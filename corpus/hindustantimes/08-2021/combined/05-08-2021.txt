The three-member team comprising Dr Himmat Singh from the National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR), Delhi, and associate professor Dr Shilpi Nain from the Lady Hardingee Medical College, Delhi, and Dr Mangesh Gokhale the of National Institute of Virology (NIV), on Thursday, began a two-day visit to the village to assess the situation. District malaria officer Dr Ajay Bendre and state entomologist Dr Mahendra Jagtap were also present during the visit. Jagtap said that the central team interacted with local health officials and suggested a few more steps to ensure that the virus is contained. “The central team inspected water storage facilities and interacted with doctors and staff from the primary health centre,” said Jagtap. Dr Bendre said that between July 20 and July 27, many samples tested positive for the virus. “Now the number has reduced as there is more awareness and more preventive measures are being taken to contain the spread. The first round of surveillance is over and we have begun a second round. We are using fumigation and checking for mosquito larvae by going door to door. We are hoping to contain the situation in the next 15 days,” said Dr Bendre. The district administration has collected samples of mosquitoes as the virus is spread mainly through Aedes mosquitoes. The administration has also collected samples for genome sequencing to identify the lineage of the virus and to find out how dangerous it could be for pregnant women. These samples have been sent to the NIV for genome sequencing. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer said that the result of genome sequencing of the samples will be available in a week’s time. “The whole process of genome sequencing takes time. And the results will be available in the next seven days. The central team will continue their visit on August 6 as well. The team will then share their observations after their visit is complete on Friday,” said Dr Awate. As of August 5, of the 158 samples sent to NIV, six tested positive for dengue, 79 for Chikungunya, 19 for dengue and Chikungunya and one for Zika and Chikungunya, while 48 tested negative for any of the infections and 14 reports are yet to be declared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/zika-ground-zero-central-team-wants-health-department-to-be-more-aggressive-with-preventive-measures-101628188196103.html

Many shop owners faced action on Wednesday and were fined by PMC officials. The Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP) is supporting the move by shop-keepers. An online meeting of the association was held and it was unanimously decided to make the protest more aggressive, till demands are fulfilled. “We are not going to stop our protests and today, we decided to reach out to many as of our members who are scared due to PMC and police action. Our demands are very simple and for the benefit of public too, we just need our timings to be changed till 7pm,” said Fatechand Ranka, president, FTAP.Association members and other unions met Pune city mayor Murlidhar Mohol on Thursday over the PMC action. “We met mayor Mohol and requested him to give instructions to PMC teams not to take any action. Accordingly, Mohol has instructed PMC officials and staff who were fining shop owners and traders,” added Ranka. Meanwhile, policemen were taking rounds of market areas like Laxmi road, Kumthekar road and Tilak road after 4 pm and taking photos of shops which were open. Bhushan Mane a footwear shop owner on FC road said, “People start shopping after 4 pm and evening is our major time to do business. How can we close the shop?

05-08-2021||Mumbai||Israel visit: HC notices to Maharashtra govt, DGIPR||The Bombay high court on Thursday issued notices to the state and the Directorate General of Information and Public Relations (DGIPR) on a public interest litigation (PIL) alleging that soon after the Assembly elections in November 2019, a delegation of senior officials embarked on a tour to Israel under the garb of studying advance web media, whereas the real object was to acquire a spying software on the lines of Pegasus. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the PIL filed by Right To Information (RTI) activists Laxman Bura and Digambar Gentyal, was informed by advocate Tejesh Dande that the petition sought action against five DGIPR officials who participated in the study tour between November 15 and 25, 2019, to Israel. The PIL stated that the tour was based on a September 5, 2019, invitation by the Consulate General of Israel. While elaborating on the issue, the petition stated that through an RTI query filed in November 2019, it was found that the five DGIPR officials led by then director Ajay Ambekar had gone on the Israel tour without following mandatory procedures as laid down in the government resolution of 2014, resulting in the misuse of public funds. The GR stipulates seeking approvals and sanctions from various authorities and the Central government for foreign tours of officials and also discourages such tours if any alternate mode, like video-conferencing, was available, so as to avoid expenses to the government coffers. The petition stated that as the cost incurred during the foreign tour was around ₹14 lakh, it was mandatory on the officials to obtain an approval from the Central government as well then Maharashtra chief minister but they permissions were taken.The RTI query, the petition stated, further revealed that the topics which the officials had gone to study included new trends in government PR, new ways of utilising web media, usage of digital marketing tools, preparation of holistic and comprehensive media plan for dissemination of government messages, utilising media in the times of emergencies and eventualities and other such topics. While stating that the topics were not significant nor revealed any substantial and specific importance which required going to Israel, the petition alleged that the tour had some other agenda. “It appears that under the garb of media management training and other allied activities, the government was sending its officials to bring other modalities in the country for misusing them during election process, including electronic voting machine hacking software etc,” the petition stated. The PIL has also referred to news reports which questioned the purpose of the tour and has claimed that there seems to be a nexus between the alleged phone-tapping case and the Israel tour. The petition, noted that though Israel had expertise in agricultural technology, contrary to it, the study tour was in respect of enhancement of usage in web media, which created reasonable suspicion as to the purpose of the tour and the motives behind it.In light of these submissions, the petition has sought a judicial inquiry into the tour and also prayed for the court to call records pertaining to the visit and inform HC as to what special knowledge the officials gained and how it will benefit the country. After hearing submissions, the bench issued notices to the state government, DGIPR and the officials, and asked them to file affidavits in reply within four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/israel-visit-hc-notices-to-maharashtra-govt-dgipr-101628187354542.html
05-08-2021||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar invites Amit Shah to visit sugar industry institute in Pune||Amid Opposition’s attempt to corner the Narendra Modi-led Central government over the Pegasus snooping reports, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Pawar has invited Union home minister Amit Shah to visit Vasantdada Sugar Institute in Pune, which is being run by the cooperative sugar industry in Maharashtra. Shah is likely to visit Pune next month.The Central government recently formed a cooperation ministry and Shah has been appointed as the first Union cooperation minister of the country.On Tuesday, Pawar had a meeting with the Union home minister in Delhi, which fuelled speculations. Later, in a series of tweets, Pawar said that he brought to Shah’s notice the two most emergent and severe issues such as the minimum support price (MSP) and permissions to set up ethanol manufacturing units within the premises of sugar mills.“When the Union home minister informed NCP chief that he is likely to visit Vaikunth Mehta National Institute of Cooperative Management (an institute in Pune that comes under the cooperation ministry), Pawar saheb said if you’re coming to Pune then you’re also invited to Vasantdada Sugar Institute,” said a senior NCP leader, requesting anonymity.Pawar had met Shah in Delhi when Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had called a breakfast meeting with Opposition leaders over the alleged Pegasus snooping controversy.However, this is not the first time that one of the senior-most Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders would be visiting Vasantdada Sugar Institute. In the past, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi and former finance minister late Arun Jaitley have visited the institute on Pawar’s invitation. Gandhi, too, had visited the institute.On July 17, Pawar met PM Modi in Delhi to discuss the amendments made by the Centre in the Banking Regulation Act to limit the rights of cooperative banks.After the NCP chief’s meetings with PM and Shah, party spokesperson Nawab Malik on Tuesday issued a clarification and said NCP and BJP share different ideologies. “Both are like two opposite sides of a river and their alliance is impossible till they are bound to their ideologies,” said Malik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sharad-pawar-invites-amit-shah-to-visit-sugar-industry-institute-in-pune-101628187054540.html
05-08-2021||Mumbai||Implement reservations in faculty recruitment: Education ministry to IITs, NITs, IIMs||The Union ministry of education (MoE) has been following up with centrally-funded technical institutions (CFTI) to implement reservations in faculty appointments, shows information received under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.HT has accessed a series of three letters issued by the department of higher education wherein MoE has asked CFTIs such as Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) to implement the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Teachers Cadre) Act, 2019 having flexible faculty cadre structure. The RTI was filed by an education activist who wished to remain anonymous.The first communication is dated September 17, 2020, followed by a letter this year on February 10. The latest in the series is a letter issued on July 16, reiterating the instructions to follow the reservations policy. Unlike other universities, all CFTIs follow a flexible cadre system. This means that the sanctioned strength of faculty at different grades is not fixed. Faculty members graduate from assistant to associate to professor positions during the course of their career. Until 2019, reservations were applicable only to entry level assistant professors. But the Central government has since extended the reservation policy to all positions. However, none of the 22 IITs in the country have more than six teachers from Scheduled Tribe (ST), while 18 of them have 10 or fewer candidates from Scheduled Caste (SC) category on their faculty rolls. Seven IITs had 10 or fewer faculty from Other Backward Classes (OBC). Of the 23 IITs in the country, data for IIT-Mandi was unavailable. It has now come to light that the Central government has been following up with institutes on the matter. Emails to Amit Khare, secretary of higher education, MoE, did not elicit any response.IIT-Bombay director Subhasis Chaudhuri said, “Yes, there has been a letter from MoE in this regard, and since IITs follow a flexible cadre structure, we shall be seeking guidance from our board of governors on this.” IIT-Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao, too, said the institute received letters from MoE on the matter.“It is not new that IITs are pushing for exemption to faculty reservation. We have learnt from the past that people from upper castes always opposed reservation. They opposed reservation in student admission also. The parliament and Supreme Court have deliberated on the issue of reservation a lot. Finally the concept of reservation has to prevail in countries like India. But as far as faculty reservation is concerned, IITs and other CFTIs are asking MoE for providing guidelines for making a reservation roster in a flexible cadre structure. It is the MoE that is delaying the implementation of faculty reservation in IITs,” said Rajesh Paswan, associate professor and convenor of Joint Forum For Academic and Social Justice, New Delhi. Paswan said the instructions issued by MoE to IITs are insufficient to ensure effective implementation of faculty reservation. “MoE should either immediately abolish the flexible faculty cadre structure in IITs and other CFTIs or issue clear cut guidelines for making reservation rosters in flexible faculty cadre structure,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/implement-reservations-in-faculty-recruitment-education-ministry-to-iits-nits-iims-101628186994605.html
05-08-2021||Mumbai||After row, Maharashtra Governor drops hostel inauguration event||Following objections by the Maharashtra cabinet over his decision to inaugurate two hostels and hold ‘review meetings’ with district officials in Nanded, Hingoli and Parbhani, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari decided against inaugurating the hostels as he began his three-day tour of the Marathwada region on Thursday but maintained that he is working as per the authority given to him by the Constitution.Reacting for the first time since the tussle between the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and the Raj Bhavan broke out over the issue, Koshyari in Nanded said, “The Constitution has given me the task of the three development boards and therefore, when I visit these districts, I call a few officials and hold discussions with them. The work happening here [in Nanded] is good and it can be implemented in other areas. As I am the chancellor, it is my duty to visit all the universities. Due to Covid-19, I could not visit them, but as cases are reducing, I am travelling again.”The governor, however, refrained from speaking on objections raised by the state cabinet over inaugurating the hostels and holding review meetings. When local reporters asked if his tour has created a political storm, the governor asked, “Are you [the media] doing [politicising] it?”“The two minority girls and boys’ hostels were already in use for the past three years and did not make sense to inaugurate it. The governor visited the university,” an official said.Raj Bhavan officials added that governor held meeting with district officials. “As per the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution, the governor has a responsibility towards the tribal areas or Scheduled Areas. He was given a presentation on the implementation of schemes for the tribal population, their education schemes, Covid-19 situation, ongoing irrigation projects, etc,” the official said.Earlier in the day, state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant had questioned what will the inauguration of the hostels, which is operational, by the governor “prove”? He tweeted that by inaugurating an old building, the image of governor gets dented. “Considering the post of the hon’ble governor, he is expected to inaugurate new buildings, education and innovative initiatives and hostels that lift the standard of education and not inaugurate a four-year-old building (sic),” he said in a series of tweets.In a seemingly tactical move by the state government, Nanded guardian minister Ashok Chavan did not receive the governor on arrival. As per protocol, the guardian minister and other district officials are expected to receive the governor or other visiting dignitaries. With the governor scheduled to visit Hingoli and Parbhani on Friday and Saturday, guardian ministers Varsha Gaikwad and Nawab Malik could also skip receiving the governor.“The government will follow the protocol, but it is not mandatory for ministers to be present,” said Parbhani guardian minister Malik, adding that Raj Bhavan did not mark copies of the schedule to the guardian ministers.Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena continued its attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). “States where BJP is not in power, they want to rule through the governors. You can see what happens in Delhi, West Bengal and Maharashtra,” said Sena leader and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut.Reacting to the criticism, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said, “The ones who are criticising are those who don’t understand the Constitution or don’t accept it. As per the Constitution, the governor is the head of state, and the chief minister and cabinet are created to aide and advise him. Therefore, nobody can tell governor to not tour the state. Other governors have toured the entire state, but no objections were raised. So, I request them [MVA leaders] to read the Constitution and then make such statements.”Meanwhile, Koshyari cleared a file containing the names recommended for Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC). The development came after minister of state Dattatray Bharne met Koshyari on Wednesday over clearing the file. This will fill up the posts in MPSC board that have been vacant for a long time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-row-maharashtra-governor-drops-hostel-inauguration-event-101628186815900.html

The agency said if the accused were allowed to get out on bail, they might pose a threat to the investigations and added that several witnesses have been threatened in the matter.The agency, through special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves, informed the court that the extension of custody of the accused – dismissed police officers Sachin Vaze, Riyazuddin Kazi, Sunil Mane and Vinayak Shinde, and bookie Naresh Gor – was necessary. The special court on Thursday also rejected the default bail application of Vaze. Vaze cited judgements by the Apex court and submitted that the agency should have filed a charge sheet within the given time to the first applied section in the first information report. He added that the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, which gives 180 days’ time to the agency to file a charge sheet, was applied later in his case.NIA judge DE Kothalikar, while rejecting his plea, said Vaze had wasted precious time of the court, but as he was in judicial custody, the court refrained from imposing any cost on him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-explosives-scare-court-grants-nia-one-more-month-to-file-charge-sheet-101628186696642.html
05-08-2021||Mumbai||Set up committee to resolve issue of train travel in Mumbai for fully vaccinated: HC tells state||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the state to form a committee to look into and resolve the issues related to train travel and also asked the government to find a solution to verify and permit fully vaccinated persons to travel on local trains. The court made the observation while hearing a bunch of public interest litigation (PILs) filed by lawyer groups and Marathi Patrakar Sangh representing media persons seeking access to local trains to fully vaccinated persons. While observing that it was imperative for all to earn a livelihood, in light of the commuting constraints that are peculiar to Mumbai compared to other cities in the state, the HC said there was a need for solutions specific to Mumbai. The court asked the state to come up with a solution for train travel within a week. The bench, while referring to the interview of Dr Shashank Joshi in Hindustan Times on the problems of train travel and commuting during Covid, noted that the doctor had said that verifying whether an aspiring commuter was fully vaccinated was a cumbersome job and told advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that “if it is cumbersome find a solution. Form an expert committee to resolve the issue”. In response, Kumbhakoni pointed to the note of caution by Dr Joshi wherein he has stated that train travel should not be allowed unless 70% of the population was fully vaccinated and said that the travel permissions for lawyers and their office staff were almost worked out. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni was informed that only essential service providers and government employees were currently allowed to travel by local trains. The rest of the population had to travel by buses, which was inconvenient and time-consuming. In the earlier hearing the court had suggested that the state should work with the railways to set up a dedicated counter to verify vaccination certificates of fully immunized persons and then issue them a separate identity card and monthly, quarterly or six monthly passes. The advocate for the Marathi Patrakar Sangh informed the court that journalists had to be on ground zero to report facts and should be considered as frontline workers. He submitted that nearly 140 journalists had lost their lives during the pandemic and their families deserved to be compensated as well. After hearing the submissions, the court observed, “Travelling by train is essential for people in Mumbai as bus charges are very high. We can say this is a city with special needs and is comparable to Calcutta or Delhi. Every time something is required, there are PILs. Why not have an administrative committee to look into such issues. These are important issues which touch the livelihood of people. If the administrative machinery is geared up to look into these issues, everything would be fine.” The court then expressed hope that the state would come up with a solution to the problem of train travel by August 15 so that “everyone could get freedom from the issue” and posted the PILs for hearing next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/set-up-committee-to-resolve-issue-of-train-travel-in-mumbai-for-fully-vaccinated-hc-tells-state-101628186574403.html
05-08-2021||Mumbai||After ease of curbs, Mumbai locals see surge in daily commuters||With the easing of Covid lockdown relaxations by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) based on the directives of the Maharashtra government, both the Central and Western Railway are witnessing an increase in the number of passengers travelling by local trains. The Maharashtra government on Monday issued orders under ‘Mission Break the Chain’ to relax curbs in 14 districts in the state. The decision for Mumbai and Thane was to be taken by the local disaster management authorities, according to the order. The BMC on Monday allowed shops and essential and non-essential establishments to remain open till 10pm. Hotels and restaurants are allowed to stay open till 4pm and all indoor and outdoor sports activities, apart from swimming, are allowed. On the Western Railway, around 700,000 passengers travelled on July 31. The number was around 1,300,000 on Monday, on Tuesday around 1,100,000 and on Wednesday around 1,000,000. On the Central Railway, around 900,000 passengers travelled on July 31, around 1,700,000 on Monday, around 1,400,000 on Tuesday and 1,300,000 on Wednesday on the main, harbour and trans-harbour lines. General public are not allowed to travel by local trains currently. Only people working in essential care, government officers and those travelling for medical purposes are allowed to commute. On an average, last week nearly 800,000 people travelled on CR daily and 500,000 on the WR. The railways have also witnessed an increase in the number of ticketless commuters. Between April and July, 304,000 passengers were fined for travelling without ticket and proper identification on the CR and 234,000 were fined on the Western Railway. A total of 90,000 commuters were fined by the Central Railway for travelling ticketless in July, as opposed to 62,000 in June. “We are seeing an increase in passengers over the past three days compared to last week, but it would be early to determine the exact increase and the cause. We have increased checks at the entry and exit points of the railway station and are also checking inside the compartments,” said a senior CR official. Passenger associations have stated that people are desperate to travel. “A number of people travelling without tickets as they have no other option left for their livelihood. This number will increase. Permitting shops to remain open till 10 pm and not allowing working people to travel is wrong. Many people working in small shops lost their jobs and are desperate,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-ease-of-curbs-mumbai-locals-see-surge-in-daily-commuters-101628186214319.html

Punamiya’s lawyer Subhash Jha opposed the plea, contending that his client’s health condition was not good and needed medical treatment.Special prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap, however, submitted that medical examination of the accused carried out in the past 48 hours showed he had no serious health issues. The court then directed police to take Punamiya to Sir JJ Hospital for medical examination. The court also granted transit remand of the two accused to Kopri police, who will produce them in Thane court on Friday and seek their further custody in the Kopri case.A special investigation team (SIT) of the Mumbai Police is probing the Marine Drive case under the supervision of deputy commissioner of police (local arms) Nimit Goyal. According to SIT, one of the two builders, believed to be close to Singh, claimed to have “settled” between 1,000 and 1,500 cases registered under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) using their clout in the police department.SIT is probing a first information report (FIR) filed based on a complaint by builder Shyamsundar Agrawal who alleged that Juhu police had filed a MCOCA case accusing him of having links with the underworld. Agrawal claimed that based on this false case, Singh and his subordinates extorted money from him at the behest of Punamiya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/extortion-case-against-param-bir-singh-thane-police-take-custody-of-arrested-builders-101628186154391.html
05-08-2021||Mumbai||Versova beach promenade work is in violation of CRZ rules?||Public works department (PWD) officials confirmed that an elevated walkway being constructed along Versova Beach will be completed in the next three to four months. The project, however, violates Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) instructions laid down at the time of recommending the project for Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) clearance in 2017. Two PWD officials involved with the project, who did not wish to be identified, said they have been given a deadline to finish the work in time for diwali in November. “So far, it has been happening haphazardly. In April and May there was no labour available because of lockdown, and then the weather became rough. If a resident raises a complaint with a senior official, we are told to stop the work for a few days,” a site engineer said, adding they were not aware of any lapse in CRZ rules. However, the minutes of an MCZMA meeting from June 2017 state that PWD has not been allowed to construct an elevated walkway or undertake any work of the scale that is currently happening on site. The sandy beach is a CRZ-I area where construction activities are prohibited, the coastal authority has noted in response to similar proposals by Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) and Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada), which have, at different times, sought to carry out “beautification” of the beachfront. PWD was allowed to go ahead with the ostensible purpose of their proposal to reconstruct an existing 1.2-km anti-erosion bundh from Picnic Cottage till the Hindu crematorium before Versova Koliwada. This bundh, PWD had submitted, was essential for protecting properties along the stretch “from further damage caused by the tidal action”. MCZMA had categorically prohibited any promenade construction or reclamation of CRZ-1 area and allowed for the bundh to be remodelled into a sea-wall. “But the current work of constructing a new wall, eight metres from the original bundh, has neither been recommended nor approved by MCZMA. The eight-metre gap has been backfilled to about 16 feet above sea level and the walkway is to be built over that, according to the plans we have obtained. What is expressly not permitted cannot be done by creative engineering. A walkway cannot be created in the garb of anti-erosion measures,” said environmentalist Zoru Bhatena, who has raised the issue with various authorities in three complaint letters dating to early 2020.HT reached out to PWD secretary Anil Gaikwad but did not receive a response.During multiple visits to the site this week, an HT team also noted that several feet of sand on the seaward side of the new RCC (reinforced concrete) wall have been buried under tetrapods, a process which began over a year and half ago, in contravention of MCZMA’s directions against reclaiming the beach. As a result, the once expansive coast of Versova beach — which was a nesting site for Olive Ridley turtles in 2018 — has been reduced to a small sliver of its former self, and the high-tide line has been significantly altered. Environmentalists and fisherfolk from Versova Koliwada said what remains of the beach is also likely to disappear in a few years. “It will look like Marine Drive. All tetrapods and no sand,” said Deepak, a fisherman and boat owner who only gave his first name.In a letter to state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on Wednesday, city-based NGO Vanashakti pointed out that reclaiming the beach in this manner amounts to breach of public trust. “Beaches are the property of the commons... To eliminate its natural character is simply contrary to the Doctrine of Public Trust. Places of scenic beauty are to be kept free from transformation and degradation... People have an inalienable right to access natural spaces and it is unconstitutional to take that right away,” stated the letter authored by Stalin D, director of the NGO.“What is being pushed as an anti-erosion project is only going to erode the beach further. When you reduce space for the water to spread on the shore, it will stagnate and pull back the sand. Erosion at Versova beach is in any case becoming a problem as tides have become stronger due to construction of coastal road. This business of reclaiming the sandy beach with tetrapods is also a way to mask the impact of the coastal road construction. Several experts had warned the civic body that other beaches will start eroding because of it,” said Stalin.Narendra Toke, chairman of MCZMA and director, state environment department, did not respond to requests for comment. Manisha Mhaiskar, principal secretary of environment department and MCZMA member, could not be reached for comment despite attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/versova-beach-promenade-work-is-in-violation-of-crz-rules-101628185856046.html
05-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 100 days after first shot, no clarity on which dose Andheri woman got||It’s been over 100 days since 58-year-old Meena Upadhyaya received her first jab of the Covid-19 vaccine, but confusion about which vaccine she received has led to a delay in her second shot. While Upadhyaya says the hospital is not confident about which dose she got, the hospital says she got Covishield. The Andheri resident took her first dose at the Holy Spirit Hospital on April 16. A receipt acknowledging the payment of ₹250 was also stamped with Covishield. On May 14, 84 days after the first shot when Upadhyaya became eligible for the second dose, she found that her certificate on Co-WIN mentioned Covaxin. “We immediately rushed to the hospital for clarity. They told us that their records showed that she was given Covaxin,” said Upadhyaya’s husband, Kishore. “But there was no vaccine stock available with them. A few weeks later, the hospital said that she had received Covishield. We are worried to take the second shot as the hospital is not confident about which vaccine was exactly administered to her,” he said. When Hindustan Times reached out to Sister Sneha Joseph, the executive director of Holy Spirit Hospital, she said that their inquiry showed that Upadhyaya was administered Covishield. “We have received Covaxin on two to three vaccination days only,” said Joseph. “We have administered Covishield on all other days. We are sure that she (Upadhyaya) was administered Covishield.” Upadhyaya is worried about the possible side effects if she lands up getting a mixed dose. In this scenario, it could be a possibility that there was an error while entering the data on CoWin. The other possibility could also be that the hospital receipt was mistakenly stamped with Covishield. Joseph refused to comment on whether there was an error in the data entry or stamping. Prashant Sapkale, assistant municipal commissioner of the K-East ward that covers Andheri, said that a mixed dose is not advisable as per the Centre’s protocol. “The hospital has to thoroughly investigate which vaccine was given and only then administer the second dose,” he said, adding, “We will look into our records about the vaccines that were supplied to the hospital. Our medical team will also visit the hospital to look into their records.” Oxford- AstraZeneca’s Covishield manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin have very distinct technologies. Covishield has been made with a viral vector platform, while Covaxin is an inactivated viral vaccine. Last month, India’s central drug authority permitted Christian Medical College, Vellore to conduct a clinical trial by mixing the two vaccines – Covishield and Covaxin. Findings of a study carried out in Spain showed potent immune response by administering a mix of Oxford–AstraZeneca and Pfizer–BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccines. Another study carried out in the United Kingdom on the same combination of vaccines observed that people experienced higher vaccine-related side effects. In June, the Indian Council of Medical Research mandated that vaccination centres stick to the protocol of administering the same vaccines. “Vaccines are meant to work on our immune system and mount the immune response to make antibodies,” said infectious disease expert Dr Om Shrivastava. “Till the evidence proves otherwise, giving mixed doses would mean unnecessarily playing with the immune system. This is not advisable.” However, physician Dr Jalil Parkar, who practises at Bandra’s Lilavati Hospital, said there is nothing to worry about in case of a mixed dose. “The safety of both the vaccines has been established,” he said. Vaccination expert Dr Naveen Thacker, who is also a former civil society representative to GAVI, the vaccine alliance board, said Upadhyaya should go ahead and take the second jab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-100-days-after-first-shot-no-clarity-on-which-dose-andheri-woman-got-101628185854410.html

Jain was addressing a virtual session hosted by Assocham India. He also said the Delhi government is preparing to set up 37,000 Covid-19 beds in order to tackle the probable third wave of the pandemic.“We have made public what our response would be. If the positivity rate now goes up to 5 per cent, then we will go for an immediate lockdown without delay,” Jain was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. The Capital on Thursday recorded a slight fall in the positivity rate to 0.08%.“Over 37,000 dedicated beds for COVID-19 patients are being set up presently and the Delhi government is preparing for the worst-case scenario so that it can save precious lives,” Jain said. Delhi took lessons from the experiences of the second wave and has ramped up infrastructure ahead of the third wave with focus on installing PSA oxygen plants to setting up more oxygen, ventilator and ICU beds, the health minister added.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) earlier approved a colour-coded response action plan under which restrictions will be placed in accordance with the severity of the Covid-19 situation in the area.Jain also said that the government is setting up ICU beds and ventilators in the makeshift hospitals which were set up to tackle the second wave. He said infrastructure is being ramped up in hospitals created at Chattarpur, Sant Nirankari Colony and Ramlila Maidan.Earlier, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal expressed concern regarding the chances of a third wave.

05-08-2021||Mumbai||602 bedridden persons got Covid vaccines at home in Mumbai, BMC tells HC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday informed the Bombay high court (HC) that 602 bedridden and severely ill persons had been administered the first jab at their homes, since the drive was started from K-East ward on July 30.Senior advocate Anil Sakhare for the BMC also informed the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni that in all 4,715 persons, who could not go to vaccination centres had registered for home vaccination in the citySakhare said BMC started the drive on a test basis from the K-East ward on July 30. He submitted that a two-member team — a doctor and a nurse visited the beneficiary along with an ambulance, administered the doses and also observed the beneficiaries for 30 minutes post-vaccination, to ascertain that there was no adverse event following immunisation (AEFI). He added that nearly 55 lakh people in Mumbai have already been vaccinated with at least one jab while 18.97 lakh people have got both jabs of the anti-Covid-19 vaccine.He was responding to public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocates Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari, seeking directions to the Centre, state and BMC to provide door-to-door vaccination to severely ill, disabled, bedridden and persons aged over 75 years. On Thursday, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni submitted that the state government had formulated a state policy for home vaccination for the immobile and bedridden persons and the drive had been successful so far. The policy, based on the views and opinions of the state Covid task force and experts, states that it aimed to reduce morbidity and prevent fatality due to Covid-19, to provide both jabs to eligible persons within the stipulated time and build population immunity against the infection. The policy further states that the jabs would be administered after receiving the written consent of the family members and the eligible persons would be given Covaxin based on its availability.During the course of the hearing on the PIL, advocate Kapadia thanked the court and the authorities for starting the home vaccination drive. However, he pointed out that certain beneficiaries were facing problems as their family doctors were not willing to give certificates stating that the beneficiary was not likely to not have an AEFI. She submitted that the BMC doctors could be asked to issue the certificates. She also expressed concerns about BMC involving NGOs in the home vaccination process and submitted that some of the beneficiaries did not have identity cards as they had been bedridden for 20 years, hence the issue should also be addressed. She also reiterated the need for a helpline number for the registration of home vaccination. After hearing the submissions, the court asked Kapadia to forward her suggestions and concerns to the state government counsel.“The state government shall consider them and if considered appropriately, proceed to implement those which are acceptable,” observed the bench and said that the drive should be given seven-eight days. The court also directed the BMC to file a short affidavit indicating the total number of bedridden people vaccinated by August 11 and also asked it to indicate the exact role of NGOs in the home vaccination drives. The PIL will be heard on August 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/602-bedridden-persons-got-covid-vaccines-at-home-in-mumbai-bmc-tells-hc-101628185375615.html
05-08-2021||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput’s death: MVA slams CBI as its probe completes a year||As the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) probe into the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput completes a year, the ruling allies in Maharashtra have slammed CBI and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government for misuse of central agencies to defame the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the unfortunate incident. They said CBI’s silence and failure to complete the investigation proves that the move was politically motivated and that it was an apt example of how these agencies are being used by the Narendra Modi government for political agenda.Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai apartment on June 14. He allegedly died by suicide. The Mumbai Police was probing the case when CBI took over the investigation on August 6. After registering a first information report (FIR), the Bihar government recommended CBI probe in the matter. Since then, there have been allegations of politics in the investigation into the actor’s death.“A year has passed since CBI started a probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s case, and CBI has not yet reached any conclusion. It has been more than 300 days since the AIIMS panel denied murder angle in the case. CBI is still deliberately silent on this matter. Who is pressuring CBI? What progress has been made in the past one year by CBI which made it a very prestigious case? Is there any order issued by the Modi government to deliberately keep the investigation in Maharashtra pending and inconclusive?” said Sachin Sawant, Congress general secretary and spokesperson of the state unit.“It was BJP’s ploy to tarnish the image of the Mumbai Police and destabilise the MVA government. The then Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey was used for this. The BJP stooped too low and openly levelled murder and rape charges, and even used the actor’s death in Bihar elections,” he added.Dr Sudhir Gupta, who led the AIIMS panel re-evaluating Rajput’s post mortem report, said the actor’s death was a suicide and not a murder. AIIMS doctors had submitted their findings to CBI on September 29 last year.“The transfer of Rajput’s case to CBI was politically motivated. A case was registered in Bihar despite having no jurisdiction as the incident happened in Mumbai. Based on the FIR, a CBI investigation was ordered. However, even after a year, CBI is unable to ascertain if it was a suicide or a murder,” said Nawab Malik, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) national spokesperson and skill development minister.He alleged that the move was a deliberate attempt to defame MVA and use it in the impending Bihar Assembly elections.Maharashtra BJP vice-president Madhav Bhandari countered the allegations saying the delay in investigation was due to non-cooperation of the Mumbai Police and the state government. “Mumbai Police are not cooperating with CBI following the directives of the state government. This is the reason the CBI probe in the matter is delayed. If MVA allies are so concerned to know what has really happened, they should ensure that the police extend full cooperation to CBI,” Bhandari told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-s-death-mva-slams-cbi-as-its-probe-completes-a-year-101628185314256.html

These vacant posts, include 63,261 in upper primary schools and 9,451 in primary schools. This is the situation when during the past three years, recruitment drives for filling up 68,500 and 69,000 vacant posts of assistant teachers has improved the situation somewhat from the past, a senior state education department official, who is in the know of things, said on condition of anonymity.A whopping 51,112 posts of teachers are lying vacant in rural upper primary schools as on June 2021 — a fact which the state government itself has accepted in the Supreme Court in June 2020. The remaining 12,149 vacant posts are in schools located in urban areas. For urban areas, teachers are not directly appointed against these posts and teachers in rural areas are transferred here, the official further said. Out of the total 13,653 posts of assistant teachers in urban primary and upper primary schools, at present mere 1,524 posts are filled while the remaining 12,128 are lying vacant. “This is due to the fact that after 2011, transfers of teachers from rural to urban areas have not taken place and each year a large number of teachers retire bringing the count of teachers down further,” said the second official pleading anonymity. What’ more, a large number of posts of principals in these schools are also lying vacant. Presently, as many as 53,778 posts of principals are lying vacant at these schools in both the rural and urban areas, the official said citing basic education department records.“The failure of the government to fill up the existing vacant posts of teachers is sad and an injustice to students enrolled in these institutions. Unless teachers are recruited, the idea of imparting education as per the RTE Act-2009 norms will continue to remain a distant dream,” said Suresh Kumar Tripathi, Teacher MLC (Allahabad-Jhansi Division).Prayagraj district president of Prathmik Shikshak Sangh Devendra Kumar Srivastava said his association had been constantly being demanding that vacant posts of teachers in both rural and urban primary and upper primary schools be filled urgently. “This is needed not just for ensuring quality teaching but also balancing the workload of the existing teachers,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/acute-shortage-of-teachers-ailing-govt-primary-upper-primary-schools-in-up-101628185254426.html

But when they go to get caste certificates, ‘Poorvi Pakistan’ word is written on them. It is a disgrace for them,” he said, adding that it was a question of their identity.Members of the Bengali community living in the district said they migrated from Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan) after Partition and were settled in the district by the central government in 1951-52. More people came later, in the 1960s and later in 1971 when Bangladesh was created, due to religious persecution and harassment. They were brought here to the Transit Camp area in Rudrapur and were settled in the Rudrapur and Shakti Farm area of the district. At present they live in Khatima, Nanakmatta, Sitarganj, Gadarpur, Bazpur also of US Nagar. Premanand Mahajan, a former two-time MLA from Gadarpur and a member of the Bengali community in US Nagar said the phrase on the certificates was considered “a blot” on the community.“Our ancestors came here just after Independence. We have been living here for decades but even then ‘Poorvi Pakastani’ word is mentioned on our certificates issued by the local administration. The chief minister’s announcement that the words will be removed from certificates is really appreciated and it has been our long-pending demand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttrakhand-not-to-stamp-east-pakistan-on-certificates-of-displaced-bengalis-101628184174461.html

On Thursday, hundreds of students and their parents protested near Bihta against low scores awarded to them by their respective schools. Irked students and parents burnt tyres on road and paralysed vehicular movement for several hours.Similarly, scores of students and parents vented their ire on a private school near Gola Road and sought clarification from the school administration over low marks given to them.Ramesh Kumar, a parent of a Class 10 student, alleged that marks computed by the school were not fair. He said, “My daughter has not scored below 80% in any exam in the last five years but she has been awarded 60% in Class 10. On the other hand, her other classmates who hardly managed to pass exams in preceding classes have been given high scores. This shows biased treatment by the school.”Meanwhile, Bihar Public School and Children Welfare Association has alleged that some private schools have awarded inflated marks to their students and sought CBSE’s intervention in the matter.Association’s chairman DK Singh said, “One Patna-based private school has awarded 499 out of 500 marks to its 17 students, besides giving above 90% marks to 85 students. Awarding such high scores to a bunch of students indicate suspicious assessment and irregularity in following the moderation policy directed by the board. Such malpractice is an injustice to meritorious students who have compromised with average marks.” “We want the board to review the school’s result and check whether the school has followed laid norms in letter and spirit or not,” he pressed.CB Singh, president of the Association of Independent Schools, appealed to Class 10 and 12 students to take the written exam for their result improvement.He said, “As a majority of meritorious students are unhappy with their results, we advise them to take the written exam and prove their merit. As CBSE would follow strictly Covid-19 safety protocols, students and their parents need not worry about infection.”CBSE released a circular for the dispute settlement process regarding the computation of results.“Disputes regarding computation of results will be referred to a committee by the CBSE. The board is preparing a policy for submitting representations to CBSE. This policy will be uploaded to the board’s website by Thursday evening. The schools that are making contact to CBSE in any form are requested to make the representations once the policy is uploaded on the website by complying the direction given therein,” said the circular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/cbse-class-10-results-students-parents-in-bihar-protest-over-low-marks-101628182554124.html

Commuter associations have stated that with relaxations in the citizens should be allowed to travel by local trains for work. Subhash Gupta, ex-member of National Railway Users Consultative Council and president of Rail Yatri Parishad gives an insight in to the problems faced by the general public without access to local trains.*The state government has refused to resume local train travel for general public for the fear of Covid transmission. What is your reaction? There is no logic in not resuming local trains for the general public due to fear of a third wave. Earlier local train services were resumed in stipulated time and they should be resumed for passengers now as well. The general public cannot commute in Mumbai in the absence of local trains, which is the only affordable mode of transport (in terms of both cost and time). People residing in suburbs such as Kalyan and far-off areas like Karjat are dependent on trains to reach their workplaces.*As coronavirus cases are increasing in Kerala, the state government is being cautious on local train travel. An overcrowded train could become super-spreader. Kerala and Maharashtra are different. The increase in cases in Kerala is not due to public transport. Public transport is operational in cities across the world. Not permitting passengers to travel will not help in reducing the number of cases. We are asking the state government to permit only working professionals to travel by trains and not leisure travel. The people who are fully vaccinated should be allowed to commute.*Doctors have stated that despite being fully vaccinated there are chances of contracting the infection. If not cautious then one could spread the virus to other people. Maharashtra has witnessed an increase in cases in rural areas. There is no local train network in the rural areas and people largely commute by their personal vehicles, so why have cases increased in rural areas? We suggested allowing fully vaccinated people as the chances of getting infected is less. Across the country all state governments are allowing vaccinated people to commute, then why not Mumbai. There is no alternative to local trains and it truly is the lifeline of the city. People have their livelihood depended on trains and keeping it suspended is only going to increase financial burden on citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/allow-vaccinated-people-in-mumbai-locals-livelihood-depended-on-trains-say-passenger-assn-101628181537145.html

As per CGST officials, they have identified atleast 19 such shell firms--barring one registered on a fake Ranchi address--which were used by firms in neighbouring states to raise fake bills and invoices to claim input tax credit (ITC). “Analysis of the firms showed that fake bills and invoices raised from these firms were used to transfer ITC (Input Tax Credit ) to other firms. During probe, it was found that seven firms were registered on the same address, while other five were registered on the same address at another location. The rest also had fake addresses. In total, these 19 firms were used to issue fake bills and invoices worth ₹294 crore,” said SK Singh, principal commissioner. Officials said most of the aforementioned firms dealt in coal and scrap in Chhattisgarh and Odisha. “We have informed our counterparts in those states to realise the due tax from these firms. The exercise was a part of nationwide effort to identify tax evasions. From April to June this year, the department has realised ₹7,000 crore across the country, wherein firms were using the same modus operandi to evade tax,” a senior official of the department said.

According to Rao, the administration plans to recommend the easing of curbs in Pune city and neighbouring Pimpri-Chinchwad, where the positivity rate is below the state average. Rao said “appropriate recommendations” for relaxations would be made to the state government, after a thorough discussion with public representatives and other district authorities. “On Saturday, we are going to conduct a weekly Covid review meeting. Based on the latest Covid data to be reviewed at the meeting, we will definitely recommend to the state government that PMC and Pimpri-Chinchwad should get relaxations.

He also appealed to traders and shop owners to be patient till Saturday, even as shop owners in the city were adamant about keeping shutters open till 7pm, defying the state government’s prescribed 4pm deadline. Rao’s comments came after Tope, speaking to HT on Wednesday, said: “If there is pressure or if there is a real need of keeping the shops open till 8 pm, then the local authorities should recommend this to the government. If a local authority like the municipal commissioner recommends shops be open till 8 pm to the government, we will consider it.” Tope’s remarks may be the first step towards breaking the deadlock between traders and the state government, as he claimed to have discussed the issue with chief secretary Sitaram Kunte. Meanwhile, Rao asked traders to be patient till Saturday and assured them that “some decision” will surely be taken. “We are continuously in touch with traders. We are thankful they have cooperated for the last 18 months. So we are not blaming them now. We are discussing and appealing to them to be patient. They have waited for so long, now it is just a matter of two days, till Saturday. Some decision will definitely be taken on Saturday and after that, ultimately, it is expected that they will behave responsibly, in terms of Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Rao. He also indicated that though the collective positive rate of the entire district exceeds the state average, separate decisions could be expected for PMC and PCMC. “The positivity rate in PMC and PCMC is not very less. I agree with the people’s sentiments. At the last meeting, there was an echo of the demand that relief from restrictions should be given. If you ask me if separate decisions can be taken for PMC and PCMC, then I feel that it could be possible,” said Rao. While denying relief to Pune city, the government has considered the entire district as one unit while evaluating the positivity rate, despite a government’s previous order clearly stating that Pune city, Pimpri-Chinchwad, and the rural parts be considered as three separate administrative units. While the city’s positivity rate for the past fortnight is around 3%, making it eligible for relaxations, Pune did not make the cut because the entire district’s positivity rate has been above 5% in July. Mayor questions Tope’s suggestion The BJP termed Rajesh Tope’s remarks as passing the ball to the PMC’s court, when different standards were applied to Mumbai. Mayor Muralidhar Mohol said, “When the state government gave relaxations in 22 districts, including Mumbai, were proposals sought from those parts?” Earlier in July, guardian minister Ajit Pawar had said that a positive decision would be taken for Pune in terms of relaxations. “When it comes to Pune, why are recommendations are being sought from the local body? There is a lack of coordination among different stakeholders in the state government and Pune is suffering because of it. State government should immediately take a decision to ease curbs in Pune. Everyone in the city has been demanding this,” said the mayor, adding that the administration, traders, business operators, and common people are asking for some relief. Changing tone?Days after he appeared tough with traders, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, on Thursday, urged the shopkeepers across the state not to violate the deadline. Earlier this week, speaking in Sangli, Thackeray said he “did not care” even “if traders have threatened to defy orders”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/divisional-commissioner-to-act-on-tope-s-prompt-will-pitch-for-relaxations-at-covid-review-meeting-on-sat-101628181053427.html

The police officer on duty at Ghonsi police station and a police chowkidar have been suspended, Jehanabad’s superintendent of police Deepak Ranjan said, without taking their names.The deceased was identified as Grijesh Kumar Yadav, 25, a resident of Lakhawar, who was taken into custody on Wednesday night in a theft case and kept in the lock-up at Ghonsi police station.Around 9 am on Thursday, Yadav allegedly hanged himself with a wire of mobile charger tied around the bars of the toilet adjacent to lock-up. He was rushed to Sadar Hospital but was declared brought dead by the doctors, the officer said. Family members of the deceased alleged the police had thrashed him inside the lock-up. Police, however, rejected the allegations and said the man was earlier jailed in a case related to motorcycle theft and was detained this time for questioning in another case. After the news of his Yadav’s broke, locals surrounded the police station and pelted stones, in which five policemen and subdivisional officer Nikhil Dhanraj were injured.The agitators later blocked Jehanabad-Patna-Gaya National Highway and disrupted vehicular traffic for more than three hours. They were demanding that the policemen responsible be booked for murder whereas the police had lodged a case of abetment of suicide.SP Deepak Ranjan said the chief judicial magistrate had been informed regarding the incident and proceedings were being carried out as per law. “CCTV footage has also been preserved to facilitate the inquiry,” he said.An autopsy has been conducted at Sadar Hospital but the report was awaited, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/mob-runs-riot-in-jehanabad-after-lock-up-death-two-suspended-101628180514440.html

Domestic passenger traffic grew around 56 -57% (at around 48-49 lakh) in July, compared to around 31.1 lakh in June 2021. According to ICRA, the airlines’ capacity deployment for July was 90% higher than July 2020 (47,200 departures in July this year against 24,770 departures in July last year). Kinjal Shah, vice president and co-group head, ICRA, “For July 2021, the average daily departures were at approximately 1,500, which is significantly higher than the average daily departures of around 800 in July 2020, and higher than around 1,100 in June 2021. Though it remains lower than around 2,000 in April 2021. The average number of passengers per flight during July 2021 was 104, against an average of 98 passengers per flight in June 2021.”“Though the recovery continued in July 2021, there is continued stress on demand, driven largely by the second wave of the pandemic, limiting travel to only necessary travel, while both leisure and business travel have been curtailed due to various state-wide restrictions, despite the decline in infections,” Shah added.While the scheduled international operations have been further suspended till August 31 the international passenger traffic for Indian carriers under the Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) is estimated at around 2.1 lakh, seeing growth of approximately 43%.Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) too witnessed a surge in passenger travel to the Tier 2 market in July. Sectors such as Hyderabad, Goa and Ahmedabad (top three tier-II sectors that performed) saw 7%, 5% and 5% passenger traffic respectively to these cities. Indigo, Air India and GoAir (the top three airlines) catered to over 3.5lakh, 80,000 and 46,000 passengers respectively. Looking at this upsurge in passenger traffic and easing of travel restrictions CSMIA reintroduced five domestic routes to Tier-2 cities like Bareilly, Visakhapatnam, Tirupati, Ajmer and Porbandar. IndiGo has started operating four weekly flights to Bareilly and five weekly flights to Tirupati. Air India will operate three flights to Visakhapatnam and five flights to Tirupati and SpiceJet will operate daily flights to Porbandar and three flights to Ajmer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/domestic-travel-recovery-continue-mumbai-airport-reintroduces-five-flights-to-tier-2-cities-101628180394050.html
05-08-2021||Patna||In a first, Bihar plans biometrics in panchayat polls to check bogus voting||The State Election Commission ( SEC) plans to use biometric technology in the upcoming panchayat polls in Bihar to check bogus voting and duplication of voters, the first such initiative in rural local bodies polls in the country, a top official familiar with the matter said.A proposal has been sent to the panchayati raj department for approval by the state cabinet. Notification for panchayat polls, to be held in 10 phases, is expected by the end of August. The SEC plans to hold election in 2-3 blocks in each district in every phase so that the poll exercise is completed by November. Amrit Lal Meena, additional chief secretary (panchayati raj), said, “The proposal for using biometric system to check malpractices is in active consideration of the government and will be approved soon. This is being done on the directions of the highest authorities in the government so that authentication of voters should be done in the panchayat polls.” Meena said voters’ authentication would be done by biometric devices and a photograph would be taken. “Real time data would be stored in the cloud, which would help in fast detection of any attempt at multiple or bogus voting,” he said. Biometric devices, along with tabs and authentication machines, would be installed at all booths where voters would first be asked to give their thumb impression and a photograph of the voter would be taken. There are 2.58 lakh posts in the three-tier rural local bodies and complaints of rigging and electoral malpractices have been common. This time, panchayat polls will be held through electronic voting machines ( EVMs) for four posts in panchayat bodies while ballot papers would be used for election in two posts of gram kutcheries, the bodies having powers to abjudicate and resolve petty disputes at the village level. SEC officials said the government is expected to spend ₹28 crore on the project, to be handled by a public sector enterprise. “Even if any voter tries to cast multiple votes at other booths in the entire block where polling is being held in the phase wise election, he/she would be easily detected as all data would be shared booth wise in real time. If there are allegations of bogus voters, each of the suspected voter would be asked to furnish their Aadhaar card or other identification document and that would be checked with the voters’ data base immediately,” said a SEC official, who has seen the demonstration of the new system. Sources said the Broadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited ( BECIL), a public sector undertaking with expertise in providing digital solutions, cyber security and other I-T related projects, has been roped in to implement the biometric system in the panchayat polls, officials said.“Such a system has not been used in any part of the country in rural local bodies polls as per my knowledge,” Meena said.On apprehensions that the new system would mean longer wait for voters in the queue, Atul Sinha, deputy director general, department of telecom, ministry of communications, New Delhi, said, “The biometric system would not slow down the voting process. During polls, voters are verified by their identity proof, be it election I-card or other papers, which takes 1-2 minutes. The biometric process will be much faster than that.” Sinha, who has led various information technology projects in Bihar, said implementing the biometric system would require very less internet speed as the biometric posh machines consume less data. “In rural areas, the internet connections have increased and posh machines can even run through mobile phone data. Besides, the booths are located near heavy public load areas where net signals are good ,” he said. In Bihar, the total number of internet subscribers is 39.34 million, of which 22.62 million are in rural areas while 16.72 million are in urban areas, as per data till 2019 mentioned in the Telecom Statistics of India report, ministry of communications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/in-a-first-bihar-plans-biometrics-in-panchayat-polls-to-check-bogus-voting-101628180335414.html

Around 3 pm, a group of people were on their way to Ramprit More when the assailants arrived and started shooting randomly in all directions, including in the air, forcing people to run for cover.“It is not clear who the assailants were and why they fired randomly at the people,” Polastu Kumar, subdivisional police officer of Maharajganj, said, adding that a manhunt has been launched. Police are looking for any CCTV footage, he said.According to eyewitnesses who were not willing to be identified, the assailants first shot one Mohammad Arman Mansoori, who died on the spot. Later, they shot another youth, later identified as Sudama Yadav, who was declared dead at Sadar Hospital in Siwan. The assailants then shot at another man, identified as Ashok Patel of Raghunathpur. They then shot at a man driving a car which blocked their way and sped away. The injured, identified as Manish Kumar of Ragarganj, has been taken to Sadar Hospital. Mohammad Yusuf, who was with Arman, said the assailants appeared to be shooting randomly without any reason. “They were shooting whoever they were looking at. Sometimes, they were shooting in the air. The young man riding pillion had three pistols. Everyone was running for cover. I saw three people fall after being shot,” he said. The police said eyewitnesses were not able to share any details about the shooters. “There is no motive known to us as of now,” said Polastu.Siwan’s superintendent of police Kumar Abhinav said forensic experts had reached the spot to collect samples and a probe was on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/men-on-bike-go-on-shooting-spree-in-siwan-two-dead-two-injured-101628179914106.html
05-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai university directs colleges to waive full fees of students who lost parents to Covid||The University of Mumbai (MU) on Thursday released a circular directing all affiliated colleges to implement fee waiver for undergraduate or postgraduate education for students who lost either or both their parents to Covid, more than a month after the state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant made the announcement. The circular also highlights partial or complete fee waivers under various miscellaneous heads for all students.“As per the directives of the Maharashtra government and the recommendations of a committee constituted by the MU vice-chancellor, reduction of fees only for the 2021-22 academic year has been recommended. 100% fee waiver should be given to students who have lost their father/mother, or both parents to Covid-19,” stated the circular dated August 4. The circular further mentions 14 heads for which colleges need to partially or fully waive off fees. In the case of the library, laboratory, gymkhana and extra-curricular activity fees, colleges should waive off 50% of the fee for all students. Similarly, colleges have been directed to waive 100% of student welfare fund, caution money deposit, library and laboratory deposits. “However, if a college has already published an online magazine, they can collect 25% of the magazine fund and in case colleges have conducted extra-curricular activities they can collect 50% of the actual fees,” states the MU circular. On June 29, following a meeting with the vice-chancellors of all state universities, Samant had announced a complete fee waiver for students who lost either one or both parents to Covid and assured this fee waiver until the completion of their undergraduate or postgraduate course. While waiving miscellaneous fees for other students, Samant also clarified that tuition and development fees levied by aided as well as unaided colleges will not be discounted. “If the pandemic situation normalises in the future and students are allowed to attend physical classes, the proportionate fee component under different heads as mentioned in the circular, including hostel fees may be charged separately by all colleges,” added the circular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-university-directs-colleges-to-waive-full-fees-of-students-who-lost-parents-to-covid-101628179194075.html
05-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Don’t make the same mistakes to spur third wave,say doctors||When the second wave started in mid-February, weddings, vacations and family functions had turned into super spreader events due to non-adherence of Covid-appropriate behaviour. Now, with further relaxations in lockdown-related restrictions in the state, health experts have cautioned citizens from ‘making similar mistakes’ to prevent the anticipated third wave.“The second wave started from high-rise buildings as they didn’t follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. They attended crowded weddings without wearing masks and went on vacations without following safety guidelines. Elderly people who are more vulnerable to Covid-19 also participated in family events,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Results of an analysis by the civic body last month showed that 91% of the total Covid-19 cases in the second wave were reported from non-slum areas. Therefore, the civic body’s main priority this time round will be high-rise buildings in the days following the relaxation of rules.“We hope that the public will learn from their mistakes. Repeating the same mistakes will certainly lead to an increase in cases,” added KakaniIn the second wave, the transmission rate was almost 100% more than the first wave due to the mutation of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Experts said any violation of safety rules can increase the positivity rate in the city which is currently below 1%.Dr Rahul Pandit, director-critical care, Fortis Hospitals Mumbai and member of the state’s Covid-19 taskforce, said the Delta variants are very infectious and can easily spread to a large number of people in small groups.“In the impending third wave of Covid-19, these factors will continue to pose big challenges. Since we now know that the Delta variant is highly infectious and spreads as quickly as the chicken-pox virus, we must not drop our guard. Social gatherings that could turn into super spreader events must be avoided, and masking-up should be taken seriously,” said Dr Pandit.Dr Harish Chafle, consultant intensivist and chest physician, Global Hospitals, Parel, said evolution and circulation of more transmissible variants of Sars-Cov-2 viruses can become a reason for the rise in a number of cases as it has happened before.Anticipating a rise in cases in the next 3-4 weeks, ward officers have already started preparatory measures with Covid-19 jumbo centres in Mulund and Dahisar instructed to reopen to handle any sudden rise in cases.“We are trying to sensitise non-slum residents about the need to maintain Covid-19 safety measures. We are making announcements about the guidelines through moving vehicles,” said Bhagyashree Kapse, ward officer, R-Central that covers Borivli.Meanwhile, BMC is planning to boost vaccination drive. In Mumbai, almost 10% of the population is fully vaccinated but, experts from the state’s Covid-19 task force said the number is inadequate to stop a possible third wave.Dr Pandit said that when the second wave hit Delhi, the seropositivity rate was 50% which indicates that 100% immunisation is key to stop the spread of the virus.“In cities across India, especially metros like Mumbai, where at least 50% of the population has received their first dose, it is important that more and more people get vaccinated. A serosurvey which was done by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) did suggest that about 50-60% of the population across the country had developed a good number of antibodies. However, that must not make us complacent,” he said.Medical experts have emphasised the need to avoid crowded places and adhere to double masking.“There is also a possibility that this Covid-19 virus might further mutate to another variant which will make it more lethal. That’s why everyone needs to get vaccinated as soon as possible so that some form of herd immunity is achieved which will prevent cross-transmission of the virus in the community,” said Dr Chafle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-don-t-make-the-same-mistakes-to-spur-third-wave-say-doctors-101628178954408.html
05-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: CET unfair, say parents; Bombay HC to hear plea today||The parents of students from the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) board are a worried lot as the Bombay high court (HC) will hear the plea of thousands of non-state board students aiming for first-year junior college (FYJC) seats, today (July 6). The parents have questioned the Maharashtra state board’s decision to conduct a common entrance test (CET) for all FYJC aspirants based solely on the state board syllabus and have also raised concerns over its decision to hold a physical entrance exam for 15 and 16-year-old students amid the pandemic. “The Maharashtra state board has argued that majority students are in favour of the CET exam, but they are going by the registration figures where 10 lakh state board students have registered for the CET, compared to less than 35,000 non-state board students. Most ICSE and CBSE students have decided to forgo a seat in the first common admission round to avoid the stress of an entrance exam, and that is not fair,” said a parent of an ICSE student. He added that only those ICSE students scared of losing a seat in a good college have registered for the test to have a good chance during seat allotment.This year, Class 10 board exams across several school education boards had to be scrapped due to rising Covid-19 cases. Results for the Class 10 batch was instead based on students’ performance in Class 9 and 10 combined. According to a circular released by the state board last month, an optional CET will be held based on the Maharashtra state board’s Class 10 syllabus. Priority will be given to students who appear for this exam in the first seat allotment list for FYJC seats. It will be a 100 marks multiple-choice question format exam held over two hours. The exam will have questions from seven different subjects including English, Mathematics, Science and Social Sciences, each carrying 25% weightage in the test and students need to attempt only four papers out of these.“ICSE board allows students to drop subjects like Maths and Science in Class 9 and 10 and now suddenly, the state board expects our children to appear for the entrance exam based on subjects or topics they’ve never studied. What’s worse is that the board is insisting on an entrance exam despite a Supreme Court order clarifying that CET should only be held for admissions to professional courses,” said the mother of another ICSE student.While the HC had asked heads of ICSE, CBSE and IGCSE boards to submit question banks to the state board, parents are still hopeful that the court on Friday scraps the CET exam altogether.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cet-unfair-says-parents-bombay-hc-to-hear-plea-today-101628178653910.html
05-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai university starts admission process; students stress over high cut-off list||The University of Mumbai (MU) on Thursday started the sale of admission forms, kicking off the admissions process to undergraduate degree courses across its 800-odd, affiliated colleges. With Class 12 results behind them, degree aspirants will now face the difficulty of ensuring admissions in a college and course of their choice. For years, the seat allotment merit lists announced by the university kept throwing a higher cut-off across traditional and self-financed courses, however this year, colleges fear an explosion of high scorers taking over the first three merit lists, leaving very little wiggle room for the rest. “A few years ago, Delhi University colleges had witnessed their first merit lists ending at 100%, this year it might happen in some Mumbai college as well,” said the principal of a south Mumbai college on condition of anonymity. “With a high number of Class 12 students across boards scoring 90% and above this year, students with scores below 90% will find it tough to bag a seat in any of the top city colleges, especially in self-finance courses,” he added. Increasing Covid cases forced most school education boards to scrap their Class 12 exams this year and instead assess students based on their performance in Class 10, 11 and 12. The final result brought forward an explosion of students joining the 90% bandwagon. While ICSE and CBSE schools boasted of nearly 50% or more of their Class 12 students scoring above 90-95% this year, the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) announced Class 12 results this week and the number of 90% scorers across the state jumped 12-folds compared to last year. For the first time, 46 HSC students also managed to score a perfect 100% this year. According to MUs admissions schedule, pre-admission registrations will go on till August 14 and colleges will have to complete the in-house and minority quota admissions by August 14 as well. The first open merit list is scheduled to be announced on August 17 this year. “Since in-house quota students will be given first preference for traditional courses (BA, BCom, BSc), there’s a good chance that most colleges will not have a single seat left for outsiders for the general merit list,” said TA Shiware, speaking for the management of Wilson College. He is also the chairman of the Mumbai Association of Non-Government Colleges.Questions have already been raised regarding the higher number of students clearing Class 12 exams this year compared to previous years. “This automatically means more students will apply for degree colleges. Looking at this issue the Maharashtra government had previously suggested that colleges be allowed to increase their intake capacity to accommodate more students. There is, however, nothing on paper as yet and we are unsure if we are allowed to admit more students,” said Naresh Chandra, principal of Birla College, Kalyan. This concept of increased intake has been questioned by many experts, especially considering the limited infrastructure available in city colleges. “Increasing intake capacity or adding new divisions for courses means colleges will have to continue this system for the next three years till this batch graduates. While this works fine during online classes, most colleges will run short of space once physical classes begin,” added Shiware, and highlighted that aided colleges are currently also struggling with vacant teacher posts and increasing intake will create problems for colleges.While most colleges are sure they will have no seats left for open category merit lists after filling up traditional courses with in-house and minority quotas, many fear a high number of admissions withdrawals once merit lists for self-finance courses begin. “Every year students confirm seats in traditional courses as a back-up plan and wait for their names to appear in the merit list of a self-finance course. This year too I fear a large number of seats will go vacant after every round of seat allotment, making the admissions process more chaotic than ever,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College, Bandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-university-starts-admission-process-students-stress-over-high-cut-off-list-101628178414473.html

The advertisement for the application process would be released on August 23 and the computerised draw would be held on October 14 this year.These houses would be located in places like Virar, Mira Road, Shirdhon, Khoni, Gotheghar and Vengurla.According to housing minister Jitendra Awhad, the majority of the houses have been set aside for the weaker sections of society. “We have kept 97% of the houses for the economically weaker section (EWS) and the lower income group (LIG),” said Awhad. “The entire computerised lottery system would be held in a transparent manner,” he added.EWS covers the section whose family income is less than ₹25,000 per month, while LIG covers the section whose family income is in the range of ₹25,000- ₹50,000 monthly. The next two — middle-income group (MIG) comes in the salary range of ₹50,000 to ₹75,000 while the higher income group (HIG) are those, whose family income is more than ₹75,000 monthly.In recent years, the peripheral areas of Mumbai have seen exponential growth as realty prices here are less compared to Mumbai. Mhada houses are popular due to their low prices compared to private builders and also the titles are clear.Awhad further announced that Mhada is planning to construct 10,000 houses in cities like Nashik, Nagpur, Amravati, Pune and Aurangabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-mhada-announces-lottery-process-for-8-205-low-cost-houses-101628176913926.html

This means methods in which the straw is moved from its original place. The most common way is to tie the straw in bundles and supply it as fuel in biomass-based power generation plants, industrial boilers and in coal based-super critical power generating units.To date, the focus has been on cost-intensive in-situ management of straw. The commission, formed in 2020, sent a communique to Punjab government on July 28 to change tack. Experts say ex-situ management involves lower cost.“The commission has asked Punjab to formulate a policy to establish a supply chain system so that stubble is available to the user during the year, for which storage facilities also need to be maintained,” said Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) member secretary Krunesh Garg. “The state government is advised that paddy straw-based biomass pellets and torrefied charcoal can be used in thermal plants for co-firing up to a blend ratio of 10% without any boiler design modifications,” an advisory from the commission to the state reads. On July 13, the commission had met organisations such as Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI), Indian Council for Agriculture Research (ICAR), along with Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments. Here, the National Thermal Plant Corporation (NTPC) had accepted that paddy straw could be used in 17 plants it runs; this will consume 50 lakh tonne stubble. Punjab’s science, technology and environment and power departments are working on a proposal to increase for ex-situ management of the paddy straw. “The commission has suggested using straw in manufacturing ply-board, packaging material and even furniture. The commission has also asked the state and the Centre to make a fund outlay report,” an official said. Over 220 lakh tonne of paddy stubble is produced a year. Biomass power generating plants in the state consume 50 lakh tonnes; of the remaining 170 lakh tonne, 100 lakh tonne is not managed, with the majority of farmers prefer burning it. Due to high silica content, paddy straw is not used as dry fodder, like wheat straw. During paddy harvest in Oct-Nov, stubble is a major health hazard. The number of machines (76,590) given to the farmers in the last three years (2018-2020) are insufficient to deal with stubble burning menace, department officials said, adding that the Centre has given ₹666 crore as subsidy for in-situ management for the past three years. A subsidy of ₹250 crore has been sanctioned for the current year. “The window between paddy harvest and wheat sowing is short so stubble can’t be managed with the machines available,” said an official of the agriculture department, adding in the current year, at least 25,000 agro-machines will be given to farmers for in-situ management of paddy residue. “We are exploring the option of raising funds from Centre’s renewable energy ministry,” Garg, of PPCB, added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/change-tack-on-paddy-stubble-issue-central-panel-tells-punjab-101628176313827.html

Those arrested include people living in Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida and Gurgaon.The call centre was operational since last one year from the special economic zone (SEZ) in the Bisrakh area, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central Noida) Ankur Aggarwal said."A total of 32 people have been arrested from the call centre that was duping American citizens. The accused would interact with the US citizens over internet and send bugs into their computer system but scare them by telling that their system has got a virus," he said."The accused would then offer them a solution for virus removal and ask the target to transfer money for the service being provided by them. The accused would then remove the bug created by them only," the officer said.The accused would seek up to USD 1,000 (approximately ₹74,000 as per Thursday's exchange rate) in exchange of their "service", DCP Aggarwal told reporters."The call centre made a profit of up to USD 4,000 every night and they had been operational for around a year now, as per information gained from the accused during questioning. The fraud amount is well in crores of rupees," he said, adding that employees working on calls were paid ₹20,000 a month while the manager was getting ₹1.25 lakh to ₹1.50 lakh monthly.He said around 15 to 20 more people, including the mastermind behind the con job, have been identified and search is on to track and arrest them.An FIR has been lodged at the Bisrakh police station under Indian Penal Code sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and under provisions of the Information Technology Act, the police said.The police have seized 50 computers and related devices from the call centre, where people worked overnight in order to match the normal work hours in the US, they said.

Banerjee said educational institutes might reopen in West Bengal on alternate days after the Durga Puja vacation in November.“However, nothing has been finalised just yet,” Banerjee said while addressing reporters after holding a meeting of Global Advisory Board (GAB), headed by Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee, at the state secretariat, Nabanna. The Nobel laureate is in Bengal to discuss the government’s pandemic-related strategies.The chief minister’s comments on Thursday come weeks after a senior education department official said the state government had no plans to reopen schools at any level in the near future due to the threat of the third wave of the pandemic.The official said that whenever schools reopen, students of higher classes will be the first to start attending offline classes and not those who belong to primary classes. This was in response to a statement from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director general Balram Bhargava, who had said it will be wise to reopen schools across India for primary section students as they can handle the viral infection better than adults.“We had sought to start on-campus classes at secondary and higher secondary levels in February before the second wave. But the virulence of the pandemic changed the situation and campus activities had to be entirely stopped,” the Bengal education department had added.In July, several states, including Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, have partially reopened their schools following a downfall in daily Covid-19 cases. This month, so far, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh have started physical classes.West Bengal has so far reported 15,30,850 cases, 18,180 deaths and 15,01,925 recoveries due to the coronavirus disease. On Wednesday, 826 new cases, 10 deaths and 838 recoveries were reported, according to the health department’s bulletin.

Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Nallasopara unit has demanded that the award be taken back as seven Covid-19 patients died in the hospital on April 12 due to oxygen shortage.The award was sponsored by a national Hindi newspaper and the event was attended by state health minister Rajesh Tope. “It is surprising that the award was given to a hospital in Nallasopara where seven Covid patients died,” said Manoj Barot, a BJP worker who has written to the Governor. “We demand that the Governor take back the award,” he said. Dr Sachin Jadhav, personal assistant to Tope, said, “The government has no role in the selection of the names of the awardees.”Dr Upadhyay said, “The award was not self-recommended. I accepted it from the Governor with humility. The award was bestowed to my three-year-old hospital for the yeoman service to the community in providing medical services in 2020. We dedicated our hospital for Covid patients.” He further said that Vasai Virar civic health department has given the hospital a clean chit and concluded the patients did not die of oxygen shortage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/revoke-award-given-to-nallasopara-hospital-where-7-covid-patients-died-bjp-to-governor-101628167253475.html

She wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to ramp up the supply of vials. In her letter, Mamata expressed apprehension that the Covid-19 situation in Bengal might escalate if the vaccine supply is not augmented.“West Bengal will require around 14 crore doses of Covid vaccines to cover all the eligible people. Presently, we are administering four lakh doses per day and are capable of administering 11 lakh doses per day. Yet, we are getting a much lower number of doses despite having a very high population density and a higher rate of urbanisation,” the West Bengal chief minister wrote in her letter.Mamata also alleged that other states are being provided with a larger number of vaccine doses. She said other states can get a higher number of doses but Bengal cannot be deprived of doses. “I cannot remain a mute spectator to see Bengal deprived,” Mamata wrote. Mamata said several letters were sent to the Prime Minister but the Centre did not pay ‘due attention’ to Bengal’s needs. According to news agency ANI, the Bengal chief minister claimed that Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka received more vaccine doses. Mamata said that the positivity rate in the state is currently at 1.57% due to the state government’s efforts. People familiar with the developments told news agency PTI that over 30.9 million people have been vaccinated against Covid-19 in Bengal.

The panchayat polls notification in 10 phases is expected to be done by the end of August. The SEC plans to hold election in 2-3 blocks in each district in every phase so that the poll exercise is completed by November.Under the proposal, biometric devices along with a tab and authentication machines would be installed at all booths. Voters would first be asked to give their thumb impression and their photograph would be taken. The government is expected to spend ₹28 crore in the project to be handled by a public sector enterprise.Also Read | Bihar varsity cancels admission of 24 PG students citing ineligibilityThere are 258,000 posts in the three-tier rural local bodies and complaints of rigging , electoral malpractices have been a common grievance of voters and candidates.

05-08-2021||Pune||Taste of Life: Restaurants on the reform menu for this social educationist||People all around the world have eaten away from home for centuries, but the restaurant as opposed to the inn or the khanaval, food-stand or other convenience or necessity, has existed for merely 250 years. Even though Marco Polo wrote about restaurants being operational in China in the 10th century, the modern restaurant was born in Europe in the mid-eighteenth century, and it took a century more for it to reach India.Bombay and Calcutta boasted of a few European restaurants in the mid-nineteenth century which almost exclusively served the wealthy European clientele. These institutions had all the characteristics that could be attributed to the modern restaurant – waiters, menus, longer operational hours than an inn. But, these restaurants did not cater to the common Indian population. Travelers, pilgrims, students expected to be fed, and the options were limited. “Pune Bhojanagruha”, the first modern, “native” restaurant in Pune and Maharashtra, owned by Narayan Ramchandra Ponkshe opened in June 1881, and started to fill this void.The restaurant, unfortunately, could not sustain itself shut its doors in 1884. Vishnushastri Chiplunkar, one of the tallest social leaders in Maharashtra then, had actively supported the endeavour. It is likely that he had made a financial investment in the restaurant. He had written an editorial in “Kesari” in 1882 to make people aware of the restaurant. Chiplunkar was not alive when the restaurant closed down.It was Gopal Ganesh Agarkar, social reformer, educationist , and the founder-editor of “Kesari”, who took it upon himself to sell Maharashtra on the necessity of the modern restaurant. Between 1885 and 1887, he wrote two articles in “Kesari” elaborating the need for restaurants in developing cities like Pune. He followed it up with another article on the same topic in 1893 in his newspaper “Sudharak”. All three articles were titled “Bhojanagruha”.The first of Agarkar’s articles appeared on February 10, 1885. The articles (which I found arduous to translate into English) are full of his signature sarcasm and wit. They are excellent specimens of his brilliant command over the language and could be considered among the finest articles on food ever written.“We had written an article a few years ago informing our readers about a Western establishment named ‘Bhojanagruha’. The building flaunted a big signboard bearing the name, and it was a testimony to the changing times in Pune. We were very sure that the Bhojanagruha would be a great success. But unfortunately, we were proven wrong”, he admits in the beginning and then proceeds to enlist the reasons behind this debacle – patrons not paying for their orders, lack of quality of food, mismanagement at the restaurant. He attributes the loss made by the restaurant to the first cause. If the proprietor is not paid for the food, how is he supposed to buy groceries for his establishment, he asks.Agarkar’s article mentions some dishes from the menu at “Pune Bhojanagruha” – Bhakari (flatbread made of jowar or bajra), rice, tempered dal, buttermilk, laddoos, and chiwda. These dishes were praised by many when the “Bhojanagruha” started, but later, because the clients were unwilling to pay on time, the quality suffered. The buttermilk turned watery and tasteless, the bhakaris were chewy, and it was impossible to find pulses in the dal, Agarkar writes.The article brings forth an unfortunate outcome of this debacle. The owner of the “Bhojanagruha” went bankrupt due to non-paying patrons. This also explains why the “Bhojanagruha” had to change its location almost every year. Agarkar rues the loss suffered by the proprietor, but advises his readers not to be wary of this incident, and start another “Bhojanagruha” as soon as possible.The lack of restaurants in Pune and Maharashtra was not a perfunctory concern for Chiplunkar and Agarkar. They genuinely believed that restaurants were important markers of the development of a city and the nation. “A Bhojanagruha is an important institution for the development of a city and its inhabitants. The restaurants should be encouraged and helped in every possible way. We have this misguided habit of ridiculing entrepreneurs and businessmen. They are absolutely necessary if we need to make our country self-reliant. I regret that we failed the Bhojanagruha”, Agarkar concludes.Agarkar’s second article which appeared in 1887 tows the same line. He begins by admonishing his readers for not paying at the “Bhojanagruha”. “Our people have this peculiar habit of saving as much money as possible. They either bury it under their houses or in their fields or buy jewellery for their wives and daughters. This custom was acceptable during the reigns of the Mughals or the Peshwas when people were worried about protecting their wealth. But these days one could travel from Banaras to Rameshwar fearlessly with all their money. So one should also be fearless in spending it. Rather than using it to make jewellery, one should have paid for the food at khanavals and Bhojanagruha, or start a business”, he writes.He then makes his readers aware that there is no shame in starting a restaurant. “This business is a respectable one like any other, and should not be discouraged. We need educated people who understand economics to start Bhojanagruhas. I myself have studied the trade a bit, and I think that it is possible to earn a profit of Rs30 each month if one goes on to invest Rs500 to start a Bhojanagruha. This business definitely gives high returns, and it is unfortunate that nobody has thought of starting one after the previous debacle”, he writes. Students and travellers are suffering due to the lack of respectable restaurants, and the citizens of Pune should step forward to feed them and earn money in return, he urges. One of the brilliant features of this article is the appeal he makes to women. “This business is ideal for women. They should start a Bhojanagruha instead of staying home and cooking for their families. They would be able to earn a respectable amount and would soon be able to support their families”, he writes.Agarkar wanted Pune to have at least 10 colossal buildings housing “Bhojanagruhas”. The buildings should have big signboards announcing the names, he wrote. This wish remained unfulfilled during his lifetime. But within a few decades the restaurants in Pune, and India, became a site of supposedly healthful eating. They indeed became markers of the prosperity of the country. We have to be grateful to Ponkshe, Chiplunkar and Agarkar for that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-restaurants-on-the-reform-menu-for-this-social-educationist-101628160774991.html

Residents of the Jat-dominated village came out on the streets to congratulate the Sumit’s family. But behind Thursday’s glory is a story of focus and struggle.Also read: Festival at Surender’s home in Haryana after Olympic bronze in hockeyTravelled ticketless to save for fruits Midfielder Sumit Kumar, who belongs to a landless labourer’s family, did odd jobs, including working as a dhaba cleaner, to make ends meet. His elder brother, Amit Kumar, quit playing hockey so that Sumit could get the facilities needed to make it to Team India. “Before selecting the sports hostel in Gurugram, Sumit worked at dhabas in Murthal for five years so that he could arrange for the diet and other expenses. Milk was a luxury. During his early days, he used to travel in trains without ticket to save for meals and fruits,” Amit said. Amit recalled that Sumit had started playing hockey simply to get a pair of shoes and a hockey stick being provided free by the academy coach at their village. “Slowly, he started spending the entire day on the hockey ground. At one time, we thought that he might quit the game due to the family’s poor financial condition, but he continued. After three years at the sports hostel, Sumit was selected in the Sports Authority of India’s (SAI) north zone Bahalgarh centre. He didn’t visit home even on weekends to save on the bus fare,” Amit said. Skipped brother’s wedding for hockey Sumit’s village coach Naresh Kumar said that he was so passionate about hockey that he did not attend the wedding of his elder brother, Jai Singh, who worked as a labourer. Sumit has dedicated the bronze medal to his mother Darshna Devi, who passed away last year. “My mother worked as a domestic help to bring us up.

Tanna, who is in construction business claimed that Singh and his team extorted crores of rupees by threatening to get him involved in a fake crime case. They allegedly also threatened to carry out his encounter if he does not pay. Tanna’s lawyer Sagar Kadam said, “ We submitted a letter to DCP, stating that some of the accused in this crime have their personal weapons with them which are yet to be recovered by police. All the accused have their passport with them therefore there is chance that they may fly out of India. If they are not arrested early, they can file false complaint against me and other complainants to pressure us. They can remove evidence in the above crime and also influence witnesses. Therefore, my client requested that they be arrested soon. My client is ready to assist police to locate their hideouts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/extortion-case-police-start-process-of-lookout-notice-against-param-bir-singh-101628159932709.html

05-08-2021||Chandigarh||Ruckus in Himachal assembly over chief secretary’s transfer||Noisy scenes were witnessed in the Himachal Pradesh assembly on Thursday as the opposition Congress protested the removal of chief secretary Anil Khachi and walked out of the House when it was told that the appointment of officials was the prerogative of the government. Also read: India prepared for long haul with China over LadakhAs soon as question hour ended, leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri raised a point of order, seeking the clarification from the government. Referring to Khachi’s Himachali background, Agnihotri sought to know the circumstances that prompted the government to change the chief secretary. Ram Subhag Singh is new chief secretary Earlier in a notification on Thursday, the state government appointed Khachi, a 1986-batch IAS officer, as the state election commissioner with immediate effect. Khachi was appointed the chief secretary in 2019. Ram Subhag Singh, a 1987-batch IAS officer who was serving as additional chief secretary industries, transport and labour and employment, has been appointed the new chief secretary. Raising the matter in the assembly, Agnihotri said that earlier another Himachali officer, VC Pharka, was the chief secretary but was removed by the Jai Ram Thakur government. He said Vineet Chawdhary and BK Agarwal also served on the post but were removed. “What is it that is forcing the government to change the chief secretary for the sixth time?” the Congress leader said. In his reply, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said that the opposition is not to decide the appointments. Appointments prerogative of govt: Speaker Speaker Vipin Singh Parmar ruled that the issue can’t be raised in the House. “The appointment of officers is the sole prerogative of the government,” he said ruling that nothing would go on record. At this, the Congress created a ruckus and walked out of the House. Speaking on the issue after the opposition’s walkout, the chief minister said that this issue could not be raised in the assembly and the House does not decide whom to appoint. Thakur said that the government had followed the due process in shifting the officer. He criticised Agnihotri for categorising officers based on their domicile. He said sorting the officers as those from the state and those from outside the state was wide off the mark. “Officers belong to the country and contribute to the development of the state to the best of their capacity and capability,” he said. Referring to the chief secretaries appointed as adviser during the previous Congress rule, the chief minister said Khachi has been appointed on a constitutional post where his tenure will be for five years and status equal to the High Court Judge. “If we look back, the Congress had appointed the chief secretary by ignoring the seniority of other officers,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ruckus-in-himachal-assembly-over-chief-secretary-s-transfer-101628154592299.html

05-08-2021||Kolkata||Eye on election: TMC’s Abhishek Banerjee sets up team to visit Tripura every month||With an eye on the Tripura assembly elections, the Trinamool Congress’ (TMC) national general secretary and chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee has set up a team comprising senior leaders who will be camping in the northeastern state every month. The team comprises veterans, including ministers such as Bratya Basu and Moloy Ghatak, members of Parliament such as Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, trade union leader Ritabrata Banerjee, former legislator Samir Chakraborty and other senior leaders such as party spokesperson Kunal Ghosh. “TMC leaders will be camping in Tripura to help the party expand its base ahead of the elections. Abhishek Banerjee himself went to Tripura earlier this week. This will help boost the party’s grassroot level infrastructure and let them know that senior party leaders are standing beside them,” said a TMC leader, requesting anonymity. The TMC, after returning to power in West Bengal for the third consecutive term with a sweeping victory in the recently held assembly elections, is now eyeing Tripura where assembly polls are due in 2023. The state is currently ruled by BJP - Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (BJP-IPFT) alliance. Also Read | Bengal’s advisory board, led by Abhijit Banerjee, to discuss impending 3rd waveAfter achieving a resounding victory over the BJP in the recent West Bengal assembly elections, the TMC renewed its contract with Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC), the company launched by election strategist Prashant Kishor, till the crucial 2024 Lok Sabha polls in which Mamata Banerjee wishes to see her party play a bigger role in national politics. Recently, a team comprising Basu, Ghatak and Ritabrata Banerjee visited Tripura after the Tripura Police purportedly confined the I-PAC team. Ghatak and Basu again went to Tripira ahead of Abhishek Banerjee’s visit. Abhishek Banerjee, who is seen as the in-charge of the party’s expansion plans, announced in June this year that they plan to expand their base in other states ahead of the 2024 national polls to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). For the first time, the TMC observed Martyr’s Day - the party’s flagship programme – in Tripura, Delhi and a few other states on July 21. “The TMC’s state unit in Tripura will be changed and the new set up will be announced in the next few days. Later, the district and block presidents will also be appointed. The party has plans to set up booth committees by December this year,” the TMC leader quoted above said. The BJP, however, said that the TMC has hardly any presence in any state outside Bengal. “The TMC doesn’t have any presence in any state. Let them first form their base. They can think of elections later. It is a democratic country, and anyone can go anywhere. But this is just a gimmick to divert attention from the NHRC report,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/eye-on-election-tmc-s-abhishek-banerjee-sets-up-team-to-visit-tripura-every-month-101628153632405.html

05-08-2021||Delhi||At Cannes, people pointed out my short height: Masoom Minawala||Masoom Minawala is on a journey to put Indian fashion on the global map. The blogger, who walked the red carpet for the second time at the Cannes Film Festival, earlier this month, turned heads in a stunning white chiffon stitched saree. While her look garnered much appreciation, she had to face her fair share of trolling as well. “When I was at Cannes, some people pointed out my short height. While I do receive appreciation, I also get criticised about things that I didn’t even know were supposed to be controversial. From a simple word that I may have written in my caption to my physical attributes, everything seems to be on the radar,” she reveals. So how does she counter it? The 27-year-old feels the key to facing such negativity is to become comfortable with your own self. “As a public figure, you receive some backlash daily. The only way to overcome all of it is to keep my composure and authenticity off-screen and on-screen,” she shares. Knowing she has a duty to make her nation and the fashion industry proud, comes with a certain amount of responsibility. To keep the pressure at bay, Minawala makes sure she stays well hydrated and confident in her skin. She continues, “I just feel grateful to be able to represent my country and its culture on such a massive global scale. At the same time, I feel responsible for living up to my industry’s expectations and empowering Indian fashion. It’s a celebration of my work and all the strength and persistence that goes towards it. The fact that I’m getting closer to my mission of taking Indian fashion to global avenues makes it all worth it.”The fashionista reveals that while visiting Cannes felt surreal, she never even dreamt about it during her years of blogging. Recalling the experience, she shares, “When you are surrounded by all the biggest names in the industry and cameras, and also representing your country, it is natural to feel nervous, like I did. But I make sure I step out of my comfort zone from time to time to gain that confidence. It’s good to remain comfortable but getting experimental once in a while gives you courage.” While Minawala wore several outfits at the French Riviera, she chose a saree at the red carpet as a homage to desi fashion. She says, “What better way to represent my country than with our iconic silhouette. I stuck to a traditional saree with a contemporary twist as created by Manish Malhotra’s magical sartorial abilities. It felt empowering to be able to stand on a global platform like that wearing a saree with pride.”Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-cannes-people-pointed-out-my-short-height-masoom-minawala-101628148292051.html
05-08-2021||Delhi||I want to try street food from North India: Justin Narayan||Be it major sporting events like the Tokyo Olympics or culinary competitions like MasterChef Australia, Indians are making the country proud in every field. Such was a feat achieved by Justin Narayan, an Indian-origin chef from Perth who won the 13th season of the popular cooking show, with his modern renditions of a number of traditional Indian delicacies. “Indian food has a lot of layers and complexity of spices. Its understanding helped me drive flavour in a short span of time,” says the chef, whose roots go back to Chennai, Tamil Nadu. He also reveals that he enjoys experimenting with Indian flavours. “I like my take on a few dishes, it was my play on Indian flavours. I made a version of my mum’s chicken curry, I did a version of dal bhaath, I even did a chicken taco dish with Indian curry spices in it. I also prepared a lamb curry sauce for the semi-final cook. It was like my modern take on a lot of different Indian food,” he says.Narayan, who was up against Pete Campbell and Kishwar Chowdhury, is the second Indian-origin winner of the competition — Sashi Cheliah was the first, having won the tenth season. But, the 27-year-old’s triumph was celebrated across the country. “It was very overwhelming. A lot of people have been so kind to write incredible comments and messages, and it’s a huge honour to be able to represent my culture. It feels great to have won that competition and to represent Indian culture on a stage like MasterChef,” says Narayan, who wishes to dedicate his prize money ($250,000) for the welfare of underprivileged children in India. “I’m definitely going to try and work towards using the money to start a restaurant that would help contribute towards (welfare of) kids in slums. When I was in India on my last trip, it was impactful to see those children. I’m passionate about doing this, and if I can participate with an organisation that’s doing that already in an incredible way, why not?” he says.When it comes to Indian food, what would he say is his all-time favourite? “Masala dosa with all the chutneys on the side,” he says, but is quick to add, “There’s just so much to choose from, so it’s quite hard to narrow it down. I have visited Delhi and Agra as well. However, I need to visit more places, discover and try more food. I can’t wait to try street food from north India on my next trip.” Viewers can watch the show on Disney+ Hotstar Premium and Disney+ Hotstar VIP.

The labourers who were employed to work on the doubling of the railway track from Vasco to Karnataka, which is being staunchly opposed by environmental and anti-coal activists, were found to be staying next to railway track in unhygienic conditions, without proper shelter and toilet. “Some of the labourers were found to be as old as 72 years. The labourers complained about not receiving minimum wages, restrictions regarding returning home, no ESI - Provident Fund,” Arun Pandey of Anyay Rahit Zindagi, the NGO that was involved in their rescue, said.

Including children, the number of people at the camp was 19. Speaking to HT, Vasudev Rao of the Telangana-based National Adivasi Solidarity Council said that the sub divisional magistrate has filed a report before the collector and further legal action is being pursued. “We work with the SC/ST and adivasi people in Telangana and during our work we were informed that these labourers were kept in bonded labour conditions. So we initiated action with the help of the local NGO and complained to the district magistrate,” Vasudev told HT. A group of labourers who is underpaid and not allowed to visit home qualifies as bonded labour. The contractor who had arranged the labourers on behalf of Track and Towers Infratech Ltd has been booked and is being proceeded against as per the law, authorities said. For now, the contractor has agreed to pay them the difference in wages, but if found guilty, he will have to pay further compensation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/14-daily-wages-rescued-from-bonded-labour-in-goa-101628135811418.html

At times the children are used as a tool to settle their personal score in matrimonial proceedings,” said the representation.Also Read | Number linked to ex-Supreme Court judge, lawyers on latest Pegasus list“It is observed that the children are the silent sufferers and mostly not heard and not represented parties in the matrimonial proceedings. In many cases children are at high risk to suffer from Parenting Alienation Syndrome (PAS) which is affecting the mental health and psychological aspects of children (sic),” the association’s letter added. The association believes that an independent children’s lawyer would help to protect the child’s interest in maintenance, custody /access and other related issues to the welfare and upbringing of the children. The association has also suggested a host of guidelines for the independent children’s lawyer and those include that they shall be in regular touch with the child before every date and shall express the child’s views before the Court. The independent children’s lawyer, according to the association, should look into the academic performance of the child, and in case of child sexual abuse the independent children’s lawyer shall visit Child Welfare Committee (CWC) or police or other authorities concerned and report it to the court. The association also suggested that the independent children’s lawyer can get the help of a child psychologist if a child needs one. The concept of appointing independent children’s lawyer began in December 2019 when family court judge PL Palsingankar for the first time ordered appointment of an independent lawyer for a seven year old boy whose parents failed to come to terms over the issue of access to the child during school vacations. The court said independent lawyers should be appointed for children, especially where there are allegations of abuse or neglect in relation to the child / children, in highly contested matters, where there are allegations of tutoring the children and mental health issues alleged to exist in relation to one or both of the parents.While describing the role of the independent children’s lawyer, the court said, “the independent children’s lawyer shall give his/her frank opinion about of the health physical and mental of child/children, progress of child/children academic and extra curricular, attachment with parents, use of the child/ children, independent opinion whether child/children is/are tutored or brain washed by particular parent either custodial or non custodial.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/form-independent-lawyers-panel-to-protect-children-s-interests-bar-assn-to-family-court-in-mumbai-101628134611155.html

05-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi Lieutenant Governor’s Covid meet sparks fresh row with state govt||A review meeting convened by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on Wednesday regarding the Covid-19 situation in Delhi has led to a fresh conflict between the elected government in Delhi and the Raj Bhavan, with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal saying the LG holding parallel meetings without informing the state government is “against the Constitution”.The LG on Wednesday tweeted about a Covid-19 review meeting with chief secretary Vijay Dev, additional chief secretary (home and health) Bhupinder S Bhalla, divisional commissioner Sanjiv Khirwar, Delhi Metro chief Mangu Singh and other senior officials, and the directions issued to the officials.Kejriwal responded to the LG’s tweet, and requested him to avoid direct meetings with officials of the Delhi government.“It is against the Constitution and the Supreme Court Constitution bench judgment to hold such parallel meetings behind the back of the elected government. We are a democracy. People have elected a council of ministers. If you have any questions, please ask your ministers. Avoid holding direct meetings with officers. Let’s respect democracy, sir,” the CM tweeted.Officials in the CM’s office said no ministers were asked to attend the meeting.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia questioned the LG’s authority to convene such a meeting.“Despite the Constitution and Supreme Court judgment, and by cornering the elected government, what kind of Covid-19 management is happening here? The LG nowhere has the right to call officers separately behind the chief minister’s back. Then in what capacity and with what objective was this meeting called?”Sisodia tweeted.The LG’s office did not respond to requests for comment.During the meeting, the LG expressed concerns over reported violation of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour in the Delhi Metro and other public transport. Accordingly, the divisional commissioner, Delhi Police and MD, DMRC were advised to ensure that Covid-19 protocols are strictly enforced, the LG office said.In a letter to Baijal on July 17, Sisodia alleged that over the past three months, the LG has been calling bureaucrats to his office, issuing directions and “putting pressure” on them to implement his orders. He termed it as a “murder of democracy” and “humbly requested” Baijal to desist from such “activities”. “Under the Constitution, the Delhi LG can take decisions only on police, land and public order,” Sisodia added.“Over the last few months, you have been calling prominent officials of the Delhi government to your office and issuing directions related to work of their departments. I have also come to know that you are also issuing directions to the officials on subjects that come under the purview of the elected government, without even keeping the ministers in the loop, and later officials of the L-G secretariat are pressuring the bureaucrats to implement such orders,” Sisodia said.On July 22, Baijal wrote back to Sisodia that he should not have made the letter public, and rather taken up concerns over administrative issues over a personal discussion. The LG shared details of meetings held by his office in the past three months – which involved issues such as Covid-19 management, implementation of public welfare schemes such as ‘One Nation, One Ration Card’, water supply and housing – adding that Sisodia’s letter did not specify any instance of “obstruction”, and accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government of looking at his efforts through a “biased lens”.He further said that some of the meetings with the chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana regarding shortage of water supply in Delhi were chaired on Kejriwal’s request.“Several complicated administrative issues involve multiple departments and it is needless to say that on matters of public importance the opinion of the elected government should be in favour of cooperation and harmony… It is unfortunate that my efforts with clean intent towards public welfare were seen through a biased lens and misinterpreted. In the end, I want to repeat that I shall continue fulfilling my constitutional responsibilities aimed at serving the people of Delhi,” said Baijal’s letter to Sisodia, written in Hindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-lieutenant-governor-s-covid-meet-sparks-fresh-row-with-state-govt-101628116847771.html
05-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Raju’s paratha corner||A poly bag filled with tomatoes and lemons is hanging from a tree trunk. Another bag has green chilli pickles. The air is smelling of pre-sliced onions and hot steaming parathas. Stall owner Raju is absent-mindedly stirring the matar (pea) dish inside a brass cauldron.This pavement landmark in south Delhi’s Panchsheel Park has been in existence continuously for 30 long years. “It has always been here, on this same spot,” asserts Raju in a low voice. His late father had founded it, after moving to Delhi from a village in Badayun, UP. He taught Raju how to make the matar subzi and paratha from scratch, including the pickles. The elder brother runs a similar stall in Khan Market.In his 40s, Raju is dressed formally in grey pants and a collared shirt with sleeves rolled up to the elbows. He is very slim; his arms are so thin that they have the flatness of a two-dimensional figure.It’s late morning and the Outer Ring Road is busy with speeding cars. A man appears at the stall and wordlessly sits under the tree. He seems to be a regular patron, for Raju starts making a fresh paratha for him without any prompt. A little plastic bag is filled with mashed potatoes “for those who want aloo paratha.”Now Raju lifts the handkerchief from the brass cauldron, and scoops out a ladle of matar in a bowl. The dish looks boringly bland, as if it had been boiled and left at that. “But it’s salted.” Raju lightly sprinkles some masalas on the serving portion, tosses in some chopped tomatoes and onions, squeezes half a lemon, sprinkles chopped dhaniya and hands the meal to the man sitting on his haunches.He now turns to face the road and, while staring at the passing cars, remarks that he gets both chhote (small) and bade (big) people as customers.What does he mean by chhote?“Those who are labourers and guards, and who work hard.”And bade?“Those who are educated, and live in big houses.”Raju considers himself in the former category, “because I don’t live in a big house, and I work very hard.”He prepares a new serving. This time the paratha is stuffed with mashed potatoes. It’s delicious and feels as light on the palate as the matar. The green chilli pickle is homey. Raju’s stall opens daily from 7am to 4pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-raju-s-paratha-corner-101628110889018.html

Police are taking action against those who are circulating it to instigate violence. An FIR under relevant sections of Unlawful Activities Prevention has been registered at Budgam police station,” police said in a tweet.However, many traders and shopkeepers in Srinagar, including those in and around the city centre, Lal Chowk, said they have been asked not to shut shops on Thursday. “Police on Tuesday told our market’s president that shops should remain open on Thursday. If someone fails to do so, he will be himself responsible for the consequences,” said a trader of the market opposite Kashmir Haat.He said that on Wednesday, police officials visited the market and reiterated that shops should be kept open on Thursday. “August 5 is a day when our special status was snatched away from us. Our conscience won’t allow us to open shops,” he said.Shopkeepers from Goni Khan and Maharaj Bazaar also reiterated the claims.On July 8, a spontaneous shutdown was observed in parts of Kashmir on the fifth death anniversary of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani. While separatists would call a strike on Wani’s anniversary but after the crackdown on them and revocation of J&K special status on August 5, 2019, there have been no calls from them for strike.The allegations come after a senior police officer had told a public gathering in north Kashmir recently that “peace has now returned to Kashmir and the shopkeepers should not down shutters on August 5 and 15”.Kashmir Chamber of Industries and Commerce president Sheikh Ashiq confirmed that traders have been getting calls from police. “I also came to know that there is some exercise going on though I didn’t get any call from the police personally. Traders called me saying that they have been called by the police. We are business people and we should not have been brought into this,” he said.Messages to director general of police Dilbag Singh and inspector general of police, Kashmir, Vijay Kumar elicited no response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cops-told-us-to-not-to-shut-shops-on-2-anniversary-of-abrogation-of-art-370-kashmir-traders-101628111568717.html

He said he was hoping that the opposition would hold a fruitful discussion today, but it didn’t happen.

Between July 1 and 10, the TPR stood at 0.46%, between July 11 and 20, it was at 0.28% and from July 21 and 31, the figure stood at 0.23%. The daily cases went below 100 after July 20 to a low of 63 on July 23 in the second wave.However, in the past 10 days, the UT has seen a slight increase in cases. The TPR from July 25 to August 03 has seen a slight increase of 0.24%. Over the last 10 days, the daily cases have been fluctuating between 100 and 160.Experts say the situation may remain like this for two to three weeks after which, the cases are expected to rise again as restrictions have been eased.“We are exactly at the position where we were in February when the first wave had ebbed. The daily cases will hover around 100, sometimes 20 up and sometimes 20 down and this will change after two-three weeks when the cases will again rise,” said Dr Owais H Dar, general secretary of Doctors Association of Kashmir.“As restrictions have been eased and everything is open, people are hardly wearing masks. The virus variants are also evolving. These will obviously contribute to the emergence of the third wave,” he said.The overall test positivity rate (TPR) in the month of July dropped to 0.32% while it had been 1.80% in June.In May, when the second Covid-19 wave peaked, the TPR was 8.77% with the month recording 1.14 lakh cases and 1,625 deaths.There has been a consistent increase in the average monthly number of tests in the past three months. The UT conducted 17.58 lakh tests in July – over 25 % more than June when 13.93 lakh tests were performed. On an average, 56,700 people were tested daily in July against 46,400 in June.Dr Owais said he is hopeful the third wave won’t be severe.“The one positive this time is that large part of our population is vaccinated. So we expect that the peak this time won’t be very high.

MARCOS commandos of Indian Navy were called in on Wednesday to intensify the searches in the deep waters of the Ranjit Sagar dam, around 30 kms from Pathankot. MARCOS is a special-forces unit of the Indian Navy, usually called in for conducting special operations. “Searches are on but there is no clue so far. Neither the wreckage nor the missing pilots have been traced as yet. The search operations were resumed on Wednesday morning. Marcos divers of the Indian Navy were called in from Delhi,” said Kathua district police chief SSP Ramesh Kotwal. The crash occurred on Tuesday morning around 10.30. Rescue operations were suspended at night. On Tuesday, the search parties had found some chopper skids, fuel tanks, stabiliser, helmets and the identity card of one of the two pilots. The Rudra helicopter, built at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), was carrying out a training sortie that involved low-level flying over the lake, said a second official. The helicopter belonged to the army’s Pathankot-based 254 ALH-WSI squadron, which earlier lost a Rudra chopper in January 2021. The depth of the crash site has been measured to be over 200-ft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/still-no-trace-of-missing-pilots-in-kathua-chopper-crash-101628110488896.html

Reality and perception on the ground is diametrically opposite to the make-believe assessments that do not take the point of view of people into consideration,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/august-5-is-seen-as-a-day-of-disempowerment-jkpc-101628110308620.html

The minister said climate change was affecting not just Himachal and India but the whole world. “Due to climate change, there is unseasonal rain, hailstorm and snowfall which have led to loss of lives and damage to property and crops. Earlier, cloudbursts were reported in very few areas, however, off late the phenomenon has become more frequent and it is hard to predict where it would occurr. Many reasons can be attributed to these extreme weather events -- deforestation, urbanisation, hydro projects and mining in the name of development,” said the minister. He said famers and horticulturists have suffered a loss ₹354 crore due to hailstorm this season and a report regarding this has been submitted to the centre. Thakur said farmers have also suffered losses due to drought-like situation in the last one-and-a half years while many drinking water supply schemes have dried up. He said the government is providing all possible help to people affected by flashfloods and other natural calamities. He said the chief minister has provided assistance of ₹10 crore for relief works after Batseri landslide incident of Kinnaur. He said schemes worth crores are expected to be approved soon for the Centre for disaster mitigation by channelisation of rivers and rivulets. Earlier, initiating the debate on resolution, Barsar MLA Inder Dutt Lakhanpal said the farmers of Himachal had suffered huge losses due to drought in summers and now the heavy rains have damaged their crops. Dharamshala legislator Vishal Nehria said heavy monsoon rains triggered floods in Dharamsala, causing loss of life and property. He demanded relief to the affected people and rehabilitation of the displaced.Balbir Veram said the orchards in Chaupal of Shimla have been washed away due to heavy rains. He said orchards can be saved by constructing check dams on water streams. Participating in the debate, legislator Jia Lal said many roads have been damaged in his constituency, Bharmour, due to rains and floods. He said electricity and water were also disrupted and 23 people died in rain-related incidents in his constituency. He demanded to expedite the work on restoration of bridges, roads, electricity and water supply schemes. Kinnaur MLA Jagat Singh Negi said the situation was bad in Lahaul-Spiti and people had to spend two days in a cave after the cloudburst. He questioned why the administration didn’t stop vehicular movement on the road at Batseri while rocks were already falling before the deadly landslide. He demanded an increase in the compensation amount for people affected by the disasters. Pawan Kajal raised the issue of damage caused by heavy rains in Kangra. He told that the water of Manjhi Khad caused great damage to the crops. A total of 11 members participated in the debate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rainrelated-mishaps-claimed-222-lives-in-hp-this-monsoon-101628109768778.html

The panel comprising cabinet ministers Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and MLAs Harminder Singh Gill, Kulbir Singh Zira and Kushaldeep Singh Kikki Dhillon had approached the morcha in December 2018, announcing that the government had accepted all their demands.

The panel members did not appear before him. In a two-page open letter to Mand, the committee members wrote, “Ensuring punishment to the culprits of the sacrilege and police firing incidents is the job of the state home department which is under the chief minister. Therefore, only he has full information of the progress in the case.” They added, “The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC), managements of Takht Patna Sahib and Takht Hazur Sahib and other elected Sikh bodies do not recognise you as the Akal Takht jathedar.

With this, around 50% of the target population in the state has been vaccinated at least with the first dose. State Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said, “We crossed the 1 crore mark on Monday. As per the state’s own assessment, we have nearly 2.4 crore beneficiaries aged above 18 who have to be vaccinated as per the present criteria.” However, the state continued to perform poorly on ensuring speedy and timely second dose for the beneficiaries as the data shows that only 25 lakh people have been vaccinated with both the doses. “Ideally, the figure of fully vaccinated people should have been at least 60 lakh by now. We are going slow on the second dose as we are focusing too much on the first jab which is exhausting most of the supply being received from Centre,” a senior official admitted. Following the Centre’s recent letter to the Punjab government, it was decided to consume 80% of the fresh supply for the second jab. But the district health authorities continued to focus more on the first dose. “Of the total first dose beneficiaries, 97 lakh were registered through the Union health ministry’s CoWIN app whereas the rests were registered on the state’s COVA application. And of the total administered doses, 88 lakh are of Covishield while 12.4 lakh are of Covaxin,” the nodal officer said. Nearly 14,000 doses of Sputnik-V have also been given in the state, he added. Punjab will get 22 lakh vaccine doses this month, according to an official communiqué received from the Centre. Last month, the state had got 21 lakh doses. “This month, we plan to use at least 16 lakh jabs for the second dose,” an official said. Among the districts, Ludhiana administered maximum 14.50 lakh doses followed by Jalandhar (9.66 lakh), Hoshiarpur (8.88 lakh), MOhali (7.79 lakh), and Amritsar (7.35 lakh). Mansa, Barnala, Faridkot, Fatehgarh Sahib, Fazilka districts are lagging behind in the vaccination drive. Also, nearly 55% of the vaccinated population is male and 45% female.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-crosses-1-crore-dose-mark-half-of-target-population-vaccinated-101628106592701.html

On Wednesday, Sikh Sadbhawna Dal head and former Golden Temple hazuri ragi Baldev Singh Wadala sent an 11-member jatha to the site to oppose the ongoing construction work through Heritage Street but police stopped them midway. They were apprehending that the structure declared as ‘historic’ by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) may be damaged due to the construction work being carried out by the Kar Sewa volunteers. But when 5-6 of the activists managed to reach the site to lodge their protest, the SGPC task force employees thrashed them. Turbans of the activists were also tossed in the melee. The SGPC employees also snatched and damaged the cameras and mobile phones of journalists covering the scuffle. A woman reporter of a web channel alleged that the SGPC men misbehaved with her and snatched her mobile phone and did not return it.When informed about the development, a group led by Wadala started marching towards the site but was stopped by the police. On this, they sat on a dharna there. “The administration assured us that the work will be stopped in view of the historic importance of the structure till final decision is not taken on its preservation. But the work is going on unabated. We will keep on sending our jathas till the work is not stopped,” said Wadala.“If the sangat (devotees) starts gathering at the site to oppose the ongoing construction and the situation turns out of control, the administration will be responsible,” he added.Also, Amritsar deputy commissioner Gurpreet Singh Khaira held a meeting with representatives of the Sikh Sadbhawna Dal to break the impasse, but to no avail. “The portion of the site where the structure was found is left untouched and the work is going on in the rest of the area. The heritage structure will not be damaged,” said Khaira.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/row-over-heritage-structure-sgpc-task-force-sikh-activists-clash-at-golden-temple-construction-site-101628106591520.html

The commissionerate police have booked notorious gangster Jagdeep Singh, alias Jaggu Bhagwanpuria, who is lodged in Delhi’s Tihar jail, his associates Jagroshan Singh and Money Rayya besides two unidentified persons in Kandowalia’s killing. The case was registered under sections 302 (murder) and 442 (house trespass) of the Indian Penal Code. Kandowalia, who was facing nearly 15 cases, including that of murder and attempt to murder, was out on bail since 2019 and even got married in the interim period. He hailed from Kandowalia village in Amritsar district’s Ajnala sub-division. The police said the assailants pumped six bullets into Kandowalia’s body night after barging into the hospital on Tuesday. During the firing, his close associate Tejbir Singh Teji, a leader of the Shiromani Akali Dal’s student wing Student Organisation of India (SOI), also received three bullet injuries, but his condition is stated to be stable. A hospital guard also sustained a bullet injury on his leg. The police said Tejbir also fired from his pistol, injuring one of the assailants who managed to escape. In the CCTV footage procured from the hospital, the assailants are seen fleeing from the hospital with Teji firing at them. FB post claims ‘responsibility’An unverified Facebook post on an account named after Bhagwanpuria claimed that the gangster and his “brother” got executed Kandowalia’s murder. The post claimed that one Mandeep Batala, also a history sheeter, killed Kandowalia at the instance of Bhagwanpuria for supporting gangsters Vicky Gounder and Devinder Bambiha in the past. Deputy commissioner of police (investigation) Mukhwinder Singh Bhullar said, “We are examining the authenticity of the post. So far, we have not booked Mandeep Batala and Goldy Brar in the case. According to the eyewitnesses, gangsters Jagroshan and Money Rayya were among the four persons who attacked Rana.”They will bring Bhagwanpuria on production warrant from the Tihar jail, the DCP said. Jagroshan and Money are facing seven and 12 criminal cases, including that of murder, attempt to murder and extortion. Also, Kandowalia was fired at by some unidentified persons after attending a hearing in a murder case in an Amritsar court in February last year, but escaped unhurt. The police had suspected Bhagwanpuria’s role in the attack. Kandowalia was one of the key accused in the 2016 Patti gang-war between the gangs led by Bobby Malhotra and Devinder that left gangster Dilbag Singh, alias Lama Patti dead. He had surrendered before the then special task force (STF) headed by then inspector general (IG) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh in February 2017. In April 2017, Rana’s close associate Sukhwinder Singh, alias Lala was shot dead by Bhagwanpuria’s associate Saraj Singh who was also involved in the killing of Vipan Sharma, a Hindu outfit leader, in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amritsar-hospital-firing-gangster-rana-kandowalia-succumbs-to-injuries-bhagwanpuria-aides-booked-101628106588250.html

She underlined her concern towards the imploding crisis, especially in the wake of prevailing economic condition which is forcing people to relocate to foreign lands to seek education or employment or to be with their families. “Allure of attaining a permanent residence in Canada has facilitated a few greedy people to take advantage of innocent Indian citizens and rob them of large amounts of money through contract marriages and marriage fraud,” the MP wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/preneet-urges-jaishankar-to-probe-check-contract-marriage-frauds-101628106047748.html

Rains, scorching heat or immense cold conditions, nothing can force us to retreat.” Union leaders Jhujar Singh Sangrur, Deepak Kamboj and Ranjit Singh Bhattiwal said that Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had in 2016 come to their protest site and promised that once his government comes to power, they will in the first cabinet meeting regularise the services of teachers. “But now, more than four years have passed but the Captain’s government has not lived up to its promises. So, we have decided to hold massive protests till anyone from the current dispensation comes and gives us assurance. We also demand that our lump sum salary be increased to ₹40,000,” they added.

We will not let the three black laws be implemented in Punjab. These central farm laws are a direct attack on the federal structure of India and against the spirit of the Constitution as agriculture is a state subject,” Sidhu said. He, along with cabinet ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Charanjit Singh Channi, visited the house of Ghanaur MLA Madan Lal Jalalpur. Later he addressed the media in Patiala. In his recent meeting with chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, Sidhu had underlined the need to reject the farm laws in the Vidhan Sabha as it was done in the case of Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal. “We will not settle for any amendment. Punjab needs to counter the Centre by coming up with its own laws,” Sidhu said. Sidhu’s visit to Jalalpur’s house comes days after local Congress leaders and workers held a protest rally against him. “I will come to Ghanaur whenever the local MLA needs me,” he said in a gesture of support to the local MLA. Randhawa slammed Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal for promising free electricity up to 400 units in Punjab. “The party will dissect Sukhbir’s promises with logic in the coming days. Why didn’t he give free electricity when his party was in power? Why were faulty power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-will-dare-centre-by-rejecting-3-farm-laws-sidhu-101628105754973.html
05-08-2021||Chandigarh||Zirakpur suffers in absence of stormwater drainage||Even though Zirakpur is a town with a population of nearly four lakh and at least 100 high-rise group housing societies along with 40 commercial establishments, it has no stormwater drainage system and is entirely dependent on choes and nullahs to drain out the excess rainwater.Every year during monsoons, residents of Zirakpur bear the brunt as they wade through waterlogged streets and drain out water from their shops and houses. The absence of a robust drainage system and dependency on natural drains is clearly pointed out in the Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority’s (PUDA’s) Zirakpur master plan for 2031. In several areas, however, these drains and choes have been encroached upon — another consequence of Zirakpur’s exponential and unplanned growth. “The town has witnessed 281.9% growth between 2001 and 2011 Census,” the master plan mentioned.A former executive engineer of the Zirakpur civic body said, “It is the result of haphazard construction and lack of rainwater drainage system. There is no separate arrangement for the disposal of rainwater. Excessive laying of paver blocks and incomplete construction work is also causing water to accumulate.”As per Girish Verma, executive officer of Zirakpur MC, the town is old and there is no stormwater drainage system. “It is a low-lying area, but we are working to fix the problem,” he added. ‘An island of chaos’Joint action committee president Sukhdev Chaudhary, who is leading a campaign against illegal colonies, said, “The township, which is considered the gateway to Punjab, is an island of chaos surrounded by planned cities of Chandigarh, Panchkula, and Mohali. Growth in the town has been haphazard with villages giving way to colonies, mostly illegal, and property dealers and realtors tapping into the need for modest housing for those less privileged.”As external and internal development charges, the civic body collects ₹1 crore per acre from the residential group housing societies and ₹1.35 crore from the commercial establishments. Harish Gupta, president of Zirakpur Builders Association, said Zirakpur’s civic body is considered one of the richest in Punjab and has around ₹200 crore with it to develop infrastructure. “But they completely failed to build a proper drainage system. The only area that is safe from waterlogging is a high-ground terrain and the rest of the town is settled in low-lying areas,” he added. On the poor management of rainwater drainage, MS Aujla, former director, Punjab local government’s town planning department, said it was not only the drainage, but the consideration of topography to allow natural passages for the flow of rainwater towards choes or nullahs. “The situation is further aggravated by the construction of roads crisscrossing the natural flow of water as per the terrain,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/zirakpur-suffers-in-absence-of-stormwater-drainage-101628105747930.html
05-08-2021||Chandigarh||Monsoon’s heaviest showers inundate Chandigarh roads||Normal life came to a standstill in parts of Chandigarh on Wednesday afternoon when showers lashed the city. In about two hours, 55.4mm rainfall was recorded in the city which, as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), was the highest received this monsoon season. Waterlogging affected the northern sectors along the Madhya Marg while a roundabout in Sector 17 was flooded and cars had to be towed out of there. President of the market association in Sector 22, Subhash Narang, said, “The drainage system here is rarely cleaned. As it rained so fast, the roads got flooded. Nobody was able to enter or leave the market around this time.”Chairperson of Chandigarh Residents Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED), Hitesh Puri, said, “We received complaints about blocked drains from multiple parts of the city. The authorities must take adequate steps to avoid waterlogging during monsoons.”As per the Chandigarh municipal corporation’s (MC’s) superintending engineer (public health) Shailender Singh, at least 15 teams were present on the spot to look after flooding issues. “Waterlogging happened because of incessant rainfall. We received calls from the areas adjoining the Madhya Marg besides sectors 22 and 30. It took our teams an hour to pump out the excess water,” he added. As per the IMD, downpour will continue in the coming days as well. IMD scientist Shivinder Singh said, “Showers are likely to lash daily, but will be scattered over the region. Chances of light to moderate rain up to 30mm are there for the next few days.”Maximum temperature of the city went up from Tuesday’s 31.4 degrees Celsius to 34.5 degrees on Wednesday. Minimum temperature went down from 26.9 degrees on Tuesday to 26.5 degrees on Wednesday. In the next three days, maximum temperature will hover between 34 degrees and 35 degrees, while the minimum temperature will remain between 26 degrees and 27 degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/monsoons-heaviest-showers-inundate-chandigarh-roads-101628105689336.html
05-08-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh government’s revenue collection goes up by ₹1980.43 crore in July||The Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday claimed a consistent increase in the state’s revenue with its collections going up by ₹1980.43 crore in July 2021, the first month of the second quarter of 2021-22.The state government’s revenue collections of ₹12655.85 crore are, however, only 74.1% of the target of ₹17,076.93 crore set for July 2021.“Yes, our collections are going up consistently. The state government realised revenue of ₹12,655.85 crore in July (2021-22) against ₹10,675.42 crore collected in the same month in 2020-21,” said minister for finance Suresh Khanna while releasing the statistics about revenue collections that took a dip in 2020-21 following restrictions due to the fight against Covid-19.The state government’s tax revenue increased by ₹ 2026.30 crore in July 2021-22 vis-à-vis the tax collections in July 2020-21. But the non-tax revenue in the mineral and mining sector went down by ₹ 45.87 crore during the same period. The government earned revenue of ₹178.54 crore in this sector in July 2020-21 but the amount declined to ₹132.67 crore in July 2021-22. Hence, the increase in overall revenue collections was reduced to ₹1980.43 crore in July 2021. Khanna did not give any specific reason for the decline in the non-tax revenue during the period. He said the revenue collections had consistently increased in the first four months of 2021-22 (April 1 to July 2021).The state government’s total tax collections from April 1 to July 31, 2021 (2021-22) remained about ₹42739.71 crore, 68.8% of the target of ₹ 62,137.00 crore for the same period. Its tax collections in the first four months are about 22.9% of the annual tax collection target of ₹ 1,86,345.00 crore for 2021-2022. The non-tax revenue collections in the first four months remained at ₹ 2065.25 crore, about 30.5% of the target of ₹ 8075.53 crore and 9.7% of the annual target of ₹ 25,421.67 crore.The state government spends about ₹12,000 crore to ₹13,000 crore every month on the payment of salaries to its employees and pension to its retired employees. The government’s total collections of ₹12655.85 crore in July may only be sufficient for the payment of salaries and pension and the state government may have to go for market borrowings in the coming months to fund development projects.Uttar Pradesh goes to assembly elections in the early 2022 and the state government will need more funds to complete or step up the pace of many important development projects.“An increase in the state government’s revenue vis-a-vis the collections of 2020-21 and consistent upward trends in the first four months of 2021-22 clearly indicates that Uttar Pradesh’s economy is gradually regaining its momentum. It also reflects the efforts to collect more revenue, which should put the state government in a comfortable position to undertake developmental activities at an accelerated pace. The increasing revenue gives more fiscal space to state government and reduces its compulsion to go for market borrowings. The state government, however, needs to be proactive in augmenting its non-tax revenue, especially in the mineral and mining sector, in the coming months,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor at the department of economics, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-s-revenue-collection-goes-up-by-1980-43-crore-in-july-101628105567656.html
05-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Congress: Rift widens as six Chhabra loyalists resign||Dissidence against the incumbent leadership in the Chandigarh Congress continues to brew as six more leaders resigned from the primary membership of the party on Wednesday. The development comes two days after the former general secretary, Sandeep Bhardwaj, had quit. Those who resigned are former general secretaries of District Congress Committee Jagdeep Mahajan, Rajneesh Bhardwaj and Charanjeet Sharma; former vice-presidents Dinesh Sharma and Beant Singh; and former secretary Harvinder Singh Goldy. All of them were considered loyal to party’s former city chief Pardeep Chhabra, who had been criticising the Congress leadership for “ignoring and sidelining” him and his loyalists. The phrasing of the resignation letters was same and all were addressed to Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. They all blamed “high handedness” of former party MP Pawan Kumar Bansal for their resignations. The disgruntled voices in the Congress have been growing ever since Chhabra was replaced by Subhash Chawla as the new city chief in February this year.However, the internal crisis deepened after Chawla announced his new executive committee. The 133 new office-bearers, alleged Chhabra, didn’t include his loyalists. He also claimed that the party made the appointments based on not merit but “money and sycophancy”. Chawla and Bansal are the main recipients of his criticism.The allegation has been strong refuted by Chawla, who has maintained that he has retained nearly 99% of Chhabra’s team in the new committee.Notably, the new Congress appointees are slated to meet on Thursday at the Congress Bhawan in Sector 35. Chawla has ensured that this time, Chhabra has been informed and invited to the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-congress-rift-widens-as-six-chhabra-loyalists-resign-101628105447445.html

05-08-2021||Mumbai||Reservation: Modi-led Centre trying to politicise quota issue, says Maharashtra government||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday termed the Central government’s plan to bring in an amendment clarifying that the power to give reservation to the socially and educationally backward classes is with the states “an attempt to politicise the issue”. The state government said that the Maratha reservation cannot be restored unless the Centre removes the 50% cap. The Supreme Court, in its order on Maratha reservation on May 5, had ruled that the 102nd constitutional amendment has taken away the state governments’ powers to give reservation to any community on the basis of backwardness. The Centre had moved a review petition over the SC order and said it did not mean to take away the powers. The apex court, however, had turned down the review petition. The Centre has now proposed to bring in an amendment to give clarity over the powers of the state. Ashok Chavan, public works department minister and head of the cabinet sub-committee on reservation, said that giving mere powers for the reservation to the state would not serve any purpose. “The decision could spread the wrong message among the community members that it would facilitate the restoration of the reservation, but until the 50% ceiling on reservation is not lifted, the state will not be able to decide on the reservation. While bringing in the amendment to give powers to the states, the Centre should also make constitutional changes to remove the ceiling,” he said. Chavan said the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government was trying to politicise the issue. “During our meeting with PM Modi on June 8, we had demanded the removal of the cap. Not just Maharashtra, even other states that have been fighting the legal battle for reservation had expressed similar sentiments, but the Centre has chosen to keep silent on it and now wants to shift the onus on the states,” he said. Reacting to the state government’s stand, leader of opposition in legislative council Pravin Darekar said the state should take necessary steps for restoration of the reservation without giving any excuse. “By deciding to give powers to states, the Centre has cleared its stand. Now it is time for the state government to give reservation beyond 50%. The central government has been very positive about the reservation to Marathas, but instead of doing its bit, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi has been pointing at the Centre just to get rid of its responsibility,” he said. Vinod Patil, a petitioner for the reservation to Marathas, said, “The Central government’s decision is a positive move towards the reservation. The state should take steps to restore reservation to the community by weeding out the objections taken by the apex court.” On May 5, the five-judge bench of the SC struck down the 12% and 13% reservation given to Maratha community in education and jobs under the SEBC Act, 2018. It ruled that it crossed the limit of 50% ceiling on reservation and the empirical data of the community collated by Gaikwad commission does not prove the backwardness and had also stated that after the 102nd constitutional amendment, states have no power to give any such reservation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/reservation-modi-led-centre-trying-to-politicise-quota-issue-says-maharashtra-government-101628105089090.html

05-08-2021||Chandigarh||Vegetable prices continue to rise in Chandigarh||As the prices of fuel continue to stay on the higher side, and with recent spells of rain in the region, the price of vegetables at the apni mandis continues to go up. The prices are likely to keep increasing till the end of the monsoon season.Tomatoes that had remained relatively cheaper throughout the season have now started to become expensive. Cauliflower, which was available for around ₹30 per kg in the summers, is now more than double that price.Speaking about the price hike, a mandi supervisor for the Punjab Mandi Board, Satbir Singh, said, “There are two main reasons behind the price hike. Since rains have damaged a lot of vegetables in both Punjab and Himachal, the supply has gone down. Further, transportation costs have also increased due to the high price of diesel. Prices will continue to stay high until the monsoon season gets over.”Singh added that many farmers had taken to growing their vegetables on nets so they don’t get spoiled in the rains; they also charge heftier prices for this. This has affected how people are purchasing vegetables now.Arvind Kumar of Sector 47 said that he was now more mindful of buying vegetables with the increasing prices: “Coriander, which is a staple in our diet, has also become expensive.”Meanwhile, the footfall at the mandis has gone back to normal as per the officials. Earlier both traders and customers were unwilling to come, the numbers have increased now as Covid cases have gone down in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vegetable-prices-continue-to-rise-in-chandigarh-101628104908497.html

Most excited was his grandmother Savitri Devi, who was teary-eyed after the win and said, “Chora bol ke gaya hai gold laake dega (Ravi has promised to win a gold medal in the Olympics). We have seen a tough time as a family and Monu (Ravi) has now brought good days for us.”The village has a population of around 15,000. Ravi, 23, son of a farmer, is the third Olympian to emerge from this village after Mahavir Singh (1980 Moscow, 1984 Los Angeles) and Amit Dahiya (2012 London).With the semi-final win, Ravi became the second Indian wrestler ever to enter the Olympics final after Sushil Kumar back in 2012 London Olympics.Ravi idolises Sushil and Yogeshwar Dutt. In fact Sushil and coach Satpal Singh have worked relentlessly on grooming Ravi at Chhatrasal Akhara in Delhi.“Sushil has played a big role in shaping up Ravi’s career. He was always bright as a young trainee and had the hunger to reach the top. I was not surprised with the way he played the semi-final bout. It is his natural game. He likes to attack. He was just himself and did not come under big-stage pressure. He is going to win the final and get India a gold,” said former wrestler Darshan Lal, who is now the vice-president of the Wrestling Federation of India.Ravi picked up the sport at six.Nahri village residents and people from adjoining villages reached Ravi’s house to congratulate his father Rakesh Dahiya.Recalling Ravi’s formative years, Rakesh said, “I enrolled him at Chhatrasal Akhara and before that he would just train at the farm land. Raj Pahalwan was training him at the village. Despite financial crunch, we sent him to Delhi.”“I used to travel for one hour everyday to give him milk and fruits which have been his diet for the last 10 years. Coach Satpal had identified his talent and had told me that he will make India proud,” he added.Wrestling runs in the Dahiya clan’s blood. His father used to wrestle in his youth but could not pursue it due to financial issues.Ravi’s father owns land which is less than an acre in the Nahri village. His younger brother Pankaj Dahiya could not come home but watched the bouts with his friends at the Chhatrasaal Stadium where he trains as a Greco-Roman wrestler.Ravi will be the fifth wrestler from India to win an Olympic medal after KD Jadhav (bronze in 1952), Sushil Kumar (bronze in 2008 and silver in 2012) and Yogeshwar Dutt (bronze in 2008) and Sakshi Malik (bronze in 2016).Ravi is a two-time Asian Championships gold medallist and a bronze medal winner at the World Championships in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ravi-has-promised-to-win-gold-says-wrestler-s-granny-101628104548035.html

05-08-2021||Lucknow||First anniversary of bhoomi pujan for Ram temple to be marked in Ayodhya today||The first anniversary of the Ram temple’s bhoomi pujan (groundbreaking ceremony) on Thursday is likely to be a low-key affair due to Covid-19 restrictions though special prayers would be offered and yajnas (oblations) organised on the occasion in Ayodhya after which devotees would get a special “poori, sabzi and kheer” as prasad (edibles offered to the deity and then given to the faithful).“Chief minister Yogi Adityanath would be there on the occasion to participate in a special puja. He will also offer a Ram naami (a cloth with Lord Ram’s name inscribed on it) and perform aarti at the temple,” Satyendra Das, the head priest of the Ayodhya temple, confirmed.“Ram Lalla (baby Ram) would don new clothes and special poori-sabzi and kheer prasad would be distributed among the devotees,” Das said.“The special prasad would be for all the devotees who turn up but if we run out of it, then devotees would be given fruits,” the head priest said.“We spent a lifetime waiting for the day when Ram Lalla would move out of the makeshift arrangement and get an abode befitting the Almighty. Naturally, grand celebrations were in order but the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust that is overseeing the temple construction would take a final call on the nature of celebrations,” the head priest said.“Nothing newsworthy,” said Champat Rai, the general secretary of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, when asked if any special programmes were lined up for Thursday on the completion of one year of the bhoomi pujan that was done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 5, 2020. “Oblations or yajna too would be organised, but the celebrations would be low-key,” said a saint. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who is spending the night at Gorakhnath temple in Gorakhpur of which he is also the head priest, would leave for Ayodhya by a helicopter at noon (Thursday), officials said.“After landing at the Ram Katha Park in Ayodhya, the chief minister would attend a government function at Vasudev Ghat to mark Anna Mahotsav before arriving at the Ram Janmbhoomi site for holding special prayers on the occasion,” a senior official privy to the chief minister’s plan said. After the prayers, the CM is expected to gather details about the temple construction and leave for Lucknow. Volunteers of the Bajrang Dal, too, have been advised to stay indoors, offering prayers and reciting Hanuman Chalisa (prayers glorifying Hanuman).“We may gather in small numbers at temples to chant Hanuman Chalisa (prayers for lord Hanuman) and offer special puja. The moment is big but due to Covid-19 concerns and government advisory, it would be best if the cadres offer prayers from their houses,” said Rakesh (he goes by one name), a senior functionary of the Bajrang Dal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/first-anniversary-of-bhoomi-pujan-for-ram-temple-to-be-marked-in-ayodhya-today-101628104428422.html

05-08-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Strike by Punbus contractual staffers leaves passengers harried||Chaos was the order of the day outside the Amar Shaheed Sukhdev Interstate Bus Terminal on Wednesday as contractual employees continued their strike for the second consecutive day.Seeking regularisation of jobs, members of the Punjab Roadways and Punbus Contractual Employees Union closed entry to the bus stand for two hours till 12pm, resulting in harassment to passengers. While bus operators continued operations outside the bus stand, passengers had a hard time finding the right bus, leading to delays.A passenger, Kulvir Singh said buses were available outside the bus stand, but no one knew which one to board for their respective destinations: “Inside the bus stand, counters are assigned for various stations and conductors also guide the passengers. But it was a nightmare today.” Standing their ground, the protesters threatened of a three-day strike from August 9.Union’s district Shamsher Singh said, “The employees have been struggling for regular jobs for a long time. The government had even assured to fulfil our demands during the last Assembly elections. But the promises have not turned into reality. If the government does not act soon, we will intensify our protest.”Bus stand station supervisor Kuljit Singh Sodhi said Punjab Roadways buses departed from outside with some delay. The bus stand was reopened after two hours and the buses left as per normal schedule, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianastrike-by-punbus-contractual-staffers-leaves-passengers-harried-101628104375819.html
05-08-2021||Chandigarh||Vocational labs paving road to jobs for govt schoolchildren in Ludhiana||The newly-constructed beauty and wellness and construction laboratories at Government Model Senior Secondary School, Cemetery Road, are helping students of Classes 9 to 12 learn through practical application and become job-ready. Such vocational laboratories have been set up at 23 government schools in the district under the National Skills Development Corporation. With offline classes underway, students are making full use of them now. The school’s beauty and wellness laboratory is equipped with proper chairs, mirrors and equipment used for beauty treatments such as for pedicure, manicure, hair spa, hair and skin treatment. “In this course, practical exposure is important along with theoretical knowledge. I am training students everyday and over 300 students of Classes 9 to 12 have opted for the course,” said Sarabjeet Kaur, vocational trainer at the school. Pallavi Kumari, a Class-12 student, said, “When I joined school on July 28, I was overjoyed to see the lab. I had opted for a beauty and wellness course as a vocational subject in Class 9, as this can be a good career option after I complete my studies.Now, I wait for the class everyday.”On the other hand, the construction lab gives students an understanding of components used for building, major building parts, construction equipment, tools and instruments. The walls of the laboratory are beautified with pictures of building material, common tools used in construction and instructions on steps are required to construct a building. School principal Taskin Aktar, said, “These laboratories help students get a clear idea about the subject as they spend most of their time learning about how to use equipment. This experience will help them in their careers as skill-based courses are in demand everywhere in the world.”The new lab developed for construction and infra development is a hit among the students at senior secondary school in Haibowal Khurd. Principal Kamaljit said, “We now have 225 students in the appeal and 237 of them have opted for construction. After the labs were developed this year, more students have opted for it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vocational-labs-paving-road-to-jobs-for-govt-schoolchildren-in-ludhiana-101628104368923.html

05-08-2021||Chandigarh||Covid: Chandigarh logs no new case for first time since outbreak||For the first time since the Covid-19 outbreak on March 18 last year, Chandigarh recorded zero fresh case on Wednesday, according to data available with the UT health department.The news is a big respite for the city residents and the authorities, who had been eagerly waiting for the day.With this, the daily positivity rate also stood at zero, as out of 1,498 tests conducted in the past 24 hours, none returned positive. The authorities have conducted 6,19,395 tests to date.Meanwhile, no death was reported for the fourth consecutive day. The UT has recorded 61,965 cases so far, of which only 31 remain active. While 61,123 patients have been cured and discharged, 811 persons have lost their lives. Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, Chandigarh, said: “Finally, the day is here. We had been waiting to see zero case for a long time now. It is a big relief for all of us.”Dr Kang said a lot of factors have played role in the decline in figures. “Sero survey shows that nearly 78% adults and 67% children have antibodies. This could be because of high exposure during the two waves and vaccination. As many as 91% people have got the first dose and 27% have been fully vaccinated.”Urging people to get vaccinated on priority, she said: “If every person gets vaccinated, then we will be on a much stronger footing.”Mohali, Panchkula see uptickEven as Chandigarh recorded no case on Wednesday, the neighbouring districts reported an uptick with seven people testing positive in Mohali and four in Panchkula. These were the highest single-day tallies for the two since July 25 and July 16, respectively. However, no death was reported.In Mohali district, three cases surfaced in Kharar, two in Dhakoli and one each in Mohali and Banur.

05-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Goenka Group set to take over power department||Kolkata-based industrial and services conglomerate RP-Sanjiv Goenka (RPSG) Group is all set to take over the Chandigarh electricity department. On Wednesday, the group’s flagship Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation (CESC)’s wholly-owned subsidiary Eminent Electricity Distribution (EED) quoted the highest bid for the department. “EED quoted a bid of around ₹871 crore against the reserve price of ₹175 crore,” said a senior UT official privy to the development. The next highest bid of ₹606 crore was made by Torrent Power (see box). EED was one of the seven companies in the race for taking over the department, others being Sterlite Power, ReNew Wing Energy, NTPC Electric Supply Company Limited, Adani Transmission Limited, Tata Power and Torrent Power. Originally, 21 companies had bought the request for proposal, but only these seven entered the bidding stage. On Tuesday, technical bids of all the seven companies were approved, following which the financial bids were opened on Wednesday.“The final bid report will now be submitted to the empowered committee on power privatisation headed by the UT adviser. After its approval, the report will be forwarded to the Union government. The Union cabinet will take the final decision. The entire process is likely to be finished within a short time,” said the official, who did not wish to be named. The decision to privatise the electricity department was taken on May 12, 2020, after directions from the Centre. The UT had committed to finish the process by the year-end but it got entangled in legal battles, as the UT Powermen Union approached the Punjab and Haryana high court against privatisation. The move also elicited criticism from resident welfare associations and opposition parties.The process was stayed by the high court twice. Most recently, on May 28, the HC had applied the brakes on privatisation, and even pulled up the administration for its “undue hurry” during a raging pandemic. On both occasions, the administration had approached the Supreme Court, which allowed the process to continue. The HC will be taking up the case again on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhgoenka-group-set-to-take-over-power-department-101628104129837.html
05-08-2021||Chandigarh||Clean drinking water supply in 99% of Haryana’s households: Centre||All rural households of Jind and Palwal in Haryana on Wednesday were connected with tap water supply under the flagship ‘Har Ghar Jal’ scheme, according to the Union Jal Shakti ministry.Now, all households in 21 of the 22 districts in Haryana have tap water supply. Mewat is the only district where nearly 82% families are currently connected with piped water supply.Every family of Mewat will have tap water connection by early September and Haryana will be the sixth state in country to have 100% households having domestic water connections, the ministry said in a release.“Considering the coordination with the central government and the speed at which Haryana government has functioned, it is expected that the target will be achieved as early as the last week of August or the first fortnight of September,” a ministry official said.Under the ‘Har Ghar Jal’ scheme, the Centre has set a target of providing 55-litre drinking water per person per day to all households.There are close to 31 lakh rural households in Haryana. In August 2019, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the ‘Har Ghar Jal’ scheme, only 17.6 lakh rural households (57%) in Haryana were getting drinking water from the tap. The remaining 43% families had to travel long distances to collect drinking water.Under the Jal Jeevan Mission, over 13 lakh families have been given connections in less than two years and 30.68 lakh rural households of the state have started getting clean drinking water from their taps, the officials said.No paucity of funds to meet target: ShekhawatUnion Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said Haryana will not face any problem of funds in providing water connection to every household under the mission.“In the current financial year, about ₹1,120 crore have been allocated for this scheme,” he said.The amount is more than seven times against the ₹150 crore allocation of 2019-2020 and about four times more against the ₹290 crore allocation of 2020-2021.“In the current financial year, about ₹257 crore have been released by the central government to the state,” the minister said.‘6,638 villages, every school, anganwadi getting tap water’The ministry said 6,045 village panchayats and 6,638 villages have secured the distinction of becoming ‘Har Ghar Jal Saon’ in Haryana.Similarly, all 12,988 schools and 21,789 anganwadis in Haryana are now connected with piped water supply system.There is a provision of rainwater harvesting in 366 schools and gray water reuse in 1,233 in the northern state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/clean-drinking-water-supply-in-99-of-haryana-s-households-centre-101628104128011.html

05-08-2021||Noida||GB Nagar: Residents, realtors oppose proposed circle rate hike||A day after the Gautam Budh Nagar stamp and registration department proposed a steep hike in existing circle rates--on the basis of which a buyer pays stamp fee at the time of registering a property in his name,--objections started pouring in from stakeholders in large numbers even as experts in the realty sector called the increase ‘ill-timed.’ If the proposal floated by the stamp and registration department is accepted, buyers will have to cough up more money to buy property in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway. So far, dozens of social groups, such as Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations (NOFAA), an umbrella body of at least 70 housing societies, federation of apartment owners of Noida and Greater Noida, Progressive community foundation, federation of Noida RWAs and Gautam Budh Nagar district development RWAs, have filed objections. The National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO), Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI), and many other developers have also filed their objections against the hike in circle rates. “The proposal to raise circle rates in Noida, Greater Noida and along the Yamuna Expressway by as much as 40% and additionally apply a 5-12.5% surcharge on properties along the Metro route or near the expressway could not have come at a less ideal time. The NCR’s real estate market has only just begun recovering from the impact of two lockdowns. At this point of time, a softer pricing regime would have encouraged more buyers as they are still grappling with the financial hurdles brought along by the Covid-19 outbreak. Currently, it is in the proposal stage and we hope the authorities reconsider this ill-timed move,” said Anuj Puri, chairperson of Anarock Property Consultants.Rajiva Singh, president of Noida federation of apartment owners associations (NOFAA) , said the government should reject this proposal immediately. “The realty market has witnessed 30-40% reduction in property rates due to the economic crisis in view of Covid-19. The government should instead reduce the circle rates to give a boost to economy,” said Singh after filing the objection.Developers said that it is high time that circle rates be reduced and made more realistic.“Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra governments have reduced circle rates in view of Covid-19 pandemic. The UP government should take similar steps o revive the market. Also, the government should reduce stamp fee from 6% to 2% as it will benefit consumers, thereby benefiting the state government,” said R K Arora, chairman of NAREDCO.UP stamp and registration department’s assistant inspector general  S S Pal, UP’s stamp and registration department’s assistant inspector general, said, “We have not yet figured out how many objections have been filed so far. It will be done on August 16 and an appropriate decision will be taken in this regard.”In Noida’s A-category sectors 14A, 15A and 44, the circle rate is proposed at ₹1,94,250 per square metre (sqm) against the existing ₹1,03,500 per sqm — an 87% hike. In B-category sectors such as sectors 11, 12, 22, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77 and 78, which are hubs of middle-income group housing complexes, the rate is proposed at ₹72,000 per sqm against the existing ₹52,500 per sqm — a 37% increase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-residents-realtors-oppose-proposed-circle-rate-hike-101628103707307.html

05-08-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad municipal corporation to hire agency for collection of e-waste from households||Residents in the city will soon be able to dispose of their electronic waste in an environment friendly way and even get some value back as the Ghaziabad municipal corporation has decided to hire an agency for collection and transportation of e-waste for disposal in a scientific manner. The corporation officials said that a framework will be put in place in one and half months and they will soon be floating an expression of interest (EOI) to hire a firm for the purpose. E-waste includes old discarded electronic items such as television sets, refrigerators, cellphones, laptops, and chargers, among others.According to the officials, the city at present has no mechanism to collect e-waste that generally finds way to local scrap retailers and causes environment pollution as it is often burnt to extract metals such as lead, zinc, and nickel. “We will authorise a vendor for collection of e-waste from households. An EOI (to select a vendor) will be floated soon. The vendor will be paying up to the consumers and some amount will also be received by the corporation. For the purpose, we will be tapping the extended producers’ responsibility (EPR) mechanism,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. EPR refers to responsibility for management of the disposal of products by producers once those products are no longer in use by the consumers. “We will also come up with a control room and an app for the purpose. Residents can call the collection agency for collection and transportation of e-waste from households,” Tanwar added. The corporation officials, however, declined to give an estimate of the quantum of annual e-waste generation in the city. Another official familiar with the development said that disposal of e-waste by scrap dealers is generally prevalent in places like Loni bordering Delhi. “The unscientific disposal of e-waste takes place in Loni. Such an activity is prevalent in areas where the border is difficult to ascertain and operated in households and even in illegally setup factories,” the officer said, requesting anonymity. However, officials of the UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) said that the activities of unscientific disposal of e-waste have been curbed to a large extent in Loni. “During the past one and half years, there has been a crackdown on about 600 such units in Loni and they have been shut down. We have 21 authorised recyclers of e-waste in Ghaziabad and Hapur. At present, we do not have estimates about generation of e-waste in the city,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB.Environmentalists said that the city has no mechanism at present for collection of e-waste items. “Mostly, the households give away the old electronic items to local scrap vendors. Later, the waste finds its way to locations where they are generally burnt to extract metals and the leftover chemicals are also drained to ground. This severely impacts environment,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-municipal-corporation-to-hire-agency-for-collection-of-e-waste-from-households-101628103650100.html

Between July 24 and July 31, no such traveller was traced by the department. “The surveillance teams of district health department are collecting data from various sources that include nigrani samitis and residential bodies,” said Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma, chief medical officer, GB Nagar. The measures have been taken to prevent a possible third wave of Covid-19, he added.The health department is relying on 600 surveillance teams comprising ASHA and Anganwadi workers. “We have also alerted big hotels in the district to inform us if they get any passenger from the high-risk states,” said a health official.Now, the health department will also add an option for self-notification of travellers on the Integrated Command Control Centre helpline (18004192211) of the district. “A passenger from one of the high-risk states who wants to notify himself to the district health department can call on the ICCC helpline from Thursday,” said the official.Dr NK Sharma, president of Indian Medical Association (Noida chapter), said that precautionary measures will go a long way in fight against Covid-19. “It is a tough task ahead for the surveillance teams as the district does not have any interstate bus or train terminal, nor any domestic airport. We hope citizens will be vigilant and will report such travellers to the health department,” he said.Meanwhile, GB Nagar on Wednesday reported just one new Covid-19 case, according to the state’s health bulletin. The state has 686 active cases with 27 in GB Nagar, showed the data.Travellers from high-risk states including Kerala, Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, and Sikkim are under surveillance since August 1. As per the government order, every week, the list of high-risk states will be updated on the official website -- http://dgmhup.gov.in -- of director general (medical health), UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/27-travellers-from-high-risk-states-traced-in-gb-nagar-no-one-found-positive-so-far-101628103526181.html
05-08-2021||Noida||Noida: 59.23% children have Covid antibodies, finds ICMR study||The results of the serological survey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), that was released last week, have revealed that 59.23% children in the age group of 6-18 years in Gautam Budh Nagar have developed antibodies against Covid-19.The nationwide survey took place between June and July this year. Ten teams comprising members from the ICMR’s National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR) and the district health department collected 400 blood samples from Gautam Budh Nagar between June 29-30 this year. According to the national level figures released by the medical body on July 25, 28,975 people were tested, of whom 67.6% tested positive for the Covid antibodies.“Sero positivity means that the individuals have been exposed to Covid-19 in the past and have developed antibodies to fight the virus. However, having antibodies doesn’t mean that the person was symptomatic, nor does it mean that the person will be immune to the infection in future. Considering the lack of information at the national level, there was a need to generate evidence on SARS-CoV-2 infection among the population, more so in light of the ongoing planning and prioritization for the vaccination,” said Dr Shalini Singh, director of ICMR-NICPR. In Gautam Budh Nagar, the results found that 66.7% of the of 400 samples collected have the antibodies against Covid-19. GB Nagar was one of the 70 districts across India that was chosen for the survey. “As many as 130 samples of children below 18 years and 270 samples of adults were taken. An additional 100 samples of healthcare workers working at Sector 30’s district hospital was also taken,” said Dr Amit Kumar, district public health expert. Now, an analysis of the data reveals that 77 (59.23%) of the 130 children have Covid antibodies. Of the 130 samples, 40 were of children between the age of six and nine--22 (55%) of which tested positive in the sero survey. Fifty-five (38%) of the 90 children between the age of 10-18 years, whose samples were collected, have developed antibodies. According to the national data, seroprevalence among children of 6-9 years is 57.2% while it is 61.6% for those between 10-18 years. According to the survey’s findings, “More than half of the children (six to less than 18 years) were seropositive.”According to infectious diseases expert Dr Ishwar Gilada, the seropositivity among children is lesser than that of the general population, which is all the more reason to expedite their vaccinations in the country.“The Union health ministry is working towards starting vaccination of children. The trials are still underway and vaccination of children is likely to start by September this year. As per the data in sero-survey, seropositivity among children between 6-18 years old is less than that of general population which is between 66 to 67%. As schools are about to start, it is all the more important to inoculate children,” said Dr Gilada, who is also the secretary-general of Organised Medicines Academic Guild.When asked, chief medical officer Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma said, “I am yet to see the data of the GB Nagar serosurvey. Once I have assessed it, the health department will strategise its public health response”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-59-23-children-have-covid-antibodies-finds-icmr-study-101628103466127.html
05-08-2021||Delhi||Launch of Delhi Metro Grey Line extension pushed back over delays in restoring approach road||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Wednesday postponed the inauguration of the extension of the Dwarka-Najafgarh Grey Line to Dhansa Bus Stand, “for about two weeks’ time” as the officials wait for the restoration of an approach road that caved-in more than two months ago. The inauguration of the missing link of the Pink Line, connecting Mayur Vihar Pocket-1 and Trilokpuri, will however be inaugurated on Friday, as per the original plan announced on Sunday.“A portion of a vital road link connecting Khaira Mor with Gopal Nagar had to be blocked for heavy vehicles due to construction work on the reversal facility beyond the Dhansa Bus Stand station. However, following the completion of tunnelling work in the reversal area, the road is now being restored and will be ready soon which will facilitate easy access to the station from various interior areas beyond Najafgarh,” said a statement issued by DMRC.On May 20, a portion of the road near the then under construction Dhansa Bus Stand Metro station caved in after a spell of heavy rainfall, following which Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot inspected the area the next day and directed an inquiry.On Sunday, DMRC said that the extension of the Grey Line and the missing link of Pink Line will be inaugurated on August 6. Senior Metro officials said the Pink Line section will be inaugurated by Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday.The Metro said the date of inauguration of the Najafgarh–Dhansa Bus Stand metro extension “will be intimated shortly following the completion of this pending work”.In a letter to Mangu Singh, managing director of the Metro body, on Monday, Gahlot said, “Due to the construction of the Dhansa Bus Stand Metro Station and laying of the underground tunnel up to Khaira Mor, the stretch of Dhansa Road from Najafgarh Phirni up to Gopal Nagar has been blocked for more than one year... I fail to understand what purpose the inauguration will serve if common citizens are unable to reach the station due to blocking of the said road...”Gahlot also highlighted that DMRC has been submitting different timelines for completion of work, adding that “the assured timelines were never met and the said stretch of road has not yet been opened for normal traffic”.DMRC officials did not respond to queries seeking comment on the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dmrc-postpones-inauguration-of-grey-line-extension-101628103346707.html
05-08-2021||Delhi||‘The men told us to go home and sleep... But I couldn’t keep quiet’: Mother of 9-year old rape victim||For the nine-year-old Dalit girl, whose alleged rape and murder touched off angry protests, her mother was her best friend.Residents of Purani Nangal village remember the young girl as fiercely protective of her mother, tagging with her everywhere as the older woman collected garbage. She would sit around, talk or sing and come back to their airless one-room house at 5pm every day.“If she saw anyone misbehaving with me, she would quickly retort to silence the abuser. In return, all she wanted from me was to tie her hair into a nice plait,” the mother recollected.She was the only child of the couple, who belong to the impoverished Valmiki caste and made their living by picking off scraps and rags and begging near a local Muslim shrine.Stories of rape and molestation from across the city often echoed in the neighbourhood, spooking the mother who refused to let her daughter out of sight.Neighbours often insisted that the girl be sent to school, but the mother would cite safety concerns. Still, during the past year, she was slowly convinced of the benefits of education. “Finally, during the lockdown, the mother decided that when schools open, she would send her to study,” said a neighbour, Geeta Devi.That was not to be.As dusk fell on Sunday, the girl’s dead body were found at a local crematorium. A local priest, and three of his associates, claimed the girl was electrocuted while using a water cooler but the girl’s family alleged she was raped and forcibly burnt to erase evidence. The priests and others even advised the mother to bury the news and ward off scandal.“They told us to go home and sleep and not mourn the death. They said if we called the police, they would steal her organs. But I couldn’t keep quiet, so the moment I got back, I screamed at the top of my lungs…my girl was gone,” said the mother.Talking to the girl’s parents, police and other investigating officials, eyewitnesses and local villagers present at the spot, HT recreates how the tragedy occurred.2Around 5.30pm on Sunday, the mother suddenly felt ill.She asked her daughter to fetch water in a bottle. The girl strolled into the crematorium with an empty bottle in her hand. The woman started walking back home. Her husband had left for the market.The couple had no immediate reason to suspect trouble. The crematorium – which faced the shrine where the woman often sought alms -- was one of the few places she let her daughter alone. A water cooler in the crematorium premises was a big draw for the mother and daughter on hot, dusty days. The family was no stranger to the crematorium staff either. “The pandit ji (accused crematorium priest Radhe Shyam) would sometimes ask my daughter to make tea or bring him water,” the mother said.The couple was sometimes called also to clean the premises or move piles of wood. “He would give my daughter ₹5-10, but never paid me a penny for my hard work,” the mother said.Local residents knew the 55-year-old priest for years because his father presided over the crematorium before him.“Until then there was no way to know what the pandit ji had in mind,” the girl’s father said.3About 30 minutes later, when the mother returned, her daughter wasn’t around. Instead, it was priest, Radhe Shyam, looking out for her.The woman said – and the case FIR corroborated – that Shyam walked her into the crematorium and told her that the daughter died of electrocution from touching water cooler. “I saw my daughter on a bench. Her hands and feet were stretched out. Her eyes were closed, her lips were blackish, her nose was bleeding and water was oozing out of her mouth. But there was no mud or dirt on her clothes,” the mother recollected.She alleged four men were present: Shyam, Kuldeep Kumar, 63, Laxmi Narayan, 48, and Mohammad Salim, 49.Shyam rode out on his scooter to find the girl’s father. “He picked me from the market, but revealed about the death only when we were on the flyover near the crematorium,” the father said.By 7.30pm, the pyre was on fire -- all religious cremation formalities sidestepped.“But a mother’s heart couldn’t accept this wrong and she decided to call the villagers. Each time my wife and I tried to run away, they would drag us back in. They kept the crematorium’s gates locked until the pyre was fully burning,” the father alleged.The woman said they were eventually allowed to leave a little before 9pm. “They offered to feed us before leaving, but I refused. They said that if we did not let anyone know about the cremation, they would help us perform the last rites in the Yamuna,” the mother said.The woman’s neighbours remember her running towards them around 9pm, screaming that her daughter was killed. Soon, dozens of residents were outside the crematorium, knocking down the gates. The funeral pyre was raging by then. “Only the legs were not burnt,” said Ajit Kumar, a local resident.A statement by Ingit Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner of police (south-west) said that a call to the police control room (PCR) was made at 10.30pm.4Kumar said many residents were enraged and thrashed the four suspects. “One of them confessed and then blamed Radhe Shyam for planning everything,” said Kumar.The four suspects were eventually rescued by the police.The DCP’s first statement said that the PCR call was about “rape and death of a minor girl and her being cremated”, but neither rape nor murder was mentioned in the FIR registered at Delhi Cantonment police station.On the issue of the FIR not mentioning rape, the DCP said that such cases are not registered based on the allegations made by the PCR caller. “The girl’s mother did not mention rape and murder in her statement for the FIR, or even in her statement the next day under CRPC section 164,” the officer said. The mother disputed this.On Monday evening, police added sections of rape, murder, Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) and the SC/ST Act after the mother’s statement was recorded before the SC/ST Commission.The post-mortem of the victim’s body by a medical board comprising three doctors from Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital came back inconclusive on Wednesday because only her charred remains were recovered.“The autopsy was inconclusive and no cause of death has been ascertained since very few body parts were available,” the DCP said.5Back at the village, there is a clear divide. Many of the victim’s neighbours and members of the Valmiki community are galvanized in their demand for justice. Many have mobilised activists, called reporters and recorded every statement since Sunday night.Others – especially on the upper-caste dominated section of the 7,000 strong village – see this as a political conspiracy to whittle their power.Among them is the family of one of the arrested, Laxmi Narayan.Narayan’s wife, Kiran Devi, said her husband was not an employee at the crematorium. “He is a painter who returned from work, handed me a part of his daily wage, and then went out for a shave. Since the saloon was crowded, he strolled out to find a gathering. He was a part of the crowd, but some local residents jealous of him framed him in this case,” said Devi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/they-asked-us-to-go-home-and-sleep-and-not-mourn-the-death-101628103107807.html
05-08-2021||Lucknow||Ex-BSP MLA arrested for arson at Rita Bahugana Joshi’s house in 2009 joins BJP||Former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) lawmaker Jitendra Singh Babloo, who was arrested in 2009 in connection with alleged arson at the then Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi’s Lucknow residence, was inducted into the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), along with leaders from various other political parties, in the state capital on Wednesday. Rita Bahuguna Joshi, too, is in the BJP now and currently an MP from Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh.In a video statement released from Delhi, Joshi said, “In July 2009, when my house was targeted and burnt, Babloo was leading the arsonists. The charges against him have been framed. I am sure that he joined the party after hiding facts (about his alleged involvement in arson).” She said that she would appeal to BJP national chief JP Nadda as well as state BJP president Swatantra Dev to cancel Babloo’s joining.“The BJP’s doors are open for all but Babloo surely must have joined the party by hiding facts,” she said. Joshi is in Delhi, attending the monsoon session of Parliament.When the alleged incident of arson took place at her Lucknow residence in 2009, Joshi was lodged in the Moradabad jail for allegedly making defamatory remarks against the then Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati This is the second allegedly controversial appointment made in the BJP after that of Arvind Tripathi as the state secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth wing of the party. People familiar with the issue said Tripathi had 16 cases registered against him at Kanpur’s Kakadev police station. Tripathi and BJYM chief Pranshu Dutt Dwivedi, however, claimed that the cases were political and that Tripathi had been exonerated in most of them. In the latest development, Babloo, who had represented the Bikapur assembly constituency of Faizabad (now renamed Ayodhya) was inducted along with other leaders into the BJP in the presence of senior leaders. He was not only named in the arson case that took place in Lucknow on the night of July 15, 2009, but also subsequently arrested by the CB-CID. Joshi’s house in the high security Lucknow area was allegedly targeted by BSP leaders following her alleged remarks against BSP chief Mayawati, who was the Uttar Pradesh chief minister at the time. Babloo claimed he was innocent. “I had no role in the arson case. In fact, this is one of the reasons why I fell out with Mayawatiji. I was arrested in the case despite the fact that I had no role in the case,” he said. Asked how he felt being in the same party with Joshi, he said, “She is a senior leader and there is no question of any bad blood (on the arson issue).”The Congress took potshots at the development. “Now, the accused and the victim are both with the BJP. It is for the BJP to decide whom it wants to induct into the party, but people surely are watching as to the kind of appointments being made by a party, the leaders of which love to take the moral high ground on various issues,” said Congress spokesperson Anshu Awasthi. Other leaders inducted into the BJP include former Congress general secretary Pankaj Mohan Sonker, who had also contested the Lok Sabha polls from Azamgarh, former BSP coordinator from Ghaziabad Manoj Sharma and former BSP candidate from Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat Pravesh Singh.Agra-based social activist Dr Beena Lavanya also joined the BJP. Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Swatantra Dev welcomed the leaders into the party.“Now, as I welcome you into the party, it is your responsibility to embrace the policies and ideology of the party and take the various initiatives of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s government to the masses,” he said. The UP BJP chief also named DP Bharti from Badaun as the party’s state unit secretary. He appointed Ram Chandra Kannaujia from Lucknow as the state chief of the party’s scheduled caste (SC) cell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/former-bsp-mla-who-was-arrested-in-arson-case-in-2009-joins-bjp-in-uttar-pradesh-101628103106649.html

In June this year, Khaira joined the Congress.Khaira has invited disqualification on the ground of 10th schedule of Constitution of India. As per 10th schedule, a member of the House belonging to a particular party would be liable to be disqualified if he voluntarily gives up his membership of such a political party from which he is elected, the plea had argued.The high court bench of justice Deepak Sibal disposed of the plea taking note of the submissions from the state’s additional advocate general HS Sitta that as communicated a decision on the representation of Harsimran Singh will be taken within three months by the Speaker’s office.Last week, too, the high court had disposed of a plea in which directions were sought to the speaker to disqualify six MLAs, including Khaira, who won on the AAP ticket in 2017, but later left the party.Last week, too, the high court had disposed of a plea in which directions were sought to the speaker to disqualify six MLAs, including Khaira, who won on the AAP ticket in 2017, but later left the party.

05-08-2021||Delhi||Guards’ role under lens after gangster found dead in Tihar jail||An alleged gangster, Ankit Gujjar, was found dead in a cell inside Tihar jail No 3 on Wednesday morning, even as his two cell mates complained that they were assaulted by the prison guards, officers aware of the matter said.Until his arrest in August 2020, Gujjar,29, was one of western Uttar Pradesh’s most wanted persons. Accused in at least eight murder cases, along with other criminal cases, Gujjar carried a reward of ₹1.25 lakh at the time of his arrest --- ₹1 lakh announced by Uttar Pradesh police and ₹25,000 by Delhi Police.Delhi Police and Tihar prison officers did not elaborate on the events that led to Gujjar’s death, but Tihar director general, Sandeep Goel, said a magisterial inquiry is being conducted in the matter.HT spoke to several police and prison officers who confirmed that on Tuesday, three inmates, including Gujjar, fought with prison guards during an inspection of their cell. The inspection was conducted following a tip-off that the prisoners were hiding an “improvised sharp weapon” in their cell, the officers said.“Gujjar was lodged in a cell with two other prisoners Gurpreet, 22, and Gurjeet, 22, both residents of Delhi’s Dakshinpuri. Jail officers conducted a search inside their cell, but they resisted. During the search, the three appeared to have clashed with the prison guards. After this, the situation was brought under control and Gujjar was transferred to a solitary cell. Gurpreet and Gujjar were lodged together in another cell,” said an officer, who asked not to be named.At 7am on Wednesday, when jail officers were taking a head count of the prisoners, they found Gujjar unconscious inside his cell. He was rushed to the dispensary of jail number 3, where he was declared brought dead. His two cell mates, who also alleged that they suffered internal injuries, were taken to the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, where they are currently under treatment.“It is possible that Gujjar may have suffered internal injuries. Only the post-mortem report will clear what led to his death,” a police officer, who asked not be named, said.Delhi police officers said they were awaiting a post-mortem report before proceeding in the matter.Gujjar, a resident of Baghpat, was arrested by UP Police in 2015. He was released on bail in 2019. He then shifted his operations to Delhi.Delhi Police said Gujjar joined hands with Delhi-based gangster Rohit Chaudhary, and together they formed the Chaudhary-Gujjar gang. There are several fan pages of Gujjar on social media with his photographs and videos. The photos show him carrying weapons. He has been addressed as a “top gangster” in many of the fan pages. In July 2019, Gujjar killed a local Bharatiya Janata Party leader, Vinod Pandit, during the panchayat elections in Chandi Nagar, Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh. He also pasted posters threatening his rivals.Last month, the Delhi high court asked the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe an inmate’s murder inside the jail in May. Delhi Police arrested four prisoners, lodged inside the jail for the murder. But the family of the dead prisoner, Srikant Swami, has also held jail officers responsible for his murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-guards-role-under-lens-after-gangster-found-dead-in-tihar-jail-101628102747034.html

Many shop owners in the city who kept open their shops past 4pm drew action from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Pune Police.“As we had already declared our plans, we remained open after 4pm. The state government needs to understand our survival. Thousands of small and big shop owners and traders are struggling and there is hardly any business. We will now keep our shops open till 7pm. Policemen came and started threatening us with action. PMC officials were also fining shop owners, but we are ready to face the action and won’t stop from running till 7pm,” said Fatechand Ranka, president, FTAP. “The state government has opened up 25 districts, which includes Mumbai and Thane. Then what is the fault of the Punekar traders. They should not combine Pune city and Pune district. Our only demand is that our shop timings should be extended till 7pm and we will get some time to do business,” added Ranka.At around 5 pm the PMC officials along with the police officers and policemen started taking rounds of the city, photographing shops which were open and taking down the names of shop owners. PMC officials fined some of shop keepers.Shop owner Rohan Nalawade from Navi peth said, “There are already so many restrictions due to Covid. Limited shop timings are adding to the daily life problems of shop owners and even citizens. If the situation goes on like this, I will have to close my shop soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shops-stay-open-till-7pm-police-pmc-begin-to-take-action-101628102505843.html

The reason: A chemical analysis of the drug seized revealed that it contained flower buds along with pieces of stalks, stems, leaves and seeds whereas Section 2(b) of The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, defines ganja as “the flowering or fruiting tops of the cannabis plant (excluding the seeds and leaves when not accompanied by the tops), by whatever name they may be known or designated”.The arrested accused, one Haribhau Mahadu Valse, was arrested by officials of Manchar police station on August 1, 2017 for storing ganja in his warehouse allegedly for the purpose of sale, according to the FIR lodged in the case under Section 8(c) and 20(c) of the NDPS Act. As the drug packed in gunny bags seized from Valse’s warehouse weighed over 51.4kg and anything over 20kg is considered a commercial quantity according to Valse’s lawyer advocate Ganesh Gupta, Valse was booked under the more incriminating Section 20(c) for being in possession of a commercial quantity of the drug, the punishment for which is more than 10 years’ imprisonment and/or a fine upon conviction which makes it difficult to get bail. By contrast, the punishment for being caught in possession of a small quantity of ganja (anything under 1,000 gram) is less stringent.On August 1, 2017, the police seized the ganja packed in gunny bags from Valse’s warehouse and got it verified by the panch while his co-accused escaped into a pomegranate field in which the warehouse was located. Ten days after seizure of the drug, it was sent for chemical analysis to ascertain whether it was ganja or not. The material packed inside the gunny bags was found to weigh over 51.4kg but it was also found to contain pieces of stalks, stems, leaves and seeds along with flower buds. While the ganja seized qualified as a commercial quantity by weight, the presence of stalks, stems, leaves and seeds went against the legal definition of the drug.Accordingly, the order passed by Justice Anuja Prabhudessai of the Bombay HC on July 29 and uploaded on August 2, read, “It is however to be noted that the chemical analysis report reveals that the material forwarded for analysis contained flower buds with pieces of stalks, stems, leaves and seeds, without quantifying the weight of the flower tops. This fact prima facie raises a doubt whether the ganja seized from the warehouse of the accused was of commercial quantity as to attract the provisions under Section 20(c) of the NDPS Act.”Valse was thus granted bail on a bail bond of Rs40,000 and at least one surety of the same amount and regular police station attendance. S V Gavand was the public prosecutor in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/stems-stalks-seeds-of-cannabis-not-ganja-bombay-hc-grants-bail-to-man-caught-for-possession-101628102446497.html
05-08-2021||Other||Online theft cases using remote access apps on the rise||PUNE: An increasing number of people are falling prey to online theft using screen-sharing applications that allow remote access to mobile and computer devices.The two screen-sharing applications most widely used by fraudsters to steal money from people online are AnyDesk and Teamviewer Quicksupport, according to officials of the cybercrime cell of Pune city police. These applications can be used by the same person for multiple personal devices owned or for remotely accessing other appliances including mobile phones, laptops and desktops.According to Vidya Jadhav, police inspector of Unit 2 of the cybercrime cell of Pune police, “These applications are generally used under the guise of know-your-customer (KYC) fraud or updating SIM and ATM cards so people tend to grant access easily.”An official of the cybercrime cell who records data for the cell said, “Every single day of this year, we have had at least one or two cases of remote sharing applications used for stealing money. Since these applications are most of the time used to steal card data and misuse it, it gets registered as bank and card frauds. While individual amounts are always small compared to other methods of hacking, given the number of such cases, the collective amount is substantial.”Even the website of one of these screen-sharing applications states, “With your first session request, you will also receive a security message urging you not to grant access to anyone you don’t know. Make sure that you trust the person contacting you and only then accept the request. Thereafter you can start your presentation and everything you do on your phone will be visible to your guest.”Bhagyashree Navatake, deputy commissioner of police, cybercrime cell, warned, “The methods to protect yourself from such attacks are to format your systems regularly. Do not click on unknown links or download applications unless they are sent by people well known to you. Even if you do use screen-sharing, do not share the screen with unidentified people.”Due to the risk associated with these applications, many companies are avoiding using them. An IT professional, 30, who did not wish to be identified, said, “Most companies have consciously decided not to use AnyDesk as it is highly unreliable. There is a code on the screen which, upon sharing, gives complete access to your screen. A lot of companies have found it to be problematic.”The elderly in and around the city however, who find it difficult navigating new technology without guidance, are proving to be soft targets for fraudsters. A man, 79, from Warje Malwadi was duped of Rs1 lakh in a credit card fraud after the accused managed to acquire his credentials while tracking a courier sent by the complainant. A case was registered at the Warje Malwadi police station on June 1. Turns out the accused got access to the senior citizen’s mobile phone screen and urged him to use his credit card to pay Rs5 just to know his confidential information like the CVV. Using this information gathered unbeknownst to the senior citizen, the accused used his credit card for online transactions worth Rs1 lakh, according to the police.It is learned that the trend of online theft using screen-sharing applications began in 2020 when major financial transactions started taking place online. For instance, the pandemic-induced lockdown necessitated cancellation of multiple flights leaving many passengers in want of refunds on their flight tickets. In one such case, a woman from Pune, 54, was duped of Rs3.2 lakh while trying to claim a refund on a cancelled flight ticket. On October 20 when she was trying to get a refund on a flight from Chennai to Pune that she had booked, she got the number of the concerned airline online and made a call. However, the person who answered the woman’s call made her download two applications which gave him remote access to the woman’s mobile phone in which her bank data was saved. Once she downloaded the apps, he asked her to send a message and using the same, he managed to siphon money from three bank accounts of the complainant and her family members.App attack· Callers ask victims to download the applications from app stores, or send links· The applications cannot share screens without sharing the code number which appears initially· In most cases, bank card or third-party payment application transactions are carried out using this method· The accused gets access to the screen and by extension, the OTP for payments without the victim’s knowledge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/online-theft-cases-using-remote-access-apps-on-the-rise-101628102445878.html

The SIT had summoned cops who were deputed at various locations during the protest and firing incident at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan on October 14, 2015. Apart from Baljit, SP Balbir Singh, DSP Gurjit Singh Romana, inspector Amarjit Singh Kular and sub-inspector Hari Krishan appeared before the SIT member, deputy inspector general of police Surjit Singh at Faridkot, and their statements were recorded. Last week, the SIT had recorded statements of 14 cops, including then Faridkot SSP (now commandant, 9th battalion, PAP, Amritsar) Sukhminder Singh Mann. Meanwhile, the SIT is waiting for the confirmation of the date from a forensic lab to conduct a lie-detector test on suspended inspector general of police Paramraj Singh Umranangal. On July 9, Umranangal appeared before the court at Faridkot and gave a written consent to undergo a lie-detector test in the Kotkapura case. The SIT had filed an application in a court last month, seeking permission to conduct the narco-analysis, polygraph test and brain electrical activation profile of Umranangal, former Punjab director general of police Sumedh Singh Saini and ex-Moga senior superintendent of police Charanjit Singh Sharma. However, Saini and Sharma had refused to undergo the test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-firing-sit-questions-accused-sp-four-other-cops-101628102268516.html

05-08-2021||Mumbai||Can’t open up trains for all as 1/3rd of citizens still susceptible to Covid-19, says Maharashtra’s task force member||Even as more relaxations in Covid-19 curbs have been introduced in Mumbai owing to a steady decline in the number of cases, restrictions to access local trains have been retained. Members of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force have emphasised three important aspects before opening public transport for all – achieving 70% vaccination coverage, random testing at stations and stringent implementation of double masking. Hindustan Times spoke to task force member Dr Shashank Joshi on the rationale behind their recommendations: Why can’t local trains be opened for all when other relaxations are being implemented? There are three important yardsticks for any city to relax their norms – the RT-PCR positivity rate has to be below 5% consistently for two weeks, there has to be 70% full vaccination coverage and zero tolerance for non-adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour. We haven’t been able to achieve 70% vaccination coverage as yet. If we take into account the number of citizens who are vaccinated and those who have been exposed to the virus, there is still at least one-third of our population that is unexposed. The circulation of the virus is shrinking, but this one-third population is susceptible. Let’s say if local trains are opened, it is this susceptible population that will be fast infected. Should people who have taken both the jabs be allowed on trains? Yes. However, conducting such checks will be cumbersome. With more relaxations and no local trains, buses are bearing the brunt with overcrowding. Won’t they become a breeding ground? It continues to be our fear. That is one of the reasons why we have been emphasising on creating safer travel environments before allowing everyone to take public transport. Safer environments will be created as we achieve 70% vaccination coverage and implement strict double masking. One should understand that Mumbai has immense challenges in its fight against Covid-19. The city’s humidity is conducive for droplet transmission and for the virus to thrive. Its population density is among the highest and Mumbaiites generally tend to crowd and congregate. Any potential crowding can upset the declining trend that we are experiencing now. Another crucial challenge is the Delta variant that has been rapidly transmitting. Mumbai predominantly has the Delta variant in circulation and a little bit of the Kappa variant as well. Therefore, a calibrated approach to reopening is important. How soon can more relaxations like local trains for all be implemented? Mumbai will open up more, gradually. It’s all about striking the right balance. The opening also depends on the readiness of the healthcare infrastructure for an unprecedented wave, the R0 or R-naught (which determines how transmissible the disease is) among other things. Overall, Maharashtra’s R0 has shown a decline, but any potential crowding situations can upset this trend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cant-open-up-trains-for-all-as-1-3rd-of-citizens-still-susceptible-to-covid-19-says-maharashtra-s-task-force-member-101628102086940.html

05-08-2021||Chandigarh||Sukhbir opposes plan to appoint full-fledged administrator for UT||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday termed the proposal to appoint a full-fledged administrator for the Union Territory by divesting the Punjab governor of this charge an another attempt to dilute Punjab’s claim to Chandigarh. “We will oppose this tooth and nail. Chandigarh is an inseparable part of Punjab and should be transferred to the parent state as soon as possible,” said Sukhbir in a statement. The SAD chief said there was no reason to appoint a full-fledged administrator for the UT from outside the state. “If at all an administrator has to be appointed till the UT is not transferred to Punjab, the officer should be from the parent state. Earlier also, the chief commissioner of Chandigarh used to be from Punjab.” Asserting that all decisions taken at the time of reorganisation of Punjab were being violated one after another, Sukhbir said the Centre was not following the 60:40 ratio for posting of officers in the UT. “Separate cadres have been created to reduce the strength of Punjab service officers in the UT and now even AGMUT officers are being posted on key posts in utter violation of the 60:40 formula,” he said. Stating that instead of correcting the wrongs being done to Punjab vis a vis Chandigarh, the SAD chief said it was condemnable that the Union government was now planning to dilute Punjab’s role in Chandigarh even further. “It was unfortunate that the NDA government was following the path of the Congress government by proposing to implement an anti-Punjab move which was also against the spirit of the constitution,” he said. He said the SAD had earlier too opposed a move to appoint a separate administrator for Chandigarh in 2016 by divesting the Punjab Governor of this charge. “We will launch an agitation to ensure this move does not fructify again,” he said. The SAD chief said Punjab had the first right over Chandigarh as the UT was established by uprooting people from villages belonging to Punjab. He said even though Chandigarh was still the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana, efforts were on to dilute its stake in the UT on one pretext or another.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-opposes-plan-to-appoint-full-fledged-administrator-for-ut-101628102029347.html

05-08-2021||Delhi||Calls for justice mount after Dalit girl’s rape||Mounting protests over the alleged rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl in southwest Delhi took a political turn on Wednesday as Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi visited the victim’s family and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accused the Opposition of politicising the tragedy.Kejriwal ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident, announced financial assistance of ₹10 lakh for the girl’s family and said the city government would appoint top lawyers to represent them.“The injustice done to the family is unfortunate and cannot be compensated, but the government will give ₹10 lakh to them and order a magisterial inquiry into the matter,” he told reporters. “There is a need to strengthen law and order in Delhi. I appeal to the central government to take firm steps in this direction,” he added.In the morning, Gandhi met the parents of the girl and assured them of all help and support.“The tears of the parents of the girl say one thing – that their daughter, who is the daughter of the nation, deserves justice. And, in this journey towards justice, I stand with them,” he tweeted in Hindi after the meeting.The BJP accused the Opposition of politicking.“It is unfortunate that they choose to see rapes and deaths of girls in those states where they are not in power and not in the states like Punjab and Rajasthan, where they have their governments,” Union minister Anurag Thakur told reporters.The girl, from a Dalit family, in Purani Nangal village near Delhi cantonment, was found dead by her parents in a local crematorium on Sunday night.The accused — a 55-year-old priest and three of his associates — say the girl died of electrocution while fetching water from a cooler but the family alleges that the suspects hurriedly cremated the body after raping her.The four accused -- who have been booked under sections pertaining to rape, murder and threatening charges, Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Prevention of Atrocities Act -- are in jail.Brinda Karat, leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah, demanding his intervention.In a statement, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “We have assured the family that they shall get justice and the persons held guilty will get the strictest punishment... We demand that the police file a chargesheet in 15 days and the case to be taken up in a fast-track court.”Autopsy inconclusive, protests swellPolice transferred the case to the crime branch and seized clothes worn by the four suspects on the day of the incident and sent it for forensic examination. An investigating officer said the clothes will be tested for DNA samples to ascertain if the nine-year-old girl was raped on the day of the incident.The three-member medical board conducting the autopsy of the child’s body told police it will be impossible to arrive at a conclusion because only charred remains were available for them to examine, said a senior police official.Since Sunday night, an arterial road near Delhi cantonment has been blocked by protesters from the Dalit community who accuse the police of lax action and demand justice.On Wednesday, demonstrators swelled with people arriving from across the National Capital Region and towns further away, including Panipat in Haryana and Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh.Several demanded capital punishment for the perpetrators.“We learnt about the protest on social media. It is necessary to show solidarity in such matters. Cases of violence against Dalits are increasing across the country,” said Rajesh Raj Jeevan, a 35-year-old social worker from Aligarh.Jaswindra Pahalwan, a 30-year-old protester from Haryana’s Sonepat, said: “The perpetrators should be hanged. It is an instance of violence against children, against women and against vulnerable groups. Only harsh punishment can help set an example.”Local moodDalits form roughly 20% of the Capital’s 20 million population and Valmikis -- the caste of the victim -- form around two-thirds of the scheduled caste population.Purani Nangal has a population of around 7,000, according to records of revenue department of the Delhi government, including around 100 families belonging to the Valmiki caste. Most of them are sanitation workers, drivers, factory workers or people engaged in menial jobs.Many houses have blue-coloured walls and tiles with pictures of Ravidas – a 14th century saint revered by Dalits — along with other Hindu deities.Over the last 30 years, the village has turned into an unauthorised colony with concrete houses, said Ram Sahai, a migrant from Rajasthan who settled in the village around 40 years ago with his family and took up sanitation work.A part of the village is inhabited by upper castes – many of whom are Brahmins, Thakurs and Banias.“The village has no record of enmity between caste groups. However, there have been at least two incidents of rape in the last three months. This is a major law and order issue...,” said Arun, a resident of the Valmiki colony in the village who uses only his first name.Amit Sharma, an upper-caste resident of the village, said, “This is more of a law-and-order related issue. The police and government should be more vigilant. This has got nothing to do with caste. This village has no record of caste violence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-dalit-girl-s-rape-murder-calls-for-justice-mount-101628101966596.html
05-08-2021||Chandigarh||Harsimrat, Bittu engage in verbal spat in Parliament complex over farm laws||Two Punjab MPs from Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Wednesday engaged in a public spat inside Parliament complex over the passage of farm laws.Congress MP from Ludhiana Ravneet Singh Bittu and Bathinda MP and former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal traded charges just before the day’s session started.Both Akali Dal and Punjab Congress MPs have been standing outside Parliament house for days to protest against the three farm laws and in support of the farmers.Bittu accused Harsimrat of being part of the Union cabinet that cleared the three farm bills and also aiding their passage in Lok Sabha.Hitting back, Harsimrat accused Bittu and other Congress MPs of staging a walkout and helping in the easy passage of the agriculture bills in the lower house.Harsimrat was standing with Akali Dal and BSP MPs and protesting when Bittu accused her of being a part of the cabinet that cleared the bills.The face-off took place in full public view and in front of the media.Bittu later attacked SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, asking where was the Lok Sabha member while Parliament and Kisan Sansad were on.“Where is Sukhbir Badal? Why is he not protesting and coming to Parliament? He is holding press conferences elsewhere but not coming to Parliament to raise the farmers’ issues,” Bittu said amid continued squabbling.Punjab MPs of Akali Dal, Congress and AAP have been demanding the repeal of the three controversial farm laws and have been giving adjournment notices in the Lok Sabha to discuss farm issues.Leaders of various parties have been going out of their way to show solidarity with farmers ever since the farmer unions declared that they would assess the performance of MPs on farmers’ issues and then decide on extending their support in elections.Punjab assembly elections are due in early 2022 and all parties are working overtime to keep the farmers on their side.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had earlier driven a tractor to Parliament to highlight the problems of farmers. The monsoon session of Parliament, which started on July 19, will conclude on August 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/harsimrat-bittu-engage-in-verbal-spat-in-parliament-complex-over-farm-laws-101628101907658.html
05-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Three nabbed for road rage after video of victim being beaten goes viral||The police on Tuesday arrested three men over an incident of road rage -- in which a man was allegedly hit with a brick multiple times in Central Delhi’s Ranjeet Nagar -- after a video of the assault went viral on social media.The video, which police said was recorded by a local on Monday night, was shared by Aam Aadmi Party MLA Amanatullah Khan, who also commented about the worsening law-and-order situation in the national capital.According to police, they received information about an incident in which some men had allegedly assaulted a man named Naushad Ali in Ranjeet Nagar at around 10.30pm on Monday.Ali’s wife, Gulnaj, who spoke to reporters outside the police station on Wednesday, said they were taking their daughter to a local doctor when the suspects fought with her husband for reportedly parking the scooter “on the middle of the road”.“They attacked my husband with bricks, which is seen in the video clearly. They also hit me and my daughter, who was unwell. She had fever so we had come to the clinic to get medicines for her,” she said.Police said that the fight started after the three men removed Naushad’s scooter from the road to make way for their Maruti Ertiga car. “Naushad scolded them for touching his scooter. In the process of taking their car ahead, it hit the scooter and a fight broke out. This is a case of road rage,” said an investigating officer.Police identified the suspects as Nikhil (only first name) and Atul Maan, who work as cab drivers, and Mehar Singh, who works in the admin department of a school in Dwarka.“Ali was being treated at the hospital and he was discharged from the hospital on Tuesday morning. Efforts were made to record his statement, but he did not cooperate. We registered the FIR on the basis of the DD (daily diary) entry and arrested the two persons,” said Jasmeet Singh, deputy commissioner of police (central).The officer said Naushad was yet to record his statement till Wednesday afternoon because he wasn’t well enough yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi3-nabbed-for-road-rage-after-video-of-victim-being-beaten-goes-viral-101628101845832.html
05-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt lowers rate of Covid-19 RT-PCR tests to ₹500 at private centres||The Delhi government on Wednesday slashed the price of RT-PCR tests — the gold standard in Covid-19 testing — from ₹800 to ₹500, and for the first time fixed the cost of a rapid antigen test (RAT) in Delhi at ₹300.The cost of home collection of RT-PCR test samples was also slashed from ₹1,200 to ₹700.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, while announcing the move on Twitter, said the new rates will help common people, and boost Covid-19 testing in the national capital.Both types of Covid-19 tests, however, will continue to be offered for free in all Delhi government-run hospitals, centres, temporary facilities and dispensaries, and the reduced rates notified by the city administration on Wednesday will pertain to tests conducted through private laboratories or in private hospitals.The order, issued by the state health department, said the new rates were applicable with immediate effect, and directed all labs and hospitals to display the reduced prices at “prominent places” within 24 hours.Covid-19 testing rates were last changed on November 30 last year, when the state capped the cost of an RT-PCR test conducted in a private facility at ₹800, and a home collection at ₹1,200, down from the flat ₹2,400 rate charged before that.A senior state health official said the order will also help patients being treated in private hospitals who have to mandatorily undergo an RT-PCR test before any medical procedure.Wednesday’s order for the first time fixes the cost of a rapid test in Delhi. “Until now there was no fixed price of RAT in Delhi. As a result, some private hospitals used to charge up to ₹1,200 per rapid test. The government received such complaints and, as a result, has fixed the rate of a rapid antigen test,” the official quoted above said.If any facility is found exceeding the government’s rates, the facility will be liable for penal action under relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act and the Indian Penal Code.The order came days after PathStore, a French firm and emerging pathology start-up, introduced a Covid-19 RT-PCR test at ₹299. “The precedent was soon followed by the Haryana government, which brought down the cost of an RT-PCR test to ₹299. Now the Delhi government has also brought down the rates,” the company said in a statement.Anubhav Anusha, global CEO and founder of GeneStore and PathStore France, said, “Amidst the pandemic, the high cost of an RT-PCR test is a major challenge for the economically weaker sections in accessing high quality Covid-19 testing services. We hope other state governments will appreciate the precedent set and introduce similar interventions.”The decision comes at a time when the Covid-19 caseload in Delhi is at lows not seen since the early days of the pandemic in April last year. On Wednesday, the city reported 67 new Covid-19 cases and zero deaths, according to data shared by the health department. The daily positivity rate stood at 0.09%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-lowers-rate-of-covid-19-rt-pcr-tests-to-500-at-pvt-centres-700-for-home-collections-101628101488127.html
05-08-2021||Pune||State can consider relaxations in Pune city if PMC sends proposal: Tope||PUNE Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope, on Wednesday, said the state government will reconsider its decision on providing relaxation to Pune city if the local authorities recommend the same.Tope was talking to HT on the deadlock emerging in the city after traders decided to be adamant in defying the 4 pm deadline following the government’s decision earlier this week not to offer any relief to Pune.“If there is a need of keeping the shops open till 8 pm then the local authorities should recommend this to the state government. If the local authority like municipal commissioner recommends shops to continue remaining open till 8 pm, and if he recommends the decision to the government, we will consider it,” Tope said over the phone.Tope said this after discussing the issue with chief secretary Sitaram Kunte. “I am conveying this after discussing it with the chief secretary,” he said.On Wednesday, defying the state government’s restrictions on shop timings, hundreds of shop owners and traders kept shops open past the 4 pm deadline. To end this deadlock between administration and traders health minister has suggested civic body send recommendations to extend shop timings to the state government.He, however, clarified that sending a relaxation proposal to the government does not mean it would be approved, but it just means that state administration would consider the recommendation would think over it.“BMC had sent a proposal to ease relaxations and the government gave a nod to that. On this ground, if PMC sends recommendations to Chief Minister’s office then we will think over it,” said Tope.Meanwhile, Tope accepted that the government has considered a city and rural parts as one unit while evaluating the positivity rate and recommended the continuation of testing and tracing. He also claimed that considering the positivity rate in Pune, the government will consider giving the district more vaccines than its allotted quota.While the city’s positivity rate for the past fortnight was around 3.3%, making it eligible for relaxations, Pune did not make the cut because the entire district’s positivity rate was above five per cent for July.

God knows whether we would achieve the target of December 31 that we have set,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said.On setting up oxygen buffer stock, the court said there is no clarity and the issue cannot be deferred for long in wake of the much anticipated third Covid wave. “Today, the situation may look fine but then everyone saw what happened in April-May. There is no escape from this (buffer stock of LMO). This is like insurance,” the bench saidA total of 10,295,389 people were vaccinated till Tuesday in Delhi, according to HT dashboard.The remarks by the bench came during a hearing on a bunch of pleas seeking better facilities to manage Covid crisis.Central government’s standing counsel Kirtiman Singh said the Delhi government has done enough for creating a buffer stock, and the state counsel could elaborate it.Delhi government’s counsel Rahul Mehra said they have a buffer stock of around 420 metric tonnes of LMO at different places with the suppliers and they will transfer the stock by August 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/create-a-buffer-stock-of-oxygen-delhi-high-court-tells-centre-101628101246445.html
05-08-2021||Lucknow||Meeting UP electricity regulator’s deadline for meters on power staff’s premises may be a tall order in poll year||Taking a serious view of non-implementation of its earlier directions on installation of energy meters on the premises of power personnel till date, the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) has set a deadline for UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) to complete the task by the end of the current financial year. “The commission directs that metering of LMV-10 connections should be completed by end of FY 2021-2022,” the commission said in its tariff order issued on July 29. The LMV-10 category refers to the unmetered power staff.A senior energy department official, however, said: “Considering the fact that there are assembly polls early next year, it is impossible for the state government to give a go-ahead to the UPPCL to install meters on the powermen’s premises and invite their wrath.”  The powermen in UP are very sensitive to the issue of metering of their residences and have strongly and successfully opposed attempts in this regard in the past despite the fact that UP is believed to be the only state where power employees and pensioners enjoy the luxury of using unmetered and unaccounted electricity. UPERC, in November 2017, abolished LMV-10 category, putting consumers in this category at par with any other domestic consumer categorised as LMV-1 for the purpose of billing. The move implied that the UPPCL was supposed to charge the same tariff from unmetered power personnel as applicable to unmetered domestic consumers. This step, however, did not achieve the purpose and the UPPCL/discoms failed to provide any information to UPERC on the number of meters installed on the power staff’s residences whenever it sought details on the subject.“Despite repeated directions of the commission, the same (installation of meters) has not been done by the licensees,” the commission observed in the July 29 tariff order and fixed a higher tariff for them so that it would act as a disincentive to using unmetered power. “Hence, the commission is forced to re-compute the revenue for LMV-10 consumers (power staff) considering the average consumption per consumer per month to be 700 units and at ₹7.00 / kWh (the rate of LMV-1, other metered category – highest slab),” the regulator ordered and clarified that the revenue deemed to have been realised from would be added to UPPCL’s final revenue realisation and same would be taken into view while revising the tariff in future. For the power staff, based on the balance sheet data and past trend, the commission has computed deemed revenue of Rs. 61.05 crore, ₹70.18 crore, ₹55.28 crore and ₹140.68 crore of the state discoms namely DVVNL (Dakshinanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Ltd), MVVNL (Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Ltd), PVVNL (Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Ltd) and PuVVNL (Purvanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Ltd) respectively. As per the data provided by UPPCL to the regulator, there are 98,218 power men consuming unmetered electricity at their residences with their total electricity load having been estimated to be 4,15,912.88 KW. The power personnel together consumed 577.52 million units of electricity in 2020-21, according to the data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/meeting-up-electricity-regulator-s-deadline-for-meters-on-power-staff-s-residential-premises-may-be-a-tall-order-in-poll-year-101628098006990.html
05-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra plans to expand SDRF for quicker response to disasters||To ensure an efficient and speedier response to disasters, the state government is working on expanding the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) by stationing these teams in State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) camps across Maharashtra. This brownfield expansion of the SDRF’s facilities will do away with the need to acquire land to set up these units, which often causes delays in building stations for rescue teams.It is also looking at creating synergies between the disaster response teams and agencies like the home guards and civil defence during any adverse events.After the floods in the Konkan and parts of western Maharashtra, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that a separate force on lines of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) will be established in all districts and that the SDRF will be strengthened. The state government drew flak for the delay at the beginning of the rescue operations at most of the affected areas. One of the reasons was the delay in reaching the rescue teams to the disaster sites.Vijay Wadettiwar, minister, relief and rehabilitation, confirmed they were planning to locate SDRF units in SRPF camps. In the first phase, the department is planning to focus on the most affected districts like Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur. It also wants to have two teams for the three districts of Mumbai, Thane and Palghar, added Wadettiwar.“This proposal will be discussed in the meeting of the state cabinet,” said Wadettiwar, adding that they were also planning to acquire a helicopter for undertaking rescue operations.Modelled on the lines of the NDRF, which is a specialized force to respond to natural and manmade disasters, the SDRF has a strength of 428 personnel and officers. It has two companies at Nagpur and Dhule.Officials from the relief and rehabilitation department of the state government said they were planning to establish SDRF units in the existing State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) camps. The SRPF groups—there are 16 groups at 13 locations in Maharashtra—will have a small unit of the disaster relief force, which will be used exclusively for disaster response.SRPF camps are located at Pune, Daund, Mumbai, Solapur, Navi Mumbai, Kolhapur, Jalna, Nagpur, Dhule, Amravati, Hingoli, Aurangabad and Gondia. The SRPF also has a training centre at Nanvij in Daund. Locating SDRF teams in SRPF camps will do away with the need to acquire land for these facilities.“There is a strong need to enhance the state’s disaster response capacity,” he urged, pointing to how the frequency of cyclones on the western coast was on the rise, while parts of Konkan, western Maharashtra and Vidarbha were prone to flooding.The SDRF personnel are drawn from the SRPF. However, the official said that they would have to recruit personnel for the new SDRF units as the reserve police may have little manpower to spare. “The SDRF handles a diverse range of challenges like chemical disasters, civil disasters and building collapses, which requires a different level of qualifications and training,” he explained, adding that this staff will have to be recruited afresh.“The idea is to have more bases than we have today for an immediate response (to disasters),” said Aseem Kumar Gupta, principal secretary, relief and rehabilitation department, adding that the SRPF idea was among the options on the table. The integration between the SRPF and SDRF was being discussed and the state is also looking at synergies with the home guards and civil defence and the creation of disaster response capabilities at the local level.The NDRF has a battalion consisting of around 1,149 people stationed at Sudumbare at Talegaon near Pune to cover Maharashtra and Goa. It has stationed three teams consisting of 45 men each, including engineers, technicians, and medical staff, and two sniffer dogs in each at the Andheri sports complex in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-plans-to-expand-srpf-for-quicker-response-to-disasters-101628097705692.html
05-08-2021||Pune||No CET for regular undergraduate courses, tough road ahead for admissions||Even as there has been a 9% increase in the passing percentage of students at the Higher Secondary School (HSC) year, for 2020-21, the Maharashtra education department has decided not to hold a common entrance test (CET) for any non-professional undergraduate course. The state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant on Wednesday announced that there will no CET this year for regular UG courses at the college and university level. Admissions therefore for the UG courses in Arts, Science and Commerce courses will be done based on the Class 12 results. While Samant clarified that colleges will be allowed to increase seats, the decision of not conducting a CET means top colleges in Pune, as well as the rest of the state, are likely to have higher cut-offs as compared to last year, which will lead to more competition among students for admission. The minister also made it clear that CET will be held for other professional courses by the state CET cell. Samant was speaking at a press conference in Pune after a joint meeting with all the education department senior officials and non-agricultural vice- chancellors. This year more than 1.3 million students have passed Class 12, while seats available for different non-professional curses in 11 state universities stands at 1,211,620. “There is a huge gap in the number of students and available seats in various courses, including professional and non-professional courses. Still to conduct the CET for regular Arts, Science and Commerce faculty is not possible due to the time period. To discuss this we held a joint meeting with all the vice-chancellors and it was decided not to conduct CETs for regular UG courses. Admissions would happen on Class 12 results. And if any university or college wants to increase seats they can apply to the education department till August 31,” said Samant. As many as 99.63 % of the 1.31 million students cleared HSC (Class 12), the results for which were declared on Tuesday by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE). In absence of an exam due to Covid, the board used an assessment formula, leading to a rise in passing percentage by 8.97 % as compared to 2020. In Pune Division, the passing percentage for Class 12 students this year is at 99.75%. According to officials from the education department, there are various steps involved in planning to conduct the CET exams, which usually takes four months. “Currently, we have Covid restrictions in the state and in such a situation, conducting one more examination for non-professional courses won’t be feasible for the department,” Samant said. For professional courses, CET examinations will start from August 26 onwards, though a detailed schedule will be declared only after talking to concerned authorities. There won’t be any CET exams for courses which did not have it last year as well. “The professional courses CET exams will be held online though students need to go to a centre to appear for it”, said Samant, adding “We are planning to increase the number of CET exam centres for this year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-cet-for-regular-ug-courses-tough-road-ahead-for-admissions-101628093984030.html
05-08-2021||Noida||'You are in cahoots with them’: Supreme Court roasts Noida Authority over Supertech towers||The Supreme Court on Wednesday chided the Noida Authority for its “shocking exercise of power” in sanctioning two residential towers of real estate developer Supertech on a green area, and then blocking right to information requests from homebuyers about the building plans.The two-judge bench, which heard the Noida Authority blamehome buyers for complaining too late, told the authority that it should, as a public authority, take a neutral stand.“From the way you are arguing it appears that you are the promoter. You cannot be fighting against the homebuyers. As a public authority, you have to take a neutral stand. Your conduct reeks of corruption from the eyes, ears and nose and you are trying to find fault with the homebuyers,” the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah said.The bench also reserved its verdict on appeals by Supertech and Noida authority against the Allahabad high court verdict on April 11, 2014, to demolish two towers, Apex and Ceyane, constructed as part of realty major Supertech’s Emerald Court project.The high court, which sought prosecution of officers concerned for collusion with the developer, ordered the demolition in 2014 because the two towers were built too close to each other and violated the Noida Building Regulations of 2010 that requires the minimum distance to be 16 metres. Further, the high court noted that the developer hadn’t taken the consent of homebuyers as required under the Uttar Pradesh Apartment Owners Act, 2010.During arguments on the appeals on Wednesday, the bench noted how the authority helped the developer.“It’s a shocking exercise of power by the Noida Authority. When flat purchasers asked you to reveal the building plans for the two towers, Apex and Ceyane, you wrote to Supertech and refused to part with it after the company objected. Only after the Allahabad high court order, you provided it. It is not that you are in league with Supertech, you are in cahoots with them,” said the bench.In defence, lawyer Ravindra Kumar who represented Noida Authority, said the homebuyers did not complain when Supertech was increasing flats and floors in this project with each successive building plan. Supertech’s original building plan of June 2005 provided 550 flats and 14 towers. This was increased to 689 flats in the revised plan in December 2006. The Apex and Ceyane towers with 24 floors came in the third revised plan of November 2009. And in the final plan of March 2012, these two towers were increased from 24 to 40 storeys.Kumar said: “Between the second and fourth plan, the number of proposed flats were increased from 689 to 1,573. So it was not that the original plan was sacrosanct. This was never challenged by the homebuyers.”The real estate firm, too, blamed homebuyers.“The homebuyers did not go to the high court in 2009 but only after 2012. What were they doing for three years, negotiating?” asked senior lawyer Vikas Singh who represented Supertech.Supertech cited other housing projects in Noida which had a distance of six to nine metres between towers while in case of the company’s twin towers, the distance between the towers is 9.88 metres or 32 feet. Singh said it is the discretion of the builder to create a building block by keeping the buildings adjacent to each other or separate so long as the FAR (floor area ratio) permits.The two towers facing demolition have 915 flats of which 633 were booked. Of them, only 252 flat buyers still remain as 133 homebuyers have re-invested in other Supertech projects while 248 have taken a refund.The Emerald Court Owners Resident Welfare Association, which secured relief from the high court in 2014, attributed the delay cited by the real estate firm and the authority to their attempts to collect information.Senior advocate Jayant Bhushan, appearing for the homebuyers, said that, since 2009, residents were seeking information about the two under-construction towers that were coming up in the green area shown to us while purchasing flats. “I applied under the Right to Information law for the building plan from Noida authority which they refused. That is when I decided to approach the high court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/you-are-in-cahoots-with-them-sc-roasts-noida-authority-over-supertech-towers-101628088643369.html

05-08-2021||World||'We lost Greenville': Raging Dixie Fire decimates Northern California town||A 3-week-old wildfire engulfed a Northern California mountain town, leaving much of the downtown in ashes, while a new wind-whipped blaze also destroyed homes as crews braced for another explosive run of flames Thursday in the midst of dangerous weather.The Dixie Fire, swollen by bone-dry vegetation and 40 mph (64 kph) gusts, raged through the northern Sierra Nevada town of Greenville on Wednesday evening. A gas station, hotel and bar were among many fixtures gutted in the town, which dates to California’s Gold Rush era and has some structures more than a century old.It wasn't immediately known how many buildings were demolished, but photos and video from the scene indicate the destruction was widespread.“We lost Greenville tonight,” U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa, who represents the area, said in an emotional Facebook video. “There's just no words.”As the fire’s north and eastern sides exploded, the Plumas County Sheriff’s Office issued a Facebook posting warning the town’s approximately 800 residents: “You are in imminent danger and you MUST leave now!”The growing blaze that broke out July 21 was the state’s largest wildfire and had blackened over 504 square miles (1,305 square kilometers). It had burned dozens of homes before making its new run.“We did everything we could,” fire spokesman Mitch Matlow said. “Sometimes it’s just not enough.”About 100 miles (160 km) to the south, officials said between 35 and 40 homes and other structures burned in the fast-moving River Fire that broke out Wednesday near Colfax, a town of about 2,000 residents. Within hours it ripped through nearly 4 square miles (10 square kilometers) of dry brush and trees. There was no containment and about 6,000 people were under evacuation orders across Placer and Nevada counties, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.Early in the week, some 5,000 firefighters had made progress on the Dixie Fire, saving some threatened homes, bulldozing pockets of unburned vegetation and managing to surround a third of the perimeter.More fire engines and bulldozers were being ordered to bolster the fight, Matlow said. On Wednesday, the fire grew by thousands of acres and an additional 4,000 people were ordered to evacuate, bringing nearly 26,500 people in several counties under evacuation orders, he said.Red flag weather conditions of high heat, low humidity and gusty afternoon and evening winds erupted Wednesday and were expected to be a continued threat.Winds were expected to change direction multiple times on Thursday, putting pressure on firefighters at sections of the fire that haven't seen activity in several days, officials said.The trees, grass and brush were so dry that “if an ember lands, you’re virtually guaranteed to start a new fire,” Matlow said.The Dixie Fire was running parallel to a canyon area that served as a chimney, making it so hot that it created enormous pyrocumulus columns of smoke. These clouds bring chaotic winds, making a fire “critically erratic” so it's hard to predict the direction of growth, he added.Dawn Garofalo fled with a dog and two horses from a friend's mountain property, and watched the soaring cloud grow from the west side of Lake Almanor.“There’s only one way in and one way out,” she said Wednesday. “I didn’t want to be stuck up there if the fire came through.”And about 150 miles (240 kilometers) to the west of the Dixie Fire, the lightning-sparked McFarland Fire threatened remote homes along the Trinity River in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The fire was only 7% contained after burning through nearly 33 square miles (85 square kilometers) of drought-stricken vegetation.Similar risky weather was expected across Southern California, where heat advisories and warnings were issued for interior valleys, mountains and deserts for much of the week.Heat waves and historic drought tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in America's West. Scientists say climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.More than 20,000 firefighters and support personnel were battling 97 large, active wildfires covering 2,919 square miles (7,560 square kilometers) in 13 U.S. states, the National Interagency Fire Center said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-lost-greenville-raging-dixie-fire-decimates-northern-california-town-101628177256229.html

Afghanistan has been witnessing a surge in violence after the Taliban fighters intensified their offensive against the government forces.Pakistan has been long accused of helping the Taliban militarily, financially and with intelligence, a claim repeatedly denied by Islamabad. With US troops nearing their final withdrawal, Pakistan is being seen as an important player in the Afghan peace process.Yusuf told a press briefing in Washington DC that Pakistan wants to maintain good relations with the Afghan government but their “vitriol and rhetoric” was making it impossible, the Dawn newspaper reported."We are beginning to see a very conscious, deliberate effort by the Afghan government to scapegoat Pakistan," said Pakistan’s NSA, who was wrapping up a week of talks with the Biden administration."We have made it absolutely clear that we are with the international community on where this goes. But the world also needs to be clear that the US invests in a political settlement,” he added.Also Read | Taliban terrorists shoot 21-year-old Afghan girl dead for not wearing veil: ReportThe Taliban has made rapid gains in Afghanistan and now reportedly controls 223 districts even after a late push back by the government forces. Reiterating the statement of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, Yusuf said that the stakeholders have to arrive at “some compromise given the ground reality”. He added that Pakistan has no leverage over the Taliban after the troop withdrawal.The United States wants Pakistan to keep its borders open for Afghan refugees as the war-torn region looks at a possible civil war. But Yusuf said Pakistan, which currently hosts about 3.5 refugees, is no longer in a position to accept more refugees. "Peace in Afghanistan is non-negotiable for us. We under no circumstances are prepared to see protracted instability that in the past has caused spillover into Pakistan," the NSA said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-accuses-afghan-govt-of-making-it-scapegoat-amid-taliban-offensive-101628180288040.html
05-08-2021||World||These countries to ignore WHO's call for moratorium on Covid booster shots||In a major snub to the World Health Organization (WHO), many countries have decided to go ahead with their booster shot plan for elderly and vulnerable groups. On Wednesday, WHO director-general Tedros Adhnom Ghebreyesus called for a moratorium on third vaccine dose of recommended two-dose regimen until September end in a bid to enable all countries to vaccinate at least 10% of their population.According to the WHO, low-income countries have been able to administer only 1.5 doses for every 100 people due to a lack of vaccine supplies. Calling for an urgent reversal of global vaccine policy, Tedros told a press briefing that 80% of the vaccine doses administered worldwide have gone to high- and upper-middle-income countries."I understand the concern of all governments to protect their people from the Delta variant. But we cannot accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it, while the Earth globe Europe-Africa's most vulnerable people remain unprotected," the WHO chief said.Despite the strong statement by the UN health agency, France, Germany and Israel appear to press ahead with their plan. After WHO’ call, French President Emmanuel Macron said his government was working on rolling out a third Covid-19 vaccine dose for the elderly and vulnerable from September, reported news agency Reuters.German health ministry stated that it intends to administer boosters to immunocompromised patients, elderly and nursing home residents from September but would also donate at least 30 million doses to poorer countries. "We want to provide the vulnerable groups in Germany with a precautionary third vaccination and at the same time support the vaccination of as many people in the world as possible," Reuters quoted the health ministry as saying.Israel has already kicked off a campaign to give booster doses to older citizens. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said in a statement that those over the age of 60 are six times more susceptible to severe illness without a third dose. While the United States hasn’t directly commented on the WHO’s call, the White House said the administration was prepared to provide a third dose of vaccine if needed.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/these-countries-to-ignore-who-s-call-for-moratorium-on-covid-booster-shots-101628174984057.html
05-08-2021||World||China pledges 2bn Covid vaccine doses to the world: Prez||China will provide 2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to the world in 2021, President Xi Jinping said on Thursday.In a written address to an international coronavirus cooperation forum, Xi added that China was also willing to donate $100 million to the Covax global vaccine distribution scheme, the news agency Xinhua reported.“China will provide 2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines for the world and offer $100 million to Covax throughout this year,” the Xinhua report said, quoting the Chinese president.China, Xi said, has always adhered to the concept of a human health community, provided vaccines to the world, especially developing countries, and actively carried out cooperative production. “This is what vaccines are supposed to do as a global public good. China will continue to do everything in its power to help developing countries cope with the outbreak,” Xi was quoted as saying.In May, 2020, in a speech at the 73rd World Health Assembly, Xi had pledged that China will make its coronavirus vaccine a global public good once available, a promise he repeated in April this year at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2021.Besides administering more than 1.7 billion doses of vaccines within the country, Beijing has exported and donated the largest number of jabs globally - despite concerns over the safety and efficacy of China-made shots.China has so far provided more than 700 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines overseas and, over the next four months, will provide 110 million doses to Covax, a global vaccine-sharing initiative, the Chinese foreign ministry said in late July.It has also donated some 26 million jabs worldwide.Chinese vaccine companies have started joint production in many countries including the UAE, Indonesia, Malaysia, Egypt, Brazil, Turkey, Pakistan, and Mexico, with producing capacity exceeding 200 million doses.Xi’s statement on Thursday comes in the backdrop of China experiencing the worst Delta variant-driven Covid-19 outbreak since last year.Over 500 locally transmitted cases have been reported from across the country, triggering mass testing, lockdowns, and restrictions on travel.The ongoing outbreak has spread to Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected in late 2019, which had been virus-free since China contained the initial outbreak there early last year.The city has detected 19 cases as of August 4 and is currently testing its entire population of 12 million people.A total of 85 new confirmed Covid-19 cases were detected for August 4, down from 96 a day earlier, data from the national health commission (NHC) showed on Thursday; 62 were locally transmitted.As of August 4, mainland China had recorded 93,374 confirmed cases, with the cumulative death toll unchanged at 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-pledges-2bn-covid-vaccine-doses-to-the-world-prez-101628173074070.html

The probe will also “hold anyone responsible for dereliction of duty,” according to the report.The majority of deaths occurred in the provincial capital city Zhengzhou, where 292 were killed after torrential waters led to landslides, buildings collapsing and the flooding of underground spaces, the official Henan Daily reported, citing the local government. Fifty people were missing across the province, including 47 in Zhengzhou. According to the official tally, 14 people drowned in submerged subway cars, while another six were killed in a swamped tunnel.The deaths prompted local residents to question if the city government had failed to warn the public, shut down transportation in advance and provide timely rescue efforts. Zhengzhou, a city of 10 million, received a year’s worth of rain in just three days last month starting July 20. Across Henan -- a hub for agricultural and food production, coal and metals as well as heavy industry -- more than 14.53 million people were affected, and direct economic loss reached 114.3 billion yuan ($17.7 billion), according to the provincial government.The floods and its aftermaths also added to the tensions between China and the West after the provincial branch of the Communist Youth League, an official arm of the ruling party, used social media to urge members of the public to confront a BBC reporter over his coverage of the disaster, the New York Times reported. Later, a correspondent for German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle was confronted in Zhengzhou by a crowd of people that may have confused him for the BBC journalist.The incident prompted the U.S. to express concern over harassment and intimidation of foreign correspondents in China. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the comments “distort facts, confuse right with wrong, and aim to pressure China with unfounded charges,” adding that rights of foreign journalists were “fully protected.”Officials have warned that China can expect more extreme weather events amid climate change. A typhoon struck Zhejiang province south of Shanghai last month, causing 3.35 billion yuan in damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-orders-probe-into-henan-floods-as-death-toll-surges-past-300-101627911178800.html

Speaking to CNN, the tech billionaire said he had “several dinners” with Epstein in hopes of raising billions of dollars for combating global health issues. Gates claimed that the relationship ended as soon as he realised Epstein’s assurance regarding the philanthropy project wasn’t a “real thing.”"I had several dinners with him, you know, hoping that what he said about getting billions of philanthropy for global health through contacts that he had might emerge. When it looked like that wasn't a real thing, that relationship ended," the Microsoft co-founder said.Bill Gates and his wife Melinda French Gates announced their divorce in May, triggering media scrutiny of the former’s alleged extramarital affairs. According to Wall Street Journal, Melinda had been working with the divorce lawyer for over a year before the duo announced their separation, partly because of her husband’s dealings with Epstein.Also Read | Bill Gates, Melinda French officially divorced: ReportEpstein, who had pleaded guilty in two state prostitution charges and had registered as a sex offender, hanged himself in 2019 awaiting a sex trafficking trial."It was a huge mistake to spend time with him, to give him the credibility of being there," Gates told CNN while declining to respond to the WSJ report that linked his divorce with the Epstein connection."It's a time of reflection, and at this point, I need to go forward," he added.Earlier this week, a King County Superior Court judge signed the dissolution decree finalising the divorce of Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates. The duo has decided to continue working as co-chairs of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the most influential private foundations in the world. However, if any of them decide that they can’t work together, French Gates will resign her position as co-chair and trustee and will receive personal resources from Gates for her philanthropic work, the foundation said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-was-a-huge-mistake-bill-gates-regrets-meeting-convicted-sex-offender-epstein-101628169984542.html
05-08-2021||World||Fake network using India's Covid-19 situation for pro-China propaganda: Report||A network of more than 350 fake and repurposed social media accounts is pushing pro-China narratives and discrediting those that are critical of the Chinese government, according to a new study. Researchers at the Centre for Information Resilience (CIR) found that the narratives pushed by these fake or repurposed profiles on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are similar to the content disseminated by Chinese government representatives and state-run media.The study suggests that the network seeks to influence several issues including US gun laws, human rights abuses in Xinjiang, global conflict, racial discrimination and US response to India’s devastating second Covid-19 wave. Citing the grim situation in India during the second Covid wave, the network targets the response of the US.Some of these social media accounts alleged that the US was allowing vaccines to expire when there was a dire need for Covid-19 shots in India. In a YouTube video titled ‘India's out-of-control epidemic highlights the hypocrisy of American human rights’, the social media account claimed that large stockpiles of unused vaccines were kept in factories in the United States when India needed those vaccines.The video also features a tweet from Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO Adar Poonawalla in which he urged US President Joe Biden to lift the embargo on exports of raw material needed for vaccine manufacturing. “Some of the network has promoted long-text memes on Twitter about India and coronavirus with negative sentiment towards the US,” the report said.Some of the Twitter handles involved in pro-China propaganda were found to be using a mix of machine-learning generated images as profile pictures and relying on a much larger network that was using more authentic appearing images, anime images and repurposed accounts. The AI-generated images are created by a type of machine learning framework called StyleGAN to create realistic-looking images of people who don’t exist.Also Read | India prepared for long haul with China over LadakhThe report also suggests that there was a change in ownership of authentic-appearing accounts at some point, either through a “takeover from password dumps or a purchase from a seller of stolen accounts.” The researchers conducted a manual review of hundreds of accounts across different social media platforms and concluded that there are between 300-500 such accounts on Twitter, 40-55 accounts and pages on Facebook and 12 accounts on YouTube.Benjamin Strick, the author of the report and CIR’s director of investigations, said in a statement that the aim of the network appears to delegitimize the West by amplifying pro-Chinese narratives. He said that the content was posted in English and Chinese but there’s no concrete evidence that these accounts are linked to the Chinese government.“The narratives CIR uncovered in this influence operation have strong similarities to content seen on the accounts of Chinese Government representatives and China state-linked media. However, this is not an indication of attribution,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fake-network-using-india-s-covid-19-situation-for-pro-china-propaganda-report-101628165232954.html

The patient, a 43-year-old man who lives in the Sham Shui Po neighbourhood, has, so far, shown no symptoms and has no recent travel history, but Covid-19 antibodies were found in his blood, government officials said, adding he has not been vaccinated.The Centre for Health Protection (CHP), which is Hong Kong’s agency responsible for disease prevention and control, said the man had tested negative for the viral disease under the government’s regular testing requirement since May this year, according to a report by the Straits Times on Thursday.However, after being hospitalised on Tuesday, the man tested positive for antibodies against Covid-19 and the epidemiological, clinical and laboratory findings are compatible with a re-positive case previously undiagnosed, the CHP said in a statement.The patient’s colleagues, neighbours and those who visited the same places that he did during the incubation period would now have to get themselves tested for the virus, according to Bloomberg.The local case came as a setback for Hong Kong which was planning to allow its vaccinated residents and tourists from all but 10 countries to enter the city from August 9.Vaccinated tourists, including those from Canada and the United States, will be allowed to enter Hong Kong for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic last year. And, fully inoculated residents from countries, like India and the United Kingdom, that were banned earlier can come back home.As of Wednesday, Hong Kong has administered vaccines to 2.6 million of its citizens and is urging the remaining ones to receive the jab at the earliest. Bloomberg also reported that schools in the city must have 70 per cent students in a certain grade inoculated before resuming in-person teaching from September. The total Covid-19 cases in Hong Kong currently stand at 12,003 which include 212 deaths, 11,721 recoveries and 70 active cases.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-sees-1st-local-covid-19-case-in-2-months-as-it-readies-for-tourists-101628163507622.html

The terrorists dragged Nazaneen, 21, out of a car while she was on her way to Balkh district centre, according to the report.The Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid, however, has denied the claims.The group has intensified its offensive against Afghan security forces and civilians over the last few weeks as foreign troops are completing the withdrawal. The Taliban has insisted on a “genuine Islamic system”, saying it is the only way to ensure women’s rights are in line with cultural tradition and religious rules.Under the Taliban’s harsh version of Islamic law, girls were banned from school and women accused of crimes such as adultery were stoned to death in stadiums. With the group now reportedly controlling 223 districts, they have reimposed repressive laws that defined their rule from 1996-2001 before they were ousted by a US-led invasion.Also Read | Women can't leave home alone, men have to grow beard: Taliban rules in captured Afghan districtsReports suggest that Islamic fundamentalists are forcing women to cover themselves from head to toe and not allowing them to leave home without a male companion. In some parts captured by the Taliban, they have banned shops from selling goods to women not accompanied by a male relative. People breaking the rules face punishment including public beatings.“They urged women in a statement to not leave without a relative (Moharam) and also urged men to have beards,” Merajuddin Sharifi, a civil society activist, was quoted as saying by Ariana News last month.Meanwhile, Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) are reported to have pushed back the Taliban fighters in some areas in the last 24 hours. The Afghan defence ministry on Thursday said that the security forces killed at least 303 Taliban terrorists and wounded another 125 in multiple operations carried out in Nangarhar, Laghman, Ghazni, Paktika, Kandahar, Zabul, Herat, Jowzjan, Samangan, Faryab, Sar-e Pol, Helmand, Nimruz, Kunduz, Baghlan and Kapisa provinces.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-terrorists-shoot-21-year-old-afghan-girl-dead-for-not-wearing-veil-report-101628155742807.html

The two other thresholds -- vaccination rate and ICU occupancy -- will remain the same, he said.“Once 40% of adults have been vaccinated, the number of new cases becomes less relevant because most cases show little to no symptoms, hence reducing the burden on public infrastructure,” said Zafrul.While the nation added a record 19,819 infections on Wednesday, 98.1% of the cases showed light to zero symptoms, according to the Health Ministry. Still, there was always a chance that their health may deteriorate over time, Director-General Noor Hisham Abdullah said in a statement.With new infections piling up -- daily cases topped a record 20,000 for the first time on Thursday -- the government is focusing on speeding up its vaccination drive. About 31% of the adult population received both doses of the vaccine, and 62% got at least one dose as on Aug. 3, according to the health ministry.Third phaseThe hospitalization rate must be 3 cases per 100,000 of the population for states to move from the second to the third phase, said Zafrul. Currently, the states of Penang, Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang and Perak are in the second phase, which allows for opening up more economic sectors.The third phase involves reopening of all economic activities with the exception of those on the negative list, according to the plan. Based on this new indicator, the government allowed Perlis, Sarawak and Labuan to enter the third phase beginning Wednesday, Zafrul said.To get to the final stage, the rate must be 1.3 cases per 100,000 people, he said. States in this phase may reopen their social and economic sectors under new norms, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said in July. Most states are expected to reach this phase as early as October, according to the premier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-to-stop-using-daily-covid-19-cases-as-metric-to-ease-curbs-for-states-101628153074828.html

The nation’s second-largest city last year endured one of the world’s longest and strictest lockdowns, and only emerged from its most recent one on July 28. Sydney, meanwhile, has issued stay-at-home orders until at least August 28.“The advice to me from the experts if we were to wait even just a few days, there is every chance that instead of being locked down for a week, this gets away from us and we are potentially locked down until we all get vaccinated,” Andrews said.The lockdowns show the limits of Australia’s so-called “Covid-zero” strategy, which has relied on closed international borders and rigorous testing to eliminate community transmission of the virus. Its economy, particularly the domestic tourism and retail sectors, is increasingly being hit by the outbreaks.The move by Melbourne authorities comes on the same day that New South Wales state reported 262 new infections -- a record number since the highly contagious variant leaked into Sydney’s community in mid-June. Five more people died, and four of them weren’t vaccinated, Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in the city, which has been in lockdown for almost six weeks.The outbreak’s spread to other regions of New South Wales saw Berejiklian on Thursday announce that the Hunter Valley region -- including Newcastle, a city of around 500,000 people -- will be placed into a one-week lockdown.“Every jurisdiction around the world is finding delta challenging,” Berejiklian said. “We can try and eliminate it but we know the vaccine is critical to stopping the spread.”Australia’s federal government said last week the country would begin reopening and start to avoid snap lockdowns once 70% of the entire adult population had been fully vaccinated. Plans to reopen have been hampered by a tardy vaccine roll-out, with only enough doses to cover 25% of the population administered.Clamping DownEven as other developed economies like the U.S. and U.K. open up, Australia is further isolating after imposing strict border restrictions when the pandemic began early last year.The slow vaccine drive -- which has placed renewed criticism on Prime Minister Scott Morrison ahead of elections due by May -- has made it particularly vulnerable to the delta variant, which is increasingly leaking out of the quarantine system for international arrivals.The lockdowns show the limits of Australia’s so-called “Covid-zero” strategy, which has relied on closed international borders and rigorous testing to eliminate community transmission of the virus. Its economy, particularly the domestic tourism and retail sectors, is increasingly being hit by the outbreaks.Queensland state recorded 16 new cases in the community on Thursday, and it was unclear whether Brisbane and other regions there would exit lockdown as planned on Sunday. Eleven other infections were detected aboard a LNG tanker off the city of Gladstone, authorities said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melbourne-locks-down-for-6th-time-as-delta-spreads-in-australia-101628145319326.html

The move is aimed at countering Beijing's increasing naval presence in an area that carries a history of military disputes, reported Japanese media, adding that the nukes will also help defend against a potential Chinese attack.Japan is planning to deploy the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) missile units on the island of Ishigaki, which is only 306km from the Taoyuan Taiwan International Airport. The new unit, which aims to be operational in 2022, is also set to be manned by 500 to 600 troops of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (SDF).Also Read | After face-off with India, China embroiled in maritime dispute with JapanThe Japanese defense ministry is also reportedly planning to install an electronic warfare unit on the Yonaguni island by the end of 2023. According to local news outlets, the country is also building a new SDF base on the island of Mageshima.A brief history of the disputeChinese naval forces -- the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) -- have recently increased their presence in the Miyako Strait, a waterway that lies between the Miyako Island and the Okinawa Island and consists of a wide passageway with international waters and airspace. Being the widest strait in the Ryukyu Islands, it is one of the only few international waterways that China intends to use to gain access to the Pacific Ocean from the East China Sea.It is in this region that Japan and China are involved in a dispute over the Senkaku Islands (Diaoyutai Islands), a territorial row that has mired diplomatic relations between both countries since at least the early 2010s. Beijing, which continues to claim the Senkaku Islands as the country's 'inherent territory', has rapidly built up artificial islands with military infrastructure in the region.China also claims complete sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of about 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two lands have been governed separately for more than seven decades.In the process, China is now laying claim of sovereignty over almost the entire maritime region.Japan's defence plan against ChinaJapan's new missile installations are meant to serve as a deterrent and are well within the range of disputed territories such as the Diaoyutai Islands, ensuring that the country will have a suitable defence in the case of a potential Chinese attack in the region.With the new missile chain set to be deployed next year, the Ishikagi Island will become the fourth land in the Nansei island chain to be armed with missiles. This island chain runs southwest from Kyushu to Taiwan and is situated on the strategic first island chain that stretches from the Kuril Islands in the north to Borneo in the south.One of the new units will also reportedly include surface-to-ship and ground-to-air missiles, while another unit will handle the initial reaction to a military attack. The missile batteries on Ishigaki will join existing units on Amami-Oshima, Okinawa, and Miyako Islands, according to Taiwan News.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-ups-the-ante-against-china-plans-to-deploy-nukes-near-taiwan-next-year-101628140356132.html
05-08-2021||World||Covid-19: Covaxin submits documents for emergency use authorisation in Canada||While the manufacturers of the Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin have completed their submission to Canadian health authorities for emergency use, they have also stressed that the jab is the only one to have shown efficacy against the Delta variant in a controlled clinical trial.Covaxin has been developed and manufactured in India by Bharat Biotech, which entered into an agreement with the American firm Ocugen for the North American market, and the latter established a presence in Canada through Vaccigen to facilitate the review process with Health Canada.Vaccigen applied for emergency use authorisation (EUA) on June 30 and started submission of data and documentation on July 15, a process that was completed on July 20. In a tweet on July 30, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada confirmed the review was “under way”.Ken Inchausti, head, investor relations & communications of Pennsylvania-based Ocugen, told the Hindustan Times that while it was not possible to apply a “specific timeline to Health Canada’s review”, they believed that the “Phase 3 data submitted provide a compelling case for the efficacy and safety of Covaxin”.With Canadian health authorities warning of the portents of a potential fourth wave in the country sparked by the Delta variant, he underscored the relevance of Covaxin in this context. In response to emailed queries, Inchausti said, “With the rapid spread of Covid-19, including its Delta variant, it is clear that additional vaccine options have the potential to help reverse this negative trend. Currently, there are no head-to-head studies between Covaxin and other Covid-19 vaccines. Covaxin is the only investigational Covid-19 vaccine to demonstrate, in a controlled clinical trial, efficacy against the Delta variant. (efficacy rate: 65.2%).”Ocugen’s Canadian affiliate, the Alberta-headquartered Vaccigen is facilitating regulatory activity in the country. Unlike the USA, where the Food and Drug Administration asked Ocugen to apply for full authorisation, Health Canada has allowed EUA application.While Covaxin also waits clearance from the World Health Organization, if it is approved in Canada, it will be an important outcome for thousands of Indian citizens, students, temporary workers and new residents, who have been inoculated by the jab but have to face entry restrictions currently as it is not in the approved list yet. Among the vaccines available in India at this time, only Covishield, the version of Astra Zeneca manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, has been granted EUA in Canada.While Canada has announced it has secured enough vaccines to fully jab its entire eligible population, Inchausti said Covaxin attacked several targets on the actual virus while others only targeted the spike protein. “We believe this has value as we see the virus continue to mutate into new variants through changes in the spike protein,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-covaxin-submits-documents-for-emergency-use-authorisation-in-canada-101628141571775.html

"We're now dealing with, really, a different virus," said Fauci.As the virus continues to spread due to insufficient vaccination rates, it is being given "ample" time to mutate into a more dangerous new variant in the fall and winter, Fauci said."[Q]uite frankly, we're very lucky that the vaccines that we have now do very well against the variants -- particularly against severe illness," Fauci said, emphasizing that this might not be the case with a new variant."If another one comes along that has an equally high capability of transmitting but also is much more severe, then we could really be in trouble," he said."People who are not getting vaccinated mistakenly think it's only about them. But it isn't. It's about everybody else, also."Moreover, other variants are already cropping up. South Korea has reported two cases of highly transmissible delta plus variant of the coronavirus.It is the first time that the country has reported the Delta Plus variant, considered a sublineage of the Delta variant, Yonhap News Agency reported on Tuesday citing the country's Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA).Some experts believe the Delta Plus variant could be more contagious than the Delta variant.The Lambda variant, which originated from Peru last year, has already been detected in the US, reported Axios.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-cases-may-double-in-us-as-variant-worse-than-delta-could-be-coming-says-fauci-101628134601505.html

It did not say if the officers also shot Lanz, but witnesses said there was a volley of gunfire in the incident.Gonzalez was rushed to the hospital but did not survive.A bystander was also injured but taken to hospital with minor injuries and later released, the FBI said.No motive was suggested for the attack. Lanz, of Acworth, Georgia, had a long list of arrests according to local Georgia news reports citing court records.He had been charged with attacking a police officer, making terroristic threats, and burglary, among other offenses.According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, he was out on bail and had been ordered by a judge to be evaluated for mental health and substance abuse.The attack forced a full lockdown of the Pentagon and its thousands of workers for 90 minutes.Gonzalez was mourned by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who was not in the building at the time of the attack."This fallen officer died in the line of duty, helping protect the tens of thousands of people who work in -- and who visit -- the Pentagon on a daily basis," Austin said in a statement."He and his fellow officers are members of the Pentagon family, and known to us all as professional, skilled, and brave."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-attacker-identified-as-27-year-old-georgia-native-motive-still-unclear-101628132563557.html

Hong Kong re-imposed quarantine on travelers from the mainland, though an exception remained for the southern Guangdong province which neighbors the financial city.Officials reported on Thursday 94 new local infections detected Wednesday, including 32 asymptomatic infections, adding to the country’s broadest Covid-19 threat since the pathogen first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019. Though 61% of the population has been vaccinated, China has stuck to its aggressive containment playbook of mass testing and targeted lockdowns in a bid to stamp out the highly infectious variant.In just two weeks, confirmed cases -- people infected and sickened by the virus -- have grown to more than 500. The infections can be traced back to three cluster areas in China: an outbreak among airport cleaning staff in eastern city Nanjing, another found at a hospital treating Covid patients in Zhengzhou, and sporadic cases detected in Yunnan, the province bordering Myanmar.Delta has spread to Wuhan, which has been virus-free since China contained the initial outbreak there early last year. The city has detected 12 cases as of Aug. 3 and is currently testing its entire population of 12 million people.Chinese authorities urged people to cancel business trips and vacations, while some colleges around the country have asked students, especially those from high-risk areas, to delay their return to school for the new semester.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-imposes-new-curbs-as-delta-variant-swarms-nearly-half-the-country-101628131699453.html

All changes come into effect Sun 8th August at 4am," UK Transport Secretary tweeted."While it’s right we continue our cautious approach, it’s great news to open more destinations for people wanting to connect with families, friends and businesses across the globe, all thanks to our successful domestic vaccination programme," he said.The decision has come as a relief for the Indian diaspora in the UK, who had been demanding the easing of travel norms between India and Britain.Under the legal rules for countries on the amber list, passengers must take a Covid test three days before departure and book in advance for two COVID tests to be taken upon arrival in England as well as complete a passenger locator form on arrival.On arrival in England, passengers must quarantine at home or in the place they have confirmed as their location for 10 days and take a COVID-19 test on or before day two and on or after day eight.Under-18 and those fully vaccinated in the UK are exempt from the home quarantine, as well as those who have received two doses of Covid vaccine in the EU and US.Also exempt are those “fully vaccinated in the UK or under the UK vaccine programme overseas; under 18 on the day you arrive in England and resident in the UK or in a country with a vaccination programme approved by the UK and part of a UK-approved vaccine trial”.Covishield, the India-manufactured Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, is likely to be covered under this exemption.The update of the travel list came alongside an announcement that the cost for solo travellers from destinations still on the red list staying at a quarantine hotel will go up from August 12, from GBP 1,750 to GBP 2,285.The charge for an additional adult sharing a room will increase from GBP 650 to GBP 1,430.According to the government, this is to "better reflect the increased costs involved".Meanwhile, seven countries are moving to the green list – Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Romania and Norway – and France has been moved off the “amber watchlist”.For countries on the green list, people will not have to quarantine when returning from these nations, regardless of their vaccination status, although they will have to take a pre-departure test and another one two days after arrival.Four countries will be put on the red list: Mexico, Georgia, La Reunion and Mayotte.The “green watchlist”, which gives travellers notice of countries whose green status is at risk of changing, remains in place and is unchanged with 16 countries on the list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eases-travel-curbs-moves-india-from-red-to-amber-list-101628130128683.html

That would help achieve the WHO’s goal to vaccinate at least 10% of the population in every country by that date, protecting health care workers and vulnerable people.“I understand the concern of all governments to protect their people from the delta variant, but we cannot and we should not accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it while the world’s most vulnerable people remain unprotected,” Tedros said.He also called on vaccine producers to prioritise Covax, the programme set up last year to equitably distribute vaccines to every corner of the planet. Many lower-income countries rely on Covax, but the initiative has only delivered a fraction of the 1.8 billion doses it aims to ship by early 2022. High-income countries have received almost one dose for every person -- although most vaccines require two doses for full immunisation -- compared with low-income countries, which have only been able to administer 1.5 doses for every 100 people, Tedros said.WHO has been advocating for more equitable distribution of vaccines for months, though it lacks the authority to compel countries to follow its wishes.After an early and effective vaccination drive beginning in December, Israel became the first country last week to widely roll out booster shots to halt a resurgent spread of the virus. A growing number of countries, such as Sweden and Greece, are studying this possibility.“We don’t have a full set of evidence around whether this is needed or not,” said Kate O’Brien, who heads the WHO’s vaccination division. The main reason for the growing infections isn’t the failure of vaccines, but rather the easing of other health measures, she added.In high income countries, 101 doses per 100 people have been injected so far. That figure drops to 1.7 doses per 100 people in the 29 lowest-income countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-calls-for-moratorium-on-booster-shots-101628121391840.html
05-08-2021||World||Countries around the world race to rein in wildfires||Wildfires continued to torment the Mediterranean as well as the western part of the US, as authorities in Greece, Turkey and California scrambled to protect their civilians and property from further damage.Fire crews across Greece struggled amid a record heat wave to contain new blazes, including one near the birthplace of the ancient Olympic Games - Olympia. Temperatures in parts of Greece reached 45 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, in what authorities describe as the worst heat wave since 1987. No deaths or severe injuries have been reported from any of the Greek wildfires.In Turkey, firefighters were battling 16 wildfires across the country on Wednesday, including one near a coal-fired power station, with high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds fanning the flames.In the past eight days, 167 fires have been brought under control, forestry minister Bekir Pakdemirli said.Meanwhile, wildfires have already produced a record amount of carbon emissions in Russia’s Siberian region of Yakutia, with still more weeks of the fire season to come, according to the European Union’s Copernicus satellite monitoring unit.California fire growsCalifornia’s largest wildfire continued to grow on Wednesday as thousands of firefighters prepared for a tougher fight as dangerous weather returns.A red flag warning was issued through Thursday because of hot, bone-dry conditions with winds up to 64kmph. That could drive flames through timber, brush and grass, especially along the northern and northeastern sides of the vast Dixie Fire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/countries-around-the-world-race-to-rein-in-wildfires-101628120307462.html
05-08-2021||World||Virus infects 200mn people||The Covid-19 pandemic crossed a grim milestone on Wednesday as the total number of coronavirus infections globally has now crossed the 200 million mark, according to the widely followed virus tracker Worldometer. The monitor also showed that the total number of coronavirus-related deaths around the world reached 4.26 million.The World Health Organization (WHO), meanwhile, disclosed that more than 4 million new Covid-19 cases were reported globally in the last week, driven mostly by spikes in the Mideast and Asia. The UN health agency said on Wednesday infections have been increasing for more than a month, although the worldwide number of deaths dropped by about 8%.In West Asia and further east, however, deaths increased by more than a third. In the last week, the highest numbers of coronavirus cases were reported by the US, India, Indonesia, Brazil and Iran. More than 130 countries have now reported cases of the fast-spreading Delta variant of the virus.In Britain, the government will offer coronavirus vaccines to 16 and 17-year-olds in the coming weeks after an independent body of scientists that makes recommendations over the roll-out changed its advice.In China, which is seeing its worst Covid outbreak since the start of the pandemic a year and a half ago, saw on Wednesday dozens more cases reported around the country and the sealing off of a key tourist city.A Covid-19 hotspot was emerging in the city of Zhangjiajie. The city ordered residential communities sealed on Sunday. In an order on Tuesday, officials said no one could leave the city.At the same time, China has begun to promote its vaccination campaign among minors as authorities try to control a surge in Delta cases. More than 450 people have been infected in two weeks, sending millions into lockdown. As many as 71 new domestic cases were reported on Wednesday for the previous day.Indonesia recorded a grim milestone of more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday, data from the country’s health ministry showed.In France, dozens of restaurants in Brittany have vowed to defy new rules requiring them to check whether diners have been vaccinated, tested negative for Covid-19 or recovered from the disease before serving them. From August 9 on, people will need to produce a Covid health pass for certain activities.With inputs from Sutirtho Patranobis||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virus-infects-200mn-people-101628119465317.html
05-08-2021||World||US plans to require Covid-19 shots for foreign travellers||The Biden administration is taking the first steps toward requiring nearly all foreign visitors to the US to be vaccinated for the coronavirus, a White House official said Wednesday.The requirement would come as part of the administration’s phased approach to easing travel restrictions for foreign citizens to the country. No timeline has yet been determined, as interagency working groups study how and when to safely move toward resuming normal travel. Eventually all foreign citizens entering the country, with some limited exceptions, are expected to need to be vaccinated against Covid-19 to enter the USThe official spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the policy under development.The Biden administration has kept in place travel restrictions that have severely curtailed international trips to the US, citing the spread of the delta variant of the virus. Under the rules, non-US residents who have been to China, the European Schengen area, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Brazil, South Africa and India in the prior 14 days are prohibited from entering the USAll travellers to the US, regardless of vaccination status, are required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken within three days of air travel to the country.The Biden administration has faced pressure to lift some restrictions from affected allies, the air travel industry and families who have been kept separated from loved ones by the rules. Many have complained that the travel restrictions don't reflect the current virus situation — particularly as conditions in the US are worse than in many of the prohibited nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-plans-to-require-covid-19-shots-for-foreign-travellers-101628114786485.html
05-08-2021||India||Bronze, worth the wait in gold||Tokyo: Under the hot Tokyo sun, they lay on the glaring blue turf, their shirts soaked to the skin with sweat.A 41-year long wait had ended. India, once an invincible force that won six Olympic gold medals on the trot, last won an Olympic medal at Moscow 1980, and then appeared to simply fade away from the international game.On Thursday, they were back, having beaten Germany, medallists at the last four Olympics (champions in 2008 and 2012), in the bronze medal play-off. “Main toh wahin pe let gaya (I just lay down there). I had no words.” With those not so famous lines, the Indian men’s hockey captain, Manpreet Singh, described the feeling of having made history. The clash was one befitting the occasion — an attacking, furiously fast-paced game with end-to-end action. Germany took the lead early, in the second minute, and the pressure mounted. India scrambled up and down the pitch, looking frazzled but frenetic in defence. Then, in the 17th minute, Nilakanta Sharma received a ball in the midfield, swerved past two German players, and swept a defence-splitting pass to Simranjeet Singh, who scored with a breathtaking shot. It told the story of how far this team had come in the last two weeks that Simranjeet, who came to Tokyo as a standby player, was playing a starring role. Germany replied with two more quick goals, a minute apart. It was 3-1, and it seemed like the dream would be shattered. But here’s where the Indians showed they deserved to be back among the world’s elite. In the next eight minutes, they unleashed the kind of magic that changes matches and wins medals. Hardik Singh pounced on a rebound after a powerful drag-flick from Harmanpreet Singh struck the goalkeeper in the 27th minute, and slammed it home before any of the German defenders could react. Harmanpreet then slotted home a penalty corner in the 29th; Rupinderpal Singh drove the ball home off a penalty stroke in the 31st; and Simranjeet, in the right place at the right time, tapped in after a tearing run down the flank from Gurjant Singh in the 34th.From 1-3, it was 5-3, and there was nothing the Germans had been able to do about it.The game was from there on was open, flowing, full of verve, as Germany tried to hit back. They reduced the deficit to one in the 48th minute, and stepped up the pressure the last 12 minutes, forcing one penalty corner after another. Each time, Amit Rohidas came charging out at the shot; and if it went past him, PR Sreejesh was there, leaping to make saves. Here is another story that defines this team — Sreejesh, 33, a veteran of three Olympics, on the verge of retiring a few years back, rescuing India with preternatural reflexes throughout the Olympics. In this match, too, it eventually boiled down to Germany vs Sreejesh. With 6.8 seconds left on the clock, Germany got the last of their 13 penalty corners . When the shot came screaming at the goal, Sreejesh held a padded hand out and deflected the ball out. The Germans sank to the turf, realising it was over. The Indians ran wildly, shouting at the top of their lungs. Manpreet fell on his knees and broke down in tears. Rupinder ran to him, and the two long-time teammates hugged. “After we lost to Australia 7-1 (in the group stage), I was very sad that we lost by such a big margin,” Manpreet said later. “But Bobby (Rupinder) came to me and said, ‘wait till the 5th, we will return with a medal.’ So when he came to me today I told him, ‘Bobby what you told me has happened’. We didn’t get a medal in the Olympics for so long. I can’t express what I am feeling now.” Sreejesh joined them, before perching himself on top of the goalpost. “A goalkeeper’s is a lonely job. Most of the time, I am alone in my goal and he (the goalpost) is my best buddy,” Sreejesh said. “So it was my way of celebrating with my buddy.” On Wednesday, the eve of their match, India’s coach Graham Reid did something unusual. He organised a medal ceremony for the team. He asked each player to stand on a chair and imagine they were on the podium with a medal around their neck. It fired the team up. “I came here (to the stadium) thinking about that,” said Sreejesh. When it was all over, the team got together in the customary huddle with Reid. Together, they offered a prayer of thanks. “Before the game I asked the guys to make sure they bring the next level if something happens,” Reid said. “For example, if you are down, you need to bring the next level of play and they did that very well.” Former players showered the team with praise for bringing Indian hockey back into the spotlight.“We are back where we belong. This is where we always were when we all played. We are back on the podium. This has given a lease of life once again to hockey in India.” said Ajit Pal Singh, 1975 world cup winning captain. “It’s done. The team showed today that we can win in modern hockey. The next generation or the youngsters, the team has sparked a new self-belief and confidence that we can win at the Olympics.” said former India captain Dilip Tirkey.That’s what it was -- a bogey off the back, and the start of something new.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bronze-worth-the-wait-in-gold-101628188195524.html
05-08-2021||India||Former Bengal CPI(M) leader’s daughter responds to show cause for article on CM Mamata||Ajanta Biswas, daughter of Anil Biswas, the former state secretary of the West Bengal unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), has replied to the show-cause letter the party sent her for writing an article on chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Jago Bangla, the daily mouthpiece of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), last week. The article, which projected the chief minister as a pathbreaker, appeared on Saturday. Though not active in politics, Ajanta Biswas is a member of the CPI(M). “A CPI(M) local unit in Kolkata has received her reply. It will be examined before we decide our next step,” said Kallol Majumdar, secretary of the CPI(M)’s Kolkata district committee. Majumdar said last week that usually a member is given a week to reply to a show-cause notice but Biswas would be given three days. Anil Biswas, who died in 2006, was one of the most successful strategists against the TMC. He was a bitter critic of Banerjee who was the main face of the opposition during the Left Front regime. CPI(M) leaders were embarrassed when Jago Bangla printed a four-part series on women empowerment in Bengal politics that Ajanta Biswas wrote. She is a professor of history at Kolkata’s Rabindra Bharati University. The articles were prominently carried on the editorial page. The last part focused on the chief minister while the first three research-based pieces highlighted women from the pre and post-Independence era. “After the articles appeared, Ajanta Biswas voluntarily wrote us a letter saying these were based on research. She did not mention why they appeared in the TMC mouthpiece. We have to study her reply to the show-cause letter,” said Majumdar. The episode, however, has not ended for the CPI(M). Two days ago, the daughter of a late state chief of the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), one of the main partners in the Left Front, wrote an article in Jago Bangla criticizing the CPI(M) and supporting Ajanta Biswas. Basundhara Goswami, the daughter of former RSP state secretary minister Kshiti Goswami, called the CPI(M) a “Stalinist party” and said arrogance of its leaders has ruined the Left in Bengal. She condemned the CPI(M) for taking action against Biswas. Kshiti Goswami, who was Bengal’s PWD minister for many years during the Left regime, died in 2019. “We take no responsibility for the article because Basundhara is not a party member. She was never even a member of our students’ front, unlike Ajanta Biswas,” RSP state secretary Manoj Bhattacharya told HT. A state CPI(M) leader, who did not want to be named, said, “Our party has not taken any decision on the article Goswami wrote because she is not involved in Left politics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-bengal-cpi-m-leader-s-daughter-responds-to-show-cause-for-article-on-cm-mamata-101628186814473.html
05-08-2021||India||These 6 Indian airports will soon use facial recognition for boarding passengers||As many as six airports in India will soon use facial recognition technology for facilitating biometric boarding system, Union minister of state for civil aviation, VK Singh, told the Lok Sabha on Thursday. A trial project based on the technology is currently underway at these airports.The civil aviation ministry had in August 2018 released a policy on ‘Digi Yatra’ that aims to offer a “contactless, seamless and paperless handling of passengers at airports from the entry gate of the terminal to the boarding point,” according to an official statement.“Work has been awarded for implementation of Biometric Boarding System (BBS)…at six airports namely – Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Pune, Varanasi and Vijayawada,” Singh further told the House.He added that following the completion of the trial project at the aforementioned airports, the system will be implemented across India at all airports in a “phased manner.”The minister also informed Parliament that in the next four to five years, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) plans to invest nearly ₹25,000 crore towards the expansion or development of existing as well as new terminals of various airports using modern technology.“Route rationalisation in the Indian airspace is being carried out in coordination with Indian Air Force, using modern air traffic flow management techniques to develop shorter flight routes and lower fuel consumption by airlines,” Singh said.In a separate written reply, he pointed out that the Centre has received the Regional Connectivity Fund (RCF) levy of ₹1,904 crore so far. A ₹5,000 crore levy is collected for each scheduled flight on certain routes to fund the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS), Singh added.“Till now…Viability Gap Funding (VGF) of an amount of ₹1,253 crore has been disbursed,” the minister noted.While answering another question on whether the government is aware that several citizens whose travel plans got affected due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic are yet to receive a refund of credit shell amount from airlines, Singh agreed to problems faced by passengers."Due to COVID-19 pandemic situation and consequent lockdown, air passengers had faced problems of cancellation of flights and refunds for the tickets cancelled, '' he said.When specifically asked about Air India, Singh said that the airline’s cumulative revenue dipped to ₹12,138.77 crore in 2020-21, while expenses shot up to ₹18,694.43 crore during the same period.In another reply, the minister said that the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) hasn’t prescribed guidelines specifying life for an aircraft to fly in India. Highlighting that there isn’t any term as “old aircraft” specified by DGCA, he added that aircraft are deemed as “airworthy” based on their maintenance according to the “approved schedule laid down by the manufacturer.”Singh further stated that online ‘examination on demand’ is also being planned by DGCA for flying cadets in order to augment the number of licensed pilots in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/these-6-indian-airports-will-soon-use-facial-recognition-for-boarding-passengers-101628185524107.html
05-08-2021||India||Centre moves bill in House to stop retrospective tax||The government on Thursday introduced a Bill in Lok Sabha to prevent the income tax department from raising tax demands retrospectively, a move that also attempts to end long-pending disputes with foreign firms such as Vodafone Plc and Cairn Energy Plc that together involve a sum of over ₹20,000 crore. The move is widely seen as investor-friendly, and also brings to an end messy litigation and arbitration, especially with Cairn, which has seen the company staking claim to India’s overseas assets. The Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2021, introduced in the Lok Sabha by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, proposes to amend the Income Tax Act, 1961, and the Finance Act, 2012, which were amended during the tenure of then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to introduce the retrospective tax law, which has, in the years since, come to stand for all that’s bad in India’s tax regime. “The Bill proposes to amend the Income Tax Act, 1961 so as to provide that no tax demand shall be raised in future on the basis of the said retrospective amendment for any indirect transfer of Indian assets if the transaction was undertaken before 28th May, 2012 (i.e., the date on which the Finance Bill, 2012, received the assent of the President),” the Bill said.The retrospective tax law was introduced through the Finance Act, 2012 after Vodafone won a case in the Supreme Court against the I-T department’s demand of ₹11,000 crore in tax dues. The retrospective tax provisions were also applied to Cairn, when it was exiting from Cairn India Ltd in January 2014. The initial demand was for ₹10,570 crore.In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that gains arising from indirect transfer of Indian assets were not taxable under existing laws. This prompted the then government to amend the income tax law through the Finance Act, 2012, with retrospective effect. It allowed the income tax department to retrospectively raise tax demands for gains arising from the sale of shares of a foreign company if its assets were located in India.Stating reasons behind the amendment in the Bill, Sitharaman said: “It is further proposed to provide that the demand raised for indirect transfer of Indian assets made before 28th May, 2012 shall be nullified on fulfilment of specified conditions such as withdrawal or furnishing of undertaking for withdrawal of pending litigation and furnishing of an undertaking to the effect that no claim for cost, damages, interest, etc, shall be filed.” “It is also proposed to refund the amount paid in these cases without any interest thereon,” she added.The Bill is an attempt to end around 18 vexed legal disputes, particularly with Cairn and Vodafone, people aware of the matter said, asking not to be named. Once passed, it will also require the government to refund part of the tax already paid by companies such as Vodafone and Cairn. HT could not immediately assess the size of these refunds.Spokespersons for Cairn did not respond to a query on this matter. A Vodafone spokesman declined comment . A person close to one of the companies said: “This is a good signal to international investors. Companies [Cairn and Vodafone] would also like to amicably settle the dispute outside the court.” For Vodafone Idea (Vodafone India’s current avatar after its merger with Idea Cellular), the announcement could provide some relief. The company is staring at a huge payout to the government for adjusted gross revenue liability, and spectrum, and Kumar Mangalam Birla, who stepped down as its chairman on Wednesday, wrote to the cabinet secretary in June offering to surrender his entire stake in Vodafone India to the government to keep it going, and pointing out that the company would collapse without relief on its payouts. On September 25, 2020, an international arbitration tribunal in The Hague, the Netherlands, ruled that the Indian government’s decision to retrospectively amend the Income Tax Act, 1961, in the 2012-13 budget to impose a tax liability on Vodafone Plc, along with interest and penalties, was not consistent with an investment treaty signed between India and the Netherlands. Another international arbitration tribunal, constituted under the agreement between UK and India for the promotion and protection of investments and the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), in December 2020, ruled in favour of Cairn. Last month, Cairn Energy Plc also secured an order from the French court, Tribunal judiciaire de Paris, to freeze through judicial mortgages residential real estate owned by the government of India in the central Paris.Experts avoided commenting on individual cases of retrospective tax disputes. Himanshu Parekh, partner-tax at consultancy firm KPMG India said the proposed amendment will help curtail long drawn litigation on the aspect of “indirect share transfers” undertaken prior to May 28, 2012, and provide tax certainty to multinational companies (MNCs). “The relief from tax liability will be subject to certain conditions such as withdrawal of cases and claims for costs, interest and damages by the relevant taxpayers.” “Retrospective amendments in tax legislation negate the fundamental principle of certainty and consistency required for attracting foreign investment into the country. The decision to withdraw the retrospective amendment on indirect transfers by the government must be applauded as this is not just a timely retreat from the confrontation position but instead assuages the concerns of the foreign investors,” said Ajinkya Gunjan Mishra, partner at law firm L&L Partners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-moves-bill-in-house-to-stop-retrospective-tax-101628185613780.html

In a statement issued on the second anniversary of the Indian government’s move to scrap the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and to split the region into two union territories, the general secretariat of OIC reiterated “its call to revoke all these steps”. The OIC described the Indian government’s steps as “unilateral” and said they were aimed at altering the “internationally recognised disputed status of the territory as stipulated in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions”. Responding to the reference to the Kashmir by the OIC, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said: “We categorically reject yet another unacceptable reference to the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir issued by the general secretariat of OIC.” In an apparent reference to Pakistan’s frequent attempts to rake up the Kashmir issue through the OIC, Bagchi added, “OIC has no locus standi in matters relating to the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral part of India. It is reiterated that the OIC general secretariat should refrain from allowing vested interests to exploit its platform for comments on internal affairs of India.” The OIC, in its statement, also reiterated its solidarity with the people of Jammu and Kashmir in their “quest for the right of self-determination”. It opposed any changes to the demographic composition of Jammu and Kashmir and called for respect of basic human rights. The OIC’s general secretariat also called on the world community to increase its efforts to resolve the Kashmir issue in line with UN Security Council resolutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-oic-statement-on-kashmir-asks-it-to-bar-vested-interests-from-using-platform-101628185374421.html

Union minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan said that the government is in talks with several countries for mutual recognition of the Covid-19 vaccination certification.He said that there is no multilateral protocol related to travel currently for people who have been vaccinated against Covid-19. “Most countries require a negative COVID-19 report, along with compliance with country-specific Covid protocols. Since some countries have specified their position in regard to vaccines that would exempt travellers from quarantine, India is engaging various nations for the mutual recognition of vaccination certifications,” Muraleedharan told the Rajya Sabha.Muraleedharan said that there were multilateral agreements including under the supervision of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) regarding Covid-19 vaccine certificates but no decision has been taken till date. He said India is a part of the ongoing discussions.Several nations in Europe have accepted Covishield as a valid vaccine paving the way for students to take admissions or resume their studies in those countries.Covaxin has not yet received approval from several countries as Bharat Biotech tries to get an emergency use approval from WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-planning-to-introduce-vaccine-passports-says-govt-101628184349161.html
05-08-2021||India||In Odisha, kin of hockey Olympians overjoyed after bronze medal win||Seconds after the final whistle in the match for the bronze medal was sounded some Indian players jumped on goalkeeper Sreejesh while a few others covered their faces. A few more players ran around the field elated.Far away in Saunamara village of Sundargarh, the family members and neighbours of defender Amit Rohidas too erupted with joy while converged around the television. The elder brother of the Indian team’s vice captain Birendra Lakra missed the match as his TV set had stopped functioning. Rohidas, who has been fearlessly charging at the penalty corner shooters at a ball travelling over 200 km per hour, was the most dependable man of the team in pool matches as well as the knockout stage, rushing out to defuse the opponent’s penalty corner attempt. Lakra did not play in today’s match.“Your fearless energy on the field was commendable, Amit Rohidas. You were truly a rock-wall intercepting those penalty corners,” tweeted PM Modi while congratulating him on his stopping 15 penalty corners during Thursday’s match. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik too praised Rohidas and the hockey team’s vice-captain Birendra Lakra for the bronze medal and invited them to Bhubaneswar on August 16 for a felicitation ceremony.The Odisha Olympic Association announced that it will honour Rohidas and Lakra with cash awards of ₹1 lakh each for the team’s performance. Earlier, CM Naveen Patnaik had announced a cash prize of ₹2.5 crore for the bronze medal winners.At Saunamara, Rohidas’s family sat glued to their TV since morning hoping that the Indian team would win a medal in hockey and fulfil his later father’s dream. “Our father died of kidney failure in October last year when Amit was in the SAI camp at Bangalore. He came back for father’s last rites for a few days and rejoined the camp. It was our father’s wish that someday Amit would help the Indian team win a medal for India. Had he been alive, he would have been very happy,” said Niranjan Rohidas, Amit’s elder brother. His neighbours too sat around a LCD TV watching the match since morning.Born in Saunamara village, the same place where former Indian defender and skipper Dilip Tirkey was born, Amit is the only non-tribal from Odisha to represent the country at the international level. Like most children in Saunamara, considered the nursery of hockey in Odisha, he started with a bamboo stick, as there was hardly any access to proper hockey sticks in the village. He joined Panposh Sports Hostel in Rourkela in 2004 and started out as a forward, but on the advice of his coach Bijay Lakra he switched to defence as Lakra thought he had a good physique and capacity.He got his first major breakthrough in 2009 when he bagged the Indian cap for the Under-18 Asia Cup held in Myanmar. In the 2016-17 edition of the Indian Hockey League (IHL), playing for Kalinga Lancers, Amit showed his skill as a defender against penalty shootouts. Over time, he would soon be seen as the successor of former Indian captain Dilip Tirkey, known for his defending skills.“Amit is undoubtedly the best defender right now against penalty corners. It’s dangerous to rush out against an incoming ball and the delay of a fraction of a second can be dangerous. But he knows no fear. I have seen him growing from his younger days and the way he is playing, he has a long way to go,” said Tirkey.In Birkira village of Sundargarh, Birendra Lakra’s elder brother could not watch the match as his TV set had stopped working. “After the match was over, my brother called up from Tokyo and added my mother, sister and brother-in-law in a conference call to tell us that India has won the bronze medal. We were very happy. I could not watch any of the matches my brother played due to a malfunctioning TV. I could only get information from my friends about the results of matches,” said his brother Sujit Lakra. “But I am so happy that India could win after 41 years.”The 31-year-old Lakra, a veteran of over 200 international matches, made his Olympics debut in 2012 London Olympic Games, but unfortunately missed Rio Olympics due to a major knee surgery in 2016. A superb defender, Lakra excelled in the 2018 Champions Trophy, when the opponents could breach his rock-solid defence only 6 times. During the Argentina tour earlier this year, it was Lakra who stood out with his defensive work at crucial junctures as the team won 3-0 against the defending Olympic champions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-odisha-kin-of-hockey-olympians-overjoyed-after-bronze-medal-win-101628183694330.html
05-08-2021||India||India to host events on terror, maritime security during UNSC presidency||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will chair a virtual open debate focused on global cooperation for maritime security on August 9 as part of signature events being organised by India during its presidency of the UN Security Council this month. The high-level debate on the topic “Enhancing Maritime Security – A case for International Cooperation” will be part of the Security Council’s agenda item of maintenance of international peace and security. “This would be the first time that an Indian prime minister would be presiding over a meeting of the UN Security Council,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday. The President of Congo Felix Tshisekedi, who is also president of the African Union, will participate in the debate. As part of its presidency of the Security Council for August, India is organising three signature events focussed on maritime security, peacekeeping operations and counter-terrorism. While the Security Council has discussed maritime security in the past and adopted a few resolutions on certain aspects, officials said the India believes the time has come to address different dimensions of the issue in a holistic manner and through international cooperation. The open debate is expected to look at issues such as piracy, use of the seas to conduct crimes, illicit trafficking in narcotics, psychotropic substances, people and firearms, and illegal and unregulated fishing. These issues have implications for the livelihood and security of coastal communities, international trade and energy security, officials said. On August 18, external affairs minister S Jaishankar will chair an open debate of the Security Council on using technology to protect UN peacekeeping troops. The theme for the event will be “Protecting the protectors”, and it will focus on ways to ensure the safety of peacekeepers by using technology and bringing to justice the perpetrators of crimes against peacekeepers. India has, over the years, contributed more than 250,000 troops to nearly 50 peacekeeping missions around the world. A total of 175 Indian troops have been killed during these missions. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, India upgraded two peacekeeping hospitals in South Sudan and Congo at the request of the UN secretary-general and donated Covid-19 vaccines for peacekeepers. Jaishankar will also chair a Security Council briefing on counter-terrorism on August 19 to discuss the UN secretary-general’s report on the Islamic State.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-host-events-on-terror-maritime-security-during-unsc-presidency-101628181655299.html

05-08-2021||India||Australian trade envoy Tony Abbott meets PM Modi, bilateral trade ties on agenda||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Australia’s special trade envoy Tony Abbott on Thursday discussed ways to strengthen bilateral trade, investment and economic cooperation in order to help both sides address challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. The former Australian premier is visiting the country during August 2-6 as Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s special trade envoy for India. Abbott is expected to focus on reviving negotiations for a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), which have been stalled for more than five years. The external affairs ministry said Modi and Abbott discussed ways to strengthen bilateral trade, investment and economic cooperation to realise the full potential of the bilateral comprehensive strategic partnership, which was forged during a virtual summit in June last year. “They emphasized that enhanced economic cooperation between India and Australia would help both countries better address the economic challenges emerging out of the Covid-19 pandemic, and would also help them in realising their shared vision of a stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region,” the ministry said in a statement. Modi also referred to the “stellar growth” of bilateral ties in recent times and reiterated his desire to host Morrison in India as soon as conditions permit. Abbott is meeting Indian ministers, business leaders and think tanks during his visit to take forward economic ties. During last year’s virtual summit, the bilateral relationship was elevated to a comprehensive strategic partnership, under which the two countries committed to encourage expanded trade and investment flows and to re-engage on negotiations for CECA. India and Australia held nine rounds of negotiations on CECA between May 2011 and September 2015. India and Australia also upgraded their 2+2 foreign affairs and defence dialogue to the ministerial level at the virtual summit and signed seven agreements focused on crucial areas such as defence and rare earth minerals, including the Mutual Logistics Support Agreement that will facilitate reciprocal access to military logistics facilities, allow more complex military exercises and improve interoperability between the armed forces of the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/australian-trade-envoy-tony-abbott-meets-pm-modi-bilateral-trade-ties-on-agenda-101628178773954.html

Chandrasekhar said that the government is aware that certain social media users create hate and ill-will among people. He expressed the belief that no social media platform or any other intermediary can destroy India's democracy.“Indian democracy has its bedrock in its Constitution and constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights for every citizen. No social media platform or any other intermediary can destroy our democracy,” the Union minister said.“The government receives various grievances from users about hate content on social media platforms and responds to them in an appropriate way,” Chandrasekhar said adding that the government issues advisories to social media intermediaries regularly to ensure safety and accountability.Chandrasekhar also stressed that social media companies have to follow the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, and Rules but maintained that the government aims to ensure ‘free, fair, open and trusted Internet’. He said the government wants to build an enabling and investor-friendly policies and environment in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-plans-to-block-any-social-media-platform-parliament-told-101628176237978.html
05-08-2021||India||Mixing of vaccines could tackle shortage but more studies needed, says Dr Kang||Dr Gagandeep Kang on Thursday said that the vaccine shortage could be tackled if Covid-19 vaccines doses are mixed in India. The microbiologist and virologist while speaking to news agency ANI said that several studies are being conducted on this across the world.Kang is a professor at the Christian Medical College (CMC) which has recently received the Subject Expert Committee’s permission to start trials for mixing of Covishield and Covaxin. She also pointed out that studies on mixing viral vector vaccines and mRNA vaccines have shown that the immune system becomes better if vaccines are mixed. Recently, Sputnik V and AstraZeneca vaccines were administered to patients with no cases showing any serious illness.“The most important thing is that we have been seeing vaccine shortages and people having to wait at vaccination centres, disappointed when they don’t get the second dose. The advantage is knowing that you can give any vaccine. It is good for the programme and good for people. It doesn’t matter which vaccine you get, you know that your chances of being protected are very high,” Kang said while speaking to news agency ANI.Kang said that along with the CMC other institutions should also begin research on this issue since more studies are needed to understand if mixing of vaccines can be effective in battling Covid-19.Kang also suggested that schools should be opened in a phased manner with vaccinated teachers and staff but also said that Covid-19 preventative measures should be followed. She said that children with comorbidities should be vaccinated as well.Speaking of a probable third wave, Kang said that the severity of it will depend on the variants and strains. “I think a lot depends on whether the wave is driven by variants, or driven by strains. If it's driven by variants then it becomes very difficult to predict what the numbers are likely to be,” Kang said.(with inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mixing-of-vaccines-could-tackle-shortage-but-more-studies-needed-says-dr-kang-101628174982205.html
05-08-2021||India||Madras high court raps Dhanush over Rolls Royce tax, says, 'Even a milk vendor...'||The Madras high court on Thursday rapped actor Dhanush over his earlier petition in which he sought exemption from entry tax on his imported Rolls Royce. Directing Dhanush to pay ₹30.30 lakh within 48 hours, Justice SM Subramaniam said those who are earning less than celebrities like Dhanush are paying taxes and do not knock at the door of the judiciary for relief. "You drive the luxury car on the roads laid using the taxpayers' money. Even a milk vendor and a daily wage labourer are paying taxes for every litre of petrol they buy," the judge said. The same judge had earlier rapped actor Vijay who had moved the court against levy of entry tax for his imported Rolls Royce Ghost.In 2015, Dhanush had imported his Rolls Royce Ghost for ₹2.15 crore from England. A regional transport officer directed him to obtain a no-objection certificate from the tax department before getting the car registered. As Dhanush moved the department for the NOC, the department asked him to pay ₹60.66 lakh as entry tax. Then the actor moved the court against the department's demand of entry tax. At that time, the court had passed an interim order asking the RTO to issue an NOC only if the actor pays 50 per cent on the said tax amount within 14 days.The case again came to the fore as Dhanush's counsel wanted to withdraw the petition of 2015 and said the actor was ready to pay the remainder of the tax. The court on Thursday did not allow the petition to be withdrawn and said, "If your intentions are genuine, you should have paid the tax at least after the Supreme Court settled the issue in 2018. Now after the high court listed the matter for orders, you are seeking to withdraw.""No doubt that it is your right to move the court. But you should have paid the tax and withdrawn the petition at least after the apex court had settled the issue in 2018," the court added.Cars imported several years back are plying on the roads without paying entry tax to the state, the court observed. Terming this as an issue of public interest, the court said it is of the opinion that the constitutional perspectives and the manner in which the writ petitions are filed are to be dealt with for the interest of protecting the rights of the citizens, who are all approaching this Court for redressal of their genuine grievance"...reminding the fundamental duty of the citizen is the Constitutional duty of the High Court... this Court thought it fit to pass orders, making the citizen aware, for the benefit of the public at large and to remind that the citizens are bound to respect the fundamental duties enunciated under the Constitution of India," the court said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-raps-dhanush-over-rolls-royce-tax-says-even-a-milk-vendor-101628175608166.html
05-08-2021||India||India’s economic growth may drop to 6% due to Covid-19, says Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee||Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee, who heads the Global Advisory Board set up by the Mamata Banerjee-administration to advise the West Bengal government on pandemic issues, on Thursday said that the country’s economic growth may drop to as low as 6% due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. “The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cut its economic growth forecast for India from 12.5% to 9.5% for the fiscal year to March 31, 2022. But I suspect it may drop to 6% to 7% at the end. I can’t give it in writing. But if another wave hits it may drop further. I hope it doesn’t happen,” he said. The Indian-American economist, who won the 2019 Nobel Prize in Economics, along with Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer was speaking to the media at the state secretariat after attending a meeting of the GAB to discuss the impending third wave of Covid-19. He also criticized the Narendra Modi-government at the Centre over rising fuel prices saying that the government should have been more open-handed with their spending during the pandemic. “The Union government has a fiscal problem. The government is trying to use this one instrument it has, given the fact that other forms of tax collection are not keeping pace because economy has slowed down. It is using this to balance the budget. This a moment in which the government should have been more open handed with their spending. The Centre is too unwilling to do what the US and European countries are doing which is printing money and spending it. That would have been a better policy in the current context particularly when we are not avoiding inflation. Being less mindful of the strategy would have been the right strategy now.” Swarup Sarkar, former regional director of WHO (World Health Organisation); Tom Frieden, ex-CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the US); Jishnu Das, economist, World Bank; and JVR Prasad Rao, a former union health secretary, were among the other experts along with senior health experts and doctors from the state. “It will not be possible to check another wave of Covid-19 till the time 80%-90% of the citizens are vaccinated. Till then chances are high that mutant variants of the virus would continue to surface. Government figures suggest that it won’t be possible to vaccinate 80%-90% of the people before June 2022. Till then we need to continue other preventive measures,” said Sarkar, who joined the meeting virtually. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over inadequate supply of vaccines to West Bengal. She wrote that the Centre was discriminating while supplying vaccines and BJP-ruled states like Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh were getting more vaccines. “I don’t follow the numbers (of vaccines being provided by the Centre to the states). My sense is the biggest problem is that the Centre is not capable of generating the supply of vaccines needed for the whole country. If there were enough vaccines, may be all these claims and counter claims wouldn’t arise. I think the core problem is that we have not reached the promised level of supply for the entire nation,” Abhijit Banerjee said when asked to comment on the Centre’s alleged discrimination. He, however, lauded the state government for effectively using vaccines provided to it with negative wastage. “This is worth emphasizing. The work they are doing is excellent,” he said. Even though the daily cases of Covid-19 dropped to 575 on Monday, the number of fresh cases shot up to 729 on Tuesday. On Wednesday, West Bengal reported 826 new cases. At least 10 people died on Wednesday. The daily count had crossed the 20,000 mark in mid-May soon after the assembly polls in the state. On Wednesday, the Centre wrote to all states to actively consider imposing local restrictions in public observation of occasions like Muharram, Onam, Janmashtami, Ganesh Chaturthi and Durga Puja. These occasions are lined up from August to October starting with Muharram on August 19, Janmashtami on August 30, Ganesh Chaturthi on September 10 and Durga Puja between October 5 and October 15. The West Bengal government is planning to reopen schools and colleges, on alternate days, after the puja vacation in November, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday after a meeting with the GAB. Reacting to the Nobel laureate’s remark, former chief economic adviser to the Union government and currently a BJP legislator Ashok Kumar Lahiri said, “Only time will decide the GDP growth. The NSSO follows a particular model while coming up with estimates. One has to go through the details to know what is happening. I haven’t gone through it. On GDP growth I hope Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee is wrong. Even if we don’t achieve 12%, it should be around 10%,” said Lahiri. “People ask for three things - the government should spend more, tax less and borrow less. All three cannot be done. If the government had taxed the fuel less, then one of the two things would have happened. Either expenditure had to be curtailed or the government would have had to borrow more. But there are people who say that inflation is slightly worrying. To compare India with US and European countries may not be the right thing to do. Inflation expectations are different in India, US and UK. International oil prices will not remain the same. So, there could be some relief,” said Lahiri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-economic-growth-may-drop-to-6-due-to-covid-19-says-nobel-laureate-abhijit-banerjee-101628175714019.html

The central government’s team, which recently visited the state to assess the Covid-19 situation, submitted its report and suggested that testing, contract tracing and containment measures need to be enhanced to deal with the spike in infections.On Wednesday, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya spoke to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan regarding the ongoing health crisis. Madaviya also wrote a letter to Vijayan where he said the state government should opt for more proactive measures and precautions to curb the spread of the viral disease.Despite the pandemic situation remaining serious, the state government eased its ongoing Covid-19 restrictions from Thursday morning. Shops, markets, offices and other establishments are now allowed to open six days a week. Shops can now function from 7 am to 9 pm but it is compulsory for staff and visitors to be inoculated with at least the first dose of the vaccine or prove that they tested negative after undergoing an RT-PCR test.However, restaurants and hotels are only allowed to deliver food and schools, colleges and other educational institutions and movie theatres will remain closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-records-22-040-new-covid-19-cases-test-positivity-rate-at-1349-101628174842647.html

The bill sought to amend the constitutional list of Scheduled Tribes as recommended by Arunachal Pradesh.Union minister Arjun Munda said that the bill will do justice to tribal communities. Munda said that there are 18 communities with their synonyms appearing in the illustrative list of Scheduled Tribes in respect of the state of Arunachal Pradesh. The bill provides for the deletion of Abor tribe from Serial No. 1 as it is the same as Adi in serial no. 16. It also proposed to replace Tai Khamti instead of Khampti at serial no 6 in the list. Nocte, Tangsa, Tutsa and Wancho tribes were also included in the list under serial No. 10 of the the list in lieu of any Naga tribes.The bill provides for modifying Part-XVIII of the Schedule to the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order, 1950, relating to the state of Arunachal Pradesh. The government said that the amendment in the list of Scheduled Tribes will not lead to any additional recurring expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India on account of benefits which are likely to be provided to persons belonging to the communities proposed in the bill. Parliamentarians Banda Prakash (TRS), M Thambidurai (AIADMK), K Somaprasad (CPI-M), Fauzia Khan (NCP), Manoj Jha (RJD) and SK Gupta (AAP) spoke briefly on the bill and extended their support to it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-passed-in-rajya-sabha-to-amend-scheduled-tribes-list-related-to-arunachal-101628173764538.html
05-08-2021||India||At UNSC meet under Indian presidency on Aug 6, focus is halting Taliban campaign||NEW DELHI: The UN Security Council meeting on Afghanistan to be held under the Indian presidency on August 6 is expected to focus on stopping the Taliban’s campaign of violence and attacks and ways to take forward the stalled Afghan peace process. TS Tirumurti, India’s ambassador to the UN announced the meeting, which will consist of a briefing and consultations on the latest developments in Afghanistan, in a tweet on Thursday. India holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council for August.The move came two days after Afghan foreign minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar called his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on Tuesday and sought an emergency session of the Security Council to discuss ways to halt the Taliban’s violence and atrocities across Afghanistan. “UN #SecurityCouncil will meet on Friday, 6th August, under Indian Presidency to discuss and take stock of the situation in #Afghanistan,” Tirumurti tweeted. The meeting was convened following consultations with the five permanent and nine other non-permanent members of the Security Council, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The Afghan side expects the meeting to focus on the Taliban’s violation of commitments under the 2020 agreement with the US with the group’s ongoing campaign of violence and attacks, and ways to give a nudge to the Afghan peace process that has been stalled for months, the people said.“There is a need for pressure on the Taliban and their sponsors to reduce the violence. It is clear who is backing the violence and supporting the Taliban,” one of the people cited above said.“Also, there is no tangible progress in the peace process because of the Taliban’s intransigence. It is costing Afghanistan in terms of lives, infrastructure, revenues and the gains made in the past 20 years,” the person added. Though there was some talk of a possible resolution on the situation and the Taliban violence, the people said this might not be among the outcomes of the meeting. While Afghanistan’s partners will try to pressure the Taliban and its supporters in Pakistan, the feeling is that China, a permanent member of the Security Council, will step in to counter any move that is critical of Pakistan.Avinash Paliwal, associate professor in the department of politics and international studies at SOAS University, said: “The UN Security Council has its own dynamics, but to have India as president at this point in time is the last thing Islamabad and the Taliban would have wanted. There will be a lot of ‘stock-taking’ in the coming weeks and the Taliban won’t like most of it.” Afghan ambassador Farid Mamundzay welcomed the meeting and thanked India for playing a “lead role as UNSC President”.“Convening an emergency UN Security Council Session on Afghanistan is a positive development. UN & international community must play a greater role to stop the unfolding tragedy in [Afghanistan] due to violence & atrocities by terrorists,” Mamundzay tweeted. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India will share its vision and perspectives on Afghanistan during the meeting. “We look forward to productive deliberations on this issue,” he told a regular news briefing.“We are closely monitoring the evolving security situation in Afghanistan and we continue to call for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire,” he added. Atmar’s phone call to Jaishankar on Tuesday coincided with an attack by a team of Taliban suicide attackers on the residence of defence minister Bismillah Mohammadi in Kabul. The attack triggered an intense hours-long clash between the attackers and security forces that left eight people dead and 20 more injured.

Only after the approval of the CDL, these batches are released commercially, the company said on Thursday issuing a statement in the wake of quality concerns of the vaccine. In a recent interview, the chief of National Immunisation Technical Advisory Group, Dr NK Arora, said the initial batches of Covaxin, produced at the new plant of the company in Bengaluru were not satisfactory level. While he was explaining why there was a delay in getting the expected number of doses from Bharat Biotech, his statement was misinterpreted and concerns were raised over the quality of the initial batches of Covaxin. Later, it was clarified that those batches were never released and now Bharat Biotech too has issued a statement."As of date, all batches of Covaxin are manufactured and released only from our manufacturing facilities at Genome Valley Hyderabad, which are fully audited and approved by regulatory authorities, hence we wish to put to rest any concerns on the quality of Covaxin," the company said adding that misleading narratives will create panic and result in vaccine hesitancy.Citing its credentials, the company said that it is "emblematic" that Bharat Biotech has not sought indemnity from the government for any adverse events from Covaxin. "The whole-virion Inactivated Vero Cell vaccines are highly complex to manufacture as the critical ingredient is based on live viruses which require highly sophisticated, multiple level containment and purification methods. Such extensive, high standards of purification naturally lead to significant process losses and low yields resulting in a highly purified and safe vaccine," the company said.On Thursday, Bharat Biotech received the Good Manufacturing Practices compliance certificate from Hungary marking the first certificate from a European regulator. The company has also submitted documents for emergency use approval in Canada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-200-tests-for-every-batch-bharat-biotech-on-covaxin-quality-concern-101628173667069.html
05-08-2021||India||Parliament passes bill to bar strikes in units providing essential defence services||The Parliament on Thursday passed a Bill that allows the government to prohibit strikes and lockouts in units providing essential defence services. The Essential Defence Services Bill, 2021, was cleared by Rajya Sabha after Lok Sabha passed it on August 3. It was introduced in the lower house on July 22 to replace an ordinance promulgated in June. The ordinance was issued after the Union Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, cleared the corporatisation of India’s main producer of weapons and military equipment, the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), to boost its efficiency and competitiveness in a long-awaited reform in the country’s defence manufacturing sector. The ordinance made it illegal for the employees of the OFB to go on strike. The factories controlled by the board employ at least 70,000 people who were against the move to corporatise it. Speaking in Rajya Sabha, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, “It is being said that the Bill denies the right to peaceful protest. I want to clarify that this bill does not, in any way, deny the right to peaceful protest… We want to improve the autonomy of the ordnance factories and increase their efficiency.” Essential defence services include units or undertakings involved in the production of goods or equipment required for defence. Also, the government can declare any service as an essential defence service if its termination affects the production of defence gear or maintenance of defence equipment. Under the bill, the government may prohibit strikes, lockouts and lay-offs to protect the country’s sovereignty and integrity. Those violating the prohibition order can be punished or fined, or both. The OFB, which controls 41 ordnance factories, will be split into seven government-owned entities that will produce ammunition and explosives, vehicles, weapons and equipment, troop comfort items, opto-electronics gear, parachutes and ancillary products. Ordnance factories are currently engaged in the production of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, mine-protected vehicles, bombs, rockets, artillery guns, anti-aircraft guns, parachutes, small arms, clothing and leather equipment for soldiers. Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said, “There are many precedents in this House and breaking all these precedents, new precedents are being set. The Bill brought by the defence minister is on the additional agenda and this was not supposed to come up today for discussion. But the way there is a ruckus in parliament… They are taking advantage of this situation... and they are getting this Bill passed in some way. This bill is very important. I request you (chair) to send it to a select committee where it will be reviewed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-passes-bill-to-bar-strikes-in-units-providing-essential-defence-services-101628173793800.html
05-08-2021||India||SC orders CBSE schools to release results committee’s evaluation for Class 10,12||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday told all schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to publish detailed results of Class 12 and 10 students tabulated by the Results Committee to enable students to decide if they should opt for the improvement exams to be held between August 15 and September 15.The top court’s direction came on a petition filed by the Association of Private Schools of Uttar Pradesh who sought early dates for holding the improvement examination and declaration of results, apart from directions to the CBSE to refund the ₹1,500 exam fee charged from each student since no examinations were held “On instructions, CBSE has submitted that it will issue instructions to all the schools registered under that Board to notify the internal assessment marks, highest average in the preceding three years and the marks assigned by the Result Committee on case to case basis. That shall be the responsibility of the concerned school(s) where the students are pursuing studies,” the bench said.The association earlier argued that students need to be told how their marks were reduced as a result of the moderation exercise conducted by the CBSE since the marks awarded to many students were much lower than the marks secured by them in internal examinations. This was due to the rationalization policy prescribed by CBSE which required the results committee to moderate marks in terms of the school’s best performance in the past three years.“Going by the newspaper reports, everybody has scored very high marks,” the bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna remarked.The bench noted that the CBSE has agreed to this request and will issue instructions to all schools to notify the marks assigned by the results committee on a case-to-case basis. “This shall be the responsibility of the concerned school where the students were pursuing their studies,” the order said.The two examination boards, CBSE and CISCE, submitted a tentative schedule for the improvement exams. The CBSE told the court that the results of the improvement examination will be declared by September 30, while the Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) plans to release the same around September 20.The association asked the two boards to consider announcing the results by September 20 due to college admissions and entrance examinations such as JEE, NEET. The court accepted the schedules provided by the two boards and refused to advance the dates.CBSE counsel Rupesh Kumar said the examination will be conducted for three categories of students; those who apply for correction of results through dispute resolution mechanism, compartment candidates, and private, correspondence or second chance compartment candidates. The option to register for the physical examination may be made available by August 10, he added.The two boards unequivocally objected to the demand of refunding the fee, underlining that they were “self-financing” bodies that did not receive any grant from the government. In separate affidavits, the boards said that examination fees of ₹1500 per student is the only means to pay their staff and finance the expenses for the examinations.The association argued that since the examinations stood canceled, there was no question of collecting the examination fee.“As per our estimates, CBSE has saved ₹200 crore by not holding a physical examination. This money can be either refunded or be used to finance mobile phones for poor students,” advocate Ravi Prakash Gupta, representing the association, said.The bench said, “We don’t need your suggestions. Tell us if you have a legal right to get a refund.” The judges agreed with the boards that the decision to cancel examinations was taken at the last minute and they are already made all the preparations for the exams by then.The results committee – comprising five members (for Class 12) and seven members (for Class 10) – set up this year for tabulating marks through internal assessment alone had cost CBSE around ₹40 crore on account of honorarium to the committee members, CBSE informed the court.CBSE controller of examinations Sanyam Bhardwaj also rebutted the association on refund of fee.“The respondent CBSE has not unjustly enriched itself by collecting examination fees which has and is being utilized by it for the purpose of conducting examination and also for the purpose of rendering various services (mark sheet, pass certificate) to students.” The CBSE will not be charging any additional fees for the students taking improvement examination,” Bhardwaj said in an affidavit.CBSE enrolled nearly 14.5 lakh students for Class 12 this year as compared to CISCE which had over one lakh students. After the government decided to cancel the examinations this year, the board came out with an evaluation scheme by which Class 12 students were to be assessed based on a 30:30:40 ratio. This formula took the best of three subject marks of Class X Boards (30 per cent), annual results of Class 11 (30 per cent) and Pre-Boards or internal assessment conducted during Class 12 (40 per cent).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-orders-cbse-schools-to-release-results-committee-s-evaluation-for-class-1012-101628170973600.html
05-08-2021||India||Modi govt moves Lok Sabha for Sindhu Central University in Ladakh||On the second anniversary of the creation of the union territory of Ladakh, the Narendra Modi government on Thursday introduced an amendment in the Central Universities Act, 2009, in Lok Sabha paving the way for Sindhu Central University to cater for higher education and intellectual growth. Costing ₹750 crore, the Sindhu university was approved by the Union Cabinet on July 22.The name of the university was given as Sindhu or Indus river after considerable deliberation under Home Minister Amit Shah as the government wanted a name that covered not only Ladakh but Ladakh and beyond as the map of the Ladakh UT incorporates Pakistan occupied Areas of Gilgit and Baltistan.Also Read: PM Modi gives Ladakh its first central university; will have a Centre on Buddhist StudiesIn his Independence Day address in 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced to establish a new Central University in the Union Territory of Ladakh, which inched a step closer to materialisation as the government introduced the amendment on Thursday.Sources in the know of the development confirmed that the Union Territory of Ladakh has identified approx 110 acres of land at village Khaltsi, located in between Leh and Kargil.According to top government sources, after the Home Ministry considered a number of names for the Central University including those of Ladakhi military leaders, Sindhu was found to be an apt name as the river rises in Tibet, passes through Ladakh, connects to Kargil through Suru tributary, flows through Gilgit-Baltistan in Occupied Northern Areas and then empties into the Arabian Sea near the port city of Karachi. The name Indus was not given as already a private university in that name is registered in Gujarat.The jurisdiction of the upcoming Sindhu University will cover the entire UT of Ladakh including Leh, Kargil, and beyond. These regions were left out of the jurisdiction of central universities in Jammu and Kashmir after the state was bifurcated into two union territories.A Budget provision of ₹750 crore will be required over the next seven years to meet the expenditure of setting up the university. Local administration and experts will be consulted before taking the final decision.But why a separate university instead of merging it with the existing university for Ladakh? Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Councils of Leh & Kargil are of the view that UT Ladakh should opt for a separate Central University rather than merging it with the existing University for Ladakh as around 4,000 students are estimated to be pursuing higher education outside Ladakh and having a Central University in Ladakh would provide them quality education within their UT."Students, Faculty members and their families from the rest of the country would be visiting Central University which will act as a catalyst for emotional integration of this region. The University will help in emotional integration of the country, and taking forward the concept of 'Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat' to the remotest corner of the country. It will also help in convincing the people of the UT of Ladakh that entire country is standing with them, especially at a time when China is trying to create mischief at our borders," said officials. Also, Jammu and Kashmir already has two Central universities, one each in Jammu and Srinagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-govt-moves-lok-sabha-for-sindhu-central-university-in-ladakh-101628168112507.html

Once the amendments are passed, there will be no incident like that of Cairn energy or Vodafone may take place."The Bill proposes to amend the Income-tax Act, 1961 so as to provide that no tax demand shall be raised in future on the basis of the said retrospective amendment for any indirect transfer of Indian assets if the transaction was undertaken before 28th May 2012 (i.e., the date on which the Finance Bill, 2012 received the assent of the President)," the finance ministry said in a statement.Also read: Govt weighs options as Cairn wins Paris assets"It is further proposed to provide that the demand raised for indirect transfer of Indian assets made before 28th May 2012 shall be nullified on fulfillment of specified conditions such as withdrawal or furnishing of undertaking for withdrawal of pending litigation and furnishing of an undertaking to the effect that no claim for cost, damages, interest, etc., shall be filed. It is also proposed to refund the amount paid in these cases without any interest thereon," the ministry stated.What is retrospective tax?This is a tax charged for transactions that took place in the past. The UPA government in 2012 imposed capital gains tax retrospectively on some companies like Cairn and Vodafone.The move comes India lost both the cases in the international tribunal in the Netherlands filed by both Cairn and Vodafone. In both cases, the court ruled that India must not make any more attempts to recover the "alleged tax liability or any interest and or penalties".Vodafone and Cairn casesCairn Energy, the British oil and gas company, is seeking to recover $1.2 billion from India while in the Vodafone case, the government has no liability.The country today stands at a juncture when quick recovery of the economy after the Covid-19 pandemic is the need of the hour and foreign investment has an important role to play in promoting faster economic growth and employment, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-amend-income-tax-act-no-provision-for-retrospective-tax-101628167762474.html

UP’s identity that was previously limited to politics, is changing now as big ticket infra projects, industries and investments have started coming to the state,” he said. After speaking with beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PM-GKAY) in Uttar Pradesh via video conferencing on Thursday, Modi showered praise on chief minister Yogi Adityanath, describing him both as “Yogi and Karmyogi (saint and doer)” while seeking the blessings of the common man to let him continue the work for “Dalits, backwards, the poor and the marginalised”. Under PM-GKAY, the state has provided free ration to an estimated 15 crore poor so far. “I am going to continue this scheme till Diwali,” the PM told one of the five beneficiaries shortlisted for interaction with him. Launching a statewide awareness campaign on the food security scheme, PM Modi said it was a matter of immense satisfaction that every grain sent to the state was reaching the beneficiaries.Also Read | ‘India is proud’: PM Modi congratulates India hockey team for bronze medal winAdityanath welcomed the Prime Minister from Ayodhya, reminding the PM that last year on the same date (August 5), he was in the temple town for the bhoomi pujan (foundation stone laying) function of the Ram temple and how his government was developing a “nayi Ayodhya (new Ayodhya).” Mentioning the significance of August 5, the PM referred to the scrapping of Article 370 two years ago on this day and the bhoomi pujan (foundation stone laying) function of the Ram temple in Ayodhya last year.He said, “The day has become even more significant with the men’s hockey team winning a medal in the Olympics after decades.” Referring to Covid-19 as a once-in-century pandemic, he said, “Can you even think what would have happened in UP had Covid-19 happened five years ago? But today, nearly 5.15 crore [51.5 million] vaccination doses have been given in the state.” Hitting out at the Opposition, he said, “Politics is changing...Ab pad nahi padak (Not post, medals), parivar nahi parisharm (not dynastic politics but hard work) is becoming the main criteria.”Apart from the Olympics, Modi also talked of an upcoming landmark of 500 milliion vaccination doses, record GST collection of ₹116,000 crore in July, signalling a new momentum in the economy.

In every case, the scenario will be different, the virologist said to news agency ANI.Variant and third waveIf the new wave is driven by new variants, it will be difficult to predict the number of cases, Dr Kang said. Many experts have earlier said that Covid's third wave is unlikely to be as severe as that of the first and the second as the vaccine coverage will play a significant role."If it's driven by strains then we know numbers are likely to be low," Dr Kang said adding that if the new variants are more infectious, then cases can increase at the same pace as the first wave.Also Read | Number of waves doesn't matter: What experts say on Covid 3rd wave in IndiaSeasonal element and third waveThe SARS-CoV-2 virus is somewhat dependent on the environment, the virologist said. "We know that this is a virus that is dependent on the environment and I think what we are seeing from certain other parts of the world is that there may be some seasonal elements to this virus. We have to get through another winter and see that how that plays out, in determining how much we see and when," Dr Kang said.Transmission of disease and third waveExplaining how replication of the virus is linked with the emergence of a new variant and thereby responsible for a new wave, Dr Kang said as long as the virus is replicating, the chances of a new variant emerging remain high. To stop the virus from replication, the transmission of the infection has to be stopped as replication takes place in the human host."..if we want to prevent the emergence of a new variant, we also have to prevent transmission of the disease because any amount of replication will continue to be a threat. That is what we are seeing with delta. Newer variants are able to infect people who have been vaccinated," Dr Kang said.Calling for layered intervention, which involves many aspects, the virologist said that apart from Covid-appropriate behaviour, one should ensure staying at fully ventilated places, avoiding crowded areas etc.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-variant-of-covid-will-emerge-as-long-as-virologist-gagandeep-kang-on-3rd-wave-threat-101628163017781.html

05-08-2021||India||Govt targeting Oppn leaders to suppress their voices in Parliament: Kharge||On Thursday, leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that the government is targeting Opposition leaders to suppress their voices in the House.“The Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders, who were suspended yesterday [Wednesday], were just reminding the Chair about the issues. If they are trying to target us, threaten us, or put pressure on us to crush our voice and issues, Congress and other parties in the Opposition won’t bow down. We will continue our fight,” said Kharge at a press conference.On Wednesday, six TMC MPs --Dola Sen, Md. Nadimul Haque, Abir Ranjan Biswas, Shanta Chhetri, Arpita Ghosh, Mausam Noor-- were suspended from the Rajya Sabha after they entered the Well of the House with placards, shouting slogans. The MPs were protesting the Pegasus snooping row, the contentious farm laws and spiraling fuel prices. Also Read | Records on lawful interception destroyed regularly: Govt in Rajya SabhaKharge asked the government why it has not ordered an inquiry into the Pegasus row when countries like France and Israel have already started an investigation. “ What are you (government) afraid of that you don’t want an investigation or a discussion in the House?” asked Kharge.He also refuted the government’s claim that the Opposition is not allowing the Parliament to function and is refusing to discuss issues. Kharge said that the Opposition has not received any notice indicating the government’s intention to discuss the Pegasus row, inflation and farm laws. He also pointed out that during the United Progressive Alliance regime, the BJP had caused the most disruptions.The BJP, however, reiterated that it is the Opposition which is not allowing the Parliament to function, and accused them of not following the parliamentary procedures. “The main function of the Parliament is to discuss, debate and deliberate on Bills. The Opposition’s behaviour is creating a situation where legislation is becoming more and more difficult, as a result debate is not taking place,” said BJP spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal.Responding to criticism about passing 10 Bills under 97 minutes, the BJP spokesperson said that it is the government’s responsibility to legislate and come up with laws for the benefit of the public.Kharge’s press conference comes a day after 14 Opposition partiess signed a joint letter toughening their stand on the Pegasus issue, alleging that the Centre is attempting to divide the Opposition’s unity.The Opposition has also said that discussions on farmers’ agitations due to the three anti-farmer laws should follow the discussion on Pegasus. Aam Aadmi Party, which skipped a meeting of most Opposition parties on Tuesday, also signed the statement.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday called for Opposition unity, underlining that the more it is united the more difficult it will be for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to suppress their voices.The Opposition has been demanding a clarification from the government on the allegations of surveillance. The government earlier responded by saying that the Opposition was making “an issue out of a non-issue” and not allowing the Parliament to function.The government has neither confirmed nor denied whether it has purchased the spyware. NSO Group has on multiple occasions said that it offers services only to vetted government clients. The company has disputed the leaked list of numbers as those targeted by its clients.The list database was first obtained by France-based non-profit Forbidden Stories, which shared the information with the reporting partners. The devices of at least 67 of the numbers were analysed by Amnesty International and of these, 37 had signs of being hacked by Pegasus. Of these 37, 10 were in India.To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation explains, the presence of a number does not indicate the individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-targeting-oppn-leaders-to-suppress-their-voices-in-parliament-kharge-101628162393073.html

The victims were rushed to the Murshidabad Medical College and Hospital where their condition was stated to be critical. Locals said that a group of labourers from Nabagram in Murshidabad were boarding a truck parked on the roadside on NH34. They were scheduled to go to Berhampore to work at a construction site, when the accident occured. “A truck, which was travelling at high-speed suddenly swerved and hit the lorry, which was parked on the NH-34, from behind. The driver then tried to flee. Some of the victims were dragged along with the vehicle for a few feet before it came to a halt. The driver then escaped,” said Bulu Sheikh, an eye-witness. According to the police, the deceased have been identified as Subhankar Mondal, 45, Joy Mondal, 45, Raju Mondal, 42 and Rubel Sheikh, 39. Rubel was the driver of the truck, which was parked.

The plea comes as India’s indigenous vaccine Covaxin is yet to be recognised in Saudi Arabia.The petitioner has already been inoculated with both shots of Covaxin.In the early half of last month, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan said that Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is likely to receive a nod for emergency use from the public health agency in the next four to six weeks – potentially by August 21.“There is a process to be followed for approval. Companies have to submit their safety data, complete trial data, and even manufacturing quality data for approval,” she further said, adding that Bharat Biotech has already begun submitting the data and the dossier is being assessed.“It is the next vaccine to be reviewed by our committee. There will be a decision on inclusion in the next four to six weeks,” Dr Swaminathan said during a webinar on worldwide vaccine access.Also Read | WHO approval to Covaxin likely in 4-6 weeks, says chief scientistIn a separate interview last month as well, Dr Swaminathan said that the Phase 3 clinical trial data of Covaxin “looks good” and meets the safety profile of the international public health agency so far.Covaxin has till now received approval for emergency use authorization in as many as 16 nations, including Iran, the Philippines, Estonia and Brazil.A recent study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research revealed that Covaxin is effective against the Delta variant, one of the “variants of concerns” that has now spread to more than 120 countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-expat-files-plea-to-kerala-hc-to-get-re-vaccinated-with-covishield-101628160463833.html

It is worth pointing out that whereas before August 2019 New Delhi would argue that Kashmir was the main trouble spot in the state, today it is faced with four trouble spots of Leh, Kargil and Jammu as there is disaffection in these regions too,” the statement claimed.Also Read | Two years since Article 370 abrogation: Mehbooba Mufti leads protest in SrinagarAPHC chairperson Mirwaiz Umar Farooq has been in house detention since the 2019 move.

APHC urges the government of India to resume engagement with the Government of Pakistan,” the statement said.It said APHC has had a long-standing policy of engagement in meaningful dialogue among all the stakeholders that sees the situation on the ground for what it is, and encourages dialogue rather than armed confrontation.“The latter benefits no one and harms everyone. Nor is intransigence and denial a helpful stance. All political prisoners, including APHC chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq , hundreds of youth and all others arrested arbitrarily or under draconian laws should be released by the government,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-years-of-article-370-abrogation-move-complicated-j-k-issue-says-hurriyat-101628161972815.html

Such records are not being maintained by MHA,” the minister said.Gazette of India notification dated February 4, 2014 also suggests an amendment to the Indian Telegraph Act. Subrule 14 under the above mentioned notification says, “records pertaining to such directions for interception and of intercepted messages shall be destroyed by the relevant competent authority and the authorised security and law enforcement Agencies, every six months unless these are, or likely to be, required for the functional requirement.”Meanwhile, minister Chauhan added there were provisions for the government as per Indian Telegraph Act’s Section 5(2) and Information Technology Act’s Section 69 to intercept phones “lawfully.”“As per both these Rules, for approving interception, Union Home Secretary is the Competent Authority in case of Central Government and Secretary in charge of Home Department in case of States/UTs,” the minister added.The Opposition has been demanding a clarification from the government on the allegations of surveillance.

05-08-2021||India||Covishield dose gap may again be reduced, but only for people above 45||The government may again reduce the gap between the two doses of the Covishield vaccine, but this time it will only be for those 45 years and older, Mint reported. The decision may be taken in two to four weeks, Covid-19 working group chairman Dr NK Arora has said in an interview. The decision will be based on final scientific evidence.The present gap between the doses of Covishield is 12 to 16 weeks for all adults. At the very beginning of the vaccination drive in India, the recommended gap between the two doses of Covishield was 4-6 weeks, which was increased to 4 to 8 weeks and then finally to 12 to 16 weeks.The decision to increase the gap to 12 to 16 weeks met criticism as the move was interpreted as an attempt to manage the vaccine scarcity in the country at that time. Experts, however, asserted that the decision was based on the emerging international scientific studies, according to which a longer gap between the doses generated more antibodies. In these studies, it was found that the percentage of antibodies produced by the first shot of the vaccine is quite high. Hence, the next shot should be delayed allowing the first shot more time to work. Also Read | Indian students abroad: Adar Poonawalla donates ₹10 cr for quarantine facilityBut soon after, India increased the gap between the two doses in June, new studies claimed that the effectiveness of the first shot of Covishield was overestimated earlier. This again followed a reduction in the gap of the two doses of Covishield in many countries. Indian experts have reiterated that the vaccination situation is dynamic and will change as new studies will emerge, but public health will get paramount importance in whatever decision is taken.As Covishield is the same as the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, international studies are available regarding the efficacy of each dose. Now, in India too, there are many studies on the effectiveness of the doses on the local population. “We have gathered data on the impact of vaccines and their dosage interval on different age groups and from different regions," Dr NK Arora has said.While senior citizens are considered the most vulnerable to Covid, the age group between 45 and 60 is also at a greater risk than the rest of the population and the presence of co-morbidity factors may increase the risk.When the government extended the gap between the doses of Covishield, it allowed some exemption to sportspersons going to represent India at the Olympics, individuals going abroad for studies, job etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-dose-gap-may-again-be-reduced-but-only-for-people-above-45-101628159052941.html
05-08-2021||India||Man held for bursting crackers, being abusive outside Olympian Vandana Kataria’s house||The Uttarakhand police registered a case on Thursday against two men and some unknown persons for allegedly abusing and provoking Team India hockey player Vandana Kataria’s family in Haridwar a day earlier. Based on the complaint of Vandana’s brother Chandrashekhar Kataria, they have filed a case against Vijaypal, a resident of Roshanabad and Sumit Chauhan, a resident of Navodaya Nagar and some unknown people under relevant sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, and Section 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) of the Indian Penal Code, station house officer Lakhpat Butola said. “Vijaypal has been arrested while a manhunt is on to nab the other accused,” he said. “They hurled abusive remarks, blamed Vandana and Dalit players for being responsible for the defeat. When we protested they used more abusive language and made fun of us for being Dalits. Our family is in deep shock at a time when the whole country is feeling proud of Vandana’s ability and achievement,” said Chandrashekhar Kataria, Vandana’s brother. .Kataria said targeting a player and her family on grounds of belonging to a Scheduled Caste is totally uncalled for. “We are content that the SSP and respective police officials took prompt action and arrested one accused---Vijaypal from Roshanabad stadium today,” he said. Vandana’s family had earlier complained to Senior Superintendent of Haridwar, D Senthil Aboodai Krishan S, regarding foul, abusive and caste-based remarks made by their neighbours against them and Vandana on Wednesday. Just as the semi-final match at Tokyo Olympics between India and Argentina got over on Wednesday, which India lost, some anti-social elements burst firecrackers and made abusive remarks outside Vandana Kataria’s house in Haridwar. The incident took place at Aurangabad village near Roshnabad, about 14 km from Haridwar city.According to the police, Vandana’s neighbours have been at loggerheads with the Kataria family for the past few years due to a dispute. Savita Kataria, the Olympian’s sister-in-law had even threatened to die by suicide on Wednesday if immediate legal action was not taken against the culprits. Dalit leader and legislator from Jwalapur Suresh Rathore condemned the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-held-for-bursting-crackers-being-abusive-outside-olympian-vandana-kataria-s-house-101628159453201.html
05-08-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi says Pegasus meant to silence India’s youth at 'Sansad gherao' stir||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the ongoing Pegasus hacking controversy stating the Israeli spying software was used as a tool to silence the country’s youth. Gandhi said the Modi government has put Pegasus inside the phones of the youth.Addressing a ‘Sansad Gehrao’ protest organised by the Youth Congress in Delhi, Gandhi said, “Brothers and sisters please remember, your mobile phone is your voice. You can express whatever you want through this mobile phone. You have to understand that Narendra Modi has put Pegasus inside your phones. Not only inside my phone. The idea of Pegasus has been inserted into the phones of the youth by Modi.”Speaking further on software, the Congress leader said if the country’s youth speak the truth, then the Prime Minister will be present inside their phones.Meanwhile, police said no permission was given for Thursday’s protest and about 600 people, including lawmakers, were detained. “A total of 589 people, including 28 women, two MPs and two MLAs, were detained during the protest carried out by Indian Youth Congress. No permission to carry out the protest march was given to the organiser, IYC president Srinivas BV,” New Delhi DCP Deepak Yadav was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Police used water cannons to disperse the Youth Congress workers staging the protest at Raisina road. A traffic snarl also ensued at Ashok Road and other parts of central Delhi due to the stir.The Congress has been leading the Opposition’s charge against the Centre over the snooping scandal. Earlier, Gandhi had accused Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah of using Pegasus against India, its institutions and its democracy. He had also demanded a Supreme Court-monitored investigation into the matter and Shah’s resignation as the home minister.The hacking controversy came into light two weeks ago after an international investigative consortium stated that several Indian, including ministers, Opposition leaders, journalists and businessmen, were potential targets of Israeli firm NSO Group’s phone hacking software called Pegasus.The monsoon session of Parliament has been rocked by protests from opposition parties against the alleged surveillance of the country’s citizens. On Wednesday, 14 parliamentarians from the Opposition demanded an open discussion on the issue in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and said the issue has ramifications on India’s security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-says-pegasus-meant-to-silence-india-s-youth-at-sansad-gherao-stir-101628155448464.html
05-08-2021||India||Sexual assault between thighs also rape, rules Kerala high court||A division bench of the Kerala high court has expanded the definition of rape and said non-penetrative sexual act between the thighs of a victim to produce a sensation akin to penetration will also de defined as rape, news agency PTI reported."...when the body of the victim is manipulated to hold the legs together for the purpose of simulating a sensation akin to penetration of an orifice; the offence of rape is attracted. When penetration is thus made in between the thighs so held together, it would certainly amount to "rape" as defined under Section 375," a bench of Justices K Vinod Chandran and Ziyad Rahman has recently ruled in a landmark verdict.The bench was hearing an appeal of a man against a trial court verdict involving a case where he repeatedly assaulted a minor girl in his neighbourhood sexually. He was sentenced to life by the trial court against which the man moved the high court. The sexual act which was alleged in this case was that of penetration between the thighs of the victim."In short, considering the intention of the legislature as revealed from the above proposals, followed by the enactment of Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2013 and gradual evolution of the concept of the offence of "rape" from time to time, the irresistible conclusion is that, the definition of rape as contained in section 375 would take in, all forms of penetrative sexual assault onto vagina, urethra, anus or any other parts of the body so manipulated to get the feeling or sensation of an orifice," the court said.Also read: Supreme Court rejects pleas by rape survivor, convict to marry each other"We have already found that Section 375 as amended by Act 13 of 2013, widened the definition of "rape" by expanding its ambit beyond the penile penetrative assault into vagina. One of the consequences of such amendment is that, several penetrative sexual assaults, which would otherwise be triable under Section 377, now come within the operative field of Section 375", the court said.As stated in the court order, the case dates back to 2015 when a medical camp was conducted in Thirumarady Government School. The victim appeared along with her mother with the complaint of stomach pain. During the medical examination, the victim was sexually assaulted by a neighbour. The doctor had informed the mother and asked her to make a police complaint. The case then went over which section of the IPC will be imposed and whether the assault will be considered rape."As the provision stands at present in 375(c) what constitutes rape reads as: (c) manipulates any part of the body of a woman so as to cause penetration into the vagina, urethra, anus or any part of body of such woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person; or”. It includes penetration to other parts of the body of woman and it is not confined to vagina, urethra and anus," the order said."The word penetration means: “a movement into or through something or some one” The word, 'penetrate', as per The Concise Oxford Dictionary, means 'the act or process of making way into or through something'; 'to enter or pass through or force a way into or through'. When the above provision is read with the said definitions in common parlance, we have no doubt in our mind that, when the body of the victim is manipulated to hold the legs together for the purpose of simulating a sensation akin to penetration of an orifice; the offence of rape is attracted," it said."We are of the view that such an interpretation is in tune with the intention of the legislature which rose to the need of the hour; the society having been confronted with increasing number of such incidents of sexual assault on a routine basis. The time has come for more stringent provisions with increasing instances of acts of such depravity both as a measure of prevention and retribution," it added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sexual-assault-between-thighs-also-rape-rules-kerala-high-court-101628155058726.html

The incident took place on Wednesday after the Upper House was adjourned for the day.“One of the MPs who was earlier suspended for the day tried to enter the Rajya Sabha chamber. On being stopped by the security staff, the MP broke the glass of one of the doors in the inner lobby. A lady security officer was hit by a glass piece and injured.

The MPs were protesting the Pegasus snooping row, the contentious farm laws and spiraling fuel prices.Trinamool MP Sukhendu Sekhar Ray defended the MP. He said the lawmakers had returned to the House after it was adjourned for the day to collect their bags but the security staff did not allow them to enter.He said, “The glass broke in the commotion.

It is part of the democratic way. Even late BJP leader Arun Jaitley said disruption is part of democracy…Yesterday [Wednesday], they had returned to collect their bags and papers after the House was adjourned for the day,” Kharge said.The Opposition uproar over the matter and protests against the snooping row and the contentious farm laws led to three adjournments in the pre-lunch session. Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who is also the deputy leader of the House, said, “No one has any problem with protesting, but there is a problem with violence and the way the security staff was manhandled.”Last week, Naidu warned the MPs that action could be taken against those not following decorum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-uproar-in-rs-after-dy-chairman-condemns-suspended-tmc-mp-s-behaviour-101628154413551.html

Launching a statewide awareness campaign on the food security scheme, Modi said it is a matter of immense satisfaction that every grain sent to the state is reaching the beneficiaries.The awareness programme is meant to ensure that no beneficiary is left out from availing the benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana. “The way Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana is being implemented in the state defines the new Uttar Pradesh,” he said, adding that during previous regimes, foodgrains meant for the poor were looted.Modi said for many years, UP has been viewed from a political lens, its prospects of playing a vital role in country's development were not even discussed. "But state's 'growth engine' potential has been promoted only in the last few years," he added.He said that after providing houses, toilets, electricity and gas, the government is working to provide water through pipelines to every household."Our government is trying to provide benefits of schemes to people cutting across all sections of society," said PM Modi.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath also attended the event.

The Opposition, however, accused the deputy chairman for “supporting the wrong narrative” of the incident.“A member of Rajya Sabha who was earlier suspended… tried to enter the Rajya Sabha chamber, and on being stopped by the security personnel, the member broke the glass of one of the doors of the lobby of the Rajya Sabha chamber… injuring a lady security officer... She has lodged a complaint... This is highly unbecoming and deplorable…” deputy chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh said.Also Read | Parliament: BJP hits out at Congress, says party doesn’t want serious discussionAn officer from Parliament Security Services (PSS) suffered minor injuries on Wednesday when Arpita Ghosh, one of the suspended Trinamool Congress MPs allegedly broke the glass pane of a wooden door in Rajya Sabha by smashing her mobile phone throught it in a bid to enter the Upper House, news agency ANI reported.Earlier on Wednesday, Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu suspended six Trinamool Congress MPs, including Ghosh, for entering the Well of the House with placards and shouting slogans.Meanwhile, responding to the deputy chairman, Trinamool MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said that MPs were sitting in Central Hall after being suspended. He added that they had returned to the Rajya Sabha chamber only after the adjournment of the House for the day to get their belongings.“In the commotion, the glass pane was broken. How does the responsibility of that lie on us today (in the session)? How can she (Arpita Ghosh) be suspended today [Thursday] from the session (for yesterday’s [Wednesday’s] incident which took place during adjournment)?” he questioned.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Piyush Goyal alleged that the chamber was closed for sanitisation and the MPs were trying to enter inside the chamber during that time.Leader of Opposition and Congress member Mallikarjun Kharge invoked Rule 255 of the “Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Council of States”, saying that the member is required to be absent from House only for the remaining part of the day. “They have been withdrawn only for the day’s meeting, not after adjournment... they only came here to take their things… Whatever Mr Piyush Goyal said is wrong and you (deputy chairman) are supporting the wrong narrative.”BJP MP Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi retorted saying that no one has issues with the protests in the House. “The only thing that is not acceptable is the violence… They (Opposition) want to hijack the House,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-deputy-chairman-calls-conduct-of-suspended-tmc-mp-unbecoming-101628150872410.html

05-08-2021||India||Breast milk banks: Need of the hour?||The pandemic has been hard on almost everyone, but for lactating mothers and their infants, the period has been particularly challenging. Scores of new mothers contracted Covid-19; some even succumbed to it, as a result of which pleas for breast milk for newborns came up. With this in mind, a number of lactating mothers started donating breast milk using pumps, saving lives. For the uninitiated, breast pumps are used to collect breast milk. Once collected, the milk can be immediately fed to a baby or stored in bags or containers to be used at a later stage. “Breast milk is best for the baby, so using pumps is better than giving formula feed,” opines Dr Juhi Dang, lead lactation consultant at Delhi’s Rainbow Hospital.When compared to feeding babies preterm formula, which has a risk of mortality, gut problems, surgery complications, donor’s milk has proven to be of great help. “Pumping is beneficial when there is a low breast milk supply, and it is healthy as well. It helps avoid breast engorgement, keeping it soft, and also helps breasts to be empty, thereby decreasing chances of breast pain, abscess,” says Dr Shivani Sabharwal, gynaecologist and senior consultant, Apollo Spectra, Karol Bagh. Rich in immunoglobulins, breast milk helps enhance a baby’s immunity and is easy to digest. “Women who lactate successfully have a reduced incidence of breast cancer. Lactation, by increasing metabolic rate, helps a woman in optimising weight after delivery and of course, helps a mother bond with her baby,” says Dr Ranjana Dhanu, consultant, Gynaecology and Obstetrics, at P D Hinduja Hospital & Medical Research Centre, Khar, Mumbai.The guidelines for storing breast milk for healthy, full-term babies depend on the type of breast milk, storage location and temperature. “It’s imperative to store milk at the right temperature. For NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) babies, milk can be stored in the freezer for 48 to 72 hours and should be thawed 12-24 hours before giving. The milk should be stored in the freezer between 18 and 20 degree Celcius for three to 12 months,” says Dr Archana Wadkar, lactation counselor and consultant lactation expert at Motherhood Hospital, Pune. Though Dr Aruna Kalra, Senior Gynaecologist and Obstetrician at CK Birla Hospital, Gurugram asks to exercise caution, “Breast pumps should be replaced within 3 to 6 months, depending on use. If there’s any tearing, rips, warping or discoloration, then it is time to replace your breast pump.”Currently , there are very few milk banks and owing to the pandemic , very few healthy donors too , many of whom have a surplus of milk and can easily donate milk. “This milk is pasteurised and stored in extremely hygienic conditions. I feel more women must come forward to donate milk for these babies for whom it is lifesaving nectar,” says Dr Shelly Singh, Gynaecologist, Rosewalk Hospital, Delhi. “Breast milk banks in developing countries have a pivotal role to play specially during these challenging and testing times as they help to facilitate the use of breast milk and ensure provision of mother’s milk as a gap support for new born and vulnerable babies in situations where mother’s own milk is not available,” says Rajesh Vohra CEO, Artsana India (Chicco), In assistance with Chicco Research Centre.He adds, “I would like to urge the policy makers, health care system and industry experts must come together to ensure access to milk for all babies by supporting and scaling up of milk banks in India.”Benefits of a breast pump1.

05-08-2021||India||UNSC meeting under Indian presidency on Aug 6 to discuss Afghanistan situation||The United Nations Security Council will meet under the Indian presidency on August 6 to assess the situation in Afghanistan against the backdrop of a massive campaign of violence and attacks by the Taliban to expand its influence to urban areas. TS Tirumurti, India’s ambassador to the UN announced the meeting, which will consist of a briefing and consultations on the latest developments in Afghanistan, in a tweet on Thursday. India holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council for August. The move came two days after Afghan foreign minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar called his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on Tuesday and sought an emergency session of the Security Council to discuss ways to stop the Taliban’s violence and atrocities across Afghanistan. Also Read | Jaishankar heads to UNSC, Afghanistan and maritime security on agenda“UN #SecurityCouncil will meet on Friday, 6th August, under Indian Presidency to discuss and take stock of the situation in #Afghanistan,” Tirumurti said in his tweet. The meeting was convened following consultations with the five permanent and nine other non-permanent members of the Security Council, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. Afghan ambassador Farid Mamundzay welcomed the development and thanked India for playing a “lead role as UNSC President”. “Convening an emergency UN Security Council Session on Afghanistan is a positive development. UN & international community must play a greater role to stop the unfolding tragedy in [Afghanistan] due to violence & atrocities by terrorists,” Mamundzay tweeted. Atmar’s phone call to Jaishankar on Tuesday coincided with an attack by a team of Taliban suicide attackers on the residence of defence minister Bismillah Mohammadi in Kabul. The attack triggered an intense hours-long clash between the attackers and security forces that left eight people dead and 20 more injured. There was no readout on the phone conversation from the external affairs ministry, though a statement from the Afghan foreign ministry quoted Jaishankar as saying it was important to hold a meeting of the Security Council to seek the “immediate cessation of human rights abuses and the establishment of lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan and the region”. The Afghan foreign minister had on Tuesday also briefed the envoys of several countries, including India, on the security situation and the collusion between the Taliban and groups such as Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). The Pakistani envoy was not present at this briefing. Atmar had told Jaishankar about an “unprecedented increase in the Taliban’s brutal attacks” that have resulted in the death and displacement of civilians. He described the “Taliban’s attacks in collusion with foreign fighters and terrorist groups in Afghanistan” as war crimes and a violation of international humanitarian law. At his briefing for the ambassadors, Atmar said the Taliban attacks were being carried out in “direct collusion with more than 10,000 regional terrorists” from LeT, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), al-Qaeda, Ansarullah, Jundallah, East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU). In recent days, the Taliban have expanded their campaign to capture territory from rural areas to key cities such as Herat, Kandahar and Lashkargah. Afghan security forces are being backed by local militias in fighting the Taliban in some areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unsc-meeting-under-indian-presidency-on-aug-6-to-discuss-afghanistan-situation-101628146612088.html
05-08-2021||India||Opposition slams government for absence of ministers in Parliament||The Opposition on Monday slammed the government in Rajya Sabha for the absence of their ministers from the parliamentary proceedings. They said that these ministers were disrespecting the Parliament by getting their papers laid on the table by the minister of state for parliamentary affairs instead of doing so themselves. Speaking on the behalf of the Opposition, Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member P Chidambaram said, “We can understand that the parliamentary minister can occasionally lay a paper on behalf of his colleague who is unable to attend the House for some reason, but every day we find that the parliamentary affairs minister lays papers for half a dozen ministers. Those half a dozen ministers don’t even respect the Rajya Sabha.”Also Read | Govt creating database of unorganised workers: Minister tells Rajya Sabha“How can he do it every day? Don’t these ministers want to come to Rajya Sabha?” Chidambaram questioned.Following this, the deputy chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh interrupted Chidambaram saying that this issue was mentioned in the Parliament earlier as well, but given the Covid pandemic, chairman Venkaiah Naidu had permitted the ministers to be absent.Before Chidambaram could respond, the deputy chairman went ahead with the proceedings of the House.For several days, the Opposition has been criticising the government for its ministers skipping parliamentary proceedings. Demanding a discussion on the Pegasus snooping issue, the Opposition has sought the presence of the Prime Minister and home minister in the Parliament.So far, the government has neither confirmed nor denied whether it has purchased the Pegasus spyware. NSO Group has on multiple occasions said that it offers services only to vetted government clients. The company has disputed the leaked list of numbers as those targeted by its clients.To be sure, as the methodology of the investigation explains, the presence of a number does not indicate the individual’s phone was hacked — just that it was of interest. The government denied any involvement. The opposition, however, has called for a probe into the allegations.Minister of state for parliamentary affairs V Muraleedharan, who has been laying papers on behalf of the other ministers in Rajya Sabha, laid papers for six ministers who skipped the session on Thursday as well.The BJP, meanwhile, hit out at the Congress for disrupting Parliament and not allowing discussion on serious issues.Former union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “The motto of Congress is plain and simple, so long as Parliament is allowed to subserve the dynasty, it will be allowed to function, otherwise not.”He accused the Congress of not “being serious” about discussions in Parliament.“The Congress has not been able to reconcile to the fact that the country is reposing its trust in PM Narendra Modi in elections after elections, and that the Congress is losing in elections after elections,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-slams-government-for-absence-of-ministers-in-parliament-101628146192967.html

I have set aside Rs.10 crores for this, apply below for financial support if needed," Poonawalla said in a tweet.The initiative has been launched by a television channel, of which Poonawalla is a part, and students will have to apply for the financial support.“I remain fully committed to helping Indian students quarantine in the United Kingdom on arrival for their higher studies. The new Amber List rules make it clear that Indian students will still need to quarantine, albeit at a place of their choosing. They may, therefore, still incur substantial costs,” Poonawalla said while speaking about the initiative.Meanwhile, UK moved India from its 'red' to 'amber' list which means that fully vaccinated passengers from India will no longer be subjected to compulsory 10-day hotel quarantine. The change, announced by the Department for Transport, comes into effect from 4am local time on Sunday."The UAE, Qatar, India and Bahrain will be moved from the red list to the amber list.

05-08-2021||India||Parliament: BJP hits out at Congress, says party doesn't want serious discussion||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday hit out at the Congress for disrupting Parliament and not allowing discussion on serious issues.Addressing the media, former union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “The motto of Congress is plain and simple, so long as Parliament is allowed to subserve the dynasty, it will be allowed to function, otherwise not.”Opposition parties, including the Congress, have been demanding a discussion and a reply by Prime Minister Narendra Modi or home minister Amit Shah on the Pegasus snooping controversy. Since the beginning of the Monsoon Session on July 19, both Houses of Parliament have witnessed disruption, with the Opposition members raising slogans, tearing papers and pressing for discussion on issues such as the snooping controversy, inflation and for seeking the rollback of the controversial farm laws.The government has accused the Opposition of deliberately disrupting Parliament, and thereby causing a loss to the exchequer. PM Modi has on more than one occasion asked his party members to “expose” the Opposition’s disruption of proceedings.Also Read | Govt creating database of unorganised workers: Minister tells Rajya SabhaWhile the Opposition parties have accused the government of muzzling their voices and not taking up issue they want to raise for discussion, Prasad said the government has not run away from any discussion.He accused the Congress of not “being serious” about discussions in Parliament.“The Congress has not been able to reconcile to the fact that the country is reposing its trust in PM Narendra Modi in elections after elections, and that the Congress is losing in elections after elections,” he said.Referring to the Opposition’s complaints about how Bills are being passed in both Houses without debate and discussion, the BJP leader said, “We had discussions in the Rajya Sabha to pass Bills. The Congress leaders keep asking us what have you done… during their time they denied the 2G scam and said there was zero loss…”He said the Congress party’s lack of seriousness about issues such as the Covid pandemic is evident from the fact that they skipped a meeting by the PM on the issue.“The Congress does not take Parliament seriously and we need to tell the people this. When the statement about the Pegasus snooping was made, the statement was torn from the minister‘s hand. Is there any evidence that phones of certain people were tapped? Has any responsible quarter given any prima facie evidence that phone numbers have been tapped ? Before Parliament session began, some numbers were circulated by those people who have an anti-Modi agenda,” he said.He said the government is ready to have a discussion on the issue, which he dubbed as “a campaign orchestrated by those who are hostile to the present government.”The former minister said the disruption in parliament has led to a loss of ₹130 crore to the exchequer. He also criticised the Opposition protesting on the floor of the House by tearing papers and flinging them in the air towards the Chair ,which he said is against propriety.In response to a question on the Opposition’s demand for a reply from the PM or the home minister on the Pegasus controversy, he said, “ Will they dictate everything…India is a democracy that is praised across the world. Democracy is run by probity, by propriety and certain standards of conduct.”So far, the government has neither confirmed nor denied whether it has purchased the Pegasus spyware.

05-08-2021||India||NCPCR notice to Twitter on pic shared by Rahul Gandhi with rape victim's family||The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has issued a notice to Twitter India to take action against an image shared by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi that revealed the identity of family members of rape victim violating provisions of the (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) POCSO Act and Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Act. It further asked the microblogging platform to remove the photo. The child rights body has also reportedly asked the Delhi Police to take action against Gandhi over the matter. A Delhi-based lawyer has also filed a complaint with Delhi Police against Gandhi for sharing the photo. An FIR has been registered against the Congress leader based on the complaint from Vineet Jindal.Gandhi had, on Wednesday, shared an image of himself with the parents of a Dalit minor who was allegedly raped and killed by a priest and three employees of a crematorium near Delhi Cantonment in southwest Delhi’s Old Nangal area. The faces of all three seated inside a vehicle can be seen in the photo as they engaged in a conversation. Gandhi had gone to meet the bereaved family after news of the minor’s gangrape and murder broke. Following his visit, Gandhi told the media he would stand by the family till they get justice.Along with the image, he wrote, "The parents' tears are saying only one thing - their daughter, the daughter of this country, deserves justice. And I am with them on this path of justice." Taking to Twitter, NCPCR chairperson Priyank Kanoongo wrote that revealing the identity of the girl by tweeting a photo of her parents is a violation of the POCSO Act. “Taking cognizance of this, the NCPCR has asked Twitter India to issue a notice to Rahul Gandhi and remove the post," the NCPCR tweeted.The notice, addressed to the resident grievance officer of Twitter India, the NCPCR said it had received a complaint that the photo shared by Gandhi "reveals the identities of the girl" by showing her parents.एक पीड़ित बच्ची के माता पिता की फ़ोटो ट्वीट कर उनकी पहचान उजागर कर #POCSO ऐक्ट का उल्लंघन करने पर @NCPCR_ ने संज्ञान लेते हुए @TwitterIndia को नोटिस जारी कर श्री राहुल गांधी के ट्विटर हैंडल के विरुद्ध कार्यवाही करने एवं पोस्ट हटाने के लिए नोटिस जारी किया है। pic.twitter.com/cVquij6jx3Earlier, BJP’s Sambit Patra said the party will urge the child rights body to take cognisance of the tweet as it violates Section 23 of the POCSO Act and Section 74 of Juvenile Justice Act. Accusing Gandhi of indulging into politics over the incident, Patra said the Congress practices double speak on the issue of rapes and crimes against Dalits as it maintains silence when such crimes take place in Congress-ruled states.Delhi Police has registered a case against four accused on the basis of a statement from the minor's mother who said her daughter was raped, murdered and cremated without the family’s consent on Sunday.The accused have been booked under Sections 302, 376 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code, along with the relevant sections of the POCSO Act and SC/ST Act.Meanwhile, the NCPCR has asked the district magistrate to submit an action taken report within 48 hours in Delhi's Nangal minor rape case.

The SP is taking out the demonstration across UP to register its protest against the policies of the Centre and state government.Yadav said that people of Uttar Pradesh are angry with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, and this will pave the way for their victory in the next assembly elections scheduled for 2022. The 48-year-old was dressed in his signature kurta pyjama and black waistcoat, wore a red cap of socialist party and a mask as he launched the 'cycle yatra' in Lucknow. The SP chief, surrounded by his security ring, rode out of the party's headquarters on a bicycle and was surrounded by a large number of party leaders on bicycles."We had been saying that we will win the UP assembly polls 2022 by bagging 350 seats, but the way people are angry with the government and BJP, we might win 400 seats.The state has 403 Assembly seats.The SP chief also blamed the state government for mishandling the Covid-19 pandemic."Today, we remember scores of people who lost their lives in the coronavirus outbreak under this government's mismanagement. The government and its administration failed entirely in Corona management and betrayed the people," Yadav said.Charging further at the UP government, the SP leader said that the state government has ranked at the top for mishandling all the problems faced by people."This government made UP number one in all the wrong things. It ranked at number one in black marketing of medicines, concealing failure of the government and in sacrificing teachers' lives to the virus in Panchayat polls," Yadav said."UP is number one in putting up big hoardings and advertisements to hide failures of the government," he added.The party on its Twitter handle had announced on Tuesday that Akhilesh Yadav will lead the protest in Lucknow, which is being held over issues of price rise, unemployment, farm laws, crime and jail to SP leader Azam Khan.The party is taking out a 'cycle yatra' at the tehsil-level in all districts on Thursday, the birth anniversary of SP leader Janeshwar Mishra. Yadav is later expected to pay tributes to Janeshwar Mishra at a giant statue at the Janeshwar Mishra park in Lucknow and then address the public.The yatra will cover a distance of five to 10 kilometres in all districts, the party said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-may-win-400-seats-in-up-elections-people-are-angry-with-yogi-govt-akhilesh-yadav-101628141825054.html

05-08-2021||India||All you need to know about bhumiputra Bill that Goa govt plans to reconsider||Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant on Tuesday announced that the government would bring an amended version of the controversial Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill, 2021 in the next session of the assembly around two months from now. Sawant’s decision to reconsider the Bill, that was passed without a discussion, comes amid a severe backlash across the political and social spectrum. The government has been accused of seeking to gain an undue advantage ahead of the upcoming polls, of rewarding encroachers and of prioritising the migrant workforce at the cost of locals. The Bill was tabled in the Goa assembly at around 3.30am on July 30, the previous day’s session having sat for a record 17 hours, until 4.30am. Also Read | 14 daily wagers ‘rescued’ from bonded labour in GoaDrafted with the aim of providing “a mechanism to give ownership right to dweller of a small housing unit to enable him to live with dignity and self-respect and exercise his right to life,” the Bill provided the legal basis for the Goa government to set up a “Bhumiputra Adhikarini”, an authority that would receive applications from ‘Bhumiputras,’ and after hearing objections, would be empowered to declare the applicant as the owner of the premises he was living in. Any person living in Goa for at least 30 years would be defined as a “Bhumiputra” and would be eligible to file an application for ownership under the Act. Further, a decision of the Bhumiputra Adhikarini cannot be challenged in any court of law. According to section 4 of the Bill, “the Bhumiputra Adhikarini (authority) may by an order declare a Bhumiputra to be the owner of the dwelling unit occupied by him upon payment of an amount equivalent to the value of land calculated at the market rate and such other amounts…where the land is not owned by the government the amount received shall be transferred to the owner of such land.”After consideration of objections, if any, the Bhumiputra Adhikarini shall pass an order, as deemed fit by it deciding the value of the land and the charges/fees to be paid by the applicant under various law including conversion charges, infrastructure tax, except penalty and convey his decision to the applicant, along with the challan for making payment as aforesaid.After receipt of the amount, the Bhumiputra Adhikarini shall issue an ownership sanad to the applicant in such form as prescribed and Mamlatdar having the jurisdiction shall make an entry in the (land) Record of rights, based on the Ownership Sanad granted by Bhumiputra Adhikarini under sub-section without any further notice or any proceedings.“It is clearly a licence to a person who is sitting on your land on April 1, 2019, to automatically, by this legislation, acquire ownership rights and title to your property. Irrespective of whether he’s an encroacher or even if he’s your tenant,” Adv Carlos Alvares Ferreira a former Advocate General of Goa. “They have said 30 years’ residence (to be eligible), but it doesn’t say that it should be 30 years in that house. It only requires residence anywhere in Goa for the last 30 years and then you should have been in that house on April 1, 2019,” he added. That the bill was hurriedly and poorly drafted emerged after the government, through a BJP legislator, moved an amendment to ensure that people staying via rent agreements or tenancy agreements do not claim ownership of the house or room they are living in. Chief minister Sawant on Tuesday night, however, confirmed that via the amendment, “people can only apply for the ownership of their own dwelling units -- that is the electricity and water bill needs to be in their name”.“We brought this amendment in the house before passing the Bill. This is only for dwelling units and not for commercial purpose,” he said. In the original copy of the Bill circulated in the House and on the Vidhan Sabha website, the amendment is not yet reflected. “This bill has been brought specifically for those who have built houses on government land and on comunidade (community) land. This category of people couldn’t take advantage of the Mundkar Act and the Regularization of Houses Act. This Act is especially for them,” Sawant said. “There are many who are saying that this bill has been brought for the benefit of migrants (who may be staying in illegal slums). I wish to ask them, ‘when did these migrants come? When did they build their houses? When did they encroach upon government land and common land? And if they are squatting on government land have they paid for it? Or have those lands been allowed to be taken over for free?” the CM asked.The fate of the Bill -- that was already passed by the assembly -- remains unclear with Sawant not specifically saying it will be withdrawn. However, with the government promising to bring a revised Bill, it is unlikely that the governor or President of India (since it is a Bill concerning land rights) will grant assent making it a law.Congress spokesperson Sunil Kawthankar said the proposed law is against law abiding citizens and favours encroachers. “Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Act is a tight slap on every hardworking Goan’s face by the BJP government for votes in the coming elections. The law is also not legally tenable as an authority cannot provide legal rights to an encroacher or squatter,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-bhumiputra-bill-that-goa-govt-plans-to-reconsider-101628142891839.html
05-08-2021||India||India prepared for long haul with China over Ladakh||The Narendra Modi government is prepared for the long haul with China on resolving the East Ladakh situation post PLA May 2020 aggression even though the 12th senior commander meeting on July 31 at Chushul recorded an incremental movement at Gogra-Hot Springs friction point.Given that it took nearly eight years to resolve the 1986 Sumdorong Chu military stand-off in Arunachal Pradesh, the Modi government is prepared for further rounds of military negotiations without any unilateral dilution of the Indian position on the present stand-off in East Ladakh while maintaining a hawk eye over the eastern sector. “It is an endless night,” said a senior official.The Indian position put across by forcefully by Ladakh Corps Commander Lt Gen P G K Menon is that all contentious frictions points between the two armies must be resolved. This includes Depsang Bulge and Gogra-Hot Springs, where the PLA continues to be in an aggressive mode. The Modi government is very clear that the way to restoration of bilateral ties with China goes through the resolution of the Ladakh LAC as a first step. Any proposal suggesting 1980s parallel diplomacy—restoring economic ties while the military stand-off is on in East Ladakh-- is out of question for the Modi government. This is because the PLA is fully deployed across the LAC in East Ladakh with the PLAAF strengthening its air bases in the Western Theatre Command with advanced fighters and missile systems.While India is negotiating with China on peaceful resolution of the western sector, the Indian intelligence has alerted the military of increased PLA activity in the Eastern sector. The July 23 visit of Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping to Nyingchi across Arunachal Pradesh has caused concern as he was briefed about the military situation on the LAC in eastern sector.Since May 2020 PLA aggression on Galwan, Gogra-Hot Springs and Pangong Tso, the PLA has also tremendously improved military infrastructure across the Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh sector with new fortified bunkers and missile systems. The PLA has deployed Russian S-400 missile system at Nyingchi with the second one possibly deployed at Hotan in Xinjiang region. For the past one year, increased communication activity has been noticed all along the 3,488 km LAC with Chumbi Valley activity across Nathu La in Sikkim a matter of serious security concern.Apart from fortifying military infrastructure in Tibet and Xinjiang, the Chinese information warfare has reached a very high level of sophistication with the adversary being targeted from both within and outside the country. The Chinese population, however, has been fire-walled to ensure that the real situation is always kept out of bounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-prepared-for-a-long-haul-with-china-over-ladakh-101628141502624.html

As part of a review of its “red-amber-green traffic light ratings” for international travellers, the UK on Wednesday moved India, along with Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), from the “red” to the “amber” list. A statement from the British High commission said that, under the changes coming into effect at 4 am on August 8, “visit visas for the UK from India are open (in addition to other visa long-term visas that have remained open)”. Travellers arriving in the UK from India can complete a 10-day quarantine at home or in the place they are staying, and it will no longer be mandatory for them to quarantine in a managed hotel.

Under the UK’s voluntary “Test to Release” scheme, Indian travellers can choose to pay for a private Covid-19 test on the fifth day of quarantine. If the result is negative, they can end their quarantine, the statement said. The UK government announced India, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE had been moved from the red to the amber list as the “situation in these countries has improved”.“The data for all countries will be kept under review and the government will not hesitate to take action where a country’s epidemiological picture changes,” the British government said. UK transport secretary Grant Shapps said: “We are committed to opening up international travel safely, taking advantage of the gains we’ve made through our successful vaccination programme, helping connect families, friends and businesses around the world.”UK health secretary Sajid Javid added: “As we learn to live with this virus, we are continuing to take steps to safely reopen international travel based on the latest data and expert public health advice.”The UK’s classification changes were decided by ministers based on the latest data and analysis by the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) and public health considerations.India’s foreign secretary Harsh Shringla had urged the UK to ease travel restrictions for Indians during a recent visit to London, arguing that infections had significantly declined in key cities such as New Delhi and Mumbai. Since February, travellers from a red list country have been required to book a stay in a managed quarantine facility for 10 days. In order to ensure British taxpayers are not subsidising the costs of staying in these facilities, the cost will increase from August 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-eases-travel-restrictions-on-india-10-day-hotel-quarantine-no-longer-mandatory-101628139171474.html

05-08-2021||India||With new chief in Assam, Congress looks to revive lost glory||Congress in Assam hopes for a change in fortunes with appointment of the party’s new state unit chief Bhupen Borah who assumed charge on Wednesday in Guwahati. Borah and three working presidents, Rana Goswami, Kamalakhya Deb Purkayastha and Zakir Hussain Sikdar, assume office after the party’s second successive loss to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the assembly polls and at a time when its legislators are quitting and joining the ruling dispensation. “I thank all for their blessings on my new role. I assure to take the party forward with advice of all seniors and the hard work of our young workers,” Borah said after taking charge from outgoing chief Ripun Borah. Congress, which ruled Assam for three successive terms from 2001, secured 26 of the total 126 seats in 2016 and lost to the BJP that formed its first ever government in the state. In this year’s polls, the party bagged 29 seats, but failed to stop BJP from coming to power for a second time. Prior to the polls, Congress had formed a 10 party ‘grand alliance’ that included All India United Democratic Front and Bodoland People’s Party. But together they bagged 50 seats, while BJP (60) and its allies Asom Gana Parishad (9) and United Peoples Party Liberal (6) secured 75 seats. Also Read | Will withdraw cases against Gorkhas in foreigners’ tribunals: Assam CM Sarma“There is no need to feel disappointed. Our vote difference with BJP in 2021 was marginal, but we failed to form government. The BJP alliance got around 9.1 million votes while Congress and its allies cornered around 8.9 million votes,” outgoing president Ripun Borah said. Leader of Congress legislature party Debabrata Saikia said that the party needs to have close door meetings where all issues are laid out and discussed threadbare. He said that specifics of votes secured in each constituency should also be looked at closely if Congress has to win at least 64 seats in 2026. Accusing the BJP-led government in Assam of playing divisive politics on the basis of religion, Lok Sabha MP Pradyut Bordoloi urged the new state president to present a counter narrative that unites all people of Assam. “Congress revival should start from villages. Leaders must visit districts, spend time with local workers and get to know their problems. Besides banking on our traditional vote banks, we need to expand among new voters as well,” said Lok Sabha MP Gaurav Gogoi. Since this year’s assembly election loss, two Congress MLAs have quit the party and joined the BJP. There are speculations that some others could also leave the party in the near future. “We face a lot of challenges now. Let those who want to go, leave the party. It will help cleanse the Congress,” said Ripun Borah. Besides preventing more legislators and leaders leaving the party and heading to the BJP camp, newly appointed chief Bhupen Borah also has the task of winning the by-polls in five seats which are vacant due to deaths of two MLAs, two Congress legislators resigning and elevation of former chief minister and Majuli MLA Sarbananda Sonowal as a Cabinet minister at Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-new-chief-in-assam-congress-looks-to-revive-lost-glory-101628137131488.html

This is an increase of nearly 300 cases recorded on Wednesday.For the second day in a row, India recorded more than 40,000 cases of coronavirus disease amid concerns of a rise in the trajectory of fresh infections.The active cases in the country have surged by more than 700 cases in the last 24 hours, taking the caseload to 4,11,076. This accounts for 1.29% of the total cases seen in the country so far.With 41,726 patients recovering during the last 24 hours, the national recovery rate in the country has been logged at 97.3 per cent. The total recoveries from the viral contagion in the country stand at 30,974,748.India has administered 48.93 crore Covid-19 doses so far, data released by the health ministry showed.According to a study, India is likely to witness another surge in Covid-19 cases in August but not as grave as the second wave. Researchers Mathukumalli Vidyasagar and Manindra Agrawal at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Hyderabad and Kanpur respectively have predicted that a surge in Covid-19 cases will push the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. The wave is likely to peak in October.The rise in Covid-19 cases will begin as soon as August, marking the rise of the third wave, according to experts. They have predicted that the virulence of this wave is expected to push the cases to less than 100,000 infections a day in the best-case scenario or nearly 150,000 in the worst scenario.India's current surge in cases is being driven by states like Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Lakshwadweep, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Karnataka, Puducherry and Kerala, which have reported a trend of rising cases and are now under scrutiny of the central government.Health ministry officials have maintained that the spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant of Covid-19 is a dominant problem."The pandemic is still raging and we are concerned that some states have the R number which is rising, which shows the virus wishes to expand and we must curb it," Niti Aayog Member (Health) Dr VK Paul said earlier this week, addressing a press briefingThe government has stressed on hotspot states to rely on contact tracing and create containment zones wherever clusters are identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-covid-19-cases-continue-to-rise-after-42-982-infections-recorded-in-24-hours-101628128930337.html

The move signals India's intent to play a bigger role in regional efforts to counter China.Four ships, including a guided missile destroyer and a missile frigate, will be deployed for a two-month period to southeast Asia, the South China Sea and the western Pacific, the navy said in the statement."The deployment of the Indian Navy ships seeks to underscore the operational reach, peaceful presence and solidarity with friendly countries towards ensuring good order in the maritime domain..." the navy said.The Indian ships will take part in annual joint war drills involving the United States, Japan and Australia - the group known as Quad along with India - off the coast of Guam, the navy said. The Quad has emerged as a platform to counter an assertive China.The mood of Indian navy has hardended following the clashes between Indian and Chinese militaries in Galwan in East Ladakh last year.South China Sea has emerged as one of the flashpoints between China and other countries, including smaller ones like the Philippines, Vietnam etc who accuse the dragon of exercising undue pressure in the region by claiming it as its own territory.The United States and Britain too have deployed their respective naval vessels in the region. The Elizabeth carrier strike group is heading to Japan to exercise with its maritime forces. Japan has shown urgency to ramp up its military capabilities and deepen military cooperation with Quad and other allies at a time when China has emerged as country's top security threat.China had recently threatened to nuke Japan if it interferes in Taiwan or East China Sea by saying that Beijing will revisit its no first use option.Meanwhile, Washington too has rejected what it calls unlawful territorial claims by Beijing in the resource-rich waters.In June, a US aircraft carrier group led by the USS Ronald Reagan entered the South China Sea as part of a routine mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stern-message-to-china-indian-warships-head-to-south-china-sea-101628135035222.html

05-08-2021||India||India enforcement agency threatens Flipkart, founders with $1.35 billion fine||India's financial-crime agency has asked Walmart's Flipkart and its founders to explain why they shouldn't face a penalty of $1.35 billion for alleged violation of foreign investment laws, three sources and an agency official told Reuters.The Enforcement Directorate agency has been investigating e-commerce giants Flipkart and Amazon.com Inc for years for allegedly bypassing foreign investment laws that strictly regulate multi-brand retail and restrict such companies to operating a marketplace for sellers.The Enforcement Directorate official, who declined to be named, said the case concerned an investigation into allegations that Flipkart attracted foreign investment and a related party, WS Retail, then sold goods to consumers on its shopping website, which was prohibited under law.A so-called "show cause notice" was issued in early July by the agency's office in southern city of Chennai to Flipkart, its founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal as well as current investor Tiger Global, to explain why they should not face a fine of 100 billion rupees ($1.35 billion) for the lapses, said the agency official and the sources, who are all familiar with the content of the notice.A Flipkart spokesperson said the company is "in compliance with Indian laws and regulations"."We will cooperate with the authorities as they look at this issue pertaining to the period 2009-2015 as per their notice," the spokesperson added.The Indian agency does not make public such notices issued to parties during an investigation.One of the sources said Flipkart and others have around 90 days to respond to the notice. WS Retail ceased operations at the end of 2015, the person added.Tiger Global declined to comment. Binny Bansal and Sachin Bansal did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Enforcement Directorate also did not respond outside regular business hours.Walmart took a majority stake in Flipkart for $16 billion in 2018, its biggest deal ever. Sachin Bansal sold his stake to Walmart at the time, while Binny Bansal retained a small stake. Walmart did not respond to a request for comment.Flipkart's valuation doubled to $37.6 billion in less than 3 years at a $3.6 billion funding round in July, during which SoftBank Group reinvested in the company ahead of an expected market debut.The notice is the latest regulatory headache for the online retailer, which is already facing tougher restrictions and antitrust investigations in India, and a growing number of complaints from smaller sellers.India's brick-and-mortar retailers say Amazon and Flipkart favour select sellers on their platforms and use complex business structures to bypass the foreign investment laws, hurting smaller players. The companies deny any wrongdoing.In February, a Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/amazon-india-operation based on Amazon documents showed it had given preferential treatment for years to a small group of sellers, publicly misrepresented ties with them and used them to bypass Indian law. Amazon says it gives no preferential treatment to any seller.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-enforcement-agency-threatens-flipkart-founders-with-1-35-billion-fine-101628132411692.html

05-08-2021||India||2 years of abrogation of Article 370: 5 big changes in Jammu and Kashmir||August 5 is the day when Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into two Union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh in 2019. Today, it is the second anniversary of the historic decision, which left a deep impact on the region.On August 5, 2019, Articles 370 and 35(A) were nullified that gave the erstwhile state its special status and the mandate to define its domicile rules.While political parties in Jammu and Kashmir have vowed to continue their struggle for restoration of statehood, here is a look at big changes which have taken place in these two years:People from outside J&K can buy land there: In October last year, the Centre paved the way for people from outside Jammu and Kashmir to buy land in the union territory. In a gazette notification, the central government omitted the phrase “permanent resident of the state” from Section 17 of the Jammu and Kashmir Development Act that deals with disposal of the land in the union territory. However, the amendment did not allow transfer of agricultural land to non-agriculturists except in few cases.Non-local spouses of J&K women get domicile status: The rules were changed in July this year to allow domicile certificate to be granted to the husbands of local women married to people from outside Jammu and Kashmir. The move will allow them to buy land or property in the Union territory, or apply for government jobs. All people who have resided in the UT for 15 years, or have studied for seven years and appeared in Class 10 or 12 examination in an educational institution in the region, and their children, are eligible for grant of domicile status.Separate flag of Jammu and Kashmir became defunct: After the abrogation of Article 370, the civil secretariat in Srinagar hoisted the Indian Tricolour, while the state's own flag was missing. The rectangular flag - red background with three white vertical stripes alongside a white plough in the middle with handle facing the stripes - fluttered next to the Indian national flag on the secretariat for more than six decades.No security clearance for passport to stone pelters: The CID wing of Jammu and Kashmir Police has ordered the denial of security clearance required for passport and other government services to all those involved in stone-pelting or subversive activities. The order was issued on July 31 and directed all the field to ensure that the person's involvement in law and order, stone-pelting cases, and other crime prejudicial to the security of the state be specifically looked into during verification related to passport service and other government schemes.The formation of Gupkar alliance: In the early hours of August 5, hundreds of political leaders and workers - including three former chief ministers Mufti, Omar Abdullah and his father Farooq Abdullah - were detained. The Abdullahs were released in March 2020, and Mufti was freed in the second week of October last year. Since then, the leaders have come together - along with four other parties in Kashmir - to forge an informal alliance that aims to work for the restoration of the region's special status.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-years-of-abrogation-of-article-370-5-big-changes-in-jammu-and-kashmir-101628130402726.html

05-08-2021||India||Number Theory: How vulnerable is India to a third Covid wave?||The seven-day average of daily new Covid-19 cases in India has been rising in the past two weeks – from 37,975 in the week ending July 22 to 40,710 for the week ending August 3.That isn’t a significant increase in absolute terms but it has still given rise to questions on whether India is witnessing the beginning of a third wave of Covid-19 infections, and, if so, whether this wave will be as severe as the second?Three factors will determine the answers: pace of vaccinations, regional and demographic variations in vaccination, and presence of antibodies in the population.1. The country’s vaccination progress so farAccording to data from the Co-WIN dashboard, around 40% of India’s adult population – 375 million out of a projected population of 940 million – has received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine as on August 3. The share of population which has received both doses is much lower, 11%. This number is expected to increase faster as more people become eligible for their second dose of vaccination, as reported in a July 17 story by Jamie Mullick.Is India’s current vaccination progress enough to slow down a Covid-19 wave? Perhaps not. After all, more than half of the population in the US and UK has been fully vaccinated and cases have started rising at a rapid pace in both countries, largely due to the Delta variant of the coronavirus. Where vaccines have helped is in bringing down deaths, as is clear from a comparison of deaths in the adequately vaccinated West and poorly vaccinated Asian and African nations.2. The threat of community transmission remainsResearch shows that even one dose of Covid-19 vaccine offers some protection against even the Delta variant. So, the fact that at least 40% of India’s population has received at least one dose is good news. The headline number should be read with a caveat, though. India opened its vaccination drive for different age-cohorts at different times. It was opened on March 1 for those above 60 years, April 1 for those between 45-60 years and only on May 1 for the 18-44 years age group.These factors, and the extended gap between doses for the vaccine most used in India (Covishield; at least 12 weeks) have resulted in the older cohort having an edge in the share of the vaccinated population. The share of population which has received at least one dose of the vaccine was 27.6% in the 18-44-year-old age group, compared to 55.9% for those over the age of 60.The younger population is more likely to venture out and be potential carriers of the virus. The Time Use Survey conducted by the National Statistical Office (NSO) in 2019 lists eight different activities that are directly related to travelling – from commuting for work or studies to travelling for leisure or self-care activities. Most people between the ages of six and 54 travelled on average for around 40 minutes in a day in 2019. This dropped to 32.6 minutes for 55-64 year olds and just 19.9 minutes for those in the 65 and above cohort.This means that India’s vaccine protection against community transmission could be lower than what the headline vaccination numbers suggest.3. Huge disparity in vaccination coverage across statesThe other factor worth taking note of is the difference across states in the share of population which has received at least one dose of vaccine. There is a wide variation on this count: Himachal Pradesh has vaccinated more than 73% of its population, while Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have managed to vaccinate less than 30%. This also means that the states at the bottom of the vaccination ladder will be more vulnerable to a third wave. It is on this count that there is some relief for Kerala, which is contributing around half of the total daily new cases but has vaccinated more than 55% of its eligible population.There are no population projections for districts. However, even coverage with respect to the total population of a district in the 2011 Census shows the difference in coverage among districts. The top 128 of 640 districts have administered at least one dose of the vaccines to 43% of their total population. States with most number of districts of this kind are the ones that are doing well overall. The highest number of such districts (12) are from Himachal Pradesh, followed by 11 from Arunachal and Jammu and Kashmir, and 10 from Uttarakhand. No district in Bihar, Jharkhand, or Andhra Pradesh has this level of coverage. The least vaccinated 128 districts have at least partly vaccinated 12.2%-21.6% of their population. 43 of these districts are from Uttar Pradesh, 29 from Bihar, and 12 from West Bengal – the states that lag the most in overall vaccinations. The five districts with the least coverage are Senapati in Manipur (12.2%), Mewat in Haryana (12.6%), Rae Bareli (12.7%) and Badaun (12.8%) in Uttar Pradesh, and Mahbubnagar (13%) in Telangana. The entire population in New Delhi, the Central district of Delhi, Daman and 95% of the population in Gurugram and Dadra and Nagar Haveli have received at least one dose of the vaccine.4. What about likely antibody immunity from 2nd wave?Antibodies in infected patients are believed to grant temporary immunity against infections. It is on this count that India may have an advantage even as it scrambles to reach a critical mass of vaccinated population. The latest sero-prevalence survey, which was conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in June-July showed a big spike in the prevalence of antibodies: from 24% in December-January to 67.6% in June-July. The second wave of Covid-19 infections, as per the seven-day average of daily new cases, peaked on May 9. The fact that Kerala has the lowest prevalence of antibodies in the latest sero-survey and is also witnessing the most new infections in the country right now suggests that states with higher antibody levels could enjoy some protection against a new wave of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/number-theory-how-vulnerable-is-india-to-a-third-covid-wave-101628114681809.html
05-08-2021||India||Bill seeking to develop smaller airports passed||The Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Bill 2021, which aims to promote the development of smaller airports, and seeks to group airports together to improve their attractiveness to investors, was approved by the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday amid protests by opposition parties over the Pegasus snooping issue.This will now pave the way for the bill to become a law. It was cleared by the Lok Sabha on July 29 and will now need President Ram Nath Kovind’s assent.The Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Bill 2021, which proposed to amend the definition of ”major airport” under the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority Act, 2008 (AERA Act), was tabled by the civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on the floor of the House.“We have identified five zones for this clubbing, which include north, south, east, west, and northeast zone. Based on this clubbing... Airport Authority of India will be giving a priority to airports in smaller cities and newer airports will also be inaugurated…,” Scindia informed the House on July 29.Hailing the efforts of the Narendra Modi-led government for making air travel accessible for everyone, the minister added: “Prime Minister Modi is someone who truly democratised travel. In the midst of the spread of coronavirus and when there is sloganeering, our government is committed to the development of the poor and the farmers.”He also listed various areas that have benefited from the central government’s Udaan, or the regional connectivity scheme. Over the last one-and-a-half years, several smaller cities such as Darbhanga in Bihar, Belgaum and Hubli in Karnataka, Jharsuguda in Odisha and Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh, which were earlier “missing” from the map of civil aviation, have witnessed 110 flight movements from various parts of the country, he said.The bill was subsequently referred to a parliamentary standing committee on transport, tourism and culture, which has since then approved it without any changes.“The Bill intends to aid the government’s plan for privatization of smaller airports as part of its asset monetization programme announced during the budget for 2021-22. The Bill also promises to help faster develop the smaller airports and expedite the regional air connectivity scheme, UDAN, by expanding the air connectivity to relatively remote areas,” said Poonam Verma, partner, J. Sagar Associates.“The amendment will allow AERA to regulate tariff and other charges for aeronautical services for not just major airports with annual passenger traffic of more than 3.5 million, but also a group of airports together,” Verma added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bill-seeking-to-develop-smaller-airports-passed-101628106382306.html
05-08-2021||India||After 2 yrs, BJP removes 3 DY CM posts||Bengaluru: After two years, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to do away with the three deputy chief minister formula in Karnataka that was aimed to showcase representation of different castes in higher echelons of the government. The system was introduced in the BS Yediyurappa government, where three deputy chief ministers from prominent communities in the state were appointed, and designation was perceived to check-mate Yediyurappa’s clout. While administratively these posts didn’t hold any additional power other than the portfolios allocated to them, the system was aimed at creating new leaders in these communities. In the previous government, the three deputy chief ministers belonged to Lingayat, Vokkaliga, and Dalit communities. These communities [Lingayats (16%), Vokkaligas (14%), SC/ST (9%] constitute approximately 39% of the population. The choices indicated the caste combinations that the BJP is trying to project. Govid Karjol hails from a Scheduled Caste community, while Ashwath Narayan is a Vokkaliga and Laxman Savadi a Lingayat. It remains unclear if they will retain their old portfolios in the new cabinet. While BJP has the support of the Lingayat community, it is yet to gain the trust of the Vokkaliga and Dalit voters in the state. Appointing deputy chief ministers was part of the BJP’s plans to create a second layer of leadership, who can become the face of these communities within the BJP. On Wednesday, while talking to reporters before the swearing-in of the new cabinet members, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said that the party’s central leadership has decided not to continue with the posts of deputy chief ministers. “In our previous government, led by BS Yediyurappa, there were three deputy chief ministers. The high command has now told us that there will not be any deputy chief ministers in this government,” he said. Reacting to this development, former deputy chief minister Ashwath Narayana said, “I’m totally unaware (of how the high command came up with the decision). Whatever decision was taken by the party and the honorable chief minister, it is their decision whether to have it or not. So whatever they decide, it is acceptable to all of us.” The chief minister did not provide a reason for the removal, however, BJP leaders with whom HT spoke with pointed out three possible reasons for the change. First, the three DCM experiment has failed to produce leaders from the community; second, there was intense lobbying for the position ahead of the cabinet expansion; and third, they didn’t want any more alternative powerhouses to emerge in the party. According to a senior BJP office bearer, the three communities which were given the posts of deputy chief ministers did not rally behind their candidates and was one of the reasons for the removal of these posts. “The central command feels that the three deputy chief minister’s, despite being in power for two years, didn’t find support within their respective communities. If you look at it, there was no demand from these communities to elevate any of the DCMs to the post of chief minister. It was a clear sign,” said the officer. Another BJP MLA said that the purpose of appointing three deputy chief ministers was an attempt to dilute Yediyurappa’s power and since he is now out of power, there is no requirement for these posts. “Two years ago, Yediyurappa was a powerhouse. So, creating these second layers of leadership was an attempt to create alternate powerhouses,” the leader said. He added that since Yediyurappa no longer holds power, the party doesn’t want any more new regional political powerhouses to emerge. “They want a government that runs on the instructions of the central high command. Now they have it, they want to ensure it stays that way,” said an MLA, who is associated with the Yediyurappa camp. Despite these reasons listed out by party leaders, one of the main reasons for removing these posts was intense lobbying. “From the day the new chief minister was announced, there was intense lobbying from both camps within the BJP. Since both parties could not reach any consensus, the party decided to drop the post altogether,” said a party official. Political experts said that all these factors could have resulted in the decision to remove the DCM posts. “I won’t look at these factors in isolation. The important point here is that the new chief minister is a candidate handpicked by the central high command and also approved by the former chief minister. So, the leadership wants to discontinue the old ways and empower the current CM,” said political analyst Sandeep Shastry. According to him, it is important for the BJP to ensure no alternate powerhouse is created in the state. “They don’t want to checkmate the new CM as they did with Yediyurappa. Another reason is that they don’t want any influence from the former chief minister by having someone close to Bommai, like in the position of the deputy chief minister,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-2-yrs-bjp-removes-3-dy-cm-posts-101628106231970.html
05-08-2021||India||Karnataka ministers allotted districts to check Covid, floods||Bengaluru: Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday said that all newly inducted ministers will be assigned districts to take care of in the wake of the floods and the threat of the imminent third wave of Covid-19 infections in the state. “All ministers will visit districts assigned to them and review the flood and Covid-19 situation in the district and the relief works taken up and report the requirement of additional assistance for relief,” a statement by the chief minister’s office (CMO) stated. Karnataka is witnessing heavy rainfall in several districts which has inundated several villages in at least 13 districts and has so far lost just as many human lives. Interestingly, the 29 ministers who were inducted on Wednesday are yet to be allotted portfolios, but instead they have been assigned districts to manage floods and Covid-19 preparations. The Bommai government, in its first cabinet meeting held after the swearing-in ceremony on Wednesday afternoon, also decided to reconstitute the Covid-19 taskforce that was last led by then deputy chief minister Dr CN Ashwath Narayan. Karnataka has seen a spike in covid-19 cases and authorities are hoping not to make the same mistakes that it did during the first and second waves which cost lives and livelihoods. Gaurav Gupta, the chief commissioner of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on Wednesday said that Bengaluru has a less than 1% Covid positivity rate with around 400 cases every day. “However, there is a risk of cases increasing as the virus is spreading in the neighbouring states. In this regard, Covid guidelines must be followed without fail in all apartments,” he said in his conversations with resident welfare associations. Gupta also held meetings with trade associations across Bengaluru. He said that the government had unlocked the city to facilitate all business activities to take place but failure of following Covid appropriate behaviour were not being followed, leading to the possibility of another spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-ministers-allotted-districts-to-check-covid-floods-101628106168289.html

Patil Munenakoppa while taking the Oath of Office and secrecy as minister has taken the oath of office twice and has not read the oath of secrecy,” according to a statement by the special secretary to the governor.“Hence, Shri Shankar B. Patil Munenakoppa was recalled to Raj Bhavan and the Honble Governor of Karnataka administered the oath of office and secrecy once again in the evening,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newly-inducted-minister-made-to-take-oath-again-101628106107121.html
05-08-2021||India||Bommai is chief minister of Yediyurappa’s cabinet||Bengaluru When BS Yediyurappa’s vehicle first drove into the Raj Bhavan Glass house (where the swearing in ceremony was held), the joke going around was that the chief minister had arrived. And when Basavaraj Bommai’s vehicle came in a few minutes later, the reference was that the deputy chief minister has arrived. Despite Karnataka getting a new chief minister, all indications point towards the possibility that Yediyurappa is still the chief minister and Bommai his deputy as the newly formed cabinet has the former’s name written all over it. Yediyurappa, the 78-year-old who was forced to step down on July 26, had gone to extreme lengths not just to nominate his confidant Bommai as his replacement but also get all those he wanted into the newly inducted cabinet, including the turncoats who helped him to power in 2019. Barring Srimant Patil and R Shankar, Bommai’s cabinet has most of the people who helped Yediyurappa come to power in 2019. Yediyurappa has also bulldozed any possible consideration of his staunch critics--CP Yogeshwara, Basangagouda Patil (Yatnal) and Arvind Bellad--into the cabinet, demonstrating his ability to keep his critics under check. On a specific question on the confusion that prevailed till the last minute of the cabinet formation, Bommai said, “There is no confusion, BJP is a national party. There is a confident government of the Prime Minister, guidance of Amit Shah, political astuteness of Nadda ji and the blessings of Yediyurappa. So there is no confusion.” Bommai has met Yediyurappa on almost a daily basis since taking over, indicating that most of the directions were coming from the former CM, who, despite appearances and statements not to interfere, remains the one in command, people aware of the developments said. “Our seniors have taken into account several issues and after our discussions with them, this decision has been taken. There is no question of anyone’s pressure,” Bommai reiterated. Taking a dig at Bommai’s new cabinet, Priyank Kharge, Congress legislator and former minister tweeted on Wednesday, “Once again @BSYBJP shows PM @narendramodi & HM @AmitShah who is the boss. @BJP4Karnataka was expecting major churn & bring in a “Hosa BJP” for a “Hosa Karnataka”, this cabinet is just BSY ver2.0 with more bugs & glitches.” The Opposition had already termed Bommai as a ‘rubber stamp CM’. Political analysts said that Yediyurappa never ceded control despite the show of stepping down and playing “loyal party worker”. Yediyurappa and his family were criticised for misusing their powers to keep dissidents in check and were accused of widespread corruption, which had played a part in the high command seeking the former’s exit. But with Bommai as just an interim choice, Yediyurappa, people aware of the developments said, is forcing the BJP to continue to depend on the former chief minister to keep the support base of the Lingayats as well as help lead the party in the 2023 assembly elections. One analyst, requesting anonymity, said that Yediyurappa had pitted the Mathas or monasteries against the BJP’s high command, making it harder for the local legislators to oppose these powerful institutions and their seers. “Power has been decentralised in Karnataka,” said the political analyst, referring to the conditions where legislators are not likely to follow every order of the BJP’s central leadership but rather focus on holding on to power in their respective constituencies. Yediyurappa has also forced a cold shoulder towards the core-BJP or persons who identify with the core ideology of the party, leaving them to fend for themselves once again. The one thing that Yediyurappa could not manage yet is placating his son, BY Vijayendra, in the government. But with at least one seat vacant in Hangal, this may well be his next play to continue his legacy, which he was unwilling to surrender to the BJP’s national leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bommai-is-chief-minister-of-yediyurappa-s-cabinet-101628105989281.html

Restrictions are already in place since August 2, 6 am. The order bars the assembly of more than four people and restricts activities, except those permitted by the government . Night curfew between 10 pm to 5 am has also been extended until August 16, the order stated. As the cases in the neighbouring districts of Maharashtra and Kerala are on the rise, the restrictions at Karnataka-Kerala border check posts will be in force till the Covid positivity rate comes down, said Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Pratap Reddy on Tuesday. “Passengers at railway stations without RT-PCR negative reports had been shifted to a temporary quarantine centre at Townhall. After the swab tests, those testing positive will be shifted to Covid Care Centres (CCC) and those testing negative can return home. We have requested the authorities to bring down the time taken for giving test reports,” Reddy added.The state reported 1,769 new cases on Wednesday, taking the active caseload to 24,305. Bengaluru accounted for 411 new infections, taking its active cases to 8,705. As many as 30 fatalities were reported across the state on Monday, which took the state’s toll to 36,680. Bengaluru’s toll due to Covid-19 jumped to 15,896, with 4 deaths being reported on Wednesday, according to the state health department. According to experts, it is time for the government to increase vaccination in the state. On the minimum vaccination target needed to avoid a severe third wave, experts said that anywhere between 60% and 75% of the population should get at least the first dose of the vaccine before the third wave hits. To break down the numbers, the population of Karnataka, according to the government projections, is approximately 65 million. According to the Karnataka election commission, around 51 million people in the state are eligible voters, which is roughly the estimated number of those eligible for the vaccination. So far, only 24 million people have received at least one shot so far, which is less than 50% of the target audience. “Vaccinating people at the earliest is critical now. The majority of the population falls in the 18-45 age category. With multiple variants that are being reported, this age group is one of the most vulnerable sections,” said Dr Vishal Rao, a member of the expert committee on Karnataka’s Covid task force. “There is no doubt that if we don’t vaccinate enough population, the third wave will be as bad, or even worse, than the second,” said CN Manjunath, Karnataka Covid-19 Task Force member and director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research. “Only if are able to build enough herd immunity can we blunt the impact of the third wave. But it is going to be a challenge,” he said.The second wave has shown an increase in the number of deaths in the 30-45 age group. A comparison of the numbers of the first and second wave shows that in the first wave, around 11 out of 100 deaths were reported in the 30-45 age group, while in the second wave, 16 out of 100 deaths were reported in this category. For those under 30 years, in the first wave, 2.2% of deaths belonged to those who fell in this age category, while in the second wave, it increased to 2.9%, according to state data. Meanwhile, Karnataka’s own vaccine registration app, titled Co-Win Kar, is available for download on Google Play Store. According to the health department, the current version is a pilot project and so far there have been around 100 downloads. “The big change in the new app is that beneficiaries who select vaccination centres of choice must produce address proof within the vicinity of the centre, which ensures that vaccine slots in the outskirts of the city are not taken by those from the city,” said a senior health department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bluru-extends-night-curfew-invokes-sec-144-to-curb-covid-spread-101628105987846.html
05-08-2021||India||No manual scavenging deaths, 941 died while cleaning sewers: Govt||New Delhi: No one succumbed to manual scavenging in India but 941 workers died while cleaning sewers and septic tanks in the last three decades, the government told Parliament on Wednesday, triggering condemnation from activists. Union social justice minister Virendra Kumar also told the Rajya Sabha that 58,098 manual scavengers were identified across the country in two separate surveys in 2013 and 2018. “There is no report of death due to manual scavenging. However, we have reports regarding deaths of workers while being engaged in cleaning of sewers or septic tanks,” he said, listing out 941 deaths since 1993, when manual scavenging was first banned. Tamil Nadu reported the highest number of such deaths at 213, followed by 153 in Gujarat, 104 in Uttar Pradesh, 98 in Delhi, 84 in Karnataka and 73 in Haryana, the data showed.In response to another question, Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Ramdas Athawale said 941 deaths have been recorded since 1993. Last week, Athawale told the Upper House that no deaths of manual scavengers were reported across the country in the last five years. Manual scavenging is banned under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013. The caste-based practice was first banned in 1993 but activists allege that it continues clandestinely and overtly. Under the Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS), Kumar said one-time cash assistance of ₹40,000 was deposited directly into the bank accounts of all the identified and eligible 58,098 manual scavengers. The highest number of manual scavengers was reported from Uttar Pradesh. The government distinguishes between manual scavenging – a caste-based practice of people cleaning human excreta by hand – and the practice of cleaning sewers and septic tanks though experts point out that the latter is a mere extension of the now-banned practice. Activists and experts condemned the government’s response and said the distinction between manual scavenging and people dying in sewers was not practical.“We have always said this is a technicality. This amounts to manipulating data,” said Magsaysay awardee and Safai Karmachari Andolan founder Bezwada Wilson.“The major problem is that the government is not understanding the importance of human dignity and self respect of the most marginalised. This is barbaric. The right to life and dignity is the responsibility of the government,” he said. Dalit activist Ashok Bharati said cleaning sewers and septic tanks was included in the 2013 law and therefore should be considered manual scavenging. “The government should take this up,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-manual-scavenging-deaths-941-died-while-cleaning-sewers-govt-101628105749227.html
05-08-2021||India||Four ISRO launches over next 5 months; Gaganyaan delayed, Centre tells LS||New Delhi: The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will conduct four launches over the next five months, including the maiden flight of its new small satellite launch vehicle. The much-awaited first uncrewed flight under the Gaganyaan mission, however, is no longer on the cards, the government told the Lok Sabha. The space agency had to reassess the timelines for all its missions due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Prior to that, India was to conduct the first uncrewed flight under the Gaganyaan mission by December 2021. The four upcoming launches include three using India’s workhorse Polar Satellite Launch Vehicles (PSLV), according to a reply in the Lok Sabha. All the four missions will carry on board earth observation satellites, which are used for monitoring agricultural activities and natural disasters among others. So far, there has only been one launch this year in February when PSLV C51 carried the Brazilian Earth Observation Satellite Amazonia-1 to space in a commercial launch. The vehicle also carried 18 co-passengers – 13 satellites from the US, one from the defence research and development organisation (DRDO), a three-satellite combination from a university consortium, and an experimental nano-satellite developed by students. HT had previously reported that the launch of EOS-3 is likely by mid-August. “The dates will be confirmed closer to the launch,” said an official from the space agency. The first development flight of the small satellite launch vehicle (SSLV) is likely to happen in the last quarter of the year. ISRO inducts a launch vehicle in its operation fleet after two successful development flights. The SSLV, which was mainly developed for commercial launch of small satellites, costs only R 30 crore as compared to Rs120 crore for PSLV. It can be assembled by a team of six within seven days in comparison to a team of 600 that takes a couple of months to assemble a PSLV. Ajay Lele, a senior fellow at Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, had earlier said that there was a need to carry out the commercial missions such as small satellite launch vehicle demonstration as soon as possible as customer satellites already purchased slots for launch. “The scientific missions can wait for some time. If India does not provide launch services there is a likelihood that they might go to other launch providers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-isro-launches-over-next-5-months-gaganyaan-delayed-centre-tells-lok-sabha-101628105448717.html
05-08-2021||India||India again kept out of extended troika meeting on Afghanistan convened by Russia||India has again been kept out of a key meeting on Afghanistan convened by Russia that will see the participation of Pakistan, reflecting certain divergences between New Delhi and Moscow on the rapidly evolving situation in the war-torn country. The “extended troika” meeting, to be held in Qatar on August 11, will be joined by special envoys from Russia, the US, China and Pakistan. Qatar will host another meeting between the Afghan side and regional and international partners this month. The extended troika meeting was called by Russia to push intra-Afghan talks to find a political settlement in Afghanistan at a time when the Taliban have launched a massive offensive that has recently been expanded to cities such as Kandahar, Herat and Lashkargah. The extended troika held its last two meetings in Moscow on March 18 and in Doha on April 30. The Indian side has taken up the inclusion of Pakistan – which New Delhi contends is backing the Taliban – at these meetings with the Russian side, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. Russia has said it keeps India informed about all developments under the troika format on Afghanistan, which includes the US and China, though it has shown little inclination of including India in discussions under the external troika even after acknowledging India’s stakes in Afghanistan, the people cited above said. While India has backed the government of President Ashraf Ghani and is in talks with other stakeholders in Afghanistan, it has repeatedly opposed the imposition of any regime by force. However, the Russian side appears opposed to the continuation of the Ghani government and favours an interim set-up. “Russia perceives Ghani as a US proxy and wants him removed. At the same time, Russia believes the Taliban will counter the Islamic State, which Russia sees as its main threat in Afghanistan, if the group comes to power. This is one of the reasons for Russia’s growing coordination with Pakistan,” one of the persons cited above said. An explanation by Russia’s special presidential envoy for Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, for keeping India out of the extended troika has not gone down well in New Delhi. Kabulov, who also oversees relations with India, told a recent online discussion that Russia only sees a role for India in “Afghanistan’s post-conflict development” as the country has no influence with the Taliban. “Only countries that have an unequivocal influence on both sides (of the conflict in Afghanistan) participate” in the extended troika, Kabulov said. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov’s decision to club a visit to India in April with a trip to Pakistan – a move that reflected the growing ties between Moscow and Islamabad – also did not go down well with the Indian side. Lavrov’s move is believed to have led the Indian side to club a visit by the foreign minister to Georgia, which has strained ties with Russia, with a trip to Moscow in June. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said India had kept away from engaging the Taliban because of its own terrorism-related experiences while other stakeholders had engaged the group for the sake of political expediency. “India’s exclusion from the extended troika and Kabulov’s remarks are a necessary cost of that lack of engagement. However, India has overcome its reservations in the last few months and made attempts to reach out to Taliban, but it will take more time for India to gain the necessary heft,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-again-kept-out-of-extended-troika-meeting-on-afghanistan-convened-by-russia-101628105269003.html
05-08-2021||India||2 years after abrogation of Art 370, louder calls for statehood||NEW DELHI: Two years after the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two separate Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, there is a demand growing there for the restoration of statehood. It is significant for Ladakh to have demanded this given its long quest for UT status that had finally materialised in 2019. The reorganisation of the state on August 5, 2019, included the reading down of articles 370 and 35(A) that gave the erstwhile state its special status and the mandate to define its domicile rules that also laid down conditions for employment. The UT of Jammu and Kashmir has a legislature, but the UT of Ladakh doesn’t have one. While there is no unanimous demand for the restoration of the special status J&K enjoyed, with only regional parties such as the National Conference and People’s Democratic Party challenging the abrogation of the articles in court, political parties are united in their demand for the restoration of statehood. Barring the Bharatiya Janata Party at the national level, all the other parties have demanded the restoration of statehood before the delimitation exercise gets over, which is mandatory for the holding of elections according to the reorganisation law. However, the local unit of the BJP is in favour of restoring statehood even though it was at the forefront of demanding the abrogation of the articles 370 and 35 (A). “It is a promise that the Prime Minister has made, and we want him to fulfil it. There is a concern in Jammu that even post reorganisation little has changed on the ground vis-à-vis development in the region. Then there is also the concern that taking advantage of loopholes in the law, outsiders can grab the land in Jammu as they will find the (security) situation more conducive here than in the Kashmir Valley,” said a local BJP leader on condition of anonymity. BJP spokesperson Anil Gupta, however, said that the party is more focused on the delimitation process needed for elections. “Once a legitimate government is in place, the Union government, depending on the situation, will consider the restoration of statehood. As of today, their demand has no meaning because the PM has already assured that it will be done. The opposition parties just keep shifting the goalpost; first they did not support reorganisation and now they have problems with the delimitation,” Gupta said. At an all party meeting on June 24, PM Narendra Modi had stressed on the need for stronger grassroots democracy and the importance of conducting elections in J&K, stating his commitment to restoring the region’s statehood, and urging mainstream leaders to participate in the ongoing delimitation exercise. “Our priority is to strengthen grassroots democracy in J&K. Delimitation has to happen at a quick pace so that polls can happen and J&K gets an elected government that gives strength to J&K’s development trajectory,” Modi had tweeted shortly after the meeting. But the regional satraps who raised the demand for restoration of statehood are not convinced by the Union government’s assurance. Former MP and NC leader Hasnain Masoodi said the reorganisation and the scrapping of the special status was done “citing reasons that are far from reality”. “Kashmir was way ahead of many states in the country on several human development indices. Second, the assurances that we were given about the changes that will take place after August 5 have not yielded results. There is only uncertainty,” he said. Masoodi said the Union government’s claims of introducing a three-tier administrative set-up by conducting district development council elections do not compensate for the lack of elected representatives. “Most of the DDC functionaries are in protective custody and cannot even meet people,” he said. In Ladakh where the Kargil and the Leh divisions have buried their differences over the reorganisation, the demand for statehood has stemmed from concerns that the Union government is yet to sanction a protective law such as bringing the region under Schedule VI of the Constitution to offer protection of land, jobs, environment, culture and language that existed prior to the formation of the UT. Former BJP MP Thupstan Chhewang earlier told HT that the demand for legislature was raised because the Centre had “failed to offer protection” to the people by reserving jobs and ensuring land rights. He went on to add that both the Leh and Kargil divisions were pushing for protection under the Sixth Schedule or a separate schedule of the Constitution for safeguarding the interests of the residents of Ladakh fearing that with domicile rules not defined, land and government jobs would be available to outsiders depriving the residents, a large percentage of whom are from the Scheduled Tribes. Last week, Chhewang who heads the Apex Committee of Peoples’ Movement of Ladakh along with Asgar Ali Karbali, the co-chair of the Kargil Democratic Alliance, pushed for complete restoration of statehood and two additional Lok Sabha seats from Ladakh. For its part, the Union government has underlined that the process of restoration of statehood would follow delimitation and elections. “The political parties have been explicitly told that there will be no change in the process. They are needlessly trying to stoke fears that delimitation will change the demography of the region. The Act says seven seats are to be added to take the total strength of the assembly from 107 to114. It will be done by the delimitation commission in a scientific way, keeping in mind the size of the constituency and the population. But the regional parties first boycotted it, then spread misgivings,” said a senior government official not wishing to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-years-after-bifurcation-of-j-k-both-uts-demand-statehood-101628105027518.html

The labourers, who were employed to work on the doubling of the railway track from Vasco to Karnataka, which is being staunchly opposed by environmental and anti-coal activists, were allegedly found to be staying next to the railway track in unhygienic conditions, without proper shelter and toilet.“Some of the labourers were found to be as old as 72 years. The labourers complained about not receiving minimum wages, restrictions regarding returning home, no ESI - Provident Fund,” Arun Pandey of Anyay Rahit Zindagi, an NGO associated with their rescue, said. The labourers were living along with their children in the makeshift shanties near the railway track.Local officials said the labour contractor who arranged the labourers on behalf of the company contracted by the railways has been booked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/14-labourers-employed-on-rail-project-rescued-from-bonded-labour-goa-official-101628104487477.html

The ground floor of the temple, where the sanctum sanctorum will be located and where an idol of Ram Lalla will be placed, will be ready for prayers by December 2023 and arrangements are being made to streamline the process of providing security clearances and installing public amenities, said another person aware of the details.The temple complex, which is expected to incur a cost of ₹900-1,000 crore and will be spread over 110 acres of land, is being built by Larsen & Toubro while Tata Consulting Engineers has been signed on as the project management consultant. The temple complex will also have a museum, a research centre, and an archival centre.“The temple trust has already received donations in the excess of ₹3,000 crore. And this amount is excluding donations from non-resident Indians as foreign donations are not yet permitted,” said the first person quoted above.The work is on to fill the excavation that was carried out on the land parcel. Given the composition of the soil, the construction technique to ensure the stability of the structure involved excavating 12 metres or nearly three storeys below the ground.Earlier in 2019, the Supreme Court had handed over the site for the building of a Ram temple after years of litigation following the razing of the 16th-century Babri Masjid in 1992.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-temple-likely-to-open-for-public-by-december-2023-101628103287292.html
05-08-2021||India||Dr Subbiah murder case: Seven get death penalty, life term for 2||A sessions court on Wednesday awarded death penalty to seven, including two lawyers, out of the 10 accused for the murder of neurologist Dr SD Subbiah on September 14, 2013. The city trial court judge I S Alli, also sentenced two others to life imprisonment while one accused turned approver was released without punishment. On the evening of September 14, 2013, henchmen murdered the 58-year-old doctor in full public view while he was walking out of Chennai’s Billroth Hospital towards his parked car after his work. A land dispute with his family over a 2.4-acre plot at the doctor’s native Anjugramam village in Tamil Nadu’s Kanyakumari district led to the crime. Three people wielding machetes had attacked the doctor on his head, neck and he suffered more than 20 cuts across his body. CCTV cameras installed at a nearby apartment captured the brutal attack. Nine days later, the doctor succumbed to his injuries. Special Public Prosecutor N Vijayaraj in his final arguments asked for capital punishment to be awarded to all the accused in the case for plotting and murder. The sessions judge on Wednesday sentenced Ponnusamy, Basil, Boris, B William, James Satish Kumar, Murugan and Selva Prakash to double capital punishment for offences under Sections 302 (murder) and 120B (party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable with death) of IPC. The other two accused, Mary Pushpam and Yesurajan, have been sentenced to double life terms. One of the convicts, William, is an advocate whose bail petition was rejected by the Supreme Court in May 2018. Prosecutor Vijayaraj had at that time submitted a petition in court to declare William as proclaimed offender as he had been absconding with his family members. William surrendered in August that year and was remanded to judicial custody. One of the accused, P Iyyapan who turned approver in 2018 and became a prosecution witness during the trial was allowed to go free without any punishment. Iyyapan had confessed that he along with Murugan and Selvaprakash had hacked the doctor. After the court found the accused guilty, the wife of the deceased, Shanthi Subbiah flanked by her daughters poignantly told the media that the judiciary did a tremendous job and she hoped that this would be an example to deter such crimes. “This is a very emotional and private moment for us,” Shanthi said. “In those nine days, he was semi-conscious, I’m sure he would have only thought about me and his two unmarried daughters. We are not going to get him back, but today’s verdict is some consolation. My husband believed in the judiciary and so did we. Today’s verdict shows that our trust in the judiciary hasn’t gone in vain. It’s a little late but never too late to get justice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dr-subbiah-murder-case-seven-get-death-penalty-life-term-for-2-101628103166039.html

Quoting sources in the BSNL, the report states that the number was registered in the name of the retired top court judge, who now heads the National Human Rights Commission, from September 18, 2010 to September 19, 2018. Mishra told The Wire that he had not used the number since 2013-14.The Wire report added that the mobile numbers of Supreme Court registry officials NK Gandhi and TI Rajput, both now retired, also featured on the list of potential targets.The numbers of three lawyers, Aljo Joseph, Vjiay Aggarwal and M Thangathurai, are also reported to be in the list. While Joseph is the lawyer for AgustaWestland accused Christian Michel before Delhi courts, Aggarwal has been representing PNB scam accused Nirav Modi. Thangathurai has been associated with and working in former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi’s office for several years.On Thursday, an SC bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana will consider a bunch of nine petitions seeking a court-monitored independent investigation into the alleged snooping and to identify the entities responsible for this. Those who filed the petitions include lawyer, journalists and activists.The purported surveillance campaign spans several countries and experts and activists say the suspects are nation-states since NSO Group has maintained that it only sells to government clients for what it says is lawful interception meant to combat crime.A consortium of 17 news organisations have reported on what is known as the Pegasus Project. The targets include heads of states, activists, politicians, journalists and even scientists. In India, the issue has become the main reason for parliament’s ongoing monsoon session as the government has resisted the opposition’s demands for a probe.The Union government has denied allegations related to the controversy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/number-linked-to-ex-sc-judge-lawyers-on-latest-pegasus-list-101628102986003.html
05-08-2021||India||Tighten curbs ahead of festivals: Centre to states||The Centre on Wednesday asked the states to consider imposing local-level curbs during forthcoming festivals to prevent superspreader events. This came as 18 districts reported an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases, and India’s reproduction number (the number of people one infected person can infect) increasing to 1.2 from a low of 0.6.“In view of upcoming festivals such as Muharram, Onam, Janmashtami, Ganesh Chaturthi, and Durga Puja where large public gatherings are expected, it is advised that states may actively consider imposition of local restrictions in public observation of these festivals and curb mass gatherings,” read the letter by Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan addressed to all state chief secretaries.Meanwhile, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya wrote to Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to implement measures suggested by the central team of experts led by the National Centre for Disease Control that had visited the state recently. The minister suggested that Kerala follow stringent containment measures instead of the ABCD classification of districts based on the test-positivity rate that determines the level of activities allowed.Kerala was also asked to improve contact tracing, increase more accurate RT-PCR tests, prevent intra-house transmission from Covid-19 patients who remain in home isolation, and augment the health infrastructure. The state was also asked to send samples of all breakthrough infections to Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium labs for genome sequencing.The state had the lowest sero-prevalence of just over 44% as per the national study, meaning the state has one of the highest susceptible populations.The state was also asked to send samples of all breakthrough infections for sequencing as the central team found that Pathanamthitta was reporting a high number of breakthrough infections.On Wednesday, Kerala reported 22,414 cases with a test positivity rate of 11.37% and logged 108 new deaths.State health minister Veena George told the legislative assembly on Wednesday that the severity of the disease was on a decline and that economic activities and containment measures will need to go hand-in-hand. “Occupancy of hospital beds and oxygen beds [has] decreased considerably. Hospitals are not facing unusual rush or pressure...the severity of the disease is coming down,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tighten-covid-curbs-ahead-of-festivals-centre-tells-states-101628102866823.html
05-08-2021||India||TN to provide 7.5% quota for govt students in professional courses||Tamil Nadu on Wednesday announced that the government would extend the 7.5% reservation to government school students for admissions into professional courses like engineering, agriculture and law. A cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister MK Stalin on Wednesday decided to table this legislation during the ensuing budget session. This was based on the recommendation of the justice (retired) D Murugesan committee, which was constituted by the DMK soon after it formed the government to address the issue of government school students getting into professional courses. “To implement the recommendation of the commission, it has been decided to introduce a bill in the upcoming session itself to provide 7.5% reservation to students of government schools in admission to professional courses like the 7.5% quota for medical admission,” said a statement from the government.Last year, the AIADMK during its regime introduced a 7.5% horizontal reservation to government school students, who cleared the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for admissions into undergraduate medical colleges. Tamil Nadu follows a caste-based reservation policy of 69%. The composition of the 69% reservation in Tamil Nadu is -- Backward Caste (BC)- 30% (26.5% + 3.5% internal reservation for Muslims. In the 90s, BC Muslims were part of the BCs, which was made separate during the DMK regime in 2007), Most Backward Caste (MBC)- 20% (10.5% for Vanniyars, 7% for Denotified Communities (28 castes) and 2.5% for others (41 castes), Scheduled Castes- 18% (15%+ Arunthathiyars 3%) and Scheduled Tribes- 1 %.The Cabinet also decided to present a full revised budget on August 13. Prior to that, finance minister Palanivel Thiagarajan will release a white paper on the state’s finances on August 9, which will show details of revenue, debt, etc of the last ten years of the AIADMK regime. Former finance minister O Panneerselvam presented an interim budget earlier in February ahead of the assembly elections. The new government will also present a separate budget for the agriculture department at the session. The government is also planning to go digital and make this a paperless budget.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-to-provide-7-5-quota-for-govt-students-in-professional-courses-101628102808002.html

A state with mere 3 per cent of the country’s population, Kerala has been accounting for more than half of the total cases of the country for several days in a row.The total cases have now reached 3,471,563, with the number of people succumbing to the virus rising to 17,211 after 108 more deaths. Malappuram continued to top the chart with 3.691 cases, followed by Thrissur (2912), Ernakulam (2,663), Kozhikode (2,502), Palakkad (1,928), Kollam (1,527), Kannur (1,299), Kottayam (1,208) and Thiruvananthapuram (1155).In the case of fatality rate, vaccination, tests and trace and track surveillance mechanism the state is way ahead but it bogged down by the double-digit test positivity rate for more than a month. Lauded during the first wave, the unending second wave has spoiled its records, statistics show. And some experts have also issued a third wave warning. “The consistent surge indicates that this may be the beginning of a fresh wave. You name it second or third wave it is fact cases are going up alarmingly,” said public health expert Dr S S Lal who earlier worked with the World Health Organisation. Internal medicine expert Dr N M Arun has been studying the case trajectory of the state. “The state going through a fresh wave and if cases rise like this system will drain,” he said. Out of 18 worst affected districts in the country 10 are in the state. Malappuram is the worst hit district in the state with an average TPR of 15 per cent for the past five days. The district has also an active caseload of 21,603 as of Tuesday and its recovery rate is also slow. Opposition parties in the state have blamed the Pinarayi Vijayan-led CPI (M) government for the surge in cases, even alleging Bakrid relaxations led to the condition worsening in the state. However, statistics show that this was not a sudden hike. Six district have averaged TPR in double digits for more than a week. What worry experts is that cases remain steady in these districts and most infections are taking place during home isolation. The central team that visited the state also expressed serious reservations over lax home quarantine. The state’s low seropositivity rate is another serious concern -- around 50 per cent of the population is still susceptible to the virus, says the latest serosurvey. “Since half of the population is not affected, we have to vaccinate them on a war footing. We are in touch with the Union government,” said health minister Veena George. Despite the high volume of cases, pressure is not visible on the overworked health system. Out of 4,250 ICC beds and ventilators (both private and public), 2300 are occupied --1500 are crucially ill and 800 are on ventilator support, according to the state health ministry. And it has 250 metric tonne oxygen in stock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-reports-over-22k-new-cases-spike-catches-experts-off-guard-101628102749391.html
05-08-2021||India||AIADMK, DMK at loggerheads again||A period of amiability between the DMK and AIADMK parties in Tamil Nadu seems to be winding up as the ruling and opposition parties have begun cold-shouldering one another.The latest incident that aggravated the tension between the Dravidian majors is the AIADMK boycotting an important state event on Monday when President Ram Nath Kovind commemorated the centenary celebrations of the Madras Legislative Council, where he unveiled a portrait of late DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi.On Tuesday, DMK’s water resources minister S Duraimurugan revealed that he rang up former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami to personally invite him to attend the event on chief minister M K Stalin’s instruction. Stalin had also decided to reserve a chair for Palaniswami so he could be seated along with the President and governor Banwarilal Purohit on the dais. “I conveyed these details to him,” Duraimurugan told reporters in the secretariat. “He said he will consult his party and respond but he didn’t tell me anything while he informed the Assembly Secretary that AIADMK will not participate.”The AIADMK skipped the event saying that the DMK had boycotted a similar event when they had unveiled J Jayalalithaa’s portrait in 2018. “She’s a global leader and we invited them just like they have invited us now. But why did they boycott then? They didn’t respect our party,” said AIADMK spokesperson and former minister D Jayakumar. “In 2012, when Amma (Jayalalithaa) was the chief minister, diamond jubilee celebrations were conducted, in which Pranab Mukherjee had participated. But they (DMK) didn’t participate in that either.”He added that the AIADMK celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2012 as the first assembly was set up in Tamil Nadu in 1952 while the legislative council was established in 1921. Due to all this utter confusion, our party decided to stay away,” Jayakumar said. The AIADMK’s ally the BJP was present at the event.Tamil Nadu isn’t a place of usual bitter politicking. For more than 50-years, from the time MG Ramachandran (MGR) founded ADMK (later AIADMK), by breaking away from the DMK, the state has seen politics of hatred between the leaders of the two parties, which was elevated when Jayalalithaa succeeded him MGR. Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi never saw eye-to-eye and she had even jailed him in a dramatic midnight arrest a month after she came to power in 2001.This transformed into a healthier political culture after Stalin, Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam took over the respective parties. Despite a heated political campaign, Palaniswami graciously accepted the election results and Panneerselvam attended the DMK’s swearing-in. Post the event, Panneerselvam was seated along with Stalin, something that was unprecedented in Tamil Nadu.This began to go back to square one after the three-month-old DMK government, via the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC), raided former AIADMK transport minister M R Vijayabhaskar on July 22, and filed a case of disproportionate wealth. This got the AIADMK jittery as it was seen as the beginning of a crackdown. The DMK had promised in its election manifesto to establish a special court for trying AIADMK ex-ministers on corruption charges. Soon after the raid, Palaniswami and Panneerselvam flew to Delhi to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi where this was discussed, according to the AIADMK leaders privy to the meeting. After returning, the AIADMK conducted a state-wide protest against the DMK for not abolishing NEET and not cutting fuel prices as they had promised. The protest didn’t have much traction with the public, but it was more of a booster for the party cadre, amid expelled AIADMK leader V K Sasikala trying to make her way into the party.This also comes ahead of ensuing local body elections, where polls in nine districts will be held in September as per a Supreme Court order and the remaining will be held later this year.Political experts also say while the political exchange was respectful, it has gone back to the old ways. “Ugly politics is raising its head once again,” says political commentator Durai Karunanidhi. “After elections, Tamil Nadu was looking like Delhi’s political culture where they will fight inside the parliament but once outside they will be friendly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-dmk-at-loggerheads-again-101628102748192.html
05-08-2021||India||Covid negative report mandatory to visit public places: Kerala govt||The Kerala government on Wednesday allowed shops and business to open six days a week but has made it mandatory for people – staff as well as visitors – to have taken at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine or prove that they tested negative on an RT-PCR test before they can enter any such establishment.The state alone accounts for half of all new Covid-19 infections being recorded in the country and is going through what experts believe is a delayed second wave. The weekend curfew will now apply only to Sunday.People seeking to enter public spaces can also show result of a positive test at least a month old.Kerala is the first state to enforce such stringent provisions, inviting sharp reactions from traders and others. “It is very difficult to meet such restrictions. It will not serve any purpose. We will go back to the government,” said T Nasaruddin, state merchants’ association leader. Many like him also asked the state to provide enough vaccination before insisting on vaccine certificates.To avoid crowding, all shops can function from 7 am to 9 pm. According to the order, people will be allowed inside the shop only on the basis of the shopping area (one person per 25 sq ft.). Hotels and restaurants will only be allowed to deliver food and public transport vehicles must enforce strict distancing and mask discipline, said the new guidelines issued on Wednesday.On Wednesday, Kerala reported 22,414 cases with a test positivity rate of 11.37% and logged 108 new deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-ve-report-mandatory-to-visit-public-places-kerala-govt-101628102687298.html
05-08-2021||India||Two years after Article 370 move, louder calls for statehood||Two years after the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, there is a growing demand for the restoration of statehood in both places. It is significant for Ladakh to have demanded this given its long quest for UT status had finally materialised in 2019.The reorganisation of the state on August 5, 2019, included the effective nullification of Articles 370 and 35(A) that gave the erstwhile state its special status and the mandate to define its domicile rules that also laid down conditions for employment. The UT of Jammu and Kashmir has a legislature, but Ladakh doesn’t have one.Prominent regional parties such as the National Conference and Peoples Democratic Party have challenged the nullification of the region’s special status in court and have called for its restoration. But there is greater unity among parties in their demand for the restoration of statehood. Barring the Bharatiya Janata Party at the national level, all the other parties have demanded the restoration of statehood before the delimitation exercise gets over, which is mandatory for the holding of elections, according to the reorganisation law.However, the local unit of the BJP is in favour of restoring statehood even though it was at the forefront of demanding the nullification of the articles 370 and 35 (A).“It is a promise that the Prime Minister has made, and we want him to fulfil it. There is a concern in Jammu that even post reorganisation little has changed on the ground vis-à-vis development in the region. Then there is also the concern that taking advantage of loopholes in the law, outsiders can grab the land in Jammu as they will find the (security) situation more conducive here than in the Kashmir Valley,” a local BJP leader said on condition of anonymity.BJP spokesperson Anil Gupta, however, said the party is more focused on the delimitation process needed for the polls. “Once a legitimate government is in place, the Union government, depending on the situation, will consider the restoration of statehood. As of today, their demand has no meaning because the PM has already assured that it will be done. The opposition parties just keep shifting the goalpost; first they did not support reorganisation and now they have problems with the delimitation.”At an all-party meeting on June 24, PM Narendra Modi stressed on the need for stronger grassroots democracy and the importance of conducting elections in J&K, stating his commitment to restoring the region’s statehood, and urging mainstream leaders to participate in the delimitation exercise.“Our priority is to strengthen grassroots democracy in J&K. Delimitation has to happen at a quick pace so that polls can happen and J&K gets an elected government that gives strength to J&K’s development trajectory,” Modi tweeted shortly after the meeting. But the regional satraps who raised the demand for restoration of statehood are not convinced by the Centre’s assurance.Former MP and National Conference leader Hasnain Masoodi said the reorganisation and the scrapping of the special status was done “citing reasons far from reality”.“Kashmir was way ahead of many states in the country on several human development indices. Second, the assurances that we were given about the changes that will take place after August 5 have not yielded results. There is only uncertainty,” he said.Masoodi said the Centre’s claims of introducing a three-tier administrative set-up by conducting district development council elections do not compensate for the lack of elected representatives. “Most of the DDC functionaries are in protective custody and cannot even meet people,” he said.In Ladakh where the Kargil and the Leh divisions have buried their differences over the reorganisation, the demand for statehood has stemmed from concerns that the Union government is yet to sanction a protective law such as bringing the region under Schedule VI of the Constitution to offer protection of land, jobs, environment, culture and language that existed prior to the formation of the UT.Former BJP MP Thupstan Chhewang earlier told HT that the demand for legislature was raised because the Centre had “failed to offer protection” to the people by reserving jobs and ensuring land rights. He went on to add that both the Leh and Kargil divisions were pushing for protection under the Sixth Schedule or a separate schedule of the Constitution for safeguarding the interests of the residents of Ladakh fearing that with domicile rules not defined, land and government jobs would be available to outsiders depriving the residents, a large percentage of whom are from the Scheduled Tribes.Last week, Chhewang who heads the Apex Committee of Peoples’ Movement of Ladakh along with Asgar Ali Karbali, the co-chair of the Kargil Democratic Alliance, pushed for complete restoration of statehood and two additional Lok Sabha seats from Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-years-after-article-370-move-louder-calls-for-statehood-101628102169211.html
05-08-2021||India||No data on internet shutdowns: Centre||The Union government said it does not have information about internet shutdowns in the country, as per a response by the ministry of communications, which cited information from the ministry of home affairs to say that the Centre does not collate such records since it pertains to law and order and falls in the domain of states.The ministry was responding to questions by Congress Lok Sabha members Shashi Tharoor and Gaurav Gogoi, who sought details of how many times and for what reason internet services were curtailed in India over the last three years. “States are responsible and empowered to issue orders for temporary suspension of internet service to maintain law and order in the State. Ministry of home affairs has informed that records pertaining to internet shutdowns ordered by states/UTs are not centrally maintained by MHA,” the communications ministry said in its reply.The Congress MPs also sought to know the economic impact of such shutdowns but the ministry said it had no mechanism to assess socio-economic impact of internet shutdowns. However, it added: “The contribution of internet for the well-being of citizens has to be balanced with social platforms being misused by anti-social elements requiring temporary shutdowns as per rules based on the assessment by local authorities”.Tharoor shared a screenshot of the ministry response on Twitter and said that in 2020, internet shutdowns in parts of India went on for 8,927 hours and cost the taxpayers $2.8bn. “As usual, the Govt has no data on issues that matter… Why is the govt so afraid of the internet and the freedom it bestows on citizens? Alarming, undemocratic, unsurprising.”Experts said the stand violates judicial directions. Raman Jit Singh Chima, senior international counsel and the Asia Pacific Policy director at Access Now, said that it was shocking that the MHA or their colleagues in the ministry of telecom did not have data on rules they are governing.“Supreme Court had directed the Centre to review the rules by which internet shutdown had been ordered in Jammu and Kashmir in the Anuradha Bhasin case in 2020. If they haven’t reviewed the impact, they wouldn’t have reviewed the rules either. That is contempt of the Supreme Court,” he said. Internet shutdowns are governed by the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services Rules 2017 which stipulates that internet shutdowns can only be valid for 15 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-data-on-internet-shutdowns-centre-101628102385866.html
05-08-2021||India||Centre proposes hiking compensation amount for ‘hit and run’ cases to ₹2 lakh||The Union road transport and highways ministry has proposed a scheme to increase the compensation amount for the families of hit-and-run road accident victims. According to the new plan, ₹2 lakh will be provided to the families of persons whose lives are claimed during such accidents instead of the current ₹25,000, news agency PTI reported.In case of serious injuries, the compensation amount will be increased to ₹50,000 from ₹25,000. The draft scheme was notified by the ministry on August 2.As many as 4,49,002 road accidents had occurred in India in 2019, which led to the deaths of 1,51,113 individuals, official data revealed, PTI reported.The Scheme for Compensation of Hit and Run Accident victims seeks to enhance "compensation (from ₹12,500 to ₹50,000 for grievous hurt and from ₹25,000 to ₹2,00,000 for death)," an official statement said on Wednesday.The statement further stated that the new scheme will “supersede the earlier Solatium Scheme, 1989".The draft scheme has also laid down a complete procedure for a detailed probe into cases of road accidents, Detailed Accident Report (DAR) and its reporting besides timelines for different stakeholders for quick settlements of claims, the PTI report added.The central government will also establish a Motor Vehicles Accident Fund that will be used for providing compensation in case of hit and run accidents and treatment of the victims.During the ongoing monsoon session of the Parliament, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari informed the Rajya Sabha that a total of 536 persons were killed and 1,655 persons were injured in accidents classified under 'hit and run' in Delhi in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-proposes-hiking-compensation-amount-for-hit-and-run-cases-to-rs-2-lakh-101628102009672.html
05-08-2021||India||Stalemate in House due to ‘arrogant’ government, says Opposition||The stalemate in Parliament is because of an “arrogant” and “obdurate” government, 19 Opposition leaders said in a statement, even as disruptions and protests over the Pegasus snooping controversy, the contentious farm reforms, and spiralling fuel prices roiled both Houses.“The responsibility for the deadlock lies squarely at the doorsteps of the government, which remains arrogant and obdurate,” said the statement signed by Mallikarjun Kharge and Anand Sharma (Congress), Sharad Pawar (Nationalist Congress Party), TR Balu and Tiruchi Siva (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam), Ramgopal Yadav (Samajwadi Party), Derek O’Brien and Kalyan Banerjee (Trinamool Congress), Vinayak Raut ( Shiv Sena), Manoj Jha (Rashtriya Janata Dal), Elamaran Kareem (CPIM), Sushil Gupta (Aam Aadmi Party), ET Mohd Basheer ( Indian Union Muslim League), Hasnain Masoodi (National Conference), Binoy Viswam ( CPI), NK Premachandran (RSP) and MV Shreyams Kumar (LJD). “The Opposition parties stand firm and united on their demand for a discussion on Pegasus issue in both the Houses, replied by the home minister, as this has a national security dimension,” it added.Asking the government to “respect parliamentary democracy and accept the discussions”, the parties also emphasised that they remain united and accused the government over “misleading campaign” to “malign the Opposition for the disruptions”.“The Opposition has unequivocally conveyed that the discussions on the farmers laws and the agitation arising out of the three anti-farmer and black agri-laws should follow the discussion on Pegasus.”“It is unfortunate that the government has unleashed misleading campaign to malign the combined Opposition and blaming it for the continued disruption in Parliament,” the statement added, responding to comments made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a meeting of Bharatiya Janata Party lawmakers, where he said the Opposition was insulting Parliament.With no end to the stalemate in sight, the opposition parties held two strategy meetings on Wednesday to chalk out their future course, even as they are running out of options.The first meeting, held at 10am discussed the day’s plan and decided to continue protests. The second meeting, held after the six Trinamool MPs were suspended in Rajya Sabha, was quickly convened to maintain Opposition unity after some leaders felt the government was trying to create a divide.But with bills getting cleared amid the Opposition protests, and the government no longer keen to hold an all-party meeting to resolve the logjam, “the Opposition parties are caught in a bind,” said a senior leader present in both meetings.“We adopted a plan that whenever a member would be called to speak on any bill, we would quickly mention our demands on Pegasus, farm laws and price hike. But as soon as we try to raise these issues, the microphone is turned off,” said CPI(M)’s Elamaram Kareem.The Opposition has also protested against the decision to black out their protests on the Rajya Sabha TV and Lok Sabha TV. “As soon as we go to the Well, or start protesting in demand for a debate on Pegasus, the cameras only show the Chair,” said a second Opposition leader.Disruptions have always been blocked out, said officials in Parliament.The second Opposition meeting also discussed the way notices of only three parties on the farmers’ issues were approved in the Rajya Sabha while the other notices were rejected. “We decided that the three parties, AAP, SP and CPI(M), will withdraw their notices to avoid such partiality,” said a third Opposition leader.Rajya Sabha officials pointed out that since all notices were of similar nature, three of them were accepted. “and, anyway, all members can participate in the debate.”After the House was adjourned, Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu met leaders of various parties and urged them to help the House return to normalcy so that it can discuss farmers’ issues, price rise and the economic situation in the country. There was no talk about a discussion on Pegasus.The government managers have not agreed to any discussion on Pegasus as they pointed out that the IT minister has already given a statement on the issue.“Some leaders have expressed concern to the Chairman over their loss of opportunity. Naidu today called them and explained how he has been trying to resolve the present stalemate in the House,” said a Rajya Sabha official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalemate-in-parliament-due-to-arrogant-govt-says-oppn-101628102267192.html
05-08-2021||India||OBC list: Centre moves to give states the power||The Centre will introduce in this session of Parliament a bill to restore the power of states to identify backward castes after it was cleared by the Union Cabinet on Wednesday, officials with knowledge of developments said, effectively bypassing a recent Supreme Court verdict that triggered protests in several states.On May 5, while scrapping a separate quota for the Maratha community in Maharashtra, the Supreme Court had ruled that after a 2018 amendment in the Constitution, only the central government could notify socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs) – not the states.This interpretation of the 102nd constitutional amendment -- which related to giving constitutional status to the National Commission of Backward Classes – effectively struck a blow to the authority of state governments in identifying backward classes and provide them with reservation benefits.Wednesday’s decision to bring the 127th Constitution Amendment Bill 2021 comes months before crucial polls in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, where other backward caste (OBC) groups hold sway. Last week, the Union government accepted a longstanding demand to introduce 27% reservation for OBC in medical and dental courses.The new bill effectively nullifies the top court’s decision, which triggered protests by state governments and OBC groups. In India, separate OBC lists are drawn up by the Centre and each state concerned.“The amendment is necessary to restore the powers of the state governments to maintain their list of OBCs which was taken away by a Supreme Court interpretation of Constitution (102) Amendment Act,’’ said a top government official who asked not to be identified. “If the state list was abolished, nearly 671 OBC communities would have lost access to reservation in educational institutions and in appointments one fifth of the community would have been impacted,’’ the official added.This marks the third time in as many years that the central government has brought legislation to effectively rollback a decision of the Supreme Court relating to lower castes.In 2018, the central government brought a bill to undo an apex court decision diluting some key provisions of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Prevention of Atrocities Act. The Supreme Court later upheld the amendments passed by Parliament.In 2019, months before the national elections, the government brought an ordinance to revert to an old system of allotting reserved positions in government educational institutions after the Supreme Court upheld an Allahabad high court order scrapping the earlier roster system. In both cases, the judicial decisions had touched off widespread protests.The official quoted above said the Cabinet decision meant that Parliament now has powers to make changes to the central OBC list. The National Commission of Backward castes (NCBC) will have the powers to look at complaints about implementation of various schemes that are meant for OBCs. “The move will uplift the status of backward castes,’’ the official said.The bill cleared by Cabinet sought to amend Clause 1 and 2 of Article 342 A of the Constitution that pertains to the President’s and Parliament’s powers to include or exclude or specify any tribe, in consultation with the governor in case of states. The new amendment will insert a new clause called 342 A (3) which will authorise states to maintain their own lists.On May 5, a five-judge bench -- comprising justices Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat -- scrapped the validity of the Maratha quota law that breached the 50% limit set by a landmark 1992 judgment.The ruling on depriving states of the power to identify SEBCs came by a majority of 3-2. Justices Bhushan and Nazeer said that states could still have their own list of SEBCs -- a view overruled by the majority that held state governments must rely on the Centre to include or exclude any community for granting reservation to SEBCs.The majority dismissed the Centre’s understanding of the amendments and arguments by attorney general (A-G) KK Venugopal that the 102nd amendment did not deprive state legislatures to enact laws determining the SEBCs and conferring benefits on them.Several states, including Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, also asserted their right under Articles 15(4) and 16(4) to make special provisions for SEBCs and give them quota.Both the Centre and states urged the court to lend credence to the parliamentary select committee report of 2017 and a statement of Union minister Thawarchand Gehlot on the floor of Parliament in August 2017 that the amendments did not affect the rights of the state governments to notify backward classes for reservation.But the majority judgment rejected this plea.On May 13, the Centre filed a review petition in the top court and contended that the May 5 judgment required a relook because there were errors apparent on the face of the record. The review petition was dismissed on July 1.Last week, the Union social justice ministry told Parliament that the Centre was consulting legal experts to “protect” the states’ powers to identify backward classes.Minister of social justice and empowerment Virendra Kumar told the Rajya Sabha last month that the government was in consultation with legal experts and the Ministry of Law and examining ways to protect the power of the states in determining the State list of OBCs.The minister said the “legislative intent” was reflected in the debates in Parliament when the amendment was passed and added that, “…it was declared unequivocally that the amendment wouldn’t impinge upon states’ powers to recognise and declare those classes in the state which were backward”.Jawaharlal Nehru University professor SS Jodhka said that the move was justified. “The reality of castes is states specific. For example, Jats may be dominant in one state but poor in the other, Valmikis are SC but in Andhra they are OBC and are Brahmins in parts of Maharashtra. Caste is also a relational category which means that it is state specific. State-specific categories should apply only for state jobs. So what they are doing is right,’’ he said. He also said that the constitutional status will ensure that their backward status will get legitimacy.JK Bajaj, who is a member of the OBC sub-categorisation commission, said that further clarity was needed on which lists of castes will be considered in order to prepare a sub-categorised list free of anomalies and repetitions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/obc-list-centre-moves-to-give-states-the-power-101628102265894.html

05-08-2021||India||These 4 Maharashtra districts have higher positivity rate than state itself||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said that coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in four districts of the state are not seeing any declining trend. These districts include Satara, Sahni, Kolhapur and Pune where the case positivity rate is also more than the state average, he told news agency ANI.“In these districts, our protocols of tracking, tracing and testing are continuing. Floods have affected the work,” Tope was quoted as saying.Maharashtra and Kerala continue to be most affected due to coronavirus, with the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) saying in a press briefing on Tuesday that 60 per cent of the country’s active caseload are from these states.Addressing the briefing, joint secretary of MoHFW, Lav Agarwal told media persons that as many as 18 districts in India – three from Maharashtra, are reporting 10 weekly average Covid-19 cases as of August 1. Of the 18 districts, 10 hail from Kerala and the remaining are situated in the northeast states of Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya, and Arunachal Pradesh.Meanwhile, the single-day coronavirus cases in Maharashtra yet again witnessed a spike on Wednesday as 6,126 infections were logged as opposed to Tuesday’s 6,005. The daily number of patients who succumbed to the virus also jumped from 177 on Tuesday to 195 on Wednesday, thereby taking the cumulative tally to 133,410, according to the health department’s bulletin data. The state’s overall Covid-19 tally currently stands at 63,27,194 whereas, with 7,436 fresh recoveries, the total number of recovered persons has reached 61,17,560.As far as Mumbai is concerned, the number of new cases saw a rise in the financial capital as well from Tuesday’s 291 infections to Wednesday’s 359. As many as nine patients lost their lives in the city on Wednesday, which is six more than Tuesday’s when three fatalities were reported.This development comes after Maharashtra on Monday declared relaxation of coronavirus protocols in 14 districts, some of which are effective in Mumbai as well. However, 11 districts, including three of the four that Tope mentioned on Wednesday, continue to be under Level 3 curbs due to high Covid-19 cases.On the other hand, floods in Maharashtra have claimed 219 lives alongside destroying crops, housing structures, electricity infrastructure and roads. The state government has announced a relief package of ₹11,500 crore for the damages that have ravaged 15 districts since July 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/these-4-maharashtra-districts-have-higher-positivity-rate-than-state-itself-101628099565616.html

I don’t want to hear this matter legally. But if the matter can be settled in mediation, please do that. Otherwise, we will have to send this matter to another bench,” Justice Ramana said then. To this, senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for the AP government, replied that he would have to speak to the competent authorities in the state government since it was a “political matter”.On Wednesday, advocate G Umapathy appeared for the Andhra government and informed the bench that the petition will have to be adjudicated by the court, indicating mediation was not the way forward.“We cannot force you if you don’t want mediation,” responded the CJI.At this, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Union government, said that the Centre has no objection to the CJI hearing the matter. But justice Ramana declined: “They don’t want mediation. How can I hear it? Let it go to another bench.”The Andhra government, in its petition, has complained that Telangana was refusing to follow decisions taken in the apex council constituted under the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, and directions of the Krishna River Management Board and those of the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/krishna-river-dispute-andhra-declines-mediation-cji-recuses-himself-101628101067458.html
05-08-2021||India||CBI takes over investigation into Dhanbad judge’s death||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday took over the investigation into the death of Dhanbad additional district judge Uttam Anand and formed a 20-member Special Investigation Team (SIT), days after the Supreme Court said the incident had larger ramifications for the independence of the judiciary.Anand died after he was hit by an auto-rickshaw while on a morning walk on July 28. The Jharkhand police have arrested two persons, Lakhan Verma and Rahul Verma, who were driving the vehicle they had allegedly stolen.The SIT, along with experts from the Central Forensics Science Laboratory (CFSL), “immediately” left for Dhanbad to collect all case files from Jharkhand police, interrogate the two suspects and collect other evidence in the case, people familiar with the developments said.The central agency has re-registered the first information report (FIR) filed by the Jharkhand police after receiving a notification from Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), according to an official who asked not to be named.The Supreme Court as well as the Jharkhand high court had taken suo motu cognisance of the incident last week after CCTV footage of the hit-and-run incident showed the three-wheeler deliberately swerving on an empty road to knock down the judge.The auto-rickshaw used in the incident was allegedly stolen from Dhanbad and later recovered from the neighbouring Giridih district.On July 30, the bench of Chief Justice NV Ramana and justice Surya Kant sought a complete report on the case from the Jharkhand chief secretary and the director general of police in a week.Registering the suo motu case as ‘In Re: Safeguarding Courts and Protecting Judges (Death of Additional Sessions Judge, Dhanbad)’, the court termed the incident “unfortunate”, adding: “This gruesome incident has been widely reported in newspapers, and video clippings of the incident are also being circulated on social media platforms, suggesting that it was not a case of simplicitor road accident.”The court said: “Having regard to the seriousness of the issue and its larger ramifications, we direct the chief secretary and director general of police, state of Jharkhand to jointly submit a status report of inquiry with the registry of this court within a week’s time.” CM Hemant Soren had suggested a CBI probe in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-takes-over-investigation-into-dhanbad-judge-s-death-101628100346403.html

The Taliban also launched a suicide attack on the residence of the Afghan defence minister in Kabul on Tuesday, killing eight people and injuring 20 more.“The Taliban attack on Salma Dam failed! #Terrorist Taliban attacked the #Salma Dam in Herat province to destroy it last night. But, fortunately they have suffered heavy casualties and fled the area as result of counter-attacks of #ANDSF,” Aman said in a tweet.The Salma Dam, also known as the Afghan-India Friendship Dam, is one of the most significant infrastructure projects undertaken by the Indian government in Afghanistan as part of its $3 billion reconstruction efforts. The dam on Hari river was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ashraf Ghani in June 2016.UNSC says it won’t back Taliban-run emirateThe United Nations Security Council on Tuesday condemned the deliberate and targeted attacks on civilians in Afghanistan and declared that it does “not support the restoration of the Islamic emirate” as the pre-2001 Taliban regime used to call itself.In a statement, the UNSC slammed the attack on a United Nations compound in Herat last week. It said that “deliberate attacks targeting civilians, UN personnel and UN compounds may constitute war crimes”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/afghan-troops-foil-another-attack-on-india-built-salma-dam-101628087863319.html
05-08-2021||India||India again kept out of extended troika meet on Afghanistan called by Russia||India has again been kept out of a key meeting on Afghanistan convened by Russia that will see the participation of Pakistan, reflecting divergences between New Delhi and Moscow on the rapidly evolving situation in the war-torn country.The “extended troika” meet, to be held in Qatar on August 11, will be joined by special envoys from Russia, the US, China and Pakistan. Qatar will host another meeting between the Afghan side and regional and international partners this month.The extended troika meeting was called by Russia to push intra-Afghan talks to find a political settlement in Afghanistan at a time when the Taliban have launched a massive offensive that has recently been expanded to cities such as Kandahar, Herat and Lashkargah.The extended troika held its last two meetings in Moscow on March 18 and in Doha on April 30. The Indian side has taken up the inclusion of Pakistan – which New Delhi contends is backing the Taliban – at these meetings with the Russian side, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.Russia has said it keeps India informed about developments on Afghanistan under the troika format, which includes the US and China, though it has shown little inclination of including India in discussions under the external troika even after acknowledging India’s stakes in Afghanistan, the people said.While India has backed the government of President Ashraf Ghani, it has repeatedly opposed the imposition of any regime by force. However, the Russian side appears opposed to the continuation of the Ghani government and favours an interim set-up||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-again-kept-out-of-extended-troika-meet-on-afghanistan-convened-by-russia-101628083722670.html
05-08-2021||India||2nd anniversary of abrogation of Art 370: PAGD slams BJP’s Naya Kashmir slogan||On the eve of the second anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union territories, the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) on Wednesday termed the Bharatiya Janata Party’s “Naya Kashmir” as a mere joke and questioned the aim behind the August 2019 move. “The hoax of BJP’s Naya Kashmir is a joke now. People have started questioning those in authority as (to) what they have achieved by destroying Kashmir which came into being through protracted historic struggle of the people of J&K,” PAGD spokesperson Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami said in a statement. The five-party alliance also alleged that the government had crossed all limits of constitutionality by demolishing the constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. “By demolishing the constitution of J&K, the government crossed all the limits of constitutionality. By downgrading a historic state and dividing it into two separate Union Territories without the consent of the people and also ignoring the resolution adopted by J&K legislature on March 3, 2004, to preserve the unity and the secular character of state, (the government) has set a precedent that any state can cease to exist as a state and can be carved up into any number of fragments any time, by placing it under the governor’s rule,” the statement read. On August 5, 2019, the Centre had abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution that gave Jammu and Kashmir a special status and bifurcated the state into two Union territories. As a pre-emptive measure, Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was imposed in the state and prominent state political leaders such as former chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti were placed under house arrest. Communication lines, too, were snapped while internet and mobile services were suspended.Tarigami, who met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi along with 13 other leaders from the Union territory on June 24, said the nullification of Article 35 A made the status of permanent residents redundant. “Protection of jobs and the land rights was removed arbitrarily which deepened the alienation and sense of insecurity in all regions. The economy of J&K has virtually collapsed as tourism, trade agriculture, horticulture and handicraft sectors were badly hit. Employment opportunities are shrinking. Is corruption any less and governance any better? The fact remains that not a single claim stands the test of scrutiny,” he said in the statement. The four-time legislator and general secretary of CPI(M) added that continuous restrictions on the movement of people and attempts to gag the media had resulted in a forced silence. “Over the last two years, it has become amply clear why the Centre was so insistent on taking such drastic, unlawful measures... Suppression of civil and democratic rights continues, indiscriminate arrests...and issuing of diktats like not to provide clearance for passport and government services if anyone is involved in ‘law and order, and stone pelting cases’ is one more addition,” he said.Tarigami was referring to a recent order of the state Criminal Investigation Department (CID) denying security clearance for passport and other government services to all those involved in “law and order and stone pelting cases”. “The Centre would realise the futility of the decisions taken on August 5, 2019 and our struggle in defence of our rights...through peaceful and legal means will continue,” he added.Reacting to the PAGD statement, BJP spokesperson Altaf Thakur said there’s no place for anti-national elements or those spreading terrorism in “Naya Kashmir”. “In the last two years, the main focus of the government has been to empower people at the grassroots level which was done by holding elections of block development councils and the district development councils and providing them with funds. Apart from development, there has been action against anti-national elements. This is our vision for Naya Kashmir,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2nd-anniversary-of-abrogation-of-art-370-pagd-slams-bjp-s-naya-kashmir-slogan-101628077842375.html
05-08-2021||India||Centre builds 200k tonne onion buffer to guard against inflation||The Union government has built a record reserve of 200,000 tonne of onions to deal with potential spikes in onion prices during the coming lean season. Such seasonal price spirals could impact the wider economy and households alike, an official familiar with the matter said.Onion prices had doubled in October 2020, a result of unseasonal rainfall during March and April that year, shriveling crops. Retail prices first rose to about ₹70 per kg in cities such as Mumbai and Delhi from usual rates of between ₹35 and ₹40, and then spiralled to ₹100 per kg. In Delhi, the average retail price for a common variety of onion over the past week has been ₹40, indicating normal supplies.Prices of some food items, where seasonality plays a big role, tend to be volatile. Onion is one of them. Its rates often stoke food inflation and knock the monthly budgets of consumers, poor or rich, because the vegetable is a base ingredient of most Indian dishes.Past data shows onion prices usually tend to rise during September because the month marks the beginning of a nearly three-month lean season, when stocks from previous crops deplete. Fresh harvests usually arrive in markets in the winter.Retail prices, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, rose 6.25% in June, slightly lower than a 6.3% rise in May, but driven by higher food and fuel costs, latest official data show. The retail inflation rate is above the Reserve Bank’s target of 4% (+/-2). Inflation in the food and beverages category stood at 5.58%, compared to 5.24% in May.Price rise is a key determinant of monetary policies. Moderate inflation helps the Reserve Bank to keep interest rates low to spur economic activity, which has been hit by the pandemic. The next meeting of the monetary policy committee or MPC of RBI is on Friday, August 6.“The buffer size (of onions) has been enhanced from 5,137MT in 2017-18 to 100,000MT in 2020-21, which has been further enhanced to 200,000 MT in 2021-22 to ensure a more effective intervention to control prices,” a government document reviewed by HT said.The official cited above said that the government is “monitoring prices of all essential commodities as always”. If prices rise, the government hopes to step in by releasing onions “as and when needed” from its own reserves to keep rates stable, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-builds-record-onion-buffer-to-guard-against-inflation-101628073101822.html
