06-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Four held with 12 kg heroin worth ₹48 crore||New Delhi: Delhi police on Friday said they seized 12 kilograms of heroin allegedly from four members of an interstate drug syndicate who were arrested in two back-to-back operations carried out on Thursday in west and north Delhi. Police said two of the arrested drug peddlers are from Manipur, while the others are from Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly and Delhi’s Rajapuri.“Their interrogation has once again highlighted the fact that the Golden Triangle -- Lhasa, Thailand and Myanmar -- is emerging as a major suppliers. This route is being used to pump heroin into northeastern states of India from Afghanistan. From there, the heroin is smuggled to Bareilly and further trafficked to Delhi-NCR,” said deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav.DCP Yadav said that the special cell sleuths were working on interstate gangs that were using these routes to supply heroin to north India, especially Delhi-NCR. It was learnt that the key suppliers based in Manipur also collected raw materials from two sources – hilly areas along the international border of Manipur and Myanmar, and militancy-affected areas of Manipur such as Saikul and Thobal, where opium is illegally cultivated. Thereafter, the raw materials are processed into pure heroin and transported to Barielly, from where they are moved to other parts of the country, he said.“One such syndicate was led by Mohammad Abdul Razzak from Manipur. We identified some members of his syndicate and mounted surveillance on their activities,” said Yadav.Around 9am on Thursday, the DCP said the team arrested Razzak’s associate, Shahnawaz Hussain, from Manipur and his Delhi counterpart Sachin from Rajapuri, and allegedly recovered 10 kilograms of heroin from them. Their interrogation led to the arrest of Razzak and Mohammad Idrish, a resident of Bareilly, from near Kotwali, where they had come to deliver heroin to their contact. The two allegedly had one kilo of heroin each.“A total of 12 kilograms of heroin worth ₹48 crore in the international market were seized from the arrested men,” said DCP Yadav.Police said Razzak’s interrogation revealed that he had established links with drug suppliers in Myanmar, illegal producers of opium in Manipur and drug peddlers active in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. He allegedly received big consignments of crude heroin from Myanmar through porous borders, processed it into fine quality contraband and supplied them to drug peddlers in UP and Delhi. “Razzak used to travel to UP and Delhi via air to meet his clients. Thereafter, he sent the consignments of heroin from Manipur through carriers. His carriers travel in private cars, trucks and even in public transports like buses and trains. He used to receive money for the drugs through hawala channels,” added the DCP. Police said Hussain, who was a truck driver who allegedly used to carry the drugs, had made a secret cavity beneath the footrest of his truck to hide packets of heroin inside. Idrish and Sachin allegedly received the consignments from Razzak in UP and Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhifour-held-with-12-kg-heroin-worth-48-crore-101628274540946.html

06-08-2021||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath says social media uncontrolled, being misused by opponents||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said the social media was being misused by opponents to create social tension, caste conflict and lawlessness in the country and the state.Alleging that negative propaganda was being spread against the BJP government on social media platforms by rivals, he said party workers should counter it effectively by highlighting the achievements of the central and state governments. Yogi Adityanath was speaking at a workshop of the BJP’s IT and social media cell at Indira Gandhi Pratishthan in Lucknow.“After 2014, when Narendra Modi became Prime Minister, trivial issues are being hyped by opponents on social media platforms. When the central government goes before the people with its major achievement or announcements, it is deliberately targeted,” he said.“Efforts are made to vitiate the atmosphere of the country through the social media when people are to witness a major event launched by the BJP government. A conspiracy is hatched to divert the attention of the people from the main issues,” he said.Terming social media an uncontrolled system, Yogi said it has no “mai baap” (master).“If you are not alert or prepared, you will become the victim of media trial. One cannot disengage from the activities on the social media, it has made an impact on the youths and system. The issues raised on social media platforms are followed by the print and visual media,” he said.When the Monsoon session of Parliament was to commence, the Pegasus issue was raised by some media groups to disrupt the session, he said.“Those who raised the issue have no evidence, but it is being carried in print, visual and social media. The Monsoon session is important. It is being held when the country is fighting the Covid pandemic. Discussion should have been held on the Covid management by the government, internal and external security,” he added.Before the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Rafale issue was raised on social media platforms, Yogi Adityanath said.“We countered it and the people rejected the rivals’ campaign on the social media,” the chief minister said.Observing that the party’s social media warriors had an important role to play in countering the opponents’ misinformation campaign, he said the BJP’s effort in bringing Kashmir into the national mainstream, ending terrorism and a peaceful solution to the Ram temple issue should be highlighted.“We should not delay or wait for the appropriate moment, but move into action mode immediately. The parties that have no organisation or presence in UP are trying to emerge as opinion makers by increasing their activities on the social media. We should not remain mute spectators,” he said.“If we do not counter the rivals’ campaign by highlighting the facts, they will try to take advantage of it as our weakness. When an incident happens in UP, the trial of the state government starts on the social media. People residing in Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Bengaluru as well as in the UAE, the UK and the USA start giving their opinion on the issue,” he said.He also said an analysis had revealed that 90% of the tweets were by people who had no connection with UP.They have no interest in the development of the state or welfare of people of UP, he said.Deputy chief ministers Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Prasad Maurya and BJP state unit president Swatantra Dev Singh also expressed their views on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-says-social-media-uncontrolled-being-misused-by-opponents-101628274241442.html

06-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai local trains for all: Aaditya Thackeray hints at relaxations in 2-3 days||As Bharatiya Janata Party leaders held rasta-roko and rail-bharo protests in various parts of Mumbai demanding that general public be allowed to use local train services, state minister Aaditya Thackeray hinted that the state could allow fully vaccinated people to use local trains soon. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in a meeting with representatives of hotel and restaurant owners’ associations, however, said there will be no immediate increase in business hours for eateries and the state would review the situation in areas where relaxations were provided earlier this week, and in districts where the situation is still serious before allowing more operational hours for eateries. The demand to open up local trains in Mumbai has been growing from all quarters, along with demand for more business hours for eateries/restaurants in Mumbai and other areas, additional operational hours to shops and establishments in districts where Covid activity is still high. The state government on August 2 announced relaxations in 25 districts, but kept 11 districts under level three curbs as the weekly positivity and growth rates were higher than the state’s overall averages. In Mumbai, the eateries are allowed to operate till 4pm.Maharashtra, meanwhile, reported 5,539 new Covid-19 infections in the past 24 hours. The state recorded under-6000 cases after a gap of four days. Maharashtra added 187 fresh fatalities, taking the toll to 133,717. The active cases in the state stood at 74,483. In the past 24 hours, the state tested 210,425 samples and had a positivity rate of 2.63%. Mumbai, meanwhile, added 307 fresh cases. The active cases in the city stood at 5,147. Mumbai reported eight deaths, pushing the death toll to 15,937.Reacting to opposition’s protests, Aaditya, who heads the environment and tourism departments, said they “should act responsibly” as the state has to apply caution and make decision as per the situation. “I think one should act in a responsible manner. In other countries where vaccination has been done [to a large extent], like in the US, UK, the cases are rising again. We are concerned about people’s lives. About [restarting] railways, we have been holding deliberations for past few weeks. In the next two-three days, you will know what relaxations can be given for double vaccinated population, not just on trains, but in other activities as well. We are carefully discussing these issues and you will know about it soon,” Aaditya said on Friday.Aaditya further said that the main aim of the state government was to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 infection in Maharashtra. “It is important that we apply caution and not come to a state where hospitals have to be filled up again. With this aim, we have to look at the situation and work... We have increased hospitals, medical facilities and oxygen supply as well but it should be our first responsibility that people don’t get the infection,” he said.People close to chief minister Thackeray said that he could address the state on Sunday to apprise people about government’s decision on further relaxations and to pacify the traders and small business owners. Senior state officials said the government is tilted toward allowing only people who have taken both the jabs as opening up trains for all in February brought in the second wave of Covid-19 infections in the state earlier than expected. The chief minister was wary of reopening local trains but after the Bombay High Court has asked the state to consider allowing fully vaccinated people, the decision-making is gaining pace, senior state officials said. “The recommendation that has gone from the two departments [health and relief and rehabilitation] is to allow only fully vaccinated persons. Trains currently carry about 700,000 passengers daily and we cannot allow everybody to travel as it would increase the risk. If one recalls, the second wave came earlier as trains were opened for all from February. Only double vaccinated people should be allowed. The availability of vaccines is much better now, unlike in June. This decision will give push to people to get vaccinated,” the senior official said requesting anonymity, he added that the CM will make a decision in a couple of days.Another senior official said the state government will hold discussions with railway officials on the move. “We are considering common cards identifying people as fully vaccinated, but the checking will have to done by the railways. As they carry out random checking of passengers for tickets and season passes, they can do it for this as well. There is no foolproof manner to check everybody unfortunately,” the second official said.Thackeray in a the meeting with hotel and restaurant associations said that they have to move ahead with caution as they state wants to keep the possible third wave of Covid infections as low as possible. Representatives from Indian Hotels and Restaurant Association (Ahar), Hotel Owners’ Association, National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI) and others met Thackeray at Varsha bungalow, CM’s official residence to demand increase in timings for eateries.A statement from the chief minister’s office quoted Thackeray, “We want to restart everything as it was pre-Covid. Right now, we have provided some relaxation in curbs in the first phase. In that, we have given more relaxation to open areas or outdoor activities. We have to take cautious steps about indoor activities. There was a huge demand of oxygen supply in the second wave, the Centre has already said that the third wave could require more oxygen. We will review situation, including rate of infections and active cases, in areas where relaxations were given.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-local-trains-for-all-aaditya-thackeray-hints-at-relaxations-in-2-3-days-101628273762039.html
06-08-2021||Ranchi||BJP amps up attack on Hemant Soren govt over employment policy||RANCHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday escalated its attacks on Jharkhand’s Hemant Soren government over its new employment policy, insisting that it will hurt the interests of Hindi speaking population and those belonging to the unreserved category in the state.The Hemant Soren cabinet on Thursday cleared decided to amend the eligibility criteria and syllabus for the recruitment examination conducted by the Jharkhand Staff Selection Commmission (JSSC) for subordinate staff in grade 3 and 4.The new policy, which replaces the two-stage JSSC examination with a single examination, mandates that candidates who do not belong to the notified reserved categories should have appeared in the Class 10 and 12 examinations from a school in Jharkhand to be eligible.The new examination pattern also requires candidates to clear a language paper from a list of 12 including tribal languages besides Bangla, Odiya and Urdu. Marks in the regional language paper will be counted to calculate a candidate’s marks; Hindi and English paper would be qualifying papers.Pratul Shahdeo of the BJP said the new policy discriminates against Hindi and people from the Hindi heartland and seeks to appease the minority community and his party will take all steps to block its implementation.“Earlier, subjects like Hindi, Sanskrit and Urdu were also in the list of main language papers. But the new policy has kept Urdu but dropped Hindi and Sanskrit. How is Urdu a regional language but Hindi is not? It smacks of appeasement. By the new policy, the government is discriminating against people living in certain regions of the state,” Shahdeo told reporters at the state unit’s headquarters in state capital Ranchi. “In districts like Palamu and Garhwa many people speak Bhojpuri. Similarly, majority of people in Godda and Sahebganj districts speak Angika. While these languages have not been listed in the regional language, Hindi could have been a common link. But residents of these districts will not be able to appear for these posts,” he added.The provision requiring candidates to have completed Class10 and 12 from the state, the BJP leader said it discriminates against general category students who are natives of Jharkhand. “There are many people whose children may have studied outside the state, but they are original inhabitants (of Jharkhand). Why discriminate against them,” Shahdeo added.Hemant Soren’s Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, however, denied the charges saying the new policy was in the interest of locals including the tribals, dalit, backward classes and the original inhabitants of the state. “There should be no confusion on this,” JMM principal general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya.“Till now there were too many loopholes in the employment policy, which were used by people to challenge it in court. On the language front, instead of appeasement we are assimilating all sections of the society. Urdu was in fact declared second state language by the previous BJP goverment. As far as regional languages are concerned, its importance lies in the fact that they act as a catalyst in governance as common people who interact with grade 3 and 4 category employees are able to express their problems in a better way in their mother tongue,” said Bhattacharya. Domicile has been a controversial issue in Jharkhand’s employment policy ever since the tribal-dominated state was carved out of Bihar in 2000. Bringing an end to the uncertainties over the issue, the previous BJP government led by Raghubar Das fixed 1985 as the base year to decide on the domicile of any resident.The issue continues to be a controversial one and became a major talking point in the 2019 assembly elections when the BJP lost power, with other political parties, especially the JMM and Congress taking a contrary stand and promising to change it.The employment policy notified by the Raghubar Das government also ran into legal trouble after the high court struck down the provision to reserve jobs in 11 scheduled districts to residents of the respective districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/bjp-amps-up-attack-on-hemant-soren-govt-over-employment-policy-101628273760427.html

Another report was prepared by the then assistant director, enforcement directorate, Niranjan Singh; the third report/opinion is that of a committee that the then additional chief secretary (home) headed. All are lying sealed before the high court since 2018.Advocate Navkiran Singh, who was an intervener in a 2013 petition in the Jagdish Bhola drug racket case, has filed the plea. In 2013, a suo motu petition was allowed into the alleged ₹6,000 crore drug racket case and the court is monitoring probe that various agencies are conducting.Jagdish Bhola, a former deputy superintendent of police (DSP) with the Punjab Police, is the alleged mastermind of this international racket and has been convicted in at least three FIRs by a trial court. The Bhola drugs racket case has not been taken up since March 20, 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.In its report, the STF had taken into account a note on the ED probe into the racket, especially on the involvement of some high-profile persons. Subsequently, the STF report was also shared with Niranjan Singh and Punjab government, following which they too had submitted their reports.The plea of Navkiran says that reports need to be opened and specific orders need to be passed as since 2018 no substantial order has been passed.“The matter relates to drug mafia operating in Punjab which has international tentacles and needs to be dealt on an urgent basis, since it affects the life of Punjabi youth,” the petition says.Another application filed by Navkiran pleads that a status report from Centre be sought on pending requests for extradition of 13 of the fugitives involved in drug mafia, hiding abroad. Details of these persons were forward by the Punjab Police to the Centre in 2018. Both governments have to respond by November 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bhola-drug-racket-hc-seeks-response-from-punjab-centre-on-plea-for-making-probe-reports-public-101628273341598.html

Last month, ED had raided Deshmukh’s ancestral houses at Wadvihira and Katol in Nagpur district in connection with the alleged ₹100-crore extortion case. ED also raided his Nagpur residence at Civil Lines in June. Former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh had alleged that as the Maharashtra home minister, Deshmukh had asked suspended police officer Sachin Vaze – arrested in the Antilia explosives scare and Mansukh Hiran murder case – and other cops to extort ₹100 crore every month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. Following the allegations, the Bombay high court ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary inquiry. The agency registered a first information report (FIR) against Deshmukh in April, after which he stepped down as the minister “on moral grounds”. The ED, which was also invited to join the probe, arrested Deshmukh’s personal assistant Kundan Shinde and personal secretary Sanjeev Palande in June. Shinde is also one of the trustees of Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha, along with other members of the Deshmukh family. The trust runs engineering, MBA and polytechnic colleges at Fetri. Upon scrutinising the trust’s bank statements, ED said there are a number of cheque entries in the recent past amounting to approximately ₹4.18 crore, which was received from various Delhi-based companies. It is found that they are paper (bogus) companies and only work for providing transfer entries. ED has stated that it is apparent that Deshmukh, by virtue of his earlier position as Maharashtra home minister, received amounts to the tune of approximately ₹4.70 crore from owners and managers of bars for their “smooth functioning” and the bribe money was apparently used by him through his son Hrishikesh for providing cash to Delhi-based paper companies. After layering the money, it was routed to the trust in the form of donations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/corruption-probe-ed-raids-anil-deshmukh-controlled-college-in-nagpur-101628272201805.html
06-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: BJP protests at train stations, seeks local trains for all||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) held protests at various railway stations and key junctions in Mumbai and Thane on Friday, demanding permission for the general public to commute in local trains. Party leaders staged rasta rook and travelled by train without ticket as part of the protest. A few leaders were fined by the railway authorities while police detained party workers and leaders from blocking roads.Led by state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil, party leaders held protests at Churchagate, Andheri, Sion, Kandivli and Thane. Leader of Opposition Pravin Darekar, who travelled from Churchgate to Charni Road without ticket along with party workers, was fined for travelling without valid permission and ticket. Party legislators Atul Bhatkhalkar, Rahul Narvekar and others were detained by police at Churchagate, Kandivli and others places.“The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has been adamant over giving permission to the general public, who have been facing hardships, to travel by local trains. They have not been able to attend office as travelling in buses and taxis is inconvenient and financially unviable,” Patil said. Party leader Prasad Lad said, “Many citizens in Mumbai have been spending up to ₹15,000 a month for travelling in taxis in the absence of local trains. We will intensify the protest if government does not open locals for all immediately.”In Thane, party workers started protest at the railway platform and moved to trains despite heavy police bandobast. “It takes almost four hours for those staying in Badlapur-Kasara and Vasai-Virar areas to reach Mumbai. They are suffering a lot and have to bear the financial burden of traveling by road to their work places daily. Not everyone can work from home. Instead of understanding these situations, the government has tried all means to stop us from protesting,” said Niranjan Davkhare, MLC from Thane.“Protestors had gathered outside the railways station. Police had formed a human chain for security, but as soon as the train arrived on platform number 1, protesters barged in. While some tried to get into the train, others were stopped,” said a government railway police (GRP) officer on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-bjp-protests-at-train-stations-seeks-local-trains-for-all-101628272081266.html

Raut and others filed moved HC challenging the order on the grounds that they were not given an opportunity to oppose the transfer. Raut’s application stated that MCP was already overcrowded and as it is far from Taloja jail, he would not able to get medicines which are provided to him by his family who live in Navi Mumbai. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar was informed by advocate Vijay Hiremath that the transfer was ordered at the behest of the superintendent of Taloja jail and passed without following due procedure. The petition stated that as per prison and NIA rules, the judge had to ensure that proper procedure for transferring an undertrial prisoner was followed in the form of issuing a notice to the prisoner, giving him a chance to have his say, and then deciding on whether to transfer the prisoner. It added that the judge did not follow any of the procedures, hence his order should be set aside. It further stated that Raut is from Chandrapur and has several health problems for which his sister and brother-in-law, who stay close to Taloja jail, provide him with medicines and other items of necessity which are permitted inside the jail. In view of this, the petition said that if he was shifted to MCP, it would become difficult for his sister to provide the necessary medicines. After hearing Hiremath and perusing the petition, the bench asked, “You have been filing various applications about difficulties in Taloja jail, but now you want to stay there.” As the state and NIA informed the court that they had not received copies of the petition, the court asked Hiremath to provide them with the same and posted hearing to August 11. Hiremath and advocate R Satyanarayanan insisted that some temporary relief be granted till the next date of hearing, the bench refused to pass any orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/first-you-complained-about-taloja-jail-now-you-want-to-stay-hc-to-elgar-parishad-accused-101628271840512.html
06-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: BJP’s Chandrakant Patil meets MNS chief Raj Thackeray||Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Chandrakant Patil called on Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray at the latter’s residence in Dadar on Friday morning, fuelling speculations over a BJP-MNS tie up in the civic polls slated to be held early next year. The meeting is seen as the first step towards an alliance between the two parties.After the Shiv Sena snapped ties with the BJP in October 2019 to form the government in Maharashtra with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, the saffron party was left with no major alliance partner. The BJP is in the search of a partner for the local body elections when 22 municipal corporations, 24 district councils and dozens of other local bodies will have elections. The MNS enjoys sizable pockets in cities like Mumbai, Nashik, Kalyan-Dombivli and could help the BJP in garnering votes of Marathi speaking population and denting the vote bank of friend-turned-foe Sena which effectively plays the Marathi manoos card to get votes of Maharashtrians in metropolitan areas of the state. The MNS uses the same sons of the soil plank for elections. The BJP has time and again clarified that it cannot join hands with the MNS unless the latter shreds its regional and linguistic chauvinism and hatred towards outsiders. Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis last week said, “We cannot think of an alliance with the MNS unless it adopts inclusive Hindutva and changes its stand towards north Indians. We welcome the MNS’s Hindutva stand of late, but it should be an inclusive Hindutva.”Patil, after meeting Thackeray on Friday, said there was neither a discussion over an alliance nor was there any proposal for it. He said he had a conversation with Thackeray on the issue of migrants and was convinced that the MNS chief does not hate migrants. “It was a courtesy visit after he invited me for tea when we happened to meet each other during our separate tours last week in Nashik. When he casually asked about our stand on alliance with the MNS, I had clarified to him about the perception outsiders have in their minds about him. He sent me a clip of his speech delivery before the gathering of north Indians. I have, after hearing it, no doubt in mind that his stand, being a regional leader, is right. If he says that locals should get 80% of jobs and it should be the policy in any given state, there should not be any problem with it. The only thing he needs to change is the perception, as his stand appears as hatred towards them,” he said.Patil’s meeting assumes significance as it was held a day ahead of meetings with party’s central leadership in Delhi. Patil is expected to discuss the issue with BJP president JP Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah.On the other hand, the MNS too was reportedly positive about an alliance with the BJP for the forthcoming elections. Party leaders have conveyed to the BJP that the MNS no longer attacks north Indians. Senior MNS leader Bala Nandgaonkar said, “Anything can happen in politics. We need to be positive. Raj saheb has not of late criticised North Indians. We have conveyed it to BJP leaders by sending a clip of our party chief’s speech. There is no misconception (about our stand) among the people. Our leader will clarify it at the appropriate time.”MNS workers have been pressuring their top brass to tie up with the BJP. With the Sena in power in the state and Mumbai civic body, MNS workers are feeling the heat. “We will not be in a position to win beyond 10 seats on our own in the forthcoming Mumbai civic polls. Workers are impatient and need influence and power, which only can be achieved with the tie-up,” said a senior MNS leader who refused to come on record. Many feel the BJP needs the MNS more than the other way round. “Many BJP candidates lost in 2017 Mumbai civic polls by a few hundred votes, and this is where the MNS vote bank can come in handy for them,” said another MNS functionary.The BJP, too, is positive about joining hands with MNS. “Especially after it has been clear that re-alliance between Sena and BJP is impossible, we desperately need an alliance partner. Alliance with the MNS will help us strengthen our roots in Marathi pockets and also dent the Sena, which is our enemy number 1 in Maharashtra. But before forging an alliance with the MNS, we want to send a clear message that we are not compromising on the interest of north Indians who are our core vote bank. Our party leadership wants to make Raj Thackeray to come clear on it,” said a BJP leader.Thackeray had become a bitter critic of the BJP prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and held several rallies in the state criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government, on issues such as economy, foreign and domestic policies, and welfare schemes for farmers. He had also been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with transactions related to the purchase of Kohinoor Mills land at Dadar in central Mumbai. However, recently, he has refrained from criticising Modi and turned his ire on his cousin and Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.In January 2020, he unveiled his party’s new flag which is saffron-coloured, symbolising his party’s drift towards the Hindutva ideology. The MNS has lost political ground over the years. The party had 13 MLAs in the 2009-2014 Maharashtra Assembly, but won only one Assembly seat each in 2014 and 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-bjp-s-chandrakant-patil-meets-mns-chief-raj-thackeray-101628271660290.html

For residents of Prayagraj, especially those residing in Jhunsi area of the city, it is an equally special moment as one of the key members of the winning team has had a very long and strong connection with Sangam city. Assistant coach of the team, Piyush Dubey did his MA in Economics from Allahabad University and after getting diploma from NIS-Patiala, even coached students of Kendriya Vidyalaya, AFS-Manauri besides working as guest lecturer at department of Physical Education, AU.Speaking from Tokyo, Dubey shared many moments that shaped his career and which he would always cherish. “I was quite young when I started working at KV Manauri as a guest coach for training the hockey team of the school in 2004. Hearing that a new coach has come, around 130 students, both boys and girls, came on the field and I suddenly faced the challenge of having to select a final team from so many hopefuls. Although my first salary was around ₹2800 per month at a time when my personal expenses were around ₹15000, but the experience of teaching the basics and the exposure to work independently was far more than any monetary gains,” said Dubey.He then coached AU’s hockey team and later on was again on the grounds of KV Manauri when the then principal Shalini Dikshit selected him to coach the team. School’s team won the nationals in 2004 and 2011. During this period, Dubey did BPEd and MPEd from Barkatullah University, Bhopal. In 2014, Piyush got selected in Sports Authority of India (SAI) and his first appointment was in Sonepat (Haryana). Piyush was also among the selected trainers who were sent by the Government of India to University of Birmingham in England in 2016. There he studied Sports Science and Coaching. More than 75 of his trainees have so far shown their mettle at national and international level tournaments. Piyush’s family is originally from Mathura. His father Kunwar Garvendra Singh Dubey was a wrestler. He got the title of ‘Singh’ only because of his wrestling. “It so happened that my elder brother Shravan was also fond of wrestling and I used to go to the akhara at Jhunsi with him. On the way, a small ground was there where noted coach Prem Shankar Shukla used to teach hockey to kids. One day he handed me the stick and asked me to try my hands. He was very impressed to see my dribbling skills at an early age and asked me to concentrate on hockey only,” shared Dubey over phone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tokyo-olympics-propels-up-s-hockey-star-into-limelight-101628271060091.html

In the letter, Mohol has made the case for relief from level 3 restrictions in Pune, pointing to the decreasing positivity rate in the city. He also mentioned that the 4pm deadline under level 3 is proving to be inconvenient to all and hence, the state government should ease some curbs in the city. “On behalf of Pune citizens and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), I am demanding relief from restrictions. I have been demanding the same at the Covid review meeting chaired by guardian minister Ajit Pawar every week. He had expressed positivity, but in reality, Pune didn’t get relaxations,” said Mohol in the letter. He also claimed that the declining positivity rate in Pune indicated that the Covid situation in Pune is under control. “From the second week of July, positivity rate in Pune has dropped to 3.22% from 5%. For the last 16 months, all Punekars have been following the orders of the state government. Now I request you to provide some relief to Pune,” said Mohol. Earlier, Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao had claimed that the administration would recommend relaxations in PMC and PCMC at the weekly Covid review meeting. The meeting, which was to be held on Saturday, has now been postponed to Sunday. City units of congress and NCP have also taken a pro relaxation stand. The city chiefs of both parties have expressed the view that relaxations can be given in PMC limits as the Covid caseload in the city has decreased. Pune city Congress chief Ramesh Bagwe said that there is no harm in easing some curbs where Covid numbers have reduced. “The matter is not only of traders. It’s about the small business operators who rely on the market economy of the city. We are of the opinion that strict restrictions should be in place where Covid cases are still high. But, like in Pune city, where cases have gone down, timings of shops should be extended. I would request the guardian minister to consider this factor,” said Ramesh Bagwe, president, Pune city-district Congress committee. Earlier, NCP city chief Prashant Jagtap had also backed demands of relief from Covid-induced curbs in Pune. “The daily caseload in Pune city has decreased. As NCP workers we would surely request the guardian minister to give some relaxations to Pune city. The collective Covid numbers in the district are high, but Pune city has been recording fewer numbers. In Mumbai, there is no rural area. Because of the rural parts, collective numbers of Pune districts are higher,” said Jagtap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mayor-writes-to-tope-asking-for-relaxation-of-covid-curbs-in-pune-101628270880167.html

August will now also see a huge demand from those aged 18-plus for their second dose of Covishield. On Thursday and Friday, PMC shut down its centres for Covishield and before that, for four days, from Saturday to Tuesday, Covishield vaccination sites were shut due to a shortage of supply. Dr Suryakant Deokar, immunisation officer, PMC, said, “We are yet to get any Covishield vaccine doses as of Friday evening and even if we get the doses on Saturday, we cannot start the vaccination drive on Sunday, because we have the usual OPDs. On Sunday the Covid-19 immunisation team gets a break. However, if the vaccines come on Saturday or Sunday then we would be able to start the Covishield vaccination drive on Monday. so for over four days we would have not had any Covishield vaccination at the PMC centres. Last week too we could not arrange any Covishield through PMC because we did not have vaccine doses.”This comes two days after state health minister Rajesh Tope announced that districts which report a higher positivity rate will get more vaccines. Such districts which have a higher positivity rate include Pune, Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara. However, the shortage of vaccines continues in Pune. While government centres are falling short of vaccine doses, private hospitals got 10,000 doses of covishield on Friday, for the second consecutive day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccine-shortage-no-covishield-at-pmc-centres-until-monday-101628270879601.html

As per the study, from 36 districts in Maharashtra, 11 were found highly vulnerable to extreme weather events, droughts and dwindling water security. These districts account for 40% of the farmland across Central Maharashtra. Similarly, 37% of the state’s agricultural area, spread over 14 other districts, is moderately vulnerable, which takes the total tally to three-fourths of Maharashtra’s farmland being impacted by what the report cites as climate change.The study, entitled, ‘Socio-economic vulnerability to climate change – Index development and mapping for districts in Maharashtra’, revealed that extreme climate conditions affect the livelihoods and agrarian economy of Maharashtra. The study was conducted by Chaitanya Adhav at Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR )- National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal, Haryana, under the guidance of Dr R Sendhil from ICAR-Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research. The study claims that Nandurbar is the most vulnerable district to cyclones, floods, droughts, changing rainfall patterns and extreme temperatures, all affecting crop production. The other highly vulnerable 10 districts include Buldhana, Beed, Jalna, Aurangabad, Hingoli, Parbhani, Nanded, Akola, Amravati, and Washim.The 14 districts listed as moderately vulnerable, includes Dhule, Jalgaon, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Sangli, Solapur, Osmanabad, Latur, Yavatmal, Wardha, Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gondia and Gadchiroli. The dominant crops from these districts that will bear the brunt of the climate changes are jowar, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton, ragi, cashew nut, barley, and millets.Explaining it further Adhav said their findings showed that most of the highly vulnerable districts fell under the Central Maharashtra Plateau Zone, which makes up a 22.22 percent share of the total farmed area in Maharashtra. The Central Vidarbha Zone has an additional share of 6.78 percent area as highly vulnerable.The authors explained that to quantify the climate change-induced risk, a socio-economic vulnerability index (SEVI) was calculated using key climatic parameters, such as exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of districts to climate vulnerability.“Mapping of districts shows that there is an instant need for focused policy efforts to address the socio-economic vulnerability in Central Maharashtra Plateau Zone, Scarcity Zone (Dhule, parts of Nandurbar and Aurangabad), and Eastern Vidarbha Zone,” Adhav said.Vijay Anna Borade, agriculture expert & trustee of the Marathwada Sheti Sahayak Mandal (MSSM) said, “While there is a lot of discussion about impact of climate change on agriculture, there is very little on-ground action. What we are witnessing now is concerning, because on one hand the number of rainy days in a year have reduced drastically, while on other hand areas Marathwada, which usually receives very little rainfall, is now being flooded. Keeping in mind the vulnerability of districts, changing crop patterns is a solution, but it’s not going to be such an easy task. Another option is controlled farming which also has financial limitations. Thus, we need a viable and sustainable plan to enable Maharashtra to tackle the impacts of climate change on farming.”Nine districts including Palghar, Thane, Raigad, Nashik, Satara, Kolhapur, Ahmednagar, Nagpur and Pune were found to be least vulnerable to agricultural distress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/11-districts-in-maha-highly-vulnerable-to-extreme-weather-events-study-101628270819585.html

According to SCAI (Shopping Centres Association Of India) Covid restrictions have resulted into losses of Rs15,000 crore for the industry. Nearly 80 per cent of employees working at retail stores and restaurants belong to an economically weaker section and their livelihood is impacted the most. Most of the employees working in this sector are from other states.“Many employees are jobless without any alternative income source. Without alternative income sources, these staffers and their families will have no means to survive. If the Covid restrictions continue, joblessness is expected to be significantly worse. They are looking up to the mall owners, unfortunately we are helpless. In the current scenario it’s the need of the hour to protect the most vulnerable before it becomes very urgent,” said Surjit Singh Rajpurohit, committee member SCAI and COO, Amanora Mall.

Indian Army has stood tall and strong in the phase of this pandemic. However, I have always maintained that wars are not between armies, but waged between nations and it requires a national effort. While hard power in our context will always be relevant, equally important is the leveraging of soft power,” he said.The army chief was speaking at the golden jubilee celebrations of TV wing of Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) in Pune.The army chief also said that war movies have always had an endearing impact on people of all ages, especially youth. “These films have immortalised our soldiers in the hearts of every Indian. We have grown up watching these films which have captured the valour and travails of the armed forces. These movies still serve to reinforce the spirit of the supreme sacrifice of soldiers in the nation’s conscience,” he said. Acknowledging the role of the entertainment industry, the army chief pointed out that he found the stereotyping of the Indian officers in films as both amusing and intriguing. He gave the example of a “khadus colonel”, with a shotgun in one hand and a glass of whisky in the other. “Creative licence is understood, but I believe that stereotyping of communities and characters best be avoided,” he said.Travelling down the memory lane, General Naravane said that his visits to Pune are always nostalgic. “My grandfather’s house was on Prabhat road and my maternal grandfather’s house was at Karve road. We used to go from one house to another on foot when we visited Pune the during summer holidays. Travelling on foot is one of the reasons that I was sent to the infantry. While I came visiting the grandparents, I used to go from outside to the FTII, but today I have come to the campus for the first time and feel proud to see the sprawling campus,” he said. Also present on the occasion were noted filmmakers Sai Paranjpe and Jabbar Patel, along with the director Bhupendra Kainthola.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/exigencies-on-active-borders-have-only-increased-in-pandemic-army-chief-101628270761693.html

Coming down heavily on this illegal ticketing touts, the Railway Protection Force (RPF) of the Pune railway division has started procuring advance software to “hack this racket”. RPF claims to have found “footprints from Pakistan” among touts involved in illegal ticket bookings, especially at the Pune, Mumbai and Bihar railway stations.“Applicant needs to book a railway ticket from the IRCTC website, and for each mobile number only one person can login. Also, as per the central government telecom rules, one person can have a maximum of 12 mobile numbers registered on his/her name. Still we have found that these illegal touts book many tickets using advanced software, and all from one mobile number. Our cyber cell of RPF Pune division is constantly monitoring their activities and their footprints have been traced to Pakistan. Most of these hackers and touts are found to be from other countries. They mostly reserve tickets in bulk for trains running from Mumbai, Pune and Bihar railway stations,” said RPF Pune divisional security commissioner Uday Singh Pawar.The Pune RPF division has the country’s first cyber cell under the Indian Railway, which was formed in July 2019, and its operations were kept secret initially for some important investigations. Railway decided to start cyber cells in six different cities. There are various cyber-related investigations undertaken by this cell, which include keeping a watch on illegal online ticketing, social media and various cyber frauds, A dedicate team of eight work in the including cyber experts. “When we started getting the footprints of Pakistani agents and illegal touts doing online ticketing we started focusing on them. These agents are upgrading their modus operandi and using advance softwares to do illegal ticket reservation, so is the RPF cyber cell is now procuring new software to stay one step ahead. Our main focus is to identify these illegal ticketing activities, find the touts and their modus operandi and crack down their racket,” added Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/advanced-software-and-a-pak-footprint-rpf-to-hack-ticket-touts-in-pune-mumbai-bihar-101628270760249.html

Safety and security at the RTO premises have gone for a toss as the front compound wall, and the entry and exit gate are broken down due to ongoing Metro work. On Thursday, August 5, HT visited the Pune RTO office at Sangamwadi and found the main building housing scrap material and old furniture, hurdles for the public to cross while accessing the counters. “There is such a mess here at the RTO office, furniture and scrap lying in the main building. A ramp has been made for the physically disabled, but the wheelchair is kept in a corner, and is full of dust. It needs to be repaired and kept at the entrance. Also, fire-fighting equipment is not there in case of fire emergency,” said Dattatray Ghule, a citizen who regularly comes to the RTO for work. While there are 10 to 12 tourist buses and heavy vehicles parked inside the RTO premises, the parking space of visitors’ vehicles has been encroached upon. Several scrapped autorickshaws and small vehicles are lying on one side of the office premises. Another citizen Kushal Das who had come to do a vehicle registration (RC) said, “There is one help desk cabin inside the main building, but there is no one there to guide people. The RTO is full of agents and a new person gets confused.”The two-wheeler permanent testing track is used for parking the vehicles, due to which applicants have to go all the way to Vishrantwadi for the test. If this testing track is made functional it can be used for the permanent licence test.

Pay penalty in next electricity bill||PUNE With the Pune circle of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) witnessing the highest number of cheque-bounce cases in the state, the MSEDCL has decided to charge a penalty of Rs885, including Goods Service Tax (GST), to be included in electricity bills of the subsequent month.According to the MSEDCL, out of the nearly 10,500 cheque-bounce cases reported each month, the Pune circle registers the highest (1,750); followed by the Kalyan (1,700); Bhandup (1,500); Nagpur (1,100); and Baramati circles (900). Despite an “online” payment facility being made available, approximately 4500 million consumers pay electricity bills through cheques, as per MSEDCL statistics. Among all the circles in the state, Pune has the highest number of consumers (108,000) paying bills via cheques; followed by Bhandup (104,000); and Kalyan (73,000). In sharp contrast, only 24 to 29,000 consumers from the Nashik, Kolhapur, Baramati and Nagpur circles pay their electricity bills through cheques.Regarding the decision to impose a penalty, Sachin Talewar, chief engineer of MSEDCL’s Pune circle said, “The number of consumers paying their electricity bills through cheques is more in the Pune circle. Therefore, there are more cheque-bounce cases in Pune. Consumers in the low tension (LT) category tend to pay their bills via cheques unlike those in the high tension (HT) category who prefer the RTGS and NEFT modes of payment. Housing societies too pay bills through cheques as they want the documents as records. With some LT consumers intentionally doing this to delay payment of bills, the MSEDCL has decided to charge a penalty of Rs885 including GST as per the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) guidelines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bounced-cheque-pay-penalty-in-next-electricity-bill-101628270699584.html

06-08-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC reserves order on petition challenging CET for FYJC admissions||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday reserved its order on the petition filed by an ICSE board student, Ananya Patki, who challenged the common entrance test (CET) for admission to first-year junior college (FYJC) scheduled to be held on August 21. The counsel for the petitioner argued that as the questions for CET would be based on state board syllabus, it would prejudice students from other boards, hence the CET should be set aside. Counsels for various boards said as the decision to conduct the CET was taken by the state government, they could not interfere. They, however, said the government should have consulted them before announcing the decision. The division bench of justice RD Dhanuka and justice RI Chagla was informed by advocate Yogesh Patki, the petitioners’ father, that the test was discriminatory as it would be based on SSC board syllabus. He also submitted that as the test would be held in the physical format during Covid, it could pose a threat to the students.Patki questioned the need for the test and citing this year Class 10 and 12 exams did not take place. He further said the July 19 notification announcing the CET was issued in a haphazard manner and did not have any clarity. He added that the time to prepare for the exam was insufficient.The government defended its decision to conduct CET in offline mode for FYJC admission and told the court the test was optional and was being conducted to bring parity among students from various boards. It assured the court that as some boards had conducted exams physically in February without getting any reports of students contracting Covid-19, the state would ensure that all Covid protocols were followed during the two-hour test. It also submitted the CET was aimed at safeguarding the rights of all students, hence contentions of the petitioner, who was not representing students from all non-SSC boards, did not hold ground and should be dismissed. While arguing for one of the boards, senior advocate Mihir Desai said the CET was being conducted as SSC exams had not been conducted by most boards, but IGCSE board had conducted the exams physically in February, hence students from that board would be at a disadvantage. He further said the state had, in the past, tried to introduce procedures to bring SSC board students at par with students from other boards while seeking FYJC and with the exception of best of five, all other procedures introduced by the state were struck down by the HC. He added that as the state had not consulted other boards before announcing the CET, other boards were feeling orphaned. While responding to the concerns raised by the petitioner and the boards, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said as the petition had only sought quashing of the exam and not suggested any alternative remedy to the need to bring parity among students from various boards, the petition should be dismissed. He added that the petitioner was a lone student and was not representing all students from various boards, hence the court should not be taking an adverse decision against the conduct of the CET as nearly 1.075 million students from across boards had registered for the CET. He also said the state had introduced Central Admission Programme (CAP) to ensure that merit and choice of students were given preference and hence the CET had to be conducted to decide merit as different boards had evaluated students differently and no standard evaluation process was adopted. “Golden rule is merit-cum-choice... CET is to determine merit and CAP is to determine choice,” said Kumbhakoni. He concluded his argument saying as seats for select colleges were limited like that of medical courses, CET for FYJC admissions was necessary. After hearing all sides, the court reserved its order and will pronounce it on August 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-reserves-order-on-petition-challenging-cet-for-fyjc-admissions-101628270160212.html
06-08-2021||Mumbai||Community awareness, empowering healthcare workers can reduce snakebite deaths, says study||A multi-pronged intervention including community awareness, mapping vulnerable populations, empowering healthcare and paramedical staff could result in bringing down snakebite mortality and morbidity, a new study has shown. The model demonstrated in the qualitative study carried out in the Dahanu block of Palghar district is now set to be replicated in two other blocks in Gadchiroli and Thane. Snakebite is a neglected public health issue, largely affecting the poor. Experts say that there are no accurate estimates of snakebite incidents and deaths in Maharashtra. India has recorded an estimated 1.2 million deaths due to snake bites between 2000 to 2019. In 2013, the researchers of the study had set out to understand the burden of snakebites in the Dahanu block and investigate the problems at the community level, as well as the healthcare level. They found that there was inadequate knowledge about venomous snakes in the community, healthcare workers lacked the confidence to administer the anti-snake venom (ASV) and most patients were referred to higher centres. “The rate of deaths was higher as the patients lost the golden hour of treatment,” said Dr Himmatrao Bawakasar, an expert on snake and scorpion bites and a contributing author of the study published in the PLOS One journal on Thursday. The study was carried out by the National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH) in partnership with the government of Maharashtra. It was funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research’s Tribal Health Research Forum. According to the study, nearly 50% of medical officers in the Dahanu block lacked accurate knowledge about Krait (a species of highly venomous snake) bite symptoms or the renal complications due to the bite of a Russell viper. Nurses and Accredited Social Health Activist (Asha) workers were found to have more knowledge about identifying venomous snake bites and ASV, while a majority of auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) and multi-purpose workers lacked most of this knowledge. In the community, most people preferred herbal medicines and traditional faith healers over a government health facility. “A lot of doctors feared administering the ASV as they were not confident to deal with anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) that may follow after the administering the ASV,” said Bawakasar. The incidence of snakebites in the Dahanu block was 216 per lakh population in 2013. It went up to 264 in 2014 and 338 in 2015. The case fatality rate was around 4.4% (as recorded in 2014). Based on the initial findings, the team of researchers developed an exhaustive model which involved training doctors, Asha workers, anganwadi workers and creating awareness and busting myths among the locals about snake bites. The team conducted 18 focus group discussions for six months in 2017 to initiate discussions about snake bites, prevention and first aid. “Our interventions began in 2016, and by 2017 we were able to bring down the case fatality rate of snakebite to 0.4%,” said Dr Rahul Gajbhiye, principal investigator and corresponding author of the study. “The number of snakebite incidents in 2017 was 304 per lakh population,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/community-awareness-empowering-healthcare-workers-can-reduce-snakebite-deaths-says-study-101628269980352.html
06-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra commission makes way for caste-based census||The Maharashtra State Commission for Backward Classes (MSCBC) has cleared the decks for a Socio Economic and Caste Census in Maharashtra covering the entire population of the state, almost a century after it was last undertaken. Although it is being conducted to collect empirical data and restore political reservations for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in local self-government body elections, activists and observers claim the results may shake up the established socio-political order. The Maharashtra Assembly has approved a resolution seeking a caste-based census. However, the Centre has refused to enumerate caste-wise population other than Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) in the 2021 Census. The MSCBC has now recommended census by the state government. Though Marathas dominate Maharashtra’s politics, the OBCs, who are spread across religion, classes and castes, are considered to be the largest social bloc at over 52% of the population. However, this figure in the BP Mandal Commission report is based on the 1931 data and there is no scientific measurement of their numbers. The National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) has estimated this at a lower 41%. With people voting their caste, accurate data about the OBC population may sharpen their class identity and pit them against dominant sections like the Marathas. The Supreme Court (SC) has scrapped the state’s quota for Marathas in jobs and education, leading to Maratha groups seeking inclusion in the OBC category. This demand is resented by OBCs. In March, the SC struck down the state’s 27% quota for OBCs in local bodies due to lack of empirical data about their backwardness. It said the state government can give these reservations after setting up a backward class commission to conduct an empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of their backwardness. This has created a crisis for the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) regime, with the OBCs getting restive due to the impending loss of political reservations in municipal corporations, councils, zilla parishads and gram panchayats. As such, moves are afoot in the ruling coalition to begin the process to restore political reservation for OBCs. Caste-based census could help the same. Hari Narke, former member of the MSCBC, said in the Indra Sawhney (1992) case, the SC had ruled that an expert commission be set up to identify backward communities. The MSCBC had been established in Maharashtra according to it. “After the Central government refused to part with the 2011 Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC) data, 12 states including BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh have taken a position for a caste census in their states, which will begin soon.... States like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have already completed this survey, while Odisha has launched it,” he explained. MSCBC member and lawyer BL Sagar Killarikar said while this census would be conducted by the state, the commission would decide the format and details to be collected and also analyse these datasets Killarikar said depending on the Covid situation and if the state deputed one enumerator per 100 households, data collection would be completed within three months, after which the commission could begin the analysis. “A caste census will affect the traditional model of Maratha dominance of politics,” said Shravan Deore of the OBC Seva Sangh, adding that OBC numbers could be higher than 52%. He added that while the Marathas were said to be 31.5 per cent, it also included the OBC Kunbis, who formed substantial numbers in Vidarbha and Konkan. “The census will lead to a new wave of awareness and unification among the OBCs, who will demand their share of power and resources,” said former Lok Sabha MP and Shiv Sena leader Haribhau Rathod. He supported the mandate of the G Rohini Commission that is looking at an equitable distribution of the OBC quota. Pravin Gaikwad of the Maratha organization Sambhaji Brigade said: “A census to determine the number of OBCs may certainly affect the dominance of Marathas over Maharashtra’s politics.” Gaikwad pointed to how the Mandal report led to the gradual development of the OBC identity in the 1990s. This, and anger over the dynastic politics of established families in the Congress, led to a chunk of the backward vote migrating to the Shiv Sena and BJP. Writer and activist Sanjay Sonawani raised questions about the likelihood of “misreporting by respondents and the misunderstanding of data collectors.” He pointed to how some Mahadeo Koli tribals in Ahmednagar had identified themselves as Kunbis in the census conducted in the 1870s, while the Dhangars in Baramati claimed to be ‘Sagar Rajputs.’ “While communities were then trying to Sanskritise themselves, now they may try to regress in the caste ladder for quota benefits. How will the authenticity of these claims be checked,” he asked. Shabbir Ahmed Ansari of the All India Muslim OBC Organisation, called for the Central Government to undertake a comprehensive caste-census. Prakash Pawar, professor of political science at the Shivaji University, Kolhapur, said the census results could affect the political framework. Considering the substantial in-migration of non-Marathi speakers who were OBCs or SCs from other states, the politics of linguistic polarisation in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and urban centres like Pune and Nagpur, could also change. Similarly, the tensions between the OBCs and those from the open category like Marathas, Brahmins, Lingayats and Jains could also rise. Vijay Wadettiwar, minister, OBC and VJNT welfare, said the survey was meant to collect empirical data and added the state government would provide all necessary support to the Commission to undertake this. The terms of reference (TOR) will be finalised by the commission, he added. PREVIOUS CENSUS IN 1931 The last caste census was conducted in 1931 during the British rule in India Only data about SCs and STs is collected in the census OBCs are expected to be around 53% of Maharashtra’s population (43.70% Hindus and 8.40% non-Hindus). OBCs in Maharashtra are divided in the OBC category with around 350 Hindu and non-Hindu classes (19% reservations) and Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribes (VJ&NT), which covers about 50 groups (11% quotas). However, this exercise, which will map the contours of the nature of backwardness of the OBCs, is being internally referred to as survey as conducting a census is the prerogative of the Centre. The references to a caste census are found in the Rigveda and Kautilya Arthashastra. Emperor Akbar’s minister Abul Fazal mentions a comprehensive caste-based census. The SC’s decision to scrap political reservations for OBCs will affect 57,000 seats in local self-government bodies reserved for them. The elections to 18 municipal corporations including Mumbai are scheduled next year, while the term of three corporations has already ended. polls to138 municipal councils also due in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-commission-makes-way-for-caste-based-census-101628269680370.html

The pilot project has begun from Vakola nullah in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) and the entire project will be completed in 18 months. Here the main function would be collect the floating materials and recycle it. Thackeray said, “This pilot project is the first-of-its-kind in India and will transform the Mithi river. Evaluating the trial run, we aim to extend this further to the other rivers in the city.” He recalled how Mithi had turned into nullah and its effects were felt in the 2006 deluge. “The waste in the rivers is thrown by us and we need to take steps like not disposing waste in them,” he added. According to the press release issued by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), the floating matter collection and segregation will first be observed for the first three months. After this, it will segregated and analysis done by scientific means. This segregated matter will be sent for pyrolysis or recycling in phases. They will also spread awareness among the people who tend to dispose their waste in Mithi. This project is the part of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by MMRDA and Marine Debris Partnership on September 3, last year. Marine Debris Partnership is a partnership between the United Nations Technology Innovation Labs (UNTIL), the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, RiverRecycle Oy of Finland and Earth5R Environmental Services Private Limited. In the past few months, Earth5R has trained about 5,000 families on organic waste processing, compost making, and segregation of dry and recyclable waste in and around Kurla, Sion and Dharavi along Mithi River. This has helped in reduction of carbon footprint in these locations. Saurabh Gupta, founder, Earth5R, said they aimed to make it a role model in sustainable river cleaning. “Entire equipment is solar powered and we are using bio toilets, solar lamps and we want to make it a leading example in the world in sustainable river cleaning examples,” said Gupta. The 17.84-km Mithi river falls under the jurisdiction of both, BMC and MMRDA. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) in 2018 had conducted a water quality assessment of eight major state rivers in the state.

Two of the protesters had climbed atop a streetlight pole, along with a child, over their demand of regularisation of jobs. The child could be brought down only after great difficulty. Civil lines station house officer (SHO) Gurpreet Singh Bhindar said the protesters threatened to jump from streetlight poles, if their demands were not met. “We have named nine protesters in the FIR, while 900 unidentified persons have also been booked,” he added.Balihar Singh, state president of Powercom and Transco contractual employees union, claimed, “On Thursday, police resorted to lathi-charge for no reason as we were holding a peaceful march towards the residence of the chief minister.” “We were protesting along with our families and children. The government had failed to listen our demands, following which two of the protestors climbed atop a street-light, with a child,” he said.Police have registered a case under Sections 309 (attempt to suicide) and Section 387 (Putting person in fear of death or of grievous hurt to commit extortion), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public function) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/day-after-protest-900-powercom-workers-booked-for-suicide-bid-101628269080172.html
06-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: IIT-B makes gender awareness course must for students||Students of the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) will now have to take a compulsory course in gender awareness. The course is aimed at sensitising students about gender discrimination and inequality. For the first time in the institute’s history of 63 years, a compulsory, zero credit gender awareness course will be offered to students at all levels. The institute’s senate passed the course in a meeting held last week. While many institutes offer gender sensitisation workshops for students, this is likely the first time that an IIT has instituted a mandatory course for the same. Last year, IIT-B renamed its women’s cell – meant for handling sexual harassment complaints – to the gender cell. It is this cell that has designed the course, said director Subhasis Chaudhuri.In a joint statement to HT, Rowena Robinson, convenor of the Gender Cell and Sahana Murthy, co-convenor, said, “In accordance with the law (Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013) and IIT-B policy against sexual harassment, the institute, through its Gender Cell, aims to ensure gender awareness and sensitisation for all students and employees. The new course ‘Gender in the workplace’ rolling out for students soon, and subsequently for all staff and faculty, is in online mode in both English and Hindi and its objective is to sensitise individuals about broader issues of gender discrimination and inequality.” IITs have traditionally had very few women students apply for their courses. To address this lack of visibility of women, IITs have now introduced supernumerary seats to increase the number of women students to 20%. While these steps have improved the number of women studying Science, data shows that not many are retained in the field thereafter. According to a 2020 report by the United Nations, 43% of all graduates in STEM fields in India are women—the highest in the world. However, the report also found that only 14% of 2.8 lakh scientists, engineers and technologists employed in research institutions in the country are women. Robinson, professor in the department of humanities and social sciences, and Murthy, professor in the interdisciplinary program in education technology, said, “We believe it’s the first time that an online course of this nature is being initiated for all members of the institute. Students at all levels will be expected to complete this course. We are not aware of an instance like this. However, some IITs do conduct workshops and orientations on gender issues.”They said that the course— a pass/ no pass self-study one— will talk about how sexual harassment is a blatant form of gender inequality. “While it focuses on how the institute exercises its responsibility in dealing with this issue, it also emphasizes that it needs to be addressed collectively and that each member of the institute has an important role to play. The course lays out the systemic issues of patriarchy and power and associated gender stereotypes that underlie gender discrimination and sexual harassment. It emphasises that it is important to understand this social and cultural context to bring about a change in attitudes and tackle gender inequalities and sexual harassment seriously,” said Robinson and Murthy.Chaudhuri said, “Preponderance of a specific gender in classrooms, which is quite prevalent in technical universities, may lead to the unwanted asymmetrisation in behavioural traits of students in their formative years, apart from the undesirable stereotyping of the opposite sex. We hope that such mandatory training will make our students more appreciative and respectful to the other gender(s), thus making the IIT-B experience an enjoyable one to all students.” Robinson and Murthy said that the course is likely to be made available online for other educational institutions to train their students and faculty. “Gender Cell understands that gender sensitivity and awareness in the modern, global corporate workplace is no longer merely an issue of compliance with the law but is a competence that is highly valued. Hence, it is important for us to train and enhance the knowledge and capacities of our students to fit seamlessly and contribute more effectively in gender-diverse teams, offices and workplaces anywhere in the world,” they said.Currently women constitute less than 20% of the total undergraduate student population. Prajval Shastri, astrophysicist retired from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bengaluru, who advocates intersectional feminism in academic spaces, said, “Better late than never! The HSS department and the lead faculty for the course must be congratulated on this amazing achievement. This means that finally there is acknowledgement from the management of an institute of higher education that gender inequity is systemic, rooted in patriarchy of mindsets perforce creeping into academic and campus life - a phenomenon that would be obvious to a social scientist but not commonly accepted by our science leaders so far. Presumably the design of the course tests for significant mindset shifts as a result of the course. I hope the hands of the lead faculty are strengthened by making the course mandatory for all institute faculty and staff including senior management, which will elevate it to being a valued course. It is most commendable and appropriate that the course from this public institution will be made widely available, which is bound to have far-reaching impact.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-iit-b-makes-gender-awareness-course-must-for-students-101628268841260.html

The minister met the CM on Friday and submitted a memorandum to that effect. In a social media post, the minister said the CM has assured to look into the demand.In his memorandum to the CM, Thakur underlined that people in the three districts in Palamu division and Chatra district in North Chhotangpur speak Bhojpuri and Magahi and if these languages are not included in the regional language options, candidates from these districts would not be able to apply for job examinations organised by the JSSC. The minister further said that these two languages are also prevalent in several north Chhottanagpur districts, including Hazaribag, Koderma, Dhanbad and Bokaro..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jmm-minister-urges-cm-to-include-bhojpuri-magahi-in-jssc-examinations-101628268480091.html
06-08-2021||Ranchi||BJP says Soren govt’s new employment policy discriminatory; JMM calls decision historic||In another round of controversy surrounding the employment policy in Jharkhand, the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday accused the Hemant Soren government of coming up with a “discriminatory policy” in terms of language and region, saying it was detrimental for Hindi speaking population and those belonging to the unreserved category in the state. The development comes a day after the Hemant Soren cabinet on Thursday cleared proposals amending the employment eligibility and syllabus for the examinations conducted by the Jharkhand Staff Selection Commission (JSSC) for grade III and IV government jobs.The new policy replaced the two-stage examination conducted by the JSSC with a single-stage competition. It also made it mandatory that anyone who does not belong to the reserved categories notified in the state must have passed Class 10 and 12 from any Jharkhand school to apply for a job offered by the JSSC.While the exact syllabus for the new exam pattern was yet to be published by the commission, the new examination pattern made it mandatory to clear a language paper from a given list of 12 regional languages, including tribal languages. Hindi and English exams will be the qualifying papers and the marks obtained in opted regional language exam will be added to the merit list.Addressing reporters at the party headquarters here Friday, Jharkhand BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said that the new policy approved by the state government was discriminatory against the official language Hindi, besides being an attempt to appease the minority community. The party would take all measures, political as well as legal, to ensure that the new policy is not implemented.“Earlier, subjects like Hindi, Sanskrit and Urdu were also in the list of main language papers. But the new policy has kept Urdu but dropped Hindi and Sanskrit out of it. By the new policy, the government is discriminating against people living in certain regions of the state,” said Shahdeo. “In districts like Palamu and Garhwa, many people speak Bhojpuri. Similarly, a majority of people in the Godda and Sahebganj districts speak Angika. While these languages have not been listed in the regional language, Hindi could have been a common link. But residents of these districts would not be able to appear for these posts,” he added.On the new rule of passing out Class 10 and 12 from a school in the state, Shahdeo said that it discriminates against the general category students who are Moolvasis (original inhabitants) of Jharkhand. However, the ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) denied the charges saying the new policy was in the interest of the locals, including the tribals, Dalit, backward classes and the Moolvasis of the state. “There should be no confusion on this. Everyone whose umbilical cord is attached to the state would benefit from this policy, which is historic. Till now, there were too many loopholes in the employment policy that were used by people to challenge it in court. On the language front, instead of appeasement, we are assimilating all sections of society. Urdu was declared the second state language by the previous BJP government. As far as regional language is concerned, its importance lies in the fact that they act as a catalyst in governance as common people who interact with grade 3 and 4 category employees can express their problems properly in their mother tongue,” said JMM principal general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya. Domicile and employment policy in Jharkhand has been a controversial issue and a hot potato for all political parties ever since this tribal-dominated state was carved out of Bihar in 2000. Bringing an end to the uncertainties over the issue, the previous BJP government led by Raghubar Das had fixed 1985 as the base year for deciding on the domicile of any citizen in the state.The issue continued to be a controversy and became a major talking point in the 2019 Assembly election when the BJP lost power, with other political parties, especially the JMM and the Congress, taking a contrary stand and promising to change it. However, the JMM-Congress-RJD combined government was yet to come up with a new proposal on the issue.The employment policy notified by the Raghubar Das government also turned into a controversy as the high court had struck down its policy to reserve jobs offered by the JSSC in 11 scheduled districts -- as per Schedule V of the Constitution -- only for the locals from those respective districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/bjp-says-soren-govt-s-new-employment-policy-discriminatory-jmm-calls-decision-historic-101628268301321.html
06-08-2021||Patna||JD (U) will become number one in state: Lalan Singh||On his maiden visit to the state after assuming the post of JD(U) national president, Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh assured the party men that he will work hard to make the party number one in Bihar. Speaking at a felicitation ceremony organised at the party office on Friday, Singh thanked the workers and leaders associated with the party. “I will honestly discharge the responsibility entrusted to me by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar,” he said.“The job of the president is to protect the honour of the workers associated with the party and listen to them as they are the backbone of the party. The job of the president is to take everyone along,” said the Munger MP and asked the workers to pull their socks to take the work of Nitish Kumar to every house of the state.An analysis of the party’s poor performance during the 2020 assembly elections was the failure of the rank and file to properly propagate the works of chief minister Nitish Kumar, which revealed the party sources. On the other hand, the BJP effectively propagated the PM’s work and schemes.The party’s endeavour to become number one in Bihar is borne by the fact that JD (U) which had 89 MLAs in 2005 and was the single largest party increased its tally to 115 in 2010 and retained its number one position. However, it slipped to the second position in the 2015 assembly polls with 71 seats which it contested in alliance with the RJD which became the number one party with 80 seats. And in the 2020 assembly polls, JD (U) slipped further with just 43 seats while RJD retained the number one slot with 75 seats and the BJP becoming number two with 74 seats. Singh, who belongs to the Bhumihar community, was accorded a rousing welcome in the state capital. “I promise that I will stand shoulder to shoulder. Whenever I stay in Patna, I will be there for the workers in the office from noon. During this, I will leave the office in the evening after listening to each of the workers. I am grateful for the way I have been welcomed today,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/jd-u-will-become-number-one-in-state-lalan-singh-101628268120256.html

The exam recorded over 90% attendance, according to information provided by the exam management committee. While the arrangements were in place inside exam halls as per Covid-19 protocols, the candidates flouted social distancing norms outside the centres. Large crowds were seen outside the exam venues in the morning in most districts. “The BEd exam was held successfully across the state with no untoward incident being reported. We used latest technologies to ensure that the exam was held in a fair manner,” said state coordinator Amita Bajpai. “Further process, including results and counselling will also be done in a fair manner,” she added. The exam was held in two shifts of three hours each. The first shift was between 9 am to 12 pm while the second shift was held between 2pm to 5pm. The paper included multiple choice questions which were to be answered on an optimal mark reader paper. The question paper in both shifts comprised 100 questions each. A total of 5.91 lakh students registered for the exam of which 5.3 lakh appeared in the exam. Of these, 28141 students took the exam in the state capital. All the candidates appearing in the exam were provided a Covid-19 protective kit comprising masks, face shield and sanitiser. To avoid use of unfair means, the management used artificial intelligence-based technology. “We have identified some suspected candidates. Their mark sheets will be scrutinised carefully before releasing the result,” said Bajpai.

06-08-2021||Mumbai||Agriculture in 25 districts of Maharashtra vulnerable to climate changes, says study||A new study by researchers from two Central government institutes — both under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) — has found that just over two-thirds of arable land in Maharashtra is vulnerable to climate change-related impacts, such as drought, floods, and diminishing water security.Of the state’s 36 districts, 11 were found to be highly vulnerable to climate-related agricultural distress (making up 40% of cropped land), while another 14 districts (making up 37% of the state’s agricultural land) were found to be moderately vulnerable to climate change. These districts are all spread out over eastern Vidarbha and central Maharashtra.The study, titled ‘Socio-economic vulnerability to climate change – Index development and mapping for districts in Maharashtra’, was led by researchers Chaitanya Adhav (from the ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute in Karnal, Haryana) and Dr R Sendhil (from ICAR-Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research in Karnal).Adhav, who is originally from Ahmednagar district in Maharashtra, clarified that his paper (available as a pre-print on the Social Science Research Network) is currently awaiting peer review, and has been submitted to an internal environmental journal for publication. Mumbai city and suburban districts have been excluded from the scope of the study.“Maharashtra has been selected purposively for this study as the state is severely facing rainfall and temperature anomalies along with persistent droughts and many climatic factors impacting agriculture and allied activities,” the authors have noted in their paper. Citing the example of water scarcity during the Kharif season (June to October) of 2018-19, which affected 151 talukas (blocks) across 26 districts, the authors note that such incidents “signify a key threat to communities that depend on agriculture for food and livelihoods”.To quantify the risk faced by 34 of the state’s districts, Adhav and his team developed a “climate change-induced socioeconomic vulnerability index (SeVI) comprising various socio-economic as well as crop and dairy indicators” using a methodology prescribed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to assess regional-level climate vulnerability. IPCC’s model categorises various indicators into three categories: exposure, sensitivity and adaptability.For the study, a total of 44 indicators were selected after expert consultations and literature reviews. Under the exposure vertical of the IPCC’s assessment, for example, indicators include trends in temperature for summer, Kharif and rabi crop season, along with trends in humidity and meteorological drought. Under the sensitivity vertical, indicators include data on population density, irrigation capabilities, size of operational holdings for small and marginal farmers, groundwater availability, and farmer suicides among others. Finally, under the adaptivity vertical, data on literacy rate, human development index (HDI), several fair price shops in the district, crop diversity and subsidised food grain distribution were considered.After assigning an index value to each district, under each of these verticals, a composite socio-economic index value was computed to assess the district’s overall risk and preparedness to deal with climate-related distress. The Socioeconomic Vulnerability Index was highest in Nandurbar, the authors have noted. Other districts categorised as ‘highly vulnerable’ include Buldhana, Beed, Jalna, Aurangabad, Hingoli, Parbhani, Nanded, Akola, Amravati and Washim.Another 14 districts were categorised as ‘moderately vulnerable’, including Dhule, Jalgaon, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Sangli, Solapur, Osmanabad, Latur, Yavatmal, Wardha, Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gondia and Gadchiroli. Across both degrees of vulnerability, the main cash crops which are likely to bear the brunt of changing climate trends include jowar, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton, ragi, cashew nut, barley, and millets, the authors have cautioned. Meanwhile, nine districts including Palghar, Thane, Raigad, Nashik, Satara, Kolhapur, Ahmednagar, Nagpur and Pune were found to be least vulnerable to climate agricultural distress.Expressing concern over these findings, Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD student at University of Reading in England, said, “The last decade alone has shown us severe droughts in 2014, 2015 and 2018, massive hailstorms in 2014 and 2015, and excess rainfall in 2016, 2019 and 2021 that led to significant flooding in western parts of the state. In the absence of proper irrigation in Marathwada and Vidarbha, fluctuations in the monsoon rainfall will affect sowing and crop growth, resulting in a high vulnerability to crop yield. Even this year, districts across northern Maharashtra such as Dhule, Nandurbar, Jalgaon, Nashik and parts of western Vidarbha have witnessed a very low number of monsoon rainfall days, impacting Kharif sowing. Proper and lucid advisories could have prevented farmers from sowing in June, which would have mitigated the resultant financial stress.”Vijay Anna Borade, trustee, Marathwada Sheti Sahayak Mandal (MSSM), also agreed with Adhav’s analysis. “What we are witnessing now is a concern because, on one hand, the number of rainy days in a year has reduced drastically while on the other hand areas in Marathwada, which usually receive very little rainfall, are now being flooded. Changing crop patterns is a solution but we also need to create parallel programs to tackle the lack of drainage, irrigation and facilitate efficient crop rotation to ensure stable incomes and productivity. There is a lot of discussion on climate change and agriculture, but it is very little on-ground action.”Speaking to HT over the phone, Adhav expressed particular worry for districts that scored low on the adaptivity index in his analysis. “Some of the districts which were found to be the least adaptable, like Beed, have already seen extremely high numbers of farmer suicides.

However, Kapoor has raised objections against CBI’s plea. CBI has alleged that Kapoor and his wife bought a bungalow from Avantha Group promoter Gautam Thapar at a much lower price than its valuation. In the past, Thapar had mortgaged the bungalow for a corporate loan of ₹600 crore, but he sold it for ₹380 crore to Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd, in which Kapoor’s wife was a director at the time.Kapoor is currently in judicial custody after being arrested in March 2019 in connection with the Yes Bank fraud case.The CBI on Friday approached the special CBI court for a production warrant to interrogate Kapoor. Kapoor’s lawyer Pranav Badheka, in response, moved a plea questioning the maintainability of CBI’s plea for production warrant. He pleaded with the court to hear the objections before passing any order.Special judge SU Wadgaonkar, who is scheduled to hear the plea on Saturday, said that the prayers and the objection to maintainability on behalf of the accused also needs to be considered.The special CBI court had in September last year rejected Kapoor’s plea for anticipatory bail in this case. Besides, Thapar has been recently arrested by Enforcement Directorate in Delhi in connection with money laundering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cbi-seeks-rana-kapoor-s-custody-in-avantha-case-101628262839138.html

A preliminary inquiry related to the exam was registered at the Delhi branch of the CBI against unknown officers of the UPPSC and other unknown persons in pursuance of an order of the UP government (dated September 4, 2018) and a corresponding notification (dated January 15, 2019) by the central government for conducting probe into the alleged irregularities in the recruitment exam, the officials said. “Prima facie, criminality has been found against Prabhunath, other UPPSC officials and some unknown persons. Prabhunath and other officials entered into criminal conspiracy with each other to extend undue benefit to some of the undeserving candidates for their selection as additional private secretary through the APS exam-2010 conducted by UPPSC. They selected some undeserving candidates,” the officials said. It was decided by the UPPSC that the candidates who had applied for the post of additional private secretary would have to appear and qualify General Hindi, Hindi Short Hand test.The Hindi Short Hand test was of 135 marks and candidates had to obtain minimum 125 to qualify after relaxation of 5% errors, as per rule. It was decided that if the number of candidates who had obtained minimum 125 (or committed mistakes below 5%) and marks were not available then, in such circumstances, the commission could apply its discretionary power (further relaxation of extra 3% and total up to 8% errors). And such candidates who obtained minimum 119 marks (or committed mistakes up to 8% marks) could also be considered as qualified for the third phase of examination i.e. computer knowledge test, the FIR pointed out. The CBI probe found that 913 qualified candidates out of 1,244 were such candidates who had obtained minimum 125 marks (committed mistakes up to 5%) and 331 candidates had obtained marks between 119-124 (committed mistakes up to 8%) in Hindi Short Hand test. In such circumstances, as per approval of the commission, when sufficient number of candidates were available for final selection then there was no need to give 3% extra relaxation in errors and they should have not been qualified for 3rd phase of examination, stated the complaint. Further as per rule and decision of the commission, only 913 candidates should have been considered qualified for computer knowledge test, but the same decision was violated by Prabhunath along with other officials to give undue favour to some non-deserving candidates and allowed to qualify total 1,244 candidates, the CBI FIR stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbi-registers-fir-against-former-coe-of-uppsc-101628256659486.html

The SDO did not inform any of the varsity authorities, except his immediate superior, an executive engineer. The higher education department had acted on the basis of a state vigilance report. The overpayment was made during the tenure of former vice-chancellor Jaspal Singh, with the vigilance naming three officers, one of whom has died. The projects were the construction of the Masters of Business Administration (MBA) building, the University College of Engineering, renovation of hostels and the teaching block.“The SDO concerned has already stopped attending office. He only intimated his reporting manager, who is the executive engineer, that he is resigning,” an official said.Executive engineer Manjeet Singh Sidhu confirmed that Cheema has tendered his resignation. “I am not aware of any pending inquiry against him,” he added.Vice-chancellor Arvind said Cheema had approached his office for taking Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS), but his file was not processed as he has a pending recovery case against him. “There is a process in place for tendering resignation, and for its acceptance,” the V-C said, adding that the varsity has sought legal advise on how to apportion the division of recovery amount among those named in the vigilance report. “The university will recover the required amount, once the report is in,” he said.“Even if Cheema has resigned, the university can recover its money from the financial benefits due to him for his services,” said a varsity official, not wanting to be named. Cheema could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.The vigilance had investigated the construction projects on an anonymous complaint it had received in 2017.

06-08-2021||Patna||All Bihar district hospitals to be made feeding bottle-free by end of 2022||All district hospitals across Bihar will be milk bottle-free by December 2022. As of now, 12 district hospitals have been declared milk bottle-free.The state health society, department of health and family welfare, has been working with the technical support of the UNICEF, Bihar, to encourage breastfeeding and end bottle feeding. To achieve the target of completely eliminating bottle feeding from all district hospitals by the end of 2022, a special awareness drive has been planned. The Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) counsellors at hospitals will make the hospital staff aware about the adverse impacts of bottle feeding. They would also be asked to ensure breastfeeding within an hour of birth. Besides, special breastfeeding rooms will be developed at all the health institutions to promote this practice.  “For the last two-three years we have been trying to make district hospitals bottle-free. We have been able to achieve this target in 12 district hospitals: Arwal, Bhagalpur, Gaya, Jehanabad, Khagaria, Muzaffarpur, Purnea, Samastipur, Saran, Sheikhpura, and Sitamarhi. Now there’s the target to make all district hospitals milk bottle-free by the end of 2022,” Dr Vijay Prakash Rai, programme officer, child health at the State Health Society, said. Also Read | Bihar human rights panel team visits Bettiah jail over prisoner complaintsFocus is on the effective implementation of the Infant Milk Substitutes (Feeding Bottles and Infant Foods) Act. Activities like promotion of milk substitute or feeding bottles would be banned on the hospital premises. The Act, further amended in 2003, bans all forms of promotion of foods marketed to children up to two years of age. However, Nipurn Gupta, communication expert, Unicef, Bihar, said the concept of bottle-free hospitals is to ensure breastfeeding. But in case a mother has a lactation problem, counsellors help her in identifying the problem, she said. “This kind of problem is mainly related to mental health of the mother. So the effort is made to sort out the issue through counselling and emotional support. In case there’s a need of medical treatment, that too is made available,” she said.Sometimes, the newborn is too weak to suckle. In that case, hospital staff try to collect mother’s milk and feed the baby with a spoon, she added.Dr Shivani Dar, nutrition expert from Unicef, Bihar, said bottle feeding is unsafe and should never be encouraged. “Most of the serious infections in newborn are through feeding bottles. Even among children in the age groups of three months to two years, problems such as diarrhoea or malnutrition are caused by feeding bottles ,” she said. Bimalesh Sinha, deputy director, child health, state health society, said,“Some basic infrastructure is required for this practice... Breastfeeding rooms will be provided at all the hospitals.” All ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activists) workers, ANM (Auxiliary Nurse Midwife) and the anganbadi women have been asked to visit door-to-door to identify pregnant women and make them aware about breastfeeding, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/all-bihar-district-hospitals-to-be-made-feeding-bottle-free-by-end-of-2022-101628252999059.html
06-08-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: The Maverick Kapoor||Perhaps Aditya Raj Kapoor’s personal journey is even more remarkable than his round-the-world trip, undertaken alone on a motorcycle at 61. The son of two stars of the Indian film industry — late Geeta Bali and Shammi Kapoor, it could be said that on his birth, Aditya or Mickey’s future had been cut out for him, as well fitting as a suit from Mumbai’s famous Kachins Tailors: after his schooling he’d work as an AD at RK Studios, while simultaneously being groomed by his family’s ecosystem into a shining star who’d soon climb the ladder of fame, fortune and unbridled fandom. Who is not familiar with the Kapoor story? A legendary patriarch with his brood of swashbuckling actor-sons, each an icon in his own right; a life of endless glamor and glitz; of parties, previews and premieres; and of course, those famous Holi bashes where Sitara Devi had danced, and Raj Kapoor had played his dholak… Except, this Kapoor’s life hadn’t followed the conventional formulae or screenplay; in fact, there had been a sudden veering away from the script, quite early on. As he tells it, his mother’s sudden and tragic death when he was nine had resulted in a troubled childhood and a lost young man; the saving grace had been that through it all his stepmother Neela Devi’s steadfast love and support had resulted in Kapoor living a life completely unlike that of his clan. “I was never a biker. Biking was never in my vision. I was about 56 when I bought my first bike and past 60 when I finished my round the world trip,” says Kapoor, about his journey which he embarked on in June 2017 in Mumbai and which had seen him ride through 15 countries including Russia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France, England, America, Indonesia Thailand and Myanmar — a journey that had taken 315 days and covered a staggering 35,000 kms. But remarkable as it is, a journey perhaps not as extraordinary as the one he’d embarked on as a young man. *****************************************Speaking to Aditya, one realises that his epic journey had begun much earlier, when he’d been introduced at 17 by his stepmother to her guru, an enigmatic spiritual master called Bholey Baba of Haidakhan, Uttarakhand. This was when on the verge of a promising debut as a film star, on the single sentence of his guru, Kapoor had upset the apple cart and overnight turned his back on the film industry, to dedicate himself to a life of considerable hardship and devotion in his ashram. “There I was, a star son, brought up in Malabar Hill. And life at the ashram was completely alien to anything I’d known,” he says. “We had to rise at 3.30am to bathe in the river then perform a havan followed by an arti by 8am. Then the day’s hard labour began — carrying rocks for construction of a bridge, sweeping the ashram, settling footwear or preparing meals and collecting buckets of water and carrying them up 108 steps…” On the wishes of his guru who, he says, had revealed his entire future to him one day while sitting on a riverbank, Kapoor had married Priti, a fellow devotee and had become a businessman. Eschewing the glamorous life of his family and rarely being seen in public, he’d lived and worked away from the public eye in the Middle East with his devoted wife and their two kids. Upon retirement, he’d returned to India and that’s when he’d bought his first bike, on the prompting of his son, himself a biker. So, had his guru predicted his trip? “A guru doesn’t hand you a typed statement. Mostly he communicates in shrouded meanings, parables and poems,” says Kapoor, adding, “Once, a devotee had given Babaji a watch as a gift, which he’d promptly fastened around my wrist saying, “This watch will go around the world!” When I planned my world trip, I knew I would complete it, because of that.” *****************************************It is difficult to even imagine the profound courage it must have taken Kapoor to embark on a world trip, all alone, riding in unfamiliar terrain and unpredictable situations. According to him, he’d inherited this courage from his late mother. “She was extraordinarily courageous,” he says. “Her father had been a revered philosopher and at a very young age she’d travelled extensively by ship with him on his preaching pilgrimages, and very early on, she had decided to become the breadwinner for her family, defying all convention and patriarchal norms, even running away from Amritsar to Lahore for a radio singing assignment. Once, after their marriage, when my parents were out on shikar, my father said that she had been so fascinated by a tiger that she’d got out of the car and sat on the bonnet to admire it fearlessly.” Kapoor says, “She must have put all that into me.” *****************************************To understand what it was like to be alone on his Triumph Bonneville circumnavigating the globe, one must read Kapoor’s recently published Quest — a meticulous diary, replete with colourful insights, anecdotes and photographs of the innumerable exhilarating experiences he’d encountered along the way, including traversing the challenging Trans-Siberian Highway, bedding down in various idiosyncratic AirBnBs and roadside dhaaba meals that had sustained him. Above all, it is a chronicle of the warm, vibrant people he’d met on the journey, many of them devotees of his Guru, at ashrams across the four corners of the world. “I had made up my mind to visit people and not monuments,” he says. “And I met all of them. Strangers who helped me with directions, some who gave me free food or shelter. One who even danced with me!” he says, adding, “No one discussed politics or the state of the world or their country, or mine. There is goodness in all people. You must reach out, or you will miss out on the best creation of God.” So now that he has a solo world trip under his belt, what’s next for this free spirited, maverick Kapoor? Having recently moved with his wife to Goa and enrolled in a course in philosophy, Kapoor has developed two new interests: a website he has launched to assist others in their spiritual development and composing music — a passion he shared with his father. “My wife presented me with a keyboard and my daughter Tulsi, who is a musician, helps. When I told her I could not read music, she said: “Neither could Michael Jackson.” So, I put my fingers on the keys and played!” he laughs.

06-08-2021||Other||Global Village Idiot: An Olympic vision for a culture of sports is how India must play it||It seems we won more medals than we did at the last Olympics. Personally, I was thrilled with how our sports people competed in different disciplines - win or lose - because it takes a tremendous amount of courage and resilience to perform at the top level, especially when you don’t come from a nation where sports is a culture, and where performance is not an everyday attitude. Each performance was creditable, and each medal was a triumph against very difficult odds.Sports could lift many out of poverty and propel many others into the next level of economic existence, but the odds are heavily stacked against that in the absence of a significant and consistent investment at various levels of society, facilitated by a government spending on infrastructure. For a government to prioritise sports spending requires sustained demand from the media and citizens.I have lived in Delhi, Mumbai and Pune. Growing up, I spent three years (Grades 8-10) at the Union Academy School in Delhi in the 1980s and the biggest differentiator for a kid living in Delhi is the sports infrastructure and sports culture. And that infrastructure and culture starts with the school’s coach and the physical training team. In those three years, I won a gold medal and certificate as part of the school’s football team that won the Zonal U-16 football trophy. I also won silver and bronze medals at the Delhi interschool athletics and went up to the quarters and semis in consequent sub-junior national tournaments in table-tennis. My greatest pride came in cheering from the stands whenever our school’s hockey team took the field. Our school was (and still is) famous for its outstanding hockey team, having produced several players who went on to play for the India men’s team, as also players who became sports administrators and coaches. We had a city rivalry with Modern School Barakhamba road and DPS RK Puram. Our sports days used to be held at Shivaji Stadium in Connaught Place, which we considered our home ground, given our hockey credentials. Talkatora Stadium and pool was a venue frequented for the many interschool tournaments - my most memorable table-tennis matches were at Talkatora. My elder cousin was part of the Delhi U-19 cricket team, which meant we occasionally got to watch Test matches at Ferozshah Kotla. Visits to play and watch football games at Ambedkar Stadium were par for the course. Our school team qualified for the Subroto Cup one of those years, and though I was on the bench through all our draws and defeats, it was a great experience being run ragged by Madhyamgram High School (West Bengal) and a Russian school team.The city newspapers were of importance to school students because reporters regularly covered these tournaments and reported on local champions, competitive rivalries and school records. Not just as a tiny mention, but proper reports. They ran extensive articles asking questions on coaching and infrastructure. Their opinion mattered and influenced sports performance. After high school, I moved back to Mumbai where serious sports is more at club-level than school, but reasonably big on the college circuit. Again, local newspapers covered educational and club sports, though selectively, but the association with clubs kept the interest and performance going. Mumbai was geared to a professional career and enthusiasm for sports eventually used to wear down to a hobby, since infrastructure was not that great and when it was, it wasn’t as easily accessible as in Delhi. Coaches were even harder to come by unless you were playing cricket.When I landed in Pune in 1996, I was struck by the local sports culture at the school level, including the availability of coaches and considerable coverage by all local newspapers. And after the 2008 Youth Commonwealth Games, Balewadi stadium added the much-needed upgrade to facilities. Pune had a vibrant sports culture across many sports, mainly tennis, swimming, football, badminton and athletics. But, specially swimming.In the past decade, many schools have come up with really good sports infrastructure and with a globalisation of the curriculum, more schools talk sports and talk the importance of holistic education and organise their own sporting events.I am a parent, still very enthusiastic about playing and propagating sports. Our eldest swims and competes at the inter-school and district level tournaments, trying to improve his timings and has the advantage of a peer group at his swimming club. The younger ones are finding their sports.I can quite honestly say that it’s an uphill task if left to the schools. Schools don’t seem particularly interested in developing sporting talent, as much as they are in selling the idea that they have sports integrated into their curriculum. A lot of this comes from the fact that they are addressing their market, parents. And the bulk of the parents in any given school like their children playing, but come Grade 5, their focus shifts to academics. And that’s what schools are focused on. Every school has a handful of parents who are focused on sports and who want their children to have the option of a sporting career, if talent indicates so. These are a minority. I remember groups of parents from different international schools who, not only took a keen interest, but also joined the parent committees to drive the school management to really walk the talk beyond infrastructure. All of them eventually gave up because they realised that schools don’t listen to minority voices.Nations that do well consistently have multiple athletes in different sports capable of making the qualifying mark and most of them have a career in sports, with achievements going back to school days. The pressure of performance is shared by a peer group and it leads to healthy competition, unlike in developing nations where the pressure is usually on a handful of sports persons, who are built up by the media and then dropped till the next Olympics.I always used to wonder what happens to the great players and swimmers and athletes I used to see at the school level. I guess they all got caught up in the need to make a living and decided that sports wouldn’t make them a living.Nowadays, I wonder, what is the point of schools having the physical infrastructure, but lacking the vision and desire to use it to develop talent that comes through to them.There is a great hope. The archers, and shooters, and athletes, will have their day… one day. Of all the medals we won, Sindhu’s badminton bronze and the hockey bronze have sustainability significance because they represent a coming together of infrastructure, government support, individual performance and coaching excellence over decades. If more states adopted specific sports to develop like Odisha has stood by hockey, and if more schools across the country make sports a matter of achievement, a legacy would fall into place. And then, maybe, more parents would believe in the talent their children have, and a better sports culture will evolve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/global-village-idiot-an-olympic-vision-for-a-culture-of-sports-is-how-india-must-play-it-101628246939290.html

Following the complaint, a five-member committee was constituted to look into her charges. “The final tabulation sheet is signed by six examiners. One of the internal examiners produced a rough sheet with some numbers crossed...it appeared that some marks had intentionally been deducted,” he said. On the student being failed deliberately, the principal said all the reports and related papers were set to Rajasthan University of Health Sciences but they will continue with the previous result as it was signed by all the six invigilators.

06-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai local: BJP holds protest; fully vaccinated people likely to be allowed soon||Several BJP leaders were arrested and penalised for protesting and forcibly travelling in Mumbai local trains, as part of their pre-decided protest, on Friday. Protests were held at Sion, Dahisar, Kandivali and Andheri. BJP leader Pravin Darekar was penalised for travelling from Churchgate to Charni Road without any ticket. Mumbai local trains, the lifeline of Mumbai and suburb's transport, is not open for the general public a long-standing demand of the daily passengers, which has now become a political issue.The Maharashtra government has indicated that it will soon take a decision on allowing fully vaccinated people to travel by Mumbai locals.Minister Aaditya Thackeray said the decision will be made public in a few days as the government has been holding a series of consultations with experts. "I think one should act in a responsible manner [in giving relaxations]. In other countries where vaccination has been done [to a large extent], like in the US, UK, the cases are rising again. We are concerned about people's lives. About [restarting] railways, we have been holding deliberations for the past few weeks. In the next two, three days, you will know what relaxations can be given for the double vaccinated population, not just in trains but in other activities as well. We are carefully discussing these issues and you will know about it soon," the minister said.Mumbai local was opened for the general public with some time restrictions in February just ahead of the arrival of the second wave. As of now, only specific categories of travellers related to essential and emergency services are allowed to travel in Mumbai local trains.Resentment has been growing against the government's decision to keep local services restricted as lawyers too have moved the court demanding that they should be allowed to travel in Mumbai local trains. The Bombay high court on Monday urged the state to consider forming an expert panel to look into the woes of the commuters.Travelling by train in Mumbai is essential for people..bus charges are very high. These are important issues which touch the livelihood of people… so if the administrative machinery is geared up to look into these issues, everything would be fine," Justice Kulkarni said.(With inputs from Swapnil Rawal and Surendra P Gangan)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-local-bjp-holds-protest-fully-vaccinated-people-likely-to-be-allowed-soon-101628237910500.html

06-08-2021||Kolkata||TMC delegation to meet state poll officer in Bengal today; seek early bypolls||A delegation of the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal is likely to meet the state’s chief electoral officer today with the plea to hold bypolls in the state at the earliest. Elections in two assembly seats are pending, and so are bypolls in five assembly constituencies, including Bhabanipur in south Kolkata from where chief minister Mamata Banerjee is expected to contest. “A team of TMC leaders will meet the election commission officials in the state on holding elections and bypolls, which are pending,” said Partha Chatterjee, state minister and TMC’s secretary general. Even though the TMC returned to power for the third consecutive term, Banerjee was defeated in Nandigram by her protégé-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari of BJP. Banerjee took oath as the chief minister on May 5 and will now have to get elected within six months from May to continue on the post. The TMC-delegation comprising parliamentarians met the full bench of the Election Commission of India on July 15, seeking bypolls at the earliest.

Two other TMC legislators died after contracting Covid-19 infection, while TMC MLA from Bhabanipur, Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, resigned so that Banerjee could contest from the seat in the bypolls. “By-elections should be held as early as possible.

LJP MP from Jamui in Bihar Chirag Paswan, who is locked in a tussle with uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras over party control, will launch a road show, Ashirwad Yatra, across Uttar Pradesh after August 15 to mobilise the party workers.The yatra is along the lines of a similar roadshow Paswan is holding in Bihar.He will meet Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow during the yatra. The LJP had earlier contested assembly elections in UP in 2007 and 2012 under the leadership of party founder Ram Vilas Paswan.In the first phase, the Ashirwad Yatra will be organised in Ballia, Azamgarh, Gorakhpur, Bhadohi, Mirzapur, Lucknow, Shahjhanpur, Bareilly, Moradabad, Saharanpur, Meerut and Ghaziabad, LJP’s Uttar Pradesh unit president Mani Shankar Pandey said.Paswan launched the Ashirwad Yatra at Vaishali in Bihar on July 5 to mark the birth anniversary of his father late Ram Vilas Paswan.The JD(U) that is running the government in Bihar in alliance with the BJP has announced it will field candidates on 200 seats in the 2022 UP assembly election. JD (U) state president said the party had decided to contest the assembly election on its own strength. “The district unit presidents have been directed to strengthen the organisation and hold a membership drive across UP,” he said. Meanwhile HAM(S) leader Santosh Suman Manjhi, who is a minister in the Bihar government, met chief minister Yogi Adityanath this Monday. “The Hindustani Awam Morcha (S) has decided to contest assembly elections in UP in alliance with the BJP.

Sahani said VIP will field candidates on various seats in the coming assembly election and “fight for the rights of and justice to the suppressed communities”.RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav’s meeting with SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav in Delhi on Monday has set off a buzz about their alliance for the coming assembly elections.

The court on July 29 sought a response from the Delhi Police on bail application moved by Hussain in the case. Justice Mukta Gupta issued a notice and directed that the bail application be listed before Justice Yogesh Khanna, who is hearing applications moved by Hussain, reports news agency PTI.Senior Advocate Mohit Mathur, appearing for Hussain, informed the high court that apart from the FIR in the present case, other FIRs have also been registered against the accused by police station Dayalpur. Mathur urged that this bail application be also tagged along with the pleas already pending before Justice Khanna. “Bail pleas under FIR 91/2020 and 92/2020 had gone to Justice Yogesh Khanna and notice was issued for August 6,” Mathur said.The present FIR is related to the alleged commission of offences of rioting and destruction of public property by Hussain in Delhi's Dayalpur area. The other two cases are related to the injuries suffered by two people as a mob pelted stones, threw petrol bombs and fired gunshots from the terrace of Hussain's house. The other is related to the alleged commission of offences of an attempt to murder and rioting and violation of the arms act.The Delhi Police has lodged first information reports (FIRs) against various accused, including Hussain, under sections 147/148/149/436/427/34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 3/4 of the Prevention of Damage To Public Property Act at Dayalpur Police Station.Communal clashes erupted in northeast Delhi on February 24 last year after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters went out of control.

The Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar corridor of the Pink Line spreads across 38 stations.A small portion of east Delhi's Trilokpuri area had turned to be a restriction for the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), due to which the line remained disjointed for some distance there. Now, the opening of the Trilokpuri section between the Mayur Vihar Pocket 1 and Trilokpuri Sanjay Lake stations will entirely link the Pink Line.The Pink Line will also connect important landmarks of the national capital - the Anand Vihar Railway station, Anand Vihar ISBT, Nizamuddin Railway station, markets in South Extension, INA and Lajpat Nagar, officials said, reports news agency PTI.DMRC officials also said there will be a reduction of about 20 minutes of travel time, from HUDA City Centre in Gurgaon to Trilokpuri-Sanjay Lake and vice versa, as after opening of this section, there will be only one interchange station i.e. Delhi Haat-INA instead of two interchange stations as of now."Reduction in fare by ₹20 will be in 38 sections (to and fro) and important key locations like Lajpat Nagar, NOIDA City Centre, Botanical Garden, Mohan Estate to Trilokpuri or vice versa; reduction in fare by ₹10 will be in 524 sections (to and fro)," DMRC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-metro-s-pink-line-segment-to-be-opened-today-101628207344004.html
06-08-2021||Delhi||First half of August likely to be dry: Met department||The first fortnight of August is likely to remain largely dry with experts from the weather office predicting “light to very light” rainfall over the next few days and “break monsoon-like conditions” likely to set in from mid next week.Records from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) show that the first week of August has so far remained dry with most parts of the city receiving trace rainfall.On Thursday, the IMD revised its forecast, saying that light rain and thundershowers are likely over the next three days. Earlier, it had issued an orange alert with heavy rainfall expected in parts of Delhi for August 6.“The forecast was revised as the low-pressure system over Madhya Pradesh started gradually weakening from August 5. There is no intense pressure system that can trigger rainfall. The monsoon trough is expected to shift to the Himalayan foothills by August 10, which will result in break monsoon-like conditions in Delhi and adjoining areas,” said a senior IMD official.Independent forecasters too said Delhi is likely to receive patchy rainfall from August 6-9. “From August 10-11, break monsoon conditions may persist, as the trough is likely to move far to the Himalayan foothills, which means westerly winds will start blowing over Delhi. The break may last for five to six days. Monsoon is expected to revive from August 16-17. Delhi and neighbouring areas may then receive good spells,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of Skymet, a private forecaster.According to weather data available with the IMD, the maximum temperature on Thursday was 35.3°C, a notch above the season’s normal and the minimum was 26.5°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/first-half-of-august-likely-to-be-dry-met-department-101628203271734.html
06-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Meet the blushing trees||Do trees blush like we, humans, do? When the face turns red out of intense shyness? Well, these days some of Delhi’s trees, the pilkhans, are in full blush. Like this one, in Deer Park. The tree is densely leaved—from a distance, its canopy looks like a luxuriant wig. Its green is partly splattered with red, as if a painter had wanted to depict a New York autumn, but had changed course midway.The leaves are in their rusty-red phase.Actually, this colouration happens in a more memorable way earlier in the year. Pilkhan’s aged leaves begin to drop during the end of Delhi winters, by mid-February. New leaves take birth during the first days of March. Their infant shade shows up in dusty purple, changing to red, and then into tints of russets and bronzes. This is when clickbait-greedy Instagrammers become aware of the tree’s existence, and briefly turn the lens of their mobiles to pilkhans.As days pass, the leaves become green. The magic show ends by the middle of April, after which the tree looks beautiful in an ordinary way. The coloured phase is triggered afresh by the monsoon rains. The July-August red is no way comparable to March lush. But this restrained ostentatiousness makes the sight more heartfelt—as if a middle-aged person were trying to relive their youthful prime, when one believed one would never grow old.The pilkhan is spread across the Delhi region, generously sprinkled in Zakir Hussain Marg, Dalhousie Marg, Niti and Nyaya Marg. Sadly, a glorious pilkhan in Jor Bagh market seems to have missed its date with red this rains.In Gurugram, a gorgeous pilkhan stands near the Jama Masjid in Sadar Bazar. A pair draws attention on Golf Course Road, beside a tea shack. Another impressive pilkhan is near the HUDA Gymkhana Club in Sector 4.In Ghaziabad, a pilkhan near Vasundhara Valley Apartments, in Sector 6, Vasundhara, is unevenly smeared in coppery red.To appreciate the blush like a pilkhan connoisseur, all you have to do is bring your gaze from the entire tree to a single leaf. The rusty red reveals itself to be almost pink. The veins that spread across the leaf are watery green. The leaf looks unreal, like a leaf-shaped metal beaten by a dogged blacksmith, until it starts to glow faintly and gets too hot to touch. But this leaf is, of course, cold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-meet-the-blushing-trees-101628202666283.html

The police resorted to the use of force when hundreds of protesting employees demanding regularisation of their jobs marched towards the CM’s house. Nearly 50 protesters were detained, officials said. Earlier, the employees gathered at the PSPCL headquarters with their children and other family members and raised slogans against the corporation for not meeting their demands.Balihar Singh, an employee union leader, said both the state government and the PSPCL management were hell-bent on promoting privatisation in the power utility.“The PSPCL has already threatened the livelihoods of employees by shutting down public thermal plants. Moreover, instead of regularising the services of contractual employees, it is hiring employees through outsourcing,” he said.The protesters claimed that the contractual workers were not paid on ‘equal pay, equal work’ basis and their salaries have not been revised since January 2016.They also asked the corporation to give jobs on compassionate grounds to the families members of those who died on duty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cops-cane-charge-protesting-pspcl-pstcl-contractual-staff-near-cm-s-patiala-residence-101628195395635.html

The court acted on the plea of Puran Singh who had alleged that a fake gram panchayats named Divya Gram was created to siphon off funds granted by the 14th Finance Commission and the local area development funds and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA). The rural development and panchayat also received grant from the board. The department constituted a gram Sabha for a non-existing village and took development grants, advocate Baltej Singh Sidhu told the court, adding that a legal notice was sent to the state for conducting a probe but no action was taken. Sidhu further told the court that the voter list for Divya Gram was prepared in 2018 and subsequently a sarpanch was elected. Information was procured under the Right yo Information (RTI) according to which no electricity connection was running in the name of any person in the village and no transformer was installed as only high-tension connection in the name of the Divya Jyoti Jagriti Sansthan was running, he had told the court. The state government’s counsel informed the court that an inquiry into the entire matter is being held which is likely to be concluded in the near future. Issuing a notice of motion, the bench of Justice Anil Kshetarpal asked the state’s counsel that the inquiry be concluded by the next date of hearing and a report be placed on record on adjourned date of September 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-seeks-report-on-jalandhar-panchayat-with-no-revenue-record-101628195099486.html
06-08-2021||Chandigarh||Akalis plundered Punjab of natural resources, says Navjot Sidhu||Newly appointed Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Thursday accused the previous Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD-BJP) government of plundering Punjab of its natural resources, saying Sukhbir Singh Badal’s 13-point agenda is a new ‘lollipop’ ahead of the assembly elections. Addressing party workers’ meetings in Faridkot and Moga, Sidhu said Punjab needs the “state income agenda” and not false promises. He said, “(SAD chief) Sukhbir Badal should make it clear where would the resources come from to make the agenda a reality. The promises made by the SAD and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to provide free electricity are nothing but a lie. Punjab is a welfare state, but the SAD-BJP government plunged it into a debt of ₹1.5 lakh crore.” He said that the previous government plundered the natural resources of Punjab. “Telangana is earning ₹4,000 crore from mining every year due to their policy. But in their 10-year rule, the SAD-BJP government put only ₹400 crore in the exchequer as sand revenue, which was now being increased by ₹300 crore a year by the Congress regime. I assure you I will increase it to ₹1,000 crore a year. Punjab was dominated by the cable, sand, and transport mafias besides others,” he added.Also, the previous government entered into power pacts keeping their vested interests in mind, the Congress leader said. “Due to these pacts, the state is purchasing electricity at higher rates. I assure you that we will cancel the power purchase agreements (PPAs) and provide electricity to industry at ₹5 per unit and residential units at ₹3 per unit,” he added. Also, the three agriculture laws introduced by the Union government are a clumsy ploy to break the backbone of Punjab’s economy, he said. “The PPAs and three black farm laws would be repealed in the next assembly session. Targeting the AAP, Sidhu said Punjab did not need the Delhi model and that there was no factionalism in the Punjab Congress now. The state Congress chief announced that he would start constituency-wise rallies after August 15. Congress MLAs Harjot Kamal, Sukhjit Singh Kaka Lohgarh, Darshan Singh Brar and MLA Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon were present. State Congress acting president Pawan Goyal accompanied Sidhu. Covid-19 norms were violated during the meetings addressed by Sidhu as more than 1,000 people each had gathered at both the venues. Shown black flags at Moga Farmer unions and contractual employees showed black flags to Sidhu when he arrived in Moga. The farmers also raised slogans against Sidhu for his “the thirsty walks to the well” remark made during his installation ceremony at Chandigarh. The contractual employees protested demanding regularisation of their jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akalis-plundered-punjab-of-natural-resources-says-navjot-sidhu-101628195098270.html
06-08-2021||Chandigarh||Festive mood in four Amritsar villages as Indian hockey team wins Olympic bronze||A festive mood was in the air in four villages of Amritsar districts that have four of their sons in the Indian men’s hockey contingent which defeated Germany to win the bronze medal to end the country’s 41-year wait for an Olympic medal in the national game. The proud families of the players — Shamsher Singh (24) of Attari, Dilpreet Singh (20) of Butala, Gurjant Singh (26) of Khaliara and Harmandeep Singh (26) of Timmowal village — dedicated the win to every Indian. Residents of these villages were seen bursting crackers and distributing sweets. Also, politicians queued up to the players’ houses to congratulate their families. Barring Dilpreet, whose father is a hockey coach who played in the nationals from 1990 to 1996, all three are sons of farmers. Shamsher, a graduate, started playing hockey when he was only 10. “He was inclined towards hockey since his childhood. He used to play on the local ground with other children of the village. His interest in the game increased as he grew up,” said Samsher’s father Hardev Singh said. Shamsher’s mother Harpeet Kaur is a housewife. Gurjant, also a graduate, was inspired by his uncle (mother’s brother) Hardev Singh Chahal who was a hockey player. He started playing hockey when he was studying in class 5. “It was my son’s dream to do something for the country,” said his father Balvir Singh. Gurjant’s mother is a housewife and he has two sisters. Harmandeep’s father Sarabjit Singh, a farmer and a former kabbaddi player, said, “I congratulate all members of the Indian hockey team. My son worked hard and made it to the national team.” Dilpreet, who is pursuing his graduation from a Jalandhar-based private university, was inspired none other than his father Balwinder Singh. “He was nearly 5-year-old when I started training him. He has fulfilled my dream. The entire village is celebrating the win. There is a wedding-like scene at our home,” said Balwinder. Dilpreet’s mother Sukhwant Kaur is also a housewife.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/festive-mood-in-four-amritsar-villages-as-indian-hockey-team-wins-olympic-bronze-101628194917228.html
06-08-2021||Lucknow||Tokyo Olympics: Seeds of India’s success in hockey sown at 2016 Junior World Cup in Lucknow||India’s historic bronze medal win in men’s hockey at the Tokyo Olympics on Thursday seems to have been the result of hard work and planning by many, including former India coach Harendra Singh, whose “junoon” (obsession) guided India to win their maiden Junior Men’s World Cup in Lucknow in 2016.A member of the silver-medal winning Indian team at the 1990 Beijing Asian Games, Harendra, who is now teaching the finer points of the game to the United States team, made a major contribution in building this “new and energetic side”. Eight members of the current squad, including captain Manpreet Singh, were part of the gold-medal winning side in 2016. They were coached by Harendra then.“Many don’t understand my madness and obsession for the game as even in my dreams I care for hockey, but it makes no difference to me. I know that such passion is required to build the future of Indian hockey,”he had said soon after India’s thrilling 2-1 win against Belgium in the Junior World Cup final.Harendra’s comment is still relevant now that India have ended their 41-year-old medal drought at the Olympics. The passion for a podium finish was at its highest among the Indian side though Harendra was removed in 2019 following a disappointing 2018 season.Harendra was given charge of the senior side after India’s medal-less showing at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in 2018, but was unable to change the team’s fortunes. India were also below-par in the 2018 Asian Games in Indonesia, settling for a bronze after going into the tournament as the defending champions. They ended the year with a quarterfinal loss in the World Cup in Bhubaneswar.“...what a incredible journey of these players A big big salute to boys in blue!” one of his tweets on Thursday read.In fact, Singh broke down after watching the historic win and didn’t hide his emotions. “I am so excited that from 10 scorers for India, nine are from the 2016 core group. What more as a coach can I ask for?” Besides Manpreet, players like Harmanpreet Singh, Varun Kumar, Nilakanta Sharma, Sumit, Gurjant Singh, Mandeep Singh and Simranjeet Singh were part of the 2016 World-Cup winning junior squad.He also said India’s investment in junior programmes paid rich dividends. “I salute (chief coach) Graham Reid. I always said invest in youngsters and you will get the medal and he invested in youngsters and today we are on the podium.”Terming the bronze medal win as one of the best moments in Indian hockey, he said the feat will inspire the new generation to pick up hockey sticks. “The journey has just started. It is just an appetizer, the main course is yet to come. It’s just the beginning, many more to come. We need to be patient, give time to players and coaches. It’s a process and needs time to produce results,” he said.Hockey India’s high performance and development committee chairman RP Singh too praised contributions by everyone, including the present and former coaches of both the junior and senior sides, for the team’s bronze-medal win at the Tokyo Olympics.“Be it administrators, selectors, coaches, technical officials and many others, everyone is responsible for India’s success at the Games, and I believe that real process for the better development of Indian hockey was re-started when Hockey India came into existence in 2009,” said RP Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/tokyo-olympics-seeds-of-india-s-success-in-hockey-sown-at-2016-junior-world-cup-in-lucknow-101628194074963.html
06-08-2021||Chandigarh||Apprise court on when all police posts will have CCTV coverage: HC to Haryana||The high court has asked Haryana government to apprise the court by when police posts across the state will be covered under closed-circuit television (CCTV) coverage.The additional chief secretary (home) has been directed to file an affidavit as to by when all entry and exit points of all police posts will be covered by CCTV footage. This court will not expect a long time frame, keeping in view the fact that, to repeat, illegal detention of any person hits at a citizens’ basic fundamental right, the court added.The bench of justice Amol Rattan Singh also directed the additional chief secretary to ensure that instructions be issued that upon any warrant officer being appointed by the court to visit a police station/police post/CIA premises etc., a DDR entry, whether written in a register or allegedly entered online, will be immediately handed over to the visiting warrant officer, failing which, naturally, adverse inference can be taken by the court, that actually no such DDR entry at the relevant time was actually made.The directions were issued in a habeas corpus matter from a Panchkula resident who had alleged that his son was illegally picked up by the police and kept in detention for almost four days even as he was a minor. During the hearing, it had come to light that the police station in question, Sector-14 in Panchkula, had CCTVs but not the police post under this police station. It had also come before court that when court-appointed warrant officer visited the police, the minor boy was found in detention and the warrant officer was not provided the DDR entry of boy’s arrest, which, police claimed, that was made on the day, the warrant officer visited the police station. The court expressed its surprise that the Sector 16 police post was not equipped with CCTV cameras, despite an, affidavit given in a petition about 2 to 3 years ago, that all police stations/CIA staff in the state had been equipped with the CCTV camaras. “Obviously this court not having issued a specific direction that even police posts be so equipped, was taken unnecessary advantage of by the officers of the state, to not install such camaras at police posts, which are equally important as regards determining as to whether somebody had been illegally detained in a police post or not, with that issue ‘hitting’ at the very root of a persons’ right to liberty as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India,” the court observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/apprise-court-on-when-all-police-posts-will-have-cctv-coverage-hc-to-haryana-101628193474939.html

06-08-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana MC to conduct micro survey of door-to-door waste collection||To chalk out a solid waste management plan and stop open dumping of garbage, the municipal corporation (MC) will be conducting a micro survey of door-to-door collection of waste by visiting properties across the city .The decision was taken during a capacity building workshop organised under Swachh Bharat Mission at MC headquarters (Zone-A office) on Wednesday evening. It was conducted by mayor Balkar Sandhu and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal. State project director of Swachh Bharat Mission, Puran Singh, was also present.The survey is being conducted to check whether garbage is being collected from every household/property in the city, so that dumping of waste in open plots and Buddha Nullah can be stopped. MC health branch officials have been directed to complete it in a month. With reference to 2011 census data, MC officials said there were around 3.5 lakh properties in the city at that time and the civic body does not have figures on the present number. During the survey, information regarding the number of houses, shops, labour quarters (vehras), hotels and restaurants will also be gathered and list of garbage collectors working in the informal sector will be prepared. As per officials, the higher authorities are contemplating adoption of Chandigarh model of door-to-door collection by involving informal garbage collectors with MC.Further, the survey staff will list out the number of kitchens in the houses to get a rough idea of the waste generated by the owner and whether waste is being segregated or not. An official, requesting anonymity, said that door-to-door collection of waste is mostly being carried out by the informal sector and many residents do not give waste to them to save monthly fee. The MC has also been facing the heat of National Green Tribunal (NGT) over its failure in taking up solid waste management properly. Puran Singh visited a few areas in the city on Wednesday morning and found gaps.He said that the survey is being done to create a proper system of door-to-door collection in the city. If properties are found, from where the waste is not being collected, then the garbage collectors working in the informal sector will be told to collect from them.MC commissioner Sabharwal said that directions have been issued to complete the survey in a month, following which further steps will be taken for improvement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-mc-to-conduct-micro-survey-of-door-to-door-waste-collection-101628192885331.html

Seeking immediate cancellation of the trust deed, former minister Bikram Singh Majithia demanded the probe into the allotment of the prime land in Balongi area of Mohali to the trust by rural development and panchayats minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa. “It is condemnable that even though the panchayats department had allowed the lease of 10.4 acres for the Bal Gopal Gau Basera society headed by Sidhu ostensibly for running a “gaushala”, it also sanctioned construction of a banquet hall and a diagnostic centre on the same piece of land,” he claimed in a statement. The Akali leader alleged that the entire process smelled of a scam and the government should register a case of cheating against the health minister and members of the Trust as well as officials of the panchayats department responsible for this illegality. Asserting that the SAD would move the court in case the government did not cancel the lease deed, Majithia alleged that due process was not followed in allowing the use of land at a throwaway lease price of ₹25,000 per acre. “This has been done despite the fact that the land is not suitable for establishment of a ‘gaushala’ which villagers felt should be closer to the village,” he added. Majithia also said that the SAD would not allow this takeover of public property for personal profit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-demands-cbi-probe-into-leasing-out-shamlat-land-to-health-minister-s-trust-101628192874877.html

06-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chhabra to get notice from Chandigarh Congress for anti-party utterances||Meeting for the first time after its constitution, the new executive of the faction-riddled Chandigarh Congress, on Thursday, recommended strict action against the rebel party leaders. This will involve a show-cause notice to former city president Pardeep Chhabra for his “anti-party” activities. The party has already written to the high command against him. “The party took a strong note of the recent actions of former Chandigarh Territorial Congress Committee president Pardeep Chhabra, who has been openly criticising the party leadership and thus damaging the party’s image and its prospects. It was unanimously decided to condemn such anti-party activities and issue a show-cause notice to him,” said HS Lucky, chief party spokesperson.Former MP and party’s national treasurer Pawan Kumar Bansal, city party chief Subhash Chawla and the newly appointed office-bearers were present in the meeting. Chhabra, who was also invited by Chawla to the meeting, didn’t attend it citing personal reasons. The notice against Chhabra comes close on the heels of seven party leaders, including a former general secretary, former district general secretaries, presidents and vice-presidents, resigning from the primary membership of the party. Earlier on Thursday, in a message addressed to Chawla, Chhabra stated, “I am fighting to get justice for the loyal party workers. I can expose all the party leaders, but it will harm only the party and the leaders, not their sycophants.” On the notice, he said, “I have not received anything. I will respond to it only after know the contents of the letter. I am a dedicated and loyal worker of the party for over three decades.” Six months on, internal feud rages on For the last six months since Chawla replaced Chhabra as the city president, the party has been struggling to control internal feuds. Targeting Bansal and Chawla, Chhabra has alleged that the incumbent party leadership had ignored party loyalists with more than 30 years’ service. The matter came to a head when the Congress high command recently gave its nod to the appointment of the new executive comprising 133 members. Chhabra alleged that money, power and sycophancy, and not merit, decided the selection of the members. A day after Chhabra’s allegations, his close aide and former general secretary Sandeep Bhardwaj resigned from the party. Bhardwaj blamed Bansal for his resignation. Six more resignations, by those considered loyalists of Chhabra, followed soon after. The allegation has been strongly refuted by Chawla, who has maintained that he has retained nearly 99% of Chhabra’s team in the new committee. The factionalism within the party has erupted amid its preparations for the MC elections later this year, where the party is looking to improve its current tally of five councillors in the MC House of 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chhabra-to-get-notice-from-chandigarh-congress-for-anti-party-utterances-101628192516204.html
06-08-2021||Chandigarh||Languishing hockey infrastructure in Ludhiana impeding budding talent||While the country soaks up the lustre of the men hockey team’s hard-earned bronze medal during the Tokyo Olympics, the local hockey stadium with its slippery turf, overgrown vegetation, and crumbling infrastructure stands in stark contrast and speaks of the authorities’ indifference to the sport. Punjab Agricultural University’s (PAU’s) hockey stadium, which has been named after the “king of short corner” Prithipal Singh, in its present dilapidated state does the legendary Olympian a great disservice as it can no longer facilitate budding hockey players in the region. The AstroTurf, which was recently laid, is slippery at many places, the goalposts are missing in the practice arena and the ground is uneven. The wildly growing vegetation around the stadium gives the venue a rather gloomy look. The stench emanating from the bathrooms have rendered them unfit for use and the main office doubles as a store with gunny bags containing cement stored there. Many windows are broken, adding to the shabbiness of the building. Former hockey coach HS Bhullar said, “The stadium stands as a testimony of sports authorities’ indifference and neglect. We have been urging authorities to repair the stadium for a long time, to no avail.” “Is this the way to treat our national sport?” asks Olympian Hardeep Singh Grewal, while lamenting over the sad state of the hockey stadium stated. “That the talented youth of our country has managed to create history despite the sad state of hockey infrastructure is an absolute miracle,” he said. “We need more coaches and well-maintained infrastructure. Toilet hygiene is a far cry when there is no potable water. We do not give the players any facilities, but expect them to bag medals for the nation. How is this fair?” he asked. Veteran hockey player Jagbir Singh Grewal also shared the same grouse. “For three years, players have been running pillar to post over maintenance of the hockey stadium. However, the Indian hockey teams historic win has given us an opportunity to highlight the sorry state of the hockey infrastructure.” Despite repeated attempts, PAU dean student welfare (DSW) Ravinder Kaur Dhaliwal remained unavailable for comment.District sport officer (DSO) Ravinder Singh, however, says the turf is in good condition. “The hockey academy was closed due to the pandemic. Now, with resumption of classroom teaching, the academy will also be resumed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/languishing-hockey-infrastructure-in-ludhiana-impeding-budding-talent-101628192514936.html

It was listed for hearing before Chief Justice RS Jha and Justice Arun Palli, who adjourned it for final disposal. The court is yet to put out a date for the next hearing.During the hearing on Thursday, the UT had told the court that plea was premature, a submission countered from the petitioner’s side. UT also informed the court that process is on, and it will take another two to three months to pick a company.On Wednesday Kolkata-based industrial and services conglomerate RP-Sanjiv Goenka (RPSG) Group quoted the highest bid for the department and is set to take over the department. It quoted ₹871 crore against the reserve price of ₹175 crore. EED was one of the seven companies in the race for taking over the department.The matter has been taken to the court by UT Powermen Union and the HC stayed the process on two occasions. But the Supreme Court intervened and, on both occasions, stay was vacated. The union is of the view that the administration is selling 100% stake of the government in the absence of such a provision under Section 131 of the Electricity Act, 2003.Another argument of the union is that the department is running into profits and its revenue has been surplus for the past three years, still it is being privatised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-adjourns-hearing-challenging-chandigarh-power-depts-privatisation-101628191975847.html

06-08-2021||Chandigarh||Prashant Kishor quits as Punjab CM’s principal adviser||Amid talk of his likely induction into the Congress at the national level, poll strategist Prashant Kishor on Thursday resigned as Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s principal adviser, saying that he was taking a “temporary break” from active role in public life.The chief minister has accepted Kishor’s resignation.The political strategist’s move, which came just six months before the state assembly polls, is on expected lines. He had announced his retirement from election management on May 2, the day the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress whose election work he was handling scored a resounding victory in West Bengal.In a letter to the chief minister, Kishor said he has not been able to take over the responsibilities as his principal adviser in view of his decision to take a temporary break from active role in public life. “Since I am yet to decide on my future course of action, I write to request you to kindly relieve me from this responsibility. I take this opportunity to thank you for considering me for this position,” he wrote even as political circles in Delhi are abuzz with talk of his induction into the Congress with a senior leadership role.Kishor, or “PK” as he is often called in political circles, had worked with the Congress in Punjab in the 2017 assembly polls with Amarinder as the state unit president, who wanted him to again manage the party’s campaign in next year’s assembly elections. Amarinder, who first spoke to the election consultant about it more than a year ago, inducted him in the chief minister’s office (CMO) as the principal adviser in the rank and status of a cabinet minister on March 1. He was paid a token honorarium of ₹1 per month, but was entitled to a fully-furnished government residence and camp office, executive class travel, official vehicle, medical facilities and secretarial staff as admissible to a cabinet minister.Kishor held meetings with the party’s first-time MLAs and top officials of the state government to gather feedback on the ground realities before getting busy with the West Bengal elections. In May, Kishor announced his retirement from election management work, telling reporters that he had done enough and wanted to quit this space.On his appointment in Punjab, he said, “If you help someone win an election, it is nothing if they offer you principal adviser or adviser’s post. They always like you to be by their side because it suits them. It is for me to decide whether I want to do that or not. I am telling you that I am not doing this work for anybody anymore.” Though his statement signalled his disinterest in continuing in the principal adviser’s position, he took time to send his resignation.The poll strategist was seen as the brain behind the “Coffee with Captain” and “Punjab da Captain” that had worked well for the party and the CM-face in 2017. “PK & his team and their work were absolutely critical to our victory in Punjab!” Amarinder had tweeted after the party’s victory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/prashant-kishor-quits-as-punjab-cm-s-principal-adviser-says-taking-temporary-break-101628191794731.html

They couldn’t sleep properly till the start of the match for the bronze medal at the Oi Hockey Stadium on Thursday morning. There were altogether different scenes at Lalit’s home at the Shivpur bypass in Varanasi and coach Mishra’s house in Sarnath, located 10 km northeast of Varanasi.People from Lalit’s village gathered at his house to watch the match live with his parents and his elder brother, whereas Mishra chose to watch it alone as he didn’t want to be disturbed. “I watched the match all alone as I didn’t want any disturbance. I even kept my family out of my room during the 60-minute clash. I couldn’t pick my phone for a few minutes even after India’s win as it was an emotional moment for me. I couldn’t believe that my trainee Lalit kept his promise of a medal to me,” said Mishra who trained Lalit at the Udai Pratap College in Varanasi under the Sports Authority of India’s scheme.“This means a lot to me as well as to Varanasi, which has produced some great hockey players for India in the past like Mohd Shahid and Vivek Singh. India’s success in hockey at the Tokyo Games is a great gift to Varanasi and it’s a special occasion to celebrate in the month of Sawan as we all worship Lord Shiva,” said Mishra, adding, “Lalit was one of the amazing kids we had in the lot of 10-11 boys under training. He (Lalit) never disobeyed my orders on the ground and was always disciplined.”“I never found him missing his training sessions. His ability to bounce back, especially when he was trapped in a selection controversy, helped him a lot. Lalit’s achievement will help attract many more Varanasi kids to hockey in the near future,” said Mishra, 62.Lalit’s father Satish, 61, too sounded emotional on his son’s success. “I told him to stay focused even after India lost to Belgium in the semi-final. It was heartbreaking for all of us but I kept my cool and didn’t let my son know my emotions,” said the senior Upadhyay, still a private employee of a nationalised bank in Varanasi.“We celebrated all the goals scored by India today and my heart was almost in my mouth when Germany got a penalty corner in the last few seconds of the game. I still feel the goosebumps as controlling emotions at that time was quite difficult,” he said.In Tokyo, the situation was no different for Lalit who was watching the match while sitting in the stands of the Oi Hockey Stadium after being injured in the previous match.“It’s an emotional moment... can’t understand what to say (after a pause). The way we played today was unique. It’s a moment to celebrate, congratulate everyone,” said Lalit on Thursday. “I came to Tokyo with Baba Bholenath’s blessings, and was sure of winning a medal here as I had (made) this promise to my family and my coach in Varanasi. In today’s game, our strong defence stopped the Germans. The last four minutes were heart-stopping as the opponents were scoring penalty corners one after the other. My heart came to a standstill for a while when Germany got a penalty corner in the last six seconds, but Anna (PR Sreejesh) stood like a rock at the goalpost and defended us.” “This medal will act as a tonic for Indian hockey. After a long gap, this medal has increased our stature at the international level. The popularity of hockey will increase once again . A plan should be made to take this game to the villages.”(With inputs from Sudhir Kumar in Varanasi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/varanasis-lalit-keeps-his-promise-as-india-win-bronze-in-men-s-hockey-at-tokyo-olympics-101628191675983.html

06-08-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana proposes to exempt development projects from social impact assessment||The Haryana cabinet on Tuesday gave its nod for amendments in the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, a central law. An amendment Bill will be tabled in the assembly and when passed, will require the assent of the President. An official spokesperson said the amendments have been proposed to ensure that infrastructure projects get completed and do not suffer. The proposed amendments, the spokesperson said, aimed to create a fine balance between the goals of development and rights of the individuals. Thus, it has been proposed to amend some provisions and insert new provisions in the central law, keeping in mind the state- specific circumstances. The proposed amendments The cabinet approved that Section 2 of the Act be amended and a new Section 10A be inserted to exempt certain development projects, rural infrastructure, affordable housing, industrial corridors, health and education and urban metro rail projects from the ambit of social impact assessment study and provision to safeguard food security. A new Section 23-A is proposed to be inserted in case there is an agreement in writing with the persons interested and making an award. Besides this, it is proposed to insert Section 31-A, pertaining to payment of lump sum amount in lieu of rehabilitation and resettlement costs for projects linear in nature, with a lump sum amount of 50% of compensation determined to the affected family. Further, to facilitate urgent acquisition of land in certain cases, under Section 40 of the principal Act, it is proposed to substitute the words “approval of Parliament”, with “the direction given by the state legislature to the state government”. The proposed legislation intends to simplify and speed up the acquisition of land in larger public interest. The amendments proposed are broadly in tune with the amendments carried out by Gujarat in 2016. The spokesperson said serious land acquisition issues were being faced by the state government in completing the existing essential infrastructure projects. These included projects vital to national security, rural infrastructure, including electrification affordable housing and housing for poor people. Industrial corridors where the land may be acquired up to two kilometres on both sides of designated railway lines or roads for such industrial corridor, infrastructure projects such as health, education and projects under public private partnership where the ownership of land continues to vest with the state government and urban metro rail and rapid rail projects were also facing land acquisition impediments. Creation of HR dept under chief secretaryThe cabinet also approved the creation of Human Resources (HR) department under the chief secretary. An official spokesperson said the HR department has been created to ensure that standards and norms laid by it are followed in the recruitment, regulation of service conditions, posting or transfers, deputation. It would also ensure a unified administrative control over all the employees of Group A, B, C & D, including Haryana Civil Services (HCS), to ensure maintenance of common cadres through a single department and maintenance of integrity of the public services and eradication of corruption. The spokesperson said it will also ensure transparency in recruitment through Common Eligibility Test. Amendment in HCS (executive branch) rulesThe cabinet also approved amendment in Haryana Civil Service (Executive Branch) Rules, 2008. An official spokesperson said as per the amendment, there are only two levels to pass the departmental examinations- with credit (75% marks) and pass (50% marks). Thus, there is no level of higher standard to pass the departmental examination for extra assistant commissioners. Affordable housing schemesThe Cabinet accorded approval to five affordable rental housing policies. These are policy for planned development of retirement housing, affordable rental housing, policy for planned development of student rental housing, policy for planned development of medico assisted living facilities and policy for planned development of working women’s hostel. An official spokesperson said these policies have been formulated through grant of change of land use (CLU) permission under Haryana Scheduled Roads and Controlled Areas Restriction of Unregulated Act, 1963 and through the grant of license under Act Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975. Remission of stamp duty on agri landIn a bid to reduce the financial burden on farmers in transactions in respect of exchange of cultivable agriculture land, the cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal for consideration of remission of stamp duty. As per the cabinet decision, only a nominal duty at the rate of ₹5,000 per deed of registration will be chargeable under Article 31 of Schedule 1-A of the Indian Stamp Act. Amendment in teacher transfer policyThe cabinet gave a major relief to the teachers, clerks, assistants and lab attendants suffering from various disabilities by amending 2016 teacher transfer policy. An official spokesperson said the amendment would ensure equitable, demand-based deployment of teachers in a fair and transparent manner. Service extension in view of pandemic The cabinet on Thursday gave ex-post facto approval to a proposal to grant one-month extension in service to employees of four departments who were going to retire on April 30. The extension was given emergent situation arising out of pandemic. The cabinet on Thursday approved creation of land bank for departments, boards and corporations. Land bank for government departmentsAn official spokesperson said a policy for creating land bank for the government departments for development projects would entail constitution of three committees - land and rate scrutiny committee, land bank committee and a high-powered land bank committee. The state government has been experiencing difficulties in making land available to the various departments in providing land for essential services that is waterworks, power sub-stations, colleges and other specialised institutions of higher learning including universities, medical colleges and other hospitals and polytechnics etc. The unutilised land of various departments, boards and corporations shall be clubbed at one place under the Revenue department. An official spokesperson said as per the policy, the farmers can also submit a proposal to the government for buying land and can also advise the government for selecting a particular site for the development project. CRID nodal dept for marriage registrationThe cabinet approved a proposal regarding transferring of the administration of the Haryana Compulsory Marriage Registration Act, 2008, to Citizen Resources Information Department (CRID). An official spokesperson said CRID is the nodal department for handling of all citizen resources information. Since marriage constituted a key element of the family structure information, it has been decided that the nodal department for the administration of the Haryana Compulsory Registration of Marriages Act, 2008 be CRID. This is being done by making amendments in the Business of the Haryana Government (Allocation) Rules, 1974. Hisar Airport rechristened as Maharaja Agrasen AirportThe cabinet accorded approval for designating the existing Hisar Airport as Maharaja Agrasen Airport, Hisar. An official spokesperson said phase-I of the project has already been completed with the procurement of aerodrome license for the airport in 2018-19 and the start of the flight operation from Hisar Airport under RCS UDAN scheme. Under Phase-11 of the project, work on extension of the airstrip from its existing length of 4,000 feet to 10,000 feet is already being undertaken. Revision of vehicles’ ageThe cabinet granted approval for amendment in the Haryana Motor Vehicles Rules, 1993, revising the age of operation of various types of transport vehicles under different permits in the state. This is in line with the Supreme Court orders which said the operation of diesel and petrol- driven vehicles which have attained the age of 10 and 15 respectively has been prohibited in the national capital region (NCR). Further, with the introduction of clean fuel technologies like electric vehicles, LNG, CNG, a need was felt to amend the rules to provide for enhanced age for such vehicles. An official spokesperson said this amendment will also remove an anomaly by fixing the age of stage carriage buses at par with private service vehicles and education institutional vehicles. This has been a long-pending demand of the stage carriage permit holders and will augment the transport services being provided by Haryana roadways as well as private operators, in addition to bringing savings to the public exchequer. The age of vehicles with tourist permits remains unchanged in line with rule 82 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-proposes-to-exempt-development-projects-from-social-impact-assessment-101628191434808.html
06-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Housing Board rakes in ₹9.8 crore from sale of 12 freehold flats||The auction of 12 freehold residential units fetched the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) ₹9.8 crore on Thursday. Three of these flats went for more than ₹1 crore each. A three-bedroom flat in Sector 63 was sold for ₹1.07 crore against a reserve price of ₹1 crore. An MIG flat in Sector 51, with a reserve price of ₹90 lakh, brought in ₹1.07 crore. In Sector 49, a two-bedroom flat earned ₹1.01 crore against the reserve price of ₹1 crore. The other nine flats raked in anywhere between ₹24.65 lakh and ₹95.63 lakh (see box). “Even after considerable increase in the reserve price of some of the dwelling units, CHB received bids nearly 6.5% above the reserve price. However, if the highest bid amount is compared with the reserve prices as per the earlier e-tenders, then the board has received 17.59% above the previous reserve prices,” said Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, CHB. The board had invited e-tenders for the sale of 46 built-up dwelling units on freehold basis. Among these, 12 units were included for the first time, while the rest were those that could not be sold in the last three auctions. The units were available in Sectors 38 (West), 49, 51 and 63. The last date for submission of e-bids was August 4 and the bids were opened on Thursday. A total of 30 e-bids were received for the 12 dwelling units sold.Properties worth ₹71 crore sold in last four months In December 2019, CHB had offered 212 properties, but found no taker due to high reserve prices. This year, during the pandemic, the board decreased the reserve price to attract more buyers. After getting good response to its auction, it increased the reserve price of several freehold properties and held more auctions. Notably, while a major chunk of its freehold residential properties have been sold off, it has not received great response to its leasehold properties – both commercial and residential. During the last four months, the board has conducted four e-auctions for 121 freehold residential properties and 87 properties have been auctioned for ₹70.59 crore.On the contrary, only nine commercial leasehold properties have been sold for ₹4.73 crore and two leasehold residential units for ₹1.74 crore.Garg said a number of initiatives helped CHB turn around its fortunes in the auctions this year, compared to those held in 2019. “Cleaning and repair of units, personal inspection of the premises, change of mode of disposal from e-auction to e-tender, helpdesk to assist in submission of e-bids, answers to queries and reaching to the public through various modes of mass communication seem to have elicited better response this time around,” said Garg. Kamal Gupta, president, Chandigarh Property Consultants’ Association, said, “In 2019 there was recession in the property market. But now, as substantiated by CHB auctions, there is an upswing in city’s realty sector.” Properties still up for grabsBids can be placed for 151 commercial units and 38 residential units, all leasehold, till 10am on August 10. The unsuccessful bidders of Thursday’s e-tender may participate in these e-tenders. However, for the remaining 34 freehold residential units the next e-tender may be invited after a fortnight. E-bid submission can be made on www.etenders.chd.nic.in. Every bidder is required to get registered on the portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-housing-board-rakes-in-9-8-crore-from-sale-of-12-freehold-flats-101628191375843.html

06-08-2021||Other||Prayagraj Municipal Corporation in UP floats tender to check stray dog menace||To check stray dog menace in the city, Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) has floated a tender for sterilisation of stray dogs. Following which, the population of stray dogs would come down steadily in the city and so would be the nuisance caused by them, claim officials. The idea of sterilising the stray dogs in the city has been taken up after over a decade. The responsibility to do this would rest with the private agency which gets selected after the bidding, they added. The livestock department of the PMC has floated the tender for the deployment of the agency. The purpose of sterilisation is to stop increasing number of stray dogs in the city which as per some approximation has surpassed 20,000, said officials. As per the plan of the PMC, dangerous dogs in each locality of the city would be identified and sterilized by the agency. The corporators of each of 80 wards of the city would help in identifying such dogs in their respective wards which often run behind vehicles and bite people. Numerous accidents have happened in different localities of the city wherein people have fallen from their bikes or cycles after being chased by the stray dogs, claim officials. To execute the work, the agency would capture the dog with utmost care so that the dog is not hurt in the process. Once captured, the dog would be sterilised and would be looked after for a couple of days to ensure that he has healed. The dogs will then be released in the same locality, the officials explained. Public relation officer of PMC, PK Mishra said, “Before giving the work to the agency, every aspect will be examined which are necessary for sterilisation of the dogs while taking proper care of the dogs”. PMC would carefully look into the credentials of the agency especially in terms of professionalism, he added. Over a decade ago, the exercise to control the increasing numbers of stray dogs was taken up and dozens of stray dogs were sterilised with the help of an organisation. However, after the death of some of the dogs after sterilisation, various animal rights and other organisations had protested, and the process was stopped midway.

06-08-2021||Chandigarh||With 3rd wave looming, Ludhiana gets 10 new O2 plants||With the spectre of a third wave looming large and haunting images of patients gasping for rapidly running out oxygen still fresh in memory, the district administration is doing its best to get ahead of another potential Covid crisis, while the cases are still in control. Thanks to the concerted efforts of industries, district authorities and non-governmental organisations, hospitals and health centres across Ludhiana have received 10 new oxygen plants, which will boost the medical health infrastructure of the state. An oxygen plant with a capacity of 1,000 LPM (litres per minute) is being installed at the ESI Hospital and will cost ₹1.7 crore. This oxygen plant, which is nearing completion, has been funded by HITES (HLL Infra Tech Services Ltd) under the ministry of health and family welfare. A 1,000 LPM oxygen plant has been installed at the Ludhiana Civil Hospital by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) under PM-Cares Fund in collaboration with the state government, while the state government has installed another 700-LPM capacity plant. Ludhiana deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said, “Now, hospitals will be able to generate on-site medical oxygen in a cost-effective manner rather than sourcing it from other places. Raikot sub-divisional magistrate Himanshu Gupta, who is also the nodal officer for the project, said oxygen generation plants have been installed using medical oxygen plant (MOP) technology, which can produce a 93% concentration, that can be directly supplied to hospital beds or be used to fill medical oxygen cylinders. “All these 10 plants, which include six in Ludhiana city, have been set up in the last two months. There can be no question of oxygen shortage now in case of an emergency,” he said. Private groups under their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) have also contributed oxygen plants. A plant of 250 LPM capacity, which cost ₹70 lakh, has been installed by Nabha Power at the Sub-Divisional Hospital (SDH), Raikot. At the Urban Health Centre, Jawaddi, the ADAMA group in collaboration with the Punjab government has also set up an oxygen generation plant of 165 LPM capacity that cost ₹65 lakh under the CSR initiative. At SDH, Khanna, ICICI bank in collaboration with the state has set up a plant of 300-LPM capacity, which cost 70 lakhs. Similarly, ACT (an NGO) pitched in for an oxygen plant of 500 LPM capacity at Sant Baba Isher Singh Memorial Hospital, Rara Sahib, which cost ₹65 lakh. The NGO also donated a 500 LPM capacity plant at GTB Hospital, which cost ₹50 lakh. At CMC Hospital, Ludhiana, an oxygen generation plant of 500 LPM capacity that cost ₹1.2 crore is being set up by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and CMC Hospital. The project is expected to be completed by October this year. An oxygen plant of 500-LPM capacity has already been completed at Urban Health Centre, Vardhman. “The deadly Covid surge has put enormous pressure on healthcare facilities in India. For those suffering from severe Covid symptoms, getting oxygen support well in time can save their lives,” said the deputy commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/with-3rd-wave-looming-ludhiana-gets-10-new-o2-plants-101628189395496.html
06-08-2021||Other||Ganga, Yamuna in spate, river water enters Bade Hanuman temple in Prayagraj||Thousands gathered at the Bade Hanumanji temple at Sangam area to watch the annual ritual of Ganga waters entering the temple premises on Thursday. This happens each year due to increase in river water levels and on Thursday the nearly 2-meter rise in Ganga and Yamuna levels over the past 24 hours led to familiar flooding of the temple as Ganga water submerged the temple. Devotees who consider this as an auspicious event and who had gathered in large numbers, started chanting slogans in praise of the Gods and the Ganga river. Head priest of the Bade Hanumanji temple, Mahant Narendra Giri, said, “We performed Ganga Aarti followed by “Abhishek” (a religious ritual) of both mother Ganga and lord Hanuman. After this, we took a small idol of Hanuman and touched it with larger idol and then placed it above the temple. Now, till the flood water recedes, all daily religious rituals would be performed before this small idol.” Meanwhile, the release of water from the Dholpur barrage from Chambal river in Rajasthan is likely to further worsen the flood situation in the Sangam city as the water released from Dholpur barrage is expected to enter Prayagraj by Saturday. The Ganga water levels at Phaphamau have increased by 1.77 meters since Wednesday, 4 pm and stood at 81.96mts on Thursday. At Chhatnag, the river water levels increased by 1.84mts and were recorded at 81.20mts on Thursday’s 4 pm. Officials said the Yamuna river level had increased by around 2 meters in the past 24 hours. Water level of Yamuna, (as recorded at Naini), was 81.74mts whereas it was 79.79mts at 4pm on Wednesday. An alert has been issued as administration fears that the water level of Ganga-Yamuna could be higher than in 2019 when both the rivers had crossed 85 meters. Divisional Commissioner Sanjay Goyal has ordered the officials of the district administration to remain vigilant. ADM MP Singh said that the NDRF team will be deployed in the coastal areas of both the rivers from August 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ganga-yamuna-in-spate-river-water-enters-bade-hanuman-temple-in-prayagraj-101628189274892.html
06-08-2021||Bhopal||Over 30,000 people stranded in MP floods rescued in 5 days: Official||BHOPAL: More than 1,100 people were rescued on Thursday from flood-affected villages of Madhya Pradesh, a home department official said.As many as 25 villages have been submerged fully while 68 were partially underwater due to the release of water from the Kota barrage in the Chambal river on Thursday. The situation is still tense in the Chambal division as the river is still flowing five metres above of danger mark, the official said.More than 70 teams of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Indian Army and Indian Air Force helicopters are carrying out rescue operations for the past three days. In the past five days, more than 55,000 people living in 493 villages of Gwalior, Sheopur, Shivpuri, Bhind and Morena have been affected. More than 31,000 people have been rescued and as many as 16,000 shifted to 126 relief camps in Gwalior and Chambal division.But there are many still living in submerged villages; some of them sent SOS messages on social media. Priyanka Goyal, who said she was a resident of Madwari village of Bhind, posted a video on her Facebook account seeking help for 300 villagers who were stranded. After the video, a rescue team successfully shifted all the villagers to the relief camp.In another incident, two villagers of Kundarayan village of Gwalior saved the lives of 27 people, who were stuck in the village for the past 36 hours. The villagers, Chhotelal Singh and Guddu Kumar swam 200 metres to inform authorities about those stranded.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan who inspected the flood-affected areas and announced clothes and 50 kg ration to every affected family.“The revenue department is evaluating the loss of property and the agriculture department has been asked to evaluate the loss of crop and animal husbandry department of livestock in every district,” said Chouhan.The opposition said not enough was being done. Congress MLA Lakhan Singh protested in front of Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Bhitarwar, one of the flood-affected areas in Gwalior. Chouhan told him this wasn’t the time or place for politics. “Come to the assembly for politics. This is not the right place to do politics,” said Chouhan. Lakhan Singh did wrap up but not before responding to the barb. “People are facing problems and officers are not doing anything for them. I sat on a protest to support the locals, not to do any politics.” BJP lawmaker Rameshwar Sharma blamed the Congress for the flood, saying the floods happened in the Chambal region because the Congress government didn’t act on the river interlinking project floated by former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.”Congress MLA Kunal Chaudhary, however, asked why he was absolving his party’s government at the Centre. “For the past six years, BJP is in power so why did they delay the project. BJP leaders have made it a habit to blame the Congress for everything... and now for a natural calamity and mismanagement of state government too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/over-30-000-people-stranded-in-mp-floods-rescued-in-5-daysofficial-101628189154620.html
06-08-2021||Delhi||Dalit girl’s alleged rape, murder: Suspects may be asked to take polygraph test||A day after the investigation into the alleged rape and murder of a minor Dalit girl at a southwest Delhi crematorium was transferred to crime branch, the new team on Thursday visited the crime scene at Purani Nangal village and said that they will seek the remand of the four arrested suspects to question them and get their consent to undergo a polygraph test.Investigators on Friday said the suspects will be confronted with the evidence collected so far, and the allegations that the victim’s family members and villagers have made.“The arrested men can either agree to take the lie-detector test or refuse it. The refusal is generally considered a ploy that the suspect is using to avoid telling the truth. We will have to wait and see what the four arrested men in this case opt for. As far as the investigation is concerned, we are depending on the DNA profiling of the arrested persons and other scientific evidence collected or is being collected in the case,” said a senior crime branch officer, who asked not to be named.A polygraph or a lie detector test is a procedure to record physiological indicators like blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity while a person is asked a series of questions.On Sunday around 5.30 pm, the nine-year-old girl went to fetch water from a water cooler installed inside the crematorium. Half an hour later, the 55-year-old priest, Radhe Shyam and the three others, Mohammad Salim,55, Laxmi Narayan,49, and Kuldeep,63 called the girl’s mother and showed her the child’s body. Though the accused said the girl died of electrocution while fetching water from the cooler, her family alleged that the suspects hurriedly cremated the body after frightening the family off from informing the police about her death.According to the police, when the girl’s parents informed the villagers, they rushed to the crematorium, doused the pyre and removed charred remains of the child’s body, before allegedly assaulting the four men and handing them over to the police.Since the girl’s clothes that she was wearing at the time of the crime were burnt along with her body during the cremation, the police only have her charred remains for investigation. The three-doctor board that conducted an autopsy on the charred remains of the child has informally told the police that they cannot reach any conclusion by examining the remains, senior police officers said.On Thursday, the crime branch team visited the crematorium along with forensic experts and collected fresh evidence. The local police with the help of forensic experts have already collected the undergarments of the arrested persons, lifted fingerprints, and other necessary evidence from the crematorium. The water cooler was also seized for examination.“The electrical experts are examining the cooler to ascertain if electric current was leaking through it, or if there was a technical fault. However, it will be difficult to establish that the girl was electrocuted to death after coming into contact with the appliance,” the officer added.Protest continuesLate on Wednesday night, the police cleared one carriageway of the Pankha Road, where the girl’s family members, villagers, and political activists have been protesting since Sunday night, demanding speedy justice for the girl, and death penalty for the four suspects, who were arrested and sent to jail on Monday.Vehicular movement was restored on one carriageway going towards Janakpuri from Delhi cantonment, while the opposite carriageway has been occupied by the protesters, right outside the main entrance of Purani Nangal village, where the victim’s family lives in a rented room.According to the police, the protesters agreed to clear one carriageway after the Indian Army establishment at Delhi cantonment served a notice to the organiser of the agitation as well as the local police, asking them to vacate the area citing security concerns and inconvenience caused to the military personnel and vehicles in the run-up to their preparedness for the Independence Day.On Thursday, Asha Devi, mother of the December 16,2012 gang rape case victim, also visited the protest site and met the child’s mother.“Having gone through a similar tragedy in my life, I could feel the pain that the child’s mother is going through. That’s the reason I went there and spoke to the mother in detail about the crime. I stand in solidarity with the victim’s family members and will extend my support in their fight in whatever way possible,” said Devi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dalit-girl-s-alleged-rape-and-murder-suspects-may-be-asked-to-take-polygraph-test-101628189094628.html

He also said the government is considering various options over resuming local train travel for the general public. This was against the backdrop of Maharashtra on Thursday recording 6,695 new cases, along with 120 deaths, taking the total number of cases to 6,336,220.Thackeray said that all decisions will be made with the intention to safeguard people’s lives due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Thackeray stressed that the Covid-19 situation across the state has not fully improved as some districts are still showing large number of cases.Speaking at the inauguration of a municipal ward office in Bandra, Thackeray said, “The lockdown isn’t permanent. When will the local [trains] start? We are considering the options. Like we have given relaxation for shops and establishments, other districts will also get them. But we will keep our responsibilities [towards people] in mind and then provide the relaxations.” Thackeray said that he could address the state through social media on these issues soon.The demand to allow general people, who are fully vaccinated to use Mumbai suburban train services, have been coming from citizens, passenger organisations, political parties. However, the state has not issued any order regarding it. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), in its order on August 2, did not make any mention of reopening train services for all.The state government in its order issued on August 2 has not given relaxation in curbs in 11 districts, including Pune, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, Solapur, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Ahmednagar, Beed, Raigad and Palghar, as the weekly growth rate and positivity rate in these districts is higher than the state’s overall average.Locals, including traders, hoteliers, shop-owners, among others in Pune, Palghar, Kolhapur, among other districts have been defying the state’s orders and keeping their shops open beyond the permitted operational hours. They held protests, demanding further relaxations on the lines of other districts.Thackeray said, “Wherever we could provide relaxations we have given, but where we could not, it was out of no choice.” He further added, “I appeal to the people and traders where we have not able to ease the curbs to keep their restraint. It is not that wherever relaxations are given, they are dear to us and others are not. We have to make these decisions, keeping the lives of people in mind.”Mumbai on Saturday recorded 327 new cases with nine deaths, with its toll reaching 15,929.There were 217,905 tests done on Thursday, while the number of recoveries clocked 7,120.The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 74,995, while the total number of deaths right from the Covid-19 outbreak has now reached 133,530.There are currently 74,995 active patients across the state, of which Pune tops with 14,974 patients, followed by Sangli with 7,863 active patients and Satara with 7,516.The death toll has now reached 133,530 with Pune leading with 18,580 deaths, followed by Mumbai with 15,929 and Thane with 11,066.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-curbs-maharashtra-mulls-options-for-local-trains-for-all-cm-uddhav-thackeray-appeals-for-restraint-101628189034555.html
06-08-2021||Delhi||Sports University should be built visualising a sportsperson’s life: Sisodia||Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday reviewed the construction of the upcoming Sports University in the capital and instructed officials to build it after visualising the day-to-day life of a sportsperson so that they can “relish their training” at the varsity.Outlining the priorities for the construction of the campus, Sisodia said, “The university should be constructed keeping in mind the daily life routine of 10 top sportspersons of the world. For sportspersons, the stadium is their world and they thoroughly relish the training facilities that will enhance their performance. They lead a highly disciplined ascetic life. Such a routine is essential for any sportsperson to win medals at the highest levels of competition, including the Olympics.”“Our objective is to create a university which can make the nation proud by producing medal-winning athletes, by providing advanced training facilities and sports infrastructure,” he said.The state cabinet in October 2019 approved the setting up of the university in outer Delhi’s Mundka. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said the university will offer field-specific degrees that will be on a par with those offered in other courses at the graduate, postgraduate and doctoral levels.The government in the same month allocated the university a 90 acres plot in Mundka. However, construction work was disrupted by the pandemic and has not started yet. Weightlifting champion Karnam Malleswari was named the varsity vice-chancellor on June 24.The Delhi Sports University is expected to start admitting students from class 6 onwards beginning April next year. HT last month reported that due to a delay in construction of the campus in Mundka, the Sports University will begin its operations from a government school building and sports complex in Civil Lines.Delhi public works minister Satyendra Jain, who also attended the review meeting on Thursday, said, “The Delhi Sports University will be a world-class institution on a par with other world-class sports universities. It will leave no stone unturned in accomplishing this feat. The university will be equipped with the latest technology and equipment for enhancing the performance and overall well-being of athletes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sports-university-should-be-built-visualising-a-sportsperson-s-life-sisodia-101628188975429.html
06-08-2021||Delhi||HC seeks response from LG, Delhi govt on panel probing O2 deaths||The Delhi high court on Thursday sought the response of the Lieutenant Governor (LG) and the city government on a plea seeking to operationalise the six-member high powered committee to probe into deaths caused by oxygen shortage.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh issued notice to the authorities on the plea by Riti Singh Verma, whose 34-year-old husband died of Covid-19 at a private hospital on May 14, seeking that all Covid-19 deaths be probed by the expert committee, the functioning of which was stayed by the L-G.Verma, through senior advocate Manish Vashisht, contended that the death summary of her husband issued by the hospital is “doubtful”.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, said the executive took a decision and constituted the committee on May 27. However, the order was stayed by the LG citing that the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.In her plea, the woman claimed her husband was admitted in a not very severe condition and was a healthy 34-year-old with no comorbidities, who died due to a cardiac arrest as per the discharge summary.“The discharge summary appears to be copy paste job on the part of the hospital as the deceased was a male and referred as lady. In the manner in which the petitioner’s husband’s case was handled casts a doubt on the hospital dealing with the Covid -19 patients and also the death summary not mentioning if the oxygen was administered at any point of time when the condition started deteriorating,” the plea said.It contended that her husband’s death is a fit case to be probed by the high powered committee. She pleaded that she has two small children to look after along with the parents and the untimely death of her husband has caused great financial hardship.The court, while granting time to the city government to file its response, asked it to see whether ₹50,000 ex-gratia--the government promised to family members of those people who died of Covid-19--could be given to the woman, whose husband, the only earning member in the family, died at a young age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-seeks-response-from-lg-delhi-govt-on-panel-probing-o2-deaths-101628188973950.html
06-08-2021||Delhi||SDMC seeks fresh report on number of registered mobile towers||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Thursday asked its officials to submit a fresh report on the number of towers registered with the civic body by August 31. Also, he asked officials to recover pending dues from telecom operators, civic officials said.According to municipal officials, these directions were issued in a special House meeting called to deliberate on the issues related to installation of mobile towers under the jurisdiction of the SDMC.SDMC Mayor Mukesh Suryan said that he has asked officials to prepare a fresh report so that all councillors know how many towers are registered in their particular ward. “This will help us keep a regular check on the towers registered and the status of fee collected as well as on the fact if they have followed the norms,” said Suryan.As per the last available report, there are a total of 5189 towers, of which 3995 are registered, 1194 are in the process of completing formalities while 281 are sealed.SDMC officials said that the exercise will not only regulate installation and operation of mobile towers in the jurisdiction of the south corporation but also boost municipality’s revenue.“There are many mobile operators, which have not paid the dues over the years. The officials have been asked the collect the dues with penalties, “ said Suryan.The special House where fraternity from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) was also invited was convened to discuss the issue of radiation from towers and how to address such complaints from residential areas.The mayor said that Thursday’s deliberations also included suggestions from Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) and other social groups about issues concerning radiation emerging from mobile towers and mushrooming of illegal mobile towers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sdmc-seeks-fresh-report-on-number-of-registered-mobile-towers-101628188914518.html
06-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi working to set up over 37k Covid-19 beds for next wave of infections: Jain||The national capital will have over 37,000 dedicated beds in hospitals, makeshift facilities, and Covid Care Centres (CCC) for Covid-19 patients in the event of another wave of the infection, state health minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday, as he outlined the Delhi government’s plans to scuttle any further outbreak of the disease, and warned that the city will be put under lockdown if the test positivity rate crosses 5%.Speaking at a virtual discussion organised by ASSOCHAM on preparations for the third wave of the infection — which would be Delhi’s fifth, Jain said the state is conducting 75,000 Covid-19 tests a day and ‘aggressively’ tracing contacts to keep another outbreak at bay.“All measures necessary are being taken, and health infrastructure is being ramped up to unprecedented levels, with more than 37,000 dedicated beds being built for the fight against Covid-19,” said Jain. Makeshift hospitals have been set up in Chhattarpur, Sant Nirankari Colony, and Ram Leela Maidan, which will add more than 1,200 intensive care unit beds, with and without ventilators.In documents submitted to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal in the third week of June, officials of the Delhi government reassessed their projections for potential infections during the next possible wave of Covid-19, and divided the outbreak into two scenarios —between 37,000 and 45,000 new infections in the city every day.Since then, the state government has also outlined a colour-coded graded response action plan, which sets clear thresholds for curbs that kick in from a test positivity rate as low as 0.5% in order to thwart an outbreak.The plan harks back to a similar mechanism to fight air pollution during pre-winter months and classifies outbreak severity into four bands – yellow, amber, orange and red – with each representing a more severe outbreak and, thus, stricter curbs than the one preceding it.The government is also taking measures to ensure that there is no shortfall in oxygen, and said the state is building and supporting infrastructure such as pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and other oxygen plants in Delhi hospitals, Jain said during the discussion on Thursday.He said that the Delhi government is providing subsidies to build oxygen plants and facilities to store liquid medicine oxygen.Speaking about the second wave, he said, “We were caught off guard because of oxygen shortages and logistical issues of procuring it. But now, over 50 oxygen plants have already been built and more are coming up so that such a problem doesn’t rise again.”He said, “In Delhi, 75,000 tests are still being carried out every day and aggressive contact tracing is still on to ensure that the situation remains under control. We have made public what our response will be. If the positivity rate now goes up to 5%, then we will go for an immediate lockdown without delay,” said Jain.To be sure, the test positivity rate in Delhi has been below 5% for 77 days, going back to May 20, when the city’s fourth wave of infections began to ebb, and cases began to fall.Experts regard the test positivity as an essential statistic to gauge the spread of an infection in a region, and the trajectory of this number can indicate if cases will rise or fall in the future.“Cases are increasing again in the United States, so we must not drop our guard at this point. All possible efforts are being made to ensure that a third wave doesn’t come and if at all it comes, we are to be prepared for the worst,” Jain added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-working-to-set-up-over-37k-covid-19-beds-for-next-wave-of-infections-satyendar-jain-101628188913924.html
06-08-2021||Delhi||Won’t act against those who helped Covid-19 patients, provided oxygen: Govt||The Delhi government on Thursday told the high court that it has proposed to take a “sympathetic view” by not initiating any action against any individual, organisation involved in the distribution of oxygen to the needy patients during the second wave of Covid-19 during April-May this year.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government’s Drug Control Department, informed a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh that the department intends to withdraw the prosecution against the individuals and organizations that were involved in the free distribution of medical oxygen, without any intention of commercial gains and whose action has not resulted in hindrance in regular supply of medical oxygen.The government’s submission came on a petition by Deepak Gupta, represented by advocate Virag Gupta, who demanded lodging of an FIR over allegations that some politicians procured Covid-19 medicines in huge quantities and distributed them even as patients were running from pillar to post to buy them.An application was also filed by advocate Vedansh Anand in the pending petition, alleging similar charges against AAP MLAs Praveen Kumar and Preeti Tomar.During the last hearing on July 29, the court cautioned the drug control department against prosecuting the people who acted as good Samaritans and distributed oxygen cylinders during the second Covid-19 wave.In a status report on July 8, the department told the court that it has initiated prosecution against MLA Praveen Kumar after he was found allegedly hoarding oxygen cylinders. The report also said that prosecution has been launched against BJP MP Gautam Gambhir’s Foundation (GGF), and AAP MLA Imran Hussain for alleged “unauthorised purchase/procurement, stocking and distribution of medicine and medical oxygen”.On July 29, the bench slammed the department for initiating action against MLA Praveen Kumar, who represents Jangpura constituency, and said it was trying to target a particular political party. The bench said if the department starts prosecuting people like this, it will have to initiate action against “half the city”.“How can you prosecute him (Kumar)? The State, both Centre and Delhi government, failed in providing sufficient oxygen to people in Delhi. There were some Samaritans who provided oxygen. You can’t prosecute them…. You’re very consciously targeting political parties. It’s very unfortunate. We will not permit this,” the bench said.Earlier, on May 31, the court accepted the clean chit to MLA Tomar, but slammed the drug controller for giving a clean chit to Gambhir. The court had said that its faith was completely “shaken” on the “trash” findings of the drug controller. Gambhir distributed a Covid-19 drug, Fabiflu, through his foundation to the people in east Delhi free of cost. On June 3, the drug controller told the court that the foundation has violated the provisions of the Drug and Cosmetics Act as he did not have any licence to procure stock and distribute drugs and oxygen.In the last hearing, the bench said that even though action against Gambhir was justified because he acted “irresponsibly” by hoarding medicines, action could not be taken against Kumar and others who distributed oxygen cylinders.During the last hearing, senior advocate Kailash Vasdev, appearing for Gambhir, urged the high court to grant him a hearing as he wished to make certain clarifications and also requested the court to clarify in its order that the adverse observations made against him will not be used against the BJP MP before the trial court where prosecution has been initiated against him. The high court made it clear that the observations made by it earlier in these hearings will not come in the way of proceedings in the trial court.Allegations were also made against AAP MLA Imran Hussain that he was hoarding oxygen for distributing free in his constituency. The court on May 13 dismissed the plea against Hussain taking note of the amicus curiae’s submission that there was no illegality in the purchase and distribution of medical oxygen by the MLA from Ballimaran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wont-act-against-those-who-helped-covid-19-patients-provided-oxygen-delhi-govt-101628188853980.html
06-08-2021||Delhi||16 of 32 Delhi excise zones auctioned to retail licensees||The Delhi government on Thursday held a draw of lots to appoint liquor retail licensees in each of its newly demarcated 32 excise zones in the national capital. By the time the draw was adjourned at 7.40pm, 16 of the 32 zones were auctioned off with the highest bid for a single zone going up to ₹315 crore, about 45% higher than the reserve price set by the state excise department.The Delhi government, on June 28, floated tenders for appointing new licensees for the retail sale of liquor in the national capital. Following the tendering process, on Thursday, all 32 zones were put up for auction for the first time. Twelve zones were cancelled or disqualified from the auction process as they had just one or no bidder. The remaining four zones will be auctioned on Friday as the process could not be completed on Thursday, despite the auctioning starting around 11am and continuing till 7.40pm.Under the Delhi Excise Policy, 2021, the city has been divided into 32 zones and allotment of licences is now being done on a zonal basis. Those who won a zone on Thursday will now be given L-7Z or L-7V licences which are meant for retail sale of Indian and foreign liquor (except country liquor) in Delhi.Zone 31, which is the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and Delhi Cantonment area, garnered the highest price of ₹315 crore, against a reserve price was ₹217 crore. However, this was not the zone which earned the government the highest profit. That was Zone 32, or the airport zone, which went for ₹235 crore against a reserve price of ₹105 crore — about 124% higher than the reserve price.Zone 19 — covering Daryaganj, Swarup Nagar, GTB Nagar, Gopal Nagar, Chhatarpur, Chittaranjan (CR) Park, Snagam Vihar, Chandni Chowk and Nand Nagri — was sold for ₹313 crore, while its reserve price was ₹225 crore. Zone 29 — covering Safdarjung Enclave, Hauz Khaz, Kotla Mubarakpur, Ashok Nagar, Rohtash Nagar, Kirari Wazirpur and so on— was auctioned for ₹301 crore, against the reserve price of ₹225 crore.The zones which saw the lowest bids, against their reserve price included Zone 13 at ₹236 crore (Malviya Nagar, Karol Bagh, Delhi Gate); Zone 27 at ₹235 crore (Tilak Nagar, Karampura, Karawal Nagar East, Khanjawla); and Zone 23 at ₹234 crore (Uttam Nagar, Mayur Vihar Phase 1, Rohini-C, Vishwas Nagar). It is to be noted that all figures given in this report have been rounded off.By appointing new retail licensees, the Delhi government is trying to pave the way for a range of sweeping reforms to boost the city-state’s revenue, to crack down on the liquor mafia and improve user experience under the new excise policy.The zones for which the draw will be held on Friday include Zone 20 (Rajinder Nagar, Model Town, Rajouri Garden), Zone 4 (Greater Kailash, Malka Ganj, Aman Vihar), Zone 26 (Dilshad Colony, Shahdara, Kalkaji) and Zone 17 (Bijwasan, Adarsh Nagar, Rohini-F).The 12 zones that were disqualified due to lack of bidders include Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 9, Zone 16 and so on. These zones will have to be re-tendered now, senior excise officials said.Under the new policy, business hours have been fixed as from 10am to 10pm, while those at the airport may open round-the-clock. This development is significant because as per the new excise policy, the Delhi government will completely exit the retail sale of liquor. So, all existing retail licences — L6, L6FG, L6FE — will not be renewed after September 30, unless extended further, as these were meant for government liquor vends. However, country liquor vends will operate till the new country liquor policy is framed.Naresh Goyal, a liquor trader and president of Delhi liquor traders association said the most of companies that won the bids are names that are unheard of in the liquor business in Delhi. “There were several pharmaceutical companies and agro-based companies that won the bids today. But, a large chunk of the zones got cancelled because there were few bidders. The reason for the tepid response is the high earnest money deposit (EMD) that the government is asking for. Fresh tenders will have to be floated for the cancelled zones now,” he said.Bidders have to pay a non-refundable fee of ₹10 lakh and an EMD of ₹30 crore, if applying for a single zone; and ₹60 crore as EMD, if bidding for two or more zones. Until now, the EMD was ₹8 lakh only.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/16-of-32-delhi-excise-zones-auctioned-to-retail-licensees-zone-31-gets-highest-bid-of-315-cr-101628188806083.html

Records from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) show that the first week of August has so far remained dry with most parts of the city receiving trace rainfall. On Thursday, the IMD revised its forecast where it said that light rain and thundershowers are likely over the next three days. Earlier, it issued an orange alert with heavy rainfall expected in parts of Delhi for August 6.“The forecast had to be revised, as the low-pressure system over Madhya Pradesh started gradually weakening from August 5. There is no intense pressure system that can trigger rainfall. The monsoon trough is expected to gradually shift to the Himalayan foothills by August 10, which will result in break monsoon-like conditions in Delhi and adjoining areas,” said a senior IMD official. The monsoon arrived in Delhi on July 13, at least 16 days behind schedule. Back in June, the IMD predicted that monsoon will arrive in the Capital by June 15. However, it revised its predictions for the arrival of monsoon saying that break monsoon conditions developed, which delayed its onset.Independent forecasters too said Delhi is likely to receive patchy rainfall from August 6-9. “From August 10-11, break monsoon conditions may persist, as the trough is likely to move far to the Himalayan foothills, which means westerly winds will start blowing over Delhi. The break may last for five to six days. Monsoon is expected to revive thereafter from August 16-17. Delhi and the neighbouring areas may then receive good spells,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of Skymet, a private forecaster.According to weather data available with the IMD, the maximum temperature on Thursday was 35.3 degrees Celsius, a notch above the season’s normal and the minimum was 26.5°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/imd-predicts-light-rain-in-delhi-over-next-3-days-101628188793936.html
06-08-2021||Delhi||SDMC launches a virtual tour of Delhi’s heritage||At a time when most interactions from meetings to classes and even religious worship have gone virtual on account of the pandemic, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has come up with a virtual tour of Delhi’s heritage. All one has to do is get on to the SDMC website, click on a link and then sit back to enjoy the beauty of the colonial style Daryaganj police station and the old library in Mehrauli.The civic body on Thursday launched an e-book titled ”Glorious Heritage of Delhi”. The e-book, which has photographs along with a small description and history of the site, was launched by lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal via video conferencing on Thursday.South corporation mayor Mukesh Suryan said the step was taken to ensure better conservation of heritage sites, many of which have been lying abandoned for years.The civic body’s Heitage Conservation Cell has identified a total of 475 heritage sites under the corporation’s jurisdiction. “The first volume of the e-book is a compilation of 108 such sites, including monuments, heritage buildings and memorials. The rest of the identified sites will be compiled under two more volumes,” said Suryan.According to a senior SDMC official, the sites identified for compilation are those that have been notified as heritage structures by the central government’s heritage conservation committee in 2010 and 2016, respectively. “Some of the sites that find place in the e-book date back to 1132 AD. For instance Anangtal, an ancient water body that is now dried up, behind the Yogmaya temple, finds a mention in Budh Sridhar’s book in 1132 AD,” said the official, who asked not to be named.Most of these sites are maintained by trusts and conservation agencies. Baijal said the civic body must tie up with private agencies and work towards conservation of abandoned structures on public-private partnership mode. “The municipal corporation must conserve these structures in association with private agencies,” said Baijal.SDMC commissioner Gyanesh Bharti said the heritage conservation cell is working towards creating larger awareness for the conservation of Delhi’s built up heritage. “Through the e-book, people can access information about the sites just by visiting the website,” said Bharti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sdmc-launches-a-virtual-tour-of-delhi-s-heritage-101628188734670.html
06-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi riots: Couldn’t find source of Tanha’s statement leak, police tells HC||The city police on Thursday told the Delhi high court that it questioned several officers and journalists but was unable to establish the source of the leak of Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha’s alleged confessional statement which was part of a sheet filed in connection to the northeast Delhi riots. Police further said that they are issuing directions to ensure such issues are “not repeated in the future”.In a status report filed before justice Mukta Gupta, Delhi Police said , “The enquiry officer could not establish the officers/office from where the details of investigation were shared with the media… during the present enquiry the enquiry officer has examined various media personnel who refused to share the details of their source from where they had accessed the investigation related documents.”Advocate Rajat Nair, appearing for the police, further said that no leaks have been made by the police.Tanha, who is accused in the larger conspiracy of hatching the riots in February last year, had moved the high court last year, alleging misconduct by police officials in leaking his alleged disclosure statement in the main charge sheet, which was recorded by the probe agency during the investigation, to the media. He is currently out on bail.On the last date of hearing on July 6, the court had admonished the police for the delay in concluding its enquiry.Pursuant to this, on Thursday, the police informed the court that directions are being issued to officers to handle case files with utmost alacrity, and that the charge sheets also be filed strictly following the due process. “It must also ensure that such issues raised in the present matter are not repeated in future,” the police said, adding that no prejudice has been caused to Tanha in his exercise of the right to a free and fair trial.The court, noting the submissions, put the matter for further hearing on August 11.Tanha, who was arrested in May 2020, was recently released from jail after the high court granted him bail in the riots case on a larger conspiracy.The police had said that Tanha, a resident of Abul Fazal Enclave in Shaheen Bagh, was a member of the Students Islamic Organisation and was part of the Jamia Coordination Committee which spearheaded protests against the new citizenship law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-riots-couldn-t-find-source-of-tanha-s-statement-leak-police-tells-hc-101628188735273.html

Last month, the government allowed 100% seating in Metro trains, revising its earlier limit of only allowing 50% seating in trains.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC, said, “More than two lakh passengers come to the Metro stations daily during peak hours. Since the number of available seating space is not enough to permit entry to all two lakh passengers, they are required to be regulated…This will obviously lead to a large number of passengers having to wait outside the stations.”While there is demand for the opening of more gates at stations, DMRC officials said that it will become difficult to regulate the crowd and ensure social distancing if more gates are opened.DMRC officials said that there have been incidents of impatient passengers trying to barge into Metro stations by forcibly opening and damaging the gates, and manhandling the DMRC and CISF personnel on duty. “Such acts not only cause law and order issues but also put lives of co-passengers and Metro officials at risk, besides increasing the risk of Covid spread,” said Dayal. DMRC has urged people to travel during peak hours only if it is absolutely essential.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/long-queues-outside-metro-stations-to-continue-as-dmrc-says-need-to-ensure-distancing-inside-101628188677273.html
06-08-2021||Delhi||DU to reopen for final-year science students from August 16||The Delhi University (DU) on Thursday said it will resume in-person classes and practical work for final-year undergraduate and postgraduate science students from August 16, observing all Covid-19 protocols.In a notification issued on Thursday, DU registrar Vikas Gupta said, “Taking note of the decline in the number of Covid-19 cases, it has been decided that classes and practical/ project work etc. in respect of postgraduate and undergraduate students in science courses in the university and its colleges shall be conducted in physical mode with effect from 16.08.2021 observing necessary protocols to prevent the spread of Covid-19.”After remaining shut for over eight months on account of the pandemic, DU allowed MPhil and PhD students to resume their research work last November, following directions from the University Grants Commission (UGC). In February this year, the university allowed colleges and departments to start calling final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students to campus but in small batches. However, the varsity again closed after the second wave of pandemic swept through the country in April.The classes for students enrolled in the first- and second-year of undergraduate courses and first-year of postgraduate courses will continue in the online mode.The university also asked colleges and hostels to ensure Covid-19 appropriate behaviour while providing accommodation to outstation students. “Ensure strict adherence to all guidelines while providing accommodation to eligible outstation students in consultation with dean of student welfare and proctor of the university,” Gupta said in the notification.The DU teachers’ association (DUTA), however, raised concerns over the decision to partially reopen campuses. “It is easy to write that all protocols should be followed but how will one ensure that they are followed or can be followed? In both undergraduate colleges and science departments, classrooms and labs are crowded. Also, can the university expect students to return to Delhi and find accommodation within 10 days? The notification declares that Covid cases are decreasing even as there are reports that a third wave will be building up anytime now,” said DUTA member Abha Dev Habib.Responding to these concerns, a senior DU official said, “A detailed notification will be issued mentioning all the covid-appropriate guidelines in line with those already recommended by the UGC and the Centre.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-to-reopen-for-final-year-science-students-from-august-16-101628188676685.html

Mandi has remained Virbhadra’s turf for long. After making it to the Lok Sabha for the first time after winning the Mahasu Parliamentary seat in 1962 and then again in 1967, Virbhadra had switched to the Mandi in 1971 and registered a win. He, however, lost from the seat in 1977 but was again elected from the constituency in 1980 and later in 2009.After Virbhadra’s death on July 8 due to post-Covid complications, the Congress had invited to Pratibha to contest from Arki, the assembly constituency which he represented. Pratibha had neither given her assent nor refused the offer as the family was still weighing the options. Party reviews preparations in ArkiMeanwhile, All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Sanjay Dutt held a review meeting with block Congress office-bearers and workers in Arki on Thursday to review the party’s preparations for the byelections. He exhorted the party workers to work in unity to ensure the victory of the Congress candidate, and said, “Virbhadra Singh played an important part in the development of the state, which can never be forgotten. We have to uphold the work done by him. This will be our true tribute to the Congress and the people of this region,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/congress-keen-on-fielding-pratibha-singh-from-mandi-101628188676225.html
06-08-2021||Delhi||Did not leak Disha Ravi’s info to media, Delhi Police tell Delhi HC||The city police on Thursday told the Delhi high court that it has not leaked any information to the media in connection to its probe in the case against climate activist Disha Ravi for her alleged involvement in sharing a toolkit backing the ongoing farmers’ protest.Justice Rekha Palli, while hearing a plea by Ravi to restrain the police from leaking to the media any probe material in relation to the FIR lodged against her, was informed by advocate Rajat Nair, for the police, that the leak did not happen from its end.In an affidavit filed by Anyesh Roy, deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell unit) of Special Cell, police have said no information or document forming part of the case file, including the subject chats, were shared by the police with any media house or individuals, except the information communicated officially through press briefing or broadcast, which is a matter of record.Ravi was arrested by Delhi Police on February 13 for allegedly being involved in sharing on social media a “toolkit” related to the ongoing farmers’ protest against the Centre’s three new agricultural laws, and was granted bail by a trial court on February 23.In her plea, Ravi said she is “severely aggrieved and prejudiced by the media trial surrounding her arrest and the ongoing investigation, where she is being viscerally attacked by the respondent 1 (police) and several media houses”.The Centre also informed the court that Ravi had highlighted her grievances against the “parallel media”, namely digital and print media, social media (micro blogging sites etc) and YouTube channels, in addition to ‘over the top’ platforms. However, Central government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul told the court that in the absence of any complaint, it cannot take action against channels under the Cable TV Regulation Act as Ravi had not approached them.He also submitted that the issue of correct interpretation as to which broadcast is violative of the programme code enumerated under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act 1995, along with the Code of Ethics and News Broadcasting Standards Regulations, is pending consideration before the Supreme Court, adding that it should wait or dispose the plea.Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate Akhil Sibal said that some protection or guidelines need to be ensured to protect the privacy of individuals, considering media will not reveal its sources and the police are denying the leaks.The court noted that the petition raises an important question of public importance, and listed the petition for arguments on September 27In her petition before the high court, she also sought to restrain the media from publishing the content or extract of any of her private chats, including those on WhatsApp.The high court, in an earlier order, had asked media houses to ensure that no leaked investigation material is broadcast as it could affect the probe and had directed Delhi Police to abide by its stand that it has not leaked nor intends to leak any probe details to the press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/did-not-leak-disha-ravi-s-info-to-media-delhi-police-tell-delhi-hc-101628188675004.html
06-08-2021||Delhi||DU advises students to fill applications with caution||The Delhi University (DU) on Thursday advised candidates seeking admission to various undergraduate courses to fill online application forms with utmost caution as they will not be allowed to edit it after submission.The university, which started the online registration process for admission to various undergraduate courses across its 63 colleges from Monday, received over one lakh application for the available 70,000 seats till Thursday evening. The last date of registration is August 31.During its first virtual open house session, meant to field admission related queries of candidates, on Thursday, DU officials cautioned students and asked them to re-check everything before submitting the forms. The University completely shifted its admission process since last year in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.“It won’t be possible for the University to provide the editing option after submission of form to students since we are on a very tight schedule. After closing the registration on August 31, we need to give the data of applicants to the National Testing Agency (NTA) that will conduct entrance exams for admission to some undergraduate courses in September. So we need to give that data at least 15 days before the exam. That’s why the edit option is not there,” said Sanjeev Singh, director of the University’s computer department.Admissions to all undergraduate courses – barring 15 courses – are conducted on the basis of merit and scores in the previous qualifying examination. Admission to postgraduate, MPhil-PhD courses, and the 15 undergraduate courses including journalism, finance, and music, will be done through DU entrance tests (DUET) conducted by the NTA in the last week of September this year.Advising students not to fill the forms in one go, Singh said, “We have already asked the students to fill the form properly, and check and recheck everything before finally submitting it. There is enough time for them to go through everything. They should not rush to pay the registration fee and submit the form. The last date for confirming registration and payment of fees is August 31.”Asked about differing theory and practical components among CBSE and their counterparts in state boards during the virtual open house session, DU officials clarified: “The theory and practical component will be automatically converted into a 70:30 ratio by the software on DU admission portal. Students need not be worried about it.”Officials said the varsity will soon upload examples of such score conversion on its website.“Students should wait for it rather than filling wrong information in the form,” said Suman Kumar, a member of the DU admission committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-edit-option-after-submitting-ug-forms-this-year-du-advises-students-to-fill-applications-with-caution-101628188673902.html
06-08-2021||Delhi||No unjust riches: CBSE objects to demand for exam fee refund||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Friday told the Supreme Court that it will not charge any extra fees from students choosing to take improvement examination, but the board rejected suggestions that it should return the board exam fees since the tests were not conducted this year.The CBSE and the Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) unanimously objected to a petition by Association of Private Schools of Uttar Pradesh which sought refund of exam fees besides raising other issues. The two boards said they were “self-financing” bodies receiving no grant from the government. In separate affidavits filed before the court, the boards said examination fees of ₹1,500 per student is the only means to pay their staff and finance the expenses for the examinations.The petitioner association argued that when examinations stood cancelled, there was no question of collecting examination fee. Advocate Ravi Prakash Gupta representing the association said, “As per our estimates, the CBSE has saved ₹200 crore by not holding physical examination. This money can be either refunded or be used to finance mobile phones for poor students.”A bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna said, “We don’t need your suggestions. Tell us if you have a legal right to get refund.” The judges agreed with the boards that the decision to cancel examinations was taken at the last minute by when all preparations for examinations (question papers, answer books) got over.In an affidavit, CBSE Controller of Examinations, Sanyam Bhardwaj said, “The respondent CBSE has not unjustly enriched itself by collecting examination fees which has and is being utilised by it for the purpose of conducting examination and also for the purpose of rendering various services (mark sheet, pass certificate) to students.”The results committee – comprising five members (for Class 12) and seven members (for Class 10) – set up this year for tabulating marks through internal assessment , required CBSE to spend around ₹40 crore for paying honorarium to the committee members, CBSE informed the Court.CBSE had enrolled nearly 1.45 million students for Class 12 this year as compared to CISCE with over 100,000 students. After the government decided to cancel the examinations this year, the board came out with an evaluation scheme by which Class 12 students were to be assessed based on a 30:30:40 formula, which took the best of three subject marks of Class 10 boards (30%), annual results of Class 11 (30%) and pre-boards or internal assessment conducted during Class 12 (40%).The court was informed by CBSE that all schools affiliated with it will publish detailed results of the Class 12 and 10 students, comprising of their internal assessment marks, highest average of the school in the preceding three years, and the final allocation of marks by the Results Committee, in order to enable students to decide on giving the improvement exams, to be held between August 25 and September 15.The CBSE told the court that it soon will send a circular in this regard to schools. The board also informed the court that the results of the improvement examination will be declared by September 30, while the CISCE plans to release the same tentatively around September 20.The petitioner had sought specific dates on holding of the improvement examination and declaration of results.The association told the court that most students who performed well in their internal exams were surprised to find their final scores to be less. According to petitioners, this was due to the rationalisation policy prescribed by CBSE which required the results committee to moderate marks in terms of the school’s best performance in the past three years. The association argued that students need to be told how much marks were reduced as a result of the moderation exercise.The bench remarked, “Going by the newspaper reports, everybody has scored very high marks.” However, since this data will be readily available with schools, the court agreed to grant this request. CBSE agreed to issue a circular in this regard. The court said, “On instructions, CBSE has submitted that it will issue directions to all the schools registered under that Board to notify the internal assessment marks, highest average in the preceding three years and the marks assigned by the Result Committee on case-to-case basis. That shall be the responsibility of the concerned school(s) where the students are pursuing studies.”Both the examination boards – CBSE and the CISCE responded to the suggestions put forth by the association and submitted a tentative schedule for the improvement exams. CBSE counsel Rupesh Kumar informed the court that examination will be conducted for three category of students – those who apply for correction of results through dispute resolution mechanism, compartment candidates, and private/Patrachar/second chance compartment candidates. The option to register for the physical examination may be made available by August 10, he added.The association demanded that the two boards should consider announcing the results by September 20 due to college admissions and entrance examinations such as JEE, NEET, etc. This court accepted the schedules provided by the two boards, and refused to pre-pone the dates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-unjust-riches-cbse-objects-to-demand-for-exam-fee-refund-101628188615112.html

Police said they are in the process of unearthing the others involved in the racket.Joint commissioner of police (crime) Alok Kumar said police had received information about a drugs syndicate run by a Nigerian national. “We learnt that the syndicate is involved in drug trafficking from Delhi to Punjab, Haryana, UP, Mumbai and Kolkata after procuring it from Afghanistan. The informer revealed that two women drug handlers would go to Punjab to delivery a huge consignment of heroin in a cab on July 28. We laid a trap and arrested the two women near Dwarka Mod, while they were on their way to Punjab in a cab. We recovered two kilograms of fine quality heroin,” Kumar said.During interrogation, the two women -- Phocum hailed from West Bengal and Madhu belonged to Punjab --confessed that they had left their families and were living together in Uttam Nagar. The two women told police that they had met in Tihar Jail in 2013, when Phocum was arrested in a drug trafficking case by the Narcotics Control Bureau and Madhu was already inside in a cheating case.“They met in jail and became good friends. In jail, they came in contact with a Nigerian national named Henry, who too was behind bars for drug trafficking. He recruited them. When the two women came out on bail, they joined the drug trafficking gang and proved quite useful, as police do not usually suspect middle-age women,” said Joint CP Kumar.Police said the two women have been supplying large quantities of drugs to various cities of Punjab, Haryana, Bareilly, Mumbai and Kolkata for the past two years. “They revealed that the heroin comes from Afghanistan and Pakistan. They got ₹1 lakh each for every trip they made out of Delhi. Investigation of the case is in progress and raids are being conducted to unearth the drug syndicate,” added Joint CP Kumar.Meanwhile, in another operation, police arrested a man from Bihar for smuggling around 20kg marijuana from Bihar into the Capital, for distribution in parts of northwest Delhi.The suspect, Vikas Kumar (27) told police that he worked at a shop selling electrical items in Shaheen Bagh but had lost his job during the second lockdown due to Covid-19 and turned to drug smuggling to make money.Police said they are questioning Kumar to trace his accomplices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-women-part-of-an-interstate-smuggling-racket-held-with-two-kilos-of-heroin-in-dwarka-101628188613908.html

The foremost responsibility of a responsible government is to not take any problem being faced by the people lightly... The ministry has throughout the monsoon season been proactive in holding meetings of officials across concerned departments to ensure that Delhi doesn’t face any problems because of waterlogging. In a meeting held last month, the minister had directed the officials to use pumps and refurbish roads quickly wherever waterlogging...has caused damage.”Officials said that in the meeting Jain specifically took stock of the situation in Narela Industrial Area which witnesses waterlogging because of low capacity of existing drains in the area.In the last two weeks, as Delhi witnessed moderate to heavy rains, several areas witnessed heavy waterlogging, including Yamuna Bazar, parts of Connaught Place, stretches near the Barapullah flyover, Ashram, Anand Vihar, Sarita Vihar, ITO, Pragati Maidan, Alaknanda, Palam, Moti Nagar and large parts of Delhi Cantonment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/waterlogging-delhi-govt-tells-departments-to-take-quick-action-101628188555583.html

If anyone wins gold, silver or bronze in an individual event, he or she will get ₹6 crore, ₹4 crore and ₹2 crore respectively,” he added. Hockey Olympians like Devesh Chauhan, Rahul Singh, Sujit Kumar, Ali Saeed, Danish Mujtaba, Shakeel Ahmed Khan, Syed Ali Zafar Iqbal, Mohinder Pal Singh, Jagbir Singh and other hockey greats like Rajneesh Mishra, Arf Mohd Khan, Sanjay Bisht and Atif Idrish also praised the team. Zafar Iqbal, a key member of India’s last Olympic gold medal winning team in the 1980 Moscow Games, said he had his heart in his mouth in the final few minutes of the match when Germany were attacking in search of the equaliser.“History has been made. We have broken the jinx. It’s a miracle. It’s going to have a big impact on the game. It will revive the sport in the country. It’s a new beginning, a new dawn,” he said.“Since my childhood, I have been hearing that India won gold medals at the Olympics eight times, but never got to see such an occasion in my lifetime. But today, it’s like a dream come true and now I can say that I have seen India winning medals at the Olympics,” former Indian hockey captain Rajneesh Mishra said. Former Junior India star Vijay Singh, senior coach SK Lahiri, Kanpur Hockey secretary TP Singh and UP Olympic Association secretary Anandeshwar Pandey too admired India’s podium finish at the Games. “I watched the match and I can feel the joy that comes when your country wins after 40 years,” Pandey said over the phone from Tokyo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-shares-nation-s-joy-as-india-end-hockey-olympic-medal-drought-bag-bronze-101628188554590.html

Staffer and officials are not in their seats on time. On the other hand, the computer server is frequently down stopping all biometric registration.Working hours start from 10 am for both transport and non-transport departments. The learning license department starts from 7.30 am.On Thursday, when HT visited the Pune RTO office at Sangamwadi, many RTO staffers and officers were not present at 10 am. Just 30 per cent of the staff was present there on time, none of them senior RTO officials or inspectors. “I came to the RTO office for a transfer. When I visited the transport section there was only one staffer and she told me to wait till the concerned officer comes in. I had to wait till 11.30 am, when the officer came and my work was completed,” said Kedar Mane. It is the same situation at the learning licence section. Applicants who were given an appointment were waiting because the server was down. To get a learning licence, an applicant has to go through document verification and biometrics, and finally appear for an online test. The server was down for an hour. “When my number came for document verification for a learning licence I was told to wait as the server was down. This is not expected from the RTO department, as we are risking our lives to come to such a crowded place and then we have to wait for a long time because of technical issues,” said Shreya Kajale, an applicant. Though the state transport department has started learning licence test online and one can get it processed at home, many still prefer to come to the RTO. A few years ago, RTO agents were moved out from office premises and now those agents are working from outside the compound. People stand on the boundary walls of the RTO office and from the other side agents take documents and other necessary items to complete the licences. Pune regional transport officer Ajit Shinde said, “We are taking all the necessary safety precautions within the office and staff has been instructed to come on time to work efficiently. The technical issues are solved immediately by our technical team and there won’t be any complaint in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-rto-staffers-show-up-late-servers-constantly-down-leaving-public-waiting-for-hours-101628188435903.html

High Court justice Girish Kulkarni heard petitioners and asked all sides to file a written say within a month. The High Court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by BJP leaders Ujwal Keskar and Suhas Joshi, through their counsels, advocates Sanjeev Gorwadkar and Ritvik Joshi, challenging the July 19 decision by the state government instructing the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) to created the development plan for the merged villages. The state government decision is being opposed by BJP based on the contention that the 23 villages have been merged in PMC, which is now responsible for carrying out development in these areas. Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol had earlier said, “Since these parts (23 villages) are under PMC limits, PMRDA does not have legal rights to carry out planning for this area”. Keskar said, “The High Court heard our objections on Thursday. Some citizens from the 23 villages have also filed a petition demanding that Development Plan be prepared by PMRDA. By considering all these points, the court has instructed all parties to submit a written say.” Ganesh Bidkar, BJP’s leader of the house in the PMC said, “There have been two PILs filed on DP issue. In the first PIL, BJP members have challenged the metropolitan committee formed by state government for which the HC has given a stay. The second PIL is about the DP in 23 villages challenging government’s decision.” According to Bidkar in the second PIL, BJP has taken a stand that PMRDA cannot prepare the DP for the areas which are now part of PMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-asks-all-parties-for-written-statement-on-dp-for-merged-villages-101628188317108.html
06-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi journalist allegedly involved in Chinese spy racket got Hawala money||Alleged Chinese spies paid journalist Rajeev Sharma through Hawala transactions in exchange for sensitive information, four protected witnesses identified in the police charge sheet as W, X, Y and Z have told the court in their statements, officials privy to the investigation in the case said.The four witnesses, who claimed to have interacted with Sharma until his arrest in September last year, recorded their statements before a judge under Code of Criminal Procedure 164 in November 2020. Their statements, attached to the charge sheet, are admissible evidence during trial.Sharma, a freelance journalist, was arrested on September 14, 2020 by Delhi police’s special cell for passing on classified information to Chinese intelligence agencies. Along with Sharma, the police also arrested a Chinese woman named Qing Shi and a Nepalese man Sher Singh alias Sher Bahadur. Sharma and Qing, police said, ran shell companies through which they received money from Chinese agencies. The Enforcement Directorate that is carrying out a parallel investigation against Sharma in a money laundering case against him, arrested the freelance scribe last month.The police filed the charge sheet in the case on April 2021. It is on the basis of this charge sheet and evidence submitted in court by police that ED registered a case against Sharma.In the charge sheet, witness Y said he collected money from a Chinese national and handed it to Sharma as remuneration for passing the information. Another person identified as Z said he received over $5000 from a foreign account in his bank account for Sharma. Z said Sharma requested him to collect money on his behalf.Another person, who is not a protected witness, told the police that he used to manage Sharma’s YouTube account and that the journalist asked him to collect money from the Chinese on his behalf. His statement is also a part of the charge sheet.Two other protected witnesses, X and W, in their statements said that they supplied Hawala money to Qing Shi in Yuan. They also alleged that Qing asked them to exchange the Chinese currency in Indian rupees several times.Police have said Sharma was in contact with a Chinese intelligence official, identified only as Michael, since 2016, and with another Chinese person identified as George, since 2019. Police have also named a third Chinese intelligence official Xao, who is invovled in the case.Sharma allegedly sent Michael classified information related to Indian army deployment on the China-Bhutan-India tri-junction, including Doklam. Police in the charge sheet have also attached a report from the Director General of Military Intelligence confirming that the documents police recovered from Sharma’s house were classified. It also mentioned that Sharma passed on information related to Tibetan spiritual leader, Dalai Lama and Indo-China relations. The papers that police seized have been submitted to the court in a sealed cover.Police are still probing how Sharma managed to get hold of the sensitive documents. Police have mentioned in the charge sheet that “despite sincere efforts” there were unable to trace Sharma’s source who provided him the classified documents.“His handler George used to send the money to him through India-based shell companies MZ Mall and MZ Pharmacy situated at Mahipalpur, being run by Chinese nationals Zhang Zheng, Zhang Lixia and Qing Shing. Zhang Zheng and Zhang Lixia left for China and could not return due to the Covid-19 situation. The companies were being run by Qing,” police said in the charge sheet adding that Qing, and the third accused Sher Singh were named as directors of these shell companies.As evidence, police have also attached a Kotak Mahindra bank account linked to MZ Mall, which showed transactions of around ₹2 crore. Police also attached Sharma’s travel record to China and Maldives and added that during these visits Sharma was meeting Chinese intelligence officers George and Michael.Sharma’s counsel Amish Aggarwala dismissed the allegations as false, and said they will approach the high court for quashing of charges.“These are false charges. Police filed charge sheet without recording any statement u/s 164 or 161 CrPC, of any official of ministry of defence or the armed forces claiming that any secret/ classified document was missing or stolen or handed over to my client. In case, any such document was stolen/ removed, then these matter would have reported to high ups and the Police, which was not done here,” Aggarwala said.He also said that because no case was made out from the charge sheet, the court has not taken cognizance. “I requested court even today to take cognizance but it has been posted for November 15, 2021. The charge sheet also does not proved that he was working for any Chinese agent. We are going to file case in the Delhi high court for quashing charges. Also, if the documents were supplied to my client, then police should investigate, who supplied it. Police are silent on this. My client can’t manufacture the classified/ secret documents. On the contrary, the charge sheet include a letter from the air force that the seized documents are not secret/classified,” Aggarwala said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-journalist-allegedly-involved-in-chinese-spy-racket-got-hawala-money-say-witnesses-in-the-case-101628188316571.html

IGR Shravan Hardikar has charged the two sub-registrars for carrying out registration in contravention of rules namely, registering property documents without MAHARERA registration and handing over office operations to a private person. Pune city has 27 registration offices where property documents are registered by citizens following verification of documents, legalities and payment of stamp duty. The IGR action comes following complaints that registration was being carried out in violation of the law at some of the property registration offices in the Pune region.According to a state government-appointed inquiry committee, large-scale violations were reported at Haveli registration office number 14 where 195 documents were found to be registered without a MAHARERA registration number. Upon visiting the office, a high-level team of state government officials found alleged losses to the tune of Rs20 lakh.The team also visited Haveli sub-registration office number 22 and found anomalies such as staff coming late to the office, private persons carrying out official work inside the office, government OTPs being shared with private persons, and absence of professional scanning of documents. The team documented its findings and submitted a report to the government after which action was taken by IGR Hardikar. The action came after Mantralaya received complaints of illegal registrations being carried out in the city in connivance with concerned officials. It is part of an in-depth investigation into doubtful cases of property registration of unauthorised constructions and illegal plotting initiated by the Maharashtra government. As part of this probe, as many as 300,000 documents registered at 27 sub-registrars’ offices over the past three years have been searched and verified.IGR Hardikar could not be reached for comment and a message sent to him went unanswered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-sub-registrars-suspended-for-violation-of-rules-101628188313907.html
06-08-2021||Pune||World Owl Awareness Day: 40% of respondents still afraid of owls, says survey||Even as “World Owl Awareness Day” was recently celebrated on August 4, an ongoing research paper to be published on how people perceive the owl by Dr Satish Pande, honorary wildlife warden of the Ela Foundation, has found that 40% of people are still afraid of owls and believe that they are a bad omen.“It is indeed shocking to know that even in this era, people still have mixed perceptions about this bird which is also looked upon as the vehicle of Goddess Laxmi. Some are extremely afraid while some harbour superstitions about the owl, whether they are educated or otherwise. We have surveyed people from all strata: farmers, shepherds, professionals, teachers and students,” Dr Pande said. “It is very important to be more sensitive towards owls and get rid of superstitious beliefs about them. There have been stray incidents of owl trapping that were addressed immediately,” he added.Dr Pande has spent several years studying the mysterious bird. “Under the Ela Foundation, we conduct studies and long-term surveys of owls in western Maharashtra using the ‘nearest neighbour distance method’ confirmed by G-statistics. There are four species found in western Maharashtra that are often seen in the Purandar area. As per our surveys, the population density of the Indian Eagle Owl is one pair in every 4.5 to 6kilometre of suitable habitat; that of the Motted Wood Owl is one pair for every 5.5 to 8kilometre; and that of the Spotted Owlet is one pair in every 2.5 to 4.5kilometre. The oft-seen species is the Barn Owl; these birds are common in human-occupied urban and rural areas and their population is higher, proportional to the availability of garbage, open drains and litter frequented by rats and bandicoots,” Dr Pande informed. Pune constitutes a suitable habitat for every species of owl that is closer to urban and human-occupied areas, he said. The Indian Eagle Owl is found in open, hilly areas; the Brown Fish Owl near permanent water bodies; the Motted Wood Owl on cropped land; the Spotted Owlet in deciduous forests and fringe areas habituated by humans; while the Brown Wood Owl is found in evergreen forests, he added.Apart from the species of owl found in the state and their habitat, Dr Pande raised concerns over the increasing number of owls being found morbid or dead due to consumption of rodents that have ingested pesticides and reduction in the owl population due to their territories including fallow lands, croplands and hills being diverted for urbanisation. Several previously occupied owl habitats are now sadly empty, he pointed out. “Owls are nocturnal and are facing serious problems mainly due to human intervention in their habitats, chemicals, electrocutions and road accidents. Due to road accidents having drastically reduced during the lockdown period and human exclusion from the environment, owl sightings had become more frequent,” he said. During the lockdown, the elusive Brown Fish Owl was spotted in Purandar taluka while Brown Wood Owls were seen on several occasions in the western ghats around Pune, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/40-of-respondents-still-afraid-of-owls-survey-101628188254554.html

However, due to a limited stock of vaccines available, the district’s vaccination drive has been on the wane. On August 1, total vaccinations were as low as 7,800 for the day. The total daily vaccination count in the district has not crossed the 50,000 mark in August, so far, while that number was at 80,000 on some days in July. Private centres in the city are also reporting fewer vaccinations as unvaccinated beneficiaries prefer to wait for free vaccines to be available at the government centres.On Thursday, only Covaxin was available in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) area, as Covishield was out of stock. On Thursday, seven vaccination centres were administering Covaxin in the city limits.(UPDATE FROM PMC WILL BE ADDED)Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said vaccine stock is expected on August 6.“All the vaccines have been distributed to the district health department. We received the last stock of Covishield and Covaxin on August 3. The next batch is due on August 6,” said Dr Deshmukh.He added that there are around 12 private hospitals that were supplied vaccine doses through the health department.“As these hospitals have smaller demands they register through the Cowin application and we supply them the doses. Private hospitals with larger demands buy the vaccine directly from the manufacturer,” said Dr Deshmukh.Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director at Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital said that the response so far from beneficiaries has been good.“We are inoculating at least 200 to 300 first-dose beneficiaries each day. And we have a stock of 30,000 vaccines.

Yadav also announced that his party will organise a dharna across the state to press for this demand on August 7. On the last day of the Monsoon session of Bihar assembly July 30, Yadav also met the CM on this issue.The last caste-based census was conducted and released in 1931, while in 1941, the data was collected but not made public. In 2011, a socio-economic caste census was carried out but the data was again not made public on grounds of “discrepancies”.Meanwhile, after conducting aerial survey of Nalanda, Gaya, Jehanabad and Patna districts, Kumar said the situation was “not very good”. “We need to be alert.

CBI submitted that despite the court’s July 22 order asking the agency to continue its investigation into the allegations of corruption made by former Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh against ex-state home minister Anil Deshmukh, the Maharashtra government was not parting with the documents. The plea filed by CBI, complaining about the state not complying with court orders and directions, will be heard on August 11. During the course of hearing, the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar was informed by additional solicitor general Anil Singh that following the July 22 HC order, the central agency had sought documents pertaining to the allegations made by Singh in his letter to the chief minister on March 20. Additional general solicitor Anil Singh, appearing for CBI, submitted that during the pendency of the petition filed by the state government for deletion of two unnumbered paragraphs from the first information report (FIR) against Deshmukh on April 21, the agency had not sought the documents pertaining to two contentious issues – Shukla’s report and ex-cop Sachin Vaze’s reinstatement in service. Singh said after HC decided on the state’s petition and permitted CBI to continue its investigation, the agency had written to the state intelligence department, seeking documents pertaining to Shukla’s report. But the officer concerned at the state intelligence department refused to share the documents claiming that they were part of an ongoing probe by the government. Singh submitted that the tenor of letter hinted at a threat by the officer and when approached, the DG (director general) said that a state direction was awaited to hand over the documents. Aggrieved by the refusal, CBI had approached the court. After hearing the submissions, the court observed, “Some ACP is threatening CBI officers. Please find out what is the situation. Please do not create an unfair situation that we have to take them to task.” The court, thereafter, issued notice to the state and the additional chief secretary of the home department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/corruption-probe-hc-pulls-up-senior-maharashtra-cop-as-state-denies-documents-to-cbi-101628164913216.html
06-08-2021||Delhi||National Handloom Day: Revive the weave||It was a sight to behold when women in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s council of ministers wore beautiful handloom sarees during the cabinet expansion ceremony in July. The seven-yard wonder stood for elegance, unity, tradition and also power dressing. Brands that support the weavers’ community from across India applauded the move, saying it could go a long way in reviving the declining craft.August 7th is celebrated as the National Handloom Day and in the run up, we look at how brands are keeping up the dying art. “Varanasi has been famous for its Banarasi silk sarees. The art of handloom is dying as machines have taken over hands, compelling artisan to resort to other vocations. Every weaver in Banaras is an artist and they need patrons to appreciate their art. We are trying to keep the heritage alive, providing handpicked assortments of hand-woven pure silk Banarasi sarees. If our cabinet ministers who are idealized by youngsters wear handwoven silk saree, it is definitely going to promote the art of Varanasi,” says Shruti Shah from Sacred Weaves.The weavers in Banaras have also mastered zari work. The intricate weave, Persian motifs and gleaming gold embroidery is one example of the expertise weavers possess. “We worked on projects to revive the art. Uchin work is one such old technique similar to Paithani. While Paithanis are woven on thicker silk, Uchin saris are woven on thinner silk. We are developing saris with a modern touch, with the same technique used for shwetambari and neelambari. Almost 40 rolls of thread are used to weave one line of weft in these shwetambari inspired saris,” says Khushi Shah from Shanti Banaras.Age-old crafts such as the Adai technique, Jaala and Petni are also being revived. “We are also working on ‘Ayyampet’ showcasing a lost craft of ikat mushru. Bopari pallu, another long lost art of double sided ajrakh printed pallu has been revived through a collection. In Udupi clusters of Karnataka where the weaving of coarse cotton sarees is almost extinct, we are helping veteran weavers of Udupi bring out the best of the sarees,” says Anindita Sardar, Design Head and Curation, Taneira.Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/national-handloom-day-revive-the-weave-101628148052662.html
06-08-2021||World||‘Dangerous turning point’: Taliban hammered at UNSC meet on Afghanistan||NEW DELHI: Members of the UN Security Council on Friday made it clear the world community will not accept any government forcibly imposed in Afghanistan by the Taliban, even as India called for the dismantling of terror safe havens and sanctuaries in Pakistan.A meeting of the Security Council held under the Indian presidency to discuss the situation in Afghanistan was given a grim briefing on the fallout of the Taliban’s massive campaign of violence and attacks by Deborah Lyons, the UN secretary-general’s special representative, who said the country was at a “dangerous turning point”.Most of the representatives of the 15 permanent and non-permanent members of the Security Council strongly opposed any military takeover by the Taliban, and the representatives of France and the US said further exemptions from sanctions on Taliban leaders, especially for travel, would be affected by failure to end violence.India holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council for August and played a key role in organising the meeting on Afghanistan.TS Tirumurti, India’s envoy to the UN, listed the surge in Taliban attacks and violence, including the suicide assault on the home of the Afghan defence minister and the killing of Indian journalist Danish Siddiqui, and said the rapid deterioration of security poses a “serious threat to regional peace and stability”.In an obvious reference to Pakistan, Tirumurti said: “For enduring peace in Afghanistan, terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries in the region must be dismantled immediately and terrorist supply chains disrupted. It needs to be ensured that Afghanistan’s neighbours and the region are not threatened by terrorism, separatism and extremism.”He called for “zero tolerance” for all forms of terrorism, and said it is equally important to ensure Afghan soil isn’t used by terror groups to threaten or attack any other country. “Those providing material and financial support to terrorist entities must be held accountable,” he added.The world community should “decide on actions that would help bring a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire”, and ensure the Taliban “engage in negotiations in good faith, eschew the path of violence, severe ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist organisations, and fully commit itself towards reaching a political solution”, Tirumurti added.He also reiterated New Delhi’s support for an inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled peace process that leads to a political settlement that protects the gains of the past two decades and preserves the rights of women, children and minorities.The Afghan envoy to the UN, Ghulam M Isaczai, was more scathing in his criticism of Pakistan’s role in backing the Taliban, which he said, was being assisted in acts of barbarism by “foreign fighters from trans-national terrorist networks”.The Taliban have launched more than 5,500 attacks since mid-April with support from more than 10,000 foreign fighters representing 20 groups, including al-Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and Islamic State.“Importantly, the Taliban continue to enjoy a safe haven in and supply and logistics line extended to their war machine from Pakistan. Graphic reports and video of Taliban fighters congregating close to the Durand Line to enter Afghanistan, fund-raising events, transfer of dead bodies for mass burial and treatment of injured Taliban in Pakistani hospitals are emerging and are widely available,” Isaczai said.“Consistent with the agreement of the leadership of Afghanistan and Pakistan in Tashkent last month, we urge Pakistan to help with removing and dismantling of Taliban sanctuaries and supply lines and establish with us a joint monitoring and verification mechanism to make the fight against terrorism and international efforts for peace effective and credible,” he added.Barbara Woodward, the UK envoy to the UN, said the Taliban must realise there will be consequences if it continues its military offensive. “There can be no military solution to this conflict. For our part, the UK will not recognise a Taliban government that comes to power by force,” she said.The US representative condemned the increase in violent attacks and said: “The Taliban must hear from the international community that we will not accept a military takeover of Afghanistan or a return of the Taliban’s Islamic emirate. The Taliban will be isolated and an international pariah if they choose that path, which would most certainly push the country to further violence and destruction.”The US representative listed five principles for a negotiated and inclusive solution, including inclusive governance, the right of the Afghan people to elect political leaders, protection of human rights, a commitment to counter-terrorism and no safe havens for foreign terrorists, and adherence to international and humanitarian laws.Special representative Deborah Lyons asked the Security Council to issue an unambiguous statement calling for cessation of attacks on cities, and countries in contact with the Taliban’s political commission should insist on a ceasefire and a resumption of negotiations. The exemptions to the UN travel ban on Taliban leaders is for the sole purpose of peace negotiations, and further extension during a review on September 20 “must be predicated on real progress in peace”, she said.Following the statements by the 15 members of the Security Council, the meeting was adjourned for consultations behind closed doors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dangerous-turning-point-taliban-hammered-at-unsc-meet-on-afghanistan-101628272500408.html

The family stopped to enjoy the scenic beauty of the area when their car started to begin towards the edge of the cliff, according to a report by news agency Daily Mail.The car was parked at a popular tourist spot overlooking a valley. The video posted by news agency Daily Mail shows that the driver stepped out of the car to take a sip of his drink when the vehicle started moving forward. As the driver tried to stop the car from rolling down the cliff an older woman and a young boy managed to get out of the back seat. According to another report by news agency the Sun, a woman in the front seat was unable to exit the vehicle and was stuck inside the car as it plunged off the cliff.The Hejing County Emergency Management Bureau later said that the woman who was trapped inside the car managed to survive the plunge with hip injuries. The reason as to why the car started moving in the first place is still unclear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/car-plunges-off-cliff-family-manages-to-get-out-in-nick-of-time-1-injured-101628270269902.html
06-08-2021||World||Afghan war has entered 'deadlier, more destructive phase', UN says||The UN special envoy for Afghanistan on Friday questioned the Taliban's commitment to a political settlement, telling the UN Security Council the war has entered a "deadlier and more destructive phase" with more than 1,000 civilians killed in the past month during a Taliban offensive."A party that was genuinely committed to a negotiated settlement would not risk so many civilian casualties, because it would understand that the process of reconciliation will be more challenging, the more blood is shed," Deborah Lyons said.The Taliban have stepped up their campaign to defeat the US-backed government since April as foreign forces complete their withdrawal after 20 years of war. The Taliban captured an Afghan provincial capital and assassinated the government's top media officer in Kabul on Friday."This is now a different kind of war, reminiscent of Syria, recently, or Sarajevo, in the not-so-distant past," Lyons said."To attack urban areas is to knowingly inflict enormous harm and cause massive civilian casualties. Nonetheless, the threatening of large urban areas appears to be a strategic decision by the Taliban, who have accepted the likely carnage that will ensue," she said.Peace talks between the Afghan government and Taliban negotiators started last year in the Qatari capital of Doha, but have not made any substantive progress.Russia's UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council that the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan was of increasing concern and "with the withdrawal of foreign forces, the outlook looks grim."It is clear that there is no military solution to the Afghan situation, but in the current situation - given the absence of progress on the negotiation track - the prospects of Afghanistan slipping into full scale and protracted civil war, unfortunately, is a stark reality," he said.Senior US diplomat Jeffrey DeLaurentis urged the Taliban to halt their offensive, pursue a political settlement and protect Afghanistan's infrastructure and people."The Taliban must hear from the international community that we will not accept a military takeover of Afghanistan or a return of the Taliban's Islamic Emirate," he said.Afghanistan's UN Ambassador Ghulam Isaczai urged the Security Council to act to "prevent a catastrophic situation.""We're alarmed by reports and incidents of gross human rights violation by the Taliban and their foreign terrorist associates in almost half of our country and we are extremely concerned about the safety and security of people in cities under Taliban attacks," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-war-has-entered-deadlier-more-destructive-phase-un-says-101628267800255.html
06-08-2021||World||Time for ‘actions’, India tells UNSC on Afghanistan||India told the UN Security Council (UNSC) on Friday the time has come for it to “decide on actions” to bring a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire and ensure an immediate cessation of violence in Afghanistan, which, it warned, posed a “serious threat” to regional peace and security.Participating in a UNSC briefing on Afghanistan, India also told the council that for the sake of enduring peace in Afghanistan all “terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries in the region must be dismantled immediately”. This is usually a pointer to Pakistan’s continued support of terrorism and terrorists.This was the first discussion on Afghanistan on India’s watch as the rotational president of the Security Council for August, and came just a few days after the body strongly condemned escalating violence perpetrated by the resurgent Taliban and reiterated its opposition to restoration of the “Islamic Emirate”, as the 1996-2001 Taliban-ruled country was called.Deborah Lyons, the special representative of the secretary-general for Afghanistan and head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), briefed the members on the security situation in the country, whose new Permanent Representative, Ghulam M Isaczai, also participated in the briefing, which was followed by a closed-door consultation of the body.Citing recent escalation in violence including an attack on the UN compound in Herat, TS Tirumurti, the Indian permanent representative to the UN, said, “It is, therefore, time for the international community and, in particular, this council to take stock of the situation, and decide on actions that would help bring a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire and ensure an immediate cessation of violence.”He added: “Anything short of this will constitute a serious threat to regional peace and security.”The permanent representative reiterated India’s support for negotiations as the only way forward, but for it to be successful, he said, “it is necessary to ensure that the Taliban engage in negotiations in good faith, eschew the path of violence, severe ties with the al-Qaeda and other terrorist organisations, and fully commit itself towards reaching a political solution”.Talks, meanwhile, have stalled. The Taliban have moved swiftly, instead, in recent weeks to expand their military influence in Afghanistan as US-led international forces pull out of the country according to a timetable announced by President Joe Biden. The Taliban have “captured more territory in the last two months than during any other period since the US invasion in 2001”, the UNSC said in a scene-setter note for the Friday meeting. It added that the Taliban now control more than half of the districts in Afghanistan.It further noted that the Taliban’s territorial gains have been “accompanied by a dramatic surge in violence and human rights violations”. The total number of civilians killed and injured in Afghanistan between January 1 and June 30 increased by 47%, compared with the first half of 2020, the UN mission on Afghanistan said on July 26.Tirumurti has also renewed India’s call for tackling terrorism in the region. “For enduring peace in Afghanistan, terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries in the region must be dismantled immediately and terrorist supply chains disrupted. It needs to be ensured that Afghanistan’s neighbours and the region are not threatened by terrorism, separatism and extremism. There needs to be zero tolerance for terrorism in all its manifestations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-for-actions-india-tells-unsc-on-afghanistan-101628268300036.html

The woman has filed the criminal complaint days after a team of independent investigators appointed by New York Attorney General Letitia James found that the Democratic governor sexually harassed multiple former and current state employees.The woman has been identified in the report as ‘Executive Assistant #1’. According to the report, Cuomo engaged in a pattern of inappropriate conduct with the assistant, including intimate hugs, at least one kiss on the lips, and touching her butt during hugs. Over time, the report said, Cuomo's behaviour escalated to more intimate physical contact, culminating in an incident where the governor reached under her “blouse and grabbed her breast.”The woman kept the groping incident to herself for over three months until her emotional outburst became visible to her colleagues when the governor claimed at a press conference that he had never “touched anyone inappropriately”, according to the report. She then confided to some of her colleagues about the alleged sexual harassment.Also Read | New York governor Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women, probe findsCuomo, who has vehemently denied the allegations, is facing possible criminal investigations in four New York counties as the damning report found the governor sexually harassed 11 women. The 165-page long report revealed that Cuomo’s “sexually harassing behaviour” was not limited to members of his own staff but extended to other State employees.The calls for Cuomo’s resignation have intensified after the report was published earlier this week. "I think he should resign. I understand that the state legislature may decide to impeach. I don't know that for a fact," US President Joe Biden said Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cuomos-ex-staffer-who-accused-him-of-groping-files-criminal-complaint-with-albany-sheriff-101628267124759.html
06-08-2021||World||Schools reopen with masks optional in many US classrooms||As Tussahaw Elementary opened this week for a new school year, teary-eyed mothers led in kindergartners dwarfed by backpacks and buses dropped off fifth graders looking forward to ruling their school. The biggest clue to the lingering COVID-19 crisis was the masks worn by students and teachers — but not all of them.Georgia, like most states, is leaving it up to local schools to decide whether to require face coverings. And 43,000-student Henry County, like many districts worn out by months of conflict over masks, has decided not to insist on them.Instead, they are “highly recommended.”Many parents Wednesday in this suburb south of Atlanta had mixed feelings about the policy. Some kept their children home in disagreement with it. Others sent their youngsters to class with face coverings.Shatavia Dorsey, the mother of a kindergartner and a fifth grader, said her children are going to wear their masks at school regardless of the rules.“They’re not vaccinated because they’re too young, and I don’t know if someone else is carrying it in,” said Dorsey, who is doubtful about the school system's ability to maintain in-person instruction amid rising infections.With the delta variant spreading rapidly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics have advised in recent weeks that everyone in schools wear masks in communities with substantial or high transmission.Educators have had to contend with strong resistance to masks from some parents and political leaders. Some consider mask rules an intrusion on parents' authority to make decisions about their children’s health.California, Louisiana, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington state intend to require masks for all students and teachers regardless of vaccination status. At the other end of the spectrum, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah have banned mask requirements in public schools.Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said Thursday the decision of whether to wear masks in school should be made by parents, adding: “What are the harmful effects of putting a kindergartener in a mask for seven hours? Have they talked about the emotional, the academic, the physiological? Why isn’t CDC studying that?”Outbreaks that have hit schools at the very start of the year have added to calls for more mask requirements.In Marion, Arkansas, over 800 students and staff members have been quarantined because of exposure since classes began last week in the 4,000-student district.Marion Superintendent Glen Fenter urged lawmakers to overturn the state law banning masks, warning that a “full-blown crisis" could lie ahead. And Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson expressed regret over signing the ban in the first place and asked that it be lifted. But the GOP-controlled Legislature left it in place Friday.From the beginning of the pandemic to the peak of infections in January, CDC data showed children 15 and under had the lowest infection rates. Now, though, school-age children have infection rates higher than adults 50 and older.Henry County recorded 111 cases of COVID-19 in children ages 5 to 17 in the two weeks ending July 28. Its per capita rate is one of the highest in Georgia and higher than the nationwide figure.Henry County Superintendent Mary Elizabeth Davis said she believes schools have learned how to prevent transmission, citing intensified cleaning, air filtration and use of hand sanitizer. The district is also offering its 6,000 employees $1,000 bonuses to get vaccinated.“We are highly recommending that individuals opt for a mask as an added layer of prevention, but we also know so much more today than we did a year ago,” Davis said, wearing an “I got vaccinated” sticker. “And what we know today is that schools are not catalysts for community spread.”At least 28 of Georgia's more than 180 school districts are requiring masks, encompassing more than 38% of the state’s public school students.At Tussahaw Elementary, more than 60% of students were wearing masks in four classrooms visited by a reporter Wednesday, though some had pulled them down. In only one room, where the teacher was also unmasked, were a majority of students without face coverings.What parents at Tussahaw really wanted was some normalcy — an end to trying to help children at home learn virtually, or cycling between in-person school and quarantine.“We weathered the storm, but it's a lot better being back in the classroom," Bryant Thigpen said after dropping off his son for the first day of fifth grade. He said he thinks the school system should require masks — "at least until the cases go down.”Daniel Denny sent both his children to Tussahaw with masks but said face coverings should be up to parents.“To each his own,” he said. “You take care of your household how you choose.”Kimberly Vining, a parent of two middle school students, strongly approved of the policy, saying it will make things much easier for children with asthma or anxiety about wearing masks.“I have faith in God and I'm not going to live in fear for a virus that has a 98% survival rate,” she said.Overall, 90% of Henry County students are back in person, while 10% are opting for all-virtual instruction or a combination of both.Holley Freeman's 8-year-old daughter, Kalani, is one student who will be staying home and learning virtually. Freeman said that members of her household have health problems and that with no mask mandate, it would be unsafe for her daughter to go to school.“I feel really upset that we didn't have a safe choice,” Freeman said. “I feel really upset that our community betrayed us.”She said her daughter took the news hard: “She cried all the way home and cried all night and cried this morning, knowing she had to go online again."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/schools-reopen-with-masks-optional-in-many-us-classrooms-101628262776781.html
06-08-2021||World||On the frontline: Afghan woman governor recruits anti-Taliban militia||Salima Mazari sits nonchalantly in the front seat of a pickup as it cruises through a rural district of northern Afghanistan; a popular local song belts out from a loudspeaker stuck on top of the vehicle.Mazari, a female district governor in male-dominated Afghanistan, is on a mission -- recruiting men to fight the Taliban."Homeland... I sacrifice my life for you," the song goes -- and, these days, she is asking her constituents to do just that.The Taliban have swept through much of rural Afghanistan since early May, when US President Joe Biden called time on America's longest war and ordered his troops home.Life has changed little in many areas the insurgents have captured, but in Charkint -- the ruggedly remote district of mountains and valleys that Mazari governs, about an hour south of Mazar-i-Sharif in Balkh province -- the stakes are higher."Taliban are exactly the ones who trample human rights," she said.Under Taliban rule women and girls were denied education and employment, but even after the militants' downfall in 2001 attitudes have changed slowly."Socially, people were not ready to accept a female leader," Mazari told AFP, her head modestly covered with a butterfly-patterned shawl, her eyes hidden behind oversized sunglasses.Also Read | Don’t trust the Taliban, says Afghan envoy to China- Targeted community -Mazari is also a member of the Hazara community -- most of whom are Shia Muslims, who the Sunni Taliban consider a heretical sect.They have been regularly targeted by the Taliban and Islamic State fighters, including an attack on a school in the capital in May that killed more than 80 girls.Half the district Mazari nominally governs is already under Taliban control, so she spends a lot of time recruiting fighters to defend the rest.Hundreds of locals -- including farmers, shepherds and labourers -- have joined her cause, at enormous cost."Our people didn't have guns but they went and sold their cows, sheep, and even their land, to buy weapons," Mazari said."They are on the frontline every day and night without getting any kind of credit or salary."District police chief Sayed Nazir believes the only reason the Taliban haven't taken over is because of this local resistance."Our achievements are due to our people's support," he told AFP, still smarting from a leg wound he received recently fighting the Taliban.Mazari has so far recruited some 600 locals to supplement the conventional security forces in the district -- including Sayed Munawar, 53, who took up arms after 20 years of farming."We used to be craftsmen and workers until they attacked our villages," he told AFP at an outpost manned by police and local volunteers."They took a nearby village and raided their carpets and goods... we were forced to buy weapons and ammunition."- Studies put on hold -Faiz Mohammad, 21, is another volunteer -- putting his political science studies on hold to fight the Taliban.He hadn't seen combat until three months ago, but since then has fought three battles."The heaviest fight was a few nights ago when we had to repel seven attacks," he told AFP, dressed in civvies and listening to mournful Hazara music on a cheap Chinese-made cellphone.In Charkint, villagers still have bad memories of life under the Taliban before the hardline Islamic regime was toppled by the 2001 US-led invasion.And Governor Mazari knows if they return, they would never tolerate a woman in such a leadership position."Women would be banned from educational opportunities and our youth would be deprived of employment," she said, leading a meeting with militia commanders at her office, preparing for the next fight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-the-frontline-afghan-woman-governor-recruits-anti-taliban-militia-101628246490674.html

Al-Qahtani, who holds the official title of special envoy of the Qatari foreign minister for counter-terrorism and mediation of conflict resolution, is currently on a two-day visit to India. He met joint secretary JP Singh of the external affairs ministry’s Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran (PAI) desk and exchanged views on the current situation in Afghanistan and recent developments in the Afghan peace process, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. Al-Qahtani will meet foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday. He also met Sanjay Bhattacharya, the secretary responsible for consular issues and overseas Indian affairs on Friday. The Qatari diplomat’s visit to India comes days ahead of two key meetings in Doha on the situation in Afghanistan. Russia has convened a meeting of the “extended troika”, which includes China, the US and Pakistan, in Doha on August 11. Qatar will host a separate meeting between the Afghan side and its regional and international partners later this month. Various stakeholders are looking to these meetings to help revive the Afghan peace process, which has been stalled for several months, against the backdrop of the Taliban’s violent campaign to capture territory and urban areas, including provincial capitals. In June, Al-Qahtani had confirmed that Indian officials were engaged in talks with the Taliban – a development first reported by Hindustan Times. He told a webinar at the time that he believed the Indian side is engaging the Taliban as the group is seen as a “key component” in any future government in Kabul. He also said that Qatar would not recognise any group that seeks to take Afghanistan by force. India too has opposed any forcible takeover in Afghanistan, saying such a regime would lack legitimacy, and backed calls for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire and the resumption of negotiations to find a political settlement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/qatari-envoy-for-conflict-resolution-in-new-delhi-to-discuss-war-torn-afghanistan-101628261399821.html

Israel responded to Friday's rockets with artillery fire into Lebanon.As the Hezbollah fighters returned from the launch, "a number of citizens intercepted them" as they passed through the Chouaya area, Hezbollah said in a statement.A video circulated on social media and broadcast by Lebanese TV stations showed a crowd of men gathered around a blue, flat-back truck loaded with rocket launchers in Chouaya, a predominantly Druze area of the south.The Lebanese army said in a statement it had detained the "four people who launched the rockets and seized the launcher used in the operation".In its statement, Hezbollah said the launch had taken place "in a wooded area totally far from residential areas, to preserve the security of citizens".Hezbollah said it always took the utmost care to avoid exposing people to harm "during its resistance work", and would continue to do so.Walid Jumblatt, Lebanon's leading Druze politician, urged calm after the incident. "We hope that we all exit this tense atmosphere on social media," he wrote on Twitter.Hezbollah enjoys strong support among Shi'ites who form the majority in southern Lebanon, where its fighters helped drive out Israeli forces that occupied the area until 2000.But its powerful arsenal has long been a point of conflict in Lebanon, where its political opponents say the arsenal undermines the Lebanese state and should be handed over to the army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-rare-challenge-hezbollah-fighters-held-after-rocket-launch-towards-israel-101628260722021.html

The findings come after concerns raised by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) over people’s infectiousness amid Delta variant spread.The variant of concern, first detected in India, is rapidly becoming the dominant variant across the globe, threatening the gains made by vaccination drives. In a report published by the PHE, scientists have said that vaccination will not completely stop coronavirus transmission even as they provide high levels of protection."Some initial findings ... indicate that levels of virus in those who become infected with Delta having already been vaccinated may be similar to levels found in unvaccinated people," PHE said in a statement.According to the report, the Delta variant now accounts for more than 99% of Covid-19 cases across the United Kingdom. Out of 1,467 patients hospitalised with confirmed cases of Delta variant, 55.1% were unvaccinated while 34.9% had received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. Also Read | South Africa may resume use of AstraZeneca vaccine amid Delta variant threatPHE warned that the UK will see a relatively higher percentage of vaccinated people in hospitals as the vaccination drive further expands."This may have implications for people's infectiousness, whether they have been vaccinated or not. However, this is early exploratory analysis and further targeted studies are needed to confirm whether this is the case," it added.The World Health Organization (WHO) in its latest epidemiological report said that three additional countries have reported Delta variant cases, taking the total number of such countries to 135.Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK health security agency, said in a statement vaccination is the best tool to protect ourselves from severe illness, however, they do not eliminate all risks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccines-may-not-stop-delta-transmission-uk-warns-in-initial-findings-101628254462683.html
06-08-2021||World||Iran President Raisi backs India’s role in establishing security in Afghanistan||Iran’s new President Ebrahim Raisi on Friday backed India’s role in the establishment of peace and security in Afghanistan and highlighted the need for a joint plan to elevate relations between Tehran and New Delhi. Raisi, who was formally sworn in on Thursday, made the remarks during a meeting with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who represented India at the inauguration. Jaishankar tweeted after the meeting that there is “convergence” between the two sides on regional interests. Jaishankar’s two-day visit to Tehran coincided with India walking a diplomatic tightrope in its current role as president of the UN Security Council following demands from Britain and the US for a discussion on a deadly tanker attack off the coast of Oman that has been blamed on Iran. At his meeting with Jaishankar, Raisi stressed the importance of close cooperation and coordination between India and Iran in developing regional peace and stability, according to a statement from the Iranian president’s office. “Iran and India can play a constructive and useful role in ensuring security in the region, especially Afghanistan, and Tehran welcomes New Delhi’s role in establishment of security in Afghanistan,” Raisi said. The fate of Afghanistan, Raisi said, “must be decided by the Afghans themselves”. He contended that “if the Americans do not sabotage the situation, this issue will be resolved quickly”. Iran attaches “special importance” to extensive relations with India, and there is a need for a “joint cooperation programme” to elevate bilateral ties, Raisi said. “From today on, we should take new and distinct steps in the development of bilateral, regional and international relations with a new perspective,” he said. “By moving in the direction of a joint cooperation programme, we can take steps to bring about different conditions at the level of relations between the two countries in the interests of the two nations,” he added. Raisi said the Iranian government will pursue a policy of developing ties with neighbouring countries and the region, especially India. “There are various sectors, especially in the economic and commercial fields, as well as new technologies, that we should use to promote the level of our relations,” he added. Jaishankar tweeted that he had a “warm meeting” with Raisi, during which he conveyed the personal greetings of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “His commitment to strengthening our bilateral relationship was manifest. So too was the convergence in our regional interests,” he added. Bilateral ties took a massive hit after India stopped importing oil from Iran in mid-2019 because of sanctions imposed by the former Trump administration. At the time, Iran was among India’s top three energy suppliers. Iran has also been upset at the pace of development of Chabahar port by the Indian side. Recent moves by Tehran to develop a railway line to Chabahar and the Farzad B gas field without Indian involvement have not gone down well with New Delhi. However, two visits by Jaishankar have helped give fresh impetus to ties, especially at a time when the two countries have similar interests with regard to the situation in Afghanistan. Jaishankar was the first foreign leader to meet Raisi, then the president-elect, during a stopover in Tehran on July 9 while on his way to Russia. Iran ambassador Ali Chegeni said Jaishankar’s two visits to Iran and meetings with Raisi in less than a month “show the strong will of our leaders to expand bilateral relations and draw a very positive and promising vision”. However, the Indian side will still have to cope with the diplomatic crisis over last week’s drone attack on the tanker Mercer Street, managed by Israeli-owned Zodiac Maritime that killed two crew members – a Briton and a Romanian. The issue is set to be discussed by the UN Security Council amid claims by Britain and the US that Iran was behind the attack. Tehran has denied any involvement in the July 29 attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-president-raisi-backs-india-s-role-in-establishing-security-in-afghanistan-101628254859242.html

Gen. Wang Haijiang will oversee a massive military presence in the sprawling northwestern region that borders on several unstable Central Asian states, along with Pakistan and Afghanistan, from which U.S. troops are withdrawing.Like Xinjiang’s hardline Communist Party chief Chen Quanguo, Wang previously served in Tibet, which also hosts large numbers of troops to suppress anti-government sentiment among the native Tibetan population and guard the disputed border with India, where the two nations had a deadly clash last year.Wang's unannounced appointment was revealed on the Xinjiang Military District's social media feed showing him presiding at a retirement ceremony for senior officers on Wednesday.Wang saw combat during a border war with Vietnam in the early 1980s and served in an elite People's Liberation Army unit, according to state media reports.The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan is a particular concern for Beijing, which fears a resurgence of militant Islam along its border.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi last week hosted a delegation from the Taliban, which has been making rapid territorial gains in Afghanistan and is currently engaged in battles for major cities.Wang told the officials that China hopes the Taliban will focus on peace talks and work for unity among all factions and ethnic groups.He also said China hopes the Taliban will “deal resolutely” with the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, a group China claims is leading a push for independence in Xinjiang.Unconfirmed reports say several hundred fighters allied with the ETIM are present in northeastern Afghanistan, although many experts doubt the group even exists in any operational form.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-appoints-new-military-commander-in-restive-xinjiang-101628238951359.html

Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has a net worth of $198.9 billion at the moment as per the dynamic list which may change anytime.Arnault’s net worth took a giant leap after LVMH completed a deal with American jeweller Tiffany & Co in January 2021 for $15.8 billion, which is believed to be the biggest luxury brand acquisition ever. In 2019, LVMH completed the acquisition of luxury hospitality group Belmond, which owns or manages 46 luxury hotels, restaurants, trains and river cruises.The 72-year-old chairman of the world's largest luxury goods company was on the third position on Forbes’ Billionaires 2021 list. He now oversees an empire of 70 brands, including Louis Vuitton and Sephora. Arnault has five children and four of them - Frédéric, Delphine, Antoine and Alexandre - work in corners of the LVMH empire, per Forbes.Bezos has slipped to the second position on Forbes real-time billionaires list even as the e-commerce giant, Amazon, thrived during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Amazon’s revenue grew by 38% in 2020 to $386 billion as the company saw a spike in online purchases from people staying at home due to Covid-19 restrictions. Bezos recently went to space on his space company’s Blue Origin’s suborbital flight.Tesla’s Elon Musk holds the third spot on the Forbes list with $185.5 billion. Musk was the world’s richest person at one point but Tesla’s decision to no longer accept Bitcoin pushed him out of the top position.Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg, Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Larry Ellison, Warren Buffett, and Francoise Bettencourt Meyers are among the world’s top 10 billionaires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/louis-vuitton-s-bernard-arnault-is-now-world-s-richest-person-as-jeff-bezos-slips-101628251083606.html

How could you expect somebody with the same thinking to fight other people who are with the same thinking?” he said.In the readout issued by the Chinese government after the talks with Taliban, Wang called them a “significant military and political force” expected to play a key role in Afghanistan’s reconstruction.Qaem told Reuters that he would prefer that China was fully behind the Afghan government but also said that Beijing was transparent about its engagement with the Taliban, informing Afghanistan before extending its invitation and briefing it afterwards. “We have faith in the Chinese intentions.”Qaem said China could ask Pakistan to build trust with the Afghan government, given that Islamabad has long seen the Taliban as the best option for limiting the influence of India in Afghanistan.China could also serve as a conduit for messages from Kabul to the Taliban, as it was at last week’s meeting - relaying a government call for a ceasefire and an appeal for an inclusive political framework, he said.China can also help in boosting trade and buying more Afghan products such as saffron, he said. “So as long as that is provided, I don’t think China needs to send boots.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-trust-the-taliban-says-afghan-envoy-to-china-101628249638947.html
06-08-2021||World||China warming up faster than the world: Govt report||Climate crisis is pushing up temperatures in China at a rate faster than the global average and triggering extreme weather events more frequently, a new government report said this week.From 1951 to 2020, the average annual surface temperature in China showed a significant upward trend, with a warming rate of 0.26 degrees for every 10 years, it said.The Blue Book on Climate Change published this week by China’s National Climate Centre (NCC) said that the last 20 years have been the warmest since the beginning of the 20th century. It also said that 9 of the 10 warmest years since 1901 have been recorded in the 21st century.The NCC is country’s top climate research centre and affiliated with China Meteorological Administration (CMA).Glaciers in China, the source of many transnational rivers, are also showing an “accelerated melting trend”, the report said, adding that China is a “sensitive area”, which has been significantly affected by climate crisis.“From 1961 to 2020, China’s climate risk index showed an upward trend, and from 1991 to 2020, the average climate risk index (6.8) in China increased by 58% from the 1961-90 average (4.3),” the report added.China has been witnessing higher daytime temperatures - this July was hotter than previous years and the second-hottest since 1961 - while precipitation nationwide in July increased by 3.2% compared with previous years, the Sixth Tone news website said in its report, quoting the Blue Book.Sea levels off China’s coastal areas are rising as well at a worrying pace. “From 1980 to 2020, the rate of sea level rise along China’s coast was 3.4 mm per year, higher than the global average for the same period. In 2020, sea levels along China’s coast will be 73 mm higher than the 1993-2011 average, the third-highest level since 1980,” the report added.The report added that the incidence of extreme weather events such as high temperature and heavy precipitation has increased.From 1961 to 2020, the number of extreme heavy precipitation events in China had increased, it said, adding that the number of extreme low temperature events decreased.“… and the number of extreme high temperature events increased significantly since the mid-1990s, and the average intensity fluctuation of typhoons landing in China since the late 1990s increased,” it said.The CMA report comes within weeks of devastating floods in the central Chinese province of Henan, which killed over 300 people and affected millions more.During the floods, termed as an extreme weather event by experts, the provincial capital of Zhengzhou recorded a year’s worth of rainfall in a day, flooding large swathes of the city.The Chinese report coincided with a report released by Greenpeace East Asia on Thursday, which said “scorching temperatures are becoming much more frequent in cities across East Asia”.The Greenpeace report collated data from 57 cities across mainland China, Korea and Japan, which found that hot weather was arriving earlier in the year in more than 80% of cities.China is committed to achieving its major targets on fighting climate crisis, including realising a carbon emissions peak in 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality in 2060, President Xi Jinping said at the World Leaders’ Climate Summit in April this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warming-up-faster-than-the-world-govt-report-101628248138867.html

South African is currently using Pfizer-BioNTech and single-shot Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccines.Newly appointed South African health minister Joe Phaahla told a press briefing the government was planning to start using other vaccines, including Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccine."It was approved ... also that the AstraZeneca vaccine, which has now been shown to be effective against the Delta variant, that we should also look at bringing it back into use," Phaahla said.Earlier this year, the South African government halted the use of Covishield, a version of AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), after a study showed the vaccine provided minimal protection against mild to moderate illness caused by the Beta variant. South Africa sold the Covishied doses it had purchased from SII to African Union.Also Read | Majority of South Africans don't want Covid shot, many believe prayer more effectiveThe South African health minister’s remark suggests the country may consider using the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine again, given its high level of effectiveness against the Delta variant which is swiftly becoming the dominant strain across the world. A recent study of real-world data from Canada showed one dose of AstraZeneca’s Vaxzevria helped reduce hospitalisations or deaths by 87%.As Johnson & Johnson has applied for emergency use approval in India for its single-shot Covid-19 vaccine, its efficacy against variants announced by South Africa is encouraging. Glenda Gray, the joint lead investigator of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine trial in South Africa, said that the single-shot vaccine offers protection against severe disease and death.Gray told a media briefing that J&J shot, which is being used in the national vaccine programme alongside Pfizer's, offered 67% efficacy against infection when the Beta variant dominates and about 71% when the Delta variant dominates."Consistently after receiving the vaccine, there was very little death occurring in the vaccinated group as compared to the control group and showing a remarkable up to 96.2% protection against death," Gray said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-may-resume-use-of-astrazeneca-vaccine-amid-delta-variant-threat-101628245477961.html

06-08-2021||World||Canadian PM wants Covid-19 vaccination to be mandatory for all govt employees||As the Canadian province of Quebec announced that it will introduce Covid-19 “vaccine passports”, the country’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau supported the move and said he’s exploring the idea of making it compulsory for all government employees to get a jab against the disease.Saying that there were “no more excuses” for not getting vaccinated against Covid-19, Trudeau revealed that he has already asked Canada’s senior-most bureaucrat, the clerk of the privy council, to consider his plan for mandating vaccination of government workers.“We need to get vaccinated to get through this pandemic, particularly with all the real concerns around the Delta variant we are facing that is striking hardest, obviously, in under-vaccinated and non-vaccinated people,” Trudeau said. He added that his administration was looking at government-regulated workplaces “to encourage or perhaps even to mandate vaccinations for those industries”.According to an estimate by the news outlet Global News, such a mandate would apply to nearly 1.3 million government employees.The Canadian PM said getting vaccinated against the coronavirus disease was “no longer a matter of individual choice” but of protecting “the community and our children who haven’t had the opportunity to be vaccinated”.According to latest data from Health Canada, about 64% per cent of the eligible population is fully vaccinated, while over 80% has received one dose.The provincial government of Quebec had earlier floated the possibility of so-called “vaccine passports” within its jurisdiction, and on Thursday, its premier Francois Legault announced that they will be introduced soon to make non-essential services such as going to restaurants or using gyms only available to those who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19.Canada has recorded a week-on-week 50% increase in the number of new Covid-19 cases, with 1,036 reported on Thursday. This surge is driven by the highly-transmissible Delta variant of the virus, and health authorities say the new spike can only be countered by speeding up vaccination rates.Speaking at an event in Montreal, Legault said the passport measure was meant to allow those fully jabbed to have “a somewhat normal life”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-wants-covid-19-vaccination-to-be-mandatory-for-all-govt-employees-101628232357463.html

A release from the Indian high commission in Ottawa hailed the significance of the CDRI at this “crucial juncture as the world focuses on global resilience and recovery, following the collective global experience of managing the ravages of the pandemic”.Announcing the Canadian decision, minister of infrastructure and communities Catherine McKenna said, “People around the world are feeling the profound effects of climate change. From forest fires in Canada, to flooding in Europe to extreme heat in India, the impacts of a changing climate are real and significant. Canada recognises the need to join India and countries from around the globe to build a world that is more resilient to the impacts of climate change.” She pointed to the challenge thrown up by the Covid-19 pandemic, stating that the CDRI “has a significant role in this collective effort” for a global recovery.India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar had invited Ottawa to join the coalition and “welcomed Canada as a valued and trusted partner”, the release said.India’s high commissioner to Ottawa, Ajay Bisaria, said, “These partnerships will help ensure countries around the globe are better prepared to face international and domestic disasters of the future, including climate change, through mutual infrastructure and systems collaboration.”The CDRI describes itself as “a partnership of national governments, UN agencies and programmes, multilateral development banks and financing mechanisms, the private sector, and knowledge institutions that aims to promote the resilience of new and existing infrastructure systems to climate and disaster risks in support of sustainable development”.Among its members are the United States, the United Kingdom, The European Union, France, Germany, Japan, Australia and Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-joins-international-coalition-launched-by-india-in-2019-101628230497465.html

And after this deadline, these quotas will be lost forever -- under the existing laws, news agency PTI reported.If such a huge number of green cards is wasted this year, the rise in the quota will be of no use. This year, the quota for green cards was raised from 1,40,000 to 2,61,500, but the pace at which the US Citizenship and Immigration Services processed the applications, around 1 lakh will be wasted. The number has been confirmed by the department of state office in charge of determining visa usage.To stop this wastage, a group of 125 Indian and Chinese nationals filed a lawsuit which pointed out that in 2020, the pandemic slowed down the process and an unusually low number of family-based green cards were approved in 2020.Also Read: US lawmakers take another shot at removing per-country cap of green cardsA delegation of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community met US President Joe Biden and vice president Kamala Harris on Thursday and one of the issues discussed was immigration.“There are hundreds of thousands of gainfully employed legal immigrants in the US who would benefit from these Green Cards. Many of them have been waiting for a decade or more to adjust to permanent resident status but have been unable to do so due to a lack of available visa numbers,” PTI quoted Indian professional Sandeep Pawar as saying.Pawar has been fighting for the rights of Indian professionals waiting for decades to get this permanent resident card in the United States. "Most potential beneficiaries, such as myself, are from India, a country that is the most backlogged due to inherently racist and discriminatory per-country quotas embedded in the Immigration and Nationality Act. Many have spouses, mostly women, who are unable to work until they become permanent residents," Pawar said.Republican senator Mike Lee has recently said that the backlog of an Indian national to get permanent residency in the US is more than 195 years. Someone from India entering the backlog today would have to wait 195 years to receive an EB-3 green card. Even if we give their children this limbo status, none of them will have a prayer of becoming a US citizen," the senator said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-lakh-green-cards-likely-to-be-wasted-this-year-report-101628229349135.html

The change, announced by the department for transport, comes into effect from Sunday.Under the United Kingdom's traffic light system for international travel, returning from amber list countries means 10-day quarantining at home or any place of one's choice. "The UAE, Qatar, India and Bahrain will be moved from the red list to the amber list. All changes come into effect Sun 8th August at 4 am," UK transport secretary Grant Shapps tweeted.Indians can now quarantine at a place of their choice for 10 days after arriving in the UK. They will retain the option to Test to Release after five days of quarantine, reports news agency PTI.Passengers from India will now take a Covid-19 test three days before departure and book in advance for two Covid-19 tests to be taken upon arrival in England as well as complete a passenger locator form on arrival.After arriving in the United Kingdom, the passengers must quarantine at home or in any place they have confirmed as their location for 10 days and test on or before day two and on or after day eight.Those who are below 18 years of age and those fully vaccinated in the UK are exempted from home quarantine, so are those who have received two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine in the European Union and the United States.However, India-manufactured Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine Covishield is likely to be covered under this exemption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-moves-india-from-red-to-amber-list-all-you-need-to-know-101628220904346.html

New South Wales reported a record 291 cases, up from 262. One more person has died, raising the state total to 22 during the latest outbreak, all in Sydney.The dead person was an unvaccinated woman in her 60s who died in a Sydney hospital after contracting the coronavirus from a healthcare worker. There are 304 cases in hospitals in New South Wales, with 50 people in intensive care, 22 of whom require ventilation.Of particular concern is the growing number of people positive with the highly infectious Delta strain moving around in the community, particularly in Sydney's southwestern suburbs. Around one-fifth of Friday's cases have spent time outside while infectious.Officials in the neighbouring state of Victoria, which on Thursday night entered its sixth lockdown since the pandemic began, warned the state was "in a precarious position" as officials try to trace the source of several unlinked new cases."We have many lines of inquiry actively underway as to where these new cases have been and any further exposure sites," state Health Minister Martin Foley said in a media conference.Faced with another lockdown within weeks, an anti-lockdown protest erupted in state capital Melbourne on Thursday night.Victoria reported six locally acquired Covid-19 cases on Friday, down from eight a day earlier, with all linked but not in quarantine during their infectious period.In Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, the authorities reported 10 new cases, down from 16 the day before, and added that they were hopeful a lockdown would be lifted as planned on Sunday since all but two cases were isolated before testing positive.LOCKDOWN WOESMore than 60% of Australia's 25 million citizens are in hard lockdowns on Friday to try to contain latest surge, including the country's three largest cities - Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.Snap lockdowns, strict border controls and swift contact tracing have helped Australia keep its coronavirus numbers relatively low, with just over 35,600 cases and 933 deaths. But recent stop-and-start lockdowns amid a sluggish vaccination rollout, with only about 21% of people above 16 fully vaccinated, have frustrated residents.Australia has also enacted tough border controls requiring residents to apply for exemptions to leave and incoming overseas travellers, capped at around 3,000 a week, must go through a two-week mandatory quarantine.The rules will further tighten from Aug. 11 by removing an automatic exemption for citizens and permanent residents living outside of Australia to leave, a government statement tabled in the parliament on Thursday showed.The change would require all citizens and permanent residents living outside the country to apply for permission to exit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-spreads-in-sydney-as-australia-widens-covid-19-restrictions-101628222363167.html

The lawsuit was filed on Thursday in a federal court in Brooklyn, New York by 115 Gold Star families or relatives of American military service members killed in the war and relatives of noncombatants, claiming they “knowingly facilitated transfers of millions” of dollars that provided aid to terrorists in the region, according to reports.According to the lawsuit, transactions involving syndicate agents, operatives and fronts in countries including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Russia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) raised red flags that they were dealing with terrorist money.Also read | Halting Taliban attacks focus of UNSC meeting under Indian presidency“The terrorists used defendants’ laundromats to change dirty money into clean money and convert dirty foreign currency into clean US dollars. Defendants knew they were aiding terrorism and yet did so anyway,” they said in the complaint.The complainants include civilians, members of the military and families of people killed or wounded in Afghanistan from 2011 to 2016. They claim Americans were attacked by a terrorist syndicate led by al Qaeda and the Haqqani Network, an extreme faction of the Taliban.They allege the banks aided and abetted acts of terrorist violence against Americans in Afghanistan and that they aided and abetted a racketeering enterprise consisting of al Qaeda and the Haqqani Network’s terrorism campaign. The complaint seeks unspecified money damages which could reach into the billions of dollars.Also read | UNSC condemns Afghanistan violence, says it won’t support ‘Islamic emirate’They sued the banks under the US Anti-Terrorism Act, which was passed in 1990 and allows victims of terrorism to recover damages. In 2016, Congress broadened the law as it passed the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. This act allows suits against people, organisations and countries that provide direct or indirect support to terrorists that target the United States.According to The New York Times, the complainants say the banks’ treatment of some of their clients indicated that they understood how their services were connected to illegal activities.Also read | Afghanistan's situation will change in 6 months, says president Ashraf GhaniDeutsche Bank, the suit alleges, charged higher-than-normal rates to move money around the world for some of its clients, including a Pakistani man whom the US government had flagged as a money launderer for terrorists.

06-08-2021||World||China dismisses Republican report on origin of Covid-19: Report||China dismissed Republican lawmakers report which accused Beijing of one the 'greatest cover-ups in human history' over the origins of Covid-19, reported Daily Mail.Earlier this week, a Republican lawmaker's report investigating the origins of Covid-19 released concluded that the pandemic outbreak stemmed from a genetically modified virus that leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, first detected in December 2019.According to The Hill, House Republican lawmaker, Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released the third installment in his investigation into the origins of the virus and the missteps by China in alerting the world to the risks of the pandemic."What the US congressmen have done smears and slander China in pursuit of political gains," Daily Mail quoted the statement from the Chinese foreign ministry. "We express categorical opposition to and strong condemnation of such despicable acts that have no moral bottom line," it added.The Republican report is based on open-source material and draws conclusions from circumstantial reporting, also raises concern that the lab was conducting "gain of function" research, controversial medical research where scientists genetically modify a bacteria or virus to make it more infectious in an effort to study better preventative measures, in an unsafe environment, reported The Hill.McCaul also called on the House Foreign Affairs Committee to subpoena Peter Daszak, an American scientist who has come under scrutiny for his connection with the Wuhan lab and involvement in publishing an open letter in February 2020 that rejected the lab theory as a xenophobic distraction from the pandemic response.The letter, which was published in the Lancet medical journal, has since come under criticism as an attempt to divert attention from China's responsibility for the virus outbreak."Now is the time to use all of the tools the US government has to continue to root out the full truth of how this virus came to be," McCaul said."That includes subpoenaing Peter Daszak to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee to answer the many questions his inconsistent -- and in some instances outright and knowingly inaccurate -- statements have raised. It also includes Congress passing legislation to sanction scientists at the WIV [Wuhan Institute of Virology] and CCP [Chinese Communist Party] officials who participated in this coverup. This was the greatest coverup of all time and has caused the deaths of more than four million people around the world, and people must be held responsible."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-dismisses-republican-report-on-origin-of-covid19-101628212313686.html

"Let me be clear -- we have a zero-tolerance policy on this," the memo read, referring to the media organisation's strict stance on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-related protocols.The CNN memo, first obtained by AP, was later tweeted by media reporter Oliver Darcy. The organisation, however, offered no official details on the firing.Jeff Zucker adds in his memo to CNN staff: "In the past week, we have been made aware of three employees who were coming to the office unvaccinated. All three have been terminated. Let me be clear -- we have a zero-tolerance policy on this."CNN chief Zucker has indicated that there will be very little leeway for employees when it comes to adherence to Covid-19 protocols.Vaccines are mandatory, whether the employees report to the office or are out on the field (where they might come in contact with others), said Zucker in the internal company memo to his staff members. While proof of vaccination has currently been left to the honour system, that may change in the upcoming weeks, he said.CNN has left most of its offices open, that employees are free to attend on a voluntary basis. However, masks are mandatory in the Atlanta, Washington, and Los Angeles offices when people are not eating, drinking, or in an enclosed private space. Even in offices where mask-wearing is not mandated, people should do what feels comfortable to them “without any fear of retaliation or judgment from co-workers,” Zucker highlighted in the memo.The CNN chief's strict reminder comes at a time when the United States is dealing with rampant vaccine hesitancy, even in Covid-19 hotspots like the state of Wyoming. Viral videos of people having meltdowns over masks are commonplace, and in many parts of the United States, it is not uncommon for two complete strangers to confront each other publicly over the issue of wearing masks or getting a shot of vaccine.CNN is currently planning a company-wide return to the office on September 7, but it might be delayed until at least early to mid-October, reported AP, adding that more than a third of news staff members have already returned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zero-tolerance-cnn-fires-3-employees-for-showing-up-to-office-unvaccinated-101628210090944.html
06-08-2021||World||Hiroshima Day 2021: History, significance, and impacts of World War II atomic bombings||August 6, 2021, observed solemnly as Hiroshima Day around the world, will be the 76th anniversary of the atomic bombing of the Japanese city in the final year of World War II. On this day in 1945, the United States dropped the very first deployed nuclear bomb in the city of Hiroshima, wiping out an estimated 39 per cent of the population, most of who were civilians. Along with the atomic bombing of Nagasaki three days later, these instances remain the only recorded use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.Hiroshima Day: HistoryHiroshima bombings of 1945 were "necessitated", as said by the United States, as the Allied Forces continued to struggle against Japan even after Germany's surrender in World War II. In reports that have since been revealed, it has been known that the US administration at the time practically believed that the use of a nuclear weapon would force Japan to yield and save millions of casualties in the process.Also Read | Hiroshima, Nagasaki and Japan's surrender: Those 9 dark daysThe Manhattan Project, commissioned by the US, created two atomic bombs. The first one, called 'The Little Boy' was dropped in the city of Hiroshima while the second one, dubbed 'The Fat Man', was dropped in Nagasaki by the US on August 6 and 9, respectively.Hiroshima saw the terrors of the atomic weapon the moment an American B-29 bomber dropped it on the city. An estimated 90,000 to 140,000 people were killed instantly, while thousands more were hit with generational defects that are plaguing a section of the populace to this day.Hiroshima Day: SignificanceHiroshima Day 2021 will commemorate, like every year, the 1945 tragedy which completely destroyed the two cities and left the country to deal with a dreadful fate even in its aftermath. It reminds the world that all wars are terrible, and nuclear warfare even more so. It reminds thousands of politicians, diplomats, and envoys around the world that diplomacy is the only option while navigating geopolitics in the 21st century because only nine countries in the entire world currently possess more than 13,000 nuclear weapons.Hiroshima Day serves as a day of remembrance and a focus for anti-war and anti-nuclear demonstrations in several countries. Several people also take the time to visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum on this day, which documents the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in World War II.Hiroshima Day: The legacy of nuclear warfareHiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings of 1945 are an eerie reminder for the world of the devastating effects of nuclear warfare that two recorded instances in history left for humankind.Together, the two nuclear attacks killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people. Radiation poisoning, what was referred to as "atomic bomb disease", left people with an increased risk of cancer, birth defects, severe mental retardation, among other diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hiroshima-day-2021-history-significance-and-impacts-of-world-war-ii-atomic-bombings-101628207098035.html

It’s about everybody else also.”Fauci’s warning came as the US hit a six-month high for new Covid cases with over 100,000 infections reported on Wednesday, according to Reuters.The Biden administration is taking the first steps towards requiring nearly all international visitors to the US to be vaccinated against the disease.In France, a constitutional court on Thursday validated most aspects of a new law that, starting next week, requires people to carry a Covid-19 health pass to access cafes, restaurants and long-distance travel.

06-08-2021||India||Goa’s plan to throw open tourism after July vaccination deadline runs into hurdles||The Goa government’s plan for a gradual reopening of the economy appears to have hit a roadblock with the state now reconsidering whether to push ahead with its initial plan of reopening tourism after the July 31 deadline that it had set for itself to ensure that all eligible people are given at least one dose. The State Expert Committee that was constituted by the state government to offer advice on containing the Covid-19 pandemic is yet to take a final decision but has recommended several options to the government including mandating that only fully vaccinated people be allowed to enter the state without a negative test. “At present I can say only one thing, Covid-19 is still on. Even today the positivity rate in Goa is 1.9 to two per cent. There are one to two deaths. We need to take precautions,” Chief Minister Pramod Sawant told reporters in Panaji.“Kerala is witnessing a rise in third wave cases. We have made RT-PCR compulsory for people travelling from Kerala, even as people from other states are allowed entry with a Covid-19 negative certificate or a double dose certificate,” the Chief Minister said.The State Expert Committee has also said that if children above the age of two years are accompanying their fully vaccinated parents into the state, they will be made to undergo a Covid-19 test upon arrival while children below the age of two years will be exempted provided they are asymptomatic. The Goa government had set itself a target of vaccinating every eligible person with one dose by July 31 which the chief minister said would decide whether the state could reopen for tourism. Presently, casinos, river cruises, entertainment parks, are not allowed to reopen as also spas and massage parlours. However, bars and restaurants are allowed to open with 50% capacity up to 11pm at night.The Goa government is unlikely to reopen casinos and other tourism hotspots given that the viral infection still persists and despite nearly 90% of the state having received at least one dose of the vaccine.A Covid-19 negative certificate is mandatory on arrival to the state, except for persons who are fully vaccinated. However, tourists, and people arriving from Kerala will have to produce a negative certificate on arrival even if they are fully vaccinated. Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said that according to state records roughly around one lakh people were left to be vaccinated, but it is possible that those registered on the voters lists were residing out of Goa. “We had said that the first dose would be completed by July last week. One lakh odd people have not been vaccinated yet. I have sought details. Even though we have said that these people are left out, we go according to the voting roll. We have to check whether these people have relocated outside Goa. Some voters do not live in Goa at all,” Sawant said.Goa recorded 97 fresh Covid-19 cases on Friday and one new death taking the total number of confirmed cases since the pandemic began to 171,705 which is roughly around 10% of the state’s population. The state has recorded 3157 deaths, around half of which occurred during the month of May this year when the second wave was at its peak. At 97 daily cases, Goa’s daily tally is higher than much larger states like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi. While the number of cases dipped to below 100 on Friday for much of the week Goa has been recording above 100 cases with a positivity rate above 2% prompting fears that the state will yet again see resurgence in cases.The Bombay High Court at Goa is expected to next week hear the application filed by the Goa government to open its borders to people who have been fully vaccinated. The state has been pushing to allow those fully vaccinated to enter the state in a bid to reduce the hold-ups at the state’s borders since testing on arrival was made mandatory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goas-plan-to-throw-open-tourism-after-july-vaccination-deadline-runs-into-hurdles-101628273280328.html

Reports from Afghanistan said the Taliban had allegedly forced the custodian of Gurdwara Thala Sahib in Chamkani region of Paktia province to remove the Nishan Sahib or holy flag from the shrine’s rooftop. The gurdwara is revered by Sikhs as it was once visited by Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. Images of the shrine posted on social media since Thursday showed that the flag was removed from the gurdwara’s rooftop. “We have seen media reports about the Nishan Sahib on the roof of Gurdwara Thala Sahib having been removed. We condemn this act and reiterate India’s firm belief that Afghanistan’s future must be one where interests of all sections of Afghan society, including minorities and women, are protected,” a person familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. In June last year, Nidan Singh Sachdeva, a leader of the Hindu and Sikh minorities in Afghanistan, was kidnapped by the Taliban from the same gurdwara. Sachdeva was later released due to efforts made by the Afghan government and community elders. Before that, about 30 members of the Sikh minority were killed in a terror attack on a place of worship in Kabul that was claimed by the Islamic State. However, Indian officials said the Haqqani Network and Lashkar-e-Taiba were behind the killings. Afghanistan has witnessed a surge in violence amid the drawdown of troops by the US and NATO. The Taliban have begun attacking key urban areas and cities such as Lashkargah, Herat and Kandahar after capturing territory in rural areas since early May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-condemns-removal-of-holy-flag-from-afghan-gurdwara-by-taliban-101628272260290.html

She had wanted to meet them once and seek blessing for her success.At that point of time during her early training, local transport was very limited in her village. So the sand/stone carrying trucks which passed through her village in the early hours of the day on their way to Imphal from Etham Moirangpurel area often provided free lifts to Mirabai.“Those were the days when I faced a lot of hardship. So I feel like crying when I see the uncles and others here today. What I am today and can stand here before you is due to their help and support,” said Mirabai while thanking the truck drivers. “I’ve been requesting to arrange such a meeting so that I can seek blessings again for my achievement. I am so happy to meet you all again,” she said.During Thursday’s event, Mirabai honoured the truck drivers by presenting gifts as a token of appreciation. The members of the truck association of the area who were present during Thursday’s event also expressed their gratitude to Mirabai for remembering them after winning a medal in the world’s biggest sporting event.Mirabai, who won the country’s first medal at the Tokyo Olympics, became India’s first silver medallist in women’s weightlifting, and second only to Katnam Malleswari to win a medal at the Olympic Games.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mirabai-honours-truck-drivers-who-gave-her-free-lifts-during-early-training-101628271300225.html

The Army chief also said that he firmly believes that wars are not fought between two armies but two nations.His remarks come after both Indian and Chinese armies said that they completed the disengagement process and restored the status quo at the Gogra friction point in eastern Ladakh. Naravane was speaking at the golden jubilee celebrations (1971-2021) of the Television Wing of the Film and Television Institute of India.Naravane said that ‘exigencies’ at the western and northern borders have increased amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Naravane also started his two-day visit to production facilities of Larsen and Toubro (L&T) and Tata Motors in Pune, Maharashtra. He will be visiting Indian Navy's airbase INS Hansa in Goa on Saturday.While speaking at the event, Naravane said that Indian cinema and television have immortalised the role of the army. He, on a lighter note said, that he found the portrayal of Indian (armed forces) officers in the films slightly stereotyped in Indian cinema. “The beautiful heroine's father is always a 'khadoos' (rude, snobbish) colonel, wearing a silk gown with whisky in one hand and a shotgun in the other.

Initiated by Uttarakhand Director General of Police (DGP) Ashok Kumar under Operation Maryada, police teams have been patrolling and keeping a watch at the Ganga Ghats and temple premises on anti-social elements who often hurt religious sentiments and aura of places of worship. The DGP called for Operation Maryada after dozens of people were found smoking hookah, partying and creating a nuisance at night at Har-Ki-Pauri in July which created resentment among local priests, seers and the Ganga Sabha which manages the affairs of the sanctum sanctorum of the Brahamkund, Har-Ki-Pauri Ganga ghats, saints and local people. On Friday, on the festive occasion of Shravan Shivratri at Malviya Ghat near Har-Ki-Pauri, police caught 9 people who were creating a nuisance and arrested them under CrPC section 151. The arrested pilgrims hailed from Saharanpur, Panipat, Muzaffarnagar, and Mahendragarh Haryana. Circle Officer City Abhay Pratap Singh said that the drive has been quite effective to rein in such anti-social elements who create nuisance and violate the religious sanctity and dignity of such places. “A total of 321 people have been fined and 68 arrests have been made so far at Ganga Ghats. Even those who litter garbage or leave leftovers at the ghats are being sensitized and a penalty has been levied on 41 such people so far,” said Abhay Pratap. Ganga Sabha has lauded the impact of Operation Maryada urging the police to continue it further so that everyone gets the message that no such nuisance or undignified act will be allowed and will be legally dealt with. Ganga Sabha president Praveen Jha said that their volunteers through a public announcement system regularly urge pilgrims, devotees, tourists and visitors at Har-Ki-Pauri to adhere to decent behaviour and ensure the sanctity of the Ganga ghats. Dharamshala Raksha Samiti general secretary Vikas Tiwari has also called Operation Maryada a success pointing out that a stern message is going to everyone through the legal action being taken against such violators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/321-pilgrims-penalised-in-haridwar-68-held-for-violating-religious-sanctity-at-ghats-101628269740238.html

From May 1, every citizen aged 18 or above was permitted to get vaccinated against the viral disease. Vaccination drive for children, meanwhile, is likely to begin this month.Thus far, four vaccines have received clearance from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), of which two -- Covishield and Covaxin -- have been in use since the beginning of the drive. The other two vaccines to be granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) are Sputnik V and Moderna’s anti-Covid jab. Among these, Covaxin, developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International Limited, is India’s first and thus far only indigenous vaccine against the coronavirus disease. In recent days, other firms, too, have filed EUA applications with the DCGI for their respective vaccine candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-covid-19-vaccination-coverage-tops-500-million-pm-modi-union-health-minister-comment-101628268121581.html

Ltd; and Nalwa Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. and the residential premises of their Directors at Dehradun, Haridwar, Delhi, Noida and Hisar in connection with the fake Covid-19 tests carried out during the Kumbh Mela at Haridwar, a statement issued by the ED on Friday read. The agency has launched a probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on the basis of the FIR (first information report) registered by the Uttarakhand Police.During the money laundering investigation, it was revealed that the labs were given the contract by the Uttarakhand government for conducting Rapid Antigen Test/RT-PCR tests to detect the Covid-19 viral infection during the Kumbh Mela, 2021. “These laboratories hardly carried out any Covid-19 tests (Rapid Antigen Test and RT-PCR Test), but made fake entries for testing and raised bogus bills in order to make illegal financial gains,” the ED added. It said that an amount of ₹3.4 crore had already been received by them from the Uttarakhand government as part payment. “Modus operandi used by these labs was that these labs used a single mobile number/false mobile number/single address/ same Specimen Referral Form (SRF) for multiple people for showing the inflated numbers of Covid-19 testing without actually testing. Investigation further revealed that testing was claimed to be done in the name of people, who never visited the Kumbh Mela,” the ED statement added. “Due to false negative testing by these labs, the positivity rate of Haridwar at that time was shown at 0.18% against the actual 5.3%. During the search proceedings, the ED seized incriminating documents, bogus bills, laptops, mobile phones and property documents. Searches resulted in seizure of cash to the tune of Rs. 30.9 lakh,” it added. The agency said the searches were still going on in the matter till filing of this report. Allegations of fake testing surfaced at the Kumbh after a Faridkot resident complained to the authorities that he received a message for collecting his Covid-19 report despite never having been tested. The complaint triggered a probe that unearthed roughly 100,000 fake rapid antigen tests.Three firms – Lalchandani Lab, Nalwa Lab, and Noida-based private agency Max Corporate Services – have been booked under the Indian Penal Code, Disaster Management Act, and Epidemic Diseases Act by the Uttarakhand police in the matter. Calls made to offices of Novus Path Labs, DNA Labs, Max Corporate Services and Dr Lal Chandani Labs remained unanswered. An official at Nalwa labs in Hisar, who didn’t identify himself, said, “ED took whatever they had to. They also recorded our statements.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-raids-labs-in-fake-covid-19-testing-scam-unearthed-at-mahakumbh-101628267940062.html

Amid the speculations of a third wave of the pandemic which, according to many scientific projections, has already begun in the country, Dr Swaminathan dismissed fears that the third wave will be impacting the children most and said it is not yet time to let down the guard.Speaking to news agency ANI in Chennai, Dr Swaminathan said 65 per cent of children and adults have developed antibodies, according to the ICMR serosurvey. This data proves that children have also been mildly affected by Covid, though their infections might have been mild. So the assumption that children will get affected the most in the third wave as they have not been affected in the first two waves has no scientific backing as it is wrong to assume that children were not affected in the first two waves. "We should not be too worried about a third wave affecting children. There is no scientific evidence," Dr Swaminathan said.Also Read | 'If new variants are more infectious...': Virologist Gagandeep Kang on Covid 3rd wave threat"I know everybody is tired, everyone wants to meet their family, organise parties.

This is what maximum scientific studies have predicted. However, it has been said that the possibility of the third wave depends on several factors, including variant, Covid appropriate behaviour, vaccine coverage etc. Virologist Gagandeep Kang on Thursday said as long as the virus is getting a chance to replicate, the chances of emerging a more virulent strain than Delta remain there. Hence, transmission has to be stopped to stop the virus from replicating, Dr Kang said.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lets-be-careful-for-6-more-months-who-chief-scientist-says-variant-worse-than-delta-possible-101628259406984.html

When doctors conducted a scan of the patient’s brain, they found clot-like formations that did not reduce despite medication. It was only after surgery was conducted that the doctors detected that the white fungus had formed an abscess in the brain.Doctors say while inflammation of the brain by Aspergillus is common instances of white fungus forming an abscess, especially in Covid-19 patients, is extremely rare.A senior neurosurgeon of Hyderabad-based Sunshine Hospitals, Dr P Ranganadham, said while fungal infections have been found in Covid-19 patients who are diabetic, in this case, although the patient has a history of high blood pressure there was no presence of diabetes, according to a report published in TOI.“The paranasal sinuses are clear indicating that white fungus had not entered the brain through the nose unlike black fungus,” the specialist doctor said.Elaborating on the condition of the patient that led to the rare discovery, Dr Ranganadham, who performed the surgery on the patient, said, the patient complained of weakness in the limb and difficulty in speech on the sixth day following hospitalisation with symptoms of Covid-19 virus, at a time when the second wave of the pandemic was at its peak. A brain scan revealed a large lesion in the left part and two small lesions in other areas.The doctor said the patient was initially treated for haematoma, however, when another MRI of the brain was conducted it was found that the lesion had increased in size with dense and well-defined margins.The doctor elaborated that the smaller lesions remained unchanged in size. Following surgery, the doctors “found a well-encapsulated abscess containing soft necrotic material, separate from normal brain.”The medical team working in the case conducted a pathological analysis of the abscess and found it to be a case of white fungus infection, also known as Aspergillosis in medical terms.Dr Ranganadham said the Aspergillosis of the central nervous system was caused after the white blood cells of the brain were invaded by the white fungus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-white-fungus-brain-abscess-post-recovery-rare-symptom-101628257930209.html

Forest degradation has been going on. So we took a unanimous decision to save our forests by dedicating them to our Goddess Kotgari Devi,” said Bhagirathi Mehta, village head of Devalchora village under Bageshwar block. These villagers of Devalchora village in Bageshwar district held a meeting last week and expressed concern on the deterioration of water resources and illegal felling of trees in the forests near them. They said if illegal felling was not checked it would lead to many problems like drinking water shortage and increase in landslides in their village and surrounding areas. The villagers then decided that no activity such as fodder and firewood collection would be carried out in the forest for the next five years. They decided to dedicate the forests to the local deity Kotgari Devi. Later a delegation of villagers went to Kotgari temple and hung a letter mentioning their decision at the temple premises. Due to this people visiting the temple are reminded every day to protect their forests, Mehta said. The villagers have also put up colourful religious flags at many points in the forest to remind others that the forest now belonging to the deity. In another similar initiative, villagers of Dobad of Bageshwar block dedicated Vinayak forest to the local deity and decided that no villager would graze cattle in the forest till the planted saplings were fully grown. “We have planted saplings in the forest and we will take care of them till they grow to a height that no animal can harm them. Conservation of forests is connected with our life and economy,” said Prema Arya, village head of Dobad village. Dinesh Pandey, a social activist in Champawat said, “It is our old tradition in the hills to show love and care for nature by dedicating forests to our local deities. This practice has been in the hills for centuries. Hill peoples’ livelihood and the economy is entirely based on forests, so conservation of the forest is important for their existence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-villagers-dedicate-forest-to-local-deity-to-protect-trees-ecology-101628257439554.html

06-08-2021||India||Indian, Chinese armies disengage from Gogra, 6 months after Pangong pullback||NEW DELHI: The Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have pulled back their forward deployed troops from Gogra or Patrol Point-17A, one of the friction points on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), with the breakthrough coming after the 12th round of military talks held in the Ladakh sector last week, the Indian Army announced on Friday. The second round of disengagement, carried out on August 4-5, comes almost six months after the two armies pulled back their front-line troops and weaponry from the Pangong Tso sector in mid-February after the ninth round of talks. “As per the agreement (reached during the 12th round of talks on July 31), both sides have ceased forward deployments in this area (PP-17A) in a phased, coordinated and verified manner. The troops of both sides are now in their respective permanent bases,” the army said in a statement. Also Read | Stern message to China: Indian warships head to South China SeaAs part of the disengagement process, both armies have dismantled temporary structures erected by them along with allied infrastructure, with the actions being mutually verified. “The landform in the area has been restored by both sides to the pre-standoff period (April 2020),” it said. India and China have been locked in a border row for 15 months, a phase that witnessed a deadly skirmish in the Galwan Valley and saw tensions spiral between the rival armies on the north and south banks of Pangong Tso last year. The two armies kicked off talks to cool border tensions in June 2020. “This agreement ensures that the LAC in this area will be strictly observed and respected by both sides, and that there is no unilateral change in status quo. With this one more sensitive area of face-off has been resolved. Both sides have expressed commitment to take the talks forward and resolve the remaining issues along the LAC in the Western Sector,” the statement said.Former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd) said the current agreement removes a flashpoint from one of the areas and should be welcomed.“Hopefully, it could provide grounds for further disengagement in other areas. The real test will come when Depsang is discussed, and a breakthrough here could lead to a major de-escalation,” Hooda said.Top Indian and Chinese commanders had agreed to a speedy resolution of outstanding issues on the LAC at the 12th round of talks held at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC, with the dialogue focusing on disengagement of rival troops from the remaining flashpoints on the contested border. “As an outcome of the meeting, both sides agreed on disengagement in the area of Gogra. The troops in this area have been in a face-off situation since May last year,” the army said. A joint statement issued after the 12th round described the talks as “a candid and in-depth exchange of views on resolution of remaining areas related to disengagement along the LAC in the Western Sector of India-China border areas.” The latest round of talks was held following the meeting of the Indian and Chinese foreign ministers on July 14, in Dushanbe, and the 22nd meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) on June 25. Problems at Hot Springs and Depsang are yet to be resolved. To be sure, the problems at Depsang predate the current border standoff. “The focus will now be on resolving outstanding issues at other friction points,” said a senior officer. Both armies have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre and the deployments haven’t thinned after the disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector. “The Indian Army, along with Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), is totally committed to ensure the sovereignty of the nation and maintain peace and tranquility along the LAC in the Western Sector,” the army statement added. The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has been affected in Hot Springs (PP-15). The PLA’s forward presence in Depsang has also hindered access of Indian soldiers to routes including the ones leading to PP-10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-chinese-armies-disengage-from-gogra-6-months-after-pangong-pullback-101628252459289.html

I was hoping that he (PM Modi) will rename Rajiv Gandhi Khel Award after himself. I was shocked when he named it after Major Dhyan Chand,” a rough translation of Singh’s tweet, posted in Hindi, read.मुझे तो उम्मीद थी वे राजीव गांधी खेल अवॉर्ड का नाम भी बदल नरेंद्र मोदी खेल अवॉर्ड रखेंगे। इसी को अंग्रेज़ी में कहते हैं।  # MegalomaniaHowever, Singh was not the only Congress leader to make this analogy. Lok Sabha MP Gaurav Gogoi, too, demanded that the Narendra Modi Stadium be restored to its original name after Sardar Patel, the country’s first home minister. “Major Dhyan Chand has inspired many young Indians. Our current Olympic teams will continue to bring the necessary attention to Hockey. I hope the government will also award the Bharat Ratna to Major Dhyan Chand,” Gogoi posted on Twitter.Major Dhyanchand has inspired many young Indians. Our current Olympic teams will continue bringing the necessary attention to hockey. I hope the Government will also award the Bharat Ratna to Major Dhyanchand and rename Narendra Modi stadium to its original Sardar Patel Stadium.Earlier, PM Modi took to Twitter to announce that the country’s highest sports award is being renamed after legendary Hockey player Major Dhyan Chand. “I have been getting requests from many citizens across India to name the Khel Ratna Award after Major Dhyan Chand. Respecting their sentiment, the award will hereby be called the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award. It is fitting that our nation’s highest sporting honour will be named after him,” the prime minister had tweeted.I have been getting many requests from citizens across India to name the Khel Ratna Award after Major Dhyan Chand. I thank them for their views. Respecting their sentiment, the Khel Ratna Award will hereby be called the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award! Jai Hind! pic.twitter.com/zbStlMNHdqThe announcement was made just hours after the Indian Women’s Hockey team finished fourth in the ongoing Tokyo Olympics, going down 4-3 to 2016 gold medallists Great Britain in the bronze medal clash. If successful, this would have been the team’s first-ever Olympic medal. On Thursday, the men’s team had defeated Germany 5-4 to finish third, clinching its first Olympic medal in 41 years.The Khel Ratna Award was instituted in 1991-92, and named after former PM Rajiv Gandhi. The refurbished Narendra Modi Stadium, meanwhile, was inaugurated in February this year. With a seating capacity of more than 130,000, it is the world’s largest cricket stadium, surpassing Australia’s Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-was-shocked-digvijaya-leads-congress-charge-over-renaming-of-rajiv-gandhi-khel-ratna-award-101628250171650.html
06-08-2021||India||UP takes step to ‘disrupt’ Chinese monopoly in toys industry||The Uttar Pradesh government on Friday said that Gautam Budh Nagar is poised to become a major toy manufacturing hub with potential to challenge China’s booming toy industry. The government’s confidence is buoyed as 134 big industrialists acquired land at Noida’s Toy Park to set up their factories at a reported cost of around ₹410.13 crore.The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) officials also said that these factories will provide permanent jobs to 6,157 people. The construction of these units will begin soon, according to a statement by the Uttar Pradesh government. Some of the Indian companies that have invested in the Toy Park are Fun Zoo Toys India, Fun Ride Toys LLP, Super Shoes, Ayush Toy Marketing, Sunlord Apparels, Bharat Plastics, Jai Shree Krishna, Ganpati Creations and RRS Traders.The YEIDA officials said that companies like Fun Zoo Toys India and Fun Ride Toys are major companies who have the potential to challenge the monopoly of Chinese toy makers. The UP government, however, acknowledges that a massive challenge is to organise the 90% of the 4,000 micro, small and medium enterprises in the toy manufacturing business which are currently a part of the unorganised sector.The investment by major toy companies also reflects Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s desire to increase the country's share in the global toy business. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath aimed to fulfil that objective by earmarking 100 acres of land in Sector 33 of Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority area to push the industry.India's toy industry will be worth ₹147-221 billion by the year 2024 and the nation’s demand for toys is rising by 10-15% compared to the 5% global annual growth rate in terms of demand. India, however, faces the issue of the unorganised sector which exports toys worth ₹18-20 billion and also finds it hard to compete with China due to the higher cost of its products compared to theirs.Noida’s Toy Park aims to address the issue by reducing the cost of manufacturing of Indian toys while guaranteeing its quality. The Uttar Pradesh government claims that the toys that will be manufactured here will be high-quality, more durable and cheaper than the Chinese toys.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-takes-step-to-disrupt-chinese-monopoly-in-toys-industry-101628250008592.html

06-08-2021||India||34.4% prisoners got 1st dose of Covid vaccine, 4.6% got both: Govt||The government on Friday said that states and union territories across the country have vaccinated at least 165,108 prisoners with the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and over 22,345 with the second dose. The total number of inmates in prisons across the country, until February this year, was 478,600, according to a government answer in Rajya Sabha.So, at least 34.4% of prisoners have received the first dose of the vaccine, and just 4.6% have received both doses.In response to a question asked by Bharatiya Janata Party MP Aparajita Sarangi in Lok Sabha, the minister for health and family welfare Mansukh Mandaviya gave a state-wise list of all the prisoners vaccinated by the government. He said that the vaccination of prisoners is included and recorded under the vaccination of “Persons without Prescribed Identity Cards.”Also Read | India has administered at least 490 million Covid vaccine doses till nowThis, he said, includes “nomads, prison inmates, inmates in mental health institutions, citizens in old age homes, roadside beggars, people residing in rehabilitation centres/camps and any other identified eligible persons, aged 18 years or more, and not having any of the nine prescribed individual Photo ID Cards.”He reiterated that the Centre expected to vaccinate all eligible beneficiaries aged 18 years and above, including prisoners, by December 2021.In the state-wise list provided by Mandaviya, one of the states with the highest rate of vaccination of prisoners seems to be Mahararashtra, one of the states hardest hit by the pandemic. Of its 36,798 prisoners, Maharashtra has vaccinated 21,868 with the first dose and 1,183 with both doses--which means it has vaccinated 59.4% of inmates with the first dose and 3.2% with both doses.Uttar Pradesh, one of the most populated states, has vaccinated 24,230 of its 101,297 prisoners with the first dose and 2,789 people with both, which means it vaccinated 23.9% with the first dose of the vaccine and just 2.7% with both doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/344-prisoners-got-1st-dose-of-covid-vaccine-4-6-got-both-govt-101628249099018.html

That area is over 70% of Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand.The highest diversion of protected forest took place in Odisha with 14,158.34 ha of forests handed over for mining, according to the reply of the ministry of environment, forest, and climate change (MoEFCC) to a question in Lok Sabha on Friday. Odisha is followed by Chhattisgarh where 7,086.85 ha was diverted; 6,135.48 ha was diverted in Madhya Pradesh and 3,699.90 ha diverted in Telangana.“As per the order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court dated August 4, 2006 in the Writ Petition (C) no. 202/1995 (TN Godavarman Thirumalpad vs Union Of India & Ors) the permission for mining cannot be granted inside any National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. However, the mining activities can be permitted in Protected Forest (PF) areas by the concerned state government subject to prior approval of Central Government under the provisions of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980,” ministry said in its reply.Also Read | This July was 6th warmest since 1901, says IMDIn reply to another question on illegal mining in forest areas, the ministry has shared data on such instances in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Jharkhand. There have been 2,045 instances of illegal mining in protected forests of Rajasthan in 2020-21 which increased from 1,341 in 2016-17. In Maharashtra, there were 150 instances of illegal mining compared to 69 in 2017; in Jharkhand there were 546 instances of illegal mining.“Protection and management of forests is primarily the responsibility of concerned state/UT. Various actions to check illegal mining are taken as per the provisions under various Acts, such as Indian Forest Act, 1927; Wildlife Protection Act, 1972; and various rules made under these Acts and other State specific Acts and Rules. Further, to prevent and stop forest offences including illegal mining, various measures are taken by the state forest departments such as setting up of check posts, barriers, use of modern technology (that includes wireless networks, remote sensing, Geographical Information System, Information Technology, Global Positioning System and Differential Global Positioning System), improved mobility of field staff by providing vehicles for patrolling, survey and demarcation of forest areas and construction of boundary pillars,” MoEFCC said in its reply on Friday.Kanchi Kohli, a legal researcher with Centre for Policy Research said these diversions were not just about the number of hectares. "It is about the diversion of livelihood and habitation rights and obstruction for the movement of wildlife that creates new local and interstate conflicts. It is crucial that legal processes move away from treating forests and forest rights as mobile, tradable commodities that can be compensated for in cash or kind. Decisions related to forest diversion cannot be given effect without addressing questions of social legitimacy, ecological consequences and climate vulnerability," said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protected-forest-areas-larger-than-70-of-jim-corbett-park-diverted-for-mining-since-2011-101628248619091.html

Health minister Veena George on Friday defended the decision and said the government is responsible to provide adequate protection to the people and these decisions have been taken after detailed consultation with the experts. Speaking at the zero hour in the Assembly, the health minister said that these curbs were not meant forever and lifting all restrictions might cost the state dear.On Wednesday, the state government announced some relaxations of Covid-19 curbs doing away with Saturday lockdown. In its latest order, the government has allowed shops, markets, banks, offices, factories, tourist places to be open on all days from Monday to Saturday. But the rider that only vaccinated people or people with recent negative RT-PCR tests can enter these places has effectively changed nothing, many have alleged.There was confusion whether this provision is desirable or mandatory, but the state government has clarified that it is a mandatory provision.Congress leader K Babu said if the new order is implemented, then elderly people will have to go out as they are the ones fully vaccinated. Only 28 per cent of the youth have been vaccinated in the state, the Congress leader said.The health minister said the resistance to this new guideline is only to tarnish the image of the government as the situation needs close monitoring. Citing a recent Supreme Court order, Veena George said any relaxation to lockdown restrictions should be given after ensuring protection to people.The Covid-19 situation in Kerala has suddenly turned worrisome as the state is recording over 20,000 fresh infections for the past few days. With the lowest seropositivity rate in the country, Kerala has a considerable population yet to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The sudden rise in the number of infections in Kerala has sent an alarm to bordering Karnataka and Tamil Nadu as wellThe health minister has said high population density, coupled with lifestyle diseases and the increasing number of elderly people are major causes of worry with regard to the Covid spread in the state.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rtpcr-test-for-visiting-shops-is-justified-says-kerala-health-minister-101628247761713.html

Rupani, who was speaking in Surat on the occasion of "Rojgar Diwas," further claimed that more than 2 lakh people got government jobs in Gujarat in last five years alone.Also Read: Madhya Pradesh minister blames ex-PM Nehru’s speech for inflation, economic woes"The Congress did not have a policy or intention to eliminate unemployment and corruption in the country, and was therefore responsible for the rise in both. After he came to power, PM Modi took concrete steps to remove poverty and employment. He also introduced skill development initiatives so that people become job givers and not just job seekers," the Gujarat chief minister said, according to PTI. "Congress banned government recruitment in Gujarat while it was in power here. However, PM Modi, during his term as the chief minister, lifted the ban. Over the last five years, we gave government jobs to more than 2 lakh people, while more than 17 lakh people were recruited to the private sector in the same period," he claimed further.People used to ask former PM Jawaharlal Nehru to "stop giving slogans" if his government cannot provide jobs and employment, Rupani added.Gujarat, Rupani remarked, has emerged as a "ray of hope" during the time of the coronavirus pandemic. "As against our target of giving jobs to 50,000 youths, we are providing appointment letters to 62,000 youngsters from across the state today. This shows that Gujarat is a land of opportunities, and we invite people to come here to give wings to their dreams," the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said, adding that it is the Congress leaders who have become "jobless" today and not the youths, as people have forced the party to "shut its shop.""Rojgar Diwas" was organised as a part of nine-day-long celebrations to mark Rupani's five years in office. The BJP first formed government in the western state in 1995, and has been in power there since then. The home state of both PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, Gujarat is likely to vote for its next government in December 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/had-no-policy-or-intention-gujarat-cm-holds-congress-responsible-for-rise-in-unemployment-and-corruption-101628244406435.html

06-08-2021||India||WHO S-E Asia region has administered at least half a billion Covid vaccine doses||At least half a billion doses of Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines have been administered in WHO South-East Asia Region, with a majority of doses administered in India alone, said World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday, adding more vaccine doses were becoming available and countries were scaling up efforts to rapidly expand coverage amid recurrent surge in cases.“Countries across the region are making unprecedented efforts to reach more and more people with life-saving Covid-19 vaccines demonstrating their commitment to contain the pandemic at the earliest. We must continue these and also, stringently implement public health and social measures,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia Region.As of August 6, 618.5 million doses have been administered. As many as 146 million people have received two vaccine doses and are fully vaccinated.Also Read | Johnson & Johnson applies for approval of its single-dose Covid vaccine in IndiaThe maximum– 489 million doses– have been administered in India that reached 8.6 million people on day one of its reinvigorated campaign in June.According to Singh, Covid-19 vaccines are an important tool in fight against the pandemic as they are effective, even against the variants of concern, in preventing severe disease, hospitalisation, and death.WHO data shows, Indonesia, which was the first in the region to launch Covid-19 vaccination drive, has administered 71 million doses, followed by 18 million doses in Thailand.Sri Lanka has administered 13 million doses and has been consistently reaching out to 500,000 people per day with Covid-19 vaccination, recently.Bangladesh is scaling up vaccination, and also preparing to vaccinate Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar.Bhutan has achieved a coverage of 70 per 100 population with first dose and 62 per 100 population with two doses of Covid-19 vaccine, the highest in the region so far.Maldives has vaccinated half its population with two doses and nearly 60 per 100 coverage with one dose of Covid-19 vaccine.Nepal has vaccinated more than 70% of its health and frontline workers and elderly population with at least one dose of the vaccine.Thailand has vaccinated 84% of their health workforce.Timor-Leste has vaccinated almost a quarter of its 100 population with one dose.Commendable efforts are being made by countries. With more doses available in recent weeks through Covax, all possible efforts need to be made to expand Covid-19 vaccination coverage even further, the regional director said adding that nearly 90% of all vaccine doses available in the region have been utilised.“Countries in the region are administering Astra Zeneca, Covaxin, Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Sputnik V and Pfizer following emergency use authorization being granted by their national regulatory authorities,” said the WHO statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-s-e-asia-region-has-administered-at-least-half-a-billion-covid-vaccine-doses-101628237098171.html

The agency, monitoring seismic activity, said that the epicentre of the earthquake lay at a depth of 10km from Morigaon."Earthquake of Magnitude: 3.2, occurred on 06-08-2021, 12:46:48 IST, Lat: 26.44 & Long: 92.42, Depth: 10 Km ,Region: Morigaon, Assam, India," tweeted the National Center for Seismology.Earthquake of Magnitude:3.2, Occurred on 06-08-2021, 12:46:48 IST, Lat: 26.44 & Long: 92.42, Depth: 10 Km ,Region: Morigaon, Assam, India for more information Download the BhooKamp App https://t.co/5x2eQXf6cq pic.twitter.com/lUeIWGmJZ7No reports of damages or casualties in the incident have yet been received. The exact extent of damages in the Assam earthquake is not clear, either.Assam has witnessed frequent earthquakes over the recent months. The most recent quake, measuring 5.2 on the Richter Scale, struck Goalpara last month. The epicenter of the quake was located 71km north of Tura in Meghalaya.The NCS categorises the area as seismically 'very active', associated with Hazard zone V with collisional tectonics where the Indian plate subducts beneath the Eurasian Plate.In a written reply to the Lok Sabha last month, Union minister of Earth Sciences Dr Jitendra Singh said that 59 per cent of the total land territory in India is prone to earthquakes of various intensities. However, only 11 per cent of the country has been categorised as zone V, technically the most seismically active regions.Around 18 per cent of India is categorised as zone IV, 30 per cent in zone III and the rest of the territory has been categorised under zone I, based on the seismic activity.As many as 965 earthquakes of magnitude 3 and above were recorded in 2020, the central government had said earlier this year. Several cities in Assam fall under the seismically active zone V, including Guwahati and Tezpur, according to the written reply posted by the Union minister at the Lok Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/magnitude-3-2-earthquake-rocks-morigaon-in-assam-101628235660067.html
06-08-2021||India||Armed groups in N-E regrouping, says NGO; police reject claim||Armed insurgents group are regrouping in the northeast region, including the Garo Hills of Meghalaya, North East Dialogue Forum (NEDF), a northeast-based group dealing with conflict situations and human rights in the region has claimed. In a letter to Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K Sangma, the NEDF said regrouping of armed groups in Meghalaya, and the security situation in the north eastern states are matters of concern. The police, however, has debunked the claim and stated that few recent incidents were cases of some locals going astray and trying to make a quick buck. “We have credible information that armed groups in Garo Hills, Meghalaya, are regrouping and reorganising themselves and that members of such armed groups are moving in many parts of Garo Hills armed with sophisticated weapons,” Dr PBM Basaiawmoit, Consultant NEDF. Also Read | Hat trick for St. Anthony’s Shillong; Tops class 12 arts stream as wellHe pointed to the August 1 incident in which Meghalaya Police recovered a cache of explosive materials along the Umling-Patharkhmah Road in Ri Bhoi District bordering Assam as an indicator. The NEDF warned that with disputes prevailing in almost all bordering areas of Assam with its neighbours i.e; Meghalaya, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh and the NSCN (I-M) expressing anguish that the 2015 framework agreement with the Centre not being implemented, violence may erupt in the region again. However, Meghalaya director general of police R Chandranathan denounced the NEDF claim and said it was just some people out to make quick money. Even as he confirmed the August 1 haul where police arrested one person and seized 23 gelatine stick class-2 explosives (2.875 kg), 24 non-electric detonators and 9m safety fuse from Umdu village in Ri-Bhoi district, the police chief said, “We are aware of what is going on and from time to time, we succeed, like in the Ri-Bhoi recovery which was part of an ongoing investigation in which two persons were arrested in Tura on July 23.” Interestingly, during investigation, the arrested persons revealed their plan to use the explosives as improvised explosive devices in Garo Hills. “We are ever prepared...with so much unemployment and this pandemic, misguided youngsters tend to go astray. They’re just petty criminals who have nothing to do but create mischief. Still, we are not taking anything for granted,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-groups-in-n-e-regrouping-says-ngo-police-reject-claim-101628235237882.html

06-08-2021||India||UNSC meeting: Focus on Taliban violence in Afghanistan||The massive spike in violence by the Afghan Taliban and the role of the group’s sponsors and supporters will be in focus when the UN Security Council meets under the Indian presidency on Friday to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. The closed meeting on Afghanistan is the first item on the agenda of the Security Council for Friday. The Afghan government expects the body to take up two pressing issues – stopping the Taliban’s campaign of violence and attacks and taking forward the stalled Afghan peace process. The meeting, to be held at 10am New York time (7.30pm IST), will consist of a briefing and consultations on the latest developments in Afghanistan. India, which holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council for August, has consistently called for an immediate cessation of violence and a comprehensive ceasefire while steps are taken to advance the intra-Afghan dialogue to find a political settlement. An announcement about the Security Council meeting was made two days after Afghan foreign minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar called his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on Tuesday and sought an emergency session of the UN body to discuss ways to halt the Taliban’s violence and atrocities across Afghanistan. Also Read | Taliban’s strategy switch is in response to US strikes: ReportThe meeting was arranged following consultations with the five permanent and nine other non-permanent members of the Security Council, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. Though some efforts were made to gauge the possibility of adopting a resolution on the situation and the Taliban violence, the people said this might not be among the outcomes of the meeting. Afghanistan’s partners will seek to pressure the Taliban and its supporters in Pakistan, but the feeling is that China, a permanent member of the Security Council, will step in to counter any move critical of Pakistan. According to an Indian assessment, supply lines for the Taliban from the Pakistani side continue to be open and the group continues to get logistics and other support from Pakistan’s military establishment. There have been several reports of large caches of ammunition and new weaponry being found at Taliban bases captured by Afghan forces. During a briefing for foreign envoys in Kabul on Tuesday, Atmar had referred to the continuing links between the Taliban and groups such as Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Atmar said Taliban attacks were being carried out in “direct collusion with more than 10,000 regional terrorists” from LeT, TTP, al-Qaeda, Ansarullah, Jundallah, East Turkestan Islamic Movement and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. The Afghan side is hoping the UN Security Council meeting will focus on the Taliban’s violation of commitments under the 2020 agreement with the US through the group’s ongoing campaign of violence and attacks, and the support being provided to the group by the Pakistani side. “There is a need for pressure on the Taliban and their sponsors to reduce the violence. It is clear who is backing the violence and supporting the Taliban,” one of the people cited above said. The Security Council will meet days before two more crucial meetings on Afghanistan to be held in Qatar. Russia has convened a meeting of the “extended troika”, which includes China, the US and Pakistan, in Doha on August 11, while Qatar will host another meeting between the Afghan side and its regional and international partners this month. Afghan ambassador Farid Mamundzay, while welcoming the UN Security Council meeting, thanked India for playing a “lead role as UNSC President”. “Convening an emergency UN Security Council Session on Afghanistan is a positive development. UN & international community must play a greater role to stop the unfolding tragedy in [Afghanistan] due to violence & atrocities by terrorists,” Mamundzay tweeted. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India will share its vision and perspectives on Afghanistan during the meeting. “We are closely monitoring the evolving security situation in Afghanistan and we continue to call for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unscmeetingfocus-on-taliban-violence-inafghanistan-101628234818156.html
06-08-2021||India||Johnson & Johnson applies for approval of its single-dose Covid vaccine in India||Johnson & Johnson, the 134-year-old American pharma conglomerate, has now applied to the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation of India seeking emergency use approval of its single-shot vaccine. Earlier, the company had applied for a trial but as the Centre has now done away with the provision of trial for reputed and recognised vaccines, the Centre asked the vaccine maker to directly apply for approval. J&J then withdrew its earlier application and, in a statement issued on Friday, the company informed that on August 5, the company submitted its emergency use approval application."This is an important milestone that paves the way to bringing our single-dose COVID-19 vaccine to the people of India, and the rest of the world, through a collaboration with Biological E. Limited. Biological E will be an important part of our global supply chain network, helping to supply our Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine through the extensive collaborations and partnerships we have with governments, health authorities and organisations such as Gavi and the COVAX facility," the company said in a statement.If J&J's vaccine gets approval in India, it will be the second foreign-made vaccine to be approved in the country, after Moderna.J&J's vaccine developed by Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson comprises one shot and is found to have 85.4 per cent efficacy against severe disease and 93.1 per cent against hospitalisation.The US FDA authorised Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use in February 202. Now, the single-shot vaccine is approved in several countries.What has apparently stalled Moderna to export vaccines to India is the issue of legal indemnity as both Moderna and Pfizer had sought this legal cover in India. According to the latest developments, Pfizer has not allowed for emergency use approval and Moderna has got the approval but is stuck with the indemnity issue. If J&J's application is cleared, it will be the first among these three major pharma companies in the US to send vaccines to India. Legal indemnity might not be an issue as Biological E is the local partner of J&J."The EUA submission is based on topline efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 ENSEMBLE clinical trial, which demonstrated our single-shot vaccine was 85 per cent effective in preventing severe disease across all regions studied, and showed protection against COVID-19 related hospitalization and death, beginning 28 days after vaccination," J&J said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/johnson-johnson-applies-for-approval-of-its-single-dose-covid-vaccine-in-india-101628234289806.html

The work has begun on Monday which also faced the resistance of the local people. As Karnataka police deployed an earthmover on the Kotekar-Mariashram church road bordering Kasaragod in Kerala. Kasaragod Congress leader said the area where the digging was going on is in Kerala and that's why they protested.The sudden rise of Covid-19 infections in Kerala has spread fresh apprehension in Karnataka as Karnataka too is witnessing a spike since the last week of July. The case positivity rate in the state is around 1.10 per cent far below the danger mark, but the state government has already extended some Covid-19 restrictions. The bordering districts of Dakshin Kannada are at greater risk, while Bengaluru authorities have also imposed night curfew and Section 144 till August 16.This is not the first time that Karnataka and Kerala are clashing over border restrictions. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday said in the state Assembly that according to the orders issued by the Union home ministry, states should not close their borders. Kerala DGP Anil Kant contacted Karnataka DGP over border restrictions.There are 12 check posts in Karnataka-Kerala border where proper checking of entry with negative RT-PCR report can be done. People are coming to Karnataka frm Kerala through unmanned areas and that's why the number of Covid-19 infections in Dakshin Kannada is proportionately higher than Bengaluru, though the population is less, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-digs-up-roads-on-kerala-border-to-stop-people-from-coming-amid-covid-3rd-wave-fear-101628233096410.html

One of the seats awaiting bypolls is the Bhabanipur constituency from where chief minister Mamata Banerjee will contest to retain her chief minister’s post. She had lost the tightly fought Nandigram seat to her aide-turned-rival Suvendu Adhikary.Senior party leader and education minister Partha Chatterjee said on Thursday the team will meet the CEO “tomorrow and urge him to expedite the process of holding by-polls to five assembly seats and fresh elections to two others".A traditional Trinamool seat ever since 2011 when Banerjee stormed to power overthrowing the 34-year-old Left Front government, the Bhabanipur seat was won by the chief minister’s aide Sovandeb Chattpadhyay in the last election held in May. He will vacate the seat for the by-election to make way for Banerjee as the latter has to get elected within six months (November) of taking over as the chief minister.The Trinamool leadership had earlier met the Election Commission in Delhi over the matter, but the poll panel is yet to make any commitment on the election, mainly citing the pandemic situation. The ruling camp has argued that if an eight-phase election could be held amid the peak of the second wave of the coronavirus disease, there was no reason to delay the bypolls at a time when there has been a significant fall in fresh cases in the state. Adhikari has been saying that if trains cannot run due to the pandemic, elections too should be postponed.The poll body is reportedly making arrangements to hold the byelections in the state, but no date has been finalised yet.

The state government will distribute 10kg ration: 5kg free under Pradhan Mantri Gareeb Kalyan Yojana and another 5 kg for Re 1 in a bag. These bags have cost the state government ₹13.90 each. The state has 48.1 million beneficiaries and ration bags will be distributed to 11.5 million families via 25,435 public distribution system (PDS) shops. The bags have pictures of the PM and CM on one side and a special message from the PM on another side, said an officer of MP civil supplies corporation on the condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to talk to media. Also Read | MP floods: 2 dead, PM Modi reviews situation with CM Chouhan“The scheme will go on till November as per the announcement made by the PM Narendra Modi and CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan but the bags will be distributed once only,” the officer said. However, the Opposition raised questions on spending extra money on getting specials bags made. “Free ration is being distributed since April last year so why has the BJP-led government decided to distribute ration bags now? This is nothing but a move to clean the image which was hit during the second wave of Covid-19. They are trying to make people feel as if they are doing some favour by providing free ration. They are misusing power for their branding,” said MP Congress committee spokesperson JP Dhanopia. However, food and civil supplies minister Bisahulal Singh said, “We are working according to the will of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to help the poor. We can’t see anyone starving so we are going to organise Anna Utsav.” He added that the objective behind distributing bags is to popularise the scheme. “PM Narendra Modi doesn’t need branding. He is already popular among common people,” he added. In 2018, the BJP-led state government then stoked a controversy by introducing tiles with pictures of the CM and PM to fit in the houses being constructed under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. After a furore, they withdrew the decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-govt-to-distribute-free-ration-in-bags-with-pm-cm-photos-tomorrow-101628231697773.html

But Britain bounced back in the fourth quarter and won the match 4-3.WATCH: How the Odisha Model to Boost Hockey Powered India's Olympic DreamsPrime Minister Modi, taking to his official handle on Twitter, said: "We narrowly missed a medal in Women’s Hockey but this team reflects the spirit of New India- where we give our best and scale new frontiers. More importantly, their success at #Tokyo2020 will motivate young daughters of India to take up Hockey and excel in it. Proud of this team."We narrowly missed a medal in Women’s Hockey but this team reflects the spirit of New India- where we give our best and scale new frontiers. More importantly, their success at #Tokyo2020 will motivate young daughters of India to take up Hockey and excel in it. Proud of this team."We will always remember the great performance of our women’s hockey team at Tokyo 2020," the Prime Minister continued, "They gave their best throughout. Each and every member of the team is blessed with remarkable courage, skill, and resilience. India is proud of this outstanding team."Not just the Prime Minister, eminent personalities from all across India pitched in their words of encouragement for the Indian women's hockey team after the heartbreaking bronze snub."Heartbreak!!! But all reasons to hold our heads high," said Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan, who played the role of the women's hockey team coach in the film 'Chak De India!' 14 years ago. "Well played Indian women's hockey team," he said, "You all inspired everyone in India. That itself is victory."Notably, this is India's best-ever showing at the Olympics yet.

However, they managed to finish fourth this time, shattering all earlier records and showcasing their rise over the years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spirit-of-new-india-pm-modi-cheers-up-women-s-hockey-team-after-olympics-bronze-miss-101628223087663.html

A blockade of NH-306 on the Assam side following border clashes between the states on July 26 has only made matters worse for the state. The state, which has been under lockdown since April 20 to check spread of the pandemic, has over 13,000 active cases at present. The blockade by Assam residents has prevented entry of essential items, including medicine and goods for oxygen plant of Zoram Medical College (ZMC) in Aizawl. Mizoram health and family welfare minister Dr R Lalthangliana recently tweeted, “Consignment of Covid-19 test kits and life-saving medicines destined for Mizoram are being blocked in Assam...I urge the Centre to intervene.” The tweet was retweeted by Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga as well. Also Read | More severe Covid variant may strike, says top US expertAccording to the department of health of Mizoram, the state recorded more than 18,000 fresh cases in July this year and the first week of August is showing a rising trend. On Thursday 1,088 new cases were recorded found which included 167 children. Mizoram has 13,065 active cases and 28,861 people have so far recovered from the infection. According to state immunisation officer Dr Lalzawmi, more than 633,000 people have been vaccinated. The state has one RT-PCR centre in ZMC which collects sample from other districts of the state. ZMC principal Dr John Zohmingthanga said, “We are running out of medicine and other essentials due to the economic blockade in Assam. We are upgrading our oxygen plant from 300 LPM capacity to 1,000 LPM because the number is increasing and more people require oxygen. But essentials are stuck on Assam side...We have developed the infrastructure in past one year but now, we don’t have empty bed for new cases.” This year, the hospital has 307 Covid beds, including 34 ICU beds, against 140 last year. In June this year, 48 people died and in July, 52 people died due to the virus. The infection is increasing, according to the officials of the health department. Meanwhile, the lockdown has hit the small business the hardest. A woman vegetable vendor said, “We are selling produce such as bamboo shoots which stays fresh for a week or more. We prefer selling these because due to the lockdown, we get lesser time to sell.”Additionally, the economic blockade has reduced the quantity of wares as well because common people are not travelling from Assam anymore. Ministers from both Assam and Mizoram attended a meeting in Aizawl on Thursday to solve the border dispute but could not reach a solution to the economic blockage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surging-new-cases-a-blockade-on-nh-mizoram-going-through-worst-covid-phase-101628221316719.html

06-08-2021||India||Govt moves to disallow MP's question on Pegasus in Parliament||The Centre sought to disallow in the Rajya Sabha, a question seeking details on whether the government entered into a contract with Israeli cybersecurity firm NSO Group, at the centre of a global controversy over the misuse of its Pegasus spyware to hack phones of journalists, activists and politicians, stating that “the ongoing issue of Pegasus” is subjudice after “several PILs have been filed in the Supreme Court,” according to officials aware of the development and documents reviewed by HT.The Centre wrote to the Rajya Sabha secretariat earlier this week seeking that a “Provisionally Admitted Question”(PAQ) asked by CPI MP Binoy Viswam scheduled to be answered on August 12 in the upper house, not be allowed.“I have been informed informally that my question was disallowed but I am yet to get a formal response... the Government is misusing Rajya Sabha rules and taking an alien stand on truth. They must face questions on the issue of the Pegasus,” said Viswam.In his “Provisionally Admitted Question”(PAQ), reviewed by HT, with the subject ‘Government of India MoU with Foreign Companies,’ Viswam asked: “Will the Minister of External Affairs be pleased to state (a) the number of MoUs Government has entered into with foreign companies, the details sector-wise; (b) whether any of these MoU’s with foreign companies has been in order to curb terror activities through cyber security, the details of the same; and (c) whether Government has entered into a MoU with NSO Group in order to curb terror activities through cyber security across the nation, if so, provide details thereof?”In the letter sent to the Rajya Sabha secretariat requesting that the question not be allowed, the Centre said: “It would be noted that Part (a) to (c) of PAQ seeks to know about the ongoing issue of Pegasus owned by NSO Group. On this issue, several PILs have been filed in the Supreme Court, making this issue subjudice.”It added: “According to Rule 47 (xix) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Council of States (Rajya Sabha), dealing with admissibility of questions, an admitted question “shall not ask for information on matter which is under adjudication by a court of law having jurisdiction in any part of India”.According to the Rajya Sabha website, the admissibility of notice given by Members in respect of questions in Rajya Sabha is governed by Rules 47-50 of Rules and Procedure and Conduct of Council of States (Rajya Sabha). As per Rule 47 sub section ( xix) the following are the conditions of admissibility of a question: “It shall not ask for information on a matter which is under adjudication by a court of law having jurisdiction in any part of India.”“It is mentioned in rule 47, sub rule 2 that matters that are subjudice are not admitted in the house,” said RS secretariat media advisor to the chairman AA Rao.The Pegasus row erupted on July 18 after an international investigative consortium reported that the phones of Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were among the 50,000 numbers from around the world that were potentially targeted by the Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software. NSO says its software is sold only to government customers. The Indian government has neither confirmed nor denied that it used Pegasus and has ruled out any illegal surveillance.PDT Acharya, a former Lok Sabha general secretary said: “There have been occasions when the speaker decided that if the matter is of great public interest, even if it is subjudice, the House can discuss it... there is no external pressure on the house. The house has imposed the restriction on itself and this position has changed over a period of time... ‘subjudice’ as such has lost much of its rigour. The house has been as such liberal and they look at the importance and public interest.” “You cannot mechanically apply the rule to all subjudice matter. If public interest demands there should be discussion in the house.”“Questions submitted by MPs go through two levels of scrutiny to check that they comply with the rules of Parliament. First, the parliament secretariat makes sure that the questions that MPs are raising conform with the parliamentary guidelines. The ministry answering the question also checks the adherence to rules for the questions...,” said Chakshu Roy, head of Outreach, PRS Legislative Research. “In the budget session, out of the 330,00 questions that MPs submitted, approximately 2,000, that is about 6%, were disallowed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-moves-to-disallow-mp-s-parliament-question-on-engaging-nso-101628209883453.html

06-08-2021||India||Is Covid-19 holding back the economy or demand?||GDP data for the quarter ending June 2021 will be released on August 31. But most high frequency indicators suggest that the Indian economy managed a V-shaped recovery after the disruption of the second wave. The question at hand is not whether the economy has come back to the level where it was before the second wave of Covid-19. It is when the economy will regain pre-pandemic levels.There are two things which stand in the way of a holistic economic recovery: pandemic related restrictions preventing mobility, and therefore restoration of economic activities; and lack of aggregate demand due to incomes lost during the pandemic. To be sure, it need not be an either-or choice between these two sources of economic headwinds, as the two can coexist. Here are four points which can put this question in context.1. Has economic recovery slowed down of late?The answer depends on which indicator one is looking at. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI), which surged from 62.9 in the week ended May 30 to 86.3 in the week ended June 27, seems to have lost momentum mid-July onwards.NIBRI reached 96.4 in the week ended July 18 but has fallen marginally for two consecutive weeks and it was at 95 in the week ended August 1.Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing clocked an impressive 55.3 last month. July 2021 was the first time when PMI manufacturing recorded an increase in employment since the pandemic began. But PMI for services was at 45.4, making July the third straight month of contraction in services activity. A PMI value less than 50 entails a contraction in economic activity compared to the previous month.Services have a bigger share in Gross Value Added (GVA) than manufacturing. The share of services in GVA was 55.6% and that of manufacturing was 17.1% in 2019-20, the year before the pandemic struck. This means that a revival in services activity is crucial to boosting GDP growth.The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of RBI has projected a growth rate of 18.5% and 7.9% in the quarters ending June 30 and September 30. There was a contraction of 24.4% and 7.4% in the June and September quarters in the last fiscal year.2. Is a rise in Covid-19 cases slowing down recovery?Not necessarily. It is true that seven-day average of Covid-19 cases has reversed its falling trajectory in India in the last two weeks. But this does not mean that the entire country is witnessing a resurgence in Covid-19 cases.This is best seen by looking at India’s Covid-19 trajectory after excluding Kerala’s caseload.Once this is done, the pandemic situation in the rest of the country looks healthier. The seven-day average of daily new cases in India was 40,595 on August 4. This comes down to 19,986 if Kerala is excluded. More importantly, the number of cases excluding Kerala is still falling, not rising.3. Is a slow pace of vaccination preventing restoration of mobility?This is highly unlikely. By large most restrictions on mobility which were imposed during the second wave of infections have been removed. So there are no policy impediments to recovery.It could also be argued that there is a voluntary inhibition in getting out, and people are waiting for vaccination to reach a critical level. This also seems unlikely. A comparison of mobility levels and vaccination progress by states shows very little correlation.Some states are wild outliers – Bihar has the lowest share of population to have been vaccinated, but its mobility levels are the highest. The situation is the opposite in Kerala.4. This makes the question of demand an important oneWhat if people do not have the means to spend like they used to before the pandemic? Evidence of the economic recovery being profit rather than wage-led, a squeeze on labour earnings, and movement of workers from high productivity to low productivity sectors, makes this eminently possible.If true, this can create a vicious circle in the economy, where low demand destroys jobs and incomes, which then further depresses demand.Whether or not this is happening right now will only be known when the GDP numbers for the September quarter are released in November . However, findings of the latest round of RBI’s Consumer Confidence Survey (CCS), which will be released on August 6 will offer an insight into the state of consumer demand.Two data points will be of special interest in the CCS results: current perception on income levels and non-essential spending. The latter is important given the argument that rise in prices of essential commodities such as edible oil and petrol-diesel have put a squeeze on household budgets.RBI’s monetary policy committee (MPC), would have had a look at the results of CCS and other forward-looking surveys before everyone else, and it remains to be seen whether it keeps the June projection of 9.5% GDP growth unchanged or not in its Friday announcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-covid-19-holding-back-the-economy-or-demand-101628197117942.html
06-08-2021||India||Twitter not engaged in anti-national work: Govt||Twitter has not engaged in any anti-national activity and no FIR has been filed against the social media company as the “public order” and the “police” are state subjects, the central government said on Thursday.The Centre was responding to a question posed by Congress Rajya Sabha MP Dr Amee Yajnik on “whether organizations like Twitter had acted against the rules in recent times” and, if they had, what action did the government take against them.She also asked whether Twitter was engaged in any “anti-national work” or has any FIR been lodged against the microblogging site by the government.In his reply, Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar invoked the newly introduced Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, which took effect from May 26, 2021.“Complaints reported against Twitter are dealt with by the respective Law Enforcement Authorities of States/Union Territories. MeitY (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology) is not involved in the filing of any FIR against Twitter.”On a question about Twitter’s engagement into any “anti-national work,” the minister said: “No such action of Twitter is brought to the notice of MeitY.”The central government’s statement comes as Twitter has been in the eye of controversy over the past few months. On May 21, it labelled a tweet by Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Sambit Patra “manipulated media” prompting a Delhi Police investigation. The special cell of Delhi Police questioned Manish Maheshwari, managing director of Twitter in India, in late May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-not-engaged-in-anti-national-work-govt-101628193669054.html
06-08-2021||India||Confusion reigns in Kerala over revised Covid norms||Thiruvananthapuram: A day after the Kerala government announced its revised Covid-19 regulations making vaccination and RT-PCR negative test reports mandatory for shoppers and employees to access shops and markets, confusion prevailed across the state on Thursday, when it reported another high caseload. On Thursday, 163,376 samples were tested for Covid-19, of which 20,040 turned out to be positive with a test positivity rate of 13.49%. The active cases rose to 177,924. Kerala also reported 117 new deaths, taking the toll to 17,328, according to the state health department bulletin. In the last 24 hours, the overall Covid-19 cases reported in the country stood at 42,982, which effectively means the state’s share was more than 50%, health ministry statistics show. Besides, the state also accounted for slightly over the fifth of 533 deaths reported across the country on Thursday. As cases continue to surge, the state government announced a fresh set of pandemic control guidelines on Wednesday, much to the dislike of the trader community, which said the new norms will invite more troubles rather than solving their woes. Confusion reigned supreme at many places on Thursday and agitated traders asked the government to provide enough vaccine before enforcing such rules. “In the guise of minimising our trouble, the government perked up our difficulties,” said MK Chandran, a trader in Chala market in Thiruvananthapuram. According to the new guidelines, only persons who have taken at least one dose of vaccine before two weeks, or who are in possession of RT-PCR negative certificate taken 72 hours before or who are in possession of Covid-19 positive results more than a month old, will be allowed inside shops, banks and other establishments. This is applicable to both workers as well as visitors. Many banks reported thin attendance on Thursday. The Congress-led Opposition staged a walkout from the legislative assembly on Thursday, saying health minister Veena George’s announcement in the assembly and the chief secretary’s order on new regulations were contradictory. Leader of opposition VD Satheesan said the minister’s announcement in the assembly on Wednesday neither mentioned about mandatory vaccine nor RT-test certificate. “The government’s move to make these certificates mandatory to enter shops will add to the woes of the trading community and it will give more space to law-enforcement agencies to trouble them,” he said. Questioning the merit of the new guidelines seeking vaccination certificates, Satheesan pointed out that only 42.12% of the state’s population has received vaccine. He said the police were on a “fine spree” and new regulations will lead to a “fine raj”. However, the minister insisted that everyone will have to follow new restrictions in the light of rising cases in the state. Rejecting the charges of the opposition, George said, “We need strict measures. What the government has announced was accepted norms in virus-hit areas. There is no difference between what I read in the House and later came as an order.” Later, opposition members stormed out of the assembly saying her explanations were not satisfactory. After many flaws were detected in home isolation, the government has also decided to strengthen grassroots Asha and health workers to enforce quarantine strictly. The central team that visited the state also expressed reservations over the lax home quarantine. The latest genome study conducted by the Institute of Genomic and Integrative Biology (IGIB) Delhi has shown highly infectious Delta variant playing havoc in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/confusion-reigns-in-kerala-over-revised-covid-norms-101628193415127.html
06-08-2021||India||No condition to make me minister in Bommai cabinet: BY Vijayendra||Bengaluru Karnataka BJP vice president and son of former chief minister BS Yediyurappa, BY Vijayendra on Thursday said that his father had not tried to place any conditions to make him a minister in the new cabinet.“One thing is clear that even suggesting that BS Yediyurappa made a condition to make me a minister while giving his resignation is a black mark on his career,” Vijayendra said on Thursday.He said that it would “wrong” on Vijayendra’s part to even be an aspirant for a post in the cabinet as he was not an MLA or an MLC.The statements come a day after chief minister Basavaraj Bommai got 29 members inducted into his cabinet with no deputy chief ministers.People aware of the developments said that Yediyurappa is keen to placate his sons before he does eventually retire from politics after nearly five decades. One son, BY Raghavendra, is the member of Parliament from Shivamogga and Vijayendra is the state vice president.Vijayendra was also accused of running a parallel administration under the aegis of his chief minister father, which had been one of the major causes for discord and dissent within senior members of the party.Bommai on Wednesday had said that BJP national president JP Nadda had spoken to Yediyurappa and party general secretary incharge of Karnataka, Arun Singh, had spoken to Vijayendra on the latter’s possible entry into the government.There is also speculation that Vijayendra is likely to be fielded from the vacant Hangal assembly bypoll seat that fell vacant after the death of senior leader CM Udasi.Vijayendra, people aware of the developments said, is interested in the Old-Mysuru region where the BJP has limited representation and have to make inroads if the party has any hopes of returning to power on its own in 2023.Vijayendra has been closely linked to Varuna constituency, the former seat of Siddarmaiah that is currently represented by his son Dr Yathindra.One senior BJP leader, on the condition of anonymity, said that Vijayendra has been given enough preference and any further consideration of post has to be based on what he brings to the table and not only because he is the son of Yediyurappa.Vijayendra, one his part is now attempting to replicate his father by undertaking a state-wide tour ahead of the 2023 elections. Yediyurappa is also hopeful that Vijayendra is the seen as not just his political heir but also accepted as the leader of the dominant Lingayat community, believed to be the single largest caste group in the state.The BJP is trying to inorganically grow in the old-Mysuru region and have managed to rope in N Mahesh, the former minister and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) partyman. Mahesh is the sitting legislator from Kollegal in Chamarajanagar district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-condition-to-make-me-minister-in-bommai-cabinet-by-vijayendra-101628193354927.html
06-08-2021||India||Karnataka top cop bars officers from attending events hosted by criminals||Bengaluru: Following reports of the links between police and criminals, the Karnataka police chief has issued strict instructions forbidding police personnel to part take in events organised by those with criminal backgrounds. The order issued by the DG and IGP Praveen Sood on August 1, also instructed police officers not to organise celebrations like birthdays, wedding anniversaries and parties in police stations. According to senior officers, the circular was issued after the department received several complaints against police personnel inviting individuals with a criminal background for birthdays, wedding anniversaries, welcome and send-off events in police stations. Photos of such celebrations have also made their way on to social media, causing embarrassment to the department. DG and IGP Sood. in his order, also directed police officers and staff to verify the antecedents of persons or institutions before participating in the events hosted by them. If police personnel want to organise celebrations they should get permission from the higher authorities and it should be exclusively for the department officers or staff, he ordered. As per the guidelines, the police have been asked to revoke any friendly equation with people with a criminal background. “The police stations or other police offices are deemed public places. Hence, it is advised not to conduct any programmes like birthdays, weddings and anniversaries. On receiving any invitation for a public event, the police should do a background check about the organiser. The police can attend programmes related to awareness, curb crime or anything related to traffic. It is also advised for the police to stay away from any welcome or send off parties held during promotions or transfers,” the circular stated. It further added that no outsider should be entertained inside police stations and money should not be collected from the public for celebrations. “Police personnel must not forcefully collect money from the general public or from the staff for functions without the knowledge of senior officers,” the circular added. In Bengaluru city, the department had ordered the transfer of police officers who were found to have links with criminals. In an interview with the HT on July 14, Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant had said, “For the first time, we have ordered a general transfer of all ranks from sub-inspectors and below. You will not find any policemen who has served for five years or more in any police station anymore.

06-08-2021||India||ED raids properties of K’taka Congress MLA and former legislator in IMA case||Bengaluru: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday conducted searches at properties associated with Congress MLA Zameer Ahmed Khan and former MLA Roshan Baig in connection with the I-Monetary Advisor (IMA) Ponzi scam case. The IMA scam pertains to ₹4,000 crore collected by IMA Group from over 100,000 gullible investors in the name of providing attractive returns on investment. The raids are underway in multiple locations in Bengaluru since Thursday morning. According to officials in the know of the developments, the searches are being conducted by officers from New Delhi. So far, searches are underway at the two residences of Baig in Shivajinagar, and at the Chamarajpet residence of Khan, apart from the offices of National Travels, a firm he owns. The Congress accused the ruling BJP of using the central agencies to target leaders of Opposition parties. Several of Khan’s supporters and Congress workers wearing black bands gathered near Khan’s residence where searches are on and shouted slogans accusing the ruling BJP of targeting party leaders and questioned as to why the central agencies were not probing saffron party leaders allegedly involved in corruption. “The ED raid on former minister Zameer Ahmed Khan is politically motivated and an attempt by BJP to intimidate leaders from Opposition parties. I strongly condemn this undemocratic act of BJP to use institutions like ED, IT, etc,” senior Congress leader and Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly Siddaramaiah said. Condemning the searches, state Congress chief D K Shivakumar said it is an attempt to harass Khan, who has the capacity to face it legally, as he accused the central agency of discrimination by targeting only Opposition leaders. “About one-and-a-half to two years ago, the ED had issued him (Khan) notice and questioned him and he had told me that he had answered all the queries. When such is the situation, it is my feeling that raids were not required. Probably this is to harass him, but I’m confident that he will come out clean within the framework of law,” he said. Questioning as to why central agencies were not probing allegations against BJP leaders, Shivakumar claimed things are being done to their (BJP leaders) own benefit. “Is everyone in the BJP clean? Are their businesses and transaction pure...there is a lot of discrimination (by central agencies),” he alleged. Responding to the allegation, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said that allegations are the usual slogan of Congress party leaders to cover their misdeeds. “I’m neither an ED nor IT officer to answer all this. Congress people have become experts on ED and IT, they have experience. Who are they (the Congress) ask why someone was raided? Whatever raids have taken place today (Thursday) will be scrutinised in the court. They conduct raids only based on relevant information,” he said. On April 27, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had filed a supplementary charge sheet against former Karnataka minister Baig in connection with the IMA Ponzi scam case. Baig was the minister for urban development in the Congress-led state government between 2014 and 2018. The CBI named the then MD of IMA Group, Mohammed Mansoor Khan, the company, Baig’s company Daanish Publications, and others in the charge sheet. “It was alleged that the accused former minister received several crores of rupees from IMA funds for election expenditure. It was further alleged that the accused was also utilising the said funds for day-to-day expenditure, including salaries of employees of his firm. It was also alleged that the accused has spent the funds for various social and cultural activities in his constituency to increase his popularity,” read a statement from CBI. While Zameer Ahmed Khan was questioned by ED and other agencies regarding his property transaction with IMA founder Mohammed Mansoor Khan, he has not been charged by any agency till date. IMA was an investment banking company run by Mohammed Mansoor Khan, who claimed it was a Sharia-compliant operation run on Islamic principles, which took huge deposits primarily from members of the Muslim community. When IMA stopped paying dividends in March 2019, investors lodged complaints with the police, and in June 2019, the Karnataka government set up an SIT to investigate the more than 51,500 complaints that had been filed by investors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-raids-properties-of-k-taka-congress-mla-and-former-legislator-in-ima-case-101628193175209.html
06-08-2021||India||Uphill task for Bommai as challenges pile up beyond politics||Bengaluru Karnataka chief minister Basvaraj Bommai has barely a year to go before the state goes into poll mode for 2023 elections, leaving him a very small window to deal with dissent, show progress and circumvent all challenges that have piled up over the last two years during the tenure of former chief minister BS Yediyurappa. In reality, there has been over three years of non-performance as politics trumped development or governance even in the HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S)-Congress coalition government. Bommai, analysts said, has a huge task on his hands if he wants to be seen as a long-term bet for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and not just an interim choice. The chief minister is betting big on the Mekedatu balancing reservoir-cum-drinking water project that shows resilience and commitment not to back down against the threats of Tamil Nadu over Cauvery river water, which strokes emotions on both sides of the border. “Tamil Nadu has always made a political capital of inter-state water dispute,” Bommai said on Thursday. The Tamil Nadu unit of the BJP have begun protests against the proposed Mekedatu project. Bommai said that he will appraise the union leadership on the issue and will follow through to get the detailed project report approved. The chief minister, who has served as water resources minister for five years since 2008, has been keen to get Karnataka’s long-pending irrigation projects back on track. In his very first visit to Delhi after taking office, he pursued the Centre to make all major irrigation projects including Mekedatu, Kalasa Banduri, Yethinahole, Upper Krishna and Upper Bhadra projects to be taken up as national projects. He also takes over as Chief Minister just at a time when Covid-19 is again rearing its ugly head in the state with neighbouring Kerala and Maharashtra witnessing a surge in Covid-19 infections. Yediyurappa had to deal with floods the very month he took over as chief minister but was lucky did not to face the Covid-19 pandemic problem then. However, Yediyurappa presided over affairs during two waves of the pandemic. Bommai has the additional burden of the floods, pandemic, setting right the economy and containing dissent within the party after Wednesday’s cabinet formation. A significant number of core-BJP legislators have been left out of a Cabinet which appears to be composed again only of those wanted by Yediyurappa, Hindustan Times reported on Wednesday. Supporters of Shrimant Patil, who was among the 17 who defected to the BJP in 2019, held protests in Kagwad on Thursday. Several other seniors have been left out of the Cabinet and with just four vacancies remaining out of the total 34 portfolios, it remains to be seen how Bommai and the high command placate dissidents to ensure the saffron outfit comes back to power in 2023 on its own. There is also a challenge to repair the image of brand Bengaluru, which has taken a beating as a Covid-19 hotspot and a city with one of the poorest infrastructure in the country, despite being one of the most industrious. Almost every single road in Bengaluru is in tatters and the rains are making it harder for people to resume normalcy after being locked in their homes for months due to the pandemic. Analysts said that perhaps the biggest challenge for Bommai is to try and step out of Yediyurappa’s shadow and not be seen as a puppet or “rubber stamp”. There is also the sword of corruption hanging on several BJP legislators including Yediyurappa, his son BY Vijayendra and other family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uphill-task-for-bommai-as-challenges-pile-up-beyond-politics-101628193114905.html

Pakistan’s Supreme Court Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed took cognisance of the incident on Thursday after parliamentarian Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, the patron-in-chief of the Pakistan Hindu Council, met him to discuss the temple attack.Pakistan’s Supreme Court is set to take up the temple attack on August 6, and the chief justice directed the chief secretary and police chief of Punjab province to appear for the hearing along with a report on the incident.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular news briefing that Pakistani charge d’affaires Aftab Hasan Khan was “summoned and a firm protest was lodged, expressing our grave concerns at this reprehensible incident and the continued attacks on the freedom of religion of the minority community and their places of religious worship”.The Indian side called on Pakistan to “ensure the safety, security and well-being of its minority communities”.Bagchi said the Indian side had taken note of disturbing reports on social media of the “violent mob attack” on the Ganesha temple in Punjab province.“The mob attacked the temple, desecrated the holy idols and set fire to the premises. In addition to attacking the temple, the mob also attacked surrounding houses belonging to the Hindu community,” he said.Bagchi contended that incidents of “violence, discrimination and persecution against the minority communities, including attacks on places of worship, have continued unabated in Pakistan”.He added, “Within the last year itself, various temples and gurdwaras have been attacked, including the Mata Rani Bhatiyani Mandir in Sindh in January 2020, Gurdwara Sri Janamsthan in January 2020, and a Hindu temple in Karak in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in December 2020.”These incidents, he said, were occurring at an “alarming rate” while Pakistan’s state and security institutions have “stood by idly and completely failed in preventing” attacks on minorities and their places of worship.India and Pakistan often trade charges of attacks on each other’s minorities, reflecting the current downturn in bilateral relations.Following a complaint from a Muslim cleric, police in Bhong village registered a case under the Pakistan Penal Code on July 25 against a Hindu boy for allegedly urinating in the seminary.Reports said local Hindu elders had offered an apology to the seminary’s administration and pointed out that boy was a minor and mentally challenged. After a local court granted bail to the boy, unidentified men incited local residents of Bhong to start a protest on Wednesday.Videos posted on social media platforms showed men with sticks and iron rods smashing the glass doors, windows and lights of the temple and desecration the idols.Some reports suggested an old dispute between Hindu and Muslim groups in Bhong was the real reason for the violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-protests-summons-pak-diplomat-over-temple-attack-101628192755270.html
06-08-2021||India||Parliament nod to bill barring strikes in all Essential Defence Services||The Parliament on Thursday passed a Bill that allows the government to prohibit strikes and lockouts in units providing essential defence services. The Essential Defence Services Bill, 2021, was cleared by Rajya Sabha after Lok Sabha passed it on August 3.It was introduced in the lower house on July 22 to replace an ordinance promulgated in June.The ordinance was issued after the Union Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, cleared the corporatisation of India’s main producer of weapons and military equipment, the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), to boost its efficiency and competitiveness in a long-awaited reform in the country’s defence manufacturing sector.The ordinance made it illegal for the employees of the OFB to go on strike. The factories controlled by the board employ at least 70,000 people who were against the move to corporatise it.Speaking in Rajya Sabha, defence minister Rajnath Singh said, “It is being said that Bill denies the right to peaceful protest. I want to clarify that this bill does not, in any way, deny the right to peaceful protest… We want to improve the autonomy of the ordnance factories and increase their efficiency.”Essential defence services include units or undertakings involved in the production of goods or equipment required for defence. Also, the government can declare any service as an essential defence service if its termination affects the production of defence gear or maintenance of defence equipment.Under the bill, the government may prohibit strikes, lockouts and lay-offs to protect the country’s sovereignty and integrity. Those violating the prohibition order can be punished or fined, or both.The OFB, which controls 41 ordnance factories, will be split into seven government-owned entities that will produce ammunition and explosives, vehicles, weapons and equipment, troop comfort items, opto-electronics gear, parachutes and ancillary products.Ordnance factories are currently engaged in the production of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, mine-protected vehicles, bombs, rockets, artillery guns, anti-aircraft guns, parachutes, small arms, clothing and leather equipment for soldiers.Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said, “There are many precedents in this House and breaking all these precedents, new precedents are being set. The Bill brought by the defence minister is on the additional agenda and this was not supposed to come up today for discussion. But the way there is a ruckus in parliament… They are taking advantage of this situation... and they are getting this Bill passed in some way. This bill is very important. I request you (chair) to send it to a select committee where it will be reviewed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parl-nod-to-bill-barring-strikes-in-all-essential-defence-services-101628189935088.html
06-08-2021||India||2 die while cleaning drain in Telangana||Two workers died of asphyxiation while cleaning a drain in Telangana on Tuesday barely days after the Centre told Parliament that there have been no deaths due to manual scavenging in the country in the last five years.The incident occurred late at night at Padmavathi Colony in Sahebnagar of LB Nagar division, which falls under the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits.Police identified the victims as Shiva (25) and Ananthaiah (45) and said both belonged to the Scheduled Castes. But Ananthaiah’s body had still not been retrieved even 40 hours after he had slipped into a manhole and despite rescue efforts by police, fire brigade and Disaster Response Force teams. Two earthmovers were digging up a narrow pipeline at the time of filing of this report.B Yellaih, who is a contractor employed by GHMC, had hired the two men for the corporation’s desilting work. He allegedly made them enter the manhole around 10:30pm without any protective gear.Later, GHMC issued a release in which it said that the contractor was not working according to the prescribed rules of sanitation, which do not allow any cleaning work to be carried out after 6pm. The corporation added that the contractor also did not notify them about the desilting work.Vanasthalipuram assistant commissioner of police K Purushotham Reddy said Yellaiah has been booked under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, and Section 304A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code based on the complaint by the relatives of the deceased. “The accused is yet to be arrested. Further investigation is underway,” he added.In 2017, the Telangana government had introduced around 70 units of ‘mini sewer-jetting machines’ in a bid to end manual scavenging in Hyderabad. These compact machines could be taken even to narrow lanes without difficulty.“We have four machines in the zone. But we do not know why the contractor asked the men to get into the manhole. We will know the details only after questioning him,” said A Maruthi Diwakar, GHMC deputy commissioner of LB Nagar zone.But the corporation staff didn’t quite buy the argument of the authorities. K Saraswathi, the president of the Safai Karamchari Andolan in Telangana, said the GHMC cannot shrug off responsibility by solely blaming the contractor. “A case should also be filed against commissioner D Lokesh Kumar. The families of the deceased have to be compensated,” she said.Saraswathi elaborated on the compensation argument and said Shiva’s widow is eight months’ pregnant and Ananthaiah is survived by his 40-year-old widow and both women need support.The 2013 law against manual scavenging says: “No person, local authority or any agency shall engage or employ, either directly or indirectly, any person for hazardous cleaning of a sewer or a septic tank.”The Act says the first violation will attract imprisonment of up to a year or a fine of ₹50,000, or both. Subsequent violations will attract imprisonment for up to two years or a fine of up to ₹1 lakh, or both.On Wednesday, the Union government told Parliament that 941 people died while cleaning sewers and septic tanks in the last two decades. It also reiterated the July 28 statement of Union social justice minister Ramdas Athawale in Parliament that there were no deaths due to manual scavenging in the last five years.The government distinguishes manual scavenging — the caste-based practice of people cleaning human excreta by hand — from the cleaning of sewers even though experts say that the latter is just an extension of the now-banned practice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-die-while-cleaning-drain-in-telangana-101628189934680.html

When 1,63,376 samples were tested 20,040 were found positive with a test positivity rate of 13.49%. The state also reported 117 deaths taking the toll to 17,328. The number of active cases also rose to 1,77,924. In the last 24 hours, the country reported 42,982 positive cases with Kerala’s share being more than 50%, health ministry statistics show. Out of 533 deaths, the state reported 117. With fresh cases increasing manifold, the government had announced a new set of pandemic control guidelines but traders said the new norms will invite more trouble rather than solving their woes. There was chaos and confusion at many places and agitated traders asked the government to provide enough vaccines before enforcing such rules. “In the guise of minimising our trouble the government hiked our difficulties,” said M K Chandran, a trader in Chala market in the state capital. According to the new guidelines, only those who have taken at least one dose of the vaccine before two weeks, or who are in possession of RT-PCR negative certificates taken 72 hours before or who are in possession of Covid-19 positive results more than a month old, will be allowed inside shops, banks and other establishments. This is applicable to both workers as well as visitors. Many banks reported thin attendance on Thursday. The Congress-led opposition staged a walkout from the assembly on Thursday saying health minister Veena George’s announcement in the assembly and the chief secretary’s order regarding the new regulations were contradictory. Opposition leader VD Satheesan said in the minister’s announcement in the assembly neither a mandatory vaccine nor RT-PCR test certificate was mentioned. The government’s move to make these certificates mandatory to enter shops will add to the woes of the trading community and it will give more space to law-enforcement agencies to trouble them, he said. But the minister insisted that all would have to follow the new restrictions in the light of the rising cases in the state. However, the opposition leader said only 42.12% of the population had received vaccines and how could the government insist on certificates. He said the police were on a “fine spree” and new regulations would lead to a ‘fine raj’. The minister though rejected the charges of the opposition. “We need strict measures. What the government announced was accepted norms in virus-hit areas. There is no difference between what I read in the house and the one which later came as an order,” she said. Later opposition members stormed out of the assembly saying her explanations were not satisfactory. After many flaws were detected in home isolation, the government has also decided to strengthen grassroot Asha and health workers to enforce quarantine strictly. The central team that visited the state also expressed reservations over the lax home quarantine. The latest genome study conducted by the Institute of Genomic and Integrative Biology (IGIB) Delhi shows the highly contagious Delta variant is playing havoc in the state. Many experts said the volume of cases is worrying not the depth of the infection. They further added that hospitals are not witnessing unusual rush despite the high rate of infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/confusion-reigns-in-kerala-as-govt-preps-to-implement-new-pandemic-norms-101628189877349.html
06-08-2021||India||Opposition likely to protest against the three farm laws at Jantar Mantar||More than 14 Opposition leaders on Friday will discuss a plan to go to Jantar Mantar to protest against the three contentious farm laws and express solidarity with the farmers, who have been camping there since July 22.The Opposition’s move is aimed at widening the ambit of their protests in Parliament, two MPs said. If the plan goes through, it will be the first organised visit of opposition leaders to the farmers’ protest site.Around 200 farmers have been camping at Jantar Mantar since July 22 to hold what they have called a “Kisan parliament’ (farmers’ parliament), a protest against three contentious farm laws timed to coincide with Parliament’s ongoing monsoon session. The farmers are protesting against the laws passed last year that allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of commodities for future sales, and set new rules for contract farming.Also read | Pegasus issue continues to rock monsoon sessionHannan Mollah, one of the key organisers of the ‘Kisan parliament’ at Jantar Mantar, said: “Political leaders are welcome. But they can’t speak from our forum. This is a rule we have adhered to throughout our protests.” “We are putting up a gallery tomorrow morning so that they can sit comfortably and listen to us.”For the Opposition, which has been attempting to block proceedings in Parliament over the Pegasus snooping row, farm laws, and the spiraling fuel prices, a joint visit to Jantar Mantar will add a novelty value to their otherwise repetitive protests and demands during the session. It will also be an opportunity for the Opposition to showcase their unity outside Parliament.On Thursday, 19 Opposition leaders put out a joint statement blaming the stalemate in Parliament to an “arrogant” and “obdurate” government.But it is still a work in progress. At their meeting on Thursday, there was a discussion on improving their coordination in Parliament.“We told all parties that their leaders have to come down to the Well during our protests. It can’t happen that Congress, Trinamool, and Left leaders will be in the Well while lawmakers from NCP or other parties would speak from their seats,” said a senior leader.The opposition parties have demanded a debate on Pegasus with Union home minister Amit Shah’s reply.Government managers have not accepted the demand, arguing that the Union IT minister has already made a statement on the topic in both Houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-likely-to-protest-against-the-three-farmlaws-at-jantar-mantar-101628189875640.html
06-08-2021||India||Pegasus: Government says they 'destroy' the interception records 'regularly'||The communications ministry has said that the government has no records of telephone interceptions since these are “destroyed regularly”, a disclosure that comes at a time when opposition leaders have been seeking answers from the government over allegations that Indians were targeted with a mobile spyware known as Pegasus.Rajya Sabha MP John Brittas, who earlier moved the Supreme Court on the Pegasus snooping issue, filed a question for the Ministry of Communication in which he sought details of “number of persons whose telephones were intercepted from 2016 till today.”Brittas also asked the government whether Indian telegraph act “facilitated the telephone interception of individuals by the government” and in case it was factual, he had sought the “year-wise details” about these interception attempts by the government.Responding to Brittas, minister of state for communications Devusinh Chauhan had said that “such records are not maintained” by the government as they are “destroyed regularly” as required by the law.“As informed by Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the records pertaining to lawful interception are destroyed regularly as per provisions contained in Sub-rule 18 of Rule 419A of the Indian Telegraph (1st Amendment of 2014) Rules, 2014 and Sub-rule 23 of Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring, and Decryption of Information) Rules, 2009. Such records are not being maintained by MHA,” the minister told Brittas.A Gazette notification dated February 4, 2014 suggests an amendment to the Indian Telegraph Act with the subrule 14 under the above-mentioned notification in the Gazette saying: “Records pertaining to such directions for interception and of intercepted messages shall be destroyed by the relevant competent authority and the authorised security and law enforcement Agencies, every six months unless these are, or likely to be, required for the functional requirement.”The minister also added that there were provisions for the government as per Indian Telegraph Act’s Section 5(2) and Information Technology Act’s Section 69 to intercept phones “lawfully.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pegasus-government-says-they-destroy-the-interception-records-regularly-101628189874004.html
06-08-2021||India||Modi slams Oppn for ‘insulting’ Parliament||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday attacked the Opposition for stalling Parliament proceedings and accused them of insulting the House for “their self-interests”.The PM’s remarks come against the backdrop of the opposition parties protesting in both Houses and disrupting listed business since the monsoon session began on July 19.The Opposition , including the Congress, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), has demanded a discussion and a reply from the PM or home minister Amit Shah on the potential use of Pegasus spyware against politicians, journalists, activists and judicial officials.“Some people want to stop the country’s growth by not letting Parliament run smoothly. However, these people don’t know that the country has set about on an irreversible path of development and progress,” the PM said while interacting with the beneficiaries of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), a food security welfare scheme, in Uttar Pradesh via video conferencing.Modi termed the repeated disruptions as “anti-national”.Also read | Pegasus issue continues to rock monsoon session“The great people of this country cannot become hostage to such selfish and anti-national politics. No matter how much these people try to stop the development of the country, this country is not going to stop. They are engaged in stopping the proceedings of Parliament but 130 crore ( 1.3 billion) people are engaged in not allowing them to stop the country,” he said.Stating that those disrupting Parliament were not concerned about the country’s growth, Modi said, “They are not concerned about what the country wants, what it is achieving or how it is changing. These people are hurting both the spirit and the time of the country for their selfish reasons. They are continuously insulting Parliament of India for their self-interests,” he added.This is the second time in as many days that Modi has condemned the Opposition for disrupting Parliament. At a meeting of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) parliamentary party on Tuesday, Modi said the Opposition was insulting “democracy, constitution, Parliament and the people” by disrupting both Houses and asked party lawmakers to display restraint so that the dignity of Parliament is maintained.During the interaction on Thursday, the PM also accused previous governments of exploiting Uttar Pradesh, which goes to polls next year, for political gains but doing little to fuel its development.“People always knew and said that the road to power at Delhi passes through Uttar Pradesh but earlier none thought it fit to think that the state could also fuel the country’s growth. UP’s identity that was previously limited to politics, is changing now as big ticket infra projects, industries and investments have started coming to the state,” he said.Praising the Yogi Adityanath government for changing the state’s image, Modi said: “Under Yogi ji, UP’s image is changing. The common man, the poor aren’t scared anymore and confident that the government is with them.”He added that the state government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic helped save many lives. The state government earlier battled criticism, from experts, Opposition parties and even some BJP leaders, for its handling of the second wave of Covid-19.“Can you even think what would have happened in UP, where even common cold, fever played havoc, had this Covid-19 happened about five years earlier? But today, nearly 5.15 crore (51.5 million) vaccine doses have been administered in the state as a safeguard against the pandemic.”Hitting back, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav said: “It’s beyond comprehension as to what do the prime minister or the home minister praise UP chief minister for. During the Covid time deaths happened in a manner that spaces in cremation ground fell short. There was crisis of beds, oxygen, medicine. There was black marketing of drugs and injections. Unplanned lockdowns threw life and livelihood in crisis. There was large scale migration.”The PM announced that the food security welfare scheme PMGKAY will be extended till Diwali as he applauded the UP government for ensuring the benefits of the programme reached those in need.“The way Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana is being implemented in the state defines the new Uttar Pradesh,” he said, adding that during previous regimes, food grains meant for the poor were looted. In an official statement, the state government said that 150 million people have been provided free ration under the scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-slams-oppn-for-insulting-parliament-101628189817975.html
06-08-2021||India||If reports are correct, Pegasus snooping row very serious: SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to seek a response from the Union government on a clutch of petitions that demanded a court-monitored independent investigation into the alleged surveillance of Indian citizens using Israeli Pegasus spyware and to identify the entities responsible for this.“Let somebody appear for the Union of India to accept notice in the matter,” a bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said. The court fixed August 10 as the next date of hearing and told the petitioners to serve copies of their pleadings on the Union government to ensure that a law officer remains present in the court on the day.“You please serve copies of the petitions on the Union government. The matter has gotten complicated with too many petitions. Some have challenged the vires of the Information Technology law also. Let someone appear on behalf of the Centre and then we will see,” the bench, which also included justice Surya Kant, told the lawyers appearing for the petitioners.During the hour-long proceeding, the bench said the allegations were serious in nature if the reports are correct and posed three questions to the petitioners.Also read | Modi slams Oppn for ‘insulting’ ParliamentThe first was why they came to the court after a gap of almost two years since the first reports on the use of Pegasus spyware were out way back in May 2019. This is a reference to WhatsApp revealing then that NSO’s software had been used to send malware to more than 1,400 phones.The second question was on whether any of the petitioners lodged a first information report or a criminal complaint against alleged illegal interception of their phones.The third related to the existence of any empirical evidence to corroborate the claims of the infractions.The petitioners in the case (through independent petitions) are advocate ML Sharma; Rajya Sabha MP John Brittas; the Editors Guild of India (EGI); journalists N Ram and Sashi Kumar; journalists Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, Rupesh Kumar Singh, Ipshita Shatakshi, SNM Abdi, Prem Shankar Jha; and civil rights activists Jagdeep S Chhokar and Narendra Mishra.The row erupted on July 18 after an international investigative consortium reported that the phones of many Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were among the 50,000 that were potentially targeted by Pegasus, Israeli company NSO Group’s phone hacking software. According to this consortium, Pegasus can switch on a target’s phone camera and microphone, as well as access data on the device, effectively turning a phone into a pocket spy.NSO says its software is sold only to government customers after vetting by Israeli authorities. The Indian government has neither confirmed nor denied that it used Pegasus and has repeatedly ruled out any illegal surveillance in India.“No doubt the allegations are serious in nature if the reports are correct. Except for the petition by the Editors Guild of India, most of the other petitions are based only on media reports. There have to be some verifiable reports etc before we entertain it,” the bench told senior lawyer Kapil Sibal, who was representing Ram and Kumar and led the submissions on behalf of the clutch of petitions.CJI Ramana further asked Sibal: “These reports about the software came to light in May 2019. I don’t know why there is an urgency now. I don’t know why there was no serious concern about this issue. Why has this issue suddenly cropped up after two years? Still, we are not saying anything against it. The petitioners are resourceful persons, reputed journalists. They should have done something more.”As Sibal sought to point out that several details regarding the spyware and the extent of interception were not known earlier, justice Ramana went on to enquire: “Some people claim their phones were intercepted. You know that there are provisions to file criminal complaints for violation of the Telegraph Act. We don’t find anything in these petitions that they approached anybody for filing criminal complaints.”Bombarded with posers reflecting reluctance on the part of the bench to admit the matter, Sibal sought to rely on a finding of a California court. He referred to the Facebook-owned WhatsApp’s suit against NSO in a California court in which the judge held that the surveillance using Pegasus was done at the behest of the government.“There is already a ruling now that this (technology) infiltrates into our lives without our knowing. Then what it does it hears, surveys every minute of our movement. It is an assault on privacy, human dignity, and the values of our republic, as it infiltrates into the backbone of our nation’s internet system,” argued Sibal.At this, the CJI replied: “I have read it in one of the petitions that NSO clarified it sells software only to the vetted governments and then it is for the government to decide how to use it… Also, N Ram’s petition says that the California court has said some of the Indian people’s phones were also tapped. But that doesn’t seem to be correct.”Sibal accepted that there could be some mistake in the petition but emphasised that the EGI has listed 37 specific cases of infiltration.Ram later clarified on Twitter that his petition did not claim anything to the effect.On being asked by the bench if purchase of Pegasus by a ‘government’ will also include a state government, Sibal retorted that his understanding was that only the central government could buy the spyware.“This is also something you haven’t answered. Why after two years? The reports came out in May 2019 but you didn’t come then,” the CJI further asked.Sibal replied: “We have come to know about the extent of surveillance only now. This morning we learned about some officers of this court and a mobile number of a member of the judiciary in the list. How could we file the petition before?”Justice Ramana retorted: “Truth has to come out. We don’t know who all were there.”Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora, appearing for CPI (M) MP John Brittas, informed the bench that a question was raised in the parliament on the use of Pegasus in November 2019 when the then IT minister, Ravi Shankar Prasad, made a statement that there was no unauthorised interception.“Madam Arora. We have a simple question. If you know your phone was hacked, you have the remedy of filing an FIR. Why didn’t you do that? There was no effort to file a criminal complaint,” said the bench.Representing activist Jagdeep Chhokar, senior advocate Shyam Divan submitted that his client’s phone was on the surveillance list. “This wasn’t a case of simple hacking. For a private citizen to find out that a spyware has been turned against him by his own government is like a State waging a war against its own citizens,” contended Divan.But the bench replied: “That is not the issue. We want a clarification whether your client has filed any complaint or not.” Divan replied in the negative.Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for SNM Abdi and Prem Shankar Jha, said that this was not a case of individual surveillance but was a matter of huge dimension where a foreign company is involved.And senior advocate Arvind Datar, representing Rupesh Singh and Ipsa Shatakshi whose names also figure in the database, argued that the investigation was a must because there was no other way for a citizen to know the truth.“Today there are 300 people named. We don’t know how many more will be in the list tomorrow. Who will protect the privacy of citizens of the entire country if not this court?” he added.As advocate ML Sharma, who was the first petitioner in the case, sought to argue his petition, the bench expressed its displeasure at the manner in which he had filed his plea. “Do you have anything except newspaper clippings in your petition? Do you want us to collect materials for you?” it asked Sharma.The bench also noted that Sharma made Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a party to his petition. “You’ve impleaded some individuals as parties to your petition. We can’t start issuing notices just like that to everyone,” it told the lawyer, who said he would be deleting the name of PM Modi as a party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-reports-are-correct-pegasus-snooping-row-very-serious-sc-101628189816222.html
06-08-2021||India||This July was 6th warmest since 1901, says IMD||July 2021 was the sixth warmest July on record in India since 1901 with a mean temperature of 28.52 degrees Celsius — 0.55 degrees above normal — according to the climatological data maintained by India Meteorological Department, Pune.It was the third warmest July when minimum temperatures are considered and eighth warmest in terms of maximum temperatures.The mean temperature is calculated as the average of maximum and minimum temperatures for the month.This July was marked by extremely warm nights almost all over the country except peninsular India which recorded above-normal rains in July. Climatological data between 1901 and now also indicates that four of the five warmest Julys on record have been in the past decade, indicating a rising trend in temperatures in recent years.There was a 7% rain deficiency in July over the country with a 26% deficiency over east and northeast India, 7% deficiency over northwest and central India, but 27% excess rain over peninsular India. The monsoon covered most of the country by June 19 except parts of Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab. After that, the monsoon entered a “break” phase till July 11. OP Sreejith, head, climate monitoring and prediction group, IMD Pune, said high minimum and maximum temperatures in July are linked to deficient rain and a long dry spell.The warmest July recorded was in 2019, logging a mean temperature of 28.65 degrees Celsius, 0.68 degrees above normal; the second warmest July was in 2015 recording a mean of 28.63 degrees Celsius; the third was in 1987 with a mean of 28.61 degrees C; the fourth in 2014; and the fifth in 2020.In terms of minimum temperature, it was the third warmest with a minimum temperature of 24.88 degrees C, 0.56 degrees above normal. The highest was recorded in 2019 at 24.91 degrees C; the second highest in 1903 at 24.89 degrees C; and the fourth and fifth highest minimum temperatures were recorded in 2014 and 2015, respectively.The average maximum temperature this July was 32.16 degrees Celsius, 0.54 degrees above normal and the eighth warmest on record. The highest July average maximum was recorded in 1987 at 32.53 degrees C, 0.91 degrees above normal. The next highest was in 2015 at 32.45 degrees C.“Temperatures were high because clouding was less in the first half of July. Rain picked up in southern parts of the country in July. Many factors may have contributed to a warm July, including the climate crisis. In recent years, temperatures are high and creating records,” said a senior meteorologist from IMD who did not wish to be named.El Nino years are normally linked to very warm summers in India. This year, however, El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-neutral conditions prevailed. Had it been an El Nino year, along with such break monsoon features, it could have been much warmer, scientists said.ENSO is a periodic fluctuation in the sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rain, floods, and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, whilst La Niña has the opposite effect. In India, for example, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Nina is associated with strong monsoon and above-average rains and colder winters.“There were heatwave conditions over many parts of northwest India early in July. The minimum temperature was high from the beginning. Heatwave conditions were reported from Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi NCR. Rainfall was less due to break monsoon, so temperatures soared,” explained Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting company.Average minimum temperatures in July were the second highest on record over northwest India at 24.42 degrees Celsius, 0.87 degrees above normal while over central India they were the highest at 25.18 degrees Celsius, 0.46 degrees above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-july-was-6th-warmest-since-1901-says-imd-101628189696357.html
06-08-2021||India||Kishor resigns as Punjab CM’s adviser ahead of polls||Chandigarh: Months before the state assembly elections, poll strategist Prashant Kishor on Thursday resigned as principal adviser to Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, saying he was taking a “temporary break” from an active role in public life. The political strategist’s decision also came amid talks of his likely induction into the Congress at national level. In a letter to the chief minister, Kishor said he has not been able to take over the responsibilities as his principal adviser in view of his decision to take a temporary break from active role in public life.“Since I am yet to decide on my future course of action, I write to request you to kindly relieve me from this responsibility. I take this opportunity to thank you for considering me for this position,” he said. Kishor, or ‘PK’, as he is often called in political circles, and his agency, Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC), had worked with the Congress in Punjab in the 2017 assembly polls with Singh as the state unit chief. He was also the brain behind the ‘Coffee with Captain’ and ‘Punjab da Captain’ that had worked well for the party.On March 1 this year, the chief minister had appointed Kishor as his principal advisor and given him the rank and status of a cabinet minister. Kishor was paid a token honorarium of ₹1 per month, but was entitled to a fully-furnished government residence and camp office, executive class travel, official vehicle, medical facilities and secretarial staff as admissible to a cabinet minister. During his term as principal advisor to Singh, Kishor held meetings with the party’s first time MLAs and top officials of the state government to gather feedback on the ground realities before he turned busy to work for Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress and M K Stalin-led Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in the West Bengal and Tamil Nadu elections, respectively. Following TMC and DMK’s victory in May, Kishor announced his retirement from election management work and said he would leave the poll strategy business to others in his company. On his appointment in Punjab, he said, “If you help someone win an election, it is nothing if they offer you a principal adviser or adviser’s post. They always like you to be by their side because it suits them. It is for me to decide whether I want to do that or not. I am telling you that I am not doing this work for anybody anymore”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kishor-resigns-as-punjab-cm-s-adviser-ahead-of-polls-101628188915173.html
06-08-2021||India||Nagaland assembly adopts 3-point resolution to resolve border row with Assam||The Nagaland legislative assembly on Thursday held a marathon discussion on the recurrent border issue with neighbouring Assam and adopted a three-point resolution to pursue the settlement of the decades-long dispute.The development comes in the backdrop of recent tensions along the border area between the two states that de-escalated after a chief secretary-level meeting signed an agreement on July 31 to pull their respective forces from the disputed area immediately.The state assembly, after a lengthy deliberation on the matter listed under ‘urgent public importance’, resolved to approach Union home minister Amit Shah to ensure maintenance of status quo agreed between the two states in letter and spirit in the disputed area until the issue is settled. The legislators advocated that the border dispute should be amicably settled outside the court by the two state governments, by involving the local communities from both sides.The House also unanimously decided to constitute a select committee led by chief minister Neiphiu Rio and comprising 10 members including the two MPs from Nagaland – KG Kenye and Tokheho Yepthomi – as invitees, to examine all aspects of the Assam-Nagaland border issue and submit its report within three months.The two states that share over 500-kilometre stretch of inter-state border have been engaged in off-and-on confrontations since 1963. Numerous attempts made by the two state governments in the past to resolve the persistent issue have failed and Assam took the matter to the Supreme Court. The apex court also attempted to resolve the dispute amicably through mediation in 2010, but the report submitted by the mediators was rejected by both states.Then Supreme Court in 2015 ordered both states to file the list of their witnesses along with their testimonies in the form of affidavits with the court’s registrar. But it is reported that the progress is stalled because of the ongoing pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-assembly-adopts-3-point-resolution-to-resolve-border-row-with-assam-101628188437215.html
06-08-2021||India||Protests, celebrations in J&K on 2nd anniversary of revocation of Art 370||An alliance of Kashmiri parties vowed to continue fighting for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s “legitimate rights” on Thursday as sporadic protests marked the second anniversary of the scrapping of the region’s special status and statehood and Bharatiya Janata Party celebrated the day by holding rallies.The People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) -- which is pushing for the restoration of the region’s special status -- held a meeting at the residence of National Conference (NC) chief Farooq Abdullah. Members of the alliance are NC, Peoples Democratic Party, Communist Party of India (Marxist), J&K Awami National Conference, and the J&K People’s Movement.“The alliance reiterated our resolve to continue our struggle for restoration of our legitimate rights,” CPI(M) leader and spokesman of the PAGD, MY Tarigami, told reporters after the meeting.On August 5, 2019, the central government effectively revoked Article 370 which gave special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, and bifurcated the region into two territories- Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.Despite tall claims of the [central] government, the situation since August 5, 2019 is worsening day by day,” Tarigami said. A senior leader of the alliance, who was part of the meeting, said that alliance leadership unanimously agreed that even after a landmark all-party meeting by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on June 24, no confidence building measure was initiated by the Centre.BJP MARKS DAYTerming it a historic day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said that since the revocation of Article 370, there has been “unprecedented peace and progress” in J&K.“It is only on 5th August, when 2 years ago, the country further strengthened the spirit of Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat. On August 5, by removing Article 370, every citizen of Jammu and Kashmir was made full participant of every right, every facility,” the Prime Minister’s Office tweeted.The BJP celebrated the day by holding Tiranga rallies and hoisting the national flag across J&K.J&K BJP chief Ravinder Raina said that the move brought peace in Jammu and Kashmir.“Article 370 was a wall of hatred that had held the people of Jammu in Kashmir in the chains of slavery. Because of article 370 terrorism was born in Jammu and Kashmir and it killed many innocent people...And the central government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has indicated many development projects here,” Raina was quoted as saying to news agency ANI.In Jammu, led by J&K Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) president, Arun Dev Singh, hundreds of BJP workers marched carrying the Tricolour and shouting slogans of “Vande Mataram” and “Bharat Mata Ki Jai”.PROTESTS IN KASHMIRAfter the PAGD meeting, Peoples Democratic Party chief Mufti, accompanied by several party leaders and workers, took to the streets and shouted slogans to condemn the August 5, 2019 decision.Shops and business establishments remained shut in most parts of Srinagar even as a section of traders alleged that police were forcing them to keep their units open. Only shops dealing with essentials such as medicines and vegetables chose to continue with their businesses during the day.While shops in several areas of the city, including the Lal Chowk city centre, were closed, those in other areas such as in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district and parts of Budgam, Ganderbal and Kupwara were open. Vehicular movement also remained partially affected.“I saw policemen calling on shopkeepers and even picking the locks of closed business establishments,” a resident of Lal Chowk said on condition of anonymity.Markets in Residency Road, Hari Singh High Street and Goni-Khan in and around Lal Chowk mostly remained shut for the day.“Despite police coercion, I have not opened my shop. Article 370 was a safety net for Jammu and Kashmir. It’s revocation means we are vulnerable now,” a trader at Srinagar’s Jehangir Chowk said, wishing not to be named.“The situation throughout Kashmir valley remained peaceful and no any untoward incident was reported from any place. Besides, markets and transport also witnessed normal activities as all the types of shops remained open and public/private transport was plying normally across the valley,” said J&K police in a statement, released late on Thursday night.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protests-celebrations-in-j-k-on-2nd-anniversary-of-revocation-of-art-370-101628188435484.html
06-08-2021||India||Goa businessman abducted for ransom rescued, five held||The Goa Police on Thursday arrested five people for kidnapping a plywood businessman and demanding a ransom of ₹1 crore from his wife for his release, Goa Director General of Police Mukesh Kumar Meena, said. Naveen Patel, the 30-year-old businessman, was kidnapped from his shop at Thivim, within the jurisdiction of the Colvale Police Station in North Goa and later taken to an abandoned building where he was blindfolded and held while the kidnappers waited for the ransom. His wife filed a complaint on Thursday morning claiming that her husband had been abducted and she had received a call for ransom.Patel was kidnapped from his shop by one Birendra Kumar, 26, a native of Bihar and Nishant Mogan, 22, a native of Mangalore who posed as customers seeking to buy plywood but later locked Patel in his shop and threatened him with a gun and a knife on August 4. The kidnappers then placed a call to his wife using a stolen phone and sought a ransom of ₹1 crore. “After investigation we found the location of Birendra Kumar and Nishant and the two were picked up and thoroughly interrogated and they revealed that the trader was in an unused building. He was blindfolded, was threatened and they were asking for money. The police teams identified and detained three other accused. There were a total of five men who were involved and they will be prosecuted based on the evidence against them,” Meena said.Manjunath Baiganoor, 28, Sujit Kesarkar and Subhash Bhosle, 51, who were guarding the kidnapped businessman, were also arrested.Mogan was earlier an employee of Patel and used to work in his shop thus knew his former employer’s family members as well. “Were we not to act, his life could have been in danger,” Meena said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-businessman-abducted-for-ransom-rescued-five-held-101628188315182.html
06-08-2021||India||Two killed as men go on shooting spree in Bihar||At least two persons were killed and two others were injured after two unidentified men on a motorcycle went on a shooting spree at Maharajganj in Siwan district of Bihar on Thursday afternoon, police said.Maharajganj is about 140km away from Patna.The incident took place at around 3pm when the miscreants arrived at Ramprit More and started firing indiscriminately before speeding away.“It is not clear who the assailants were and why they fired randomly at the people,” Maharajganj sub-divisional police officer Polastu Kumar said, adding that a search was underway for the accused.“The motive behind the act is yet to be ascertained,” Kumar added.Eyewitnesses claimed that the assailants first shot one Mohammad Arman Mansoori, who died on the spot. They later shot another youth, Sudama Yadav, who was declared dead on arrival at Sadar Hospital in Siwan.The assailants then shot at another man who was identified as Ashok Patel, a resident of Raghunathpur. Another man, Manish Kumar of Ragarganj, was also injured in the incident and taken to Sadar Hospital.“They were shooting whoever they were looking at. Sometimes, they were shooting in the air. The young man riding the pillion had three pistols. Everyone was running for cover. I saw three people fall after being shot,” Mohammad Yusuf, who was with Mansoori at the time of the incident, said.Siwan superintendent of police Kumar Abhinav said a team of forensic experts was present at the spot to collect samples and a probe was underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-killed-as-men-go-on-shooting-spree-in-bihar-101628188194462.html
06-08-2021||India||Pegasus issue continues to rock monsoon session||It was a day of cut and thrust in the Rajya Sabha, with lawmakers from the Opposition bringing up the Pegasus snooping issue and the contentious farm laws, while they were debating a bill introduced in the House. The day was partially washed away on account of protests by the Opposition, and also saw an exchange between defence minister Rajnath Singh and Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge.The Opposition’s strategy -- a response to the government’s unwillingness to have a structured debate on the Pegasus controversy, the farm laws, and high fuel prices -- came on a day Prime Minister Modi said at an event that the Opposition was scoring “self-goals”, criticising them openly for the second time in three days. Earlier in the week, the PM said the opposition parties were insulting Parliament.The Opposition’s behaviour was a clear intent of their resolve on raising the three issues -- and analysts said it does not bode well for legislative business, although the government has been able to pass key laws amidst the din in both houses of Parliament.Their strategy saw frequent arguments with the Chair and trouble escalated when defence minister Rajnath Singh brought The Essential Defence Services Bill for approval of the Upper House. When Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh cited House rule no. 110 to disallow CPI(M)’s Elamaram Kareem from speaking on Pegasus, a furious Opposition started protesting and received unexpected support from TRS lawmaker K Kesava Rao.Also read | Modi slams Oppn for ‘insulting’ ParliamentRao told Harivansh, “You have the right to regulate the time. You can’t give me a scripted speech and tell me to read it. I can speak sense and nonsense in this House. It is my right. Now when Kareem is talking about defence and about the secrecy of defence, Pegasus can also be mentioned.”Kareem also argued that Pegasus is related to defence and security.RJD MP Manoj Jha too, mentioned Pegasus, prompting Harivansh to intervene, but the Trinamool Congress cited freedom of speech of the Constitution.There was also an exchange between Singh and Kharge, with the Congress leader claiming that the former said he would try and resolve the issue after his return from Tajikistan.“If there was a proposal from the government about a meeting whether it is the parliamentary affairs minister or Rajnath Singh, we are ready for the discussion,” Kharge added.Singh denied having given any assurance. He said, “I want to make it very clear; I gave no such assurance to Mr. Kharge. However, I called him and requested that there should be peace in the House, that the House should function normally and that all important issues should be discussed.”The government also hit out at the Trinamool Congress (TMC) for an attempt by some of the suspended MPs to enter the House after it was adjourned on Wednesday.Speaking to media, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi said the TMC MPs should apologise for their conduct in the House because while trying to force their entry into the chambers, they caused injury to a female security guard of Parliament.Joshi also tweeted, “Owing to hooliganism of TMC members, a lady security guard in the Parliament got injured yesterday. This is highly condemnable.” The Chair also made a reference to this incident in the morning.The minister added: “Instead of apologising, (TMC leader) Derek O’Brien is alleging that he was denied entry, post-adjournment. Members of TMC should adopt a better behaviour.”Opposition lawmakers maintained that the Chair was not allowing them to put forth their views while speaking on a bill or during discussion. They alleged that when they referred to any issue which is not directly linked to the bill or topic being discussed, their mikes were being muted.“It was the Opposition’s strategy to raise issues that we have been wanting to speak about in the house. For instance if there is a discussion on the defence bill, it involves national security as does the Pegasus snooping controversy,” said Manoj Jha of the RJD.Two bills were introduced in the Lok Sabha -- one seeking to do away with contentious retrospective tax provisions and another on setting up a central university in Ladakh. Rajya Sabha passed the Essential Defence Services Bill, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pegasus-issue-continues-to-rock-monsoon-session-101628188073958.html
06-08-2021||India||After SC nudge, Centre works on app to settle road accident claims||An online platform accessible throughout India to victims of road accidents, tribunals, police and insurance companies for ensuring speedy disposal of compensation cases will soon be a reality.Nudged by the Supreme Court, the Union government is in the process of developing an online application where victims of road accidents could register their claims while the police could upload accident reports on the platform. The insurance company will respond to the claim petitions and the accident reports on this platform, hastening the entire process.On Tuesday, a bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy took note of a submission by additional solicitor general Jayant Sud, representing the Centre, that all 26 public and private insurance companies in the country have agreed to the idea of having a common online application.The ASG called it a “very positive development”, assuring the bench that the government was committed to making the app functional as soon as possible so as to fasten accountability on all authorities in motor accident cases while cutting delays in disbursing compensation to the victims.The bench expressed satisfaction at the progress made in developing the common app and gave the Union government two months more to ready it.During the hearing, the court lamented that motor accident cases remain pending for several years even though the family may need the financial support immediately. “You give a person ₹10 lakh after 10 or 15 years. What’s the point? He never had it when he needed it the most,” rued the bench.Adjudicating a compensation case, the court had on March 16 issued a slew of directions to facilitate the process of disbursement of damages to the victims of road mishaps as well as for expediting the matters before the motor accident claims tribunal.Aiming at expediting the entire process on disbursement of compensation in motor accident cases and laying down a uniform practice throughout the country, the bench had directed that the police shall send a detailed accident report involving death or injuries to a person in a road crash to the tribunal and the insurer through email within three months of the incident.A claimant, the bench said, could also email the application for compensation with supporting documents to the insurer at the same time, following which the insurer shall email their offer of settlement and the tribunal will finally pass an award.“Each tribunal shall create an email ID peculiar to its jurisdiction for receiving the emails from the police and the insurer as mentioned above. Similarly, all insurers throughout India shall also create an email ID peculiar to the jurisdiction of each claim tribunal,” ordered the court, adding that these email IDs will be displayed prominently by all the authorities concerned for public information.At the same time, the bench had also noted that Tamil Nadu and Delhi were already operating online platforms for submission of accident reports by the police. “Each state having an independent online platform for submission of accident reports, claims and responses to claims, will hamper efficient adjudication of claims, especially where the victim of the accident is not a resident of the state where the accident has occurred. Therefore, the central government shall develop an online platform accessible to the tribunals, police authorities and insurers throughout India,” the court had directed In March.On Tuesday, the bench further asked all states to comply with its previous directives and asked the ASG to submit a report in this regard where further directions are required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-sc-nudge-centre-works-on-app-to-settle-road-accident-claims-101628187835076.html
06-08-2021||India||Halting Taliban attacks focus of UNSC meeting under Indian presidency||The United Nations Security Council meeting on Afghanistan to be held under the Indian presidency on August 6 is expected to focus on stopping the Taliban’s campaign of violence and attacks and ways to take forward the stalled Afghan peace process.India’s ambassador to the UN, TS Tirumurti announced the meeting, which will consist of a briefing and consultations on the latest developments in Afghanistan, in a tweet on Thursday. India holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council for August.The move came two days after Afghan foreign minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar called his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on Tuesday and sought an emergency session of the Security Council to discuss ways to halt the Taliban’s violence and atrocities across Afghanistan.“UN #SecurityCouncil will meet on Friday, 6th August, under Indian Presidency to discuss and take stock of the situation in #Afghanistan,” Tirumurti tweeted.The meeting was convened following consultations with the five permanent and nine other non-permanent members of the Security Council, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The Afghan side is expecting the meeting will focus on the Taliban’s violation of commitments under the 2020 agreement with the US through the group’s ongoing campaign of violence and attacks, and ways to give a nudge to the Afghan peace process that has been stalled for months, the people said.“There is a need for pressure on the Taliban and their sponsors to reduce the violence. It is clear who is backing the violence and supporting the Taliban,” one of the people cited above said.“Also, there is no tangible progress in the peace process because of the Taliban’s intransigence. It is costing Afghanistan in terms of lives, infrastructure, revenues and the gains made in the past 20 years,” the person added.Though there was some talk of a possible resolution on the situation and the Taliban violence, the people said this might not be among the outcomes of the meeting. While Afghanistan’s partners will try to pressure the Taliban and its supporters in Pakistan, the feeling is that China, a permanent member of the Security Council, will step in to counter any move that is critical of Pakistan.Avinash Paliwal, associate professor in the department of politics and international studies at SOAS University, said: “The UN Security Council has its own dynamics, but to have India as president at this point in time is the last thing Islamabad and the Taliban would have wanted. There will be a lot of ‘stock-taking’ in the coming weeks and the Taliban won’t like most of it.”Afghan ambassador Farid Mamundzay welcomed the meeting and thanked India for playing a “lead role as UNSC President”.“Convening an emergency UN Security Council Session on Afghanistan is a positive development. UN & international community must play a greater role to stop the unfolding tragedy in [Afghanistan] due to violence & atrocities by terrorists,” Mamundzay tweeted.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India will share its vision and perspectives on Afghanistan during the meeting. “We look forward to productive deliberations on this issue,” he told a regular news briefing.“We are closely monitoring the evolving security situation in Afghanistan and we continue to call for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire,” he added.Atmar’s phone call to Jaishankar on Tuesday coincided with an attack by a team of Taliban suicide attackers on the residence of defence minister Bismillah Mohammadi in Kabul. The attack triggered an intense hours-long clash between the attackers and security forces that left eight people dead and 20 more injured.There was no Indian readout on the phone conversation, though a statement from the Afghan foreign ministry quoted Jaishankar as saying it was important to hold a meeting of the Security Council to seek the “immediate cessation of human rights abuses and the establishment of lasting peace” in the region.Atmar had on Tuesday briefed the envoys of several countries, including India, on the security situation and the collusion between the Taliban and groups such as Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). The Pakistani envoy was not present at this briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/halting-taliban-attacks-focus-of-unsc-meeting-under-indian-presidency-101628186695412.html
06-08-2021||India||Million homes in parched Bundelkhand to get tap water by year-end, officials say||Ram Chandra, a 70-year-old villager from Mahoba in Bundelkhand -- a rocky, impoverished region dividing Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, is anxiously biding his time to see a dream become reality by the year-end: a water source at his doorstep.“Just last week officials told us we can hope to get water right in our homes by December. We have been waiting all our lives for water,” Chandra said over the phone.Water availability is scarce in at least one half of the country, but perennially drought-hit Bundelkhand’s crisis has been severe enough to force waves of outmigration from the area over the past decade.Several dozens engineering teams in the parched region, spanning 69,000 sqkm, are busy laying pipes, finishing construction of overhead tanks, levelling high grounds and sealing off deep groundwater holes. This is part of a massive project under the flagship Jal Jeevan Mission, a national programme to connect every household in rural India with functioning drinking water taps by 2024.Also Read | At least 100K villages got tap water supply within 2 years: Jal Jeevan MissionThe Bundelkhand leg of the Jal Jeevan Mission comprises 467 piped drinking water schemes under 32 projects. Of these, 43 are surface water-based schemes and 424 are ground water-based.Authorities overseeing the water mission said nearly 1.11 million rural homes covering a population of 7.2 million people will have access to 24/7 treated tap water supply by 2021-end.Nature has been unkind to Bundelkhand region, spread over 13 districts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. It had faced a non-stop seven-year drought between 2003 and 2010.“Nearly 2 million (20 lakh) people are gone. They work as labourers in other states. What to do? How can one live without water?” said Diwan Parihar, a local social activist.These current scope of the water projects will benefit 2,608 gram panchayats (village-level administrative units) in seven districts of Bundelkhand.Nearly 820 million people in 12 major river basins of the country face “high to extreme” water stress. Getting to a water source is a long haul in rural India. According to a National Sample Survey Organisation survey, in Jharkhand, it takes women 40 minutes one way, without taking into account the waiting time. In Bihar, it’s 33 minutes. Rural Maharashtra clocks an average of 24 minutes.The piped water mission, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019, aims to change this drudgery. The programme has entered a critical stage, as officials race to meet the deadline amid the disruptive Covid pandemic.Work on Bundelkhand’s water supply network, officials said, carried on despite the pandemic.“The UP government has completed about 80% work of water treatment plants in various districts of Bundelkhand, including Jhansi and Mahoba. The construction work is almost complete in more than 50% of our plants,” said principal secretary Anurag Srivastava in a text message.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/million-homes-in-parched-bundelkhand-to-get-tap-water-by-year-end-officials-say-101628160952903.html
06-08-2021||India||Assam, Mizoram to withdraw forces; travel advisory dropped||Assam and Mizoram agreed on Thursday to withdraw forces from all disputed border areas and work towards lasting peace in the first meeting between the two states since an unprecedented gunbattle last week killed six policemen and injured 41 others.After the meeting, Assam withdrew a travel advisory issued on July 29 asking its citizens to avoid its neighbouring state. Mizoram condoled the death of the six Assam Police personnel in the July 26 showdown.The meeting came roughly a week after the Centre brokered an interim agreement, under which the states agreed to withdraw their police forces and allow central paramilitary troops to be deployed at the four-km disputed stretch till a permanent solution is found.“Representatives of governments of Assam and Mizoram agree to take all necessary measures to promote, preserve and maintain peace and harmony amongst the people living in Assam and Mizoram, particularly in the border areas,” a joint statement issued by both governments said.The meeting, held at Aizawl Club, was attended by Assam urban developmentminister Ashok Singhal, border protection minister Atul Bora and home secretary GD Tripathi. From Mizoram’s side, home minister Lalchamliana, revenue minister Lalruatkimaand and home secretary Vanlalngaihsaka were present.“Both the state governments agree to maintain peace in the interstate border areas and welcomed deployment on neutral force by the government of India in this regard. For this purpose, both the states shall not send their respective forest and police forces for patrolling, domination, enforcement or for fresh deployment to any of the areas where confrontation and conflict has taken place between the police forces of the two states during recent times,” the joint statement added. This would include all areas along the Assam - Mizoram border.Ministers of both states said there will be more discussions at a higher level to draw a permanent solution to the border dispute issue. Chief ministers of both the states may meet in the near future, and top officials from bordering districts will discuss the issue on a monthly basis, they added.“Considering the present situation on the border, we initiated peace talks between Assam and Mizoram. This is just the beginning, we need to work more on this issue to draw a permanent solution...Assam will withdraw the travel advisory,” said Bora after the meeting.But there was no concrete solution on border demarcation between the two states or ongoing economic blockade of Mizoram by some Assamese groups. Mizoram has alleged that stocks of medical and essential supplies are dwindling due to the blockade of an arterial highway running through Assam.Assam districts of Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi share a 164.6km-long border with Mizoram’s Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit districts. The decades-old border dispute stems primarily from a difference in perception. Mizoram goes by an 1875 border agreement but Assam follows a 1933 demarcation.The police forces of the two states fought a pitched gun battle at a disputed border in southern Assam on July 26, in which six Assam policemen died. Assam claimed Mizoram police opened fire on its forces who objected to a road being constructed by Mizoram on a patch of forested land it claims. Mizoram claimed the land belongs to it.The BJP rules Assam and the Mizo National Front, a part of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance, is in power in Mizoram. The tensions abated last week after central intervention.Tripathi read the joint statement after the meeting that welcomed steps taken the Union home ministry.“The governments of Assam and Mizoram welcome and agree to take forward the initiatives taken by the ministry of home affairs, government of India and hon’ble chief ministers of Assam and Mizoram to remove tensions prevailing around the interstate borders and to find lasting solutions to the disputes through discussions,” said the statement.The ministers avoided questions on the demarcation of the interstate border and the blockade. When the journalists asked Lalchamliana questions on the subject, Bora intervened and said, “We are trying to bring peace, do not ask questions which can hamper this initiative. We have just started a discussion which is going to have several layers.”On the killing of police personnel, he said, “Forget the past, we are heading towards a new phase of border peace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/assam-mizoram-ministers-meet-in-aizawl-today-to-resolve-border-dispute-101628152072265.html
06-08-2021||Today's||Burying the ghost of retrospective taxation||Amid the disruption in the Parliament, the Narendra Modi government introduced a bill, on Thursday, aimed at correcting a momentous blunder in the contemporary history of taxation laws.This blunder pertains to the Manmohan Singh government’s notorious retrospective amendment in the Income Tax Act in 2012. After losing a tax dispute to Vodafone on the issue of taxation on indirect transfer of Indian assets, the government nullified the judgement by altering Section 9(1)(i) of the Income Tax Act retroactively. Taxing indirect transfer of Indian assets implies taxing the gains arising out of the transfer of shares by a non-resident in a company incorporated abroad, if the share derived its value, directly or indirectly, substantially from assets located in India.This regressive legislative development, later extended to Cairn Energy’s internal restructuring, triggered a spate of legal disputes. Vodafone and Cairn Energy sued India before investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS) tribunals constituted under the India-Netherlands and the India-United Kingdom bilateral investment treaty (BIT).Also Read | Centre moves bill in House to stop retrospective taxThe Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) valiantly resisted the retroactive amendment while in Opposition. Thus, many assumed that the Modi government would correct this gaffe on coming to power. But the new government pursued these claims robustly. Both the ISDS tribunals indicted India for violating the fair and equitable treatment (FET) obligation under the two BITs. India didn’t comply with the awards, which compelled Cairn Energy to start enforcement proceedings aiming at attach Indian assets in several countries.Finally, it seems, good sense has prevailed. The tax bill states that the amendment to Section 9(1)(i) will not apply to indirect transfers of Indian assets made on or before May 28, 2012. In simpler terms, the law on taxing the gains arising out of indirect transfer of Indian assets shall be prospective.Exorcising the retrospective aspect of Section 9(1)(i) implies that the tax department can no longer pursue taxation claims against Vodafone and Cairn Energy for its pre-2012 transactions that involved indirect transfers of Indian assets. The taxes collected would be returned without interest. This bill removes the legal measure that formed the basis of ISDS claims against India by Vodafone and Cairn Energy, thus, hopefully bringing the curtain down on the arduous international legal battles.However, this law is subject to certain riders. Both Vodafone and Cairn Energy will have to withdraw their legal claims against India including under international law. Also, the investors will have to waive their right to pursue legal claims for retrospective taxes. This implies that Section 9(1)(i) and the attendant tax provisions would continue to apply retrospectively if investors do not meet these conditions.While it is quite evident that the adverse ISDS awards triggered this amendment, it seems India is still not accepting the decision of the two tribunals. The fact that India will return only the principal amount, not the interest is a clear pointer to this. For instance, the ISDS tribunal ordered India to pay $1.2 billion (the tax collected) plus interest and other costs, totalling about $1.7 billion to Cairn Energy. As per the bill, India will only return $1.2 billion (the principal amount) to Cairn Energy. Thus, Cairn Energy will still lose about $0.5 billion. It remains to be seen whether Cairn Energy and Vodafone will accept this as an honourable settlement. It is also not clear whether India would stop pursuing challenging the Vodafone and Cairn awards in Singapore and The Hague, the respective seats of arbitration.While this amendment will shore up the confidence of foreign investors, and give a leg-up to the overall economic sentiment, one needs to ask a larger question. What did India gain out of this misadventure that lasted for more than nine years? It will not get the much-needed revenue that it kept hoping for. On top of it, taxpayer money and other scarce resources were spent in fighting expensive cases in international tribunals. Plus, India’s reputation in the eyes of the world as a prime destination for foreign investment was tarred, upsetting India’s growth story.The key takeaways from this nine-year-long sordid episode are as follows.First, before introducing such drastic legal and policy changes, those in power should weigh and balance the benefits and costs prudently in a transparent fashion. Legal certainty is an aspect that foreign investors value enormously. A penny-wise pound-foolish kind of approach often proves detrimental.Second, there must be a better internalisation of India’s BIT obligations by the government.Third, while the right to tax is indeed a sovereign right, a fact attested by numerous ISDS tribunals, this right has its limits. Abusing the right to tax vis-à-vis foreign investors will spark claims under international law. Changes in the legal regime through taxation should be reasonable and proportional to the public welfare sought to be achieved.Fourth, amending tax laws retroactively is a bad idea. The Shome committee — a special committee appointed by Manmohan Singh to examine the implications of the 2012 amendment — categorically said that retrospective application of tax law should occur in exceptional cases such as to counter highly abusive tax planning, rather than expand the tax base. One hopes that our policymakers and legislators have learned their lessons now.Prabhash Ranjan will soon join Jindal Global Law School, OP Jindal Global University, as professor and vice dean The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/burying-the-ghost-of-retrospective-taxation-101628255339663.html
06-08-2021||Editorials||Reward champions, men and women||Minutes after the Indian men’s hockey team won an Olympic medal after 41 years, the Centre as well various state governments announced major monetary rewards for the players, and rightly so. In the Indian sporting system, a medal at the Olympics results in a windfall for the athlete, or in this case, a team. Most players in the bronze medal winning team had to struggle as young players to get access to the basic requirements of the game — gear, equipment, an artificial turf. And they deserve recognition and encouragement, both symbolic and material.This rationale should also be extended to the Indian women’s hockey team, who did not win a medal and lost in the bronze medal playoff to Great Britain. But the players lifted a nation’s spirit with their grit, talent, and determination. There is good reason to treat the women as winners too.Also Read | Women athletes and their journeys of gritThe women’s team only began getting attention and support — in terms of funding, coaching systems, facilities, tech support — in the last four years. Experts had predicted that the women won’t make it out of the group stages. The team was beaten in the first three matches. But then, there was a nearly miraculous turnaround. India beat 2018 World Cup runners-up Ireland, South Africa, and three-time Olympic champions Australia to qualify for the semi-finals. Then they fought till the end against the defending Olympic champions, Great Britain, losing 3-4.For a team that didn’t even qualify for the Olympics for 36 years until Rio 2016, this fourth place finish is nothing less than a victory. It should be celebrated just like we still revel in perhaps the most famous fourth place finish in India’s sporting history — the late Milkha Singh in the Rome 1960 400m final. The fact that many women players in the team come from a history of socio-economic marginalisation — captain Rani Rampal’s father was a cart-puller — and yet beat all odds to emerge as champions, even if they didn’t win a medal, deserves recognition. Young girls picking up hockey sticks should know that they can make a career out of the sport. The Haryana government has made a start by announcing a cash reward of ₹50 lakh for each of the nine players from the state who competed in Tokyo. But others should follow suit and celebrate India’s hockey champions, men and women, who have given a new lease of life to a sport that’s integral to India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/reward-champions-men-and-women-101628254498588.html
