13-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi school board gets nod from apex certification council to affiliate schools, conduct exams, grant certificates||New Delhi: The Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE) has secured an approval from the apex body for school board certification, paving the way for the newly-formed state board to affiliate schools, conduct examinations and grant certificates that are equivalent to other recognised boards in India, the Delhi government said on Friday.According to government officials, the approval was issued on August 6 and received by the education department on Friday.According to a press release from deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s office, a letter issued by Council Of Boards of School Education (COBSE) in India stated, “...On the grant of COBSE membership to Delhi Board of School Education, secondary and higher secondary examinations conducted and certificates issued by it would have equivalence to the corresponding certificates of other member-boards of COBSE...”COBSE, an autonomous body, primarily verifies the genuineness of school education boards in India and facilitates its recognition.The governing council of the Association of Indian Universities (AIU), an inter-university organisation which acts as a representative of universities in India, also approved the new state board proposal and resolved to “give equivalence to Delhi Board of School Education with CBSE and other recognised boards of India”, the government said.“With this, DBSE is all set to affiliate schools, conduct examinations and grant certificates which shall be treated as equivalent to the corresponding certificates issued by other recognised boards in India. This will enable the students from DBSE affiliated schools to take admission in other boards and its certificate will be valid for admission in higher educational institutions,” the statement added.The development comes shortly after the DBSE signed an agreement of collaboration with the International Baccalaureate, which has agreed to be a knowledge partner and provide curriculum framework for the content to be taught at DBSE schools.“Collaboration with International Baccalaureate opens world-class opportunities for our children. With COBSE and AIU approvals, the DBSE is all set to transform learning assessment,” said Sisodia.In March, the Delhi government had announced that it would have its own state board, and move away from the pattern of one-time year-end exams and opt for continuous assessment to do away with rote learning.In the first phase, 30 government schools will be affiliated to DBSE out of which 10 are Sarvodaya schools for classes nursery to 8, and the remaining are Schools of Specialised Excellence for classes 9 to 12, focusing on domain-specific education of students. Admissions to the 20 SoSEs began on Thursday and so far the education department has received over 7,500 applications.“In next few years, all the government schools of Delhi will be affiliated to the DBSE which has started functioning in partnership with International Baccalaureate (IB). Besides, the recognised private schools in the city too will have the option of affiliating themselves with the DBSE,” said the statement issued on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-school-board-gets-nod-from-apex-certification-council-to-affiliate-schools-conduct-exams-grant-certificates-101628879155177.html
13-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: FYJC registrations to begin today, 1st merit list on Aug 27||Confusion and ambiguity surrounding the online registrations and admissions to first year junior college (FYJC-Class 11) seats ended on Friday with the release of the final admissions schedule. After the Bombay high court (HC) recently clarified that FYJC admissions will be conducted based on students’ Class 10 marks and not any entrance test, the office of the latest schedule released by the Secondary and Higher Secondary office states that online registrations will begin from August 14, Saturday.While the provisional general merit list will be released on August 23, the first general merit list will be released on August 27 at 10am. “In the year 2021-22, Common Entrance Test (CET) was introduced for Class 11 admission. This CET, however, has been cancelled as per a government resolution dated August 11. AS per directions of the Bombay HC also instructions have been given by the education department to start the process of FYJC admission in the state,” said a circular released by the department of secondary and higher secondary education on Friday.This year, Class 10 board exams across several school education boards had to be scrapped due to rising Covid-19 cases. Results for the Class 10 batch was instead based on students’ performance in Class 9 and 10 combined. This decision helped boost marks of students across school education boards. While the overall success rate of Secondary School Certificate (SSC) students was 99.5% this year, ICSE student in Maharashtra and CBSE students from the Pune region (which includes Mumbai) boasted of a 100% success rate.Considering no exam was held for class 10, the state government decided to conduct a CET exam, based only on the state board syllabus, in order to bring students from all boards on the same platform for FYJC admissions. While the exam was left optional, state minister for school education had clarified that priority in the first common merit list will be given to those students who appear for the CET. Nearly 11 lakh students had already registered for the exam which was scheduled to be conducted in physical mode on August 21. A petition filed by an ICSE student questioned the logic behind conducting an entrance exam based on the state board syllabus for all FYJC aspirants, and the need for a physical exam. The HC then directed for the CET to be scrapped and admissions to be conducted based on Class 10 marks only. “It was unfair for the state government to force all students to appear for an exam based on a syllabus alien to non-state board students. While the initial hurdle is over, we are now worried about high cut-offs once admission begin,” said Sharanya K, an ICSE student from Andheri.This year, the almost 100% success rate for SSC, ICSE as well as CBSE Class 10 students also meant a large number of students scoring 90% and above. More and more ICSE and CBSE schools witnessed 50% or more of their batches scoring 90% and above in their results this time round. Similarly, figures made public by the Maharashtra state board revealed that SSC 1,04,633 students received more than 90% marks and 957 (including 32 in Mumbai division alone) students got 100% this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtrafyjc-registrations-to-begin-today-1st-merit-list-on-aug-27-101628878795730.html
13-08-2021||Chandigarh||Stop acting like leader of oppn party: AAP to Sidhu||Chandigarh The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday asked newly appointed Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu to stop acting like a leader of an opposition party, telling him to try and ensure that promises made by his party in the 2017 assembly elections are fulfilled in the remaining six months. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Punjab affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha said that Sidhu is the undisputed leader of the ruling party in Punjab with patronage from the Congress high command and unequivocal support of all party MLAs in the state. “Sidhu cannot act like an opposition leader. It is now incumbent upon him to deliver what he and his party had promised to people in 2017,” Chadha said at a press conference here. The AAP leader’s full-blown attack on Sidhu came at a time when the latter has been hitting out at the state government, including chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, for more than two months over unfulfilled poll promises. Chadha also released a letter that he sent to Sidhu along with a copy of the Congress’ 2017 election manifesto, imploring him to get over with the playtime and finally deliver on the 129-page poll promises. “Otherwise, it will become crystal clear that your infighting and struggle within the Congress was a fight for power and not the progress of Punjab,” he said. Chadha said it had come to his notice that the Congress had craftily removed the manifesto from their official website. “Not to worry, I am appending a copy so that Sidhu can get it handily and be willing to implement the promises,” he said, cautioning the Congress leader not to mislead the people by telling them that promises would be fulfilled in the party’s next government. The AAP leader also reminded Sidhu that he was the star campaigner of the Congress in 2017 and became a cabinet minister after the formation of the Congress government which did not fulfil even a single election promise. “His (Sidhu’s) government still has six months. If he does not fulfil the election promises, people of Punjab will understand it that his fight with Amarinder was just a battle for the chair,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/stop-acting-like-leader-of-oppn-party-aap-to-sidhu-101628878679463.html
13-08-2021||Chandigarh||‘Corrupt cops’ facilitated terrorists’ entry into Pathankot airbase: Book||New Delhi“Corrupt local police officers” were suspected to have scouted the Pathankot airbase before the terror attack at the IAF facility in 2016 and one of them identified a no-surveillance spot which was used by the raiders to heave ammunition, grenades, mortars, and AK-47s, a new book has claimed.This claim has been made by journalists Adrian Levy and Cathy Scott-Clark in their book “Spy Stories: Inside the Secret World of the RAW and the ISI.” On January 2, 2016, a team of gunmen wearing Indian army fatigues waded through a branch of the Ravi river on the India-Pakistan border. Arriving on the Indian side, the men hijacked vehicles and drove towards the sprawling Pathankot air force base.Scaling a perimeter wall, they recovered in the long grass and then ran towards a residential compound where the first gunfight crackled. Four attackers were killed as also three members of the Indian security forces.Four more Indian soldiers died the following day in an IED blast. It took three days for the security forces to be certain they were back in control. India responded by heaping pressure on battle-weary Pakistan, threatening war, the authors say.“But internal reporting by combined intelligence was coruscating and painfully honest. It acknowledged that several key pieces of protection were missing ‘despite constant warnings’. More than 91km of the Punjab border was not fenced,” they write. “At least four reports had suggested that rivers (and dry creaks) were vulnerable spots, but no nets were pegged across them. There were no extra patrols, despite six written requests. Surveillance technology and movement trackers had not been deployed,” they say.They also quote a BSF officer telling them that the border guarding force was “thin on the ground because it concentrated its activities in Kashmir, and its requests for more men had been ignored repeatedly”.On the Pathankot strike, Levy and Scott-Clark say that terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed had paid for the 350 kilos of explosives but they had been procured in India and the haul was waiting for the raiding party on the Indian side. “Indian allies, including corrupt local police officers, were suspected of scouting the airbase. “One of these cops had found an area where there were multiple vulnerabilities: the floodlights were down, and the CCTV cameras had no coverage. There was no surveillance equipment of any kind and a large tree grew beside the perimeter wall that one written report identified as a security hazard,” the book, published by Juggernaut, says. An Intelligence Bureau (IB) officer who investigated the case told the authors that the “police officer or one of his collaborators had climbed up and attached a rope. The raiders had used it ‘to heave over 50 kilos of ammunition, and 30 kilos of grenades, mortars, and AK-47s’ used in the strike”. The heavily armed JeM militants sneaked into the airbase, killing six soldiers and an officer. Four militants were gunned down by the Indian security forces.The authors write that after the 2019 Pulwama attack, “spy games were at play by seasoned officers on both sides of the border who knew that once the past was edited the future remained clouded”. The book also mentions how ISI considered Kulbhushan Jadhav, a former Indian Navy officer on death row in Pakistan over espionage charges, a “small fry” and “intended to turn him into an enormous trophy”. They quote an unnamed officer connected with the ISI who says, “The ISI waited patiently, hoping to grow Jadhav into something special and then when he was big enough, as a target, the ISI would pull him in.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/corrupt-cops-facilitated-terrorists-entry-into-pathankot-airbase-book-101628878497286.html

13-08-2021||Chandigarh||Congress’ urban MLAs seek cut in power tariff at meeting with Sidhu||ChandigarhPunjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday held a meeting with party ministers and MLAs from urban areas during which several of them pressed for reduction in power rates and restoration of electricity connections disconnected due to non-payment of bills before next year’s assembly polls. The three-hour meeting held by the newly appointed state unit chief at Punjab Congress Bhawan here for first-hand feedback from party leaders also saw the party legislators take up the regularisation of buildings and plots in illegal colonies, need to avoid confrontation and ensure round-the-clock power supply and easing the process of NOC for registration of property in urban areas among others. Cabinet ministers Sunder Sham Arora and Bharat Bhushan Ashu and MLAs Pargat Singh, Amit Vij, Rajinder Beri, Surinder Dawar and former MLA Ashwani Sekhri were among more than a dozen-odd party leaders who attended the meeting, besides working presidents Kuljit Singh Nagra and Pawan Goyal. Cabinet minister Balbir Singh Sidhu was also present, but he left early as the PPCC chief could not arrive on time and the meeting started late, said sources. Several senior ministers and MLAs, who also represent urban areas, did not come for the meeting. A party leader said they probably had prior engagements or did not get intimation in time. The appointment of a non-Congressman, who has been criticising chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, as an adviser was discussed by some members who stressed the need to work for unity in the party and avoid confrontation, said a party leader who did not want to be identified. Of the four persons named by Sidhu as his advisers, activist Malwinder Singh Mali’s attacks on the CM have riled a section of the party. Another suggestion by a Congress leader was the need to constitute a state-level committee to mediate and settle the differences between party leaders, including MLAs, mayors and councillors, for smooth functioning. A Congress statement said the meeting concluded with consensus that party and government must act towards a priority agenda to give relief to people of urban areas. The foremost demands were 300 units of free power to all domestic consumers, including general category, power at ₹3 per unit for domestic consumer and ₹5 per unit for commercial and industrial consumers, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-urban-mlas-seek-cut-in-power-tariff-at-meeting-with-sidhu-101628878376432.html

On Thursday, a team led by Vaibhav Nagar, assistant manager of the Greater Noida authority, conducted inspections in the 14 housing complexes in different sectors and found that the waste is not being treated as per the rules.“The bulk waste generators should collect, segregate and treat the waste on their premises. But these societies are violating waste management rules. We have imposed penalties and action will continue against other such violators,” said Nagar.The authority has fined four societies in Knowledge Park 3, three in Sector Zeta 1, two each in sectors Mu 1, Pi 1 and Pi 2, and one in Omega 2, the officials said.“We have imposed penalties in the range of ₹11,000 to ₹81,000 depending upon the nature of violation by the societies. All stakeholders need to follow rules,” said Nagar.According to the rules, if a society produces more than 100kg waste daily or is built on 5,000 square metres or above area, then it needs to segregate and treat its waste at source. Such a society will be considered bulk waste producer, say the rules.The authority wants to encourage bulk waste generators to make compost out of green waste. “We want to reduce the quantity of waste that goes to landfill.

13-08-2021||Noida||Diversions for I-Day parade, vehicle checking cause traffic snarls at Noida borders||Traffic diversions put in place for the Independence Day parade and vehicle checking at borders points brought vehicles to a grinding halt on Friday, much to the inconvenience of daily commuters. The Noida traffic police issued an advisory for heavy vehicles, prohibiting them from entering Delhi, which was in effect from 10pm on Thursday to 12 noon on Friday. Any such vehicles coming to the Delhi border via Chilla, Delhi-Noida-direct flyway or Kalindi Kunj were advised to take a u-turn towards the Noida-Greater Noida expressway and then go to Delhi via the Eastern Peripheral Expressway. However, the diversions led the traffic to crawl across all border points in the morning. “The normal 40-minute journey took more than 70-80 minutes. The congestion started in the morning itself. Heavy vehicles were parked on the side of the roads blocking several lanes. Near Rajnigandha crossing itself, we could see some cars turning around but it was actually the vehicles parked on the lanes that were aggravating the traffic scenario. The police barricades further compounded traffic. The traffic situation was the same till most of the afternoon,” said Brajesh Sharma, a Noida resident, who travels to Khel Gaon, Delhi for work daily. Officials from the traffic department said despite the advisory, many heavy vehicles tried to take the prohibited routes, which was the root of all the problems. “Some of them were being turned around gradually. The traffic started slowing down around 7am and was the same across DND and Kalindi Kunj till around noon. Vehicles from Noida to Delhi were also being checked, which further aggravated the problem. Delhi police was also conducting checks. We kept sharing updates with the public on social media through our helpline,” said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Ganesh Saha. Officials also said the slow traffic movement on the Noida-Greater Noida expressway was due to an increase in the local traffic because of the diversions and the re-surfacing work going on there. The same diversions will be in place for the Independence day parade from 10pm on Saturday to 1pm on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/diversions-for-i-day-parade-vehicle-checking-cause-traffic-snarls-at-noida-borders-101628878076014.html
13-08-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad plans mega vaccination drive||The district health department has planned to take up another mega Covid-19 vaccination drive on Monday, for which they have placed a request for about 70,000 doses, said officials aware of the development. According to the CoWIN portal, till 7.30pm on Thursday, the district has so far administered 1,677,366 vaccine doses and stood third in the state after Lucknow (2,246,535 doses) and Gautam Budh Nagar (1,776,904 doses). During the last vaccination drive held on August 3, the district topped the list of shots administered in a day in the state, with 79,822 beneficiaries receiving the jab--the highest single-day tally in the district so far. “After the drive on August 3, we have planned to administer about 60,000 doses and have asked for about 70,000 doses from state officials for the purpose. Such mega vaccination drives will help us increase our coverage and benefit beneficiaries, who find it difficult to book slots. We will open more jab centres on Monday to meet our vaccination target,” said Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar, chief medical officer. According to officials, the district--after the mega vaccination drive on August 3--has administered about 86,293 doses till August 12 at an average of about 10,786 doses per day. “The daily doses administered is around 10,000 per day and this is because there are few vaccine stocks. This forces us to keep a limited number of vaccination centres open and hence, beneficiaries face delays in getting the jab,” said an officer from the health department who wished not to be named. According to the figures of the district health department, till August 11, the district achieved 41.75% first dose coverage for beneficiaries in the 18-45 age group. Likewise, the first dose coverage for 45+ age group category is 55.35% for first dose and 25.55% for the second dose. To increase the second dose coverage, the UP government recently declared Saturday as a ‘second dose day’, when only second vaccines dose will be administered to beneficiaries. Experts said that extensive drives should be carried out every week so that more beneficiaries can get vaccinated. “Due to short supply of vaccine, there are days when very few beneficiaries get the jab. Mega drives increase community outreach. People will go to the vaccination centres if such facilities are opened in colonies and local residential areas. Hence, such drives are ideal to cater to a large population and get more beneficiaries vaccinated ,” said Dr V B Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-plans-mega-vaccination-drive-101628878014510.html
13-08-2021||Noida||Greater Noida authority kicks off ‘smart village’ project||After being delayed by four months on account of the second wave of Covid-19, the Greater Noida authority on Thursday kick-started its ‘smart village’ project. In the first phase, the civic infrastructure in 14 villages will be revamped, starting from Maincha village where a foundation stone laying ceremony was organised on Thursday.According to officials, a total of ₹150 crore will be spent on 14 villages that include Maincha, Chapraula, Sadullapur, Tilpata-Karanwas, Gharbra, Cheerasi, Ladpura, Aminabad (Niyana), Sirsa, Ghanghola, Astauli, Jalpura, Chipiyana Khurd-Tigdi and Yusufpur Chak Shahberi. The officials said the project was supposed to take off in April this year but the work had been stalled due to the pandemic. The first phase will be completed in one year, they said.“We have been working on this project for over a year now. Wapcos Limited, a central government’s consultancy firm, visited each village under the project and prepared a detailed project report that will now be implemented in two phases. The company had given a presentation in February this year,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.Initially, ₹150 crore has been allocated for 14 villages and more funds will be released as per requirements for the second phase, the officials said, adding that free Wi-Fi services will be provided in these villages. “We aim to develop these villages with proper amenities and infrastructure that are available in urban areas. The first phase of the project involves improvement in civic infrastructure like sewer system, drainage, roads, water supply, and streetlights, among others,” said Bhooshan. The second stage of the project entails improvement of public infrastructure like schools, hospitals/health centres and community centres, besides beautification of ponds and creation of children’s parks, the officials said.According to the survey of the consultancy firm, various issues have been found in Maincha that need revamping. “For example, while the village has sewer lines, they are not connected to the sewage treatment plant. Similarly, it has water supply pipes but they are not connected to the source (water tanks). Such errors will be rectified under the project,” said Bhooshan. Going forward, almost 120 villages of Greater Noida will be converted into ‘smart’ ones in the next three to four years, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-authority-kicks-off-smart-village-project-101628878015205.html
13-08-2021||Noida||Vaccines’ paucity results in higher turnout at private centres in Gautam Budh Nagar||The scarcity of Covid-19 vaccines at government health care facilities in Gautam Budh Nagar has resulted in higher turnout at inoculation booths in private hospitals of the district. The private vaccination centres, which had less than 25% share in vaccination between July 29 and August 4, increased their share to nearly 54% between August 5 and August 12, according to the data of the district health department. Also, the number of government vaccination centres in GB Nagar has been reduced to 16, which was over 40 till August 4. According to the data , a total of 121,032 people were vaccinated in the district between July 29 and August 4, of which 91,684 beneficiaries (75.75%) took their jabs at the government vaccination centres. But after that, the speed of vaccination at government centres slowed down, mainly due to acute crisis of vaccines in the state. Of 77,213 jabs administered between August 5 and 12, only 35,229 (45.71%) were given in the government facilities while the rest (about 54%) at private centres, shows the data. Attributing the lower turnout at government centres to the crisis of vaccines, GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that with the present amount of supply, it will be impossible to run the vaccination drive at full swing. “This is a statewide crisis. At the same time, one shouldn’t forget that GB Nagar has been ranked first in vaccination drive by the state government as nearly 1.7 million people, out of estimated eligible population of about two million, have been vaccinated. We are committed to provide at least one dose of vaccine to the entire eligible population of GB Nagar by the end of November this year,” he said. Echoing similar views, Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer, said that the district health department is left with around 10,000 doses of vaccines. “With this stock, we can run the drive for two more days, and that too not full-fledged. However, we’ve sent our requisition for vaccines to the state government and hope to get adequate supply very soon,” he said. When asked about the rising number of vaccinations in the private facilities, Tyagi said that it is obvious in the present scenario. “People have suffered a lot during the two waves of Covid-19. And, when there is a possibility of the third wave, they will not wait for free vaccines for a long time. To me, choosing some other options for vaccination is not a bad phenomenon. We can increase the vaccination figures only after getting the ample stock of vaccines,” he said. Private hospitals said that the turnout at private facilities has increased as people now don’t want to wait for getting vaccinated.“Witnessing the loss of lives during the pandemic, even the people from lower income groups have realised that it is better to be safe than sorry. They are not ready to risk their lives for ₹700-800. Not only that, the facilities and the logistics available at the private centres are better than the government centres,” said Ajit Kumar, director (public relations) of Sharda hospital. It may be noted that during the single-day mega vaccination drive on August 3, there were 200 government vaccination centres in the district. On August 4, it came down to 42 and after that it has been reduced to only 16. Since August 7, the shots are being given at these centres to only those who booked their slots online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/vaccines-paucity-results-in-higher-turnout-at-private-centres-in-gautam-budh-nagar-101628877954568.html
13-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: BNHS starts SGNP biodiversity survey along twin-tunnel route||Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) has commenced a biodiversity monitoring survey at Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) along the route of a proposed subterranean tunnel, which will connect Borivli to Thane and reduce travel time between Mumbai’s eastern and western suburbs from one hour to around 15 minutes. The twin tunnels will traverse the boundary of the SGNP protected area for 4.7kms, connecting Film City in Goregaon to Amar Nagar in Mulund.BNHS’s first quarterly report, as part of its three-year-long exercise, is due within a couple of months, officials privy to the development said. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is footing ₹4 crore for this, which officials likened to a similar monitoring and mitigation study for avian biodiversity being carried out in Thane Creek by BNHS as a result of the trans-harbour link project.BNHS had been engaged as a consultant for the SGNP twin-tunnel project at the behest of the National Board for Wildlife at the time of granting wildlife clearance for the project in 2019. The ongoing biodiversity study, according to a forest department official, will first make a thorough inventory of all flora and fauna found within the study area prior to the beginning of construction in March 2022.“The tunnel line itself is around 50 metres wide and the study area extends to 500 metres on each side of the tunnel line. From plants to insects, spiders, reptiles, and larger mammals like leopards and deer, all will be accounted for. The study has been underway for two months and the study area has been divided into different grids. BNHS has formed a dedicated team which spends 10 days of every month in the field, surveying these grids,” said the official.Once inventory is completed, researchers will attempt to identify those species which may face a higher risk as a result of the tunnelling work. A preliminary ecological sensitivity report submitted to the forest department by Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) suggests that leopard, sambar deer, Indian python, Indian cobra and Russell’s vipers “are the major wildlife found in some of the study areas around the proposed alignment”.The preliminary report had also identified a few species of “conservation importance”, including three species of plants — saraca ashoka (Sita ashok), garcinia indica (Kokam), White Orchids; three mammals — leopard, rusty spotted cat and sambar deer; two birds — brown fish owl, mottled wood owl; as well as the Atlas moth and blue mormon butterfly which are the largest known butterfly and moth species.In all, the forest patches and protected areas around SGNP provide a habitat for over 1,000 plant species; around 251 species of migratory, land and water birds; 50,000 species of insects; 43 species of mammals; 38 species of reptiles; nine species of amphibians; 150 species of butterflies; and a large variety of fish.“The main impact is expected from vibrations caused due to tunnelling during construction phase. BNHS’s contract with BMC states that they will continue to monitor the area for a period of two years from the date of construction. So, if there is any cause for worry, it will be reported to us and appropriate steps for conservation will be taken,” said the forest department official.A technical pre-feasibility report for the proposed tunnel by MSRDC in November 2017 had noted that “project activities such as drilling would temporarily produce activity and manual entrance that would disturb wildlife and cause them to disperse. This local displacement would create a short-term impact to large and small mammals. Displacement would affect a small number of overwintering breeding birds. Overall, effects on wildlife would be short-term and minor.”The proposed tunnel has recently become a topic of discussion again among city’s green campaigners who questioned the lack of a dedicated environment impact assessment (EIA) for the project, and its exemption from environmental clearance (EC) despite being located within the boundary of a protected area.Stalin D, director of NGO Vanashakti, said the tunnel could potentially destroy the underlying aquifers feeding Tulsi and Vihar lakes, which provide Mumbai with a modicum of water. He also stressed that the cumulative impact of all projects encroaching upon the national park — such as the dedicated freight corridor which includes 10.8 hectares of forestland diversion in SGNP — be considered as opposed to assessments of individual infra works.Veteran environmentalist Sunjoy Monga, however, said that the benefits of the project, in terms of reducing traffic congestion and air pollution in the city, outweigh any ecological risk. “The sheer density of cars per square kilometre of road in Mumbai is among the highest in the world. Tunnelling technologies are fairly sophisticated at this stage and have been used for similar projects by more developed nations. Exemption from EIA is another matter, but speaking specifically of this project, it is an important one that will have environmental benefits,” he said. G Mallikarjuna, chief conservator of forests, SGNP, could not be reached despite several attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-bnhs-starts-sgnp-biodiversity-survey-along-twin-tunnel-route-101628877896698.html

I am very happy with my progress as a player. I played G league first and now playing in Summer League, and I am working towards the NBA. I didn’t think I will reach this far. It sometimes feels like a dream,” Singh said during a virtual press conference.“My next goal is playing at the NBA, Satnam Singh was the first Indian to play and I want to play for long time in NBA, so my focus is on taking care of my body and keeping myself fit.” Satnam had played in the Summer League in 2016 after being first drafted in the NBA by Dallas Mavericks in 2015.The 20-year-old Singh, whose first professional stint was with the NBA Academy’s Ignite team in the G-League, made a brief appearance of just a minute and 22 seconds during the match, which they won 89-75.“It is a great experience to play against the top players in Summer League. They are all NBA players, who have been drafted. Lot of learning and my game is improving,” said Singh, the first-ever NBA Academy India graduate to feature in a Summer League game.“My coach (Bobby Jackson) asked me to play hard, said I should focus on my game and I will get more time. He asked me to focus on strong rebounding and defence and look to score.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sometimes-it-feels-like-a-dream-princepal-singh-on-his-nba-journey-101628877895246.html
13-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt refuses to share Rashmi Shukla’s report, related material with CBI||The Maharashtra government has refused to share with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) any documents or other material about phone tapping done by IPS officer Rashmi Shukla when she was the commissioner of state intelligence department and her report about corruption in transfer and postings of senior police officers.The government on Friday filed an affidavit through advocate Ajay Misar stating that the report and related documents were seized as evidence in the case registered by cyber police in connection with the purported illegal phone tapping and leaking of Shukla’s report, and presently all those documents are submitted to the forensic science laboratory (FSL) at Kalina for analysis.The affidavit is filed in reply to a plea filed by CBI, seeking direction to the state to part with the report and documents for the central agency’s probe in the corruption case registered on April 21 against former home minister Anil Deshmukh.CBI has registered the offence after former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh on March 20 wrote a letter alleging that Deshmukh had, as home minister, on number of occasions summoned some Mumbai Police officers at his official bungalow and told them to accumulate ₹100 crore from bars and other establishments in Mumbai.The agency has included the topic of Shukla’s report and reinstatement of controversial dismissed cop Sachin Vaze in the purview of its probe in the case against Deshmukh and had sought the documents for the investigation.Shukla had carried out telephone tapping between July 17, 2020 and July 29, 2020, after a number of complaints were received at various levels in the police department and in Mantralaya that some persons were acting as conduits for senior police officers to secure transfers at desired places and good postings by paying the then home minister and one “dada”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-refuses-to-share-rashmi-shukla-s-report-related-material-with-cbi-101628877775343.html
13-08-2021||Mumbai||Smooth-coated otters spotted in Kharghar creek in Navi Mumbai||Birdwatchers spotted a pair of endangered smooth-coated otters in Navi Mumbai’s Kharghar creek while on a birding trip on Friday afternoon. The species, whose presence around Konkan coast has been previously documented, are listed as “vulnerable” as per the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) red list of threatened species globally. They are also protected under Schedule 2 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.The otters were spotted and photographed by birders S Ramprasad and Sanjeev Balsara near Sector-16 in Kharghar, which is a popular birding area. “We were excited and took some pictures before the creatures disappeared. They were very fast-moving,” said Ramprasad, whose pictures were later corroborated by researchers at Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS).The presence of these otters, one of six species found in Asia, has been documented in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts earlier. In 2017, the first-ever census of smooth-coated otters along Maharashtra coast pegged their population at around 500. The census had found between 437 and 591 otters across 12 creeks in Sindhudurg. With small eyes and ears, a flat tail and webbed paws, smooth-coated otters hunt in groups for safety, found the census conducted by the state mangrove cell and Pune-based NGO Ela Foundation. The study had also identified threats to the otter’s habitat such as sand dredging, water pollution from pesticides, and industries leading to high turbidity in some creeks where they hunt for fish.In 2019, a pair of otters was seen in Roha, Raigad district. “Friday’s sighting is possibly the first time in several years that these otters have been seen so far north. It indicates that the area may have a healthy fish population. Further vigilance and study are required to know whether these otters were in Kharghar creek in search of food or if they are living there,” said Rahul Khot, assistant director, Natural History Collection Department, BNHS.Navi Mumbai-based environmentalist BN Kumar, who runs NatConnect Foundation and has been campaigning for the creation of a biodiversity protection plan, said, “This sighting is all the more reason for authorities to take stock of and find measures to protect such wildlife. We have created a list of 20 areas across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) including Kharghar creek, that require a higher level of protection. We will present our findings to BNHS for their consideration this week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/smoothcoated-otters-spotted-in-kharghar-creek-in-navi-mumbai-101628877596475.html
13-08-2021||Mumbai||Teachers oppose Mumbai University’s plan to set up 73 new colleges||Teachers of the University of Mumbai (MU) have raised their voice against the varsity’s plan to add 73 new colleges to its roster. Members of the academic council, representing the Bombay University and College Teachers Union (BUCTU), registered their dissent against the university’s proposal to add new colleges according to the perspective plan in the academic council meeting held on Thursday. Even as the perspective plan was passed with majority votes in the academic council, teachers’ representatives at the council were unhappy with the move. Perspective plan is a detailed five-year plan prepared by the varsity to chart the future course of action. “The 73 proposed colleges in the plan are put forward without fundamental study, without considering the precarious conditions, geographical locations. The statistical data received from the university clearly shows the drastically falling enrolment of students from 2019 onwards. At present the colleges in Konkan have not been able to complete even 50% of the usual enrolment. Existing colleges will be adversely affected and the entire landscape will be wiped out,” read the dissent note. Council members and BUCTU members Madhavi Nikam, Tanuja Sarode, Sudhir Nikam and Dhakne Rajendra, who made the dissent note, declined to comment. MU pro vice-chancellor Ravindra Kulkarni was not available for a comment.However, an office-bearer of BUCTU said, “The stand taken by the four council members is representative of the teachers’ stand. New colleges have been proposed without due diligence and not taking into account why some colleges are seeing poor enrolment.”Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, enrolment numbers for the university dipped in 2020-21 to 1.9 lakh from 2.2 lakh the year before, according to data released in a senate meeting earlier this year. However, BUCTU has been opposing new colleges since 2018. In a letter to the chancellor that year, BUCTU members had said the varsity completely missed three inputs while preparing the perspective plan — district maps with location of colleges, population figures and year-wise enrolment data. It had also pointed out procedural irregularity in the process. In 2019, BUCTU again wrote to the chancellor complaining that the varsity had not placed the perspective plan for 2020-21 before the senate, academic and management councils.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/teachers-oppose-mumbai-university-s-plan-to-set-up-73-new-colleges-101628877595296.html

13-08-2021||Patna||Ganga hits record level at Mokama, high alert along banks||Bihar’s water resources department (WRD) has heightened surveillance along the course of Ganga in the state after the river set a new highest flood level (HFL) of 43.21 metres, nearly two metres above the danger level (DL), at Hathidah of Mokama and maintained the rising trend at Patna and elsewhere on Friday, department officials said.The gushing currents of a swollen Ganga have flooded riverine areas of Patna, Chapra and Vaishali districts, and those in Bhagalpur, Buxar and Bhojpur in the past 24 hours, as the river’s water level rose by 9-27 cm compared to Thursday.The Central Water Commission (CWC) has issued an “extreme” flood alert for the Ganga stretch from Barh in Patna to Barahiya in Begusarai, where the river kept on rising after jumping the HFL. Officials said more than 22 lakh population in various districts of north and central Bihar have been impacted due to the current spell of floods from Ganga and its tributaries like Bagmati, Burhi Gandak, Kamla, Khiroi, Gandak, Sone, Kosi and Punpun, which continued to flow about the DL at different locations.WRD secretary Sanjeev Hans, however, ruled out any immediate threat of flooding in Patna, saying that the river was still flowing below the HFL of 2016. Likewise, situation with Sone and Punpun is also under control, he said. “WRD officials have been asked to stay prepared to meet any eventuality in Buxar, Bhojpur, Patna, Chapra, Vaishali, Katihar and Bhagalpur districts, though,” Hans said.Chief minister Nitish Kumar, meanwhile, visited flooded areas of Patna, Saran and Bhojpur along with officials of WRD and its minister Sanjay Kumar Jha. Senior officials of disaster management and road construction departments also accompanied him. He also inspected a few flood relief camps and enquired about the facilities provided to the persons sheltered there. The officials manning the camps have also been told to ensure strict adherence to the Covid safety protocols.In Patna, timely intervention of WRD engineers averted a possible flooding in western part of the city from Patna canal, which originates from Sone in Aurangabad and terminates in Ganga near Digha.

Tirkey, who joined Congress after a split in JVM (P) after 2019 assembly polls, was speaking to media persons during a press conference at his residence in Ranchi. He argued that the state government should come up with its own format for holding caste and religious census. “The state has now got the powers after the Lok Sabha passed the 127th constitutional amendment to identify OBC groups. But, what will it amount to if we don’t know the exact numbers of caste sub-groups? There are several sub-castes even in tribals and Muslims. We need to ascertain their numbers,” said Tirkey. Batting for religious census, Tirkey said that there have been demands of a separate religion census as well like Sarna. “By including religion in the new format, we will also be able to know how many among tribals are followers of Sarna, Christianity or any other faith,” he said.Granting a separate Sarna tribal religious code in Census 2021 census has been a long pending demand in the state. A unanimous resolution to this effect was passed by the Jharkhand assembly last year, demanding the Centre to include Sarna Tribal religious code in the religion column in Census 2021, arguing that majority of tribals, who have not converted to Christianity, are otherwise forced to select ‘Others’ column in the census.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/prepare-own-format-for-caste-religion-census-in-j-khand-mla-to-hemant-govt-101628873034929.html

In July, the PCB issued a public notice asking the vendors to main “status quo” at the market and refrain from carrying out any further constructions. On March 26, as many as 600 shops were completely gutted after a major fire broke on Fashion Street.CEO Amit Kumar in his written communication to the police, stated: “Kind attention is invited to this office letter under reference wherein this office has time and again requested your good self to deploy adequate police force on urgent basis in order to maintain status quo till the final decision of the board and to avoid any untoward situation and disruption of law and order.” He further said that despite steps taken by the board to prevent hawkers from undertaking any construction, it has been reported that a further raising of illegal structures is in progress.A copy of the letter has also been marked to the Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta, PCB president and the MG road hawkers’ association.Recently, the board received complaints about structures being built without mandatory permission. The board wants to construct a commercial complex equipped with all the fire safety norms. Fashion Street, adjacent to MG road, houses small outlets selling garments, shoes, and other accessories. There are 448 registered shops and 200 unauthorised outlets located in the market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pcb-asks-lashkar-police-to-act-on-violation-of-status-quo-at-fashion-street-101628872614203.html

13-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: IIT-B, Kasturba researchers develop quick test to predict high-risk severe Covid patients||Researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) and Kasturba Hospital, Mumbai, who were part of a global industry-academia collaboration, have developed an algorithmic model that can predict if a patient is more at risk of becoming severely ill from Covid-19. The team, which included doctors and scientists from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Australia and Agilent Technologies in the United States, have designed a novel method of using infra-red technology to rapidly test which patients are most at risk of becoming severely unwell from Covid-19. Their work was published in the peer-reviewed journal Analytical Chemistry on July 19.The team was led by Sanjeeva Srivastava, professor in the department of biosciences and bioengineering and head of the Proteomics facility at IIT-B, who has been studying protein patterns in Covid-affected patients since last year. His team has been working with Kasturba Hospital for conducting a comprehensive proteomics-based investigation of nasal swab and plasma samples from Covid-19 patients to identify host prognosis markers by employing simple extraction strategies. Earlier the team had used high-resolution mass spectrometry to establish a panel of host proteins. Building on this work, Srivastava endeavoured to create a simple test to detect any spike in proteins in the patient. “While mass spectrometry gave us accurate results, the process was cumbersome and required heavy equipment. So we needed to build a more handy test,” said Srivastava. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to measure the levels of different chemical groups in a sample. “From our FTIR study as well as previously performed mass spectrometry-based proteomics study, we can say that there is a correlation between blood chemical signature and becoming severely unwell with Covid-19. However, we can’t conclude that slight differences in these chemical groups cause patients to become more unwell. We can only conclude that there is an association,” Srivastava said. From their previous works, the team had a large database of protein spikes in patients’ plasma samples. “We recorded the spectra of around 130 patients with mild and severe symptoms using FTIR spectroscopy. There were mild changes in the spectra of samples collected from patients with severe symptoms,” said Srivastava. These changes in spectra were sent for analysis to QIMR Berghofer. The head of QIMR Berghofer’s Precision and Systems Biomedicine Research Group and associate professor, Michelle Hill, said “We found there were measurable differences in the infra-red spectra in the patients who became severely unwell. In particular, there were differences in two infra-red regions that correspond to sugar and phosphate chemical groups, as well as primary amines, which occur in specific types of proteins,” Hill said. The head of QIMR Berghofer’s Statistics Unit, Dr Gunter Hartel, then used artificial intelligence to develop an algorithm to work out which chemical groups, or ‘signatures’, were correlated with patients who became severely unwell. The test – which performed with 85 per cent accuracy in a small pilot study of Covid-19 patients – could in future be used to triage patients in areas with large outbreaks of Covid-19. “It’s easy to use and much more convenient than RT-PCR. It’s simpler than the tests that doctors are currently doing to study protein spikes such as keratin,” said Srivastava. Dr Jayanthi Shastri, head of the microbiology department from Kasturba Hospital, said this kind of blood-based test will be beneficial for the clinicians in determining the severity of Covid-19 patients in India. The study was primarily funded by India’s Science and Engineering Research Board, the Government of India, and a grant from IIT.Arghya Banerjee, lead author of the study and a doctoral candidate in IIT-B said, “We now need to test the method in additional patient groups to confirm whether the findings of this study can be applied to other populations. We also found that having diabetes was a predictor of becoming severely unwell in this group of patients, so we fed this information into the algorithm. We then tested the algorithm on blood samples from a separate group of 30 patients from Mumbai and found it was 85 per cent accurate in predicting which patients would become severely ill. However, it did result in more ‘false positives’ than predictions that were based solely on the clinical risk factors of age, sex, hypertension and diabetes. We hope that with more testing we can reduce these false positives”. Scientists feel if the infra-red test proved successful in further trials, the teams hoped it could be used in hospitals facing high volumes of Covid-19 patients.“While many countries worldwide are quickly vaccinating their populations, we know that it will take longer to vaccinate other nations, particularly in the developing world,” Hill said. “This simple infra-red test only takes a few minutes. We hope it could be a quick and cost-effective way of triaging patients who present at hospitals, particularly where capacity is limited. Patients with a high likelihood of severe Covid-19 complications could be admitted early in their illness, while other patients could potentially be sent home to monitor their symptoms,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-iit-b-kasturba-researchers-develop-quick-test-to-predict-high-risk-severe-covid-patients-101628872195866.html

Several alumni and existing students had met SPPU vice- chancellor Prof Nitin Karmalkar sharing their opposition to the merger.On Saturday, Uday Samant, state technical and higher education minister will visit Ranade Institute. The SPPU circular announcing the merger, released last week, stated that department would be renamed as the Department of Communication, Journalism and Media Studies, under the faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies. This circular was not published on the official SPPU website, so when students came to know about it, they immediately formed a “Ranade Bachao Kruti Samiti”, to oppose this decision.On Friday, SPPU issued a fresh circular, which read, “The decision on the merger of the department was based on the NAC committee guidelines to have a school system in the university and for the students benefit. Also we had consulted senior faculties and experts from the field to take this decision, but as there was opposition to it the merger has been cancelled”.Kuldeep Ambekar an alumni student and president of Students Helping Hand organisation said, “The notification issued has several points missing. There is no signature of any authority like the vice-chancellor or registrar. It is issued in a hurry just to show the minister who is coming that some action has been taken.

The new order from the government came as the existing curfew is scheduled to end on August 15.Outdoor government programmes following proper maintenance of physical distancing and health and hygiene protocols have been allowed in the state, according to the new rules. “Opening of Theatre Halls, Sadans, Manchas, Auditoriums and open air theatres for cultural activities, with not more than 50% of seating capacity,” has also been allowed, the order showed. Further, the government has also allowed stadiums and swimming pools to remain open with half their capacities at a time.All shops and establishments including restaurants and bars which were previously allowed to remain open till 8pm, can now remain operational until 10.30pm, the order further said. However, the government also said that outdoor activities barring emergencies would not be allowed between 11pm and 5am.“All outdoor activities including movement of people and vehicles shall be strictly prohibited between 11pm to 5am except for health services, law and order, essential commodities including agricultural produce and other emergency services,” the order showed.Local train services in the state continue to remain suspended as no relaxations were offered. Earlier on Thursday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said that the train services have not been resumed due to the fear of the third wave of infections. “The Covid situation in Bengal is quite good but the danger of the third wave is still lurking. This is one of the reasons we have not allowed local trains,” news agency PTI quoted Banerjee as saying. “If we get vaccines, we can at least ensure one dose of vaccine for the rural population and then we can allow local trains,” she added. “We have decided a few relaxations -- such as full lockdown during the night will now be from 11 pm to 5 am, instead of 9 pm to 5 am,” she further said.On Friday, 739 more people tested positive for the disease in WB, taking the total confirmed cases in the state to 1,537,185, a bulletin from the state government showed.

After Bombay High Court cancelled the Common Entrance Test (CET) which was going to be conducted on August 21 for Class 11 admissions, the education department has geared up preparation for the admission process. The first general provisional merit list for admissions to first year junior college (FYJC) through the online mode will be declared at 10 am on August 23, state director of education (secondary and higher secondary) D G Jagtap said on Friday. The education department finalised the admission schedule after the state SSC results were declared online on July 16 this year. “The entire admission process will be online this year and on August 23 we will declare the first general merit list of round 1 for eligible candidates. Students can take objection or a correction request can be made till August 24. Then on August 27 junior college allocation list will be displayed for round 1. Starting from August 27, students can proceed to the respective colleges where they have got admission as per the process. On August 30, the junior colleges will upload the status of admitted students on their website and further admission rounds will be continued,” said Jagtap. The process of filling forms online has started from August 9. When the SSC state board results were declared on July 16, part 2 form of the admission process was opened up. This year due to the Covid-19 pandemic there was a delay in the SSC results. Now the admission will be done on the basis of Class 10 marks. “For students who have confirmed their admission in any of the junior colleges through the centralised admission round or through any quota admission process, the process will be considered completed. Junior colleges will be permitted to surrender the vacant minority and in-house quota seats after round 3.

13-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Only 1.5mn MMR citizens will be able to take trains after it opens from Aug 15||Though the state government has allowed fully vaccinated people to travel by local trains, the percentage of the working population in the fully vaccinated people is around 40% of 3.48 million citizens in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) who have taken both their doses. This means merely 1.4 to 1.5 million citizens could be benefited from the relaxation at least for the next few weeks.The train travel which was restricted only for the people from emergency and few essential sectors from April 15 after the second wave of Covid-19 struck Mumbai, will be opened for the commuters fully vaccinated from August 15. In MMR, to which the three lines of suburban train services cater, the fully vaccinated population is 3,482,426 as of August 12. Of them, 2.56 million are in the age group of 45-plus years, while merely 314,000 are in the age group of 18-45 years.As per the estimates of the state’s relief and rehabilitation department, among the fully vaccinated people over 45-plus, more than 60% are senior citizens who generally do not travel by train for office work. Around 20% of the working class people prefer to travel by road, according to officials from the state government. The remaining 6,11,945 are healthcare and frontline workers who anyway were allowed to travel in the trains. This means, including the fully vaccinated people in the age group of 18-45 years, around 1.4 million citizens can take benefit from the relaxations being rolled out from Sunday.The percentage of fully vaccinated people in 18-45yrs it too low as only 314,000 have been fully vaccinated though the first dose administration in the age group has been done for whopping 18.84 million citizens. This is mainly because of the tweaking in the central government policy over the gap between two doses of the vaccine. Immediately after the vaccination was opened for the 18-45 years group on May 1, the mandatory interval between two doses was increased to 12 to 16 weeks. This has forced many from the working class to wait longer and they will be due for their second doses this month.“It is true that a limited percentage of the fully vaccinated people will be able to travel in train at least for few more days. That is the reason there is no much of rush at the centres opened for the registration at the railway stations. But the main idea behind unlocking is the gradual relaxation to avoid any crowding at public places. Until the working people in 18-45 are due for their second dose and they complete 14 days after it, we will have the manageable crowd in the trains at least for one more month. If only a million people are added to the current footfall of 1.9 million, it will be much less than 8 million travellers in pre-Covid times,” said an official from the chief minister’s office.Railway authorities have also stated that the number of passes issued to passengers in the first two days has been less than anticipated. “The number of passes issued have been nearly constant on both days. We were anticipating an increase which did not happen. However, there could be a rise after the verification process has been made online.” said a senior railway official.Aseem Kumar Gupta, principal secretary, relief and rehabilitation department said, “We are expecting 1.5 to 2 million people to register for the universal travel pass in the first phase. The number may go up gradually once the second dose backlog is done with, in the near future and a few more relaxations are given. We are expecting the people who do not regularly travel by train, too, to register for the pass for convenience. The online portal is working very smoothly and we have brought down the turnaround time for the e-pass to four hours. Until 6pm on Friday, we have received 43,000 requests for the universal e-pass in 24 hours.”Passenger associations have stated that they would ask the Maharashtra government to consider reducing the gap between vaccines that would enable more commuters to travel.“Of the 8 million people that travelled by the local train services before coronavirus 30% people are currently working from home. We want more commuters to be able to travel by trains and will approach the state government asking them to consider reducing the gap between vaccines. The task force members will be able to advise and reduce the gap days that will allow more fully vaccinated passengers to commute.” said Lata Argade, secretary, Suburban Railway Passenger Association.Of the fully vaccinated 3.48 million citizens in MMR, 2.02 million are from Mumbai, 1.03 from Thane and 207,130 and 227,102 from Palghar and Raigad respectively. MMR has nine municipal corporations and nine municipal councils.In all, the state has administered 48,206,726 doses, of which 12,466,250 are towards second doses. Of the total doses administered, 18.8 million are in18-45 years age group, 16.5 million in 45-60 years, while above 60 years have been administered with 12.85 million doses.On Thursday, 32,534 monthly passes were issued to the suburban railway passengers on both the Central and Western Railway networks.

About 10,000 children and teenagers, including about 2,000 engaged in hazardous work, have been identified in the past five years. Action has been taken in the form of prosecution being launched against over 1,000 employers, but there appears no check on children being engaged as labourers in Uttar Pradesh. “From August 16 to 30, the state government proposes to launch another campaign to identify child labourers and act against establishments employing them,” said Suresh Chandra, additional chief secretary, labour. There are apprehensions that many of those, who may be identified in the drive, may begin working as child labour again in the next few weeks. “Efforts are made to send such children to school or action is taken for their rehabilitation. Yet, many of such children return to the same or other work establishment within a few weeks,” said a functionary of the state’s labour department. Besides launching special campaigns from time to time, the labour department has also implemented Naya Savera Yojana in collaboration with the Unicef in select villages of 20 districts of UP to make these areas child labour free. Apart from Lucknow, the districts covered under Naya Savera Yojana are Kanpur, Agra, Bareilly, Badaun, Moradabad, Ghaziabad, Barabanki, Gonda, Bahraich, Shravasti, Balrampur, Mirzapur, Sonebhadra, Jaunpur, Ghazipur, Varanasi, Ballia, Prayagraj and Gorakhpur. “Under this scheme, 39,856 children in 6 to 14 years age group have been identified and 26,933 of them have been rehabilitated in the past four years. In the 15 to 18 year age group too, 16,383 have been identified and 5,290 have been rehabilitated. About 6,679 families have been registered with Uttar Pradesh Bhawan evam Sannirman Karmkar Kalyan Board (welfare agency for construction and other workers),” said another functionary. As a number of children and teenagers are also seen begging and selling small items at various crossings in the state capital and in other major towns, there are apprehensions about possibility of certain criminal gangs leading them into such activities. “A large number of children and teenagers are working as child labourers though the exact number is not available. In many cases, the children identified and rescued return to work as child labour in the absence of any major scheme for rehabilitation,” said Sangeet Sharma, former member, Child Welfare Committee.“There may be some cases of child trafficking but hardly any criminal case is registered. Anti Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) and Special Juvenile Police Units (SJPUs) have been set up in every district, but authorities are not able to take action as parents of such children often deny involvement of any gang. Under such circumstances, efforts made to identify those working behind such children may prove futile,” added Sharma. ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar said effective action would be taken in any criminal case. “We will work in coordination with government agencies to ensure effective action,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-govt-to-crack-down-on-establishments-employing-children-101628871595046.html

The HC, while permitting the release of Ahmed on furnishing personal a bond of ₹1 lakh and sureties, has imposed stringent conditions and asked him to stay within the jurisdiction of the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Mumbai.Ahmed has also been directed to report to NIA Mumbai branch on a regular basis till the conclusion of trial and will have to surrender his passport and has been restrained from tampering with the evidence and asked to cooperate with the investigators and attend court as and when required.The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, after hearing the bail application of Ahmed at length, had been informed by senior advocate Mihir Desai that as he had been arrested and was in jail since 2016 and the trial was not expected to begin any time soon Ahmed deserved to be released on bail. The bench had reserved its order on July 14 and pronounced the same on Friday, August 13.In August 2016, the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) had arrested two persons namely Nasir Chaus and Shaheed Khan for hatching a conspiracy to target the Aurangabad ATS unit. The duo had disclosed the name of Ahmed who was subsequently arrested in the same month. Ahmed and the others were booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for allegedly joining the ISIS.According to the prosecution, Ahmed was part of the Parbhani module of ISIS and was a co-conspirator in the plan to attack Aurangabad ATS and target a senior police officer who had killed an alleged SIMI operative in 2012. The case was later transferred to the NIA.During arguments Desai had pointed to the fact that the charge sheet did not show Ahmed’s involvement in making explosive devices and stated that the NIA could not establish that his client had propagated the IS ideology. He referred to statements of witnesses which said that they had heard the accused discussing ISIS only in context of world politics.Desai sought bail for Ahmed on the lines of the Areeb Majeed case and said that his client would cooperate with the probe and attend the trial once it commenced.Special public prosecutor Aruna Pai for NIA had, however, opposed the application and stated that there was sufficient incriminating material against Ahmed to show that he was working against national interests. She had also submitted that due to the pandemic the special NIA court was finding it difficult to hear cases on a day-to-day basis. Pai had added that while the prosecution had been doing its duty in a time bound manner, the delay was being caused as Ahmed and the co-accused had been filing multiple petitions before the court.After hearing the submissions and while reserving its order, the court had observed that many accused were languishing in jail as trials failed to commence for a long time and the pandemic had further contributed towards paralysing the system. The order containing details and grounds for grant of bail will be uploaded in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-alleged-isis-recruit-of-parbhani-module-gets-bail-101628871175066.html

As many as 1,307 degrees of different batches are left with the university. The university charges ₹2,000 for each degree. But now, these degrees will be sent to the students and affiliated colleges without any fee. “We have started sending degrees by post to students whom we are able to contact over telephone and confirm their address,” said Dr Singh, who is looking after the process to send the degrees. Starting from 2005 and 2006 (27 degrees), the maximum pending degrees (642) are of the 2020 batch students, including MBBS and nursing.

13-08-2021||Lucknow||'Medal of Excellence' for UP cop who got infant's rapist convicted in 34 days||Police inspector Neeta Rani, who probed the sensational rape case of a one-and-half-year-old girl in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras and the accused convicted in just 34 days, has been awarded the Union Home Minister's 'Medal for Excellence in Investigation' in 2021, officials said on Friday.Rani, posted as the in-charge of the Chandpa police station in Hathras in western UP, is one of the 10 police officials from the state and only 152 from across the country who have been named for Centre's honour this year, they said.She also happens to be the first woman to be appointed as in-charge of any police station in Hathras, according to local officials.Rani was appointed the Station House Officer (SHO) of Chandpa in Janaury this year, after the infamous episode of a 19-year-old Dalit girl's gang-rape in the region and eventual death due to injuries in September 2020.The episode had led to severe criticism of law and order situation in UP and rolling of heads, including then SP of Hathras, Vikrant Vir."A rape case was reported to the Chandpa police station on January 2 this year. The victim was a one-and-half-year-old girl. The accused belonged to the same village as the girl," a Hathras police spokesperson said.Considering the sensitivity of the case, an FIR was immediately lodged under IPC section 376 (rape) and under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, the spokesperson said."Inspector Rani took up the investigation and the scientific evidence in the case was collected carefully with the help of forensic department. The charge sheet was filed with the local court in just 11 days," the official said.In light of the effective arguments and solid evidence against the accused, the court ordered imprisonment for life for the convict and also slapped a ₹1-lakh fine on him, the official said, adding all legal proceedings were concluded in just 34 days.Hathras SP Vineet Jaiswal said the Union Home Ministry's honour to the inspector will definitely work as a morale booster for the entire force."I had appointed her the SHO of Chandpa in January only. In handling this particular case, she showed extreme sensitivity and as a result the case reached its logical conclusion in a short time," Jaiswal told PTI."She has been very good at work and 'Union Home Minister's Medal for Excellence in Investigation' just proves that. Only 150 police officials, many of whom at senior ranks in central agencies, have got this. So it is a matter of pride for us," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/medal-of-excellence-for-up-cop-who-got-infant-s-rapist-convicted-in-34-days-101628863859951.html
13-08-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Not a few of our favourite things||Now that Mumbai’s local train services are on the verge of cranking up their operations again, albeit only to vaccine-certified commuters, it would not be wrong to say that the lifeblood of the city will begin to flow once more. Mumbai’s trains, after all, are more than just a means of transport for over seven million or so of the city’s daily commuters. They are also a metaphor of the determination and resolve of the city, an epitome of the famous “do-or-die, come-what-may” spirit that it has long been associated with, connecting far-flung dreams and aspirations, as they make their heaving, gritty, overcrowded run up and down 150 stations and 390kms across the city’s corners. So, it would not be wrong to say that Mumbai runs when its trains run. But even as the city begins to slowly resume its routines and its rituals and there appears to be a great urge to return to “the good old days and ways”, it would not be wrong to pause for a moment and reflect on some of the more disagreeable and unattractive factors of the way things once were in Mumbai — things and ways we hope we never go back to again: in short, a compilation of what’s NOT a few of our favourite things: * Mumbai’s congested, unsafe, unventilated and outdated local trains. The citizens of Mumbai deserve better — much better; and hopefully, with a new Metro on the anvil and the promise of modern, better-designed, plusher, air-conditioned trains, the sight of commuters being squashed like sweaty shrimps at Sassoon Dock, or hanging on for dear life by the skin of their teeth on rusty railings, or riding on rooftops becomes a thing of the past. * The sight of garbage piled high on Mumbai’s streets and the ignominy of litter-strewn and paan-stained public spaces that we have come to accept as part of our city for so long. This is something we hope we will not return to. BMC are you listening? * Those endlessly long traffic jams that blight the city’s every waking hour, accompanied by the unceasing, relentless drone of honking cars and the fetid, lethal, brown smoke they emit. Now that we are on the verge of getting back to pre-pandemic normalcy, we are certainly not looking forward to these symbols of “normalcy”. * The outrage of ambulances not being given right of way as they attempt to rush the sick and dying to hospitals and help. * The daily parade of those inexhaustible VIP cavalcade accompanying politicians, which interminably hold up traffic and free flow of life and business for the average citizen. * The transgressions of authoritarianism: Policemen lathi-charging peaceful protestors; building watchmen bullying hapless taxi drivers; doormen of five-star hotels rudely ejecting people who don’t appear “well-heeled enough” are some of the things we are certainly not looking forward to returning to. * Public displays of discourteousness and boorishness: People rushing out of cinemas while the credits still run; self-styled VIPs breaking queues because they assume they are entitled to; the unholy rush for the front row of fashion and awards shows; the babel of people barking instructions to their drivers on their cell phones as soon as a plane lands are some of the extreme signs of entitlement and rudeness that we could do without. * Rich people expending enormous amounts of time and energy bargaining with poor street side vendors of fruits and vegetables, as though their lives depended on it, just to score a point when they’ve just blown up several thousand at established and overpriced stores, without batting an eyelid. * Flashy “art openings” where no one is interested in the art, or even the artist, but are too busy posing for pictures and networking. * Society parties where people air kiss and say “we must catch up” when no one has any intention of doing so. * Those infernal photo walls that have become a staple at any and every city event, where one is required to queue up to pose for a photo, so that even if no one recalls your presence at the party, least of all your host, there is an official record of the tedium. * The sight of rows of sleep-deprived, cold and often starving drivers, waiting in their cars way past midnight, outside on empty dark streets, while their employers party cozily till the cows come home, upstairs and indoors. * The cringe-inducing adulation for Bollywood and even its tiniest “celebrities” by hosts and hostesses, while ignoring the truly talented and worthy such as doctors, scientists and humanitarians, who get pushed aside in the clamour. * Public displays of virtue signalling: Socialites who use philanthropy as a photo-op; politicians who plant trees on one day of the year, while cheerfully sanctioning the destruction of wooded acres for the rest of the year; businessmen who use CSR as a means of burnishing their halos — you know the drift, we’re certainly not looking forward to returning to all that. * The Hallmark-isation of every single calendar date and the giddy social media greetings that they foster is one of the things we hope the new normal will not bring back. * The merry-go-round of recycled gifts that accompany all festivals, where one box of stale cashew nuts or mithai can be sent on an endless journey between five to six homes, before it’s returned to its original sender. * Those meaningless, OTT and stress-inducing dress codes for social events: “Glitter and Gold”; “Scintillating Sparkle” and “Black and White and Red All Over”, which ensure that guests have to jump through hoops to be acceptably attired. * The eyesore of families feasting on gargantuan meals at restaurants, while their nannies sit minding the kids, with barely a morsel on their plates * The astronomical budgets spent on flower arrangements at weddings and social events which could be put to better use to help people in need of basic amenities. * That feeling of apathy, irresponsibility and disconnectedness that prevents Mumbaiites from reaching out beyond themselves and their immediate situations, to embrace the city that has afforded them their lives and livelihoods. So, there you have it gentle reader, 20 of the things that we certainly are not looking forward to returning to, now that things are getting back to the way they once were. What’s on your list? We’d love to know…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-not-a-few-of-our-favourite-things-101628862714793.html
13-08-2021||Pune||Water level of Peshwe lake in Katraj lowered to avoid flooding of Ambil Odha||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to keep Nanasaheb Peshwe lake, popularly known as Katraj lake, at half its capacity during the monsoon season to thwart any flood-like situation in the area. The move is to avoid flooding in Ambil Odha, caused due to overflowing of Katraj lake, which flows from the city’s southern parts. Heavy rains in the past has led to overflowing of Katraj lake and Ambil Odha and caused a loss of life and property in Katraj, Bibwewadi, Satara road, Katraj-Kondhwa road, Sahakarnagar and Sinhgad road. The lake, known for its popularity as a tourist destination, was filled to capacity on August 13 last year. “We are keeping the water level down by three metres and efforts are taken during the monsoon to avoid flooding of nearby areas,” said PMC junior engineer Shashikanth Nivdekar. A 2019 study by Renu Arora and Prof Milind Gidde, department of environmental education and research, Bharati Vidyapeeth (deemed university), had stated that the lake needs proper management and a treatment process. “Removal of weeds by a natural process is important. The diversion of the drainage line is important. There is a need to place aerators in the lake that may help to control the fish death rates, because they are at an extinct level. If some precautions are taken, the aquatic life of the lake will survive,” the study stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/water-level-of-peshwe-lake-in-katraj-lowered-to-avoid-flooding-of-ambil-odha-101628862234726.html
13-08-2021||Lucknow||Restaurateurs pin hope on weekend business||Struggling on the business front, due to partial corona curfew, the restaurateurs have given thumbs up to the state government’s decision to open markets on Saturday. In absence of weekend business, restaurants were most affected and with the decision they are expecting a faster recovery from losses and also praying for Sunday dine-in to restart soon. During the Saturday-Sunday closure restaurants were only allowed online delivery. However, many of them were felicitating takeaways but not entertaining dining. “Fridays had become the new Sundays during the weekend closures but since it’s a full working day it was not that impactful. We turned down multiple requests for bookings on weekend. Now, since we will be open on all Saturdays, we expect families to pour in, of course amid Covid-norms,” says Manoj Bachhani of Richi Rich restaurant. Kamli Bristo, which opened just before the second wave, is now pinning hope on the weekend business. “We opened our doors but had to close within few days. After we restarted, we were missing on the weekend sales. We hope the 10 pm night curfew is now relaxed and on Sundays too dine-in is allowed as we have suffered a lot due to closure,” says its owner Ankita Srivastava. Telecom professional Manish Srivastava is happy that after five-days of hectic office routine he will have a day where he can take his family for an outing. “We can now visit mall and dine-out which was closed for months due to the corona curfew.” No curfew on Saturdays came as a blessing for Sky Glass Brewing Co that was recently opened at a city mall. “It’s an additional day for people who want to spend quality time with family after five days of work. Due to the corona curfew people had no option but stay back at home. Now, they will get to enjoy at places that have good ambience, amazing food and ample space where social distancing norms could be followed as safety is the key for all of us,” says its CEO Neeraj Kataria. Omair Saeed, owner of two-week old Mughlai food joints The Latif’s, hopes that the decision will give boost to his newly opened venture. “As it is Mondays and Tuesdays are very low. Weekends are when people look forward to eating out. Now they have an option to relish our tasty delicacies on Saturdays as well. Presently we are closed on Sunday as dine-in is not allowed but once that starts, we will be fully on track,” says the youngster.

Currently, busy doing Punjabi projects, he has plans to excel there before jumping on the Bollywood bandwagon. “My forefathers are from Punjab and then my grandfather shifted to Powayan in UP. So, Punjabi lingo and folk came naturally to me. Main yahin (Chandigarh) main reh kar itni shiddat se kaam karna chahta hoon ki Bollywood se khud call aa jaye,” says the 22-year-old singer. Last year, he released his debut single Mere Jinna Pyaar and his second independent song Speciality that crossed 1 million views in two weeks. The singer, originally named Virender Singh, initially wanted to become an actor. “Since a kid, I wanted to become an actor. When I was 12, I went alone to Delhi to train under Asmita Theatre Group founder Arvind Gaur. He asked me to get an initial training in my hometown which is a hub of theatre and gave me example of Rajpal Yadav who has made our city proud,” he recalls. He returned and joined theatre group Abhivyakti Natya Manch under Shamim Azad. “Since a kid, my mother always calls me Hira, so I made it my screen name. I worked backstage and then acted in plays like Virasat, Dara-Sikoh and Sparatcus. Slowly, I got interested in music. I also composed music for plays like Ek Prayas, Katha Ek Kans Ki and others,” he shares. In 2018, he moved to Punjab for formal training in music. “I learned music from Ustad Baldeep Singh Balli and Ustad Harvinder Bittu. Then I have worked on folk music of UP and Punjab as it’s very rich in folk. There may be a difference in language but emotions in folk are same everywhere which I try to add in my singing.” The singer is elated that actor Rajpal Yadav, film maker Vikash Verma (director of No Means No) and others have tweeted praising his song. “Vikashji has even expressed desire to work with me someday. Seeing the response, labels are also approaching me. Now, I just want to focus more on my singles and utilize my theatre training to be in front of the camera for my videos,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/i-want-to-be-noticed-in-bollywood-for-my-independent-songs-hira-101628860734115.html

The move comes after the chief commissioner, central GST, Lucknow zone last month wrote a letter in this regard to the commercial tax department urging it to get the issue examined and provide feedback at the earliest. With the communiqué, he also attached a letter received from the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau (CEIB). In a circular to all zonal additional commercial tax commissioners on August 11, additional commissioner (administration) Sudha Verma asked officials to give their feedback, with regard to their zone, to the headquarters as desired by the office of commissioner, CGST. “We have issued instructions to zonal commissioners, asking them to ensure necessary action in the matter,” she said confirming and added that the GST wing was dealing with the issue. In order to augment their production and availability and to meet the rising demand, the central government, on April 23, decided to grant full exemption from basic customs duty (BCD) and health cess on import of the items related to oxygen and oxygen related equipment for a period of three months with immediate effect. The CEIB, in its letter that the commissioner (CGST) annexed with his communication to the commercial tax department, said the intelligence available in the bureau indicated that some unscrupulous entities engaged in import of fingertip pulse oximeter were claiming ineligible BCD exemption. The centre’s notification, according the letter, provided for exemption from whole of customs duty levied at the currently applicable rate of 7.5% ad valorem and whole of the cess levied thereon artificial respiration or other therapeutic respiration apparatus (ventilators). The fingertip pulse oximeter, the bureau pointed out, did not qualify the exemption criteria fixed in the notification. Pointing out that the illegal availing of BCD exemption had resulted in short payment of customs duty, the bureau said it was gathered that the same modus operandi was being adopted by importers in respect of fingertip pulse oximeter by wrong declaration of the same in order to get inadmissible exemption at various cargo complexes. “Fingertip pulse oximeter is not an artificial respiration apparatus or ventilator and is used as an instrument to measure the amount of oxygen present in a person’s blood stream and hence does not get covered under the notification No 20/2020-customs, dated 09.04.2020, which is applicable to artificial respiration or other therapeutic respiration apparatus (ventilators),” said the bureau in its letter of May 25, adding “Therefore, the exemption of BCD availed on fingertip pulse oximeter is irregular.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/probe-to-find-out-if-cos-availed-illegal-exemption-on-pulse-oximeter-imports-101628860614121.html
13-08-2021||Delhi||Ensuring mental well-being amid Covid-19||The pandemic has affected almost every aspect of our lives, especially our mental health. Previously considered the lowest-risk age group with regards to medical issues, youngsters have emerged more vulnerable now. And many clinicians are calling attention to a youth mental health crisis. “We have seen a 40% spike in the number of patients complaining of symptoms related to mental health. About 2500 prescriptions every month, as opposed to 1750 prescriptions per month in the pre-pandemic era, are being given to manage symptoms like anxiety, depression, panic attacks, insomnia, and other related symptoms,” says Dr Kushal Banerjee, a senior homeopath from Dr. Kalyan Banerjee’s Clinic. Elaborating on the reason behind this, he says, “People have been indoors for the past 18 months and activities such as watching movies, outdoor games, vacation, that helped to relieve stress are hindered. There is a drastic change in the lifestyle and everyday routine which causes mental health issues. People are not following a disciplinary routine, they wake up till late at night, work till late hours, which leads to an unhealthy routine. Everything has gone digital, from education to entertainment. There used to be a time when people logged in to their work at a certain time, but it is not the case anymore. The professional and personal line has got blurred. The quality time that people used to spend with their family has been affected and more than ever, people should regulate their work-life balance.” Experts feel people need to open up about the challenges they face with their seniors at work for better mental health. “In our always-on world, balance is critical between professional and personal space as we are well aware that the imbalance can toss our lifestyle for the worse,” says psychologist Anuja Kapur who shares some tips to get that balance.1. You can start by maintaining and sticking to a schedule for every day of the week so that you are well aware of the time set for family and work. 2. Be aware that you can unplug every once in a while as this downtime is necessary to rejuvenate the mind and the body due to the stress and tight schedules of the week. 3. Make sure to set time boundaries. Please specify that during working hours you are not to be disturbed until and unless it is genuinely crucial. The same goes for the professional commitments as well try to keep them away from your family time as much as possible.

13-08-2021||Mumbai||State must compensate communities for loss of livelihood by infra projects: Bombay HC||The state is duty bound to compensate the community if its customary right to occupation for earning livelihood is affected by infrastructure projects, the Bombay high court (HC) held on Thursday and directed the Maharashtra government to consider framing a general policy for the payment of compensation to affected communities in such cases. The division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Milind Jadhav held that once a customary right to carry out an occupation for livelihood is affected, the principles enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution of India will come into play. “This forms the basis of the state’s duty to compensate in such cases,” HC observed. With regards to the requirement of the policy, the bench said looking at a clear trend across all the modes of compensating affected persons and expansion of infrastructure and its impact on local communities, the state must consider framing a comprehensive policy for award of compensation to persons whose customary rights of occupation and livelihood are affected by infrastructure projects. “We believe that such a state-wide compensation policy is required not only for fishermen, but for compensating any community whose customary rights to carry out an activity for their livelihood is impacted by government infrastructure projects,” the bench observed. HC also directed the state government to appoint a six-member committee to determine compensation payable to fishermen whose livelihood is affected by construction of Thane Creek Bridge (TCB)-3, a proposed six-lane bridge on Sion-Panvel highway near Vashi. The court was hearing a petition filed by Mariaayi Machhimaar Sahakari Sanstha Maryadit, on behalf of the fishing community from Vashi, Juhu, Koparkhairane, Ghansoli and Diva. The petitioner claimed compensation for the fishermen, contending that they were inhabitants of the Thane creek area and their customary right to fish in the creek was adversely affected by the construction of the third bridge on the creek that connects Mumbai with mainland at Navi Mumbai. Their counsel, advocate Zaman Ali, pointed out how their customary right of fishing was likely to be adversely affected by the third bridge. He submitted that Thane Creek consisted of extensive mudflats along its banks, characterised by the growth of mangroves. Due to the large-scale availability of inter-tidal lands such as mudflats and mangroves, Thane Creek provided an excellent catch of commercial fish and crustaceans. He added, due to the rich ecosystem and biodiversity, the Thane Creek area was declared as flamingo sanctuary in 2015. Ali further pointed out that the proposed bridge will affect 1.4 hectares (ha) of mangrove forest and 6.76ha of CRZ-1 and CRZ-4 areas, comprising fishing areas and mudflats. The construction, Ali said, will involve heavy concretisation and reclamation of land that will block access to fishing routes and navigational channels for fishing activities. Amicus curiae, senior advocate Sharan Jagtiani, supported him by submitting that the bridge will adversely affect the livelihood of the fishing community, causing direct and indirect losses. HC accepted the contentions and observed that the livelihood of the fishing community is dependent on a healthy environment and balanced ecology. The bench said that the destruction of mangroves for TCB-3 will disturb the ecological balance in Thane creek. “The vital role that mangroves play in maintaining ecological balance and sustaining bio-diversity is well-documented. The Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary Management Plan and the Preliminary Report on Bio-diversity of Thane Creek also bear out that the destruction of mangroves often results, inter alia, in loss of biodiversity and reduced fish catch, which in turn would impact livelihood of the fishermen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-must-compensate-communities-for-loss-of-livelihood-by-infra-projects-bombay-hc-101628859954807.html

These juveniles from across the country turned up at the station, without their parents or relatives, seeking work. RPF has formed a squad called “Savitribai Phule Team” to identify, track and rescue these children. According to RPF, the highest number of children rescued, 50, is from Bihar, and the total rescued include 147 boys and 39 girls. “When the train operations resumed last year, we found many children roaming alone at platforms or outside the Pune railway station premises. Many claimed to have run away from home in search of work or after a fight with family. Our special squad, “Savitribai Phule Team”, formed in November last year include six RPF police staff comprising women personnel also,” said RPF Pune divisional security commissioner Uday Singh Pawar. The rescued children hail from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Orissa, Goa, Karnataka, Telangana, Rajasthan and even Nepal. The number of such children coming to Pune in search of work has increased following last year’s countrywide lockdown, according to a RPF official. “Many rescued children cite financial issues at home to be one of the reasons to run away. We are glad to trace them and send them back to their family,” Pawar said. The “Savitribai Phule Team” conducts random rounds of six platforms at Pune station and neighbouring areas. They also travel on various trains that pass through the Pune division to look for unaccompanied minors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rpf-pune-division-s-savitribai-phule-squad-rescues-186-minors-in-last-10-months-101628859953410.html
13-08-2021||Delhi||The pandemic has made us aware of micro cuisines: Vicky Ratnani||We are what we eat, believes celebrity chef Vicky Ratnani. Known for cooking up some of the most indulgent cheat meals, as well as strictly healthy dishes for Bollywood stars, he shares, “People in Bollywood follow strict diets while working. I trained a chef during the filming of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (2013) to cook for actor Farhan Akhtar for five to six months. I have even cooked for Zoya Akhtar. They are both very conscious of what they eat. When Hrithik Roshan was training for Krrish, I helped him source different kinds of food that the trainers recommended.” The chef has always loved food, even before he made a living out of it. “I love food. I didn’t know that I would be taking it up as a profession till I entered college. I was very clear by my second year there that I wanted to be a chef,” he says.Like most authorities on the subject, Ratnani too emphasises that travelling adds a lot of value in the life of someone who likes to cook. “At every 200 kms in our country, food is different. To become a good chef and be able to cook well, one must experience and taste new food. While travelling, you learn not just about food but spices, vegetables and the culture. Each place has its own style and uniqueness of cooking,” he says.The chef believes that the Covid-19 pandemic has affected eating habits, but not everything is bad about this change. He explains, “A lot of people who couldn’t cook were forced to make an attempt, owing to the pandemic. They learned about the importance of minimising food wastage. Being at home, they have had enough time to think about the importance of sustainability.”Another positive change brought about by the health crisis, he feels, is the resurgence in popularity of micro cuisines. “The regional cuisines or micro cuisines such as Sindhi food, Parsi food, Bihari food, North-east food and many others have found the spotlight. Home chefs have been showcasing the variety of dishes through different social media platforms and people love them. Earlier, in the eyes of the layman Bengali food was confused with Bangladeshi food for some strange reason, but now what is happening is the explosion of culture. People know the difference,” opines Ratnani who collaborated with Airbnb India for their Bollywood Insiders Campaign where the chef will host a session called, ‘Cook Bollywood’s Favourite Cheat Meal’.Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/the-pandemic-has-made-us-aware-of-micro-cuisines-vicky-ratnani-101628859774435.html

13-08-2021||Pune||Global village idiot: Why my alma mater must merge to evolve into a media school with impact||Last week I read about protests against the Savitribai Phule Pune University’s move to merge the department of Communication and Journalism at the Ranade Institute on Fergusson College road with the Department of Media and Communication Studies on the main university campus. My first reaction was: yes! A bigger campus and better resources for students. My second reaction was a tinge of sadness at the loss of the sense of history associated with the Ranade Institute.Over the course of the week, I spoke to former classmates, faculty, and industry peers and the conversations made me think. What is the purpose of education? What is the responsibility of an educational institution with respect to its environment and society?Protests from a few quarters probably have merit in the context of their particular perspective - access to journalism education for rural students which is related to fees, given the nature of grant and non-grant courses. These are matters that should be addressed by the university since inclusive education is part of its mandate. There are views about the location being central (argumentative since the SPPU campus is 5km from Ranade). There are questions about inadequate communication or lack of process. A random search on the internet seems to suggest that the university had announced last year its intention to merge not just the department of journalism, but many others. Even at a cursory glance, the exercise seems aimed at organisational efficiency and with intent to providing students the benefit of shared resources, not to mention opportunities that come to larger institutions. The administration could probably adopt a more transparent approach to achieve wider consensus.The university has a mandate beyond the interest of particular groups, and it definitely has a responsibility much larger than protecting a way of academic life or protecting sections within society: it has to contribute an educational infrastructure that prepares society to address at least the foreseeable changes that will affect our world.I was at Ranade Institute as a student of the Bachelor’s programme in 1996-97. In the subsequent 25 years, I have visited the department to meet faculty and friends, and also as a guest lecturer. And the department is pretty much as it was when I was a student, which doesn’t augur well for aspiring students, since the facilities and technology resources are from 25 years ago. Pune has a fantastic history in leading the way in the development of journalism and in establishing educational standards in the field of media and related communication. Most of that fantastic track record is more than half-a-century old. The merger of a journalism department with the department of communication and media studies is pretty much a question from the previous century. The world’s leading universities have consolidated related subjects under the Communication and Media studies head. And while there are many Top 10 and Top 50 lists depending on criteria, when one looks for a graduate or master’s programme in journalism or media studies nowadays, what is not in dispute is the diversity of academic resources, including curriculum, industry connect and technology infrastructure at the college/university. The University of Amsterdam, Stanford, London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), University of California at Berkeley, NYU, Nanyang Technological University Singapore, are consistently in Top 10 lists for journalism and media studies. And these are all constantly redefining themselves because they are acutely aware of the rapidly evolving educational landscape.Technology and new-age platforms have blurred the very strong erstwhile lines between native and mainstream language journalisms, as also altered the very nature of what is cosmopolitan and what is not. Today, I can blog, podcast and videocast reports and opinions in English, Marathi, Bengali and Hindi for different audiences if I so desire, and my ability to do so seamlessly provides me with a much wider audience than a niche language segment. And all I need is a decent smartphone. What does not change is the ethical and legal parameters of what constitutes good journalism or common good, as opposed to a singular opinion for the sake of a singular opinion. While a lot has been written and said about technology and curriculum, in the early 1990s it was the University of Florida’s journalism school that launched what was believed to be the world’s first journalism website. Media organisation (as in industry), followed a little later (by the early 2000s Telegraph, BBC Online, Guardian Unlimited had built significant online presences). The Associated Press was among the first movers into multimedia content (including audio and video), beginning the blurring of the line between print and broadcast. Around 2004, audible.com came onto the scene focusing on the spoken-word versions of news and editorial opinion. The list goes on and in the last five years, with the proliferation of social media the lines itself have merged between print and broadcast and audio and online journalism, not to mention the very real redesign of what is news, what is media and what is communication for the public good?Today, the questions in front of journalists are different, and in the very near future their preoccupations will be different and most of it will be related to identifying their niche audiences and addressing only those (as opposed to addressing all audiences, which social media is much better at with its AI-driven processes). Equipping media students and professionals with the required competencies to function in the current (and future) communication landscape requires educational departments to be aware of and functioning in those environments, and being able to leverage the larger scale of organisational resources available within an umbrella. The merger is a welcome initiative as a first step for the university to catch up with the digital age, so that students from different parts of Maharashtra can access a better quality of journalism education so that they are equipped to understand and report on the rapidly changing world that we live in.Mukherjee, author, learning-tech designer and management consultant, is founder of Mountain Walker and chief strategy advisor, Peak Pacific.

The situation in Rajouri turned tense on Friday morning after a clash broke out between the police and people demanding action against those behind the attack. An angry mob burned tyres and shouted slogans against the police and civil administration. “Both the communities observed a complete shutdown in protest against the cowardly attack on the house of the BJP leader,” said a resident, requesting anonymity. He said that there was no untoward incident during the shutdown. BJP functionary Jasbir Singh (36)’s three-and-a-half-year old nephew was killed, while he, his parents and three other relatives sustained injuries after a grenade was allegedly thrown at his residence in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K)’s Rajouri district late on Thursday, police said.

The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) has earmarked 350 acres of land for the first medical device park in Uttar Pradesh and the largest in North India.In order to expedite the production of medical equipment, the state government will allot ready sheds to the industries. The park will be built in two phases. In the first phase, sheds will be built on 125 acres of land while in the second phase, sheds will be built on the rest of 225 acres.With the help of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, an incubation centre will also be constructed over five acres of land at the medical device park. Touted as the special feature of the medical device park in Noida, the incubation centre will provide startups with facilities such as business and technical facilities, mentorship, early development funds, networks and relationships, cooperative spaces, laboratory facilities, mentoring and advisory support.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath pitched Lucknow and Noida as two centres for establishing the parks after the Central government announced its decision to set up four medical device parks across the country. The chief minister argued that exports from Noida, one of the most developed industrial areas of the country, will get easier in future with the opening of the Jewar Airport.The Adityanath-led UP government has also sought allotment of two bulk pharmaceutical, or medical device parks to UP for the favourable environment created for investors due to the new industrial and pharma policy of the Central Government. Once approved, the medical device park will get a grant of about ₹100 crores from the Central government.India’s dependence on China for raw materials of medicines and its shortage following the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak prompted the ministry of health and family welfare and concerned departments to promote the Make in India programme in the medical field by setting up pharma and medical devices parks, according to the UP government.A few months back, YEIDA officials visited a similar medical device park in Visakhapatnam to get the minute details about the infrastructure. They have also prepared a detailed project report on the medical device park at Kalam Institute, Hyderabad, which will form the basis for the setting up of the park in Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-to-get-350-acre-medical-device-park-provide-employment-to-20-000-people-101628854137684.html

Ajay Pandit and Sanjay Pujari, the main priests of the temple, said the ritual was delayed by half an hour because of the visit of the BJP leaders. The two said they were stopped from entering the temple when the BJP leaders prayed.Another priest of the temple said the BJP leaders arrived around 3am and worshipped at sanctum sanctorum by offering milk and water to the deity on the occasion Naagpanchami. The temple administration locked gates and turned off the CCTV cameras as there was a ban on entry of any person into the sanctum sanctorum during Bhasm Aarti.Also Read | Most pollution control boards across India lack transparency, finds study Pandit said he stood outside the gate as he was also not allowed to go inside the temple for 45 minutes. “The VIP darshan broke the protocol of the temple.

The administration was so secretive about the VIP darshan that they locked all the gates.”Pandit said he will raise the matter with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to resolve this issue of “VIP darshan”. Pujari, who performed the aarti, said the system of VIP darshan is not a good idea.Dinesh Jaiswal, the officer in charge of the temple who ordered the locking of temple gates, said he received an order and just followed it. “I will not say anything else on it.”Vijayvargiya refused to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/devotees-not-allowed-but-vijayvargiya-bjp-leaders-attend-ritual-at-mp-temple-101628852513445.html
13-08-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal Congress MLAs boycott assembly, demand Speaker’s removal||The opposition Congress boycotted the proceedings on the last day of the Himachal Pradesh assembly’s monsoon session on Friday and staged a walkout, seeking the removal of Speaker Vipin Singh Parmar for showing allegiance to the RSS ideology. Also read: Kinnaur landslide toll reaches 16 with recovery of two more bodiesThe Congress members walked out after leaving a copy of the resolution with the Vidhan Sabha secretary soon after the House assembled for the day. Row over RSS ideology The controversy began on Tuesday when Congress MLA Jagat Singh Negi made a remark against the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, triggering pandemonium in the House. The following day when the opposition members wanted to raise the issue, Parmar said the statement against the ideology was unwarranted. He said: “The President, Prime Minister, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and he himself were associated with this ideology. Should I leave this ideology for the opposition?” He said he was in the chair to deliver justice and will do so. On Friday, leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri said all 19 members of the Congress legislature party had given the notice of resolution under Article 179(c) of the Constitution and Rule 274 (1) of the rule of procedure and conduct of business which provides for the removal of the Speaker. “Parmar has failed to uphold the dignity of the House and his office by refusing discussion on notices given by the opposition on important issues pertaining to the masses. His conduct casts a doubt on his integrity and neutrality and goes against the spirit of the Constitution,” he said. He alleged that the Speaker was not being impartial in dealing with the notices of the opposition members. “We, the opposition members have, therefore, no faith in the office of the present Speaker,” he said, demanding his removal. Notice deserves to be rejected: Minister State parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Bhardwaj condemned the Congress resolution and said that such a notice could only be given under rule 274 of the Vidhan Sabha. “The notice deserves to be rejected as there is no provision in the rules. Such a resolution was brought to gain political mileage, it is against the tradition of the House,” Bhardwaj said. CPM legislator Rakesh Singha said the House should adopt the middle path. “I have all respect for your chair but what happened in the House was not in good taste,” said Singha but he did not support the resolution brought by Bhardwaj. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said the Congress ddid not have adequate numbers to support the resolution. According to the rules, such a resolution can only be brought 14 days after the notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-congress-mlas-boycott-assembly-demand-speaker-s-removal-101628849633267.html

Adil Mirza, who has been rescuing snakes for the last 15 years and now works with the forest department, said the forest department got a rescue call about a small cobra in an industrial unit premises in Vikas Nagar area of the district on Thursday. “DFO Kalsi instructed me to go and rescue the cobra. When I went there, I was surprised as it was a two-headed spectacled cobra. In my 15 years as a snake catcher, I have never come across such a specimen. It is a very rare snake,” he said. Also Read | Earthquake measuring 3.8 on Richter scale hits Uttarakhand’s capital DehradunMirza said the length of the cobra is around one-and-a-half feet and it seemed less than two weeks old. BB Martolia, DFO Kalsi, said the rare cobra has been sent to a rescue centre at the Dehradun zoo, where veterinary doctors will check it. “After doctors check it, it will be decided whether to release the snake or keep it for a study. Such snakes rarely survive in wild,” he said. Vipul Maurya, wildlife expert from Wildlife Institute of India (WII), who has been part of the state forest department’s herpetological surveys in the state, said it is a very rare specimen. “Till now, I have not come across any such specimen in the state. This is also called bicephally and is caused by some genetic mutation. Very little is known about such snakes, whether they survive in the wild for long or not,” he said. Due to the ongoing monsoon season, snakes are being spotted in and around residential areas in the state. Earlier this year, a team of researchers from Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and Forest Research Institute (FRI), Dehradun, led by scientists Abhishek Das and Amit Kumar from WII had confirmed the existence of a rare black-bellied coral snake, the smallest of the cobra family, which was spotted in the forests of Nainital and Mussoorie. Last year, a rare red coral kukri snake was spotted thrice in Uttarakhand’s US Nagar and Nainital districts and rescued by forest officials. According to forest officials, the rare snake was first spotted in Lakhimpur Kheri area of Uttar Pradesh in 1936 from where it got its scientific name ‘Oligodon kheriensis’. In August last year, forest officials in Dehradun rescued a 15.4-foot-long king cobra snake from Jamunwala area, claiming it was the largest king cobra they had ever rescued in the district so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/rare-two-headed-cobra-rescued-in-uttarakhand-s-dehradun-101628849213115.html

There are 300 of them. Most parents said they don’t wish to send their daughters to school from August 16.”As a result, both the schools have decided to continue with only online classes in days to come.Looking at the poor response, both the schools have decided to continue with online classes. At La Martiniere College, out of 1,250 parents of class 9 to 12 students, only 150 have given their consent to send their children for physical classes, said principal Carlyle McFarland.

Meenakshi Bahadur, principal, Study Hall School said, “We are calling only 50% of strength so we don’t need two shifts. Online classes will continue for the students who are not attending school physically.”Dr Urvashi Sahni, founder president & CEO, Study Hall Educational Foundation, said,” We are getting written consent from parents. 53% have consented and the numbers are growing. The rest are hesitant because of fear.” Mala Mehra, principal of Hoerner College, and secretary, UP Private Schools Association (UPSA) said, “Around 40% of schools staff of UPSA members have been fully vaccinated while 70 % staff have received one shot of the vaccine.” Claiming that over 60% parents have given their consent, Mehra said Hoerner College will reopen from August 16.Parents maintain they would prefer online classes. Pawan Kumar Acharya, astrologer and author who is father of a class 11 student said, “I have decided to not give consent for my son to go to school till he is vaccinated.”Shikha Sharma, mother of another class 11 girl, said, “I think it will be a risk sending students to schools when we are hearing about the third wave...I have not given my consent for my child to go to school. I will wait for a few more months before thinking about it as per the Covid-19 conditions then.”Meanwhile, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma has expressed confidence over the decision of reopening of schools. “We have held meeting with the district inspector of schools and school managements...The education department will remain in touch with the health department regarding the third wave of the pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-to-open-schools-for-classes-9-12-parents-reluctant-to-send-wards-101628825870874.html

13-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A new anthology of pakodas||Icons are in a shift. Delhi’s Central Vista is changing, and Delhi’s Khandani Pakodawala is changing too. This legendary place has been making a dozen different kinds of pakodas since 1962.But, this evening, as cook Bhupinder Sahu tucks out the various pakodas from his oil-filled cauldron, his giant ladle has something new. It’s a spring roll.“We introduced it six months ago,” says the cook, his face covered in a pink mask.Nobody instinctively relates spring rolls to batter-coated pakodas — they are more commonly found in East Asian restaurants. But here, these crispy rolls are harmoniously intermingling with the traditional pakodas. After all, spring rolls too are deep-fried and packed with stuffing, just as any self-respecting pakoda.And yet it will be unfair to recommend this place just for spring rolls. You ought to experience it along at least one specimen of all the fries on offer — paneer pakoda, soya stick, veg chop, aloo tikki, palak-methi-pyaz pakoda, bread pakoda, baingan pakoda, pyaaz pakoda, aloo-mattar seekh, gobhi pakoda, sweet corn pakoda, mix veg pakoda, and hari mirch pakoda. Sadly, this evening the deep-fried ram laddu is already over.Served with green chutney, the bread pakoda is rectangular, the pyaaz pakoda is round, and the cauliflower pakoda is lumpy. The so-called seekh kebab is a fried roll of channa dal, green peas and potato. Despite being treated with piquant spices such as ajwain, methi and jeera, the gobhi pakoda retains the vegetable’s delicious raw flavour. The pyaaz pakoda is like a secret; beneath the golden brown crust sits the whole pyaaz, translucent, soft and strangely sweet.In these days of pandemic, impatient customers are exercising heroic restraint in front of the counter, and try not to push each other while making their choices. Nevertheless, the chaos of the pre-pandemic era is still tangible.Inside, the kitchen is quiet. The aforementioned Mr Sahu is alone, frying the pakodas in a huge cauldron. A Bihar native from Madhubani, he has been in the shop for 40 years. On the wall beside him are portraits of Late Shri Kanhya Lal and Late Shri Om Prakash, the pioneering elders of the family that owns the landmark.As its name suggests, the long-time establishment has passed down the generations and continues to thrive. Who knows by next year if it will have fried momos too in its pakoda anthology. Situated in Nauroji Nagar market, the shop is tucked between Sethi Juice Corner and Rajdhani ke Special Swadisht Dahi Bhalla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-new-anthology-of-pakodas-101628802898375.html
13-08-2021||Delhi||Medal for Delhi cops who probed Batla House encounter, riots||Seven Delhi Police personnel, including an inspector who investigated the 2008 Batla House encounter, and three officers who were part of the 2020 Delhi riots investigation, have been awarded the Union home minister’s medal for excellence in investigation, Delhi police said on Thursday.Police said ACP Sandeep Lamba and inspector Gurmeet Singh, both among the medal recipients, were injured when a mob assaulted them at main Wazirabad Road in north-east Delhi on February 24, 2020. Delhi police said that this was the first case of “unprovoked mass” violence in which many police personnel were injured and head constable Rattan Lal was murdered. Police said 22 people were arrested in the case by using video stabilisation technology.“Both the officers have been rewarded for their efforts and perseverance to make a watertight case against accused persons,” Delhi police said in a statement.Inspector Amaleshwar Kumar Rai, who probed the murder of intelligence bureau officer Ankit Sharma during the Delhi riots has also been awarded the medal.To be sure, the cases of the Delhi riots are still in the trial stage at the city courts. Delhi police have been criticised for their riots investigation and arresting students and activists who were part of the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests. Police have maintained that the riots were orchestrated by many prominent faces of the CAA protests, a charge that has been denied vehemently by the arrested students and activists.Inspector Satish Sharma who investigated the Batla House encounter was awarded the medal posthumously.Another officer chosen for the medal is DCP KPS Malhotra for investigations during his stint at the Narcotics Control Bureau. Malhotra probed Bollywood actors for their alleged role in drug cases that came to light after actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. Malhotra is attached to police commissioner Rakesh Asthana’s office.Others who won the medal were inspector Domica Purty, for solving a 2020 rape case, inspector Virender Singh for probing the DDA land pooling fraud and DCP Harsh Vardhan for solving recruitment scam in Arunachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/medal-for-delhi-cops-who-probed-batla-house-encounter-riots-101628802708671.html

According to a senior official, the decision has been taken after the guidelines issued by UAE’s National Emergency and Crisis Management Authority (NCEMA) which allowed conditional entry to the travellers from India. Every year, around 400,000 passengers fly to the UAE from Delhi airport.The facility will have 50 rapid PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing machines, and the firm is looking at doubling the number of units depending on demand. A test will cost ₹5,000 at the centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/wait-times-for-covid-19-tests-at-delhi-airport-halved-101628802646034.html
13-08-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: Chandigarh should revert to chief commissioner model||A Chinese proverb says “May you live in interesting times”. My stint in the Chandigarh administration of almost nine years—first as deputy commissioner-cum-estate officer and subsequently as home secretary—was indeed an interesting, rewarding and satisfying experience. During these nine years of serving the people of the city, I worked in close coordination with five governors and five advisers.Ever since its inception, Chandigarh has remained the joint capital of two states of Punjab and Haryana. The UT administration was a mix of Indian Administrative Services officers drawn from the AGMU, Punjab and Haryana cadres—headed by a serving officer designated as the chief commissioner, who was assisted by the home secretary and the finance secretary.During the insurgency in Punjab, the Centre had decided that for ensuring better coordination with the Punjab government, the charge of UT administrator should be given to the governor of Punjab and the post of chief commissioner was relegated to the adviser.However, this system created many problems. One, the decision-making became slow since an additional tier was created. Even though some of the functions of the administrator were delegated to the adviser, the major policy decisions and statutory approvals were required to be taken at the higher level. Further, the Raj Bhawan being almost out of bounds for the common man, made it increasingly difficult for the masses to meet the administrator for grievance redressal.Sometimes even the Chandigarh Member of Parliament would find it difficult to get an appointment with the administrator at a short notice, which was not at all difficult when chief commissioners were heading city governance.Now that there is normalcy in Punjab, there is an ongoing debate going on for a long time as to whether we should revert to the chief commissioner model. The last few years have seen a manifold increase in the population of Chandigarh, the demographics are changing and so are the aspirations of people. They want quick and better governance on all fronts.Being the capital city of two states, Chandigarh is not a normal UT. It needs to safeguard the interests of both the states. And it becomes even more complicated when there is an ongoing tussle between both the states over their share in controlling the UT.Governing a UT is akin to governing a state. Only those Punjab governors who were former chief ministers or a Union minister or had the experience of leading the country’s armed forces have been effective in administering Chandigarh well. Some of these governors were quite proactive and they started sitting in the room in the Secretariat earmarked for the administrator, which provided a window to hear the grievances of the residents. Very few past governors have visited the Secretariat as a normal routine.Running UT a full-time jobRunning a union territory is a full-time job: if the governor of Punjab is entrusted with the responsibility of the administrator, governance is bound to suffer.The additional charge of administrator given to the Punjab governor has also remained a bone of contention between both the state governments. One of the former chief ministers of Haryana used to advocate that the post of administrator should be rotated between the governors of both the states.So in my considered opinion and past experience, and in the interest of better governance, the responsibility of the UT administrator should revert to the chief commissioner, who should be a serving IAS officer having seniority equivalent to that of the secretary to Government of India or equivalent.Further in the interest of stability, he should have a fixed tenure of 2-3 years. That will not only meet the demands of the people of Chandigarh but will also help in achieving the aims of good governance while meeting the objective of ‘minimum government, maximum governance’.(The writer is a retired IAS officer who has served as home secretary and deputy commissioner-cum-estate officer of the UT administration)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-chandigarh-should-revert-to-chief-commissioner-model-101628801988990.html

13-08-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: Empower residents for better decision-making in Chandigarh||Chandigarh was made a Union Territory in 1966 at the time of partition of Punjab. Earlier, Chandigarh was a part of Kharar tehsil and the Shah Commission, on whose recommendation the division of areas was done, had recommended the entire Kharar tehsil to be given to Haryana. However, the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi gave Kharar tehsil to Punjab but Chandigarh along with 23 villages was made a Union Territory, directly under the administration of the central government. Till 1984, the UT of Chandigarh had the chief commissioner at the top of the administrative structure. In 1984 the then Congress government abolished the post of chief commissioner and appointed the governor of Punjab as an ex officio administrator of Chandigarh, and the system is continuing till date. The post of chief commissioner was redesignated as adviser to the administrator. In 55 years, Chandigarh has seen two patterns of administration, one led by the chief commissioner for about 18 years, and one led by the administrator for about 34 years. No continuity or accountability Both the systems have their own positive and negative aspects. To my mind, the question is not who is to rule Chandigarh; but how Chandigarh should be ruled. Unfortunately, under both the set-ups, power is vested with officers to take decisions regarding Chandigarh. The officers keep on shifting and hence there is neither any continuity nor any accountability at the top. This was the position under both the systems. The urgent need of the hour is to ensure public participation, both political and non-political as well as elected and non-elected representatives in the decision-making process. On issues concerning Chandigarh the final say in decision-making should be that of public representatives and not officers alone, like in other states. The Municipal Corporation Chandigarh which was constituted for the first time in 1996 has completed 25 years of existence. There is a need to review the working of the MC and move further towards either mayor in council or metropolitan council with more powers to public representatives. Chandigarh has a large number of people both, retired and working, who have vast experience in public life and civic management. Their services should also be used in decision-making. Effective coordination in tricity The tricity of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula has grown to such an extent that you don’t even come to know to when you have entered Punjab or Haryana. But if there is even an innocuous move of changing any administrative structure of these three units, there will be a hue and cry by politicians. Problems such as transport, population and residence, concerning the three can be solved by effective coordination among the authorities. There is an urgent need for making the Interstate Development Council, consisting of representatives from Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, more effective for the overall development of the tricity. The only difference between the two systems is that earlier it was the chief commissioner (now redesignated as adviser to the administrator) who was at the top of the bureaucratic structure. In the new system, it is the Punjab governor who is at the helm. The other structure remains the same. Therefore, in my view instead of debating on which of the two systems is best for Chandigarh, all concerned should join hands and rising above narrow political consideration strive to evolve a system for the city in which the major say in the decision-making is that of the people instead of bureaucrats, who keep on moving to and from Chandigarh. The territorial dispute between Punjab and Haryana has already caused immense harm to the interest of the region. Let this issue not become a bone of contention between these two states. The time has come when any decision about the administrative set-up in Chandigarh is taken by consensus by involving representatives of Punjab and Haryana also so that in an attempt to solve one problem, we may not create more.(The writer is additional solicitor general at Punjab and Haryana high court and former BJP MP from Chandigarh.

13-08-2021||Chandigarh||They fought off Covid, but their mental health has taken a toll||A 37-year-old man from Panchkula wakes up every night, fearing someone is inserting a tube in his nose. He had contracted Covid-19 in early April and remained under treatment at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, for around 15 days. It’s been over three months since he recovered from the deadly infection, but he has still not been able to have a sound night’s sleep. He says he wakes up every night with “flashes of OT light” and at times, even hears voices.A doctor from Chandigarh, who had contracted the infection a few months ago, spends about two to three hours a day washing hands, fearing she may get infected again if she doesn’t do so. She also feels a compelling need to ensure that her shoes are placed outside in a proper manner.Both of them are among several others who successfully fought off the deadly viral infection but are now left battling neuro-psychiatric issues post recovery. While the 37-year-old has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, the doctor is found to be suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder. PGIMER’s psychiatry department head Dr D Basu said a good proportion (10% to 40%) of Covid-19 patients continue to have symptoms after four weeks. These symptoms could be physical and neuro-psychiatric.He said in 50% of the cases, patients report fatigue, while in 40% cases, they complain of headaches. “One in four (25%) patients shows symptoms of anxiety, depression and brain fog (cognitive slippage). In 1-2% cases, people will have post-traumatic stress disorder, further in rare cases, people will have psychotic disorders such as hearing voices,” he said.Dr MP Sharma, in-charge, district mental health programme, said, “For those who had depression and anxiety before they contracted Covid, the severity of their condition has increased. But for many, it is for the first time that mental health issues have come to fore.”Dr Sharma said there has been a massive increase in mental health cases during the second wave. The psychiatry OPD of the General Hospital, Sector 6, has seen a 10 to 20% increase in mental health cases, and most patients are found to be having a history of Covid infection.Dr Manoj Kumar, in-charge, psychiatry department, said: “Every day 100-200 patients visit the psychiatry OPD, of which up to 10% are those who have post Covid issues.” He said majority of the patients have anxiety, whereas others are found suffering from depression. “Their sleep pattern has been distributed. They complain of irritability, palpitations, breathlessness and other anxiety-related symptoms,” said the doctor. About reasons, he said: “Covid times are tough. People are seeing a lot of lifestyle change. Those who get infected with the virus, suffer more. At times, your surroundings and social life also determines the impact such a deadly virus may leave on you.”Dr Kumar suggested that people should consult a doctor when their change in behaviour starts impacting their personal or professional life.Dr Basu said people with pre-existing mental health conditions such as depression are at higher risk of mortality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/they-fought-off-covid-but-their-mental-health-has-taken-a-toll-101628800728463.html

13-08-2021||Chandigarh||Akali Dal demands independent probe into gangster’s treatment at Batala hospital||The Shiromani Akali Dali (SAD) on Thursday demanded an independent probe by a sitting judge of the high court or a CBI inquiry into the medical treatment given to a gangster at a private hospital in Batala.Happy Shah, a close associate of notorious gangster Jagdeep Singh, alias Jaggu Bhagwanpuria, was treated at the hospital after he had sustained a bullet injury in a retaliatory fire when he along with his three aides had gunned down history sheeter Rana Kandowalia in Amritsar. Addressing a press conference in Amritsar, party leader and former minister Bikram Singh Majithia produced CCTV footage showing how the gangster was treated at the hospital. “Some Congress leaders close to certain cabinet ministers managed to get the gangster treated at the hospital,” he claimed. The SAD leader said due action should be taken against the hospital management besides arresting the absconding accused. He also produced video footage claiming the gangster was escorted out of the hospital from the back gate after his treatment.The SAD had been highlighting the gangster- police-jail administration nexus for the last four-and-a-half years, he said. “The Congress government had facilitated the shifting of Bhagwanpuria to the Tihar jail in Delhi. Even as Bhagwanpuria has 59 cases registered against him in Punjab, he was allowed to be shifted to Delhi. Even the judge who heard the plea calling for shifting of Bhagwanpuria had said the gangster was running a crime syndicate in the Bathinda jail and was involved in heinous crimes in league with inter -state criminals. Now, he is running a crime syndicate from the Tihar and we are seeing the consequences here in Punjab,” the Akali leader added.Deputy commissioner of police (investigation) Mukhwinder Singh Bhullar, who is leading the investigation into the case, said, “We are verifying the facts about the hospital’s involvement. If anyone is found to be guilty, action will be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akali-dal-demands-independent-probe-into-gangster-s-treatment-at-batala-hospital-101628800128000.html
13-08-2021||Chandigarh||Navjot Sidhu hints at contesting assembly polls from Amritsar East segment||Newly appointed Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Thursday hinted at contesting the upcoming assembly elections from the Amritsar East constituency. This comes amid speculations about his intention to contest from Patiala, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s hometown. Sidhu, who visited his constituency for the inauguration of development works to the tune of ₹42 crore, said he would never leave the holy city that made his family win six times. “People of Amritsar embraced me wholeheartedly. I am ready to sacrifice everything for this land. I owe a lot to this city. We won’t be able to repay this debt even if 21 generations of our family try to do so,” said Sidhu while addressing a gathering at Verka where his team and the district administration filled forms for providing pucca houses.” It was Sidhu’s maiden visit to his segment after he was appointed the state Congress chief.“People say an election is fought by spending ₹8 to ₹15 crore. I have fought five elections from Amritsar by spending only ₹47 lakh. I consider the people of Amritsar my lord,” Sidhu said.About development in the constituency, the cricketer-turned-politician said one can compare works during the 10-year tenure of his and his wife with the previous regimes. “We have spent huge funds to develop our constituency,” he added. “In the upcoming assembly session, all the power purchase agreements (PPAs) with private players will be annulled. People who have been paying ₹12 to 17 for per unit of electricity will get the same at ₹3 to 5,” he added. “There will be no compromise with those involved in drug smuggling. A resolution will be brought in the session to make public the police’s report on drugs,” he added. The Congress government in Punjab will also enact the state’s own laws to counter the Centre’s anti-farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/navjot-sidhu-hints-at-contesting-assembly-polls-from-amritsar-east-segment-101628800011133.html

The accused are Nishu Chaudhary and Jatinder Singh, both varsity employees, and Akashdeep Singh, Sonu Kumar, Harpreet Singh, Vinay and Nisha Sharma, who were shown as beneficiaries of fake bills. Urban Estate police station in-charge Ronnie Singh said the lookout notices have been issued to ensure that the accused don’t fly out of the country and arrest them at the earliest. “Multiple teams at work to trace the suspects. Police across the state have been briefed about the suspects,” the station house officer (SHO) said.A case was lodged against the seven on August 1 on a complaint filed by the varsity management but the accused have been evading arrest even as the police carried multiple raids at their possible hideouts. The case was registered under sections 420 (cheating), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant), 465 (for making forged documents), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged), 201 (tempering of evidences) and 381 (theft) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. In May, the university’s internal audit department and the finance wing had red-flagged five bills amounting to ₹6 lakh. The department head’s stamp and signatures were found to be fake and the names of research scholars and assistants against whom the bills were raised also turned out to be bogus. A committee comprising registrar Varinder Kaushik, dean (research) Ashok Tiwari and finance officer Rakesh Khurana probed the bank accounts of Nishu Chaudhary, the senior assistant, and the others involved. The help of the university’s forensic department was taken to investigate the fake signatures and stamps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabi-varsity-billing-scam-police-issue-lookout-notices-against-7-absconding-accused-101628799829480.html

13-08-2021||Chandigarh||Soon, pick from pre-designed floor plans to rebuild your CHB independent house||Allottees of Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) independent houses, planning to reconstruct their dwelling units, will soon be able to pick from a set of pre-designed blueprints, ending the need for building plan approvals.More than 600 allottees stand to benefit from the option that CHB is in advanced stage of rolling out.For years, allottees have been seeking permission to demolish and construct their houses anew in view of their dilapidated state or modern requirements, but the current procedure for getting approvals is tedious with multiple stages involved. “For facilitating speedy constructions without bureaucratic delays, the board will offer a set of building plans for every category of independent houses. All these plans will be uploaded on the CHB site and the allottees can choose from one of these,” said Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, CHB.In case the allottee wants to go for a distinct floor plan, they will need to follow the regular procedure of prior building plan approval. In both cases, the allottee will need to obtain the completion certificate from the board.To be ready in a monthThe standardised building plans are in final stage of preparation and are expected to be available in a month. “The architectural branch is working on finalising the plans as soon as possible. These will be uploaded on the CHB website after approval of the board chairman,” said Garg.Notably, the board had passed the proposal for standardised plans in December last year. These were then taken up with the UT urban planning department, but saw no progress for nearly eight months.“But in the meeting held last month, it was made clear that the board has incorporated need-based changes and can issue these drawings itself. After the nod from the urban planning department, CHB started work to issue the drawings,” said Garg.The administration had allowed the need-based changes for CHB dwelling units last year after relaxing the Chandigarh Building Rules. The said relaxations were recommended by a committee consisting of officers of CHB, UT administration and a representative of the CHB Flats Welfare Federation. Finally, these were issued on February 15, 2019.Recent-allottee friendly initiativesThis latest initiative is part of a series of steps taken by CHB to streamline its working and improve allottee services.Recently, it implemented e-office system at all its branches to minimise movement of physical files, especially in ongoing complex issues.Apart from this, the board has started online facility for payment of all dues and also made appointments available online.The allottees can now also apply for need-based changes online. “We are working on bringing more services online, such as transfer of property and NOC. It may take around three months,” said Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/soon-pick-from-pre-designed-floor-plans-to-rebuild-your-chb-independent-house-101628799708150.html

A meeting with Shah on Wednesday evening, the SAD chief termed this as another attempt to dilute Punjab’s claim on its capital city, saying Chandigarh was an inseparable part of Punjab and should be transferred to the parent state as soon as possible. He said there was no reason to appoint a full-fledged administrator for the UT from outside the state. “If at all an administrator has to be appointed till such time the UT is not transferred to Punjab, the officer should be from the parent state. Earlier also, the chief commissioner of Chandigarh used to be from Punjab,” he said in a statement. Sukhbir informed the home minister that all decisions taken at the time of reorganisation of Punjab were being violated. He also claimed that the Centre was not following the 60:40 ratio for posting of officers in the UT. “Separate cadres have been created to reduce the strength of Punjab service officers in the UT and now even AGMUT officers are being posted on key posts in utter violation of the 60:40 formula,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-meets-shah-opposes-move-to-appoint-full-fledged-administrator-for-chandigarh-101628799527983.html

The land deal has caused a loss of ₹400 crore to the state exchequer, he claimed. The Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) leader said besides setting aside the sale, the investigation in the matter be handed over to the CBI to look into the role of state industries minister Sunder Sham Arora and department officials in the episode. A copy of the complaint was also sent to the state departments of home, police, finance and industries besides the Enforcement Directorate (ED) seeking an early action. In his complaint to the Lokpal, Bir Devinder demanded that the entire records of the sale/auction of the land be seized by the Punjab Small Industries and Exports Corporation (PSIEC) and orders e issued for registration of an FIR before handing over the matter to the CBI. Reacting to the complaint, industries minister Arora said, “We have already cancelled the deal on August 5. There is nothing to complain about now. It’s all political.” Bir Devinder, however, said that nothing had changed except cancellation of a tripartite agreement between the state government, bidders who took the land (GRG Developers) and the company assets reconstruction India limited (ARICL) who was transferred the land by the liquidator. “The industries minister is directly involved and an action be initiated against him,” he reiterated. The former deputy speaker said even as the GRG Developers had deposited ₹45 crore, half of the total deal amount, it started selling the land at ₹30,000 per square yard. “When I raised the issue for the first time in December 2020, the company stopped operations and also pulled down its website,” he said. In his complaint, the SAD (Sanyukt) leader has made the managing director and all members of the board of directors of PSIEC, corporation chief general manager SP Singh and the Punjab Infotech managing director respondents. The complaint reads: “The respondent number 7 (industries minister), who himself is a developer, took personal interest in the matter and supervised the proceedings of the meeting by staying in the department office in Chandigarh to ensure that the agenda be cleared.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/exassembly-deputy-speaker-bir-devinder-moves-punjab-lokpal-over-mohali-land-deal-101628799467895.html

In this technique, pre-sowing irrigation is applied, and primed seed is sown in a tar-wattar field preferably, using Lucky Seed Drill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pau-nabard-initiate-direct-seeded-rice-project-in-12-districts-of-state-101628799288060.html

Notwithstanding the state’s vulnerability to natural disasters, which continue to claim life and cause widespread destruction of property, the proposal still shuttles from one office to another. Every time a disaster strikes, the state government has to either look up to the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), army or paramilitary forces for help. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) had asked all states to constitute their own response force to tackle disasters after which the then Prem Kumar Dhumal-led government had mooted a proposal but the matter was put on a backburner. It was after the 2013 rains that triggered a devastating flood in Kinnaur that the state government asked the department concerned to speed up the process to set up the force. State police then drew up a plan to raise three companies of SDRF -- one each it is stationed at Pandoh in Mandi, Dharamshala, and the state capital Shimla. It proposed that police personnel in the SDRF companies will serve a minimum of five years before being replaced by younger cops. State had to bear the cost of raising SDRF. The state government also discussed the proposal with the NDMA which agreed to provide equipment but said no to train the police personnel. The NDMA said the option was unviable as cops have to perform other important duties like maintaining law and order. The state government re-examined the proposal of setting up SDRF after the heavy monsoon rains caused widespread devastation in 2018. It pushed a proposal envisaging setting up a team of 350 personnel. Government proposed to draw 50 police personnel each from the six Indian reserve battalions in the state. However, the state police turned down the scheme citing shortage of personnel after which the government proposed to form the SDRF by recruiting personnel from home guards and fire department. This year, 249 people had been killed in natural calamities in the monsoon season till August 12 while the state has suffered cumulative losses upto ₹783.crores.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-disaster-prone-hp-setting-up-of-sdrf-caught-in-red-tape-101628798328456.html

This leads to traffic congestion, especially in the evenings, as people park their cars in the middle of the road to make purchases.The dividing road between Sectors 46 and 47 has been fully occupied by these vendors, who park their transport autos and rehris on the roadside to sell fruits and vegetables. HS Maken, member of the Sector 47-C Residents’ Welfare Association (RWA), said, “This is a recurring problem on this road. Before the pandemic started, they had stopped setting up stalls here, but now, they have started again.”Maken added that the authorities routinely organise drives to remove them, but they return after a few days. President of the Sector 48 RWA, JJ Singh, said, “The vending zone in Sector 48 is overrun by weeds and abandoned. Why can’t these vendors be shifted here?” He added that Sector 48 has its own problem with vendors near Blossom Cooperative Society in Sector 48-A.In Sector 45 tool, vendors have taken over most of the roads inside the sector, as per social activist Kusum Ghai. “Stalls have been set up on both sides of the road near the Burail mandi, making it difficult for vehicles to move. The vendors hardly ever wear masks and authorities do nothing about it despite repeated complaints,” she said.Kuljinder Sra, general secretary of the Sector 33-B RWA , said he has written to the police about this, but to no avail. “Due to the lackadaisical attitude of beat cops here, an increasing number of vendors are setting up here.

But just as I turned back to return to the bus, I saw it rolling down the side of the hill. It seemed like the entire hill was crumbling.

In seven districts of the south Malwa belt, only Bathinda reported 10 complaints against medical institutes. Bathinda civil surgeon Dr TS Dhillon said of these, four complaints were under investigation, whereas six cases have been disposed of.In the rest of the six districts, no patient lodged a complaint with the authorities about overcharging by the hospitals or diagnostic laboratories.“To date, the maximum punishment in Covid-19 related cases from the region has been meted out to Global Healthcare, a city-based super-specialty private hospital, where it was barred from admitting new coronavirus cases till July-end from June 1,” Dr Dhillon added. An inspection by the health team in May found the hospital had admitted four times its authorised strength of patients with level-3 complication (critically-ill patients). “To date, there is not even a single case where a complainant furnished documentary evidence to support an allegation of charging more than rates fixed by the state government. A bunch of complaints were registered against four private laboratories in Bathinda for charging more than the state government’s price list. None of these cases, however, were referred by any doctor or tagged as Covid-19 patients or suspected cases of the infection. The administration let these off with a strict warning,” Dr Dhillon added.Departmental probes have said that in one case it was found the deceased was not a Covid-19 patient, while in two instances, the complainants were withdrawn. In another case, the claim of overruled as the hospital bill was covered under medical insurance. “The state government’s policy was framed for a patient paying from his own pocket,” the doctor added.“Some unscrupulous elements were found making frivolous charges of medical negligence and overcharging by a leading medical facility on social media. There was not a single representation against it with us,” says a health department official requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-private-hospital-in-southern-punjab-overcharged-for-covid-treatment-health-dept-101628797967921.html

However, the buildings have neither been razed nor was any action taken against the owners. Many buildings that were constructed over 100 years ago are still occupied. “The civic body has been writing to the police department to get these buildings vacated stating that the MC does not have the powers to get the buildings vacated under Municipal Corporation Act, 1976.” MC officials claim that the owners and tenants in most of buildings are at loggerheads over possession and the cases are sub-judice, due to which the MC cannot take any action. Notices have been issued to the occupants saying they must vacate the vulnerable buildings. Of the 132 buildings, 64 buildings are in Zone A, 21 in Zone B, 14 in Zone C and 33 in Zone D. The buildings are situated in the Chaura Bazar area, Daresi Road, Rarri Mohalla, Lakkar Bazar, Field Ganj, Iqbal Ganj chowk, Moti Nagar, Amarpura, Dashmesh Nagar near Gill Chowk, Jawaddi and Barewal among other areas. The building collapse on Thursday was not an isolated incident. 70-year-old Gurcharan Singh had died in 2015 died after a part of an unsafe building collapsed, while the owner of an 80-year-old unsafe building on Deepak Cinema Road, Ashok Kumar Behal, 65, had a narrow escape after a portion of the building collapsed on July 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/132-unsafe-buildings-in-ludhiana-city-many-over-100-years-old-survey-101628797907905.html

Before its expiry on March 31, 2013, the firm wrote to the PUDA chief administrator (CA) in February to extend the bank guarantee till 2016 as they had not got site clearance. But the officials concerned failed to do so, despite the directions of the CA, and the guarantee’s period expired.Following this, the then CA, Manvesh Singh Sidhu, directed the officials to fix the responsibility of the negligent staff. After an internal probe, the bank guarantee was found missing, following which an FIR of theft was registered against Raj Kumar Garg. In 2018, the case was handed over to the Vigilance Bureau. After a three-year-long probe, the bureau established that the bank guarantee was not stolen, but deliberately misplaced under a conspiracy by Garg and Singh.As such, the theft FIR lodged under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was changed to Sections 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC, and Section 13 of Prevention of Corruption Act.“We have arrested Harpreet Singh, who has been sent to two-day police remand, and will also nab Garg soon. We are looking into who was benefitted by their act of destroying the evidence and the role of the hotel firm,” said deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Ajay Kumar.Garg retired in September 2013 and is currently living in Sector 67, Mohali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohalimissing-5-crore-bank-guarantee-vigilance-books-two-puda-staffers-101628797247929.html

People started screaming and I was sure that we were all going to die.”Sunil’s wife, Malti Devi said, “My husband, our two children and I were inside our room when the building collapsed. Hearing a blast-like sound Sunil ran outside and was promptly hit on the head with a falling brick. There was dust all around and the injured were lying on the floor with bricks and irons grills crushing them.”Shiv Nath, a relative of 28-year-old Pooja and her two-year-old son Arush, who sustained serious injuries, said, “Pooja was busy with household chores and her son close by when the building collapse. We can only hope that they survive as their injuries are grave.”One Krishna, who works at the adjoining transport shed, said he saw the first few bricks fall and raised the alarm, due to which six employees, who were inside the shed came out safe. The building came crashing down seconds later.The labourers have demanded compensation from the administration saying that they could not afford to pay for the treatment of the injured. A labourer, Durga Baba, said, “The owner of labour quarters has submitted some amount with the hospital, but that will not be enough. The owner of the building that collapsed has not even visited the hospital.”MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said,” Tara Chand, the owner of the unsafe building, will pay for the treatment of the injured labourers.” The labourers have demanded compensation from the administration saying that they cannot afford to pay for the treatment of the injured.

Claiming that the police and the civic administration have failed to act on their repeated complaints, residents have cordoned off the main road that leads to a street, where drugs are bought and sold. Villagers claim that of 30-odd houses in this street, seven are in the business of drug peddling. It has been eight days since they cordoned off the thoroughfare.The issue has assumed such grave proportions here that Kamaljeet Kaur, 40, a mother of two teenaged sons, wants the police to arrest them. The sons have already sold all household items to finance their addiction and have now taken to selling wheat. “The administration and police are not doing their duty. I am requesting the police to arrest my both sons in any case. This is the only solution to stop their addiction,” she said, adding that this was the story of the majority of households.Villagers have identified 17 persons who are allegedly selling drugs; they claimed to have handed over the list to police, but no action has resulted. Gurdarshan Singh, 73, a retired sub-inspector from CRPF, said, “Over the past two years, the illegal practice of drug peddling has only gotten worse. Now, we have decided to take action on our own.”Another village resident, Resham Singh, 45, said, “Last year, I found that my son had started taking drugs and he was buying them from our neighbours. I had to shift him to Daroli Bhai village with my relatives. I am not allowing him to visit his own village. Now, we have cordoned off the road and are not allowing anyone to buy drugs.”Mandeep Kaur, 57, said, “I live on the street and drug peddlers and addicts used to cram it with their vehicles. I, along with dozens of women, went to the local police station to seek help, but nothing happened. We will end the menace on our own.”Sarpanch Charanjeet Kaur said, “We want to eradicate drug menace from the village. Over the past two years, 12 people have died around the infamous street.” Moga SSP Harmanbir Singh Gill said, “There is no such list of names of drug peddlers or houses on record with my office. I have asked SP (D) to work on villagers’ allegations.

We don’t understand why the Haryana CM is taking action against farmers,” he said.“Movements so not end by registration of FIRs and the government should understand it,” he said.Tikait slammed the Haryana government for arresting around 200 farmers in Ambala for showing black flags to state home minister Anil Vij.He said, “There are no differences between BKU leader Gurnam Singh Charuni and leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM). He is with the Morcha and we will continue our fight united.”He said the agitation is going on in the right direction and the government will have to repeal the “black laws”.“Farmers are known for their patience and we will wait for the government to resume talks,” Tikait said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-govt-cannot-suppress-farm-agitation-by-registering-firs-against-farmers-tikait-101628796527727.html
13-08-2021||Chandigarh||Decades after anti-Sikh riots, UP cops examine crime scene again||Kanpur A special investigation team (SIT) is re-examining the scene of a crime decades after two men were allegedly murdered and their bodies set on fire in their house here during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.Crucial evidence, including blood samples, has been lifted this week from a locked house in city’s Govind Nagar, attacked by a mob during the anti-Sikh riots that followed the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi.The SIT, formed by the Yogi Adityanath government on the orders of the Supreme Court, entered the locked house with a forensic team on Tuesday, superintendent of police (SIT) Balendu Bhushan said.After Delhi, Kanpur was among the worse-hit by the violence. Teja Singh (45) and his son Satpal Singh (22) were killed on November 1, 1984.The SIT has got the statement of Teja Singh’s surviving son, Charanjeet Singh -- now 61 and a resident of Delhi -- recorded before a special magistrate.The witness narrated the horrific episode and disclosed the identities of those allegedly involved in the murders. The surviving members of Teja Singh’s family had sold off the Kanpur house and moved first to Punjab and then Delhi. A Kanpur sub-inspector filed the FIR.SP Bhushan said the crime scene was undisturbed as the new occupants stayed on the first floor. The ground floor rooms where the murders took place remained locked.The SIT entered the house in the presence of an eyewitness to the attack who lived in the same area.Bhushan said the forensic science laboratory determined that the blood samples collected were of human beings, which confirmed that killings had taken place there.Earlier this year, the SIT had collected blood samples from a house in Kanpur’s Naubasta area. It too had been locked up after a similar attack.The Uttar Pradesh SIT was formed to revisit cases filed after the 1984 riots.The Kanpur SSP provided the SIT with a list of 40 cases of serious nature. Of them, the Kanpur Police had filed charge sheets in 11 cases and final reports in the remaining 29, which lacked substantial evidence.But the accused were acquitted in all 11 cases with the trial court citing lack of evidence.“We have sought permission from the state government to file an appeal against the judgment of lower courts in five cases,” Bhushan said. “We are still waiting for the government nod.” The SIT also started further investigations in the 29 cases closed by Kanpur Police and hopes to file charge-sheet in some of them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/decades-after-anti-sikh-riots-up-cops-examine-crime-scene-again-101628796467962.html

13-08-2021||Chandigarh||UPSC panel shortlists 3 IPS officers for post of new Haryana DGP||Strap: DG (vigilance) PK Agrawal seems an obvious choice for the top job The empanelment committee of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) went strictly by seniority to shortlist a panel of three senior-most Haryana IPS officers on Thursday for selection of the new director general of police (DGP).The new police chief will be picked by the state government from among these three officers.The 1988-batch officer and director general (vigilance bureau) PK Agrawal, who is the senior-most of the three seems to be the obvious choice, followed by 1989-batch officer and DG (crime) Mohammad Akil, and Haryana Police Housing Corporation managing director RC Mishra.The empanelment committee headed by UPSC member Rajiv Nayan Choubey which met in New Delhi on Thursday also approved the minutes of the meeting and the select list for conveying it to the state government.Other members of the committee include director general, CRPF, Kuldip Singh; secretary, border management, ministry of home affairs, Sanjeeva Kumar; and Haryana chief secretary Vijai Vardhan. The new DGP is likely to be appointed in a day or two.The state government had last month set in motion the process to appoint the new police chief after incumbent DGP Manoj Yadava sought premature repatriation to the Intelligence Bureau citing career consideration and family requirements.Subsequently, a proposal containing the names of eight IPS officers was sent to the UPSC for shortlisting three senior-most officers. Seven IPS officers who have put in 30 years of service and were eligible for empanelment were in the zone of consideration.They included PK Agrawal, Mohammad Akil, RC Mishra, 1990-batch officers Shatrujeet Kapoor and Desh Raj Singh, and 1991-batch officers Alok Roy and Sanjeev Kumar Jain.As per the directions of the Supreme Court, the state DGP will be selected by the state government from among the three senior-most officers of the department who have been empanelled for promotion to that rank by the UPSC on the basis of their length of service, good record and range of experience for heading the police force.“Once he has been selected for the job, he should have a minimum tenure of two years irrespective of his date of superannuation,” said the 2006 landmark Prakash Singh judgment of the apex court.The SC had in March 2019 clarified that recommendation for appointment to the post of DGP by the UPSC and preparation of panel should be purely on the basis of merit from officers who have at least six months of service prior to retirement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/upsc-panel-shortlists-3-ips-officers-for-post-of-new-haryana-dgp-101628795988151.html

Three others were also taken into custody by the police at Parao police station.The overnight police operation prompted more farmers to gather near the police station, who staged a sit-in on NH-44 just next to Vij’s residence.All of them were detained, including the union’s district president Malkit Singh, and taken to police lines.Meanwhile, many BJP workers gathered outside Parao police station demanding early arrest of the accused. Party’s Sadar Mandal chief Rajiv Gupta alleged usage of stones and weapons (swords) to attack Vij.On the other side, the situation turned tense as farmers from nearby districts gathered at the Shambhu border and unanimously decided to gherao the SP office. A huge police force was deployed on both sides of a lane leading to police lines.At around 3pm on Thursday, a local court released Navdeep, who was arrested in an old case of June 21 lodged at the city police station for protesting against a public event of education minister Kanwar Pal.His counsel and Haryana Congress treasurer Rohit Jain said, “While the police asked for a judicial custody citing law and order, the court released him on bail terming his arrest unjustified.”Inspector Devender Singh, station in-charge, Parao police station, said two FIRs were lodged on the day.“Those who showed black flags also pelted stones and a case under the Damage to Public Property Act and related charges was lodged. Farmers, who staged a dharna in the morning, were booked for blocking the national highway and related charges.”SSP Hamid Akhtar said all arrested farmers were released. As police found no involvement of three men taken into custody last night, they were let go.“Fifteen of those who were arrested were booked by name along with 50 others. They, along with Aman, were released after being presented before a court,” the IPS officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vij-shown-black-flags-after-hours-of-deadlock-70-arrested-farmers-released-in-ambala-101628795687960.html

13-08-2021||Chandigarh||Mali’s appointment as adviser to Sidhu raises brows in Cong||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s decision to appoint Malvinder Singh Mali, a strident critic of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, as his adviser has raised eyebrows in section of the ruling party. Sidhu, who took over as the new chief of the Punjab Congress last month, named Mali among his four advisers on Wednesday. His appointment has not gone down well with a section of the party, who are upset over his frequent comments on social media against the CM. On Amarinder’s meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday, Mali wrote: “Punjabis beware! Signals from the trio of Capt, Shah and Modi to create communal tension, fear and terror are alarm bells for Punjabis and farmers.” Capt (Amarinder) has handed over his agenda to the central government, he added on his Facebook wall. Congress leader Anish Sidana has questioned the new state chief’s decision to appoint Mali as his adviser. “His post is highly objectionable. We respect the PPCC chief since he is the appointee of the Congress president, but he should be more circumspect in selecting his team,” said the former member of the Kandi Area Development Board, seeking Mali’s removal. Another senior party leader said though it was the prerogative of the Punjab Congress president to choose his advisers, he should have taken committed Congressmen in his team. However, Mali, who started out as a student leader and then worked in education department for 19 years before turning to activism, said he had been expressing his opinion on various issues of Punjab and would continue to voice his views, but would keep in mind his role as the adviser to president of the Punjab Congress now. “I was with (former SGPC president Gurcharan Singh) Tohra Saab, but did not join the SAD or attend any of its meetings. When I was in government service, I worked as a PRO to close aides of two chief ministers Capt Amarinder and (Parkash Singh) Badal Saab but never attended any party meetings or spoke on party matters. This is not something new for me,” he said. Mali said those questioning my appointment had not understood it as he was not taking anyone’s position or joining the party. “The Congress has its own culture, and I will have nothing to do with the party’s internal matters. I will only give advice to Sidhu on his Punjab agenda and the roadmap for solutions to issues such as diversification and loot of public money,” he said.Mustafa declines Sidhu’s offer Former IPS officer Mohd Mustafa has declined state Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s offer to become his adviser. Mustafa’s name was among the four advisers appointed by Sidhu on Wednesday to assist him in the daily functioning of the state. The other three advisers are Fatehgarh Sahib MP Amar Singh, Malwinder Mali and retired registrar of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences Dr Pyare Lal Garg. “I have humbly said no to this offer as I don’t find myself fit for the role. There is nothing much to it. I have thanked Sidhu for considering me,” said Mustafa.According to a senior government official, Mustafa is still in the race for an important assignment in the government.Sidhu to meet MLAs from urban areaSidhu has called a meeting of party MLAs from urban areas in Chandigarh on Friday to discuss and seek feedback on their issues and problems. The meeting will be held at Punjab Congress Bhawan. Sidhu, who took over as the president of the state unit on July 23, has already held a series of meetings with legislators belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes and party leaders from different districts in the past two weeks. The meetings were organised by working presidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/malis-appointment-as-adviser-to-sidhu-raises-brows-in-cong-101628795387715.html

Saini has been directed to join the probe as and when called for and surrender his passport.The former director general of police had moved the court on Wednesday after a Mohali trial court dismissed his plea on August 6. Supreme Court lawyer Mukul Rohatgi, along with senior advocate APS Deol, appeared for Saini and Punjab had roped in former Union minister and senior advocate P Chidambaram.The bench observed that while dealing with the application for grant of bail or anticipatory bail, elaborate discussion on the merits of the case should be desisted. There should not be an impression to the parties concerned of the case having been pre-judged. Only prima facie case is to be considered, it said, adding that it would also not be appropriate at this stage to deal with the contentions raised by Saini of political vendetta and that he has been granted protection in all other FIRs. The prayer for anticipatory bail is to be considered on the facts of each case, it added.The bench further observed that at this stage, the court exercises restraint for going any further into factual aspects of transactions, which have taken place between Saini and owner of a Sector 20 house in Chandigarh Surinderjit Singh Jaspal and are being questioned by Punjab Police. It said that since petitioner is having Z-plus protection, there is no chance of his absconding. “For joining loose ends, if any, with regard to the documentary evidence or banking transactions (about the Sector 20 house deal), this court is of the opinion that custodial interrogation of the petitioner is not required,” the bench said, granting him bail and asking Punjab Police to file a status report on October 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-punjab-ex-dgp-saini-in-corruption-case-101628795207663.html
13-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Task forces oppose school restart||The Maharashtra government is reconsidering its decision to reopen schools in the state from August 17 after the state Covid-19 task force of experts and paediatric task force strongly opposed the move over fears of infection among students, who are the unvaccinated class. Till Thursday evening, it was not clear whether the government would defer the decision or implement the same by bringing a stern standard operating procedure (SOP). This has led to confusion among both schools and parents.On Thursday, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said both task forces have their own suggestions on SOP, which they have received and a decision will be taken after deliberations.“The task force wants to study the SOP prepared by us. They also had their own suggestions. We have shared the SOP with them and also received theirs today, which the additional chief secretary, school education department (Vandana Krishna) will study. In the next few days, we will again have a meeting with task force members to deliberate in detail,” Gaikwad told reporters on Thursday.On August 10, the school education department ordered the reopening of physical classes in schools in urban areas from August 17. The offline classes have been allowed for classes 8 to 12 in the urban areas and for classes 5 to 7 in rural areas of the state. For Mumbai and Thane, it had empowered civic bodies of concerned cities to take a decision, considering the existing Covid-19 situation.The order specifies a standard operating procedure (SOP) for schools, in which the school education department has asked the school managements to follow certain rules pertaining to seating arrangements and maintaining social distancing and Covid-19 protocols in the schools.A day after a government resolution (GR) was issued, allowing schools and junior colleges to reopen from August 17, the state cabinet discussed the move and it was also decided to revisit the decision. Later, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte held a meeting with officials from the health department, school education department and the members of both task forces on the matter.State health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said, “Both task forces, unanimously, opposed the move in the backdrop of the rise in cases elsewhere in the country where schools were opened. Secondly, the students are not vaccinated, leaving a high risk of them getting infected. This has necessitated revisiting the decision of reopening of schools and colleges.” Tope said that the decision over the opening of the senior colleges will be taken after reports from district-level education societies and the universities are submitted to the government in the next few days. When asked if the likely deferment of the decision of reopening of schools is the result of lack of coordination within government, Tope said, “Different departments have the right to have different opinions. The school education department, however, does not appear to have taken the opinion of the task forces into account while issuing the GR.”Physical classes in schools were shut in Maharashtra from March 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the state. Schools in rural areas were already allowed to resume physical classes for class 8 to 12 students from July 12. Nearly 5,947 schools resumed offline classes in rural areas where Covid-19 cases are on a decline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-task-forces-oppose-school-restart-101628795030333.html
13-08-2021||Lucknow||UP govt to help firms get listed on stock exchanges||The Yogi Adityanath government on Thursday initiated the process to list more companies of the state on the National Stock Exchange (NDSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). At present, eight companies from Uttar Pradesh are listed on the NSE and nine are listed on the BSE. The state has 55 lakh demat accounts and stands at the third position in the country in terms of the number of such accounts. Navneet Sehgal, additional chief secretary, MSME, held a meeting with Rakesh Kumar, senior manager of NSE, to initiate the process of listing more companies at the two stock exchanges, on Thursday. During the meeting, Sehgal apprised the NSE official about the presence of a large number of companies from various sectors in the state, including IT, electronics, manufacturers of plastic, leather, agro, food products, processing and textiles among others. “Companies established in the state in the last four years will get preference in listing on the NSE and BSE,” Sehgal said. It was decided that virtual interactive sessions will be organised between the NSE/BSE officials and industry lobby bodies like FICCI and Udyog Bharti to help industrialists list their companies on the stock exchanges. “All help will be extended to new companies to get listed on the stock exchange. This will help them expand their business and increase their capital,” said Sehgal. Apart from this, the state government will also help in listing of companies trading in ODOP (products) on the stock exchange. The state government had launched the ODOP scheme in January 2018. It has identified 75 products in as many districts that are indigenous to that area. These products have made the respective districts famous. In the long list of 75 products are the world famous carpets of Bhadohi, brassware of Moradabad, locks of Aligarh, famous black pottery of Mirzapur, crockery of Khurja, leather of Agra and Kanpur among other products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-to-help-firms-get-listed-on-stock-exchanges-101628794847784.html
13-08-2021||Mumbai||Money laundering probe: Mumbai court grants bail to aide of Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik||A special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Thursday granted bail to Kalyan-based builder Yogesh Deshmukh, who is a close associate of Shiv Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik, in the money laundering case related to the alleged National Spot Exchange (NSEL) scam. Special judge Dinesh E Kothalikar has, however, stayed the order till August 18 to allow the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to challenge it in the future before a higher court.Deshmukh’s counsel Priyanka Dubey had argued that there was no progress in ED’s investigation. She also pointed out that though last time the bail was rejected on the grounds that further investigations was required and more arrests were to be done, Yogesh Chandegela – a relative of Sarnaik – was protected from arrest by the court. Deshmukh was in custody since April 6, but the investigation had not been progressing, she said. They had also clarified that they were not challenging the attachments of plots at Titwala, which were allegedly purchased using the NSEL scam money. The special court accepted her contentions. Observing that no progress was made by ED in the investigation and that the co-accused was protected by court orders, the special court granted bail to Deshmukh on a bond of ₹3 lakh. However, on the request of special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves, the court stayed the order as ED intends to challenge it in the high court. Sarnaik’s company is been investigated as it allegedly received ₹11 crore from NSEL scam. It is alleged Aastha Group defrauded NSEL of ₹250 crore and Sarnaik’s company Vihang Group allegedly helped it to launder the money. Vihang and Aastha groups had formed a joint venture, Vihand Housing Projects, and had purchased plots in Titwala with Deshmukh’s help. ED was told that ₹22 crore was used to purchase the plots. However, the agency learnt only ₹1 crore had been used to purchase plots in Titwala while the other ₹11 crore was transferred to Sarnaik’s company and ₹10 crore to Deshmukh. Sarnaik had previously denied all the allegations against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/money-laundering-probe-mumbai-court-grants-bail-to-aide-of-sena-mla-pratap-sarnaik-101628794729305.html
13-08-2021||Other||Another disciplinary proceeding on against Dr Kafeel Khan: UP govt to HC||In a case relating to suspension of Dr Kafeel Khan, the state government has informed the Allahabad high court that another independent disciplinary proceeding is going on against Dr Khan. “This disciplinary proceeding, in respect of various incidents which occurred after he was attached to the office of the director, medical education, hasn’t been concluded as yet,” additional advocate general (AAG), Manish Goyal said. Taking these submissions of AAG on record, Justice Yashwant Varma directed the state government to bring on record, within two weeks, an affidavit regarding the other suspension order as well as other necessary facts related to the earlier order of suspension dated August 22, 2017, by which Dr Khan was suspended. The court fixed August 31, 2021, as the next date of hearing. Dr Khan was suspended from service on August 22, 2017, following the death of about 60 infants in the BRD Medical College hospital due to lack of oxygen. Later, he was attached to the office of the Director Medical Education where he was separately suspended in respect of various incidents. Earlier, on August 6, 2021, the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government had informed the Allahabad high court that the disciplinary authority’s order dated February 24, 2020, whereby further enquiry was directed against Dr Kafeel Ahmad Khan, a suspended pediatrician of BRD Medical College of Gorakhpur, has been withdrawn. In the present writ petition, through which Dr Khan has challenged the suspension order dated August 22, 2017, by which he was suspended from service, he has disclosed that initially the proceedings were drawn against nine persons. “Seven out of those who were suspended along with the petitioner have since been reinstated pending conclusion of disciplinary proceedings,” Dr Khan added. The court passed this order on August 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/another-disciplinary-proceeding-on-against-dr-kafeel-khan-up-govt-to-hc-101628794607964.html

Out of these, five positive cases belonged to members of one family that included children in the one and two-year age group. The two other positive cases were residents of the same village.After the detection of the cases, the district health department launched an intensive trace-and-test drive in the village. The sample of 100 villagers was sent for laboratory tests which confirmed Covid-19 in 10 people. The positive cases are under observation in home isolation and the health teams have distributed medicine among them, a district administration officer said.The in-charge of Dhani community health centre, Dr Prakash Chandra Chaudhary, said that the members of the surveillance committee have been directed to maintain vigil on positive cases in Balua village. To check the spread of the infection, patients have been directed to remain in home isolation. Health teams are collecting samples of close contacts of the positive people, he said. CMO, Gorakhpur, Dr Sudhakar Pandey said that an alert has been sounded in the area as the village is located on Gorakhpur-Maharajganj district border. There is large migration of people to various parts of the country from the area and so members of health teams are collecting the travel history of the positive people, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid19-cases-up-s-balua-village-on-gkp-maharajganj-border-in-focus-101628794188893.html
13-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Congress condemns Twitter’s move to block leaders’ handles||The Maharashtra Congress has condemned Twitter India’s move to block the handles of its party leaders and alleged that the social media platform was succumbing to the pressure from the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). Twitter also locked the handles of the Congress’s Maharashtra unit and state revenue minister and senior leader Balasaheb Thorat.Alleging that the handles of the Congress leaders have been blocked for supporting their leader Rahul Gandhi, Thorat said that the move was an attempt to suppress the fundamental right of freedom to expression.“My Twitter handle has been locked by @Twitterindia for supporting Rahulji Gandhi’s stand on the rape victim of Delhi. After Rahulji’s account was locked, the platform has locked the handles of other leaders including mine and that of @INCMaharashtra. We have been talking in the interest of the common people, and had never indulged in any anti national activities. Is standing firm in support of the rape victim a crime (sic),” Thorat has questioned. Twitter had recently suspended Gandhi’s handle after he tweeted photos of the family of a nine-year-old girl who was allegedly raped and murdered in Delhi. Twitter India told the Delhi high court that the handle was suspended because the tweet by Gandhi violated its policy.Party’s Maharashtra chief Nana Patole said that the action against the Congress and its leaders by the microblogging site was taken because the party had effectively used the platform against Narendra Modi government. “The Modi government has been trying to suppress every single voice raised against it in the past seven years. There is no action by Twitter against BJP leader who use it for the divisive, antisocial and hate messages. We would not bow before any such practices,” he said.Minister of state for home Satej Patil said that such action is being initiated under the pressure from BJP, which is scared. He said anyone who questions BJP’s fascism and corruption is silenced.Maharashtra BJP vice-president Madhav Bhandari said, “Twitter had taken action against BJP leaders too in the past. Under whose pressure had Twitter acted then? The suspension of Gandhi’s account has come on the heels of a hearing in the Apex court and for the violation of the code. Congress has not said anything about the pictures of the victim’s family shared by their leader, violating the norms. They are crying foul against the action, but not uttering a word about the mistake committed by Gandhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-congress-condemns-twitter-s-move-to-block-leaders-handles-101628793947995.html

According to the police, the biker – Girish Shirsat – was riding the two-wheeler in an inebriated state. He has also suffered injuries and is yet to be arrested, the police said.The victim, Manish Kakri, was a resident of Uttar Pradesh. He was staying with his relatives and had stepped out for evening walk when the accident occurred. He died during treatment at a private hospital in Vasai.The biker tried to flee, but some locals handed him over to Manickpur police. He has been booked under section 304 (a) (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Motor Vehicles Act.“We have seized the bike and are awaiting the post-mortem report,” said a police officer.According to a local, who did not wish to be identified, Suncity Road has no speed breakers or street lighting, and motorists drive vehicles rashly, leading to such mishaps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/27yearold-killed-in-vasai-after-being-run-over-by-two-wheeler-near-mumbai-101628793587835.html
13-08-2021||Delhi||Najafgarh lake in fray to be Capital’s first bird sanctuary||The national capital may get its first bird sanctuary as the forest department plans to seek sanctuary status for the Najafgarh jheel (lake) and the area around it, said officials aware of the matter. A proposal to this effect is being prepared and will be presented to the Delhi government. Forest officials and environmental experts have been batting to conserve the lake for several years now, and argue that its environs need a higher degree of protection for its rich avian ecosystem, which could be lost without it. A survey of the area and species found in the waterbody was carried out in May. “A 50-acre area around the lake has been surveyed that has the potential to be demarcated as a bird sanctuary. It is extremely crucial to protect this wetland in order to conserve both its biodiversity as well as its ecological significance. This is one of the only rich wetlands in the city that has the potential to help raise the groundwater level of west Delhi areas such as Dwarka, which are mostly parched,” said a senior official, who did not wish to be named.The lake is located in a natural depression in southwest Delhi, close to the Gurugram-Rajokri border on National Highway-48. It is fed by the Najafgarh drain, which has a sizeable catchment area in Gurugram. A portion of the lake falls in Haryana.There are a number of bird sanctuaries around Delhi, including Okhla (under the Uttar Pradesh administration), Bhindawas bird sanctuary in Jhajjar (Haryana) and Sultanpur national park, essentially a bird sanctuary on the Gurugram-Jhajjar highway. A sanctuary declared under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 is a green place reserved exclusively for wildlife — birds, mammals, reptiles, and insects. It provides protection from any encroachment or development activities surrounding the area while allowing favourable conditions for the wildlife within it.Birders say that Najafgarh, with its long stretch flowing from Haryana to Delhi, has a greater number of birds than Sultanpur or Okhla bird sanctuaries. “There is no other place in the Delhi-Haryana region except for Najafgarh where one can find such a large number of greater flamingoes. Also, it is the only place where they have been found trying to build nests. However, with an uncontrolled volume of water being released, the nests often get destroyed every monsoon. It has a large number of common cranes not found in many places in and around Delhi,” said birder Pankaj Gupta. He also said that Najafgarh along with Basai, Sultanpur and Bhindawas forms a wetland complex where there is the most bird movement. Amid these are a number of unprotected wetlands, which have a lot of birds too. “Making it a sanctuary will help strengthen this wetland complex and hence the movement of birds,” said Gupta. In a preliminary survey, the forest department with the help of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) has prepared a checklist of over 300 bird species (both migratory and resident birds) that are found in the wetland. This includes more than 15 species that are red-listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).“Once finalised, the proposal will be sent to the Delhi government for consideration. The proposal also considers the area to be developed as an eco-tourism site that may also help boost the local economy,” the official said.So far the lake is not a protected water body or wetland area either under the Delhi government or the Haryana government. In 2019, Delhi government’s wetland authority following an order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) asked the concerned departments to carry out an extended survey of the area and formulate a plan to notify the area as a wetland under the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017. The new wetland conservation rules prohibit the setting up or expansion of industries and the disposal of construction and demolition waste in a wetland.The Delhi government had set up an expert committee to create a plan for the restoration and protection of the lake. “The environment management plan has been sent and is at present with the Union environment ministry for consideration,” said a Delhi government official requesting anonymity. Haryana is yet to submit its plan for the same, the official added.However, officials and experts believe that mere notification of the area as a wetland won’t do: it needs a sanctuary status for more stringent protection rules. Sohail Madan, an ecologist and centre manager of the BNHS’s Conservation Education Centre at the Asola wildlife sanctuary, said that Najafgarh jheel is a very important wetland for Delhi and its surrounding areas. Of all the migratory birds coming to Delhi, a huge percentage comes to this area. “It is an important habitat for predatory birds such as marsh harriers, Indian spotted eagle and peregrine falcons, among others. Apart from biodiversity, it’s an ecologically important site for groundwater recharge and hydrology of Delhi. But due to so many concerns and stakeholders, the project never takes off. I hope that in this instance, it’s successful,” said Madan.Citing an example of a lost wetland, he said the Basai wetland in neighbouring Gurugram was lost to the construction of a highway and housing colonies. Manu Bhatnagar, principal director, natural heritage division of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, said that if any area is declared as a sanctuary, it automatically comes under the purview of the Wildlife Protection Act, which has far stringent rules against encroachment or construction than those applied to a notified wetland.“The Najafgarh lake certainly requires this degree of protection. Once it’s declared a sanctuary it would imply that the environmental impact assessment requirements of new development interventions here and in the vicinity will change. It would also mean the place will have layers of protection in terms of a buffer zone, a core region (where visitors are not allowed) as well as prescribed limits for sound and the use of lights,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/najafgarh-lake-in-fray-to-be-capital-s-first-bird-sanctuary-101628793467739.html
13-08-2021||Other||UP’s Majhiari village cut off by flood waters, people seek safety elsewhere||Surrounded by water on all sides, many residents of the trans-Yamuna area’s Majhiari village have been forced to seek higher ground for safety. Many others stay on in the village, where they are forced to move about by boat.Floods have played havoc in the rural trans-Yamuna areas and around a dozen villages of Ghoorpur, Bara, Shankargarh, Lalapur etc have been hit. Relief from the administration has been inadequate as residents suffer not only due to the floods but also heavy rains. Meanwhile, officials claim that floods have mainly damaged crops and there is no threat to people and livestock.As the Yamuna’s water level rose, so did the level in its tributaries, Jhagra and Baria. Moreover, rain water from Madhya Pradesh reached these rivers causing flooding of Majhiari and other villages. The village now resembles an island as there is no way to reach or leave the village except by boat.The administration deployed boats for carrying food packets and ferrying villagers.Tribhuwan Kumar, a resident of Majhiari, said that he left the village in a boat while carrying necessary household goods. Many families have taken shelter at safer places where they are dependent on the assistance provided by the administration.Another resident, Sanjay, said that many families are still reluctant to leave the village as they have cattle. They fear that animals may starve or may die due to the floods if they leave them on their own.With the floods and rain playing havoc, the power supply to Majhiari has also been disrupted causing anger among villagers. They said that they are now using kerosene lamps for lighting. There is also a danger of wild animals and snakes entering the village due to floods, which again, is cause for fear among villagers. With a population of 1,600, most of them are still in the village.Other neighbouring villages Pure Kinnar, Ghori, Gujhwar, Jagdishpur, Naganpur, Mahera, Manpur, Naudhiya, Kanjasa, Mohni Ka Pura, Birwal and Semri villages are also flooded. State general secretary of Nishad Party Sanjeet Nishad said he carried out a survey of the villages on the banks of the Yamuna on boat on Thursday and found that people are suffering immense difficulties. Around a dozen villages are badly affected by the floods, and relief provided by the administration is inadequate.Bara SDM Saumya Gururani said that residents of Majhiari and Kanjasa village are affected by floods and are being taken to relief camps. Some families at Bhita village are also affected by the flood but are being provided help by the district administration. “Floods have affected the crops in other villages but there is no threat to life. Nine flood outposts have been established in the region where medical assistance is available round the clock,” the SDM added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ups-majhiari-village-cut-off-by-flood-waters-people-seek-safety-elsewhere-101628793408825.html

The meeting is seen as an attempt to consolidate the Opposition’s unity against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government. Gandhi has reportedly invited CMs of other non-BJP ruled states, including West Bengal’s Mamata Banerjee, Tamil Nadu’s MK Stalin and Jharkhand’s Hemant Soren. Besides them, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar could also be participating in the virtual meeting.Raut said that the Opposition is united and will continue building its strength. “Unity among the Opposition [parties] is strong. All parties met at Kapil ji’s [Congress leader Kapil Sibal] home recently. Sonia Gandhi ji has convened a meeting of all prominent Opposition leaders, including chief ministers. Maharashtra CM, too, will participate in it,” Raut said.Senior Congress leader and Maharashtra minister Balasaheb Thorat said that the aim is to keep “democracy alive”. “This monsoon session, we saw in that all the Opposition parties had come together to strengthen the democracy. This is an attempt to fight BJP, which is attacking the democracy. Sonia ji has convened a meeting and we will collectively participate in it and the democracy will remain alive in this country.”During the recently-concluded monsoon session of the Parliament, around 15 Opposition parties together took on the government on various issues, including the alleged Pegasus snooping issue, rising fuel prices and farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws.

13-08-2021||Mumbai||Reservations over inclusion of Marathas in OBC quota||After the Parliament passed the 127th Constitutional Amendment, the demand for the inclusion of the Marathas in the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) category may gather momentum. However, OBC outfits are apprehensive about it and have conveyed their apprehension to the government.The Supreme Court had quashed the Maratha reservation on three grounds. It had crossed the 50%- limit meant for reservations and the report of the Maharashtra State Commission for Backward Classes (MSCBC), led by retired judge MG Gaikwad, did not substantiate the backwardness of the community. The Apex court also considered that the 102nd Constitutional Amendment had done away with the states’ power to give reservation on backwardness. With the 127th Amendment, the Centre has given this power back to the states, but the other two hurdles in the way of reservation to Marathas remain.In such a scenario, some Maratha community leaders are demanding that the community should be given the reservation on the basis of the backwardness in the existing OBC quota of 27%. “That is the only option left with and we have been pushing for it. When a few castes were given dedicated reservations without having substantiated their backwardness or conducting survey, why should we not be incorporated in the quota? Our backwardness has been established by the Gaikwad commission,” said Virendra Pawar, one of the leaders of Maratha Kranti Morcha.Pawar said that the state government does not have the will to incorporate the community in the OBC quota and hence, it had passed a resolution in the state legislature, clarifying that until the ceiling on the reservation was not removed by the Centre, the state cannot do anything.Balasaheb Sarate, one of the Maratha leaders, said that inclusion of the Maratha community in OBC category was the only constitutional and legal option. “We had been pressing for it even during the [Devendra] Fadnavis government and had asked for dedicated reservation within the OBC category. But neither the Fadnavis government agreed, nor will any other government agree to it. After the 127th Constitutional Amendment by the Parliament, the state has the right to accord reservation. But I doubt that even if the MSCBC generates empirical data to prove backwardness, it would not stand the legal scrutiny,” he said.Prakash Shendge, former legislator and president of OBC Jan Morcha, an umbrella body of the community’s organisations, said that their apprehension was raised during the meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray earlier this week. “A section of the Maratha community has been demanding for their inclusion in OBC quota. Though it is now difficult to prove the backwardness of the community, we fear that using political might, the community can do anything. The Gaikwad commission, which endorsed the backwardness of the community, consisted of a majority of the Marathas as members. The survey conducted on behalf of commission was by the agencies led by Maratha leaders. We have clarified to the government such attempts will not be tolerated. We have also demanded with the CM for the verification of the certificates of the government employees who have been recruited as OBCs,” he said.Shedge said that the CM has assured them that the OBC quota will not be touched.In Maharashtra, 346 castes get 19% OBC reservation, while another 8% reservation has been notified for 30-plus castes under three sub-categories of OBCs.Chandrakant Bavkar of Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti, an OBC outfit, said that the community will oppose inclusion of the Marathas under reservation for OBCs. “Thanks to the uprising within the Maratha community for their reservation, even OBC community have become aware about their rights. We would not tolerate any move to include the Maratha community in OBC category. There had been attempts in the past to prove that Kunbis, which are a part of the OBC category, are Marathas, but we successfully rubbished the claim. The OBCs, that form 52% of the population, gets 27% reservation, which is insufficient for us,” he said.Bavkar said that the three successive backward classes’ commissions – Khatri, Bapat and Saraf – had turned down the claim of backwardness of the Maratha community. “Even the Apex court in its verdict on May 5 questioned the validity of the Gaikwad Commission. Five out of the 11 members of the Gaikwad Commission dissented on the Maratha reservation recommendation. I don’t think it’s that easy for the government to include the community in OBC quota,” he said.Food and civil supplies minister and Nationalist Congress Party’s OBC leader Chhagan Bhujbal said, “No such demand for the inclusion of the Marathas in OBC quota came up. Not only are the three ruling parties, but even the opposition BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) is against any such inclusion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/reservations-over-inclusion-of-marathas-in-obc-quota-101628793048896.html
13-08-2021||Delhi||CM Kejriwal: Health info management system to be launched next year||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday his government’s ambitious project to create a cloud-based health information management system (HIMS) for Delhi residents is likely to be rolled out early next year.Kejriwal on Thursday chaired a review meeting on the progress of the project, which was also attended by health minister Satyendar Jain.After the meeting, his office issued a statement, “The world-class health information management system (HIMS) is all set to be implemented by the beginning of next year. The department has completed the vendor selection and bidding process and is working on war footing to streamline the project and place it in front of the cabinet. As part of the project, health cards will be assigned to each citizen, which will be a repository of medical information. Doctors will be able to see patient’s medical history using the card and the patients will be able to make appointments from home.”The HIMS project envisages digital health cards for each patient — essentially be a QR code-based system — that will keep a record of details such as health checkups, follow-ups, surgeries, medications and vaccinations. The system is also supposed to include a mobile phone app as well as a 24X7 call centre to help patients with health-related information, fix consultations and offer other assistance, senior government officials said.The project was earlier slated to be launched this month but was delayed on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, especially the deadly second wave that Delhi saw in April, which left the health-care infrastructure overwhelmed, officials said.“The chief minister intricately reviewed the progress of HIMS along with the health helpline and the e-health card which are two crucial landmarks that the project aims to achieve. The health department officers presented a detailed project report to the chief minister... The project will be placed before the cabinet soon,” said the statement.The officials also told Kejriwal and Jain that the first phase of the project will be completed by the end of the year and the implementation can happen by the beginning of next year. A lot of progress has been made in the helpline project and the vendor will be selected soon. Call centres will be set up in the next three months to address grievances, the release said.In its first phase, the project is likely to cover all Delhi government hospitals and dispensaries. Central government hospitals and private hospitals are likely to be included in subsequent phases, said senior government officials.“The government is making sure that people don’t have to make the rounds of hospitals to get their e-health cards made. The cards will be distributed through a door-to-door campaign and will contain the entire medical history of the cardholder. They will be able to get treated at any hospital on the HIMS. After its implementation, Delhi will become the only state in the country to have a cloud-based health management system. At present, such a system is available in some developed countries like Sweden, Uganda and Germany,” Kejriwal said.300 ICU beds ready at NIRANKARI GROUNDJain said on Thursday that a Covid-19 care centre with 800 oxygen beds and 300 ICU beds is ready at the Nirankari ground in north Delhi’s Burari The centre, which also has tele-counselling facility, is part of the government’s larger plan to manage potential waves of the pandemic in the future.Jain said in a statement, “This 800-bed Covid Care Centre is being upgraded with more than 300 ICUs (beds), ventilators and a telemedicine centre and will be one of the best and most unique field hospitals in the world.”“The Covid-19 Care Centre that has seen one of the highest recovery rates across the state will be provided knowledge support by 750 physicians of the British Association for Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO),” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cm-kejriwal-health-info-management-system-to-be-launched-next-year-101628792807547.html
13-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Facades lining Chandni Chowk set for extensive revamp||New Delhi: The Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC) is expected to soon start work on restoring the façade of buildings lining the 1.3km Chandni Chowk stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid that has been revamped and made a no-go zone for motorised vehicles. Starting from the ES Pearey Lal Building to the State Bank of India building, and the iconic Chunnamal Haveli near Town Hall, besides Sis Ganj Gurdwara and Shahi Sunehri Masjid, the stretch is dotted with buildings demonstrating architectural influences from different time periods, underlining the fact that the Mughal-era market embodies both built heritage and a vibrant culture. Some of the building go back several centuries. Many of these buildings are dilapidated, and in dire need of repairs. Nitin Panigrahi, deputy general manager, Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), the nodal agency for Chandni Chowk redevelopment, said the appointment of a consultant for façade restoration was underway. However, heritage experts and local residents have cautioned against a cosmetic approach to the process. A shopkeeper at Pearey Lal building, who asked not to be named, said cosmetic beautification alone will be like covering up the mess in the market. Established in the early 20th century, the building is currently occupied by hundreds of shops and has not been repaired in years. “Beautification alone is not development. The government is trying to replicate what was done in Connaught Place. However, CP consists of a uniform pattern building with shops of similar sizes. You can’t implement a “uniform approach” in Chandni Chowk where every building and shop is different from each other,” said the shopkeeper. “Since the past many years, we have heard how all signage will be similar or how shops will have similar signboards. Different signboards add to the character of a market and here they want to kill all innovation,” he said. Heritage body INTACH offered help with facade improvement in 2019, and said that it was crucial to preserve individual characters of buildings. A uniform one-size-fits-all approach was unlikely to work for Chandni Chowk, experts said. Annabel Lopez, a consultant with INTACH, said the any attempt at restoration will need to preserve the ethos of the market. “Why should an old building change its unique front that they have been using for the last hundred years? There is no reason why all the boards or hoardings should be at a specific location and of same height. In popular memory, people associate and identify places due to their unique characteristics. These elements should be preserved,” said Lopez. Citing the facelift of the walled city in Amritsar, she said such an approach will not work in Chandni Chowk. Lopez said as part of the façade treatment in Amritsar, the whole street was given a standard treatment due to which the individual character of buildings was lost. “In Shahjahanabad, every building is unique. One building might be a late Mughal period structure, the next might be an early colonial one, and another building might have a mix of both styles. So, there is a unique character to each of the facade in Shahjahanabad and that should be retained,” she said. Local residents welcomed facade improvement but insisted on the need to curb unauthorised construction and encroachments in the area. Pointing to a recent development in which a building was given a massive façade on the lines of Jaipur’s Hawa Mahal, residents said it was important to keep a check on construction that was undertaken without necessary permissions, and does not align with the proposed restoration plans. “Local residents have to go from pillar to post for basic repairs. No construction can be undertaken here without permission, on paper, but we see examples where people are making massive buildings. It’s crucial to ensure that unauthorised construction is stopped, if the agencies are sincere about façade restoration,” said a resident, asking to remain anonymous. Conservationist and executive director of World Monuments Fund, India, Amita Baig said it was crucial for design guidelines to be framed for a façade improvement exercise. “Someone made a façade that looks like Hawa Mahal recently. How do you stop instances like these in the absence of design guidelines? And if you have design guidelines, who will be paying for them? These questions need answers,” said Baig.Both traders and residents also stressed the need for agencies to incorporate suggestions from stakeholders before finalising plans. Anil Pershad (77), one of the owners of Chandni Chowk’s iconic Chunnamal Haveli, said that he was not aware if the haveli would be taken up for façade restoration. “We don’t have any idea if our building will be included among those that will be taken up for façade restoration. I presume that they will undertake a drive similar to the one that was taken up at CP. Chandni Chowk, however, is a different place. Every building has its own unique façade and we are not sure if the agencies will be roping in conservation experts before undertaking such a drive,” said Pershad. Structures such as the haveli and many other buildings that have become weak over the years can only be restored with intervention from conservation experts. “The balcony of our haveli is made of wood. Any work would depend on the availability of raw materials and craftsmen who can deal with the process. Only conservationists can take such calls as per the needs,” said Pershad. Ashok Mathur, 52, another resident, said redevelopment in a true sense will require that issues faced by residents are addressed first. Mathur said while the façade restoration was being discussed, there was no clarity on how it will be undertaken and what buildings will be shortlisted. “The SRDC might selectively take up some buildings which are owned by banks and other institutions. There is congestion in arterial lanes and other local issues. Since such crucial aspects are not being addressed, I am not hopeful about the façade restoration plans either,” said Mathur.A senior PWD official, however, said that all buildings along the corridor will be given a facelift so that a uniform look is achieved. “The appointment of a consultant will be done this month. Once a uniform facade is achieved, MCD or SRDC might impose conditions on owners to ensure that the facade is maintained,” said the official, adding that any future facade work by individuals may require permission.Manoj Aggarwal, who runs a saree shop near Sarafa Bazaar, said while façade improvement sounds promising, it was crucial that feedback was sought from people in the area. Aggarwal recalled that some years ago, shop keepers in the area were asked to remove hoardings so that newer ones could replace them, but the exercise ended abruptly. “They removed our boards and said that we will get new ones. While some got new ones, others didn’t and the entire exercise just died down. The government should at least seek feedback from us before undertaking any exercise,” said Aggarwal. Amit Jain, another resident, whose family owns a nearly 60-year-old building at Bhai Mati Das Chowk said he was looking forward to the façade restoration of his building. Jain said since buildings have deteriorated over time, restoration has become necessary. “If the government wants to undertake repairs, why should we have any issue? We welcome the move. The government can give special attention to heritage buildings on the stretch. However, they should also ensure that residents are not inconvenienced,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-facades-lining-chandni-chowk-set-for-extensive-revamp-101628792207814.html
13-08-2021||Delhi||Two killed after shoot-out with police in north-east Delhi’s Khajuri Khas||Two alleged criminals were killed in a shoot-out between them and a police team inside a residential building in north-east Delhi’s Khajuri Khas area on Wednesday midnight, police said on Thursday.Two police constables also suffered bullet injuries in the exchange of fire, and were being treated at the Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital, the police said. Two automatic pistols, four magazines, 50 bullets, and nearly ₹1.5 lakh cash were recovered from the room where the two criminals lived on rent. Police have identified them as Aamir Khan, a resident of Loni, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajman, from Wazirabad in north-west Delhi.An investigator, who asked not to be named, said Khan was named in seven criminal cases and Rajman had five cases against him. Most of these cases were related to robbery and murder. A second investigator, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said a team from Begumpur police station went to the building in Khajuri Khas on Wednesday tracking a stolen bike. “As part of the checks before Independence Day, the team went there to verify a stolen motorcycle, and landed at the flat where the two men were hiding. When the police team identified themselves while knocking the doors of the flat, and asked the residents to come out, the two men refused and threatened to kill everyone,” he said. The Begampur police personnel then informed the local police. Deputy commissioner of police (north-east) SK Sain said the station house officer of Khajuri Khas police station received information from his Begumpur counterpart on Wednesday night about the presence of “wanted criminals with heavy arms and ammunition” in Shri Ram Colony area.” A joint team was formed and the cops left for the spot.When the police team asked them to surrender, they refused and threatened that they will kill themselves and blow up the building. “They warned the police to leave and threatened to blow up the building. They said they would kill themselves and everyone else,” the DCP said, adding that the police tried to pacify them but they did not calm down and kept shouting threats from inside. The police team then asked families living in other flats of the four-storey building to vacate their houses. One officer, who was part of the operation, said, “One of them said they had explosives. Another was continuously threatening to kill himself. We even called the landlord of the house and promised to them that they would not be hurt. We have a photograph of one of them holding a pistol to his head. They said they have weapons and ammunition to last hours, but we kept trying to talk to them and asking them surrender.” Around midnight, two hours after reaching the spot, the police decided to break into the room. When the inmates realised that the police were coming inside, they allegedly opened fire. “The accused fired indiscriminately. They fired at our policemen from the windows and the door. The police team retaliated in self-defence. During cross firing, constables Sachin Khokar and Kalik Tomar suffered bullet injuries. Other members of the team pulled them back. The two criminals were also hit. Both of them and the injured police personnel were immediately shifted to Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital, Khan and Rajman were declared brought dead,” DCP Sain said. Investigation has shown that the two men took the room on rent from a Sonia Vihar resident about two weeks ago. The house owner told police that the had asked them to provide their identification papers for police verification, but they were dilly-dallying. On Thursday afternoon, there was heavy security in the area even as several locals were seen standing outside the building. Most of them said they were shocked and could not believe how these two men, who looked like school teachers, were actually fugitives with a history of heinous criminal cases. “They looked like teachers and carried bag packs. They also wore black goggles. Nobody knew about their criminal record. We have always seen them on a bike, with their masks on,” said Virender, a local resident adding that on Wednesday night, the residents first saw police personnel outside the building around 10.30pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-killed-after-shoot-out-with-police-in-north-east-delhi-s-khajuri-khas-101628791319093.html

13-08-2021||Delhi||Spate of transfers in Delhi’s Tihar jail, a week after inmate’s suspected murder||Following the suspected murder of a prisoner — he was found dead in his cell — in Tihar jail last week, the jail administration on Thursday issued transfer orders to several jail superintendents, in the wake of a high-ranking jail official being named as a suspect in the murder case.Ankit Gujjar, an alleged top gangster, was found dead in his cell in jail number 3 last Wednesday. Police registered a case of murder against a deputy jail superintendent and are probing the role of his junior officers as well.Prisons director general Sandeep Goel confirmed the spate of transfers and said,” The superintendent of jail 3 has been transferred to the headquarters. The officer who was at the headquarters has been transferred to Rohini. The Rohini superintendent has been transferred to jail 5, while the officer who headed jail 5 is now in charge of jail 3.”After Gujjar’s death, four officers of jail 3, including the deputy superintendent, were transferred pending investigation.In their statement to police, the jail officers of jail 3 said that during a search of Gujjar’s cell on August 3, they seized a cellphone, data cable and a knife. While they were carrying out the search, Gujjar assaulted the deputy superintendent after which the jail officers beat him with “minimum force”. Gujjar was then transferred to another cell and was found unconscious the following morning during roll call. He was rushed to the jail hospital where he was declared brought dead, they told the police.Police registered a case of murder under the Indian Penal Code and named the deputy superintendent as an accused, among others, but are yet to arrest anyone.Until his arrest in August 2020, Gujjar, 29, was one of western Uttar Pradesh’s most wanted criminals, police said. Accused in at least eight murder cases, among others, Gujjar carried a reward of ₹1.25 lakh at the time of his arrest --- ₹1 lakh was announced by the Uttar Pradesh Police and ₹25,000 by Delhi Police.Gujjar, a resident of Baghpat , was arrested by UP Police in 2015 but he came out on bail in 2019. He then shifted his operations to Delhi and joined hands with Delhi gangster Rohit Chaudhary to form the “Chaudhary-Gujjar gang”. In July 2019, Gujjar shot dead a local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Vinod Pandit as he was contesting the panchayat elections from Chandi Nagar in Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh.This is not the first instance of an inmate being killed in Tihar. Only last month, the Delhi high court had asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe an inmate’s murder that took place in May. Delhi Police arrested four Tihar inmates for that murder, but the family of the dead prisoner, Srikant Swami, accused jail officers of being responsible for his murder, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/spate-of-transfers-in-delhi-s-tihar-jail-a-week-after-inmate-s-suspected-murder-101628791067667.html
13-08-2021||Delhi||Will resend oxygen panel proposal to Lieutenant Governor, says Sisodia||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday said the Delhi government was resending a proposal to lieutenant governor (LG) Anil Baijal to set up an audit committee to ascertain the number of deaths caused by the oxygen shortage in the city during the second national wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.He also wrote to Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya urging him to request the LG to allow constituting the panel so such deaths can be probed.Addressing a digital press briefing, the deputy chief minister on Thursday stressed on the need for the panel, saying it will be difficult to determine if there were oxygen-related deaths in April-May without a proper inquiry.On May 27, the state government set up a six-member panel to look into deaths caused due to oxygen shortages at the peak of the second wave of Covid-19 (fourth for Delhi).The panel was also asked to ascertain the criteria for compensation of ₹50,000 to ₹5 lakh to be given to families of the deceased. The committee comprised five doctors from Delhi government hospitals, and one member from the director general of health services’ office.“But through the LG, the Centre did not allow that committee to be formed. We are sending the file again to the Delhi LG for approval. We will carry out the probe with full responsibility and even punish those who were guilty,” Sisodia said.The LG’s office did not respond to request for comment on the matter.On June 16, Sisodia said in a press briefing that the Centre dismissed the Delhi government’s panel saying a similar committee was constituted weeks before that on the directions of the Supreme Court.On Thursday, Sisodia said the national capital has recorded a total of over 25,000 deaths due to Covid-19, and emphasised that it needs to be probed how many of these were linked to the oxygen crisis in April and May.“We cannot say there was no oxygen crisis. The families of patients, hospitals were sending out SOS messages for help at that time,” he said on Thursday.The issue of the panel has become a new flashpoint with the Delhi government and the Centre in recent weeks.On Wednesday, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said his ministry, on July 26, wrote to the Delhi government seeking details on deaths caused by oxygen shortage in Delhi during the latest wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.Mandaviya’s comment was in response to Sisodia’s comments on Tuesday, when the deputy chief minister said that the central government did not write any letter to the Delhi government seeking details of the deaths caused by oxygen shortage.On Wednesday, Sisodia reacted to Mandaviya’s comment, saying the Centre gave states barely 12-13 hours to respond to their letter, and that they were not informed that the responses could have been sent till August 13.At the peak of the fourth wave of infections, Delhi recorded around 28,300 cases in a day and a positivity rate exceeding 36%.Around that time, at least 31 people are believed to have died because of oxygen shortage in separate incidents in two separate facilities — between April 23 and 24 at Jaipur Golden hospital and on May 1 at Batra hospital.On May 4, the state government told the Delhi high court that an expert committee could not ascertain whether 21 deaths at Jaipur Golden hospital had happened because of oxygen shortage.On July 20, when the Centre told Parliament that states have so far recorded no deaths caused by oxygen shortage, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi criticised the Union government saying that they did not let the city government probe such matters by setting up a larger expert committee.When asked about its previous statements in the court, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said that those were based on “preliminary” findings and the matter needed more investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/will-resend-oxygen-panel-proposal-to-lieutenant-governor-says-delhi-s-deputy-cm-sisodia-101628790947635.html
13-08-2021||Gurugram||One held for trying to sell brass as Mughal-era gold||The Faridabad police arrested a Palwal resident for allegedly conning people from other states on the pretext of selling them gold bricks from the Mughal era that were excavated in Jimrawat village of Palwal.The police said that the suspect, identified as Ishak, of Jimrawat, is a member of the Tatlu gang and he had conned over 30 people over the past two years by selling them brass bricks.The police zeroed in on Ishak following a complaint from a Delhi resident who said that he was getting frequent calls about a 200-year-old gold brick. The complainant, identified as Anuj Kumar, a resident of Badarpur in Delhi, who works in Ballabgarh, approached the police suspecting it to be a fraud.OP Singh, the Faridabad commissioner of police, said that Kumar decided to meet the suspect and alerted the police in advance. “He asked the suspect to meet him at the Ballabhgarh Metro station and assured him of purchasing the gold brick, telling him that his mother was keen on getting ornaments made,” he said. Singh said that Kumar met the suspect at the gate, where police were already deployed in plainclothes. “The suspect started narrating a story, telling Kumar that his brother is a JCB machine driver in a remote area of Palwal and had found the brick while digging. He said that his brother hid it in his pocket and they were selling it as they were facing a financial crisis,” he said. However, when Kumar refused and alleged he was trying to con him, the suspect fled. The police caught hold of him and recovered a gold-coloured brick that was found to be made of brass.A case under sections 34 (common intention), 420 (cheating) and 511 (committing offences punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonment) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at Ballabhgarh police station. The police said that the suspect cheated people from Bihar, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, and Odisha, and revealed the names of three associates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/one-held-for-trying-to-sell-brass-as-mughal-era-gold-101628789567703.html
13-08-2021||Ranchi||Dhanbad judge death case: CBI submits first status report in HC||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday submitted its first investigation status report to the Jharkhand High Court in connection with the death of a Dhanbad judge in a “road accident” in the coal city last month.Both the Supreme Court and the HC had taken suo motu cognisance of the incident and the apex court had directed the CBI to file status report every week with the high court.The investigation officer in the case also appeared before the division bench of chief justice Dr Ravi Ranjan and justice Sujit Narayan Prasad that directed the agency to conduct probe in a professional manner and file a detailed report next week.During the hearing, the court also sought details from the state government about security measures at Dhanbad court and the judges.“I can’t comment on the content of the status report. We submitted the first status report today as per the Supreme Court direction. The next progress report in sealed cover would be submitted for the next hearing on August 20,” said CBI counsel Rajiv Sinha.A news agency, however, quoted Jharkhand’s advocate general Rajiv Ranjan as saying that the HC was not satisfied with the status report.People involved in the proceedings said the bench sought to know from the investigation officer about forensic report of the crime scene and the auto rickshaw that mowed down additional district judge Uttam Anand, besides questioning of people seen in the CCTV footage that emerged after the accident.The CBI informed the court it had taken custody of the auto rickshaw involved in the accident to recreate the crime scene and that the forensic report of the samples lifted for test was still awaited. It also said they had questioned one of two bike riders on CCTV passing on the same road at the time of the accident.Anand was brought dead to the hospital on July 28, about an hour after he was hit by the three-wheeler from behind near Randhir Verma square in Dhanbad when he was out for a morning walk.Footage from a CCTV installed near the accident site however raised suspicion about the motive of incident as the involved three-wheeler is seen swerving towards extreme left from the middle of the road and hitting the judge from behind before fleeing the spot.The CBI took over the investigation from the state police after the Jharkhand government recommended to the Centre to hand over investigation to the central agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dhanbad-judge-death-case-cbi-submits-first-status-report-in-hc-101628785787449.html
13-08-2021||Lucknow||Previous govt didn’t try to create jobs in Uttar Pradesh, says Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday said the previous government was only engaged in the politics of caste and made no attempt to prevent brain drain by generating employment in the state.“But in the last four years ever since the BJP came to power in 2017, the image of the state changed completely with large-scale appointment of teachers against vacant post,” he said.The chief minister was distributing appointment letters to 2,846 newly selected lecturers and assistant teachers of government secondary schools at an event held at Lok Bhavan in Lucknow under Mission Rozgar. He said his government had given jobs to over 4.5 lakh (450,000) youths in Uttar Pradesh and by the end of the government’s present term, the number will cross five lakh. The Uttar Pradesh assembly election is due early next year.In the last 15 to 20 years, no other government in the state could boast of giving jobs to such a large number of youths, he said.Reiterating the “fair and transparent” recruitment process in Uttar Pradesh, the chief minister said, “Before 2017, every selection process used to face allegations of corruption. Desperate and hopeless, they youths were forced to migrate. The system of recruitment was mired in dishonesty and nepotism.”“Our government has controlled the entire process and made it transparent. The effects are visible. I am happy that by following the eligibility and reservation rules, the most qualified candidates were selected as teachers by the secondary education department. About 1.5 lakh (150,000) teachers have been appointed in the departments of basic, secondary, higher and technical education,” he said.Lauding the New Education Policy 2020, Yogi said it would encourage innovation and research.“From 2022, the country will move forward with the new education policy,” he said.Stressing the need for all-round development of students in Uttar Pradesh, he said with the implementation of NEP: “Education should not be just bookish knowledge, but new innovation will be brought in. This has been taken care of in the new education policy and you all have to prepare for the same.”“If teachers perform their duties, the students will always remember them. If they are careless, the same students will curse them throughout their life. If a teacher works as a student with the curiosity to learn continuously, he will be known as a qualified teacher throughout his life,” he said.Call to restore golden days of govt schoolsChief minister Yogi Adityanath has called upon the teachers to restore the golden days of government and aided secondary schools.Noting that the challenge before these educational institutions was to save their identity, he said teachers would have to come forward to change their image.Asking the selected lecturers to discharge their responsibility with sincerity, he said there was a need to build confidence in the new generation and the teachers should take a personal interest in every student.He also asked the teachers to inform students about government welfare schemes in the education sector.“Often, the students complain that they did not get the scholarships. It is the responsibility of teachers to inform the students regarding the same,” he stated.Describing teachers as the building blocks of the society and the nation, he said they must realise their great responsibility and prepare a generation that will be able to lead the nation in the future.Speaking at the event, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said that under the direction of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Uttar Pradesh was the first state to implement the education policy of India. The education system in the state was totally fair and transparent, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/previous-govt-didn-t-try-to-create-jobs-in-up-says-yogi-adityanath-101628783987296.html
13-08-2021||World||Denmark, Norway to shut down embassies in Afghanistan amid Taliban terror||Amid the current turmoil in Afghanistan, Denmark and Norway announced on Friday that they are shutting down their embassies in Kabul for now, and also evacuating their staff. The Islamist extremist group Taliban have reportedly captured more than ten provincial capitals till now, and are strengthening their march towards the capital city, Kabul.Speaking to journalists, Danish foreign minister Jeppe Kofod said, “We have decided to temporarily close our embassy in Kabul.”Later, Norway’s foreign minister Ine Soreide confirmed that the country would also shut down its embassy and evacuate Norwegian diplomats, local employees and their close relatives.Kofod told media persons that the evacuation will be done “closely coordinated” with Norway, with which the country shares a compound.Meanwhile, France’s foreign ministry has once again asked French citizens to leave Afghanistan as soon as possible. “In light of the deteriorating security situation, we again called on French citizens last week to leave the country as soon as possible,” a statement said.Also Read | India preps for rapid evacuation of nationals in Afghanistan amid Taliban blitzThe recent developments come after the US President Joe Biden declared on April 14 that the country will withdraw its troops from Afghanistan after two decades starting May 1. Until now, an estimated 65 per cent of the Afghan territory, with many nearby towns of Kabul, have fallen into the Taliban forces. As many as 15 provincial capitals of Afghanistan has been captured by Taliban.Although peace talks had occurred in Qatar between the negotiators representing the Afghan government led by President Ashraf Ghani and the Taliban fighters for a power-sharing dead, the same has reportedly hit dead end as the latter has continued with its atrocities against security forces.On Thursday, the US embassy in Kabul said that they’ve heard of reports about Taliban executing surrendering Afghan troops. “The Taliban’s statements in Doha do not resemble their actions in Badakhshan, Ghazni, Helmand & Kandahar. Attempts to monopolise power through violence, fear, and war will only lead to international isolation,” tweeted Ross Wilson, Chargé d'Affaires to Afghanistan.Also Read | Taliban ban Covid jab in Paktia, claims report; Video shows them partying after fall of JowzjanThe US pointed out that such acts could define “war crimes” and also urged the extremist group not to wipe out Afghanistan’s “human rights gains” of the last two decades.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denmark-norway-to-shut-down-embassies-in-afghanistan-amid-taliban-terror-101628877209716.html
13-08-2021||World||Israel to open Gaza crossing for first time since Covid-19 outbreak||Israel will reopen a key border crossing with the Hamas-run Gaza Strip on Sunday for the first time since Covid-19 took hold in March last year, allowing entry to hundreds of traders.The move will permit entry through the Erez crossing “for 1,000 merchants and 350 senior Gazan businesspeople,” according to a statement from the Defense Ministry. Only those already vaccinated against, or recovered from Covid-19, will be allowed to cross.Trade will also be expanded through the Kerem Shalom crossing in the south of Gaza, including equipment and goods for humanitarian infrastructure, such as water and sewage.An 11-day conflict in May between Israel’s army and Hamas fighters killed at least 243 people in Gaza and 12 people in Israel. The World Bank estimated the impoverished strip would require as much as $485 million in aid over two years to recover from the fighting, including for repairs to damaged infrastructure and reinstating essential services. More than 60% of Gazans were “food insecure,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-to-open-gaza-crossing-for-first-time-since-covid-19-outbreak-101628876292679.html
13-08-2021||World||India preps for rapid evacuation of nationals in Afghanistan amid Taliban blitz||India is prepared for all contingencies in Afghanistan, including the rapid evacuation of its officials and nationals, against the backdrop of a Taliban blitz over the past week that has seen the capture of five provincial capitals since Thursday. Elaborate plans have been prepared for the speedy withdrawal of diplomats from the embassy in Kabul and a dwindling number of Indian nationals, most of them workers engaged in development projects in Afghanistan, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. These plans include putting heavy lift aircraft of the Indian Air Force on standby round the clock, the people said. These efforts have gained urgency following reports that the US is deploying 3,000 troops to Kabul and the UK sending 600 troops to provide security for the evacuation of nationals of the two countries. India has also received requests from several international organisations, among them media outlets and rights organisations, seeking help for the possible evacuation of their personnel from Afghanistan, the people cited above said. According to information provided by the government in Parliament last week, there were 1,500 Indian nationals in Afghanistan. The people said this figure had now come down to few hundreds, including diplomats and the large security contingent at the embassy in Kabul. Another concern for Indian authorities were Indian nationals who haven’t heeded the latest security advisories calling on them to immediately return home. The latest alert issued by the Indian mission on Thursday highlighted the case of three engineers who remained at a project site in an area not controlled by Afghan forces and required an “emergency air rescue”. Among the five provincial capitals captured by the Taliban since Thursday was Pul-e-Alam, the capital of Logar, which put the group’s fighters just 70 km south of Kabul. While a recent estimate by US security agencies had stated that the Taliban could take Kabul within 30 days, the latest reports suggest the Taliban could tighten their grip on areas around the capital and march towards the city within days. Among the provincial capitals captured by the Taliban since August 6 are Zaranj, Sheberghan, Sar-e-Pul, Kunduz, Taloqan, Aybak, Pul-e-Khumri, Faizabad, Ghazni, Herat, Kandahar, Qala-e-Naw, Lashkargah, Pul-e-Alam, Tarinkot, Qalat and Firozkoh. While the fall of provincial capitals in sparsely populated regions in the north were initially attributed to the Afghan government’s new security policy focused on larger and more populated urban centres, the rapid fall of Kandahar and Herat, Afghanistan’s second and third largest cities, dramatically altered the ground situation. The capture of Ghazni also cut the highway between Kabul and southern Kandahar. Despite the Taliban being emboldened by the US drawdown and showing little inclination to return to the negotiating table, India and other countries are continuing with efforts to press for a political settlement and an immediate truce. On Thursday, India joined Germany, Qatar and Turkey in calling for an immediate ceasefire in Afghanistan and asserting that any government imposed by military force in Kabul would not be recognised. A statement issued by Qatar following a meeting of special envoys and representatives of India, Germany, Norway, Qatar, Tajikistan, Turkey and Turkmenistan in Doha also highlighted the urgent need to accelerate the process to find a negotiated settlement. The statement said two separate meetings on Afghanistan – one joined by the representatives of China, Uzbekistan, the US, Pakistan, the UK, Qatar, the UN and the European Union on August 10, and the other held on August 12 – had agreed that the participants “will not recognize any government in Afghanistan that is imposed through the use of military force”. The countries also agreed on the need to accelerate the Afghan peace process as a “very urgent and essential issue for negotiating concrete proposals from both sides”. The participants urged the Taliban and the Afghan government to “build trust and accelerate efforts to reach a political settlement and comprehensive ceasefire as quickly as possible”, and to stop “violence and attacks immediately in and against provincial capitals and other cities”. The meetings expressed “grave concerns” about reports from across Afghanistan regarding violence, high civilian casualties, extra-judicial killings, widespread and credible allegations of human rights violations, and the destruction of physical infrastructure that make reconciliation efforts more difficult. As part of desperate efforts to counter the Taliban’s advance, UN Security Council members Estonia and Norway drafted a statement to condemn the group’s attacks on cities and towns resulting in high civilian casualties. According to Reuters, the draft statement, which has to be agreed by consensus by the 15-member body, threatens sanctions for abuses and acts that risk Afghanistan’s peace and stability. The text also “strongly affirms that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is not recognized at the United Nations and declares that it does not and will not support the establishment of any government in Afghanistan imposed through military force or restoration of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan”. This is largely in line with the position taken by India, which holds the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council for August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-preps-for-rapid-evacuation-of-its-nationals-in-afghanistan-amid-taliban-blitz-101628873036460.html

To study the pandemic’s on early childhood cognitive development, researchers from Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University examined general childhood cognitive scores in 2020 and 2021 against the preceding decade by leveraging a large ongoing longitudinal study of child neurodevelopment.Since the beginning of the pandemic, countries around the world have imposed several restrictions to contain the virus, including stay-at-home orders that led to the shutting down of businesses, daycares, schools, playgrounds. The parents who could manage to work from home faced challenges in providing full-time attentive childcare.The study suggests that the children under the age of five, who have been largely spared from the severe health complications associated with Covid-19, have not been immune to the impact of social distancing measures, including stay-at-home orders. The coronavirus-induced guidelines have disrupted their educational opportunities, reduced physical activity levels, and limited interaction with other children.The study included 672 healthy children between 3 months to 3 years of age from the state of Rhode Island in the United States. The researchers found that even in the absence of direct infection, the environmental changes associated with the pandemic are significantly and negatively affecting infant and child development. The researchers also found that males and children in lower socioeconomic families were most affected.“The Covid-19 pandemic has fundamentally altered the child health landscape, with pregnant mothers and individuals, and children living in a strikingly different economic, psychosocial, and educational environment than what was present just 18 months ago,” the study says.The study is yet to be peer-reviewed and is currently available on the preprint server.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/children-born-during-covid-19-pandemic-have-reduced-cognitive-performance-study-101628867410958.html

The region was captured last week when they allegedly removed Nishan Sahib from a gurdwara in the province. Taliban Banned Using of COVID-19 Vaccines in Paktiahttps://t.co/x0O9qPbfUN pic.twitter.com/3G9TOlwzbkA video has emerged on Facebook showing how Taliban leaders partied at the residence of Marshal Abdul Rashid Dostum in Sheberghan of Jowzjan after the provincial capital in the country's north was captured last week. The video, which was not independently authenticated by Hindustan Times showed Taliban leaders sitting at a huge hall that reportedly belongs to 67-year-old Afghan warlord Dostum.An estimated 65 per cent of Afghan territory have been captured by Taliban insurgents as the force is now nearing the gates of Kabul. On Friday, the Taliban captured Kandahar, Logar province, Lashkar Gah and Herat. The situation escalated after US president Joe Biden on April 14 announced the withdrawal of the US troops from Afghanistan starting May 1. This led to Taliban insurgence and all cities, one by one, have started to fall in front of Taliban forces. Talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government on a political solution has hit a deadlock as no significant progress has been made on that front.Also Read: These provincial capitals in Afghanistan are now under Taliban controlAs Afghanistan is on the threshold, videos of what exactly is happening in the country and what the civilians of the country are doing are flooding social media platforms.

The Mujahideen reached Martyrs' Square," a Taliban spokesman tweeted, referring to a city landmark.Hours later, the Taliban said they had also taken control of Lashkar Gah, the capital of neighbouring Helmand province.A security source confirmed the fall of the city, telling AFP that the Afghan military and government officials had evacuated Lashkar Gah after striking a local ceasefire deal with the militants.The government has now effectively lost most of the country following an eight-day blitz into urban centres by the Taliban that has also stunned Kabul's American backers.The first wave of the offensive was launched in early May after the United States and its allies all but withdrew their forces from Afghanistan, with President Joe Biden determined to end two decades of war by September 11.Also Read | To save Afghanistan, act against Pakistan- 'Not abandonment' -Biden insists he does not regret his decision, but the speed and ease of the Taliban's urban victories in recent days has been a surprise and forced new calculations.Washington and London announced plans late Thursday to pull out their embassy staff and citizens from the capital."We are further reducing our civilian footprint in Kabul in light of the evolving security situation," US State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters, while noting the embassy would remain open."This is not abandonment. This is not an evacuation. This is not the wholesale withdrawal."The Pentagon said 3,000 US troops would be deployed to Kabul within the next 24 to 48 hours, underscoring they would not be used to launch attacks against the Taliban.NATO was also set to hold an urgent meeting later on Friday about the deteriorating situation, diplomatic and official sources told AFP.Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg will lead discussions with envoys from the 30 allies, with one source saying it would focus on evacuation planning.- Taliban flags across Kandahar -The conflict has escalated dramatically since May, when US-led forces began the final stage of their troop withdrawal.After months of taking what were considered less strategically important rural areas, the Taliban zeroed in on the cities.The insurgents have taken over more than a dozen provincial capitals in the past week and encircled the biggest city in the north, the traditional anti-Taliban bastion of Mazar-i-Sharif, which is now one of the few holdouts remaining.In Kandahar, resident Abdul Nafi told AFP the city was calm after the government forces pulled out early Friday."I came out this morning, I saw Taliban white flags in most squares of the city... I thought it might be the first day of Eid."Also Read | India joins other nations to assert govt forced on Afghanistan won’t be recognised- Herat strongman captured -And in Herat on Friday, the Taliban said they had captured the city's long-time strongman Ismail Khan, who helped lead the defence of the provincial capital along with his militia fighters.The warlord's spokesman later confirmed Khan had been allowed to return to his residence following negotiations with the insurgents.Pro-Taliban social media accounts have boasted of the vast spoils of war captured by the insurgents, posting photos of armoured vehicles, heavy weapons, and even a drone seized by their fighters at abandoned military bases.After being under siege for weeks, government forces on Thursday pulled out of Herat -- an ancient Silk Road city near the Iranian border -- and retreated to a district army barracks.On Thursday, the interior ministry also confirmed the fall of Ghazni, opening a corridor along the major highway to Kabul from the Taliban heartlands in the south.As the rout unravelled, three days of meetings between key international players on Afghanistan ended in Qatar without significant progress Thursday.In a joint statement, the international community, including the United States, Pakistan, the European Union, and China, said they would not recognise any government in Afghanistan "imposed through the use of military force."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-near-gates-of-kabul-as-embassies-prepare-for-evacuations-101628856688064.html

The expert made these comments according to a documentary released on Thursday by Danish television channel TV2.The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Wuhan branch was handling coronaviruses “without potentially having the same level of expertise or safety or who knows,” said Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO expert of disease transmission from animals to humans, the Associated Press reported, citing footage from the documentary. Ben Embarek made these remarks during a conference call earlier in January, the report further showed.Also read | WHO forms new expert group to continue studies into origins of Covid-19In the documentary, Ben Embarek inspected the stalls at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. He said that the exposure of people who worked in handling live animals in the market could have raised the possibility of the virus infecting people at the market, according to the AP’s report.He also expressed his concerns about the Chinese CDC’s Wuhan branch, which were not previously disclosed by the WHO. Several experts have questioned the possibility of a lab accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology but the CDC lab has not been the subject of such discussions. “What is more concerning to me is the other lab. The one that is next to the market,” AP quoted Ben Embarek as saying about the CDC lab, which is 500 meters away from the Huanan market. In a separate interview to the channel TV2 in June, Ben Embarek also had said that a lab staffer being infected with the coronavirus while collecting bat samples was “likely.” HT has not individually seen the documentary footage or the interview.However, when the WHO released its findings after its mission in Wuhan, it termed the introduction of the disease through a laboratory incident as “extremely unlikely.” Further, the report also said that a direct zoonotic spillover is considered to be “a possible-to-likely pathway.” While the report showed that the introduction of the disease through an intermediate host is considered a “likely to very likely” pathway, it also said that the introduction through cold or food chain products is a “possible pathway.” Later, WHO’s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was “premature” to rule out the possibility of a lab leak of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-origin-who-official-expressed-concerns-about-safety-at-lab-near-wuhan-market-shows-report-101628850494238.html

The attacker was trained in Afghanistan and the vehicle used in the attack was brought from Afghanistan to Pakistan…The terrorist network the attacker is associated with has received support from Indian and Afghan intelligence agencies.”In its response, the Chinese foreign ministry added that Pakistan’s investigation into the terror attack has seen major progress in quick time.“China pays great attention to this and expresses appreciation to Pakistan’s active efforts. Further investigation by Pakistan is still ongoing,” foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a statement on Friday.“China and Pakistan will follow the important consensus reached by the leaders on both sides, ascertain all the facts and truth, and hold the culprits accountable and bring them to justice,” she said.“In the meanwhile, both countries will keep strengthening security cooperation mechanisms to ensure the safety of Chinese projects, people and institutions in Pakistan,” Hua added.On Thursday, Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi claimed the deadly bus attack was a suicide bombing carried out by Islamist militants backed by Indian and Afghan intelligence agencies, according to a Reuters report.“An Indian government official said the charge was baseless and said Pakistan has made similar accusations repeatedly in the past,” Reuters added.On July 14, the bus carrying the Chinese workers on way to a dam construction site was hit by a blast in the district of Kohistan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Top Pakistani officials including Qureshi and ISI chief Faiz Hameed had rushed to China days after the explosion.After the incident, Chinese premier Li Keqiang had reportedly urged his Pakistani counterpart, Prime Minister Imran Khan, to hold accountable the culprits in what he described as a “terrorist attack”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-appreciates-pak-probe-into-bus-attack-that-killed-9-chinese-nationals-101628843392698.html

13-08-2021||World||China shoots down second WHO probe into origin of Covid-19 virus||China on Friday dismissed the World Health Organization’s (WHO) calls for a renewed probe into the origin of the Covid-19 virus, saying it supported scientific over political efforts to find out how the disease started.The proposal was also made without full consultation with member states, a senior Chinese diplomat said. “We oppose political tracing... and abandoning the joint report”, which was issued after a WHO expert team visited Wuhan in January, vice foreign minister Ma Zhaoxu told reporters. “We support scientific tracing,” Ma added.The Covid-19 virus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 before spreading in and outside China, triggering the worst pandemic in a century. The pandemic has so far claimed more than 4.3 million lives and infected over 205.3 million people, according to the US-based Johns Hopkins University’s widely followed coronavirus tracker. In a briefing with 31 representatives and ambassadors from 29 countries in Beijing, Ma said that recently the WHO secretariat came up with the working proposal for the next phase without fully consulting with its member countries, which has been rejected and doubted. Ma added that Beijing was always ready to cooperate in tracing Covid-19’s origin and had never rejected cooperation. But China rejects the politicisation of the probe, Chinese state media quoted Ma as saying.Quoting Ma, news agency Xinhua reported that China is continuing to conduct “follow-up and supplementary” research into Covid-19’s origin as specified in the WHO joint report.In terms of the next-phase of the Covid-19 origin-tracing work, it should be only done by scientists to find zoonotic origins and transmission pathways, Ma said.The WHO on Thursday urged all governments to cooperate to accelerate studies into the origin of the pandemic and “to depoliticise the situation”.Last month, Ma had told Chinese state media that 48 countries had submitted a joint letter to the WHO director-general on the origin of the Covid-19 virus.“In the letter, they welcome the report of the WHO-convened global study of origins of Sars-CoV-2: China Part, stress that the study of origins is a matter of science and oppose politicisation of this issue,” Ma had said.Blaming the US for trying to smear China over the probe into Covid-19’s origin, he had said that a few forces led by the United States ran counter to science regardless of the facts.“Facts prove again that the political manipulation by use of origin-tracing violates human conscience, and it is immoral and unpopular. The rock they are lifting will end up hitting their own toes,” he said.In June, China had angrily rejected the WHO’s plan for the second phase of the Covid-19 origin study, saying it is “shocked” by the proposal as it contains language that does not respect science.Beijing’s angry reaction came after WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in June that it was premature to rule out a potential link between the Covid-19 pandemic and a laboratory leak, adding that he had asked China to be more transparent as scientists search for the origin of the coronavirus.China has voiced strong opposition against international opinion, which says a high-security bio lab in Wuhan was the source of the virus.National health commission (NHC) vice minister Zeng Yixin told reporters in June that the WHO’s second planned probe had listed the hypothesis that China had violated lab regulations and leaked the virus as one of the major research objectives, and he was “very shocked” after reading the proposal.Zeng said China cannot accept the current version of the WHO plan because it has been compromised by political manipulation and disrespects scientific facts.“We hope the WHO can carefully consider the advice by Chinese scientists, take investigating the origin of the Covid-19 virus as a scientific question free from political interference, and proactively and properly conduct sustained investigations into the origin of the virus in various countries across the world,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-shoots-down-second-who-probe-into-origin-of-covid-19-virus-101628838652082.html

The capture of Kabul willy-nilly portrays the US as an exhausted and weak superpower as also poses strong questions on its ability to take on the rising superpower in China. It is quite evident that US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad proved to be no match for Henry Kissinger inspired withdrawal from Vietnam in the end as US forces literally ran away from Kabul without matching even the symbolic resistance in Saigon.Also read | As Taliban captures major cities, reports of killings and torture pour inWith Kabul firmly in the crosshairs of the Taliban, Afghan watchers predict that China will initially follow the lead of Pakistan, the progenitor of the Islamist insurgent group, and recognise the Sunni force as the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan. With the Taliban, Pakistan and China on the same side, human rights will be thrown out of the window and all leverage that the US and its principal advisor the UK had on Afghanistan will be reduced to zero. The next thing to watch will be the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative via the Wakhan corridor to Afghanistan, which has humongous heavy metal resources like lithium used in making the long-range submarine batteries.Also read | US to deploy over 3,000 troops to Afghanistan to help in evacuation of diplomats, special visa applicantsTaliban’s mentor or what is jokingly called the Rawalpindi shura will be the gainer in the short term as ideological leader Mullah Haibatullah Akundzada, military leaders Mullah Yaqoob and Sirajuddin Haqqani are all under the protection of Pakistan. Akundzada is said to be in Karachi military cantonment, Mullah Yaqoob is shuttling between Helmand and Quetta, and boss of Haqqani terrorist group and lately a newspaper columnist Sirajuddin is also in Quetta. Already, the best of US military equipment including Humvees, Cougars, Buffalo and Caimans along with shoulder-launched drones, area weapons and body armour have been captured by the Taliban and will be tactically moved to Pakistan from Afghanistan in a matter of time. Although UK agencies are said to have moved their communication surveillance equipment from Afghanistan, one should not be surprised if such technical equipment is now in the hands of ISI headquarters in Rawalpindi. This is predictable based on the situation on the ground but the doomsday scenario is not too far away even as the international community is ready for another talkathon at the UNGA in September 2021.Also read | British men fighting for Taliban as it mounts offensive: ReportWhile New Delhi has no options but to be prepared, it was never really in the brutal power game in Kabul as it did not send troops on the ground or even give weapons to the Afghan government. Where power speaks from AK-47 and M-4 assault rifles and daisy cutter bombs, humanitarian and infrastructure assistance mean practically zilch. India’s main challenge, however, will come when Pakistan shifts the terror training camps of terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed to Taliban-occupied Afghanistan for future terror strikes against India. Already, transnational terrorist groups like the al Qaeda, Islamic State, East Turkestan Islamic Movement and Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan are thriving under the protection of the Taliban in Afghanistan. With state of the art close-quarter US weapons available to the Taliban, the future terror strikes will be much more lethal and violent all over the world. And that includes Pakistan too, for it is only a matter of time when the fault-lines within the Taliban erupt over control of Kabul.Also read | UNSC mulling over draft statement condemning Taliban offensive: ReportIf India is going to be at the receiving end of radicalised Islamists, other countries in the region including Iran, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Myanmar will also not be secure in wake of a Sunni force taking over Kabul. The Central Asian Republics under the leadership of Russia and Shia Iran will not take things lying down and are waiting for the withdrawal of US forces and the fall of Kabul before their next move.

Forecasters issued a tropical storm watch Thursday evening for the Florida Keys and the state’s southwest coast. The hurricane center said 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to 15 centimeters) of rain were expected across the Florida Keys and southern peninsula by Monday, with isolated maximums of 8 inches (20 centimeters).The tropical storm watch also included the Cuban provinces of Ciego de Avila, Camaguey, Las Tunas, Holguin and Granma.Once a tropical storm, Fred weakened back to a depression by its spin over Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where it knocked out power to some 400,000 customers and caused flooding that forced officials to shut down part of the country's aqueduct system, interrupting water service for hundreds of thousands of people.Local officials reported hundreds of people were evacuated and some buildings were damaged. There were no immediate reports of casualties.Heavy rains on Thursday continued to pound Hispaniola, which the two nations share.The Miami-based U.S. hurricane center said Fred had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) Friday morning and was centered just north of Cuba's coast.The system was about 410 miles (660 kilometers) east-southeast of Key West, Florida. That was also about 165 miles (265 kilometers) southeast of Southern Andros Island in the Bahamas.Fred was headed west-northwest at 9 mph (15 kph).The system was expected to produce 3 to 5 inches (7.5 to 12.5 centimeters) of rain across the Dominican Republic and the western Bahamas, as well as 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.5 centimeters) over Haiti, the Turks and Caicos, the eastern Bahamas, and Cuba.Fred became the sixth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season late Tuesday as it moved past the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fred-moving-towards-florida-may-regain-tropical-storm-status-101628835684438.html

Further, in 1990, the Lefthanders International Club was founded with an aim to promote left handedness, and make their views known to manufacturers towards development of items for left-handed individuals. In 1992, the Club launched the International Lefthanders Day to create awareness regarding the “advantages and disadvantages of being left-handed.”The day is now celebrated worldwide, with around 20 events taking place in the United Kingdom alone. Though only around 10% of the world’s population is left-handed, this group includes several prominent personalities. Former two-time US president Barack Obama, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, pop singers Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga, talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Apple founder Steve Jobs etc. were all left-handed. From among historical figures, this informal group includes the likes of Sir Isaac Newton, Pablo Picasso, Napoleon Bonaparte etc.Several prominent personalities from India, too, use their left hand for day-to-day works. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, actor Amitabh Bachchan, industrialist Ratan Tata etc. are all left-handed.Left-handers are likely to have better verbal skills than their right-handed counterparts, according to a 2019 study by Oxford University. The basis of this conclusion was a discovery by the researchers that left and right hemispheres of brains of left-handed individuals had better co-ordination in regions involving the use of language. The scientists, though, also cautioned that their study sample constituted just a fraction of the world’s left-handed population, adding that more research is required to reach a definitive conclusion in this regard.Additionally, the research also found that left-handers were at slightly lower risk of both schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-lefthanders-day-2021-history-significance-and-all-you-need-to-know-101628832768990.html

13-08-2021||World||As Taliban captures major cities, reports of killings and torture pour in||The Taliban has continued to kill civilians and senior officials in Afghanistan as it swiftly and violently advances across the country capturing major cities with eyes on Kabul. The killings and torturing of civilians come even as the United Nations has warned that a Taliban offensive reaching the capital would have a "catastrophic impact on civilians".Two children were killed and four were wounded in a mortar strike by the Taliban in Khost province and a Ghazni based judge Abdul Matin Atayee was killed in an ambush on Wednesday. Several reports said the Taliban has occupied several homes in Herat city and using people as human shields against Afghan security forces. The group also looted civilian houses in several parts of the city.Also read | British men fighting for Taliban as it mounts offensive: ReportSeveral videos and photos on social media show Taliban fighters beating and shooting people, including children, in provinces like Helmand and Herat.

13-08-2021||World||China rejects need for further WHO coronavirus origins probe||China on Friday rejected the World Health Organization's calls for a renewed probe into the origins of Covid-19, saying it supported "scientific" over "political" efforts to find out how the virus started.Pressure is once more mounting on Beijing to consider a fresh probe into the orgins of a pandemic which has killed more than four million people and paralysed economies worldwide since it first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.A WHO team of international experts went to Wuhan in January 2021 to produce a first phase report, which was written in conjunction with their Chinese counterparts. It failed to find a conclusive position on how the virus began.On Thursday the WHO urged China to share raw data from the earliest Covid-19 cases to revive its probe into the origins of the disease.China hit back, repeating its position that the initial investigation was enough and that calls for further data were motivated by politics instead of scientific inquiry."We oppose political tracing ... and abandoning the joint report" issued after the WHO expert team's Wuhan visit in January, vice foreign minister Ma Zhaoxu told reporters. "We support scientific tracing."That report said the virus jumping from bats to humans via an intermediate animal was the most probable scenario, while a leak from the Wuhan virology labs was "extremely unlikely".Ma rejected suggestions of new lines of investigation."The conclusions and recommendations of WHO and China joint report were recognised by the international community and the scientific community," he said."Future global traceability work should and can only be further carried out on the basis of this report, rather than starting a new one."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rejects-need-for-further-who-coronavirus-origins-probe-101628831936613.html
13-08-2021||World||Canadian PM Justin Trudeau likely to call snap polls||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appears set to take the considerable risk of holding snap elections to secure a majority in the House of Commons despite health authorities formally declaring that a fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is now under way.According to multiple news outlets, Trudeau is expected to meet governor-general Mary Simon on Sunday for starting the election process, formally called dropping of the writ, and polls will be held on September 20. This was first reported by Reuters and the French-language outlet La Presse and confirmed by others. The Hindustan Times has also confirmed this likelihood.The Trudeau-led Liberal Party government is in a minority in the House of Commons, with 155 MPs, as against 119 for the principal Opposition party, the Conservatives. When the last Federal elections were held in October 2019, the Liberals captured 157 seats, short of the 170 majority mark and also trailed the Conservatives in vote share, with 31.1% against 34.3%.However, most polls have suggested the Liberals have a lead now, with the latest from the non-profit Angus Reid Institute putting them at 36% support, five points ahead of the Conservatives.But it stated, “As members of the fifth estate speculate about the exact date the prime minister is expected to call a general election, Canadians are more occupied by fears of a fourth wave of Covid-19 than politics.” In fact, 52% of respondents fear contracting the coronavirus, a five point increase over the figure for July.Their fears will not be assuaged by the statement on Thursday from Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam, who told reporters during a briefing: “We have been closely monitoring increases in Covid-19 activity across the country. The latest national surveillance data indicate that a fourth wave is under way in Canada and that cases are plotting along a strong resurgence trajectory.” She also said there were more than 13,000 active cases in the country, more than double the figure for late July. When questioned about the possible election, Tam demurred and said, “It’s not my role to advise on whether there should be an election or not.”Earlier this week, the Ottawa-based watchdog organisation Democracy Watch started a petition asking the governor-general to turn down a request for snap elections, stating such polls “would be illegal, dishonest, and unfair and dangerous for many voters”.But such a refusal from the governor-general hasn’t occurred in 95 years and seems extremely unlikely and Canadians appear to be headed back to the polls less than two years since the last Federal elections were held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-trudeau-likely-to-call-snap-polls-101628830790988.html

These troops will deploy to the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul immediately. Another 1,000 personnel will be sent to Qatar to process Afghans who are being evacuated and relocated to the US on special visa. Another 3,500 troops will deploy from a base in the US to Kuwait to stand prepared to be sent to Afghanistan if needed.Defence secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered the department to “position temporary enabling capabilities to ensure the safety and security of US and partner civilian personnel”, said John Kirby, the chief Pentagon spokesperson, at a news briefing, referring to an earlier order from President Joe Biden reducing US diplomatic presence.“I want to stress that these forces are being deployed to support the orderly and safe reduction of civilian personnel at the request of the state department and to help facilitate an accelerated process of working through SIV applicants,” Kirby said, adding, “This is a temporary mission with a narrow focus.”The additional deployment announcement came amidst growing concerns in Biden administration with the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, as a result of the Taliban advancing far more rapidly than anticipated.Kirby insisted the additional deployment will not affect the withdrawal timeline, which is geared towards completion by the end August.The US had planned to leave about 650 troops after the completion of the drawdown for the security of its embassy and personnel. But, it’s now beefing up its presence. Although it’s a temporary measure, Kirby gave no indication to the duration of their planned stay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-deploy-3-000-troops-to-afghanistan-101628828690729.html

The Sun cited a senior military intelligence official as saying they have intercepted phone calls of terrorists with British accents. "We have received some intercepts of two British men, probably below 30, talking openly on mobiles," the official was quoted as saying by The Sun.The Taliban captured Kandahar, the country's second-largest city, on Friday in what is one of the group's biggest military victories since it began the offensive in May.Another unnamed security personnel said there was “intermittent intelligence” showing British men had taken up arms against the Afghan government. “We have no idea who they are. It’s difficult to put a number on it,” the official told The Sun.Also read | Taliban claim to capture Afghanistan's second-largest city of Kandahar: ReportsAccording to The Sun, security officials believe that the British men travelled to Afghanistan through Pakistan’s tribal areas to reach the frontlines. Days ago, Taliban commander General Mubeen was heard talking in a Facebook video about attending Birmingham University.“Many British and other foreign jihadists travelled to Afghanistan before and after 9/11 to fight there and, in many cases train, organise and then travel elsewhere for jihad,” former colonel Richard Kemp, who led UK forces in Afghanistan, told The Sun. “The more gains the Taliban makes, the more it will encourage jihadists to carry out attacks at home and also head for Afghanistan," he said,"If the country, or a large part of it, is permanently controlled by the Taliban it will again become a safe haven for terrorists as it was before 9/11. We are on the verge of a threat no less than that from IS at its height.”Also read | UNSC mulling over draft statement condemning Taliban offensive: ReportIt came as Britain said it would deploy around 600 troops to Afghanistan to help its citizens and interpreters and other Afghan staff leave Afghanistan. The UK defence ministry said in a statement the troops will provide protection and logistical support for the relocation of British nationals where required. Around 4,000 British nationals are believed to be in Afghanistan.The US has also said that it is sending an additional 3,000 troops to Afghanistan to assist in the evacuation of some personnel from the USe embassy in Kabul.The Taliban captured Kandahar along with more key regional cities as US military intelligence assessment suggested Kabul could come under Taliban within 30 days. It also said that the group could gain full control of the country within a few months. Most of the country is now under the Taliban's control.

For SARS-CoV-2, it will support the rapid undertaking of recommended studies outlined in the March 2021 report," the WHO said in a statement on Thursday.WHO last month proposed a second phase of studies into the origins of the coronavirus in China, including audits of laboratories and markets in the city of Wuhan. Beijing, meanwhile, had rejected WHO's proposal.In a statement issued on Thursday, WHO called for all governments to depoliticize the situation."To move forward, WHO calls for all governments to depoliticize the situation and cooperate to accelerate the origins studies, and importantly to work together to develop a common framework for future emerging pathogens of pandemic potential," the statement read.The WHO expressed hope that all countries, including China, can collaborate and put in place the conditions for more missions to be sent to Wuhan to duly probe the "lab hypothesis."The WHO declared the Covid-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. To date, more than 205 million people have been infected with the coronavirus worldwide, and more than 4.3 million died, according to the US-based Johns Hopkins University.The first WHO fact-finding mission to China's Wuhan, where the first Covid-19 outbreak was reported in late 2019, released its report in March. A WHO-led team of scientists struggled to get a clear picture of what research China was conducting beforehand, faced constraints during its visit, and had little power to conduct thorough and impartial research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-forms-new-expert-group-to-continue-studies-into-origins-of-covid19-101628822719326.html

The statement, seen by the Reuters news agency, is reportedly being drafted by the countries of Estonia and Norway. The draft has to be agreed upon by the 15-member UN body before it becomes a formal condemnation, the agency cited diplomats as saying.Also Read | Taliban claim to capture Afghanistan's second-largest city of Kandahar: ReportsThe UNSC draft statement, once formal, would condemn “in the strongest terms possible” the armed attacks by Taliban forces on cities and towns across Afghanistan, which have resulted in a large number of civilian casualties. The development comes amid a highly precarious political situation in the country, as the Taliban insurgents continue to take over provincial capitals in a move to further pressurise the Ashraf Ghani government operating from Kabul.Taliban claimed to have captured Kandahar, the second-largest city in Afghanistan and the birthplace of the movement, on Friday. According to news agencies, the insurgents have taken control of as many as 12 of Afghanistan's provincial capitals by now and still continue to press forward with mounting offensives.The UNSC draft statement condemning the Taliban "strongly affirms that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is not recognized at the United Nations and declares that it does not and will not support the establishment of any government in Afghanistan imposed through military force or restoration of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan."Also Read | Powered by Pakistan, Taliban racing towards KabulThe draft text also underlines a council "readiness to impose additional measures on those responsible for violations or abuses of human rights or violations of international humanitarian law, including those involved in attacks targeting civilians, and individuals or entities engaging in, or providing support for, acts that threaten peace, stability or security."Deborah Lyons, the UN special envoy for Afghanistan, told the Security Council last week that the situation in the country has entered a “deadlier and more destructive phase” and also doubted the Taliban's commitment to a political settlement. (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsc-mulling-over-draft-statement-condemning-taliban-offensive-report-101628820616526.html

Taliban fighters rushed past the Great Mosque in the historic city and seized government buildings. Witnesses described hearing sporadic gunfire at one government building while the rest of the city fell silent under the insurgents’ control.In neighbouring Kandahar, the Taliban attacked a prison in the city and freed inmates inside on Wednesday night, officials said. On Thursday, Kandahar’s provincial governor spokesman Bahir Ahmadi acknowledged that the Taliban had entered the capital, Kandahar city, but said Afghan forces were fighting to push them back.Earlier, the capture of Ghazni cut off a crucial highway linking the Afghan capital with the country’s southern provinces, which similarly find themselves under assault as part of an insurgent push some 20 years after US and Nato troops ousted the Taliban government.While Kabul itself isn’t directly under threat immediately, the losses and the battles elsewhere further tighten the grip of a resurgent Taliban, who are estimated to now hold over two-thirds of the nation and are continuing to pressure government forces in several other provincial capitals.400,000 people displacedNearly 400,000 people have been displaced in Afghanistan since the start of the year, with a massive spike in numbers since May, Stephane Dujarric, a spokesperson for United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday amid the deteriorating security situation in the war-torn country.Clashes erupt at borderPakistani forces clashed on Thursday with hundreds of Afghans stranded on Pakistan’s side of a border crossing with Afghanistan after its closure by Taliban insurgents.The disturbances broke out after an Afghan traveller died from a heart attack as he waited in the heat to enter Afghanistan via the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing.

Another female died a short time later in hospital, the police added.Police had earlier described the shooting as a "serious firearms incident" and said the situation was contained.

13-08-2021||World||Taliban advance on major Afghan cities as US, UK troops to aid evacuations||The United States and Britain said on Thursday they would send thousands of troops to Afghanistan to help evacuate civilians, as the Taliban stood poised for their two biggest military victories since they began a broad offensive in May.In response to the militants' swift and violent advances  that are further loosening the Afghan government's hold on the country, the Pentagon said it would temporarily send about 3,000 extra troops within 48 hours to help evacuate embassy staff.Britain said it would deploy around 600 troops to help its nationals and local translators get out.While it is common for the US military to send in troops to evacuate personnel in combat zones, the reinforcements will fly in just weeks before the departure of the last of the US-led international force that has had a core role in maintaining security in the country.South and west of Kabul, the country's second- and third-largest cities were on the verge of being seized by the Taliban.The fall of major cities was a sign that Afghans welcome the Taliban, a spokesperson for the group said, according to Al Jazeera TV. The Taliban were ousted by US-led troops in 2001 after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.The Islamist group claimed control over Herat close to the Iranian border, and a diplomatic source and a witness said it also appeared close to capturing Kandahar in the south, the spiritual home of the group that now controls about two-thirds of the country.Earlier in the day, the Taliban established a bridgehead within 150 km (95 miles) of Kabul.As the United Nations warned that a Taliban offensive reaching the capital would have a "catastrophic impact on civilians," the United States, as well as Germany, urged their citizens to leave Afghanistan immediately.In Qatar, international envoys to Afghan negotiations called for an accelerated peace process as a "matter of great urgency," and for an immediate halt to attacks on cities.'WE ARE RETURNING TO A DARK TIME'If its capture is confirmed, Herat would be the 10th provincial capital - and the most significant - that the Taliban have taken in the past week."As you can see, we are inside the Herat police headquarters right now," a Taliban fighter said in a video that the group's spokesperson, Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, shared.In Kandahar, most parts of the city were under the group's control but fighting was still going on, a Taliban commander told Reuters.A women's rights activist there, who asked not to be named for security reasons, said heavy clashes were under way and only the city's military bases and airport remained under government control.She felt certain that restrictions imposed on women by the Taliban when the group ruled the country from 1996-2001 would return."We can no longer talk about women's rights. We are returning to a dark time where there is no hope," she said.Earlier on Thursday, the Taliban captured Ghazni, situated on the Kandahar-to-Kabul road some 150 km (90 miles) southwest of the capital.On Wednesday, a US defense official cited US intelligence as saying the Taliban could isolate Kabul in 30 days and possibly take it over within 90.With phone lines down across much of the country, Reuters was unable to contact government officials to confirm which of the cities under attack remained in government hands.URGED TO LEAVEThe speed and violence of the Taliban offensive have sparked recriminations among many Afghans over President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw US troops and leave the government to fight alone.Biden said on Tuesday he does not regret his decision, noting that Washington has spent more than $1 trillion over 20 years in America's longest war and lost thousands of troops. He added the United States continues to provide significant air support, food, equipment and salaries to Afghan forces.Al Jazeera reported a government source saying it had offered the Taliban a share in power if the violence stopped. It was not clear to what extent the reported offer differed from terms already discussed in Qatar.Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said he was unaware of any such offer but ruled out sharing power."We won't accept any offer like this because we don’t want to be partner with the Kabul administration. We neither stay nor work for a single day with it," he said.In a deal struck with former US President Donald Trump's administration last year, the insurgents agreed not to attack US-led foreign forces as they withdraw. The Taliban also made a commitment to discuss peace.But intermittent talks with representatives of the US-backed government have made no progress, with the insurgents apparently intent on a military victory.The international envoys in Doha, who met with Afghan government negotiators and Taliban representatives, also reaffirmed that foreign capitals would not recognise any government in Afghanistan "imposed through the use of military force."Given the speed of the Taliban's advance, prospects for diplomatic pressure to affect the situation on the ground seemed limited, although the Taliban spokesman told Al Jazeera: "We will not close the door to the political track."Critics said the rapid erosion of Afghan government-held territory and the hasty American evacuation called to mind the fall of Saigon during the Vietnam War."This is a huge foreign policy failure with generationalramifications just shy of seven months into this administration. Everything points to a complete collapse," said former State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-advance-on-major-afghan-cities-as-us-uk-troops-to-aid-evacuations-101628804826128.html

In Florida, the federal government has deployed hundreds of ventilators to Florida in a rare tapping of the Strategic National Stockpile for that equipment.The scramble comes as hospitals in hard-hit states say they’re reaching surge capacity, canceling elective procedures again and turning away transfer patients, a jolting warning for parts of the country where cases are just beginning to rise again.“What we’re running short of most critically is staffing,” said Hilton Raethel, chief executive officer of the Healthcare Association of Hawaii, which just contracted for 550 new hospital workers -- mostly nurses -- at a cost of $46 million for eight weeks.Mississippi could see “failure of the hospital system” within 10 days, Alan Jones, a top official with the University of Mississippi Medical Center, said Wednesday.Hospitals in the US have admitted an average of 9,700 patients over the past seven days, an increase of 31% from the prior week, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said during a news briefing Thursday.Those numbers are all the more challenging because hospitals are now contending with a major rush of Covid-19 patients alongside non-Covid traffic that had been returning to normal levels. In many states, commerce and tourism have also staged a comeback, meaning those looking to bring in outside staff will have to compete with leisure travelers for the price of rooms and other transportation.In 17 states, at least 15% of hospitals are experiencing critical staffing shortages, up from 12 two weeks earlier, HHS data show.Covid-19 patients still represent less than half of intensive-care unit beds in every state. But hospital administrators fear they won’t have enough staff overall to treat critically ill patients, with our without Covid-19. Many have already had to cancel elective procedures again and turn away transfer patients from other facilities. Some are facing surging waiting times in emergency departments.Surgeries DelayedRobert Peltier, chief medical officer with North Oaks Health System in Louisiana, said he would never forget the challenge of telling a recent brain surgery candidate that his procedure would have to wait.“All this gentlemen could say was, ‘You must have a hard job,’” said Peltier. “This guy was facing something that if he bleeds he is probably not going to make it. He had a time-sensitive procedure that I’m having to cancel.”The man eventually got his surgery.Often, hospitals have the beds but not the staffing, especially in some overwhelmed rural areas such as those in Texas, according to Stephen Love, chief executive of Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council. “We already have a very exhausted staff,” Love said.In the South, hospitalizations have soared far faster than in earlier waves. And even though patients have tended to be somewhat younger, many have gotten so sick that they’ve flooded intensive-care units.In Florida, some hospitals have already done all they can to retrofit spare space in conference rooms and cafeterias for patients, according to Mary Mayhew, chief executive officer of the Florida Hospital Association.“Hospitals are aggressively looking at ways to recruit travel nurses through staffing agencies,” she said. “But that is more and more difficult as other states are experiencing increases in Covid hospitalizations.”She said the facilities in her network continue to face logistical challenges such as ensuring adequate oxygen supplies, given the recent surge in demand. Earlier this week, the Strategic National Stockpile had to deploy 200 ventilators and 100 high-flow nasal cannula kits to the Sunshine State, a type of request that had become rare since the height of the pandemic.LouAnn Woodward, vice chancellor for health affairs at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, said hospitals are sometimes forced to make difficult calls on whether to add beds or not.“You might just think, ‘OK, well then open them,’” she said. “But things get to a point where you feel like the situation is not safe and you’re not providing the appropriate level of care to the patient.”Heather Freiheit, a nurse who has been working as a liaison for the US government in hard-hit hospitals, said health-care staff are as tired as they have ever been.“It’s emotionally draining for health-care providers to have to go in day after day and care for patients,” said Freiheit, who works as an operations officer for the Department of Health and Human Services and is currently deployed in Louisiana, “especially when most of the patients we’re seeing right now are unvaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-in-us-hospitals-pushed-to-brink-as-delta-sparks-hunt-for-more-staff-101628793250736.html
13-08-2021||India||Class 12 student petitions SC, demands resumption of physical classes in schools||A Class 12 student has approached the Supreme Court demanding resumption of physical classes in schools claiming that deprivation of regular schooling was affecting the psyche of the student community leading to depression and social reclusiveness. The student, Amar Prem Prakash, a resident of Delhi, said that on account of the present situation where some states had decided to reopen while many remain indecisive, the student community at large is in a dilemma and a state of confusion with a severe sense of “deprivation and discrimination” as most public places and gatherings are being permitted by state governments since July this year. The petition was filed on Friday and is yet to come up for hearing before the Court. Tired of the protracted and sustained online school teaching, the petition filed through advocate Ravi Prakash Mehrotra said, “The relentless and never-ending deprivation of regular schooling and teaching in the congenial and academic environment of a student’s educational institution is leaving an indelible mark on the psyche of the student community and taking a heavy toll on their wellness and psychological mental framework, leading at times to depression and social reclusiveness.” The petition echoed the sentiments of the student community as a whole, particularly the underprivileged and voiceless children, many of whom were unable to join virtual classes due to economic crisis prevailing in their homes. Requesting the Court to step in considering the plight faced by the students at large and those who are unable to attend virtual classes for financial reasons, the petitioner said, “A holistic and considered decision in regard to reopening of schools will not only end the uncertainty and speculation in this regard but also assuage the sentiments of the student community, in addressing their concerns and feelings in regard to the most important area off their growing up and formative years in life.” The petition comes at a time when several states have at least partially decided to reopen schools. The states of Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh will be opening all classes beginning next week while some states such as Punjab, Odisha, and Madhya Pradesh have already opened schools. About 11 states and union territories have allowed senior and higher secondary classes to function while Delhi, West Bengal, Assam and Rajasthan have not taken a decision to reopen schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/class-12-student-petitions-sc-demands-resumption-of-physical-classes-in-schools-101628879099273.html
13-08-2021||India||Top court asks hospital to consider waiving bills for Covid-19 patient||The Supreme Court on Friday asked Secunderabad-based hospital Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) Limited to consider waiving unpaid bills running up to ₹14 lakh of a man fully on lung support after his wife had approached the top court for financial support.The woman Sheela Mehra, a resident of Madhya Pradesh, had spent more than ₹one crore on treating her husband, Manish Kumar Gohiya since he contracted Covid-19 and was diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on May 14. With his lungs completely damaged, he was brought to KIMS Hospital on July 7 and placed with an ECMO machine, expanded as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine, which acts as an artificial lung to support life.Mehra in her petition filed through advocate Krishna Kumar Singh demanded a sum of ₹one crore to arrange for a lung transplant operation that was estimated to cost her nearly ₹55 lakh.Earlier this week, the Court had asked the 31-year-old woman to serve a copy of her petition to KIMS Hospital realizing there was little that they could do in this regard, considering that the petitioner had no legal right to seek assistance from the PM Cares Fund, PM Relief Fund or the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. Already, the petitioner had been provided ₹5 lakh out of the central welfare funds.Appearing for the hospital, advocate Shrinivas Rao informed the Court that the condition of the patient was improving and there was a possibility that he may not require a transplant. He informed the Court that as on date, the petitioner had an outstanding amount of ₹14 lakh towards treatment cost.The bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose said, “We are not going to issue any order but ask the hospital to consider if they can waive anything. See if they can be generous in this regard.” The Court posted the matter for Monday to enable the lawyer to take instructions and report to the Court.The Court also expressed satisfaction on the improving condition of the patient and asked the hospital to inform whether a lung transplant surgery would be necessary.Gohiya was admitted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal after he was detected with Covid-19 and was shifted in an air ambulance on June 2 to Hyderabad-based Yashoda Hospital where a CT scan revealed that his lungs had suffered 100 per cent damage. He required ECMO machine to survive and the only hospital that had one was KIMS Hospital. He was shifted to KIMS on July 7 and his family incurred a daily expense of ₹1.5 lakh to keep him going on ECMO support.Taking note of the plight of the petitioner, the bench had asked the Centre to consider providing an ECMO machine at a hospital in every district. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre, agreed to take up this suggestion with the Union Health Minister and get back to the Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-court-asks-hospital-to-consider-waiving-bills-for-covid-19-patient-101628877844650.html
13-08-2021||India||3 more Delta+ deaths take Maha tally to 5||Three more deaths linked to the Delta Plus variant of the coronavirus have been reported from Maharashtra, taking the total count to five in the state. The deceased — all senior citizens — were from Raigad, Beed and Ratnagiri districts. The Raigad patients was a 69-year-old journalist from Nagothane with diabetes and hypertension and was admitted to a civil hospital for nearly 17 days. He succumbed on July 22. According to civil surgeon Dr Suhas Mane, the deceased was fully vaccinated in May. During the contact tracing exercise, the Raigad health officials found four family members of the journalist infected with Covid-19. “We have sent their samples for genome sequencing. However, none of them had severe disease and all of them recovered at home,” said Raigad’s district health officer Dr Sudhakar More. The deceased from Beed was a 78-year-old man hospitalised on June 5 and discharged on June 29. He succumbed at home on July 5. “He did not have any known comorbid conditions. He had recovered and gone home but died suddenly,” said Dr Raus Shaikh, acting district health officer of Beed adding that he was unvaccinated. None of his contacts have tested positive for Covid-19. The fatality from Ratnagiri was a 73-year-old man from the Sangameshwar taluka. While the health officials could not retrieve his vaccination details, they said that he was admitted at Mumbai’s St George Hospital for treatment and had succumbed on May 29. Maharashtra’s first Delta Plus fatality- an 80-year-old woman- was also from Ratnagiri’s Sangameshwar taluka. Since then, 12 Delta Plus cases have been identified from the district and majority are from Sangameshwar. The state’s second death was a 63-year-old fully vaccinated woman from Mumbai. An infection with a variant can only be determined by whole genome sequencing, which takes time and specialised lab work, The total number of known Delta Plus cases from Maharashtra now stands at 66, including a latest patient identified from Thane district. Delta Plus or AY.1 contains additional mutations of the highly transmissible Delta variant (B.1.617.2). More than 80% of samples from Maharashtra have the Delta variant, labelled as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization in May. The Delta Plus was labelled as a variant of concern by the Union Health Ministry in June. Two of the three Delta Plus deaths in Maharashtra – the latest one from Raigad and the one from Mumbai – have been reported in fully vaccinated people. Covid-19 infections that occur 14 days after being fully vaccinated are known as breakthrough infections. “Vaccines are an important tool to fight the ongoing pandemic as they reduce the risk of infection as well as complications,” said infectious disease expert Dr Om Shrivastav, who is also a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force. “But the chances of re-infection or breakthrough infections remain, which is why one must continue to adhere to Covid norms such as wearing a mask, washing hands and maintaining a physical distance. People with comorbid conditions have to be even more careful,” he said. According to Shrivastav, the United States has been struggling with a lot of Delta and Delta Plus cases. “We don’t know how intense our third wave will be. Therefore, we should not be complacent on any aspects related to the pandemic,” he said. Some experts said that the variants and related deaths highlight the need for booster doses of the vaccine, especially for the immunocompromised population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-more-delta-deaths-take-maha-tally-to-5-101628877601706.html

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has also been invited to the meeting. Sena leader Sanjay Raut said Thackeray will attend the meeting. NCP MP Supriya Sule also confirmed Pawar’s attendance at the event.The Congress is a part of the Sena-led ruling coalition in Maharashtra along with the NCP.An aide of the TMC supremo said the ruling camp in Bengal has received the invite for the virtual meet to be hosted by Gandhi on August 20 and Banerjee is likely to attend the same.Stalin, who piloted his DMK to a spectacular win in the April 6 assembly election in Tamil Nadu, is also likely to attend the virtual interaction with Sonia Gandhi.A senior DMK leader said Stalin, president of the ruling party in Tamil Nadu, would attend if invited. "We are expecting an official invite today. Probably, it will be received by his (chief minister's) office," he said.The DMK chief has been following the footsteps of his late father M Karunanidhi in inviting Congress leaders to the southern state on various occasions and has always painted a picture of unity with them.Even while organising protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, both the parties, who are allies, presented a show of strength in opposing the Modi government.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-oppn-leaders-set-to-attend-virtual-meeting-called-by-sonia-gandhi-on-aug-20-101628876041366.html

TMC's Mukul Roy says BJP will win bypoll, for second time in a week||Trinamool Congress leader Mukul Roy on Friday stirred a controversy after he predicted the victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in his constituency whenever a by-election is held. Roy, who returned to the ruling camp after winning the Assembly election on a BJP seat, had made a similar comment on August 6 when he said the BJP will win the by-poll in Bengal.On both occasions, he quickly corrected his mistake by saying that he had meant the Trinamool Congress. On Friday, he further said the TMC will do well in the 2023 assembly elections in Tripura.Officially, still the BJP MLA of Krishnanagar North constituency, the Mamata Banerjee government has made Roy the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the state Assembly following his return to the TMC a month after Banerjee's party came back to power with a thumping majority. "The BJP will win if a by-election is held in Krishnanagar North," Roy told reporters after attending a PAC meeting on the Assembly premises. When asked if the TMC will not be able to win the seat, he said it will be decided by the people of that constituency. Regarding his official status as a legislator, Roy said, "I am an MLA of the BJP."Roy further said he was ready to visit Tripura to work for the TMC if asked by the party leadership. "I will do whatever is told by the party. The BJP is not doing the right thing in Tripura. Our party will do well in the next polls there," he added. At least 14 leaders and workers of the TMC, including those injured in an alleged attack by BJP workers, were arrested in Tripura on August 8 for "violating Covid norms". Two other TMC workers were nabbed on August 11. Senior TMC leaders from West Bengal are of late visiting the NE state where the assembly election is due in 2023.TMC deputy chief whip in West Bengal assembly Tapas Roy refused to comment on Roy's gaffe, while the BJP said that the people will judge such statements.The senior dear said, "It will be proper for you to ask Mukul Roy what he meant. Since I was not present during the interaction, I won't comment." He added he had attended Friday's PAC meeting chaired by Mukul Roy.BJP MLA and leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari said Roy was greeted with much fanfare when he reached the TMC office to join after winning on a BJP ticket. "Now if he makes such statements, it is for people of the state to judge. He was accorded high security by the state government, he was made the PAC chairman. Now let the TMC see," he said.The BJP has demanded Roy’s disqualification as a member of the assembly under anti-defection law and his removal from the post of PAC chairman which traditionally goes to the Opposition party. The TMC leadership has been saying that Roy is a BJP MLA and hence, his appointment as the PAC chairman would not pose any problem on technical ground.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/faux-pas-tmc-s-mukul-roy-says-bjp-will-win-bypoll-for-second-time-in-a-week-101628873548915.html

13-08-2021||India||Mr PM, a straight Q for you: Here's what Derek O'Brien wants to know from Modi||Trinamool Congress national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP on Friday uploaded a new video wherein he wanted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to answer why was he missing in Parliament when the crucial Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Bill, 2021, was passed even as two former PMs -- Manmohan Singh and HD Deve Gowda -- remained present and voted for the same. O’Brien said his latest video was a follow-up to his eight-question clip put up a day ago for eight central ministers, all of which have remained unanswered so far.O’Brien, who has very active on social media in attacking the central government over its running of business in Parliament during the just-concluded monsoon session, said he was not surprised that none of his questions have so been answered by any of the ministers in the last 24 hours and hence, he wanted to “try their boss” on Friday, the 13th.Also read | 'Mr Modi, Come listen to us': Derek O'Brien shares Oppn's message on Parl logjam"Here is a straight question to you… Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and former Prime Minister Deve Gowda - they were present during voting on a constitutional bill.

Here’s our 2nd video in 24 hrs. I asked 8 Qs to Ministers about #Parliament Zero answers. Mr PM, here's a straight Q for you.Why were U missing from Parliament?

It's your duty to answer us now. Eight ministers couldn't, Prime Minister, your time starts now," he further said.On Thursday, the TMC MP had directed his questions at the eight Union ministers who had held a press conference hours ago to slam the Opposition’s “unruly” conduct in the Parliament during the past few days that they alleged was the reason behind the abrupt ending of the session, two days ahead of its schedule.Calling them “full of faff”, O’Brien wanted them to reply to questions like “why were 38 bills passed in both houses with an average discussion time of 10 minutes per bill and why has only one out of 10 bills gone from the Lok Sabha for parliamentary scrutiny”.8 Ministers just addressed a press conference. To them, we ask. Answer even one of these 8 questions. Try. Then talk to us about #Parliament.The United Opposition have a strong case. You are full of faff.

Whose business is it to run Parliament? Is it the government's responsibility or the opposition's responsibility? And who is the government accountable to? The people," he added.On Thursday too he had asked why “the PM had not answered a single question in the Rajya Sabha in the last five years”. “Manmohan Singh ji answered 22 questions. Why in two years, the government hasn't elected a Deputy Speaker in the Lok Sabha?" the MP further said.The Modi government and the Opposition have been locked in a bitter battle over the conduct of Parliament with both sides refusing to budge over issues like the Pegasus scandal, farmers protest, inflation and Covid-19 management. The Opposition has been demanding the PM or Home Minister Amit Shah make a statement on the floor of Parliament on the snooping issue. Modi had come to Parliament only once during this session to introduce his ministers in the newly revamped cabinet. His speech was, however, disrupted a number of times when Opposition leaders began raising slogans on the rising prices of fuel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mr-pm-a-straight-q-for-you-here-s-what-derek-o-brien-wants-to-know-from-modi-101628868569966.html
13-08-2021||India||Assam assembly passes cattle preservation legislation, opposition walks out||The Assam assembly on Friday passed legislation regulating transportation, slaughter and sale of cattle, beef and beef products in the state. The Assam Cattle Preservation Bill, 2021 was passed on the last day of the budget session after a discussion lasting over two hours through a voice vote. The Bill was passed after opposition members, who had sought sending the Bill to a select committee, had staged a walkout from the House. Opposition members had suggested 76 amendments to the Bill including removal of restrictions on inter-district transportation of cattle, relaxation of the ban on slaughter of cattle within a 5 km radius of temples, ‘satras’ (Vaishnavite monasteries) etc., and the strict penalties like eight year imprisonment and heavy fines for violations of the Bill. They said that the state would lose a large amount in revenue as the cattle trade in Assam is worth ₹20,000 crores annually. Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma informed the House that buffaloes would be exempted from provisions of the Bill. “Data shows that most cases of communal tension in Lower Assam in the past few years are related to beef. The provisions of the Bill will lead to communal harmony as it would allow those who consume beef to eat it with some restrictions and also respect the sentiments of non-beef eating communities like Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs,” said Sarma. “We don’t have any ill intention in introducing the Bill. And real Muslims who understand it would have no opposition to it. There’s no ban on eating beef, those who want can eat it 5 km away from temples and ‘satras’. Communal harmony can prevail only when Muslims respect sentiments of Hindus as much as Hindus respect the sentiments of Muslims,” he added. Termed The Assam Cattle Preservation Bill, 2021, the legislation puts a ban on inter-state transport of cows through Assam in order to control their smuggling to neighbouring Bangladesh. The Bill bans transport of cattle from other states through Assam to places outside the state. It also stops transport of cattle from any place within Assam to places outside the state “where slaughter of cattle is not regulated by law”. Transport of cattle from places outside Assam to any place within the state will also be banned by the legislation. Further, movement of cattle from one place within the state to another located in Assam will also be restricted. However, a competent authority may issue permit for transport of cattle for bona-fide agricultural or animal husbandry purposes. The Bill bans sale of beef in areas which have predominant population of Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and other non-beef-eating communities or within a radius of 5 km of any temple, ‘satra’ (Vaishnavite monastery) “or other religious institutions belonging to Hindu religion”. Violations of the provisions of the Bill could lead to imprisonment for three to eight years and fine between ₹3 lakh and ₹5 lakh. “The proposed Bill in its present form can lead to various problems for people associated with cattle trade, beef products and business in cattle skin etc. I propose that it should be sent to a select committee of assembly to get their views on its efficacy,” said Congress legislature party leader Debabrata Saikia. “Instead of looking at this Bill from a religious perspective, one needs to view it from other angles. Unlike popularly believed, consumption of beef is not mandatory among Muslims and Christians. It is a food product like any other. We should see what impact socio-economic impact the Bill would have in Assam,” said All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) MLA Aminul Islam. “Only those animals and other species which are endangered or face threat of extinction, like rhinos in Assam, needs protection. Reply by government to my question in the ongoing assembly session has revealed that the cattle population in Assam has increased every year and as per a 2020 survey the state has over 10.9 million heads of cattle Both Islam and Saikia argued that restrictions in the present Bill regarding slaughter and sale of cattle would impact those involved in cattle trade and owners of cattle would be forced to leave their old and diseased animals on the streets due to costs involved in their upkeep. This in turn could lead to traffic accidents and damage to crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-assembly-passes-cattle-preservation-legislation-opposition-walks-out-101628869014607.html

13-08-2021||India||India rubbishes Pakistan foreign minister’s allegations on attack that killed 9 Chinese nationals||India on Friday rejected the Pakistan foreign minister’s claim that the Indian and Afghan spy agencies were behind a suicide attack on a bus last month that killed nine Chinese nationals, saying it was an attempt to deflect global attention from Pakistan’s “role as the epicentre of regional instability”. Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had contended on Thursday that the bombing was carried out by terrorists backed by the Indian and Afghan intelligence agencies. He claimed an investigation revealed a “nexus of Indian RAW and Afghan NDS” in the attack, referring to the intelligence agencies of the two countries. Qureshi told a news conference that the Pakistani Taliban carried out the attack. “As per our investigation, the Afghan soil was used for this incident...about its planning and its execution, we’re seeing a clear nexus between NDS and RAW,” he added. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi rubbished Qureshi’s allegations and described them as “absurd comments”. He added, “This is yet another attempt by Pakistan to malign India, in a bid to deflect international attention from its role as the epicentre of regional instability and a safe haven for proscribed terrorists.” Bagchi said India has been at the forefront of global efforts against terrorism in partnership with the international community, “which is well aware of Pakistan’s credentials when it comes to terrorism”. He added, “Such desperate attempts by Pakistan at peddling lies and propaganda will therefore find few takers.” The July 14 attack on the bus carrying workers to a hydropower project site at Dasu in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province resulted in the death of nine Chinese nationals and four more people. Pakistani authorities have made several flip-flops on the attack, claiming hours after the blast that it was caused by a mechanical failure that resulted in a gas leak. The Chinese side said immediately after the attack that the bus was hit by a blast. After traces of explosives were found at the site, Pakistani authorities said an attack couldn’t be ruled out. On Thursday, Qureshi said the bus blast was a suicide bombing and that the Chinese side was satisfied with the investigation done by Pakistani authorities. The incident had prompted Chinese Premier Li Keqiang to urge his Pakistani counterpart last month to hold the culprits accountable for what he described as a terrorist attack. Both Qureshi and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief had visited Beijing last month to placate the Chinese side. On Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s investigation into the attack. She reiterated Pakistan’s contention that planning for the attack was done in Afghanistan and it was executed by the Pakistani Taliban. Hua also said: “The terrorist network the attacker is associated with has received support from Indian and Afghan intelligence agencies.” The developments come at a time when India’s relations with Pakistan and China are strained. Indian troops have been engaged in a standoff with Chinese forces along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh for more than a year, and relations between New Delhi and Islamabad have been troubled over a string of terror attacks in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rubbishes-pakistan-foreign-minister-s-allegations-on-attack-that-killed-9-chinese-nationals-101628866434569.html

Cyrus Poonawalla presents 2 scenarios||If the mix of Covishield and Covaxin fails, Serum Institute of India can claim that the other vaccine was not good, while the other company can also say that Serum's vaccine is not good, Serum's chairman Dr Cyrus Poonawalla said expressing his reservation against cocktail of Covid-19 vaccines, the study of which has been granted by the Drugs Control General of India. "I am against the mixing of two different vaccines. There is no need to mix two different vaccines," the senior Poonawalla said.Covishield, developed by Astrazenaca and Oxford University and manufactured by Serum Institute in India is an adenovirus vector platform-based vaccine. Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, the other main vaccine in India's immunisation programme, is an inactivated whole virus vaccine."If cocktail vaccines are administered and if the result is not good, then SII may say that another vaccine was not good, vice versa, the other company might say that since you mixed Serum's vaccine, it did not give desired results," Poonawalla said.While several international studies are championing for a concktail of vaccines, Cyrus Poonawalla doubted a cocktail of Covishield and Covaxin and said the efficacy of this approach has not been proven in field trials involving thousands of participants.A recent study of the Indian Council of Medical Research has revealed that those who were mistakenly administered by one dose of Covishield and another dose of Covaxin reported no adverse impact. In fact, their antibody response was higher than those who were given two doses of the same vaccine.According to experts, as scientific research on the scope and possibilities of Covid vaccine is an evolving area, there is no hard and fast rule unless tried. Theoratically, the mixing of Covishield and Covaxin is possible, experts said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-if-covishield-and-covaxin-mix-fails-cyrus-poonawalla-presents-2-scenarios-101628866066568.html
13-08-2021||India||BJD to reserve 27% of tickets for backward castes in 2022 panchayat polls||The Biju Janata Dal in Odisha on Friday may have become the first party in the country to announce reservation for OBCs in polls by announcing that it would give at least 27 per cent of its tickets to OBC candidates in the three-tier panchayat polls scheduled to be held in early 2022.Food supplies minister and senior BJD leader Ranendra Pratap Swain said BJD president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik has decided to give 27 per cent of party tickets to OBCs/SEBCs starting with panchayat polls next year.“It is a historic day for the people of Odisha as the ruling BJD has decided to reserve 27% of party tickets for socially and educationally backward candidates in all elections. Due to the cap on the percentage of reservation and as there is no central law to determine it, the BJD has taken a political decision to field 27 per cent OBC/SEBC candidates in panchayat and subsequent polls in the state,” said Swain, who himself is a backward caste leader. Another backward caste leader and state agriculture minister Arun Sahoo asked the BJP and Congress to follow suit if they really cared for this neglected population.Panchayat polls are scheduled to be held in February next year and would determine the growth or decline of main opposition party BJP since it recorded a major rise in Zilla Parishad seats edging out Congress as the principal opposition party. Of the 851 Zilla Parishad seats that went to polls in 2017, BJP with 33 per cent vote share won 297 seats, which was 9 times its number of 2012. Zilla Parishads are the only tier of the Panchayati Raj system where elections are held on party symbols while the other two - Panchayat Samiti and Gram Panchayat - are fought at individual level, albeit with tacit support of one or other political parties.The BJD’s decision to give 27 per cent of the seats in panchayat polls for OBCs came two days after it demanded a central law empowering states to do away with the 50 per cent cap on the reservation and appropriate columns in the Census 2021 form for the identification of SEBCs. The party had argued that the Supreme Court and the various high courts have struck down quota for OBCs on the ground that the policies were made without any scientific database on their population.In February this year, it got the Odisha State Backward Classes (Amendment) Bill passed in the state assembly enabling the Backward Class Commission survey of the social and economic conditions of the backward classes in the state. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik who tabled the Bill said it was important to have reliable data about the Backward Classes of the state as the last census was done in 1931 which is not enough for accurate and focused planning to reach out to the backward classes of the society.Opposition BJP was swift to criticise BJD’s attempt at stirring the pot of OBC politics asking why the party was not taking the difficult step of implementing 27 per cent reservation for them in education and employment. “While many states have been providing 27 per cent reservation to OBCs, only 11.25 per cent of these categories of people are availing the benefit in government jobs in Odisha but not in education,” said BJP spokesperson Sonali Sahu.Former Union minister Srikant Jena, who himself is a backward caste leader said Patnaik was making a virtue out of necessity. “As OBCs account for 54% of Odisha’s population, they are already contesting more than 27 per cent of the seats in the panchayat polls by virtue of their majority. In the last panchayat election, at least 35 per cent of the contesting candidates in Zilla Parishad polls were from backward castes. If he really wanted to help OBCs he could have announced 27 per cent reservation for them in government jobs. Instead of doing that he has tricked everyone,” alleged Jena.Though caste has never been a factor in Odisha’s politics unlike Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan or Karnataka, BJD’s stirring the OBC pot may have been triggered by fears of opposition BJP trying to target them ahead of next year’s panchayat polls. Senior BJP leader and Union petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan, himself an OBC, earlier this year wrote a letter to Patnaik urging him to reserve seats for students belonging to the OBC category and the socially and economically backward classes. In the last Lok Sabha election, BJP stressed on PM Modi’s OBC roots.Many say Patnaik’s action is to prevent consolidation of Paikas or Khandayats (a militia caste) behind the BJP as a result of the party’s efforts in the last few years through several events including the 200th anniversary of the famous Paika rebellion against the British and a memorial for the fallen Paikas on the foothills of a mountain near Bhubaneswar. Khandayats are the martial race of Odisha who are also numerically superior with 22 per cent population. Though they figure in Odisha’s list of SEBCs, they are not in the central list of OBCs and hence excluded from any reservation.BJD leaders, however, said they had little room for maneouvering after the Orissa High Court in 2017 quashed the Odisha Reservation of Posts and Services for (Socially and Educationally Backward Classes) Act that sought to reserve 27 per cent of the seats in government services for SEBC. The state government then reduced the reservation in government seats to 11.25% to keep it under 50 per cent as per the Supreme Court judgement in the 1993 case of Indra Sawhney vs Union of India which said that the total number of reserved seats/places/positions cannot exceed 50% of what is available.The Naveen Patnaik government in 2012 panchayat polls had reserved 50 per cent of the seats in Panchayati Raj bodies. Ahead of the 2019 General Election, the BJD had given 33 per cent of Lok Sabha tickets to women candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjd-to-reserve-27-of-tickets-for-backward-castes-in-2022-panchayat-polls-101628863854202.html
13-08-2021||India||‘Wasn't supposed to say’: Serum chief praises PM Modi, says no ‘maska polish’||As Serum Institute of India's chairman Dr Cyrus Poonawalla, father of CEO Adar Poonawall, received the Lokmanya Tilak National Award, he heaped praises on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that life was not easy for vaccine makers as he had to "fall at the feet" of bureaucrats and drug controllers to get permission for vaccine launch.Using the word 'maska polish', which refers to appeasing officers in charge, Poonawalla on Friday said the reason why Serum's Covishield was launched so quickly was that there was no need for 'maska polish'. The drug controller responds even after office hours, in the evening, the senior Poonawalla said.Pune's Serum Institute of India is the world's largest vaccine maker by the volume of doses it produces every year. It is one of the main contributors to vaccines against Covid-19 not only in India but also in the world.Cyrus Poonawalla was the 6th richest man on the Forbes list of India's Richest 2020. He was also listed on Forbes' Billionaires 2021 list. The senior Poonwalla, son of a horse breeder, founded the Serum Institute of India in 1966. Taking a journey down memory lane, he said the industry was a different place at that time and he faced a lot of hardships in getting basic facilities like power, water, permission from bureaucrats."I was not supposed to say this," he said and added, "Transport and communication were also great problems and challenges that were faced by my staff and fellow directors...It was a long journey and a very painful one, which has now become very rewarding. I had to fall at the feet of bureaucrats and drug controllers, etc, to get permission. But I must stress that difficulties, red tape are much reduced now under the Modi government."Cyrus Poonawalla dedicated the award to his late wife Villoo and said that he has received numerous awards in the United States, the United Kingdom, but the Lokmanya Tilak award is very special to him.While the pandemic and Covishield made Serum a household name, the company for years has been producing vaccines for Polio, Diptheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Hib, BCG, r-Hepatitis B, Measles, Mumps and Rubella etc. Adar Poonawalla, the present CEO of the company, has major plans to extend the company and has invested millions to build new units.The company has received all kinds of support from the government for Covishield vaccine and the other Covid vaccines that the company is now working on. The Union home ministry also provided Y category security cover to Adar Poonawalla, after he claimed he received threats for vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wasnt-supposed-to-say-serum-chief-praises-pm-modi-says-no-maska-polish-101628862570692.html

The firm further said it was entering into an agreement with Enso Healthcare DMCC (Enso), a company incorporated in Dubai.In a statement, Wockhardt said that it will “manufacture and supply to Enso up to 620 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine and the Sputnik Light vaccine” against coronavirus. According to a Livemint report, the pharma company said the development came following required approvals from agencies concerned as well as “successful technology transfer from HV to the company.”This development came a week after an Indian pharma firm, Panacea Biotec Limited, said it will produce up to 25 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine using the drug substance manufactured by Russia’s Generium. The company will then supply the vaccines to drugmaker Dr Reddy’s Laboratories for distribution in India, the Livemint report added.Quoting Russian envoy Nikolay Kudashev, news agency ANI had reported in July the single-dose Sputnik Light Covid-19 vaccine is likely to be launched in India soon. As far as Sputnik V is concerned, the RDIF had said the vaccine’s production in the country is expected to “come fully on stream” in September. Earlier this month, Dr Reddy’s said it had received “31.5 lakh doses of component 1 and 4.5 lakh doses of component 2 of the Sputnik V vaccine in India”. “We are working closely with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to ramp up supplies. We are also working closely with our partners in India for manufacturing readiness,” ANI reported citing a statement by the company.Dr Reddy’s further said locally manufactured Sputnik V vaccines against Covid-19 are likely to be rolled-out in India within September or October.Also Read | India-made Sputnik V Covid vaccine may be available from September: Dr Reddy’sThe RDIF partnered with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories to market the first 250 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine in India. The Russian agency has also joined hands with the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) among many other pharmaceutical firms for the manufacture of the anti-coronavirus vaccine. The SII will produce more than 300 million doses of Sputnik V annually starting this year itself.The soft launch rollout of the Sputnik V vaccine began in Hyderabad on May 14, and since then it has spread to several major Indian cities, including Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, and Lucknow, among others.The Sputnik V vaccine is a two-dose shot, but unlike other Covid-19 vaccines that also have two-jabs, the two doses of the Russian vaccine are not identical. It has been found to be 91.6 per cent effective against Covid-19 as per its third phase clinical trials. Sputnik Light is the first component of the Sputnik V vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-rdif-partners-with-wockhardt-to-produce-supply-sputnik-v-vaccines-101628861779267.html

The police asked him to appear before the police in person on June 24 at the Loni border police station, following which he moved the Karnataka High Court regarding the notice. However, the HC, in its order a month later on July 23, quashed the notice but allowed the police to question Maheshwari virtually at his office or at his residence in Bengaluru. The court had earlier also restrained the police from taking any coercive action on the case. The Ghaziabad police had booked Maheshwari along with Twitter, Twitter India, a few journalists and some Congress leaders regarding the case, alleging that video was shared widely to cause communal unrest.In a separate incident, Maheshwari was also booked by the UP Police over the depiction of a wrong map of India. The company had also faced continuous pressure from the government over compliance with the new IT rules. However, the government told the Delhi High Court on August 10 that Twitter was “prima facie” in compliance with the rules by appointing a chief compliance officer (CCO), resident grievance officer (RGO) and nodal contact person on permanent basis. More recently, the company was again on the news after the handles of several Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi’s, were blocked for sharing a picture of Gandhi meeting with the family of a minor rape victim in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-india-head-manish-maheshwari-moves-to-new-us-based-role-101628859556653.html

The bill was passed amid din.Kareem has refuted the allegations of manhandling a marshal in the Rajya Sabha and said interim the report was created to counter the Opposition's complaint to the Rajya Sabha chairman and the media. "This is a fabricated story to escape from what they have done," said Kareem.Later, Kareem took to Twitter and hit out at the Narendra Modi government for passing bills without discussion. “Passing of key Bills without discussion & vote is unacceptable. Heavy deployment of marshals during (the tabling and passage of) Insurance Bill, the way they assaulted even women MPs & how they pursue false charges indicate the heights of strangling our Parliamentary democracy. We'll continue our struggle,” he wrote.Functioning of both Houses of Parliament during the monsoon session was majorly affected by frequent disruptions with both sides refusing to budge from their stand. While the government has blamed the Opposition for the din, the latter has slammed the ruling camp for refusing to hold debates on issues like the Pegasus controversy and farm laws and suppressing its voice in Parliament, besides passing bills without any discussions.Both Houses of Parliament were adjourned sine die on Wednesday, two days before the scheduled end of the session.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpim-mp-elemaram-kareem-seeks-probe-amid-blame-game-over-rajya-sabha-clashes-101628861104122.html

The adenoviral intranasal vaccine BBV154 is the first of its kind Covid-19 jab to undergo human trials in India. The Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers of age groups ranging from 18 to 60 years was well tolerated, according to the ministry of science and technology.The ministry said the intranasal vaccine was found to be safe, immunogenic and well-tolerated in the preclinical toxicity studies and was able to elicit high levels of neutralizing antibodies in animal studies. It has received approval to conduct Phase 2 randomised clinical trial of “heterologus prime-boost combination of Sars-CoV-2 vaccines to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Covaxin with BBV154...in healthy volunteers.”The development of Bharat Biotech’s intranasal vaccine has been supported by the department of biotechnology (DBT) and Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC). They strategised to fast-track research and development efforts, especially for vaccine development, diagnostics, drug repurposing, therapeutics and testing.“The department through Mission Covid Suraksha, is committed to development of safe and efficacious Covid-19 vaccines.

13-08-2021||India||Erratic rains linked to climate crisis shift sowing patterns||Erratic rainfall this summer, thought to be linked to climate change, upended sowing patterns in many states, keeping farmers on tenterhooks as rains tapered off around the end of June before reviving in late July, several cultivators have said. Even after accelerating towards mid-July, the monsoon rains were 7% deficient on August 13 for the season as a whole. Some farmers, especially in Gujarat, said lack of rains for a considerable period meant growers were pushed into a guessing game on what to sow. Another in Haryana said he expected poorer yields from cotton. A third farmer in Madhya Pradesh said he had nearly given up on his soya crop until the rains revived. The June-September monsoon, which waters nearly 60% of the country’s net-sown area, had stalled towards June-end and then dumped excess rainfall after reviving in mid-July in a pattern scientists say is consistent with a changing climate. According to climatologists, longer dry spell and short spurts of heavy rainfall are tell-tale signs of a changing monsoon owing to the impacts of a warming planet. The India Meteorological Department has forecast a normal monsoon for 2021. The monsoon has been quite uneven, data from the India Meteorological Department show. Gujarat, which accounts for 40% and 20% of groundnut and cotton acreage, has faced a cumulative rainfall deficit of 43%. “With Indian agriculture largely rainfall-dependent, the now-on, now-off monsoon this year has shifted the sowing from much-expected oilseeds (groundnut and soybean) to maize and paddy for kharif,” said Hetal Gandhi, director of Crisil Research Ltd. According to reports, the shortfall from June 1 to August 8 prompted Gujarat farmers to shift from groundnut and cotton to castor, a hardier crop that can withstand dry weather. “We were guessing all the time. After sowing a crop and spending so much, you can’t invest again to replace it. So, ultimately many in our village decided to sow castor instead of groundnut,” Chabil Patel, a potato and groundnut farmer in Sabarkantha said over the phone. To the east in Odisha, cumulative rainfall deficit has been around 8%. The state accounts for 8% of the country’s total paddy acreage While north-eastern states, such as Assam faced drought in its paddy and tea growing belt, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Haryana received excessive rainfall. East Rajasthan and north Madhya Pradesh were deluged by a violent surge in the monsoon. “I am not very confident of what my yields will be. There will be damage due to excess rains,” said soy grower Ravikant Moria, a farmer in Mandsaur, Maharashtra. Madhya Pradesh faced a severe dry spell between mid-June to mid-July, shrinking soybean and urad acreage by 11% and 5% year-on-year until August 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/erratic-rains-linked-to-climate-crisis-shift-sowing-patterns-101628859235462.html

Party national general secretary and former Uttarakhand chief minister Rawat, who is the president of the election campaign committee for the 2022 polls, made the statement in a Facebook post as well as in an interview with a Hindi daily. Rawat in his latest remark had said that the party’s doors are open for “anyone willing to join it but after proper analysis”. “There are some leaders in the ruling BJP who are unhappy with the leadership and think they are not getting what they deserve there. Many of them are in touch with us which we won’t deny. Our doors are open for them except some who think they are too smart,” said Rawat without naming any BJP leader. Earlier before Rawat’s statement, the party leadership including state president Ganesh Godiyal had also hinted at something similar. Reacting to the statement by Rawat to whom he is reportedly close, Godiyal said, “He is a very senior and experienced leader of our party. If he is saying something, then there must be some reason behind it.” “About a month ago, when the BJP appointed Pushkar Singh Dhami as the new chief minister, the discontent among some of the leaders in BJP had come out in the open when senior leaders and cabinet ministers Satpal Maharaj and Harak Singh Rawat were clearly unhappy with the decision. There were even reports that a day after Dhami’s appointment, Maharaj and Rawat held a meeting following which other senior leaders had to pacify them. That fire hasn’t been doused yet,” said Godiyal. He, however added, “If anyone is willing to join the Congress from BJP, then the decision will be taken by the party leadership after proper analysis.Maharaj and Rawat had defected to the BJP from Congress in 2016 along with Subodh Uniyal, Rekha Arya and Yashpal Arya. All of them are cabinet ministers in the present BJP government. The state BJP leadership, however, refuted the claims of the Congress calling it a “bluff”.“It is just ridiculous that Congress which is in an existential crisis is claiming that our leaders are in touch with them. It has been already rejected by the people and is now a sinking ship. Which leader will like to jump in? All our leaders are united and determined to win the 2022 polls with a thumping majority by crossing the tally of 60 out of 70 seats,” said Vipin Kainthola, BJP state spokesperson. On the latest development, political analyst MM Semwal said that it is “more of a mind game ahead of the next elections”. “It is well known that Congress defectors including Satpal Maharaj and Harak Singh Rawat are not free in BJP as they were in Congress. But I don’t think they would be in touch with Harish Rawat. Apart from them, no other defector seems to be that unhappy in BJP,” Semwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leaders-sending-feelers-says-harish-rawat-ahead-of-2022-uttarakhand-assembly-polls-101628857074145.html

He has a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) degree that he completed from the Gangoh village in Saharanpur and his father was a farmer, according to the police.However, the ECI has said that its database is "absolutely safe and secure," following the incident. "A data entry operator of one of the AERO (assistant electoral roll officers) offices had illegally shared his user ID and password with a private unauthorised service provider in Saharanpur's Nakud town to print some voter ID cards. Both these persons have been arrested," PTI quoted an ECI spokesperson.Also read | Noida to get 350-acre medical device park, provide employment to 20,000 people: UP govtFollowing the initial investigation, the police found that Saini had created more than 10,000 fake voter IDs over a time of three months, at the behest of a person named Armaan Malik from Madhya Pradesh. S Channappa, senior superintendent of police, Saharanpur, said that an amount of ₹100 to ₹200 per fake voter ID was paid to him, according to the PTI report. Also, on further examination of the bank account following Saini’s arrest, a sum of ₹60 lakh was found deposited in it, after which the account was immediately blocked. The police have seized two computers from Saini’s home and are also trying to find the source of the money and more details about Malik.Meanwhile, Saini had told the police that Malik used to send him the details about each day’s work. Further, the police also said that the authorities in Delhi would now seek the court’s permission to take Saini to the national capital for further investigation about the matter. He would be questioned about possible links with anti-national or terrorist forces, PTI further reported, citing the police.Former chief minister of UP and leader of the Samajwadi Party (SP) Akhilesh Yadav said that the scam should be investigated to know if it gets any state protection. “The news of a youth making a fake voter ID card by 'digital burglary' on the website of the UP Election Commission is very serious. There should be an investigation in the entire state for such scams, to know whether it is getting state shelter. It is not only a question of security of the Election Commission but also of dignity,” he tweeted on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/24yearold-arrested-from-saharanpur-for-creating-fake-voter-ids-by-hacking-into-eci-website-say-police-101628855681599.html

13-08-2021||India||Vehicle scrappage policy catalyst for change: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday formally launched the National Automobile Scrappage Policy and said it would provide a “new identity” for the automobiles sector, create job opportunities, prove beneficial for the common man, and help reduce India’s carbon footprint. The Prime Minister was virtually addressing an investors’ summit in Gujarat where the policy was launched in the presence of union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, who piloted the policy in Parliament earlier this year, and Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani.Modi also pitched the policy as a facilitator for Asia’s largest shipbreaking yard in Gujarat’s Bhavnagar to diversify into a vehicle scrapping hub. At least half a dozen investment MoUs were also signed at the summit in Gandhinagar. Also Read | UNSC: Reading India’s global signals rightThe Prime Minister called it a “waste-to-wealth mission” and went on to say that the implementation of the policy “will reduce pollution”. “The policy will bring investments worth more than ₹10,000 crore and, in the process, create employment opportunities for thousands of youngsters,” he said.The scrappage policy would have a catalytic effect on all sectors, he said. By helping remove unfit vehicles from roads and thus cutting emissions as well as reducing road accidents, the new policy is the Centre’s commitment to provide “clean, congestion-free and convenient mobility in the 21st century”, he said.Under the policy, those who give their old vehicle for scrap will be given a certificate. People with this certificate will not be charged any registration fee on the purchase of a new vehicle, said the PM, adding that such people will also be entitled for some rebate on road tax.He explained that a vehicle would not be scrapped merely because it was old. “Fitness tests will be conducted at scrappage centres, and only after that will it be scrapped, that too, applying scientific methods,” he said.Speaking on the occasion, Nitin Gadkari said, “With regular scrapping of (old and dilapidated vehicles), close to 99% of metal waste can be recovered. This will, in effect, bring down the cost of raw material by approximately 40%.” Among key benefits, Gadkari pointed out that this would make components less expensive and help global competitiveness. He added that, “With the increase in automobile sales, the government will earn ₹30,000 crore to ₹40,000 crore from GST (Goods and Services Tax),” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vehicle-scrappage-policy-catalyst-for-change-pm-modi-101628853653753.html

The elusive hyena was spotted in camera trap images set up to monitor the movement of wild animals and poachers in the park. “Hyenas are already in the park but they were spotted in the camera trap after five years. The last time, they were caught on camera was in Kalagarh in 2017. A scheme is underway for their protection in the park and their census is due in the month of October,” said Rahul (who goes by his first name), Director, Corbett National Park on Friday. Rahul said hyenas used to be in the park in ample numbers but later their numbers dipped as the number of tigers and leopards rose in the park. Forest officials feel that spotting hyenas after five years is a good sign for the park. “Hyenas have been spotted in Kalagarh, Sona river area and other areas and it is a good sign for the park. These are found across the country especially in sanctuaries,” said Rahul. The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), listed by the IUCN as near-threatened, is primarily a scavenger, but large hyenas are known to kill their prey. They are nocturnal and return to their lair before sunrise, which is why they are rarely sighted. The Corbett Tiger Reserve, which is spread across 1,288 square km, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the state. The gates of the park open on November 15 every year for six months till mid-June. Corbett witnesses a footfall of around 300,000 tourists every year. There are 231 tigers inside CTR and 266 are using the reserve according to the latest report on tigers. This is the highest number of tigers across 50 tiger reserves in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/striped-hyena-spotted-after-5-years-in-corbett-tiger-reserve-101628853113682.html

He is the third person to die of this variant in Maharashtra. An 80-year-old woman from Ratnagiri was the first person in the state to succumb to the variant followed by a 63-year-old woman from Mumbai. Delta Plus, a mutation of the highly transmissible Delta variant, was detected in Maharashtra during the second Covid-19 wave. In June, the Union health ministry declared it as the variant of concern.The journalist suffered from multiple co-morbidities and was admitted to the civil hospital for nearly 17 days. He died on July 22.Civil surgeon Suhas Mane said the patient was fully vaccinated in May.This is Maharashtra’s third fatality linked to the Delta Plus variant- Maharashtra has recorded 65 cases of the Delta Plus variant. Each district has been mandated to send 100 samples of Covid-19 patients every month for genome sequencing for its detection. The journalist’s sample was among those sent from Raigad in July.A 44-year-old teacher from Uran was also found to have been infected with the Delta Plus variant after getting fully vaccinated. She recovered without any complications. During the contact tracing exercise, the Raigad health officials found four family members of the journalist and five close contacts of the teacher were infected with Covid-19. “We have sent their samples for genome sequencing.

13-08-2021||India||No time for meet on caste census, Tejashwi says PM Modi insulted CM Nitish||Leader of Opposition in Bihar Assembly and Rashtriya Janata Party (RJD) Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Friday said it was an insult of chief minister Nitish Kumar if he had not been granted time by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the issue of a caste-based census. He said Kumar had assured the Opposition parties of seeking a meeting with the PM over the issue and is said to have written to Modi on August 4, but is yet to hear from the latter.“If he has not been granted time for a week now, somehow it is an insult to the CM,” the RJD leader was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Earlier in the day, Yadav wrote to Modi and sought an appointment for the elected leaders from Bihar to discuss the contentious issue of the caste-wise census in the state. If the Centre fails to meet the Bihar parties’ demand, Yadav said, “We will be left with no option but to sit on dharna at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi.”On Thursday, Kumar said he was yet to receive any response to his letter, received by the Prime Minister's Office on August 4, requesting a meeting with Modi to discuss the issue. "The demand of the caste census is not just the demand from Bihar but other states also. Our party MPs had written a letter seeking time to meet the Prime Minister. The opposition parties in Bihar also wanted to meet the Prime Minister with us. We had written a letter to the Prime Minister regarding this," Kumar said."The letter was received at PMO on August 4. We have not received any reply from the Prime Minister's office yet. We want a caste-based Census and it is our long-standing demand. A caste-based Census will help all castes to get their exact numbers so that policies can be made accordingly. Caste census is in the interest of all. It is for the benefit of the country. It is the job of the central government to take a decision regarding the caste census. If the Prime Minister gives time, we will definitely discuss the issue. It is not a political issue but a social one," added Kumar.According to an NDTV report, Yadav said Kumar seemed to have been ignored by the Centre as the PM’s Twitter handle revealed he was meeting several other dignitaries. "When we look at the Prime Minister's Twitter handle, it seems he has time to meet others, but if he is not able to meet Nitish Kumar and a delegation of the entire leadership of Bihar Assembly on such an important issue...Can't say much, but he should have made time by now," he said, even as he wondered why the PM was ignoring the issue. The Bihat assembly has unanimously passed a resolution in favour of a caste-wise census twice in the past."Since both (Centre and Bihar) have NDA governments...we, the Opposition leaders of Bihar Assembly, without any bias, went and met the respected Chief Minister in his chambers. We said, ‘you seek some time (with the PM) and we will go and meet him’," Yadav was quoted as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-time-for-meet-on-caste-census-tejashwi-says-pm-modi-insulted-cm-nitish-101628849330781.html

The injured person has been admitted to a hospital in Begusarai and his condition is believed to be critical. Additional police forces have been sent to the site of the incident. Search parties were also sent out but the criminals managed to escape. The house allegedly belonged to a man called Dasrath Singh.Soon after the incident, police teams and administrative officials including Khagaria SP Amitesh Kumar as well as the district magistrate reached the spot. The police have started investigating the matter and believe that a land dispute probably led to the crime. According to the locals, when the men posing as police personnel knocked on the door of the house, a few family members came out and opened the door. As soon as they opened the door, the men began firing. “Dhananjay Singh (63) and Bijendra alias Bijay Singh (60) died on the spot, while their younger brother Pappu Singh suffered injuries last night when armed criminals dressed as police attacked Dasrath’s house,” SHO of Beldaur police station Achhe Lal Paswan said adding that eyewitnesses told him that nearly a dozen armed men dressed in police uniform fired at the family members. He also said that the villagers were not able to identify the men.Khagaria SP Amitesh Kumar told HT that preliminary investigation suggested that the reason behind the incident was probably a land dispute between the victims and their neighbour Pampam Singh. “We are probing the incident from all angles and the exact number of people involved in the murder will become clearer after inquiry,” he said.A case has been registered at the local police station and raids are being carried out to nab the culprits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-killed-1-hurt-as-armed-men-posing-as-police-open-fire-in-bihar-s-khagaria-101628849993671.html

The findings of the second state serosurvey pertain to the beginning of the year, but the data might help epidemiologists to chart out the future course of action amid the threat of a third wave.Here are the top 10 findings of the Karnataka serosurvey1. Belagavi, Chamarajanagar, Mandya, Kodagu, Bagalkot Vijayapura, Ramanagara, Mysuru, Chitradurga reported a high transmission ratio.2. Mysuru reported the highest seroprevalence, followed by Madhya, Kodagu, Chamarajanagar and Kolar.Also Read: Around 250 cases in 5 days: Bengaluru sees spike of Covid cases among youth, children3. Before the second wave struck, at least 1 in 6 people had Covid antibodies as the second serosurvey has found 15.6 per cent seroprevalence in the state. 2. The study found Lower levels of IgG seroprevalence, mostly due to antibody waning.3. A substudy was done to confirm the antibody waning. This study was delayed due to rapid surge of cases in April. 4. We found near 0 prevalence of active cases during mid-February 2021.2/n 4. People between the age of 50 and 59 had the highest protection against Covid In January-February. The lowest protection was observed among people between the ages of 18 years and 29 years.5. At that time, Karnataka was far from attaining herd immunity or natural immunity.6. The serosurvey addressed the issue of antibody waning which is the drop in natural antibodies with time. Candidates who took part in the first serosurvey were also called in the second one and it was found that half of them, who earlier had antibodies, lost these antibodies in the intervening gap of three months.7. The study finds a near-0 prevalence of active cases during mid-February 2021, just before the second wave struck the state and the country.8. The subsequent surge in Covid cases in Karnataka in April was due to a "mix of alpha, delta, and a huge susceptible population", Dr Giridhara R Babu, state advisory committee member, said.9. The national serosurvey conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research found that Karnataka has 69.8 per cent seroprevalence. 10. This all-India survey was done during the second wave of the pandemic.

Our country is a peace-loving nation but we faced some situations and we had to train our forces for war.”The Indian Army and various other organisations under the ministry of defence are organising various programmes across the nation to mark the 75th anniversary of India's Independence, reports news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-launches-various-events-to-mark-independence-day-101628833877868.html
13-08-2021||India||Kerala high court grants bail to 4 in ISRO spy case||The Kerala high court on Friday granted anticipatory bail to four former police and intelligence officers in the case related to the alleged framing of former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist Nambi Narayanan in a 1994 espionage case.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in June booked former Intelligence Bureau (IB) deputy director RB Sreekumar and 16 other police personnel over the alleged conspiracy to frame Narayanan.A single bench of Justice Ashok Menon granted the bail to former Kerala police officers S Vijayan, Durgadutt as well as Sreekumar, and another former IB official S Jayaprakash. The CBI and two Maldivian women, who were also implicated in the case, opposed their bail pleas.Also Read | Cardinal must face trial in land deal matter: Kerala HCAdditional solicitor general SV Raju, who appeared for the CBI, told the high court that it was a serious case and some foreign agencies, including Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence, were involved in the conspiracy to sabotage the country’s cryogenic project that Narayanan was a part of in the 1990s.The court asked the agency to produce evidence in this regard. The CBI said it will produce the proof when the case progresses.The 16 were booked two months after the Supreme Court in April ordered the CBI to investigate the conspiracy behind the framing. It called the matter “serious” and said it requires “deeper investigation” into the role of the officers responsible. The top court accepted the report of a committee it constituted in 2018 to probe the circumstances that led to the alleged framing.Narayanan, 79, was arrested in 1994 in the alleged espionage case. He was exonerated two years later following a CBI closure report. The former police and intelligence personnel have been charged with conspiracy, framing of false evidence, and illegal custody.Narayanan has said the country suffered badly due to the case and the cryogenic project of ISRO was delayed because of itHe was arrested after his numbers were found in a diary recovered from the two Maldivian women arrested in 1994 on charges of overstaying in the country. Narayanan was later charged with espionage before he was acquitted in 1995 after a CBI inquiry. The Supreme Court ordered compensation for Narayanan and constituted the committee that recommended a central agency probe into the conspiracy angle.Sreekumar was on deputation with the IB when the case surfaced. He has maintained he had no role in the case and he never met or interrogated Narayanan. Some of the accused said they were not heard by the Supreme Court-appointed Jain Commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-grants-bail-to-4-in-isro-spy-case-101628842552245.html

13-08-2021||India||High Covid case count in dists with tourist spots cause for concern in Bengal||West Bengal is recording a high daily count of Covid-19 cases in districts with popular tourist destinations, leading to the speculation that tourism could be causing the spike, even as the overall daily count of the state is hovering between 600 and 800. Prominent among the districts where Covid cases have been found to be on the higher side, are Darjeeling and Purba Medinipur. While Darjeeling is a popular hill station in north Bengal, tourists flock to the sea beaches of Digha and Mandarmani in Purba Medinipur. “The number of cases in districts such as Darjeeling and Purba Medinipur is on the higher side. This could be because of tourists. Even though local trains continue to remain suspended, long distance trains and buses are plying,” said an official.The number of cases in Kolkata and its adjoining districts such as North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly has always been higher than the rest of the districts. While districts like Purulia, Jhargram, Murshidabad, Uttar Dinajpur, Dakshin Dinajpur reported not more than 15 cases on Thursday, Darjeeling and Purba Medinipur recorded 74 and 48 cases. Kolkata, North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas recorded 77, 88 and 68 cases respectively. “The higher number of cases in Darjeeling could also be because it includes Siliguri which is a trading hub in north Bengal,” said another official. “The district administrations have already taken some strict measures to restrict the flow of tourists. Tourists are not being allowed without a Covid-negative RT-PCR test report or vaccination certificate in several districts, including Purba Medinipur, Darjeeling, Birbhum and South 24 Parganas,” said a senior official of the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-covid-case-count-in-dists-with-tourist-spots-cause-for-concern-in-bengal-101628838591874.html

This comes after the Maharashtra health department on Wednesday said that cases of Delta Plus variant have reached 65 in the state.One death was reported in the Raigad district on Friday due to the Delta Plus variant. The deceased was a 69-year-old man in the Nagothane area of the district, Raigad collector Nidhi Chaudhary was cited as saying news agency ANI.According to the civic body, Mumbai has recorded its first death due to the Delta Plus variant with a 63-year-old fully vaccinated woman succumbing to it in July. The woman had several comorbidities, including diabetes. She was one of seven patients in the city who recently tested positive for the Delta Plus variant, according to initial information provided by the civic health officials.Last month, an 80-year-old woman from Maharashtra's Ratnagiri district became the first Covid-19 patient in the state to succumb to the Delta Plus variant.What do we know so far about the Delta Plus variant?1. The Delta Plus (AY.1) is a mutation of the highly transmissible Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2). It was detected in Maharashtra during the second wave of coronavirus. The Union health ministry declared it as a variant of concern in July.2. Amid growing cases of Delta Plus in Maharashtra, which currently stands at 65, medical experts have stressed the need to ramp up the Covid-19 vaccination process.3. Suchitra Ella, joint managing director of Bharat Biotech, on Thursday said that Covaxin has shown 65 per cent efficacy against the B.1.617.2 or the Delta variant. “Supplied 75 million doses of Covaxin, more to be supplied in August. Our vaccine has 65 per cent efficacy against Delta. Our second site is at its Ankleshwar-based manufacturing plant. Sample batches are ready, it will go to CDL Kasauli this month for quality testing,” news agency ANI quoted Ella as saying.4. Dr Lancelot Pinto, epidemiologist and pulmonologist of Hinduja Hospital, has said the Delta Plus variant, in addition to having mutations seen in the Delta variant that renders it potentially more transmissible than the Alpha variant. “What experience from across the world has consistently shown us is that when rates of vaccination are high, even if variants cause surges in infections, such infections tend to be of a milder nature and do not cause hospitalisations or deaths on a large scale. We also need to do our best to limit crowds, as overcrowding has consistently led to spread over the past 18 months,” said Dr Pinto.5. The Maharashtra government has said that out of the newly detected cases of the Delta Plus variant, seven were in Mumbai, three in Pune, two each in Nanded, Gondia, Raigad, Palghar, and one each in Chandrapur and Akola districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-deaths-in-maharashtra-due-to-delta-plus-variant-what-we-know-so-far-101628836292909.html

13-08-2021||India||India joins other nations to assert govt forced on Afghanistan won’t be recognised||India has joined Germany, Qatar and Turkey in calling for an immediate ceasefire in Afghanistan and asserting that any government imposed by military force in Kabul will not be recognised. A statement issued by Qatar following a meeting of special envoys and representatives of India, Germany, Norway, Qatar, Tajikistan, Turkey and Turkmenistan in Doha on Thursday also highlighted the urgent need to accelerate the process to find a negotiated settlement in Afghanistan. The Taliban captured Kandahar and Herat, Afghanistan’s second and third largest cities, and the strategic provincial capital of Ghazni on Thursday, increasing the pressure on the beleaguered government in Kabul weeks before the US completes the drawdown of its troops. The Taliban have so far taken 12 out of 34 provincial capitals and the capture of Ghazni has cut off the highway between Kabul and the southern city of Kandahar. Also Read | Kabul in Taliban’s cross-hairs make Doha peace talks redundantThe statement from Qatar’s foreign ministry said two separate meetings on Afghanistan – one joined by the representatives of China, Uzbekistan, the US, Pakistan, the UK, Qatar, the UN and the European Union on August 10, and another of the representatives of Germany, India, Norway, Qatar, Tajikistan, Turkey and Turkmenistan on August 12 – had agreed that the participants “will not recognize any government in Afghanistan that is imposed through the use of military force”. The countries also agreed on the need to accelerate the Afghan peace process as a “very urgent and essential issue for negotiating concrete proposals from both sides”. The participants urged the Taliban and the Afghan government to “build trust and accelerate efforts to reach a political settlement and comprehensive ceasefire as quickly as possible”, and to stop “violence and attacks immediately in and against provincial capitals and other cities”. The countries also noted “converging statements” from both sides on certain principles for a political settlement, such as inclusive governance, respect for human rights, including the rights of women and minorities, a mechanism to deliver a representative government, a commitment to not allow any individuals or groups to use Afghan soil to threaten the security of other countries, respect for international law. The meeting also expressed “grave concerns” about reports from across Afghanistan regarding continued violence, high civilian casualties and extra-judicial killings, widespread and credible allegations of human rights violations, and the destruction of physical infrastructure that perpetuate conflict and make reconciliation efforts more difficult. As part of desperate efforts to counter the Taliban’s advance, UN Security Council members Estonia and Norway drafted a statement to condemn the group’s attacks on cities and towns that have resulted in high civilian casualties. According to Reuters, the draft statement, which is being discussed by Security Council members and has to be agreed by consensus by the 15-member body, also threatens sanctions for abuses and acts that risk Afghanistan’s peace and stability. The text also “strongly affirms that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is not recognised at the United Nations and declares that it does not and will not support the establishment of any government in Afghanistan imposed through military force or restoration of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan”. This is largely in line with the position taken by India, which holds the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council for August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-joins-other-nations-to-assert-government-forced-on-af-won-t-be-recognised-101628837031724.html
13-08-2021||India||‘Significant milestone towards Aatmanirbhar Bharat’: PM Modi launches National Automobile Scrappage Policy||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday virtually addressed the Investor Summit in Gujarat, launching the National Automobile Scrappage Policy on the occasion. The scrappage policy, he said, is a “significant milestone” towards Aatmanirbhar Bharat.Also Read: PM Modi to address Investor Summit in Gujarat today“The scrappage policy will provide a new identity to the country's auto sector. It will play a huge role in removing unfit vehicles from roads, and bring a positive change in all sectors and not just auto sector,” Prime Minister Modi said. The central government, he explained, has taken this step as the country, in the 21st century, needs “clean, congestion-free and convenient mobility.”Describing it as a “waste-to-wealth mission,” the Prime Minister further remarked that the policy is an important part of the circular economy. “It will reduce pollution from our cities and also reflects the government's commitment towards rapid development. The policy will bring investments worth more than ₹10,000 crore and, in the process, create employment opportunities for thousands of youngsters,” he said.“In two days, we will celebrate our 75th Independence Day, but the next 25 years will also be very important as, during this period, our day-to-day lives will undergo significant changes due to technology,” PM Modi further said, adding that the government's effort is to ensure that development is “sustainable and environment-friendly.”He then listed out five ways in which the scrappage policy will be beneficial to the common man. “Firstly, a certificate will be given on scrapping of the old car, which will ensure that an individual does not have to pay registration fees while buying a new car. He will also get discount in road tax. Secondly, a person will save money on maintenance cost, repair cost and fuel efficiency of the old car,” PM Modi elaborated.The third and fourth benefits, he said, are that it will reduce road accidents and offer protection from effects from pollution, respectively. “A vehicle will not be scrapped just because it is old. Fitness tests will be conducted at scrappage centres and only after that will it be scrapped, that too, as per scientific methods,” PM Modi said, describing the fifth and final benefit.The Investor Summit has been jointly organised in Gujarat's Capital city of Gandhinagar by the Union ministry of transport and national highways and the state government. Union minister of transport Nitin Gadkari and Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani also spoke at the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/investor-summit-gujarat-pm-modi-launches-national-automobile-scrappage-policy-101628833397893.html

13-08-2021||India||Many Twitter accounts locked, Congress falls back on other online platforms||The Congress leadership has fallen back on other online platforms after nearly 5,000 Twitter accounts, including those of several senior leaders and the party’s official handle, were temporarily locked on Thursday after they shared a photograph of Rahul Gandhi meeting a minor rape victim’s family in Delhi. Gandhi’s account was locked on Saturday. The party has attacked the Union government for scuttling free speech even as Twitter maintained it “impartially” enforces its rules and terms of service.Most Congress leaders and workers have changed profile pictures and names of their Twitter handles to that of Rahul Gandhi over the locking of his profile.“They can lock us out on a platform, but they can’t lockout our voice for the sake of people,” Gandhi said in an Instagram post after his Twitter handle was locked. Gandhi added that “if fighting for justice of a rape and murder victim is a crime, then I am guilty.”He said his Twitter account was locked out because all he had done was shown empathy and compassion towards the victim of rape. “Fear not as the truth alone shall win.”A hashtag #TwitterBJPseDarGaya (Twitter is afraid of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party) also trended following the locking of Twitter handles.Congress also put out a video on its YouTube channel condemning Twitter’s action while “none in the government bothered to utter a word on the rape and murder of the Dalit minor”. The party said Gandhi could not stop himself from meeting the parents of the victim while criticising the government over its alleged inaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/many-twitter-accounts-locked-congress-falls-back-on-other-online-platforms-101628833311155.html
13-08-2021||India||Twitter is attacking democracy, interfering in political process: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday called Twitter a “biased platform” and said that the social media network is interfering in India's political process. “This is not an attack on Rahul Gandhi or simply about shutting Rahul Gandhi down. This is an attack on the democratic structure of the country,” the Congress leader said.Rahul Gandhi made the remarks in a video statement titled “Twitter's Dangerous Game”, which he posted from his official handle on YouTube. The statement comes in the wake of Twitter temporarily locking several Congress leaders out of their accounts for sharing a photograph of the family of a nine-year-old rape victim in Delhi. Accounts of Randeep Singh Surjewala, Ajay Maken, Sushmita Dev, and Manickam Tagore were among those temporarily locked, Congress functionaries aware of the matter said.“I have some 19 to 20 million followers, you are denying them the right to an opinion,” Gandhi said. “It is not only patently unfair but also breaching the idea that Twitter is a neutral platform.”Also Read | 'We challenge you': Congress to Twitter over Rahul Gandhi's locked accountThe Congress leader said that such actions by a social media platform are “very dangerous” for investors since taking sides in a political context always has repercussions. He said that at a time when India's “democracy is under attack”, Twitter is proving to be a “biased platform” which “listens to what the government of the day says”.“The democracy is under attack, we are not allowed to speak in the Parliament, the media is controlled and I thought there was a ray of light where we could put what we thought on Twitter,” Rahul Gandhi said. “But that is not the case, it is now obvious that Twitter is a biased platform and it's something that listens to what the government of the day says.”Twitter, however, insists that it enforces its rules “judiciously and impartially” and added it has taken proactive action over several hundred tweets that posted the image in violation of its rules. A spokesperson for the social media platform confirmed that “(Twitter)...may continue to do so in line with our range of enforcement options.”On its part, Twitter said that “certain types of private information carry higher risks than others” and that it was the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), which alerted the company about the specific content on the platform allegedly revealing the identity of the alleged sexual assault victim and her parents. It added the matter was reviewed in line with Twitter rules as well as the concerns expressed as per Indian law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-is-attacking-democracy-interfering-in-political-process-rahul-gandhi-101628831407033.html
13-08-2021||India||India’s renewable energy capacity crosses 100 gigawatts||India’s renewable energy capacity has crossed the milestone of 100 gigawatts (GW), the government said in a statement on Thursday. “Today India stands at 4th position in the world in terms of installed RE capacity, 5th in solar, and 4th in wind in terms of installed capacity,” the statement added.This is an important milestone given India has a power generation capacity of 383.73 GW. While the country has been resisting the pressure of declaring a net-zero emission goal and calling out nations on their carbon-neutral intent announcements, its green energy trajectory has been on an upswing.“Another landmark day in the history of the Indian Power Sector. Our installed Renewable Energy capacity (excluding large Hydro) has crossed 1,00,000 Megawatts. Under the visionary leadership of PM @narendramodi Ji, we shall continue to be global leaders in Energy Transition,” Union power and new and renewable energy minister Raj Kumar Singh said in a tweet.Also Read | India records 40,120 new Covid-19 infections, active cases fall to 385,227The statement said while 100 GW has been installed, 50 GW is under installation and 27 GW is under tendering. “India has also enhanced its ambition to install 450 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. If large hydro is included the installed RE capacity increases to 146 GW.”The government’s plans face the problem of the paucity of funds. According to a Parliamentary report released in March, India needs ₹2,61,000 crore more to fund the balance energy capacity and achieve the target of 175 GW by 2022. However, the average annual investment in this sector has been as low as ₹82,300 crore over the last five years.The report said since the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) is the only dedicated public sector financial institution for financing renewable energy projects, it must gear up to take up the extra responsibility. It said that the IREDA should make available necessary capital for installation of renewable energy projects so that they are not held up due to non-availability of funds.The report asked the ministry of new and renewable energy to mobilise “more long-term financing and concessional loans through multilateral and bilateral agencies as far as possible”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-renewable-energy-capacity-crosses-100-gigawatts-101628828510812.html

13-08-2021||India||Maharashtra logs 6,388 fresh Covid cases, 208 deaths||As the state government decided to ease the lockdown, many experts have expressed their apprehension and suggested to be cautious in the backdrop of an impending third wave. The state on Thursday recorded 6,388 cases and 208 deaths. The case tally has now reached 6,375,390, while the toll stands at 134,572.There were 210,675 tests done on Thursday, while the number of recoveries were 8,390. There are currently 62,351 active cases across the state of which Pune tops with 14,423, followed by Sangli with 7,027, and Satara with 6,573. Mumbai clocked 281 new Covid-19 cases with seven deaths. The city’s tally has reached 738,520 with 15,975 deaths to date.According to Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor, Maharashtra government for Covid-19 management, such easing of curbs should be done in a staggered manner. “We should first open up districts having fewer cases and low positivity rate,” said Dr Salunkhe. “These areas should be strictly monitored and in case of any surge in cases, the patients need to be isolated,” he said.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his Sunday address, warned the citizens that the pandemic is still not over. He said that people should take care especially during upcoming festival season.From August 15, malls have been given the green signal to open their premises. In addition, hotels and restaurants have been given an extension of timings till 10pm from the previous 4pm. Even weddings in lawns have been allowed with 200 people and in a closed environment, 100 guests or 50% capacity of the hall, whichever is higher.According to Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretary-general, Organised Medicine Academic Guild, the twin approach of mass vaccination and strict action against those who defy the Covid-appropriate behaviour should be adopted by the government. “There is no doubt that the relaxations are necessary, but at the same time, the government needs to deal strictly with those who don’t obey the rules and endanger the lives of others,” said Dr Gilada. “If there is a shortage of vaccines, then the vulnerable section should be vaccinated first,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-logs-6-388-fresh-covid-cases-208-deaths-101628823890410.html

The government is likely to take the action after the assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, which is due next year, people familiar with the matter told Live Hindustan.The people cited by Live Hindustan said that the government is ready to link the voter ID card and the voter list with Aadhaar but it will have to amend the laws. In addition to this, a data protection framework has to be established.In order to link the voter list with Aadhaar, the central government will have to amend the Aadhaar Act along with the Representation of the People Act. This is because, in 2015, the Supreme Court in its judgment on the validity of the Aadhaar Act said that the 12-digit ID would be used only for taking benefits of government welfare schemes and for other facilities, it will not be necessary to ask for Aadhaar number.The Supreme Court said that if the government wants to link the voter list in the Aadhaar ecosystem, it will have to take legal backing for this. The top court then declared privacy as a fundamental right in 2019 and asked the government to make laws for data security. The government has prepared the Data Protection Bill, which is under consideration by the parliamentary committee.The people cited above said the voters' list will not be seeded into the Aadhaar's ecosystem and it will be used only under the One Time Password (OTP) system for verification. These two data will not match, nor will anyone be able to tap or intercept the voter system. This system will undergo extensive trials and linking action will be taken after meeting all aspects of data security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-link-aadhaar-number-with-voter-list-voter-card-to-prevent-fake-voting-report-101628819090584.html

The party alleges that TMC hatched a conspiracy to create an "anarchic situation" in the northeast state.To observe the day, the BJP has planned rallies and small gatherings against the TMC in all 60 constituencies of Tripura.On August 10, Tripura BJP chief spokesperson Subrata Chakraborty alleged West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and TMC chief gave a false statement that her party's leaders, who were allegedly injured in the clash in Ambassa, were not given food and water in police custody last Saturday. "I have video footage that they are being given food and water in custody. The TMC is deliberately trying to create law and order problems so that the fruits of development do not reach the common people," Chakraborty said."The TMC is trying to create an anarchic situation (in Tripura) to create trouble and fish in troubled waters," he added and also alleged that "no TMC worker was injured in any kind of clash."On August 7, workers of both the TMC and the BJP allegedly clashed at Ambassa, about 90 kilometres from Agartala. According to the TMC, two youth leaders from West Bengal, Jaya Datta and Sudip Raha, were injured after their vehicle was attacked by BJP cadres at Ambassa.TMC general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and a few other leaders from Bengal and Tripura were booked recently for allegedly misbehaving with the police in Khowai district where they visited a day after the clash at Ambassa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ambassa-clash-bjp-to-observe-dhikkar-diwas-to-protest-against-tmc-leaders-101628818024747.html

While the sale deed in the case was finalised without any payment, the property was also allegedly undervalued to evade taxes, people familiar with the matter said.Moreover, the difference in amount was also not allegedly deposited in the account of the diocese which ultimately lost ₹60 crore, the people cited above added.The income tax department inspected related documents in the wake of fraud allegations and corroborated the same.HT tried to reach out to the diocese for a response but could not get one immediately.The matter came to light in 2018 when one Shine Varghese moved the high court, seeking an inquiry into the allegations against Alancherry.A single bench of the court directed the police to register relevant cases against the cardinal, who was elected as the Major Archbishop, and also pulled them up for not doing so that year. Alancherry is the senior-most priest of the country.After the diocese allegedly lost money due to the purported land deals, a section of the clergy and citizens revolted against the priest in 2019. Some of them even petitioned Pope Francis in this regard.The cardinal was removed from his post but reinstated after six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cardinal-must-face-trial-in-land-deal-matter-kerala-hc-101628817427242.html

Hence the day strives to help people in realising that volunteering to donate their organs after death can be life-changing for many.People of any age can donate their organs to a person in need. In case a donor is under the age of 18 years, they are required to have the consent of parents or adult guardians to register themselves as an organ donor.History of organ donationThe first-ever organ donation was done in 1954 when Ronald Lee Herrick donated a kidney to his identical twin brother. Doctor Joseph Murray conducted the procedure for which he has also won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1990 for advances in organ transplantation.In 2015, a newborn baby became the youngest ever organ donor after he donated his kidneys to an adult with renal failure. The boy just lived for just 100 minutes after being born.The oldest known donor has been in Scotland where a 107-year-old woman donated cornea after her death in 2016. The oldest known organ donor for an internal organ was a 95-year-old West Virginia man, who donated his liver after he died.Organ donation in IndiaIndia has the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act to regulate organ donation in the country.

The negative RT-PCR test report that the people are supposed to carry with them must not be older than 72 hours. In the case of a Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) report, it must not be older than 24 hours, according to the official order issued by the Himachal Pradesh government earlier this week.Also Read | Himachal’s Covid positivity rate rises to 1.3% in a week“All persons intending to visit the state shall carry their Covid-19 vaccine certificate (double doses) or a negative RT-PCR test report not older than 72 hours or RAT negative report not older than 24 hours w.e.f. 13th August 2021,” Himachal Pradesh chief secretary Ram Subhag Singh said while reading out the government order on Tuesday.Issuing the two-page order following the meet, the chief secretary explained that the coronavirus pandemic situation in the state has been reviewed and it has been observed that the number of active Covid-19 cases and the positivity rate in the state are still increasing. Singh described the situation as quite “precarious”.Himachal Pradesh took the decision to make full vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test report mandatory for travellers entering the state after a cabinet meeting, presided over by chief minister Jairam Thakur, earlier this week.Earlier, the Himachal Pradesh government asked tourists to carry a negative RT-PCR test report not older than 72 hours or proof of full vaccination only when visiting temples in the state during the ‘Shrawan Ashtami Navratras’ religious event from August 9 to 17.Also Read | Himachal Pradesh schools closed, curbs increased to check Covid-19 spreadThe Himachal Pradesh high court even asked the state government on Thursday to reconsider its decision of holding 'Maa Chintpurni Sawan Mela' in Una district, keeping in view the precarious situation, as devotees may visit the fair in large numbers which could lead to an increase in Covid-19 cases.Himachal Pradesh reported as many as 354 new Covid-19 cases and three related deaths in the last 24 hours, pushing the cumulative infection tally in the state to 209,344.

13-08-2021||India||Climate crisis and callous urbanisation will make floods more expensive in India||Over the years, visual imagery around floods in India has undergone a change. From submerged fields and marooned villages in states such as Bihar and Assam, floods now bring pictures of floating cars, submerged subways and floodwater in living rooms within cities.This is not just an anecdotal observation. The climate crisis is beginning to alter rainfall patterns. With a massive surge in urbanisation — an increase in built-up area undermines natural drainage systems – without compensating for the loss of natural drainage systems with man-made ones, floods are bound to cause more damage, at least in monetary terms, in India.All natural disasters, including floods extract heavy human costs. The poor live at subsistence levels and such shocks are always very harsh on them. But the prospect of greater wealth destruction during natural disasters is also worse news for the Indian economy.A simple comparison illustrates the point. From 2008 to 2014, houses were damaged in both Bihar and Kerala every year because of floods and heavy rains. A 2018 Central Water Commission (CWC) report shows that the value lost per damaged house was almost four times in Kerala as in Bihar: ₹2,857 in Bihar and ₹10,906 in Kerala. More than the intensity of floods, this numbers reflects the fact that Kerala houses are better-built than Bihar, because the former has higher per capita income.Richer states and non-farm sector are suffering more damage in floods nowA 2018 CWS report gives state-wise value of damages caused by floods from 1953 to 2016. Sorting these states by per capita GSDP shows that the share of the bottom one-third of states in flood related damages has reduced from more than 50% to just above one-third between 1961-2000 and 2001-2016. This means that India’s more affluent states are suffering a higher damage in floods.Floods are now increasingly affecting the non-farm sector in India. In the 1961 to 2000 period, an average of 58% of the damage caused by floods annually was from the damage to crops while 27% was from public utilities. This pattern has now reversed. From 2001 to 2016, crop loss accounted for an average 29.7% of the damage, while public utilities accounted for 58.6% of monetary losses due to floods. What explains these two changes? Both the climate crisis and the nature of urbanisation are to blame. Intense rainfall is increasing in districts with more affluenceWhile floods affect all, they seem to affect some more than others. Counterintuitive as it sounds, floods cause more monetary damage if they affect an area with a greater share of rich. This is due to the simple reason that richer dwellings have more valuable items than their poorer counterparts. A joint reading of an HT analysis of rainfall patterns and a Mint database of district-wise wealth tracker shows that India’s richer districts are becoming more vulnerable to floods now.Mint’s wealth tracker uses the 2015-16 National Family and Health Survey (NFHS) to rank districts on the basis of assets and amenities (pucca house, electricity connection, phone, television, AC/cooler, refrigerator, washing machine, and motorized vehicle) owned by households. A household is described as affluent if it owns at least six of the eight assets listed here. HT has used the India Meteorological Department’s gridded rainfall database to look at the increase in heavy and extreme rainfall in comparison to the long period average (LPA).The median share of the affluent in districts where heavy and extreme rainfall – when a lot of rain happens in very little time or over a very small area – has increased the most during the 2015 to 2020 period is 20.73%. This share becomes smaller as we move to districts where such rainfall has increased by lesser degrees. In districts where heavy and extreme rainfall has increased the least, the median share of the affluent was 15.4%.It should be kept in mind that the district-wise increase in heavy/extreme rainfall is a relative measure as it is being tracked against past rainfall (1961-2010) in the same district.Concrete jungles without drains are bound to get floodedAlmost every time Kerala faces serious floods, the Cochin airport has to suspend operations, as the runway gets flooded. This should not be surprising. Where the airport has been built, there used to be paddy fields at one point of time, where flooding was a boon rather than a bane.A similar case is of the Santacruz airport in Mumbai built on the floodplains of the Mithi River. During heavy rains in July, Mumbai airport has had to temporarily suspend operations due to waterlogging on either the runways or tarmac in 2017 and in 2021. However, disruptions due to turbulence following heavy rainfall events are more common, recurring every year since 2017. In 2019, a passenger aircraft overshot the main runway while landing in heavy rains on July 2. The main runway remained shut for close to four days. It is common for operations to become restricted to a single runway during heavy rains. Expansion of the airport has squeezed the Mithi river into a small stream, and the construction of a second runway in 1970 created a right-angle bend in the river which has worsened flooding.The cases of these airports are symptomatic of a larger problem with India’s changing land-use pattern. The National Statistical Office (NSO) gives remote sensing-based land-use statistics in India. Built up area increased from 118,998 square kilometres in 2011-12 to 121,848 square kilometres in 2015-16. Of the 3,609 square kilometres added from other sources, 73% came from agriculture, 5.7% from forest land, and 3.3% from grass or grazing land. These numbers capture the rapid surge in concretisation in India in the recent past. An increase in concretised area also means that rainwater does not seep into the ground. In the short-term, this means waterlogging and, in the long-term, it means a fall in replenishment rate of ground water tables.What makes the concretisation problem even worse, at least from the point of view of flooding, is the fact that most Indian cities have built houses but not drains. A government survey carried out in 2010-11 in 104 municipal corporations/Nagar Nigams in large cities found that 56 of them had 50% roads not covered by storm water drainage. Similarly, 745 of 1,383 other urban local bodies (ULB) had less than 50% coverage, and 1,142 ULBs had less than 75% coverage. This is apart from the everyday sight of drains choked with waste or silt where they do exist.When these problems fester in big cities, it can lead to huge losses. Mumbai’s 2005 flooding — when the city received over 900mm of rain in a single day — caused an estimated insurance loss of $0.9 billion, according to a report by Swiss Re Institute. A more recent study by the United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) and accounting firm KPMG, submitted to the Maharashtra government in September 2019, pegged Mumbai’s financial losses as a direct consequence of flooding to be ₹14,000 crore between 2005 and 2015.Experts fear that the financial damage in Mumbai is only going to increase as the city’s natural drainage continues to be subsumed by concrete. In 2019, for example, a plush residential township built on the floodplains of the Mothali river in Dombivali, was flooded with water entering the homes of even those living on the first floor, while similar projects built on the floodplains of the Waldhuni and Ulhas rivers have also experienced similar distress in between 2018 and 2021.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has also noticed that the Mithi River took longer to drain its water into the sea this year than during past seasons, leading to apprehension that Mumbai is staring at more floods in the coming years. Officials and experts attributed this to a combination of factors, including heavy rains coinciding with high-tide, and clogging up of drainage channels with muck and garbage. The BMC this year spent a total of ₹150 crore on its monsoon flood management plan, which showed little to no improvement at fixing the underlying problem.In fact, rapid development of infrastructure may be creating problems in places where they did not exist earlier. For example, residents reported unprecedented waterlogging in 2020 along the strip of South Mumbai that runs from Worli to Girgaum Chowpatty, allegedly due to the Coastal Road project that has buried about 5km of the intertidal zone along the shore, thus preventing water from draining into the sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/climate-crisis-and-callous-urbanisation-will-make-floods-more-expensive-in-india-101628808439408.html
13-08-2021||India||As local Covid-19 clusters emerge in Tamil Nadu, focus on temples, hospitals||With Covid-19 cases nearing the 2000-mark in Tamil Nadu, it is gatherings at temples, hospitals and markets that are of concern now for health officials. A new Covid-19 cluster was detected in Chennai following a temple festival gathering where 300 people were tested and 24 people reported positive in the last three days. One of the infected, a 47-year-old woman, who was diabetic and unvaccinated, succumbed to the virus on Wednesday, officials said. “Strategy-wise we are analysing the causes of spread and we find that sources of infections are streets adjacent to main marketplaces, people visiting hospitals without following protocols like mask compliance and mass gatherings at religious places,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. After consulting experts last week, Tamil Nadu ordered religious places to be shut from Friday to Sunday to avoid large gatherings. A particular zone number 9 (Teynampet) in Chennai in which a major private hospital is located has been reporting new Covid-19 cases continuously. “People rent places near hospitals to stay for their treatment and that is leading to a spread,” a civic official said. Until August 10, Coimbatore district in the western region was reporting the highest number of daily cases and Chennai overtook that marginally on August 11. “In the western region we found that organisation of marriages, funerals and functions flouting the restrictions has led to the increase,” the health secretary said. In the past two weeks, Covid-19 cases in Tamil Nadu have marginally increased but fresh cases have ranged between 1800 and 1900 every day. “We have alerted all districts that these increases can’t be taken lightly and they are taking it seriously because of which the increase in cases has not been geometric. In the next 100 days, we need to vaccinate more people to prevent a wave,” Radhakrishnan said. On Wednesday, he told reporters that several people who had gathered in the temple leading to the cluster were not vaccinated. “Every day we are identifying 10-20 clusters in various places and stopping the spread,” he said. Beginning August 5, Tamil Nadu imposed restrictions on those entering from Kerala as the two states share 13 points of entry just in Coimbatore. Kerala constitutes a major caseload in India and those arriving from there have to produce either a negative RT-PCR test report or evidence of double vaccination. “We are obviously having cases in border areas as people are frequently moving from Kerala,” said an official not wishing to be named. “We are focussing on frequent interstate travellers and encouraging them to get fully vaccinated.”At least 19 districts such as Chennai and its adjoining districts Thiruvallur, Chengalpattu and Kancheepuram, and western and central districts including Coimbatore, Erode, Thanjavur, Trichy and Cuddalore are of concern in the state. “For now localised clusters are emerging and there is no general upward trend,” said Dr Prabhdeep Kaur, deputy director, National Institute of Epidemiology. But these small clusters have the potential to cause general transmission if they are not contained, she warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-local-covid-19-clusters-emerge-in-tamil-nadu-focus-on-temples-hospitals-101628807388830.html
13-08-2021||India||India rules out immediate closure of embassy in Afghanistan||India on Thursday ruled out the immediate closure of its embassy in Afghanistan amid the rapid deterioration of the security situation and said it continued to be engaged with all stakeholders to work for a comprehensive ceasefire and a political settlement. Rapid advances made by the Taliban in recent days, including the capture of nine provincial capitals and fresh attacks on Kandahar and Herat on Thursday, have sharpened security concerns in New Delhi. The Indian government is keeping a close eye on the situation and plans have been drawn up to deal with all contingencies, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi dismissed the possibility of any immediate closure of the Indian mission in Kabul but acknowledged that the rapidly evolving security situation across Afghanistan was “of concern”. “We are monitoring the situation very carefully but there are no plans as such [to close the embassy],” Bagchi told a regular media briefing. India evacuated some 50 officials and security officials from its consulate in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif early on Wednesday against the backdrop of Taliban fighters making rapid advances in the region. The move came exactly a month after evacuated a similar number of personnel from the consulate in southern Kandahar city. The people cited above ruled out any immediate evacuation of officials from Kabul, saying that the government was preparing for all eventualities, including the possible rapid withdrawal of diplomats and Indian nationals. According to information provided by the government in Parliament recently, some 1,500 Indians were in Afghanistan. However, the people said this figure would have come down as many Indians working on development projects had been sent back. Bagchi also pointed to the role being played in Afghanistan by terrorists and jihadi fighters from Pakistan-based groups. Recent reports have said thousands of fighters from groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan have been fighting alongside the Taliban. “Everyone in the world knows what type of role is being played and what concerns others have about jihadi and terrorist elements from Pakistan and what they have done in Afghanistan. The whole world knows it, we don’t need to tell others about it,” he said. The removal of “external malign influences” is essential for for peace in Afghanistan. “We would hope all parties, including regional countries, understand this and work towards a situation where Afghans can have a process that is owned, controlled and led by them. We certainly don’t think that’s currently the situation,” he added. Bagchi said the Indian government is also keeping a close eye on all developments regarding Afghanistan’s Hindu and Sikh minorities. “Last year, our mission in Kabul had facilitated the return of 383 members of the Sikh and Hindu communities in Afghanistan. Our mission continues to remain in touch with the Afghan Hindu and Sikh community members and we will ensure the provision of all necessary assistance to them,” he said. He declined to comment on reports about a fresh US security assessment that Kabul could fall to the Taliban within 30 to 90 days. He added: “We continue to hope that there will be an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire. We are supporting all peace initiatives in Afghanistan. Our primary concern is peace and stability in that country and offering a prosperous future [in an] independent, sovereign and democratic [country].” The external affairs ministry’s pointperson for Afghanistan, joint secretary JP Singh of the Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran desk, represented India at a regional conference hosted by Qatar in Doha on Thursday to find ways to take forward the stalled Afghan peace process. Key stakeholders from Afghanistan also joined the meeting, for which Qatari special envoy Mutlaq bin Majed Al-Qahtani extended an invitation during a visit to New Delhi last week. This was the third meeting on Afghanistan held in Doha since Tuesday, when representatives of the US, the UK, China, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Russia, the UN and the European Union met in the Qatari capital. Wednesday saw a meeting of the “extended troika” that was joined by special envoys from the US, Russia, China and Pakistan. However, the lack of consensus was evident from the fact that extended troika meeting did not produce a joint statement. The last two meetings of this group convened by Russia had resulted in such statements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rules-out-immediate-closure-of-embassy-in-afghanistan-101628805948505.html
13-08-2021||India||Burglars clad in PPE kits pose fresh challenges for Kerala cops||Despite the Covid-19 induced lockdown and restrictions in force in Kerala, burglars are not running short of ideas. They have found an ingenious way to dodge the police and CCTV cameras—a few of them are donning PPE kits and committing the crime. At least four such incidents have been discovered in Kochi and Thrissur in two weeks. This is not a new phenomenon. Such cases have been earlier reported from Delhi, Maharashtra and Kashmir too, crime records show. Usually cops don’t check those in PPE kits and robbers are making use of this opportunity and they can also dodge CCTV cameras in PPE kits. In Thrissur the break-in happened during day time on Wednesday. They took ₹50,000 cash and food articles from a supermarket and ₹10,000 cash and medicines were stolen from a nearby medical store, police said adding the robbery took place between 2 and 4 pm. The CCTV visuals showed that they boarded a car waiting outside the supermarket after the heist. Since it was lunch time not many employees were around in the supermarket. The robbery was noticed two hours after the crime, police said. In Kochi last week, a jewellery shop was burgled but robbers failed to lay their hands on the gold after an alarm rang. There was also an attempt to break into an ATM in Ernakulam. Police said four such cases were reported in Kochi and Thrissur in two weeks. After the incident, police personnel have started keeping a tab on ambulances. Usually nobody stops ambulances especially when Covid-19 cases are mounting in the state. According to the police, such cases were reported from other states also. In Kashmir three men in PPE kits decamped with ₹6 lakh cash and the rifle of the guard at a bank in Baramulla in April. Later three suspects were arrested. In January a man clad in a PPE kit had stolen gold worth ₹13 crore from a jewellery shop in south Delhi’s Kalkaji.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/burglars-clad-in-ppe-kits-pose-fresh-challenges-for-kerala-cops-101628804748669.html
13-08-2021||India||Four days after clash with BJP, two including TMC activist held in Tripura||The Tripura police arrested two people, including one Trinamool Congress activist, after raiding their residences for their alleged involvement in the clash with BJP cadres at Ambassa in Dhalai district that occurred nearly four days ago, a police official said on Thursday. They were taken to court and were sent to judicial custody for four days. According to the police, party workers of both the political parties---the TMC and the BJP clashed at Ambassa, about 90 kilometres from Agartala, on August 7. Four days after the incident, a team of Ambassa police conducted raids at the residences of Amal Bhowmik, an activist of the party and Surajit Sutradhar, the local driver of TMC leader Debangshu Bhattacharya at Amtali in West district on Wednesday night and arrested them. “The Ambassa police are dealing with the matter. Prior to the raid, they informed us and one of our police constables went with them during the raid. We cannot say anything more,” said Amtali sub-divisional police officer Anirban Das.According to TMC, two youth leaders from West Bengal, Jaya Datta and Sudip Raha were injured after their vehicle was attacked by BJP cadres at Ambassa. “Both of them were arrested without any valid reason and we believe it is politically motivated. There is no law and order in the state. Freedom fighters, during the British rule, were arrested forcefully at night. A similar kind of incident is happening in the state,” TMC leader and Rajya Sabha MP Santanu Sen told reporters after arriving in the city and meeting the families of the two people arrested last night. TMC general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and a few other leaders from Bengal and Tripura were booked recently for allegedly misbehaving with the police in Khowai district where they visited a day after the clash at Ambassa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-days-after-clash-with-bjp-two-including-tmc-activist-held-in-tripura-101628803788395.html
13-08-2021||India||PM Modi should let his photo be printed on death certificates: Mamata Banerjee||Just like Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s photo was printed on Covid-19 vaccine certificates, he should now permit his photo to be printed on people’s death certificates, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday. Banerjee also attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government alleging that the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) was asking test questions “given by the BJP” and weakening its foundation as an impartial body. “A person may not be your supporter. But you made it mandatory that your photo should be there on Covid-19 vaccine certificates. I may not like you. But even then, I would have to carry this. Where is the freedom? Now, you should allow your photo on death certificates too,” Banerjee said, without directly referring to Modi, while speaking to the media at the state secretariat. The Bengal government extended Covid-19 restrictions in the state till August 30. The CM said that local train services would remain cancelled even though night curfew timings have been reduced by two hours. No night activities would be allowed between 11 pm and 5 am. The UPSC in an exam for the recruitment of assistant commandants in the CAPF had asked candidates to write 200 words on “Poll violence in West Bengal”. This irked the Bengal chief minister. Questions were also asked on farmers’ protest and oxygen crisis in Delhi. “All these questions are politically motivated and highly objectionable. I don’t understand how an impartial body like the UPSC can set questions like this. I am sorry to say BJP’s party office has prepared the questions. I have respect for UPSC but they have to maintain dignity,” Banerjee said. The BJP, on the other hand has alleged that there has been a lot of post-poll violence in the state, the TMC has refuted the charges saying that some sporadic incidents took place when law and order was with the Election Commission. A committee set up by the National Human Rights Commission has also slammed the state administration for alleged violence. “The TMC-government is using Mamata Banerjee’s photo on Covid-19 certificates in the state, which is illegal. There is no other party or political leader in the country, other than the TMC and Banerjee, who are famous for using photos. By opposing it in this manner, she is projecting the taste of Bengalis in a very bad light,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in the state Earlier this week Union minister of state for health Bharati Pravin Pawar had informed the Rajya Sabha in a written reply that the certificate of vaccination has the Prime Minister’s photo for a specific reason of creating awareness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-should-let-his-photo-be-printed-on-death-certificates-mamata-banerjee-101628799888504.html

The brothers, U Irshad and U Faizal, conceived the idea when the state government made vaccination certificates mandatory for shoppers, tourists and others last week. Customers have options to print vaccination certificates on sleeve, chest or back side of T- shirts.“Initially we started making vaccination e-cards like ATM and other cards. Then we thought of giving a larger imprint and it turned out to be a big hit among youngsters. We have got orders for more than 2,000 shirts now. We charge each shirt ₹250,” said Irshad who is running a modern printing press with his brother. The family is into printing business for the last 30 years. Irshad’s father founded ‘Imperial Press’ 60 years ago and it has now two branches in Kottappadi and Alathurpadi of Malappuram district.“We are flooded with enquiries. We get enough requests in social media also. We can courier the shirts if customers are ready to pay the charges. Many are sending us vax certificates on WhatApp. Now we are printing maximum certificates on white shirts but colour options are also there,” said Faizal. “We procure T-shirts from Coimbatore on wholesale price and make a decent profit. Yes, it is good to make hay while the sun shines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tshirts-printed-with-vax-certificates-take-a-hit-in-kerala-101628798089428.html
13-08-2021||India||Kerala denies high breakthrough Covid infections cited by Centre||Thiruvananthapuram: Grappling with a high Covid-19 caseload and test positivity rate for more than two months, Kerala has started a study on breakthrough infections and re-infections, even as the state health department has rejected the Centre’s numbers on breakthrough infections. A breakthrough case refers to a fully vaccinated person getting infected again and re-infection means a completely recovered individual contracting the coronavirus again. The state health department said while the Union health ministry quoted 40,000 breakthrough infections in Kerala, according to its rough estimate, the numbers will be between 5,000 and 6,000 -- among them 40% are frontline workers, including health and police personnel. “We have no idea about 40,000 cases as mentioned by the Union health ministry. Our estimate is less than 0.1%, which means around 5000-5500 breakthrough cases,” said a senior health official who did not want to be named. The Union health ministry said the country had reported over 100,000 breakthrough cases, of which Kerala’s share was 40,000. Later, a central team visiting the state earlier this month also confirmed high incidences of breakthrough cases in Kerala. They said Pathanamthitta district alone reported more than 7,000 breakthrough cases.But district medical officer Dr A L Sheeja refuted these statistics. “Only 258 such cases reported in the district. I have no idea how they got such large numbers,” she said. “Pathanamthitta is one of the least affected districts. All cases have been closely monitored and there was no chance of such huge numbers.”Earlier, health minister Veena George, hailing from the same district, also denied a spike in breakthrough infections in Pathanamthitta.The health department has sent samples of all breakthrough infections for genome sequencing to rule out the possibility of a new variant. Though experts suspected a new variant behind the steady rise of cases in the state, the Indian Council of Medical Research is yet to confirm it. For almost two months, the state has been reporting more than half the national caseload.On Thursday the state reported 21,445 cases with a test positivity rate of 14.73 % when 1,45, 582 samples were tested. It also reported 160 deaths and active cases stand at 1,76,518, according to the state health ministry. On Tuesday, TPR -- the number of tests returning positive out of total tests done -- was 15.91%, highest in three months. Among breakthrough infections, health workers form a large chunk. Twenty-four-year-old nursing officer Gokul MG, who works with a medical college hospital in Thiruvananthpauram, was down with Covid-19 twice, first in August and second in November, still he prefers to work at the Covid ICU. “How can I rest when people need me the most,” said Gokul, who received two jabs in the initial days of inoculation drive.He says many health workers like him were infected more than twice. But they all said intensity of the infection was very low and at times it was asymptomatic. Now the health department has asked all workers who come in contact with patients to undergo regular antigen or RT-PCR tests.The central team, which visited the eight worst-affected districts, found that high density of population, prevalence of highly infectious Delta virus and laxity in home quarantine are main reasons for high caseload in the state.Kerala also has a high population of elderly people and prevalence of lifestyle diseases also quite high, medical records show. The central team also found flaws in protocols and home isolation. In districts like Malappuram and Kozhikode, family size is huge and the infected people easily pass the virus to others, it said. Though in home isolation, the infected should have a separate washroom and nobody should be allowed to enter his/her quarantine room, the team found that these measures were seldom met. This led to increased transmission within homes and formation of small clusters. Amid the Covid surge in Kerala, Onam festival, a week away, is a worry for the health department. Though large gatherings and celebrations are banned, many experts fear that the festive occasion could be a triggering factor.According to the state health ministry, 2,24,29,007 people were given vaccination till Wednesday -- 1,58,68, 802 (45.5% of the state’s population) have been administered the first dose and 64,60,205 (18.41%) both the doses. At least, 800,000 more doses reached the state on Thursday, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-denies-high-breakthrough-covid-infections-cited-by-centre-101628797970296.html
13-08-2021||India||499 Covid cases among those under the age of 19: Data||Bengaluru: In the first week of August, Bengaluru reported 499 cases of Covid-19 among children under the age of 19. Among the 499 cases, 263 were reported between August 5 to August 10, and out of these, 88 were between 0 to 9 years and 175 were between 10 and 19 years old., as per state’s health bulletin. Though the rise in numbers is causing concerns at a time when the apprehension of a third wave of the pandemic is looming large, however, the city administration has said that there is no alarming increase in the number of cases, the bulletin said. Talking about cases among the children, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) commissioner Gaurav Gupta said city administration is monitoring the numbers closely. “We are closely watching the numbers. So far, we are seeing the same rate of infections this year as 2020. In case these numbers go up we will take the required steps,” said Gupta. When asked about the dangers the children are likely to face in the third wave, Gupta said that the authorities are working towards ensuring that all age groups are protected. “It is important to keep children safe from getting infected from other family members who have the chance of coming in contact with other people. So, maintaining the Covid protocols at home is as important,” Gupta added. BBMP special commissioner (Health), D Randeep, said that there is no increase in the number of hospitalizations among children. “We have zero pediatric deaths during this time. The absolute numbers should not be considered as an alarming increase. The fact that there has been no increase in hospitalisation reported either,” he said. With the fear of these numbers increasing over a period of time, parents are concerned, especially since the state government has decided to reopen schools for Classes 9 to 12 from August 23 onwards. The government has also announced that the decision to reopen schools for students up to Class 8 will be taken in the last week of August after looking at all aspects of the third wave.“The authorities will say that these numbers are not alarming, but the numbers don’t give us confidence. The government should study the increase in cases and reconsider the decision to reopen schools,” said Simon Inasu, a businessman and a parent of a Class10 student. The state is recording 1,500 plus Covid cases on an average and so far 15,919 deaths have occurred due to the virus. At least 19 children between the ages of 0 and 9 have died and 26 children in the age group of 10 to 19 have lost their lives. The health department has taken note of the situation and parents have been advised to vaccinate themselves fully first and then monitor their children properly and avoid them from crowded places. “This issue will be taken up in the expert committee meeting. The state government will take all steps required if this becomes a serious situation,” said a senior health department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/499-covid-cases-among-those-under-the-age-of-19-data-101628797908429.html
13-08-2021||India||Average age of India’s population should reflect in CPI(M): Yechury in Bengal||The median age of the nation’s population, which is around 28 years, should reflect in the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or else it will not be able to counter its political opponents, the party’s general secretary, Sitaram Yechury, told members of the West Bengal state committee at a closed-door meeting on Thursday. The two-day meeting, which started on Thursday and continued till late evening, has been convened to review the organizational weaknesses of the CPI (M) in Bengal where, for the first time since 1946, it failed to win a single assembly seat in the March-April polls. Several members of the CPI(M) central committee are more than 75 years old. Prominent among them are Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, 76, Bengal Left Front chairman Biman Bose, 81, and prominent Kerala leader S Ramachandran Pillai, 83. Yechury made the statement days after CPI(M) central committee members from across the nation raised a proposal during a three-day virtual meet that no member aged above 75 should stay in the body. The central committee is the party’s highest decision making platform. The proposal will be placed for adoption at the CPI(M)’s 23rd party Congress to be held in Kerala in April 2023. Bengal state committee members who attended Thursday’s session told HT on condition of anonymity that Yechury, who spoke for almost one hour, was bitterly critical of the state unit’s failure. “While focusing on several organizational issues, he said the party cannot counter its opponents, especially the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), if the median age of the nation’s population does not reflect in the rank and file. He said fixing a quota for youth in party units will yield no result unless they are given responsibility and leadership roles,” said a state committee member. “The party earlier decided that 20% positions in all units should be reserved for leaders aged up to 30 years. Yechury emphatically said that these leaders should be made part of the CPI(M)’s policy making process,” said a second state committee member. In the recent assembly polls, the BJP bagged 77 seats against 213 won by the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). State and district leaders of both these parties are comparatively younger than their counterparts in the CPI(M). Before the 2018 panchayat polls, the CPI(M) tried to overhaul its organisation across all 23 districts of Bengal. It replaced more than 60% leaders aged between 60 and 80. Some prominent former ministers and local heavyweights were replaced with people who were in their 40s and 50s. As many as seven district committees, including the one in Kolkata, got new secretaries. In a bid to streamline the party structure, the CPI(M) also completely did away with the zonal committees in 2018. The CPI(M) earlier divided every district into several zones and each zone had a committee that was answerable to the district committee, the top body in a district that reports directly to the state committee headed by the state secretary. The zonal committees used to supervise the performance of area committees. The area committees monitored branch committees which are the party’s organizational set up at the lowest level. CPI(M) leaders said on Thursday that the shakeup did not yield any result in the panchayat, Lok Sabha and assembly polls although more than 300 younger people were inducted in branch and area committees in 2018. Organisational elections will be held again the coming months. In 1953, when Jyoti Basu became the Bengal state secretary of the undivided Communist Party of India, he was only 39. Majority of the frontline leaders were his contemporaries while many of the foot soldiers were youngsters from college, party leaders said. In 2015, four years after the CPI-M and its Left Front partners were voted out of power, the Marxists had little presence among the youth and most of their leaders in the cities and districts were aged between 60 and 80, the CPI(M) said in its internal report presented at the crucial organizational plenum. It was held in Kolkata in December 2015. A portion of the plenum report said the Telangana unit of the CPI(M) had the highest number of young members, while in Bengal only 13.5 % members were less than 31 years old. Even in Tripura, where the party was defeated by the BJP in 2018, this age group accounted for only 18.3 % members in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/average-age-of-india-s-population-should-reflect-in-cpi-m-yechury-in-bengal-101628797728515.html
13-08-2021||India||CT Ravi stokes controversy with remarks on Nehru, Indira||Bengaluru The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Karnataka has courted controversy once again by proposing that the Congress open a (hookah) bar in the name of India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. CT Ravi, BJPs national general secretary and legislator from Chikmagalur on Thursday made the comments as an extension of his earlier demands to change the name of Indira canteens, eateries set up by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government, to Annapurna canteens. “Is that a five star hotel? To fill up their ATMs, they kept Indira Gandhi’s name, should we accept it? We oppose it because it was done for political reasons,” Ravi said.  “With Congress money, let them open an Indira canteen, Nehru bar, Nehru hookah bar in their office”, Ravi said in Bengaluru on Thursday. The statements have triggered a war of words with the Congress hitting back at Ravi. “CT Ravi was for a brief time the Kannada and culture minister. He is not just an MLA. He is a general secretary of a national party. He is reflecting his and the BJPs culture (with such statements) by smearing the names of Indira Gandhi, (Jawaharlal) Nehru, Rajiv Gandhi,” DK Shivakumar, the state Congress president said on Thursday. Siddaramaiah, the Congress leader of the opposition, said that there are places and institutions named after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, late Arun Jaitley, Deendayal Upadhyay, Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and Atal Bihari Vajpayee among others. “Open a hookah bar in their names,” Siddaramaiah said, adding, “He should not be loose with his words. Ravi is a national general secretary. He must know his responsibility.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ct-ravi-stokes-controversy-with-remarks-on-nehru-indira-101628797069880.html
13-08-2021||India||Illegal mining case: Can’t allow Janardhan Reddy to stay in Bellary, CBI tells SC||New Delhi Permitting illegal mining accused and former Karnataka minister Gali Janardan Reddy to permanently stay in Bellary will convey a wrong message as the trial in the case is yet to begin and there are 47 witnesses of this case residing in the district whose lives will be under serious threat, said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to the Supreme Court on Thursday.The agency probing the illegal mining case against companies owned by Reddy brothers of Bellary was arguing against a petition filed by one of the brothers to relax one of the bail conditions imposed by the top court restraining him from entering Bellary. The Supreme Court had granted bail to Reddy in the illegal mining case on January 20, 2015, more than three years after he was arrested in September 2011.Senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Ranjeet Kumar who appeared for Reddy pointed out that the CBI had filed charge sheets in the case and had filed a memo on July 16, 2021 before the court of Principal Special Judge, Hyderabad, stating that investigation is complete. Reddy in his affidavit filed through advocate Parmatma Singh said, “In the said memo, it is clearly averred on behalf of the CBI that the investigation in the FIR being RC17(A)/2009 dated December 7, 2009 is complete and there are no further reports to be filed u/s 173(8) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”The bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maeshwari told CBI that if this was true it can record a statement to this effect. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Madhvi Divan appearing for CBI sought time to take instructions and the matter was posted for hearing on Friday.Divan told the Court that in this case, the nine accused – including former ministers and bureaucrats – have been acting in tandem and delaying the trial by filing discharge applications, quashing petitions and bail petitions to crowd the docket of the trial court. “The fact that this man (Reddy) is permanently going to stay in Bellary sends a wrong message. This is one of the most notorious mining scams ever. We want to go on with the trial but their permanent stay in Bellary will be detrimental to the trial. A message must go from this court to ensure trial in this case is started,” the ASG submittedRohatgi said, “These restrictions are harsh and amount to externment. For how long can Reddy be kept out of his hometown Bellary. This condition must be waived. With nearly 10,000 documents and 300 witnesses, the trial will not end in the next 10 years if it goes this way.”CBI informed the court that out of 300 witnesses, 47 reside in Bellary. Of them, 30 are public servants and bank officials while 15 are private persons. “These witnesses are very crucial for the prosecution case….The petitioner’s firms namely Obalapuram Mining Corporation Private Limited and Bellary Iron Ore Private Limited had criminally intimidated these witnesses and extorted the iron ore from these witnesses and their mining companies by forcing them to sell the iron ore at much lesser price than the prevailing market rates.”Since the accused were restrained from entering Bellary, these witnesses were able to muster the courage to reveal these facts, hoping to get justice, the CBI said, adding that the petitioner’s stay at Bellary shall pose a “serious threat to the lives of these witnesses” as was evident through their statements before the arrest of the accused.Kumar, also appearing for Reddy said that the cases raked up by CBI were of 2012-13 and no complaint of intimidation has been filed after grant of bail. One such case was even closed for want of evidence. Since grant of bail by the top court, Reddy was allowed to visit Bellary on eight occasions. To avoid filing applications for permission to enter Bellary from time to time, the top court had allowed him to move an application for modifying the bail condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/illegal-mining-case-can-t-allow-janardhan-reddy-to-stay-in-bellary-cbi-tells-sc-101628796709603.html
13-08-2021||India||Anand Singh, the man at centre of discontent in Karnataka cabinet||Bengaluru: On July 1, 2019, former mining baron and Congress legislator from the mineral-rich Ballari district, about 320 kms from Bengaluru, triggered an exodus from the HD Kumaraswamy-led coalition government that eventually led to its collapse. This former Congress legislator was Anand Singh, whose decision had led to a juggernaut of sorts which helped the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) finally realise its efforts to get a chunk of disgruntled legislators from the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S)-Congress to quit and defect to the BJP, which eventually formed the government. Though Singh was never portrayed as the catalyst in this episode, he has used this card for the second time in two years to help him land a plum portfolio. First, in the BS Yediyurappa cabinet and now in that of his successor, Basavaraj Bommai. Singh, who had rubbed shoulders with the likes of illegal mining kingpin Gali Janardhana Reddy, has since seen himself turn “victim” on more than one occasion, the latest being his unhappiness over the portfolio allotted to him in the Bommai Cabinet. He is among the 29 ministers in Bommai’s Cabinet and has been allocated the tourism, environment and ecology portfolio. Singh has even threatened to resign as legislator if Bommai does not give him a better portfolio. “It is true that I have asked for a change in portfolio and he has taken my request into consideration and has said that he will talk to the seniors in the party and I will stay with him to cooperate,” Singh said on Wednesday night after meeting with the chief minister. The minister could not be reached for comment on Thursday. Singh’s threat and demand for a better portfolio adds to the mounting challenges of the Bommai-led government which has found itself trying to douse one crisis after another in the two weeks of its existence.Singh, in the past, has claimed to have got more than his demands when Yediyurappa carved out Vijayanagara as a district from Ballari. In February last year, Singh had even forced Yediyurappa to change his portfolio from food & civil supplies to forest. Incidentally, there are over a dozen cases of violating the Forest Act in mining, creating a conflict that was clearly overlooked by the BJP. Singh, who was once seen as a powerful political force, landed in a hospital in January 2019 with grievous injuries after his former aide and Congress colleague Kampli Ganesh allegedly assaulted him in Eagleton resort where the party was trying to keep its MLAs safe from any attempt by the BJP to poach them before the coalitions trust vote. While Singh and N Nagaraju (MTB) are demanding re-allocation of portfolios, a significant chunk of legislators are also demanding that they be included in the Cabinet after being overlooked to favor those loyal to Yediyurappa. One set of disgruntled legislators of the BJP have been meeting at former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi’s house while the supporters of several others have been threatening to lay siege the chief minister’s house to get a berth for their MLA. Supporters of Madikeri (Kodagu) BJP legislator, Apachu Ranjan, have threatened to drive to Bengaluru and “gherao” Bommai’s home for excluding the MLA from the Cabinet despite his seniority. “Things will fall in place in a few days. There will be some dissatisfaction among those who missed out (on ministerial berths),” one minister said, requesting not to be named. Though Bommai replaced Yediyurappa as chief minister, the latter has so far had full control over the selection of the Cabinet and rewarding those loyal to him, including the defectors, antagonizing core-BJP legislators who have nursed a feeling of neglect in the last two years. This was exacerbated when Bommai, who has been in the BJP only for the last 13 years, was named as chief minister over seniors who have been there for much longer and identify with the core ideology of the saffron party. Bommai himself is under fire over the floods, resurgence of Covid-19, economy and even for meeting JD(S) supremo, HD Deve Gowda within 24 hours of taking oath as chief minister. Preetham Gowda, a first-time MLA from Hassan district, has questioned the chief minister’s decision to meet the former Prime minister as it would send out a wrong message to the party workers ahead of the Zilla and taluk panchayat elections, expected to be held later this year. On Thursday, the BJP MLA from Mudigere, MP Kumaraswamy staged a protest against his own party’s government for failing to provide flood relief to people in his constituency, adding to the embarrassment of the new chief minister. “There are another 18-19 months of our term left and are hopeful of getting a chance (in the cabinet) now,” MP Renukacharya, a BJP legislator said on Thursday after meeting with the party’s senior leadership in Delhi. Bommai has his hands full. While Singh can be called the catalyst in the first defection drama to instate Yediyurappa in the top post two years ago, his threats to resign is just one of the many hurdles that has kicked up a storm in the Bommai era.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anand-singh-the-man-at-centre-of-discontent-in-karnataka-cabinet-101628796288000.html
13-08-2021||India||Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar meets Amit Shah in Delhi||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar met Union home minister Amit Shah at the latter’s residence in New Delhi on Thursday. The meeting took place a day after Dhankhar met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Parliament House, triggering strong reaction in Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) which shares an acrimonious relationship with the governor. “WB Governor Shri Jagdeep Dhankhar called on Shri @AmitShah Union Home Minister @HMOIndia today at his residence.” Dhankhar tweeted around 10 pm on Thursday and also posted a photograph. TMC leaders did not react to this till 10.30 pm. During his earlier trips to Delhi, the governor met Shah and submitted reports on the law and order situation in the state. Dhankhar has been extremely vocal on the political violence in the state since the March-April assembly polls. On Wednesday, Dhankhar described his meeting with the Prime Minister as a “courtesy call.” This, however, did not stop the TMC from attacking him. “We don’t know why the governor met the Prime Minister. Probably he is making preparations to formally join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which he represents anyway,” said TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh. Raj Bhawan officials said Dhankhar did not specify how long he will stay in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-governor-jagdeep-dhankhar-meets-amit-shah-in-delhi-101628795927906.html
13-08-2021||India||Kinnaur landslide toll rises to 14 with recovery of four more bodies||The death toll in the Kinnaur landslide rose to 14 with the recovery of four more bodies on Thursday morning. The bodies were found in the wreckage of a Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) bus, which had slid down National Highway 5 after being hit by big boulders during the landslide.The bus carrying around 22 passengers was en route to Haridwar from Reckong Peo when the mishap took place. A few other private vehicles, including a truck, a car and a Tata Sumo were also buried under the debris, and have now been recovered. Kinnaur superintendent of police Sarju Ram Rana said, “The wreckage of the HRTC bus was found 70metres down the National Highway 5. It was carrying around 22 passengers when it got buried.”“Four bodies of passengers were recovered from the wreckage of the bus this morning, taking the toll to 14. Until last night, 10 bodies had been retrieved till the suspension of rescue operations.” Stating that more people are feared to be trapped under the debris, Rana said, “We don’t have the exact number but we expect that it could be as high as 25.”HRTC managing director Sandeep Kumar confirmed that there were about 22 passengers in the HRTC bus. “Both the driver and conductor had alighted from the vehicle to inquire about the condition of the road when the bus got buried under the debris,” said Kumar, adding that both are still in a state of shock.Teams of the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Disaster Response Force, Army and Himachal Police, are carrying out rescue operations. About a 70 metre stretch of the highway has been blocked by the debris. The road was reopened for traffic last night. There were about 300 vehicles stranded on the both sides of the road. CM visits Negulseri to oversee rescue opsChief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Thursday visited Negulseri, the landslide site in Kinnaur to oversee the relief and rescue operations. He also announced ₹4 lakh relief for the next of kin of the deceased and ₹50,000 to those critically injured in the tragic incident. He said the transport department would also provide ₹1 lakh to kin of the passengers of the HRTC bus who died in Wednesday’s incident. He said that free treatment would also be provided to all the injured by the state government. The CM later paid a visit to the community health centre in Bhawanagar and enquired about the well-being of the injured and wished them speedy recovery. The CM also lauded the services of the ITBP, NDRF, CISF, state police personnel and local people in relief and rescue operations. He said that the state government will conduct a geological survey of the area as a long-term solution.

Vidhan Sabha speaker Vipin Parmar also condoled the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kinnaur-landslide-toll-rises-to-14-with-recovery-of-four-more-bodies-101628795869647.html
13-08-2021||India||BKU faction seeks feedback on contesting polls||A faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, a farmers’ outfit protesting against three agricultural laws enacted by the Modi government last year, on Thursday launched a Twitter poll on whether it should contest elections, taking an idea it has been toying with to the public. The Bhupinder Singh Mann-led faction, mainly active in Punjab, said this was the second time it had launched such a drive to test political waters and it is yet to take a decision. The last poll in August showed over two-thirds of the people wanted it to contest elections. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella organisation spearheading the protests, however, said the platform would remain apolitical, but it would ask voters in the forthcoming state elections to cast their votes against the Bharatiya Janata Party, which rules both at the Centre and poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. Farm unions have been on protests since last November, demanding the government roll back three agricultural laws that seek to bring a more liberal regime of farm trade. The government has argued that these reforms are necessary to modernise the farm sector, while the farmers say the changes will leave them at the mercy of large corporations. “We as a farmers’ collective have already made three decisions. One, we will tell farmers to vote against the BJP; two, we will not ask farmers to vote for any particular party; and three, we will not allow any political party to campaign from our platform,” said Hannan Mollah, a key member of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha. The faction which has asked for public’s suggestion on whether it should contest polls said it will decide only after detailed deliberations and the Twitter poll is just one of them. “We believe it is time for farmers to act politically, but we have not taken any decision yet on registering a political party,” Jai Singh, a spokesperson of the outfit said. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said in the just-concluded Parliament session that the Union government was ready to discuss the farm laws and their provisions with the protesting farmers but there was no possibility of repealing the legislation. The minister also said the system of assured prices for agricultural produce, known as minimum support prices, would continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bku-faction-seeks-feedback-on-contesting-polls-101628795209001.html

During the grouping’s first summit in March, the Quad decided to set up working groups focused on these three areas.Thursday’s meeting was a follow-up to the meeting of foreign ministers on February 18 and the virtual Quad leaders summit on March 12. The external affairs ministry said the officials discussed the wide-ranging impact of Covid-19 in the Indo-Pacific and the importance of collaborative efforts to contain the pandemic and ensure health security and a quick economic recovery.The officials explored the possibility of collaboration in resilient supply chains, emerging and critical technologies, maritime security, cyber security, counter-terrorism, infrastructure and connectivity, higher education, climate change and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, the ministry added.Japan’s foreign ministry said in a readout that the officials concurred on advancing practical cooperation on these issues to achieve a free and open Indo-Pacific. The officials also exchanged views on regional issues such as the situation in North Korea, the East and South China Seas and Myanmar.A statement from the US state department said the “four democracies acknowledged that global security and prosperity depends on the region remaining inclusive, resilient, and healthy”.Also Read| India defeats China for ReCAAP elections with Quad on its sideThe officials also examined ways to advance cooperation such as strategic challenges confronting the region, countering disinformation, promoting democracy and human rights, strengthening international institutions such as the UN and related bodies, and “supporting countries vulnerable to coercive actions in the Indo-Pacific”, the US statement added.The Quad vaccine partnership was created to manufacture vaccines developed by the US in India with funding from the American and Japanese development banks. These jabs were to be distributed among developing countries across the Indo-Pacific with Australia’s logistics chain.The members of Quad were looking to start the distribution of the vaccines as early as the second quarter of this year, but these plans suffered a setback after India was hit hard by a second wave of Covid-19 infections in March and all vaccine stocks were repurposed for the domestic vaccination programme.The Quad members are now hoping to get the initiative rolling by early 2022, especially to counter China, which has taken the lead in delivering jabs to South and Southeast Asian countries either as donations or commercial supplies.During the meeting, the officials welcomed the fact that a free and open Indo-Pacific as a “vision for the peace and prosperity of the region and its importance in the post-Covid world is increasing”, the readout from Japan’s foreign ministry said.This vision has spread in the world community, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and Europe, and the officials reaffirmed the importance of broadening cooperation with more countries for its further achievement, the readout added.The officials reaffirmed their strong support for Asean’ unity and centrality and the Asean-led regional architecture, as well as full support for Asean’s Indo-Pacific policy.The officials agreed to work towards holding an in-person summit by the end of this year, as well as a foreign minister’s meeting at least once a year.Also Read| Quad special forces to wargame off Guam in Indo-PacificThe meeting was joined by Vani Rao, joint secretary (Americas) and Naveen Srivastava, additional secretary (East Asia) from the external affairs ministry, deputy minister for foreign policy Masataka Okano and deputy director general (Asian and Oceanian Affairs Bureau) Kazuya Endo from Japan’s foreign ministry, Justin Hayhurst, deputy secretary (Indo-Pacific Group) and Lauren Bain, assistant secretary (ASEAN and regional architecture branch) from Australia’s foreign ministry, and Richard Buangan from the bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs and Dean Thompson, acting assistant secretary (South and Central Asian Affairs) from the US state department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infra-and-maritime-security-top-agenda-at-virtual-quad-meeting-101628795087169.html
13-08-2021||India||Health minister meets WHO chief scientist, talks nod for Covaxin||Union health minister, Mansukh Mandaviya, met World Health Organisation (WHO) chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan on Thursday to discuss, among other coronavirus disease (Covid-19) related issues, Bharat Biotech’s impending approval for the Covaxin vaccine with the UN health body.“Held a meeting with Dr Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist of @WHO. We had a productive discussion on WHO’s approval of @BharatBiotech’s COVAXIN. @DoctorSoumya also appreciated India’s efforts for the containment of #Covid-19,” tweeted health minister Mandaviya.Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech has applied for WHO’s emergency use listing for the anti Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin, that the company co-developed with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).All documents required for the emergency use listing (EUL) have been submitted by Bharat Biotech for Covaxin to the World Health Organization by July 9, and the review process by the UN health body has also started.“The discussion was fruitful. The EUL process is on track; and the approval should come through soon. There’s a due process that needs to be followed, which takes its own time,” said a senior government official familiar with the matter, on condition of anonymity.Responding to question on whether it has come to the notice of the government that Covaxin used in India as Covid vaccine is not recognised by many countries, minister of state for health, Bharati Pravin Pawar, in a written reply earlier in Parliament said, “The Government of India is aware that Covaxin at present is not part of WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL).”Elaborating on efforts that have been made by the government to resolve this issue, Pawar had said, “All documents required for Emergency Use Listing (EUL) have been submitted by Bharat Biotech International Ltd. to WHO as of 9th July 2021. The review process by WHO has commenced. WHO usually takes up to six weeks to decide on Emergency Use Listing (EUL) submissions.”Developed by Bharat Biotech in partnership with National Institute of Virology and ICMR, Covaxin was approved for emergency use on January 3, 2021. The clinical trials have shown that the vaccine has an efficacy if nearly 78%.Bharat Biotech has repurposed its Chiron Behring manufacturing plant in Ankleshwar, Gujarat, that it had been using for anti-rabies vaccine production, to scale up production of Covaxin.“Decision to manufacture Covaxin at Ankleshwar Gujarat was taken several months ago with planning and preparatory activities. Facility preparations and production activities commenced during June 2021, Product will be available for supplies during September 2021,” said a person familiar with the matter, on condition of anonymity.With a couple of other public sector undertakings (PSU) also being roped in for manufacturing Covaxin doses, the production number of Covaxin is projected to increase from the current 25 million doses a month to at least 58 million doses, according to the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-minister-meets-who-chief-scientist-talks-nod-for-covaxin-101628795029250.html
13-08-2021||India||LCA Mk-1A to take first flight by March, says HAL chairman||State-run plane maker Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has set a March 2022 deadline to carry out the first flight of the LCA (light combat aircraft) Mk-1A jet after wrapping up the necessary design activities, HAL chairman R Madhavan said on Thursday.HAL will also next week announce a multimillion-dollar engine deal with US firm GE Aviation for 99 F404 engines to power India’s latest indigenous fighter, he said. The developments come six months after the defence ministry awarded a ₹48,000-crore contract to HAL for 83 LCA Mk-1A jets for the Indian Air Force (IAF). The first Mk-1A aircraft will be delivered to the air force by March 2024, with the rest slated to join its combat fleet by 2029.“The preliminary design review is over and so is the critical design review for several systems, including mission computer, digital map generator and digital flight control systems. We are integrating the active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and the electronic warfare suite on the final operational clearance (FOC) version of the LCA. After it is proven there, we will integrate it on the final Mk-1A version,” the HAL chairman said. AESA radar provides superior detection, tracking and targeting capabilities.The contract for the 83 Mk-1A jets took the total number of LCA variants ordered to 123. The 40 LCAs already ordered by IAF are in the initial operational clearance (IOC) and the more advanced FOC configurations. The LCA Mk-1A will come with a raft of additional improvements over the FOC aircraft, making it the most advanced LCA variant so far.Madhavan said HAL was working with Aeronautical Development Agency, a principal partner in the fighter jet project, on software development for the Mk-1A jet and the effort was progressing smoothly. “This is for all the software that has to be changed in the Mk-1A aircraft because of new systems coming in. We plan to carry of out the first flight of the aircraft by March 2022 and get the certification from the Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification (CEMILAC) by mid-2023 before kicking off production,” he said.A regulatory body under the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), CEMILAC is responsible for the airworthiness certification of military aircraft, helicopters, aero-engines and air-launched weapons.The delivery schedule requires HAL to provide the IAF with the first two aircraft in 2024, eight in 2025 and the remaining in batches by 2029 at the rate of 14 to 16 fighters every year.“We are working on a tight schedule, but HAL may deliver all the aircraft ahead of time. We will deliver a new aircraft with significant changes three years after the signing of contract. Even foreign original equipment manufacturers (OEM) take about five to six years to do something like that,” the HAL chairman said.He said the deal for the F404 engines for the Mk-1A aircraft had been finalised, with HAL striking a good bargain with GE Aviation after several rounds of negotiations. Expected to be worth around $700 million, the engine deal is the biggest contract being awarded by HAL for the project. The existing LCA variants use the same engine.“We have got a good price from GE Aviation after 17 to 18 rounds of negotiations. HAL is also holding discussions with its entire vendor base for reducing cost as the volumes are higher. The target is a price reduction of 15% to 20%,” Madhavan said. HAL has set a deadline of November 2021 to place purchase orders for raw materials so that machining activities can begin next year onwards, he said.The Mk-1A variant will come with digital radar warning receivers, external self-protection jammer pods, AESA radar, advanced beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles and significantly improved maintainability. The fighter’s indigenous content is expected to be around 60%, compared to 50% in the existing variants.“HAL now has to perform since the stakes involved are very high -- IAF’s potency is dependent on it. HAL’s work culture and ethos have to turn a new leaf to ensure that aircraft production timelines are met. Rigid adherence to quality in production and timely provisioning of spares would define successful contract implementation,” Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), former additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies, previously told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lca-mk-1a-to-take-first-flight-by-march-says-hal-chairman-101628794848874.html

She worked as a salesperson at a shop in the city. But when she did not return home after work, her father filed a missing complaint at Mapusa police station, said a police officer.When she was spotted washed ashore on the Calangute beach on Thursday morning, police said a preliminary inquiry revealed her identity to be the same as the one who was reported missing.

Both the Supreme Court and the Jharkhand High Court took suo motu cognisance of the incident, with CCTV camera footage showing a vehicle seemigly swerving deliberately to hit the judge, who was out on his morning walk, and speeding away. The apex court directed the central agency to file a status report every week with the high court.The investigation officer in the case also appeared before the division bench of Jharkand HC chief justice Ravi Ranjan and justice Sujit Narayan Prasad that directed the agency to carry out a proper investigation and submit a detailed report next week.During the hearing, the court also sought details from the state government about security measures for judges in Dhanbad. “I can’t comment on the content of the status report. We submitted the first status report today as per the Supreme Court’s direction. The next progress report will be submitted for the next hearing on August 20,” said CBI counsel Rajiv Sinha.A news agency quoted Jharkhand advocate general Rajiv Ranjan saying that the HC was not satisfied with the status report. “CBI submitted its report before the HC. The HC was not satisfied with it so it has asked CBI for a detailed report. They have to file it next week,” Ranjan told news agency ANI.People involved in the proceedings said the bench sought to know from the investigation officer details of the forensic report of the crime scene and the auto rickshaw and the interrogation of people seen passing by in the footage. The agency informed the court that with a local court’s permission they took custody of the auto rickshaw involved in the accident to recreate the crime scene and that the forensic report of the samples lifted f was still awaited. The agency also informed the court that they have questioned one of two bike riders captured on CCTV passing by the same road at the time of the accident.Additional district judge Uttam Anand was brought dead to the hospital on July 28, about an hour after he was hit by a vehicle near Randhir Verma square in Dhanbad. Two people who were riding the three-wheeler, identified as driver Lakhan Verma and his associate Rahul Verma were arrested by Jharkhand police the next morning and the vehicle was seized. CBI took over the investigation from the SIT headed by an ADG rank officer of Jharkhand Police at the state government’s instance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-submits-1st-report-in-dhanbad-judge-case-101628794731281.html

13-08-2021||India||Former IIT prof moves OBC panel over ‘caste bias’ at the institute||A former assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, who resigned from the institution in July alleging caste-based discrimination, has approached the National Commission for Backward Classes in Delhi and complained that he was denied opportunities due to his caste.Vipin P Veetil, who joined the department of humanities and social sciences in March 2019, resigned on July 1 and in his resignation letter alleged that he was moving to another institution due to caste bias at IIT-Madras.“I filed a complaint last Thursday and I’ve asked for the head of the department of humanities and sciences to temporarily step down from the position until investigations are over,” Veetil said.He said that he has also applied to return to IIT-Madras. “It’s within the in lien period of one year (to withdraw resignation) so I’ve expressed interest to (re)join,” Veetil said. He added that he wanted to take the issue up so that others did not face discrimination in the institution.Veetil belongs to the other backward class community. IIT-M did not respond to requests for a comment.His resignation on July 1 triggered outrage among activists and educationists due to serious allegations of caste bias. “The discrimination came from individuals in position of power, irrespective of their claimed political affiliations and gender,” he said in his email at the time, which was leaked to reporters.In response, on July 2, IIT-Madras said, “Any complaint received by the institute from employees and students is attended to promptly through the established process of redressing grievances.” The institute, one of the country’s finest, didn’t comment on the specifics of his e-mail.Veetil has a Ph.D in Economics from the George Mason University in the US ; he was subsequently a postdoctoral fellow in Paris, according to the faculty page of IIT-Madras website. He completed his undergraduate degree from the University of Delhi in 2006.The National Commission for Backward Classes is a constitutional body and has quasi-judicial powers , similar to those of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and National Commission of Scheduled Tribes , to decide on complaints of discrimination by OBC community members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-iit-prof-moves-obc-panel-over-caste-bias-at-the-institute-101628794728149.html
13-08-2021||India||India again asks nationals to leave Afghanistan||The Indian embassy in Kabul on Thursday again advised Indians in Afghanistan to return home in view of the deteriorating security situation, saying three engineers who remained at a project site not controlled by Afghan forces had required an “emergency air rescue”. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the three engineers were at a dam site in a Taliban controlled area. Further details of the emergency air rescue, such as the area and when it was carried out, could not immediately be ascertained. The security advisory from the Indian embassy was the fourth such alert issued since June 29 and reiterated the call for Indian nationals in Afghanistan to make immediate arrangements to return home via commercial air services. It also reiterated a warning to avoid non-essential travel because of a serious threat of kidnapping. The advisory pointed to the case of the three Indian engineers and said those ignoring the embassy’s advisories were putting themselves in “mortal danger”. “A recent case that required emergency air rescue of three Indian engineers who remained at a dam project site, in an area not under the control of government forces, has brought to light that Indian nationals receiving this embassy’s advisories are not heeding its advice and continue to put themselves in mortal danger,” the alert said. The Indian embassy underscored the “need for all Indian nationals to fully adhere to steps” in previous security advisories. It also referred to the killing of photojournalist Danish Siddiqui by the Taliban in the border town of Spin Boldak on July 16 and said Indian reporters visiting Afghanistan faced additional risks. “Special attention is once again drawn to members of the Indian media arriving in Afghanistan for ground reporting. As a recent tragic incident demonstrated, the public profile of Indian journalists in Afghanistan entails additional risks,” the advisory said. The embassy advised members of the Indian media to take “additional security measures for their stay and movements inside Afghanistan, including tying up of interviews and planned coverage before arrival in Afghanistan”. Indian reporters travelling to Afghanistan should also identify well established security logistic firms who can make arrangements for their stay and movement, it added. Reports emerging after Siddiqui’s death have suggested he was captured and killed by the Taliban. According to information provided by the government in Parliament last week, there were some 1,500 Indian nationals in Afghanistan. Officials said this figure has come down as many Indians have returned in recent days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-again-asks-nationals-to-leave-afghanistan-101628794667962.html
13-08-2021||India||Merit must be the key: Justice Nariman on SC appointments||At a time when an unprecedented stalemate has prevented the Supreme Court collegium from making any appointment in the top court for 21 months, justice Rohinton F Nariman, who retired on Thursday, said that “merit must predominate” in judges’ appointments to ascertain that the people of India get quality justice.“Nobody has any legitimate expectation to come to this court. I believe there is a legitimate expectation in the people of India and the litigating public to get a certain quality of justice from this final court. For that, it is very clear merit must predominate, subject to all other factors. The merit must always come first,” justice Nariman said at an event organised by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) to bid farewell to him.The function was presided over by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, who said he felt in justice Nariman’s departure from the top court as if he was “losing one of the lions that guarded the judicial institution”.Addressing a gathering of his colleagues from the Supreme Court, and senior and junior lawyers, justice Nariman was of the view that a greater number of lawyers should be appointed as judges.“I will second Mr Vikas Singh (president of SCBA) that it is time that more direct appointees were elevated to the bench. I would also say and exhort those direct appointees, who are asked, never to say no. It is their solemn duty, having reaped so much from the profession, to give back,” emphasised the outgoing judge, who is only the fifth lawyer in Indian legal history to be directly appointed from the bar.Since the retirement of justice Ranjan Gogoi as the Chief Justice of India in November 2019, the collegium has not sent even a single recommendation to the Union government for appointments in the top court, which will have nine vacancies after justice Nariman’s exit. Additionally, justice Navin Sinha is set to retire on August 19, which will leave the Supreme Court with 10 vacancies out of 34.The previous CJI SA Bobde’s 17-month tenure turned out to be the only one in the judicial history when a CJI demitted office without making any recommendation for the Supreme Court after the advent of the collegium system in 1990s.As reported by HT on February 21, the impasse in the collegium, according to the people familiar with the development, persisted due to justice Nariman’s firm stand over recommending justice Akil A Kureshi, currently chief justice of the Tripura high court, as a judge in the apex court.Justice Nariman had asserted that any recommendation to be made by the collegium of the five most senior judges must include justice Kureshi, who stood at number 2 in all-India seniority list of high court judges. A lack of consensus within the collegium has stalled appointment of judges in the top court ever since.The standoff over justice Kureshi, HT reported at the time, may cost the country the opportunity to have its first woman CJI since it has led to uncertainty over the timely elevation of justice BV Nagarathna from the Karnataka high court, who, if elevated now, could become India’s first woman CJI in 2027.Speaking at the farewell function on Thursday, SCBA president and senior advocate Vikas Singh on Thursday said that a fitting tribute to justice Nariman by the collegium will be to elevate the outgoing judge’s picks. “I will beseech the CJI and all the judges in the collegium to ensure all the judges, he (justice Nariman) wanted appointed in the Supreme Court in his last few days, should be elevated,” said Singh.CJI Ramana paid rich tributes to justice Nariman.“It is rare to find those who stand by their principles. Brother Nariman is one of them... He has left an indelible mark on the jurisprudence of the country...Our loss will be a huge gain elsewhere. I am sure; that gain will continue to be for the larger public good,” said justice Ramana, highlighting that justice Nariman has delivered around 350 judgments in his seven years’ tenure disposed of nearly 13,565 cases.‘NOT AN EASY LIFE’Both the CJI and justice Nariman underscored that a judge’s life is not a bed of roses.“We either burn the midnight oil, or wake up before sunrise, or sometimes even both, to fulfil our judicial duties. We continue to work even during the Court holidays, do research and author pending judgments. Therefore, when false narratives are created about the supposed easy life led by judges, it is difficult to swallow,” said CJI Ramana.Justice Nariman -- his father is the eminent jurist Fali S Nariman -- emphasised that taking up judgeship after being a lawyer was not a cakewalk. “When I was at the bar, I had no idea how it would be like to be at the bench. This side (as a judge) is much more difficult than a lawyer. You have to read much, much more..I cannot say I enjoyed every minute of being a judge. It is very hard work. But I certainly enjoyed writing judgments. At the end of it all, it has worked out well,” he said.Justice Nariman also thanked attorney general KK Venugopal, whom he calls his “guru”, and in whose chamber the retiring judge had worked after he moved from Mumbai to Delhi in 1986.Justice Nariman also expressed his gratitude for former CJI RM Lodha, who had persuaded him to become a judge. “He (justice Lodha) did the greatest possible service to me by making me do a public service in turn as a judge. He said he won’t accept no. And that is how, by accident, I became a judge,” quipped justice Nariman.Justices AM Khanwilkar, L Nageswara Rao, Sanjay Kishan Kaul, BR Gavai, and V Ramasubramanian were also present at the function.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/merit-must-be-the-key-justice-nariman-on-sc-appointments-101628794609663.html
13-08-2021||India||No plan to shut embassy in Kabul: India||India on Thursday ruled out immediate closure of its embassy in Afghanistan amid the rapid deterioration of the security situation and said it continued to be engaged with all stakeholders to work for a comprehensive ceasefire and a political settlement. Rapid advances made by the Taliban in recent days, including the capture of nine provincial capitals and fresh attacks on Kandahar and Herat on Thursday, have sharpened security concerns in New Delhi. The Indian government is keeping a close eye on the situation and plans have been drawn up to deal with all contingencies, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi dismissed the possibility of any immediate closure of the Indian mission in Kabul but acknowledged that the rapidly evolving security situation across Afghanistan was “of concern”. “We are monitoring the situation very carefully but there are no plans as such [to close the embassy],” Bagchi told a regular media briefing. India evacuated some 50 officials and security officials from its consulate in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif early on Wednesday against the backdrop of Taliban fighters making rapid advances in the region. The move came exactly a month after evacuated a similar number of personnel from the consulate in southern Kandahar city. The people cited above ruled out any immediate evacuation of officials from Kabul, saying that the government was preparing for all eventualities, including the possible rapid withdrawal of diplomats and Indian nationals. According to information provided by the government in Parliament recently, some 1,500 Indians were in Afghanistan. However, the people said this figure would have come down as many Indians working on development projects had been sent back. Bagchi also pointed to the role being played in Afghanistan by terrorists and jihadi fighters from Pakistan-based groups. Recent reports have said thousand of fighters from groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan have been fighting alongside the Taliban. “Everyone in the world knows what type of role is being played and what concerns others have about jihadi and terrorist elements from Pakistan and what they have done in Afghanistan. The whole world knows it, we don’t need to tell others about it,” he said. The removal of “external malign influences” is essential for for peace in Afghanistan. “We would hope all parties, including regional countries, understand this and work towards a situation where Afghans can have a process that is owned, controlled and led by them. We certainly don’t think that’s currently the situation,” he added. Bagchi said the Indian government is also keeping a close eye on all developments regarding Afghanistan’s Hindu and Sikh minorities. “Last year, our mission in Kabul had facilitated the return of 383 members of the Sikh and Hindu communities in Afghanistan. Our mission continues to remain in touch with the Afghan Hindu and Sikh community members and we will ensure the provision of all necessary assistance to them,” he said. He declined to comment on reports about a fresh US security assessment that Kabul could fall to the Taliban within 30 to 90 days. He added: “We continue to hope that there will be an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire. We are supporting all peace initiatives in Afghanistan. Our primary concern is peace and stability in that country and offering a prosperous future [in an] independent, sovereign and democratic [country].” The external affairs ministry’s pointperson for Afghanistan, joint secretary JP Singh of the Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran desk, represented India at a regional conference hosted by Qatar in Doha on Thursday to find ways to take forward the stalled Afghan peace process. Key stakeholders from Afghanistan also joined the meeting, for which Qatari special envoy Mutlaq bin Majed Al-Qahtani extended an invitation during a visit to New Delhi last week. This was the third meeting on Afghanistan held in Doha since Tuesday, when representatives of the US, the UK, China, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Russia, the UN and the European Union met in the Qatari capital. Wednesday saw a meeting of the “extended troika” that was joined by special envoys from the US, Russia, China and Pakistan. However, the lack of consensus was evident from the fact that extended troika meeting did not produce a joint statement. The last two meetings of this group convened by Russia had resulted in such statements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-plan-to-shut-embassy-in-kabul-india-101628794488910.html
13-08-2021||India||Congress objects as Twitter locks accounts of party, key leaders||New Delhi: Nearly 5,000 twitter accounts, including those of several senior Congress leaders and the party’s official handle, were temporarily locked on Thursday after they shared a photograph of Rahul Gandhi meeting a minor rape victim’s family — his account was already locked on Saturday — even as the party mounted an attack on the Central government for scuttling free speech. The microblogging platform, however, maintains that it “impartially” enforces its rules and terms of service.Accounts of senior leaders such as Randeep Singh Surjewala, Ajay Maken, Sushmita Dev and Manickam Tagore were temporarily locked, Congress functionaries familiar with the matter said. The party’s official handle was also barred from posting, they added.The party’s social media head Rohan Gupta said “Twitter is acting under govt pressure. It has already blocked 5000 accounts of our leaders and workers across India”.“They need to understand we can’t be pressurised by Twitter or government,” he addedGupta said he has started the campaign “I too am Rahul” in light of Twitter’s action to temporarily lock the former Congress chief’s account , which he claimed was singling out Gandhi. “If a government body can post a similar picture without being actioned, then why is Rahul Gandhi being singled out?”His reference was to a post by the National Commission for Scheduled Castes wherein a similar photograph of the family was shared.The tweet in question has been withheld from public view.Twitter said that it enforces its rules judiciously and impartially. “Twitter rules are enforced judiciously and impartially for everyone on our service. We have taken proactive action on several hundred Tweets that posted an image that violated our Rules, and may continue to do so in line with our range of enforcement options,” a Twitter spokesperson said. “Certain types of private information carry higher risks than others, and our aim is always to protect individuals’ privacy and safety. We strongly encourage everyone on the service to familiarise themselves with the Twitter Rules and report anything they believe is in violation.”Twitter admitted that it was alerted by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) about the tweet which revealed the victim’s identity. It added that it reviewed the tweet against Twitter rules and policies, as well as the concerns expressed as a matter of the Indian law.The NCPCR has moved the Delhi High Court over the issue.The incident came to light on Saturday after the opposition party tweeted that the former Congress party chief had been barred from posting from his account.The Congress first said Gandhi’s account was suspended. “Shri @RahulGandhi’s Twitter account has been temporarily suspended & due process is being followed for its restoration. Until then, he will stay connected with you all through his other SM platforms & continue to raise his voice for our people & fight for their cause. Jai Hind,” Congress’ official handle posted on the microblogging website on date.It later clarified that the account was temporarily locked.When an account is locked, under Twitter’s enforcement guidelines, the account holder is barred from posting any new updates. To unlock the account, the post in question needs to be deleted.NCPCR asked the Delhi Police and Twitter last Wednesday to take action against Gandhi over a photograph he posted after meeting the family of the nine-year-old girl who was raped and killed.The child rights body said the tweet violated the Juvenile Justice Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. Gandhi met the girl’s family last week and assured his support. “Parents’ tears are saying only one thing -- their daughter, the daughter of this country, deserves justice. And I am with them on this path to justice,” Gandhi tweeted in Hindi and posted the photo of his meeting with the girl’s relatives.Twitter has taken down the post. “When we determine that a Tweet violated the Twitter Rules, we require the violator to remove it before they can Tweet again. We send an email notification to the violator identifying the Tweet(s) in violation and which policies have been violated. They will then need to go through the process of removing the violating Tweet or appealing our review if they believe we made an error,” the enforcement page states.Experts on the subject are split, with some arguing that Gandhi’s tweet is in violation of Indian law and Twitter’s actions are justified. Kazim Rizvi, founder of the policy think tank The Dialogue, said that Gandhi’s tweet violates Section 23 (2) of POCSO Act and Section 74 of Juvenile Justice Act, which outlaws the disclosure of any sensitive information about child victim of rape. “This law has been reinforced by Justice Deepak Gupta of the Supreme Court in Nipun Saxena vs Union of India wherein the court provided exhaustive guidleines to prohibit disclosure of personal information regarding a rape victim including those who are deceased in order to protect their dignity,” he said. “Posting pictures with the family of a rape victim poses concerns regarding the safety and security of the family. This is violative of both the terms of service of platforms and also the global best practices on Platform Regulation. Towards this, the action by Twitter is in accordance with the Indian laws and its own Rules.”Rizvi added that the accounts have only been temporarily locked, and not suspended, as per Twitter’s rules. “It requires the account holders to remove the violative Tweet. Once the tweet is deleted, the account is reinstated,” he said.Supreme Court lawyer Sourav Roy said that one has to take cognizance of the context of the tweet. “It is important to highlight the plight of a victim’s family,” he said. “This is minor Dalit girl and the police were harassing victim’s family. If Gandhi’s visit aimed to highlight the plight of the victim then there is no hard and fast rule that he should not be allowed to post such a photograph. One has to understand the law and not just follow it blindly.”Roy added that Gandhi’s tweet in no way attempted to jeopardize the family of the victim. “The larger question that needs to be addressed here is whether companies like Twitter should be allowed to wield so much power.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-objects-as-twitter-locks-accounts-of-party-key-leaders-101628794487739.html
13-08-2021||India||DNA analysis, camera trapping for new elephant census||India will embark on a first scientific estimation of its elephant population next year, using DNA analysis of dung samples, camera trapping, and statistical modelling, following a process similar to that used in the quadrennial tiger count. India does have an elephant census, but this is largely a headcount of elephants in various elephant habitats conducted by state forest departments. The last one was carried out in 2017 and concluded that India has at least 27,000 elephants. “Head count is not a scientific method for population estimation. We have realised that we can conduct a very scientific population estimation if we followed estimation methods used for tigers and leopards. So now we will apply a statistical framework and conduct double sampling. First ground surveys will be conducted, indirect elephant signs will be recorded like broken branches, footprints, dung etc. Camera trapping will also be conducted along with DNA analysis of dung samples. Then the numbers will be extrapolated to give a range for each region. Such a scientific method will definitely improve our understanding of elephants and the issues facing them,” said SP Yadav, member secretary, National Tiger Conservation Authority and head of Central Zoo Authority.According to the new estimation methodology released on Thursday on the occasion of World Elephant Day, the process “involves rigorous statistical analyses of ground data on animal signs, human impacts, habitat attributes and absolute density”. The methodology adds that the process will involve three phases: ground surveys, analyses of remotely sensed data and camera traps. “Elephant populations using this method will be assessed for first time. The procedure is routinely used for estimating tiger and leopard populations in India.”The 2017 elephant census results revealed that the distribution range of elephants in the country had expanded and many states that never had any elephants were recording elephant presence. Elephant populations were reported for the first time from Manipur, Mizoram, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Andaman and Nicobar.“We know that the distribution is expanding. There are 40 to 50 elephants in Madhya Pradesh which never had elephants. Chhattisgarh also has a sizeable number of resident elephants now which possibly moved from neighbouring Jharkhand. Elephants may be moving to new areas under stress or because they are being driven out by people,” explained Yadav adding that these trends will also be studied. “Elephants are like engineers of the jungle. They manipulate habitat, pulverise soil which helps the forest ecology.” “There has been a need to harmonise population estimation methods along more scientific lines. The @moefcc for the first time is converging elephant & tiger population estimation. On #WorldElephantDay, released the protocol for the exercise,” Bhupender Yadav, union environment minister tweeted.Asian elephants are listed as “Endangered” on the IUCN Red List of threatened species. That’s because most states except India, have lost their viable elephant populations due to loss of habitat and poaching. The current population estimates indicate that there are about 50,000 -60000 Asian elephants in the world. More than 60 % of the population is held in India.In 2020, 87 elephants and 359 people died in human-elephant conflicts; the corresponding numbers for 2019-20 were 19 elephants and 585 people according to MoEFCC’s reply to a question raised in the Rajya Sabha last week on human-elephant conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dna-analysis-camera-trapping-for-new-elephant-census-101628794308310.html
13-08-2021||India||Om Birla: ‘Can’t impose any debate on the House’||Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla spoke to Hindustan Times about Parliament’s curtailed monsoon session, the disruption in the House, the passage of bills without debate, the demands for a discussion on the Pegasus list, the allegation by Opposition leaders that Lok Sabha TV was blacking them out, and other issues related to the session .Edited excerpts:The previous sessions under your tenure as the Speaker logged 100% productivity. But in the monsoon session, the House could use only 22% of its time. In the last five sessions, the House ran well, and the MPs fulfilled their responsibilities. Earlier, efforts were made to run the House smoothly, and that’s why the House ran for long, even till midnight. But, in this session, the deadlock continued. The Opposition made some specific demands, while the government maintained that we should first discuss the issues identified during the all-party meeting (held on July 18 when the Pegasus controversy broke). So, a consensus couldn’t be reached on the business. I tried my best and repeatedly appealed to both sides that the House is meant to debate and discuss issues. But, despite my efforts, deadlock continued.People had started believing that the Lok Sabha is the place where public issues are discussed. A positive image of India’s democratic institutions had started building as Parliament also acts as a margdarshak (guide) to other democratic institutions.Who is responsible for the deadlock? How can I hold someone responsible? If both ruling and Opposition sides agree on an issue, the House can run. If they don’t agree, a deadlock will continue. Lawmakers can adopt many ways to express their dissent. But showing placards, shouting slogans, coming down in the Well of the House, are not in the best traditions of the House, and therefore, not acceptable. I will talk to all party leaders, and I am hopeful that the parties will also do self-introspection.The logjam could have ended with a debate on the Pegasus issue.It’s between the government and the Opposition. They couldn’t agree. As the Speaker, I can’t impose any debate on the House.Several bills were being passed without any discussion. Do you think it is the right way to conduct legislative business? I always favour that every bill is debated in the House before passage. But despite every effort, debate couldn’t take place as the House was not in order. But it would have been better if discussion had happened.Opposition has alleged that Lok Sabha TV didn’t show their speeches or visuals, and it was almost like a blackout. Lok Sabha TV or any other channel shows every speaker when the House is in order. I don’t think that even during earlier times, the Well of the House was shown during the proceedings. LSTV works when the House is in order. But, during disruption, LSTV possibly tries to focus on a lawmaker who is speaking on the agenda. I have not given any direction to LSTV on who should be shown or not. That’s not my job. I have not told them that you can’t show lawmakers in the Well or black out someone else. This is decided by the Lok Sabha TV according to the decorum or rules of the House.In this session, all bills, except the Constitution amendment bill were passed amid din. Is it a new normal in the House that bills would continue to be cleared even amid din, and when the House is not in order? Our job is pass the bills after debate. But sometimes, due to deadlock, debate can’t take place. If I am able to conduct a debate on the bill, I will definitely do it. But, at times, debate can’t take place but the minister may insist that the bill be passed. As the Speaker of the House, I have to allow the passage of the bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/om-birla-interview-can-t-impose-any-debate-on-the-house-101628794129774.html

They used unacceptable force and physically manhandled members of Parliament, including women members,” he said in a letter given to Naidu.Describing the developments as “a shocking, unprecedented insult” to Indian democracy and dignity of the Rajya Sabha, the Opposition MPs alleged that they were “prevented from registering their protest” against the bill.Naidu told the opposition leaders that he was “deeply hurt” by the incidents in the House on August 10 and cautioned that “such unruly behaviour by some members is not pardonable and necessary action needs to be taken against such erring members”, according to a senior leader.“He even expressed concern over even the Chairman not being allowed to make some important observations,” said a second functionary.The Rajya Sabha secretariat deployed 42 marshals from both Houses of Parliament in the chamber on Wednesday evening, when furious Opposition leaders stormed the Well and protested against the passage of the general insurance bill.After the Opposition allegations, Naidu summoned officials on Thursday. “The officials reported that no outsiders were deployed as martials in the Rajya Sabha on August 10,” said an official release.“They stated that only the watch and ward staff of the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha secretariats was deployed, which is permitted, based on the need. They also informed that only 14 martials were deployed to started with and was gradually scaled up to 42, based on the situation in the House and in view of the incidents in the House on previous days,” the release said.Opposition parties also staged a protest match to Vijay Chowk and later issued a joint statement accusing the government of deliberately derailing Parliament.“The Parliament session is over. Frankly, as far as 60% of the country is concerned, there has been no Parliament session because the voice of 60% of this country has been crushed, humiliated and yesterday in the Rajya Sabha (the MPs were) physically beaten,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged.In a separate development, Sonia Gandhi called a virtual meeting with top Opposition leaders on August 20.A senior Congress leader said the meeting was aimed to take forward the new-found unity between many Opposition parties during the parliament session. The leaders will discuss the current political scenario and come out with a joint statement.The Congress leader pointed out that West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had also indicated that Opposition parties would meet again after the session is over. The meeting is expected to discuss the Pegasus row, price rise and other related political issues.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut confirmed the meeting. “Maharashtra chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray) too will participate in it,” he said.Banerjee was yet to take a decision, a Trinamool Congress MP said. “We cannot say anything without holding a meeting with Banerjee,” he said.Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam MP TKS Elangovan said issued related to Parliament will be taken up at the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-calls-on-naidu-over-govt-action-sonia-plans-meet-with-top-leaders-101628793949433.html
13-08-2021||India||Papers torn, ministers blocked, marshal targeted: Rajya Sabha report||Opposition MPs tore papers, obstructed ministers from taking their seats, choked and suffocated one marshal, dragged and pushed another, took videos and even climbed on a LED TV stand, according to a report by the Rajya Sabha secretariat on the pandemonium that rocked the Upper House in the final hours of the disruption-hit monsoon session.The Opposition denied these contentions, and blamed the government for the unruly scenes in the House, which, they said, were sparked by “outsiders” acting as marshals.According to the report, submitted to Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday, the trouble started at 6.02pm with Trinamool Congress MP Dola Sen allegedly making a noose out of scarf and putting it around the neck of her party colleague Shanta Chhetri, purportedly shouting slogans.The report alleged that as Opposition leaders rushed to the Well, Congress member Phulo Devi Netam and Chhaya Verma allegedly started tearing papers and throwing them towards the table of the House, four minutes later.At 6.10pm, Communist Party of India leader Binoy Viswam and Communist Party of India-Marxist’s Elamaram Kareem allegedly snatched papers and folders kept on the Table of the House. Soon, Rajmani Patel of the Congress and Anil Desai of the Shiv Sena allegedly joined them, the report added.Opposition parties rejected the charges with the Congress saying that the developments in the Rajya Sabha were “unprecedented, shocking and an assault on the very dignity of the Rajya Sabha”.“There was no provocation from any opposition member and including women members, who were manhandled and they fell down,” said Congress leader Anand Sharma.“I don’t believe any Rajya Sabha report. They are trying to deflect attention.,” Trinamool Congress member Derek O’Brien told news channel NDTV.The report, a copy of which was accessed by HT, said that when the House met after a short break, Akhilesh Prasad Singh of the Congress was making videos.According to the report, at 6.22pm , Sen obstructed “the way of Piyush Goyal (leader of the House) and Pralhad Joshi (minister of parliamentary affairs) coming from the chairman’s chamber to take their respective seats in the House.”“They were also being pushed by her,” the report added.“Sen also argued and pushed lady officials of Parliament Security Service. Opposition MPs Syed Nasir Hussain, Arpita Ghosh, and Priyanka Chaturvedi tore papers and threw those towards the secretariat’s Table,” the report said.The report said that at 6.29pm, Congress MP Syed Nasir Hussain “first pushed (Shiv Sena’s) Sanjay Raut towards security officials cordoning the ‘Table of the House’ and subsequently pulled him back. They were joined by other MPs viz. Elamaram Kareem (CPM), Ripun Bora (Congress), Binoy Viswam and Congress MP Akhilesh Prasad Singh.”“Ripun Bora climbed on the LED TV stand installed on the left side of the Chair. Elamaram Kareem manhandled and severely choked the neck of one male marshal and dragged him in order to break the security cordon,” the report said.“One lady marshal was pulled and dragged by Phulodevi Netam and Chhaya Verma and assaulted in the Well of the House. Syed Nasir Hussain and Sh. Elamaram Kareem caught hold of shoulder of one male marshal (Security official from PSS/RSS) and tried to drag him out of the security cordon, who was trying to protect the lady Marshal as mentioned above,” the report added.The report came amid bitter exchanges between the government and Opposition over ugly scenes that played out in the House of Elders in its final hours on Wednesday.As the government sought to push the insurance amendment bill, Opposition members demanded it be sent to a select committee. Some Opposition members clashed with marshals, tore papers, flung files and climbed atop tables to shout slogans denouncing the government.The government released visuals and claimed Opposition members pushed and shoved the marshals but the Opposition said the marshals manhandled two women members.On Thursday evening, Naidu and Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla met to discuss the disruption-hit session.“Both the presiding officers opined that such persistent disruptions in defiance of repeated appeals from the Chair and in violation of the rules of procedure have dented the dignity and stature of the highest legislature of the country and need to be taken a serious view of. They have decided to undertake a detailed examination of such unruly scenes in the past and action taken for deciding on the future course of action in such cases,” said a person with knowledge of developments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/papers-torn-ministers-blocked-marshal-targeted-rajya-sabha-report-101628793767973.html
13-08-2021||India||Government, Opposition spar outside House over chaos inside||The Union government on Thursday launched a broadside against the Opposition over disruptions in Parliament and fielded eight ministers to argue that protests were orchestrated to derail proceedings, prompting angry rebuttals from the Opposition as acrimony that characterised the just-concluded monsoon session spilled outside the House.The government urged Rajya Sabha chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu to set up a special committee to probe allegations that some Opposition members manhandled security staff and damaged House property and demanded action against those found guilty of violating norms and decorum.“…We were threatened, that if you attempt to pass more bills [after a bill restoring states’ rights to identify other backward classes (OBC)] then more disastrous situation is going to happen. In unambiguous terms it was told to us,” said Union minister for parliamentary affairs Pralhad Joshi, arguing that raucous protests by the Opposition forced the government to cut short the session.In response, Opposition members said the government stonewalled their demands, muzzled their voice inside Parliament, and violated House norms by rushing bills without debate. Opposition members protested outside the House, and met Naidu to lodge their objections to the government’s conduct.“They don’t let us talk in Parliament. Yesterday, for the first time in the history of our country, members of the Rajya Sabha were manhandled and physically beaten. This was nothing short of murder of democracy,” said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.In an unprecedented move, eight Union ministers were deployed to list the outreach efforts made by the government to break the deadlock with the Opposition. The government asserted that it was willing to be accommodative regarding discussions, but that the Opposition was not interested.“From the first day, even at the all-party meeting chaired by the Prime Minister, there were indications that the Opposition will not allow the House to run. It was made clear by the Trinamool Congress and the Congress who said this session will be a washout,” Joshi said.He was flanked by commerce minister Piyush Goyal, labour minister Bhupender Yadav, education minister Dharmendra Pradhan, minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, junior foreign minister V Muraleedharan, information and technology minister Anurag Thakur and junior parliamentary minister Arjun Ram Meghwal.Joshi said senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders reached out to the Opposition with a request that, at least on the opening day, they should allow the ministers to be introduced. “…That was also not allowed,” he said, alleging that the disruption was orchestrated and pre-planned.The Opposition trained its guns on the government for rushing bills without any debate or discussion, and also sidestepping scrutiny by parliamentary committees.“The government may claim that they have passed so many laws, but was that democratic? Was there discussion? Was there a consensus on the passage of those laws, the answer is No,” said Congress leader Anand Sharma. “We remain committed to continue our fight...” he said, following a meeting of Opposition leaders with Naidu.
13-08-2021||India||Bihar to ramp up oxygen generation, storage by August 31||Bihar is expected to generate 117 metric tonnes of medical oxygen daily by August 31 and ramp up its storage capacity to 310-kilo litre in anticipation of a possible third Covid-19 wave, said state health minister Mangal Pandey.Each of the 10 state-run medical colleges will have at least one Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plant depending on their requirement.“As many as 34 of the 122 PSA oxygen plants have been made operational,” said Pratyaya Amrit, additional chief secretary, health. “Sixteen others have reached the installation site while another 27 are on the way.’Sixty-two oxygen plants were being set up under the PM CARES Fund, nine by the Union petroleum ministry and the remaining 51 by the state government, said Pandey.Cryogenic liquid medical oxygen tanks were also being set up for storage purposes at the 10 state-run medical colleges.The state health minister has said the availability of oxygen was the biggest challenge during the second wave of the pandemic even as he claimed that no deaths were reported due to lack of oxygen in the state.He said the daily requirement of medical oxygen in the state went up 14 times from 16 metric tonnes during the first week of April to 232 MT in the next 20-25 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-to-ramp-up-oxygen-generation-storage-by-august-31-101628762554630.html
13-08-2021||India||Nagaland again opts for an Opposition-less government||The ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a major ally of the government, and the opposition Naga People’s Front (NPF) agreed in principle to form an opposition-less “Nagaland United Government” along with two Independent legislators on Wednesday, people familiar with the matter said.The decision was taken in a meeting held at the residential office of chief minister Neiphiu Rio with representatives of all political parties involved.When asked about the new development, state BJP president Temjen Imna Along said “we are in positive consultation” without divulging further details.On July 19, the NPF had passed a resolution for an all-party government and endorsed it to the chief minister for necessary consideration in the interest of the Naga political solution.Although Nagaland’s legislators are not directly involved in the peace talks, subsequent elected members, across party lines, over the years have held ground that they would play a facilitating role for settlement of the Indo-Naga issue.This is not the first time that the state is going to have an opposition-less government. During the third tenure of the NPF-led Democratic Alliance of Nagaland in 2015, Congress MLAs had joined the government and subsequently merged with the ruling NPF.However, this time the NPF MLAs asserted that they would not merge with any party. “We are talking about an all-party government, a coalition, where we will maintain our respective party ideologies,” a senior NPF legislator said, wishing not to be named.Recently, the Nagaland government had formed a parliamentary committee comprising all 60 members of the Nagaland Legislative Assembly and two MPs, led by chief minister Rio, deputy chief minister Y Patton and opposition leader TR Zeliang to act as facilitators in the ongoing peace talks between the Centre and Naga armed groups.On August 3, the assembly passed a resolution, appealing to all Naga political groups to unite to expedite the peace process while urging negotiating parties of the Indo-Naga political issue to resume talks with a positive approach.The Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN-IM) had entered into a ceasefire agreement with the government of India in 1997 and the two have been holding political dialogues since then, while a conglomeration of seven different Naga national political groups (NNPGs) also got into separate talks with the Centre in 2017.The Centre signed a “framework agreement” with NSCN (IM) in 2015, and an “agreed position” with the NNPGs in 2017.While it is largely claimed that negotiations have concluded, the NSCN (IM)’s demand for a separate Naga flag and constitution has been a delaying factor in signing a final deal on the Naga peace process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-oppn-ruling-pda-to-come-together-for-united-government-101628749653723.html
13-08-2021||India||Kinnaur landslide: 14 bodies found so far, 26 feared trapped||Wreckage of the bus carrying 22 passengers that was buried under a landslide in Negulsari in Kinnaur district, 210km from Shimla, was found 70 metres down the National Highway 5 on Thursday morning, superintendent of police Kinnaur Sarju Ram Rana said, as the death toll in the incident rose to 14 with the recovery of four more bodies.The rescue operations that were halted on Wednesday night resumed at the break of dawn. “The bus (probably hit by the big boulders) slid down hill with the debris,” said Rana. About a 70-metre stretch of the highway was blocked by debris. The road was reopened for traffic on Wednesday night. There were about 300 vehicles stranded on the both sides. “Three bodies of passengers were recovered from the wreckage in morning. Until last night, 10 bodies were retrieved from the wreckage till suspension of rescue operations,” Rana said.Teams from Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Army and Himachal Pradesh police are carrying out rescue operations, said Sudesh Mokta, director of state disaster management authority, adding 37 personnel from the national disaster response force joined the rescue operations. A total of 16 people are still missing, Himachal Pradesh chief minister Jai Ram Thakur told the state assembly after returning from the landslide site near Chaura village on the National Highway 5 in Kinnaur district.One Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) bus which was en route from Reckong Peo to Haridwar, one car, one Tata Sumo and one truck were found buried under the debris. Rescue teams retrieved eight bodies from the Tata Sumo. One Bolero vehicle and its passengers are still untraceable. “There were about 22 passengers in the bus when it got buried,” said HRTC managing director Sandeep Kumar. Both driver and conductor had alighted the vehicle to inquire about the road condition and when they turned back the bus was buried under debris,” he said. “Both are in a state of shock,” he said. The truck, hit by boulders had slid to the river side; and the body of the driver was recovered Wednesday yesterday evening. The wreckage of the bus was traced at 8.15am on Thursday.Kinnaur deputy commissioner Abid Hussain Sadiq said four more bodies were recovered from the spot on Thursday, adding that 14 bodies have been recovered so far.CM Thakur said the state government will provide ₹4 lakh each to the next of kin of the dead and ₹50,000 to those seriously injured. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind expressed grief over the deaths, he added.With agency inputs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kinnaur-landslide-body-count-rises-to-13-rescue-ops-continue-101628742153622.html
13-08-2021||India||Isro’s satellite launch fails due to technical glitch||The launch of earth observation satellite EOS-03, aboard the Indian Space Research Organisation ’s (Isro) heavy launch vehicle GSLV, was unsuccessful on Thursday morning when the third stage of the engine did not ignite.The satellite was meant to be the Indian space agency’s first launch in four months but had been lost, officials aware of the matter said. Had this mission been successful, it would have provided a picture of India’s landmass every 30 minutes for the next ten years.“Performance of first and second stages was normal. However, Cryogenic Upper Stage ignition did not happen due to technical anomaly. The mission couldn’t be accomplished as intended,” said a statement from the Indian Space Research Organisation.The failure also represented a setback for what is a crucial part of the space agency’s future rocket engine design using cryogenic propulsion, which is far more complex than solid or liquid systems, but offers significant advantages in thrust and efficiency. The Indian space agency has more or less perfected the science around the solid and liquid propulsion systems, which are in use in the PSLV rockets known as Isro’s workhorse launchers.The mission using the heavy launch vehicle GSLV lifted off from the country’s only spaceport at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh at the scheduled at 5:43 am on Thursday, which was also the birth anniversary of isro’s first chairperson Dr Vikram Sarabhai.But the mission ran into trouble at four minutes, 56 seconds after launch when the third stage of the rocket was to ignite. There was silence in the mission control well into the seventh minute after the launch while scientists analysed why the launch vehicle deviated from the charted course, a person aware of what happened at mission control said.“The outcome of the mission will be announced by ISRO soon. Right now in the mission control, senior scientists are in discussion regarding the performance of the flight,” said an announcement. Later, ISRO chairperson Dr K Sivan announced, “The EOS 3 mission could not be fully accomplished mainly because of a technical anomaly observed in cryogenic stage.”The mission was significant since this was the first time ISRO was to place an earth observation satellite in a geo-stationary orbit (where the satellite can image the same region throughout the day) instead of a polar orbit that it usually uses. The EOS 3 would have beamed continuous image from over the country, making it an eye in the sky with uses such as in disaster management.The mission was delayed twice – once in March 2020 when the space agency said that there were technical glitches, and then again in March this year when the second wave of the pandemic hit. This was the second launch of 2021, the previous being a commercial PSLV launch carrying aboard Brazil’s earth observation satellite Amazonia 1.The Union minister for state for the department of space Dr Jitendra Singh said in a tweet said, “Spoke to Chairman #ISRO, Dr K.Sivan and discussed in detail. The first two stages went off fine, only after that there was a difficulty in cryogenic upper stage ignition. The mission can be re-scheduled some time again.”The space agency did not clarify whether the minister was referring to the paired satellite or whether the space agency had a backup satellite that could be launched soon.Experts said the glitch could not have been a major one. “The GSLV has been successfully tested so it is unlikely to be a design flaw. Any major glitch would have been caught during flight countdown like we saw in the case of Chandrayaan-2. It might have been a small problem; it was just unlucky for ISRO,” said Ajay Lele, Senior Fellow working with space security and strategic technologies at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.The Chandrayaan-2 launch was aborted with less than an hour to go because of a faulty nipple in the cryogenic engine that led to leakage of helium used to pressurise the fuel.This was, however, the first time the space agency was using a 4-metre ogive or bullet-like shaped payload fairing (the portion up top where the satellite is placed). The same shaped payload fairing is likely to be used for the human spaceflight mission, albeit with a different launch vehicle – the GSLV Mk III. This launch vehicle has proved successful with one sub-orbital flight, two successful developmental flight, and the first operational flight during which it carried Chandrayaan-2 mission.This was first major failure of the GSLV vehicle since 2010, when two consecutive malfunctions took place, earning the rocket the epithet “naughty boy”. For ISRO, this was the only launch failure since the 2017 PSLV launch when a heat shield that protects the satellite within did not separate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mission-unsuccessful-cryogenic-stage-of-isro-s-gslv-f10-fails-to-ignite-101628737713176.html

13-08-2021||Today's||In India, a diminished economic future||Recently published data on key indicators of the Indian economy are a sobering reminder of the diminishing economic future that most Indians confront and the stubborn refusal, indeed abdication, by our policymakers, to craft an appropriate policy response.In late July, the government released estimates from the third annual round of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), conducted between July 2019 and June 2020. One of the starkest revelations from the survey is that India witnessed an unprecedented, sharp increase in the share of workers employed in agriculture from 42.5% in 2018-19 to 45.6% in 2019-20. In a sharp reversal of structural economic trends, agriculture was the biggest employer responsible for creating 32.72 million jobs.This was accompanied by a fall in the share of manufacturing, construction, transport and “other services” in total employment.That this shift to agriculture is a sign of deep distress and employment of last resort is evident in Santosh Mehrotra’s analysis of poverty incidence using PLFS data. Mehrotra’s calculations reveal that between 2011-12 and 2019-20, the absolute number of poor increased by 70 million.It is important to note that PLFS data only captures the first three months (April-June) of the pandemic-induced economic shock. As Mahesh Vyas points out, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) data shows that this “reverse migration” to agriculture has, in fact, deepened through 2020-21 (July-June). In the first wave, the worst impact of “reverse migration” was partially mitigated by the relative resilience of agriculture, which grew by 3.6%, the only sector of the economy to do so. In addition, welfare spending in rural India through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), in particular, was ramped up and provided some minimal succour.But these conditions do not prevail today, in the aftermath of the deadly second wave.First, the monsoon conditions have not been as favourable. Second, and more importantly, government welfare spending has been stubbornly low.Central government spending in key sectors such as rural development (MGNREGS) in the first quarter (April-June) of 2021 is far lower than last year, leaving the rural workforce vulnerable. In June 2021, for instance, MGNREGS provided nearly 10 million fewer jobs than in June 2020, meeting apromixately 83% of the demand for jobs compared with 87% in the previous year. The refusal to ramp up spending, despite the deadly second wave, has likely left households in deeper economic distress. Agricultural wages may not remain resilient as they did in 2020, making the need for more government spending in rural India urgent.Perhaps policymakers have chosen to ignore these vulnerabilities because the formal sector of the economy is showing signs of recovery, in turn, filling the central government’s coffers. The Centre’s revenue receipts and fiscal deficit numbers for the first quarter of this year are looking better than 2019. Overall, it collected 27% of its budgeted receipts in June 2021 compared with 14% in 2019. Of course, part of this is due to the bonanza from excise collections on petrol and diesel.Significantly, corporate tax collections were a healthy ₹1.23 lakh crore. Healthy corporate taxes underscore the reality that like last year, economic recovery, such as it is, is profit-led. And while this may offer some short-term comfort to those tracking Gross Domestic Product (GDP) numbers, not only does this expose the bulk of the economy to prolonged vulnerability, this will only deepen the structural crisis highlighted by PLFS.As HSBC’s Pranjul Bhandari has repeatedly pointed out, gains to the formal sector post the pandemic have come at the cost of putting small, informal firms out of business. And while this “forced formalisation” has kept profitability high, it has left the bulk of India’s households, which find employment in the informal sector, financially vulnerable.That households are vulnerable is also reflected in the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s consumer confidence surveys and points to the deepening demand crisis. The latest survey for July 2021 showed persistent weakness in consumer confidence as most households reported lower incomes than a year ago. If unchecked, the likelihood of the “reverse migration” trend becoming an endemic feature of the economy is real. In the short-run, the policy prescriptions are well known and have been widely discussed in the public domain. A consumption boost through food, work (MGNREGS), and cash transfers in urban India remain essential for relief today than in the peak lockdown last year. The government’s continued refusal to provide a robust stimulus, beyond an expanded public distribution system, despite some fiscal elbow room with relatively healthy revenue receipts and a fiscal deficit under control, is inexcusable, even callous.However, the long-term challenge for India remains finding its way toward an employment-intensive growth trajectory. This will require more than the current policy toolkit of extended credit guarantees and bulldozing reforms, as was attempted through farm laws. Perhaps it is worth acknowledging that there are no clear pathways. From factor market reforms, to understanding and responding to the unique supply constraints, including difficulties that confront the female labour force, to overcoming barriers to scale experienced by small and medium enterprises, each of these challenges requires careful deliberation and coordinated policy action between sectors of the economy and between the Centre and state governments. Employment-intensive growth needs State investment in human capital, in markets and in enabling regulation. But first, and above all, the government needs to acknowledge the deep structural crisis that it is staring at.Yamini Aiyar is president and chief executive of the Centre for Policy Research The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-india-a-diminished-economic-future-101628857385200.html
13-08-2021||Today's||To save Afghanistan, act against Pakistan||United States (US) president Joe Biden is pressing ahead with his dash out of Afghanistan, undeterred by the catastrophe he is leaving behind. He does not regret it, he told reporters earlier this week.Perhaps he does now. The Taliban has gained control of vast swathes at a speed that has startled military leaders and officials of the Biden administration. Before long, they will have Kabul. And the medieval barbarism that characterised their 1996-2001 Islamic Emirate may be back in all its horrific manifestations — women behind burqas, petty thieves and adulterers stoned, monuments blown up.Former and current military leaders, and experts on the region and officials point to one factor in all this that could make a difference, if tackled in time — Pakistan. The key to the Taliban surviving 20 years after its ouster, and recent resurgence, has been safe havens across the border in Pakistan.Also Read | UNSC: Reading India’s global signals rightDavid Petraeus, onetime US military commander in Afghanistan, vented his frustration in an interview to TRT Word, a Turkish TV network. “The Taliban, the Haqqani Network (which is a part of the Taliban), the Islamic movement of Uzbekistan, all the different groups making life so difficult for Afghanistan over the years, all have their headquarters on Pakistani soil. And there was no willingness on the part of the Pakistanis to eliminate those headquarters from their soil. So you could never put ultimate pressure on their leaders, on their major headquarters.” His point was simple. There was a military solution to the Afghan problem, but the chase always ended at the border with Pakistan.Pakistan’s role goes beyond giving sanctuary to the Taliban. When asked if the Taliban could have managed their recent military successes without Pakistan’s help at a news conference, John Kirby, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, could barely retain his trademark equanimity: “I – I’m – I – again, I’m not going to – I – I can’t assess the – the – the Taliban order of battle … I – I – I – I won’t speculate about what manner of support they’re getting from any other nation state or any other source.” Kirby was being careful to not give Pakistan an excuse to play difficult.The US is having “frank” conversations with the Pakistanis at this time but there is no evidence they are yielding anything of consequence. US defense secretary Lloyd Austin spoke to Pakistan army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa earlier this week, but it may already be too late.Biden may be determined to let the Afghans decide their destiny, decide who they want to govern their country and how. But does he really see Pakistani as part of that self-determination process?There may still be time, therefore, for one last, albeit, desperate measure. Threaten Pakistan with punishment, any punishment, to force it to cut ties with the Taliban. Chris Alexander, a former Canadian minister, and others, have demanded sanctions, which has been gathering momentum on Twitter with #SanctionPakistan.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/to-save-afghanistan-act-against-pakistan-101628853474314.html
13-08-2021||Today's||UNSC: Reading India’s global signals right||Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi presiding over a virtual Security Council debate — a first for any Indian PM — is a sign of a new, more assertive Indian willingness to contribute positively to global peace and security issues at the highest political level. The external affairs minister (EAM)’s decision to preside over “in-person” meetings of the Council reinforce the thinking that this is not a one-off effort. The signals are consistent.India’s engagement with the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has a chequered history. It can be traced back to 1947. Soon after Independence, we failed in our first attempt to get elected to the SC as a non-permanent member.Subsequently, it is well-known that we have been elected to the SC eight times. Of these, seven times were when there was no candidate in the race against us. What is not widely known is that even after 1947, we lost two of the three attempts to get on the SC in contested elections. In four contested elections to the SC, we lost thrice in the first 50 years of our Independence. Additionally, our experience of the Council’s consideration of the India-Pakistan question in the first two decades of our independent existence left us reticent about involvement with the SC.Also Read | 1971: When Delhi and Moscow came togetherThis was many years ago. Yet, the scars of the past often get embedded in collective memories and take time to overcome. It appears that change is happening. In recent times, our approach towards engaging global organisations in matters of peace and security is evolving.In 2017, reversing years of caution, India moved the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It leveraged a multilateral convention to seek settlement of a dispute about the judgment of a Pakistani military court to execute Indian national, Kulbhushan Jadhav. What was anathema, until then, ended in success.Later in 2017, though not a member of the SC, India did not shy away from facing a permanent member of the Council in an election to the ICJ. It remained undeterred when all permanent members supported their fellow permanent member. The Indian win upended a tradition that no nominee of a permanent member to the ICJ had ever lost an election.In 2019, India was able to ward off another permanent member which ventured to team up with Pakistan to revive a matter that others in the Council concluded did not belong there. Not only did it end in a diplomatic win, but it also resulted in a public diplomacy win. These were indications of change in the making.This month, the Indian presidency of the Council adds further impetus to that trend. The presidency of the SC is a matter of routine alphabetical rotation. We have presided numerous times. Something is different now. India is using the pulpit to indicate that its agenda is no longer defensive. India is not satisfied with merely ensuring that matters of immediate concern are kept out despite the efforts of those inimical to us. The intent is to highlight the positive agenda that India can bring to the table, and it is gaining attention.Interestingly, India, which generally is averse to the pursuit of thematic items by the SC, has brought such an issue to the fore. It is correct that the Council has addressed various aspects of maritime security; however, it did not consider maritime security holistically earlier. Also, for the first time, a formal statement was adopted by the SC on the subject. Nevertheless, the argument that this is under a general rubric and may not be pursued by others is not invalid.In evaluating technicalities, we tend to lose the broader political significance. The subject is important, as is the format and the outcome. More significant is that India’s political leadership is showing that it is keenly invested in serious engagement at the UN. It is confidently floating global initiatives at a forum where our high-level engagement was limited.The only instance of our participation at the SC, at the highest level, goes back to the First Security Council Summit presided by the then United Kingdom Prime Minister (PM), John Major, in 1992. India, then a non-permanent member, was represented by PM PV Narasimha Rao. SC meetings presided by heads of State/government in any format are rare. Many times, the outcomes do not stand the test of time. However, that is not necessarily the intent. The 1992 Summit signalled the beginning of an era of global cooperation in the SC, following the end of the Cold War.PM Narendra Modi presiding over a virtual SC debate — a first for any Indian PM — is a sign of a new, more assertive Indian willingness to contribute positively to global peace and security issues at the highest political level. The external affairs minister (EAM)’s decision to preside over “in-person” meetings of the Council reinforce the thinking that this is not a one-off effort. The signals are consistent.The longer-term significance is of an Indian political leadership invested in UN issues. Again, this is not entirely new. There are instances in the past of Indian political leaders taking initiatives in matters such as environment, the climate crisis and nuclear issues. That the current political leadership is willing to stake out new areas reflects intent to expand the canvas of India’s foreign policy. Expanding our objectives is to be welcomed. The choice of the forum means we are ready to exorcise the ghosts of the past.Those who think activism as a non-permanent member undermines our quest for permanent membership need to remember that good performance is usually a means of moving up the ladder, not a demonstration of intent to stay stationary. Alas, the toxicity of India’s domestic politics results in foreign policy being viewed through a partisan prism. Consequently, the contours of beneficial change, even though discernible, are missed.Syed Akbaruddin is a retired Indian diplomat who served as India’s permanent representative to the UN.

13-08-2021||Editorials||When companies exercise control||To understand the controversy around Twitter’s decision to lock Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s account — he had posted a picture which revealed the identity of relatives of a minor rape victim, an offence under Indian law — it is important to go back to first principles. As this newspaper has consistently argued, Twitter is not an intermediary. It is a media company. Like other social media companies such as Facebook, by projecting itself as an intermediary, Twitter sought to distance itself from any content posted on the platform. But this was never a tenable position, for it sought to monopolise the benefits of being a media company while seeking to escape the legal obligations that came with it. In recent times, Twitter — using a range of tools — began exercising control over tweets. This made it even clearer that the platform was not just a platform; it was a media company which exercised judgment over what was legally allowed and what was not, what was manipulated and factually incorrect information and what was not, what constitutes hate speech and what does not. There were some who applauded Twitter’s editorial decisions and some who critiqued it, but the bottomline was this — the pretence of being an intermediary was over.Also Read | Rahul Gandhi slams Twitter, calls it biased platformThis is where the politics comes in. In India, both the government and its critics found the platform a useful tool to communicate messages. As Twitter began to flag legal and factual issues vis-a-vis the tweets of government ministers and ruling party spokespersons (for instance, Sambit Patra’s tweet on an alleged Congress “toolkit” was flagged as manipulated media), the Congress celebrated, egging on the social media company to persist with its approach. The situation is now the reverse. As Twitter cracked down on Mr Gandhi’s account (and thousands of other Congress accounts which reposted the same picture revealing the identity of family members of the victim), the government is smiling and Mr Gandhi is accusing a foreign company of interfering in Indian politics and democracy.And that is why, irrespective of what serves one’s interests at a particular point, India’s political class needs to evolve a broad framework consensually on social media companies. Hold them legally liable, just as mainstream media organisations are liable for their content, but preserve free speech. The government and the Opposition need to learn that complaining about each decision of a foreign company won’t help when they are willing to use the same company to score points against each other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/when-companies-exercise-control-101628852033479.html
