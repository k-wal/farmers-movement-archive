14-08-2021||Pune||Starting Sunday, all shops, malls, gyms, salons to remain open till 10pm in PMC, PCMC||PUNE: After the state government on Wednesday announced operational timings for various businesses till 10pm, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) on Saturday issued an order extending daily closing timings for businesses till 10pm, effective from Sunday.Following implementation of the latest round of relaxations in the cities of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad from Monday this week, only restaurants had been allowed to operate the dine-in facility till 10pm. With the Saturday order however, daily closing timings for other businesses too namely, all shops, malls, gymnasiums, salons, beauty parlours and spas have been extended from the earlier 8pm to 10pm within both civic limits.In the PMC order, Vikram Kumar, municipal commissioner Pune, said, “The orders issued by the state government on August 11, will be applicable in the limits of the PMC from August 15.” Kumar had earlier said that the decision regarding extension of business hours would be taken in the weekly covid-19 review meeting which hasn’t taken place yet.While operators of gyms, salons and beauty parlours welcomed the extension in timings, they also demanded relief from the government for the losses sustained during the lockdown.Nilesh Kale, president of the Pune Fitness Club Association, said, “The fitness industry is slowly dying and many popular chains have withdrawn from this business. With the extension in timings, we hope to get more clients but we still need some support from the government to sustain the losses.”Mall operators expressed the view that their business cannot revive unless the precondition of allowing only fully vaccinated people is relaxed. An official from a mall in the Shivajinagar area said, “Even if malls have reopened, the footfalls are less because of only fully vaccinated people being allowed entry. We have to turn down customers on a daily basis because they have only taken a single jab of the vaccine.” Earlier, traders in Pune expressed satisfaction over the 8pm deadline as well.Meanwhile, after a gap of almost five months, Pune’s popular market places were once again abuzz with customers on Saturday. Mahendra Pitaliya, secretary, Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP), said, “We got a good response on Saturday from customers. In the afternoon, there were long spells of rain which impacted the number of customers but by evening, the number began to increase again. We have been taking feedback from shop-owners from different parts of the city regarding the Saturday response for formulation of future policy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/starting-sunday-all-shops-malls-gyms-salons-to-remain-open-till-10pm-in-pmc-pcmc-101628965143820.html

The project is expected to take off by the end of this year. RLDA officials said they also had special plans for the development of this small piece of history (Gandhi-Nehru Park) that was a reminder of the freedom movement. “Under the project, the park would be developed in a special way so that its significance remains intact,” a senior RLDA official said. As per the blueprint of the project, the official said the park’s development would be carried out in two phases. The first phase would comprise landscaping and other infrastructure work while the second phase would include illumination and beautification. The historians gave the thumbs up to the project, which they said would preserve an important chapter of history. According to Roshan Taqui, a city-based historian, on December 26, 1916, a 27-year-old man arrived at Lucknow railway station from Allahabad and met another 47-year-old man for the first time in front of Charbagh station. The young man was Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru and the older one was Mohan Das Karam Chand Gandhi. “Why this place is significant is because it was here the two great personalities met for the first time during the freedom movement,” the historian said. RLDA officials said the entire project would be based on PPP model. “Three companies have shown interest. The papers are being scrutinised after which the work would be awarded,” the official said. Jagtosh Shukla, senior divisional commercial manager (DCM), NR said the project was expected to take off soon. “The entire modernisation project will be carried out in two phases. The first phase would be completed by 2025 whereas the second phase will take another two years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gandhinehru-park-atlucknow-s-charbagh-stn-poised-for-a-facelift-101628964844162.html

NGOs including Punjabi Bhasha Prasar Bhaichara, United Sikhs, Sangharsh, Naroa Punjab Manch, Initiators of Change and Vigilant Citizens Forum participated.Jaskirat Singh from Naroa Punjab Manch, industrialist Ranjodh Singh and Kuldeep Khaira from Vigilant Citizens Forum said the Mattewara industrial park will add to the pollution in the river and damage the Mattewara forest.Leading the group of protesters, Colonel (retired) CM Lakhanpal said, “The southern side of the high-tech cycle valley touches the nullah and an outlet of the sewage system is into the Buddha Darya. This can adversely impact the ongoing Buddha Darya rejuvenation project, if not handled carefully. Recent allocation of lands in the cycle valley to Birla and JK Group does not inspire confidence that Punjab is headed towards a cleaner future. The state needs eco-friendly industrial projects which do not cause air, water or soil pollution and industries like dyeing, textile, paper, cardboard and paint should be discouraged to save the existing natural resources.”Residents stated that Sutlej not only supplies drinking water to different parts of Punjab, but also to Rajasthan and is also used for agricultural and other purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-ngos-spearheading-agitation-to-save-sutlej-from-pollution-101628964726541.html

He said that despite high court’s order, Bains is roaming scot-free.He added that paddy was being procured from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar at ₹1,000 per quintal and being sold for ₹1,883 at mandis in Punjab and the money was being pocketed by corrupt officials and leaders. “A CBI probe was initiated, but it was conveniently pushed under the carpet. Once back in power, we will reopen the probe and take action against also those involved in large scale corruption,” said Majithia.He said it was utterly shameful that the Congress government had plundered Punjab and most corrupt ministers were given clean chit by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh.He also criticised Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo Arvind Kejriwal for taking the people of Punjab for a ride on the issue of subsidies.

They all escaped injury.Debris of the collapsing building also fell on the busy road outside and damaged power supply lines in the area. The rubble was being cleared after police’s arrival till the filing of this report.Neighbours complained that they had been complaining about the unsafe building and when the owner started work to dismantle it, he did not employ any safety precautions. A shopkeeper in the area, Kunal Sachdeva, said the MC should bring down the remaining portion of the building safely, as it could collapse further and cause injuries to the labourers working in it and passers-by.Despite several attempts, assistant town planner (ATP) Mohan Singh remained unavailable for comments. Station house officer (SHO), Division Number 3 police station, Madhu Bala said, “Barricading has been done outside the building as a precautionary measure.

14-08-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz | Loving the owl brat||When it comes to rescuing, rearing and releasing a little owl, the compassionate human may not get a ‘thank you’ note from the bird when it finally glides into the dark night. On the face of it, one of the most endearing chicks is that of the Indian scops owl (ISO). But its looks are deceptive as the unflaggingly patient and compassionate Sanjiv Khanna was to discover. He runs ‘Aashray’, a bird shelter in Jalandhar, and has rescued more than 1,300 birds since 1994. The ISO chick was discovered on the roadside by passersby and was blessed enough to somehow be delivered to the warm cup of Khanna’s palms. “For the first few days, the chick was totally dependent on us and overawed by human presence. When I would feed it chicken morsels, it would fold its sharp talons (claws) so that they did not prick into the palms of my hands. But later, after it gained confidence and once it had its daily feed, the chick grew a bit cocky. While sitting in the palm of my hand, it would frequently unfurl its talons and prick my flesh, sometimes even petulantly pecked at my fingers while I fed it,” Khanna told this writer.The adorable tramp would regale the Khannas with what they perceived as a dance: the chick would sway its body and couple it with varied movements of the head. The supposed ‘dance’ was actually the owl’s way of enhancing situational awareness or sharpening its three-dimensional view. An owl’s eyes are fixed in the socket but the head rotates fully and even dips sideways (180 degrees) to bring the world to its eye level. With Khanna’s house brimming with rescued birds, he has constructed a shelter for them on the first floor. But at night when diurnal birds go silent, captive owls can be a pain in the wrong place. “Owls are generally quiet during the day, but at night they create such a racket that sleep is impossible! So, they leave their perch on my arm or within my hands and I relocate them to the first floor during the night. Rescued barn owls hiss like enraged cobras at night and give humans trying to sleep the real jitters. The ISO is vociferous, it utters a medley of hisses, shrieks and cackles. However, rescued spotted owlets tend to keep the volume down at night,” revealed Khanna.Death begets new life On the graves of the dead, do the most beautiful flying flowers bloom.Nature has little time or emotive energies to spare and mourn the young dead. The remains of the jungle’s mortals, be it a fawn or an aging lion, offer the glimmer of new life to an opportunistic army of manual scavengers. What is still left after the scavengers are done with, assimilates into the soils and enriches the flourish of floral eruptions from the womb of mother earth. Each part of Death’s stillness is requisitioned to serve a movement and finds a designated slot in the endless reinvention and recycling of life forms, from animate to inanimate and vice versa.I stumbled upon this amoral truism of nature in the guise of a vividly contrasting spectacle: an ugly, rotting skeletal piece fancied by beautiful butterflies. I was on a ramble along the western hillsides flanking Perch Check Dam, situated a few miles behind the PGIMER. The pelvic girdle of a young sambar deer was degenerating speedily in the monsoon humidity. But common gull butterflies seemed to rejoice at death. The butterflies were indulging in a bout of mud-puddling, while being so prettily perched on rotting bones, flitting to and fro at the faintest shadow cast upon them as they nibbled away at the wholesome girdle.Mud-puddling is the generic term for a natural phenomenon. Male butterflies gather on substrates like wet soil, dung and rotting animal bodies to obtain nutrients such as mineral salts, sodium and ammonium ions, amino acids and simple carbohydrates, which may be absent in the nectar they otherwise feed on. Male butterflies pass on these collections to females as nuptial gifts through the spermatophore (a sac of nutrients combined with the sperm).

The Niti Aayog’s plan, First Play, lays down a strategy for India to win 50 medals in the 2024 Olympics. For a country that won seven medals at the Tokyo Olympics and has won 30 medals over the last 100 years, this goal seems to be a stretch. The Niti’s plan to get there makes the goal delusional. The well-meaning bureaucrats that run the Niti Aayog are programmed to find solutions through the government machinery. Thus, more government involvement is their solution to most problems. The First Play plan includes, among other things, ‘targeting’ 10 priority sports based on past success and something they call ‘high winning potential’. This sounds eerily like the License Raj policy that destroyed India’s economic growth for five decades. Allowing bureaucrats and politicians to pick priority sectors did not work for our economy and will not help Indian sports.Flaw in the plan Neeraj Chopra would never have succeeded under the Niti’s plan because javelin throw would not have featured in the list of priority sports as it did not have a success track record. Other athletes such as Swapna Barman, who won the Heptathlon Gold in the 2018 Asian Games; 400m runners like Milkha Singh and PT Usha, and the gymnast Dipa Karmakar would also not have made the cut. It is always the success of an elite athlete that increases participation in a sport. It was the success of Mark Spitz that gave an impetus to the next generation of American swimmers such as Michael Phelps and not some wacky government prioritisation scheme. Similarly, Usain Bolt ignited the recent success of Jamaican runners, not a government priority scheme. Let the talented athletes decide, which sports India wins medals in, not priorities set by bureaucrats or politicians. India can become a successful sporting country not through more government involvement, but by creating the right incentives for the athletes. These incentives are best created in a free market, unencumbered by government control. Professional sports management companies are in the business of finding talent, paying for their training, finding the best trainers, coaches and performance psychologists, and eventually making a profit for themselves and the athletes they represent by maximising their sponsorship value. Phelps, who has won as many medals (28) in the last four Olympics as India has in hundred years (30), has never received a penny from the US government. Sponsorship has paid for his training. Nurture young talent Countries such as Norway, Finland, and Germany have dozens of private sports clubs and schools dedicated to training world-class athletes. Sports management companies armed with the latest scientific methods in functional and muscle movement identify potential athletes from a very early age. They adopt, train, support, and convert these athletes into world-class medal winners. India needs a similar model, and, given the size of its market and its huge TV audience, professional sports companies would jump at the opportunity to be involved in Indian sports. America has dominated world athletics with over 2,600 Olympic medals. Yet its government has no involvement in sports. The US Olympic Committee is funded entirely from private sources and is privately managed. There are no bureaucrats or politicians in any sports federation, and unlike India, the US does not have a sports ministry.Abolish sports ministries India’s athletics, on the other hand, is still controlled by bureaucrats and politicians. They head the sports bodies, manage the budgets and decide what and who gets funded. This must stop. The government is not a help, but a hindrance for optimum athletic performance. All sports ministries must be abolished. Sports has to become an industry with its sports schools, sports clubs, private coaching academies, sports management companies, equipment manufacturers, professional leagues, TV rights, and sponsorships. The world of professional sports operates entirely in the private domain. Whether it is professional basketball, or soccer clubs like the Manchester United or Real Madrid, private ownership and management is the key. This should be the direction for sports in India. A good example is the IPL, a private cricket league, which has played a major role in raising the standard of Indian cricket.Market-based solutions that allow individuals to pursue goals based on their own set of skills and incentives are the best way to achieve optimum performance.Unshackle Indian athletes from the burden of dealing with the government and they will get 50 Olympic medals.sb@sanjivbhatia.com(The writer is the founder and CEO of Contract With India)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-unshackle-indian-athletes-for-more-olympic-success-101628962623956.html

14-08-2021||Chandigarh||Random forays | India needs a sports revolution||The signs have been evident for a while now. India’s sportspersons have sparkled intermittently on the global stage. But the culture of sports in our land just hasn’t kept pace. Our gargantuan system, with its elephantine gait, has just not been able to trot along rapidly enough to allow Indian sports to truly conquer the world stage.Happily, sport has briefly become one of the priorities of a large section of India’s populace, even if most people are bystanders and fair-weather friends of it! With the hoopla relating to our successes at Tokyo yet to die down, the time is ripe to strike the hot iron. Revolutionary changes in the firmament of sports are needed before more mundane matters overtake our collective consciousness yet again.Sport has the potential to empower women, create employment opportunities, enhance immunity levels, nurture balanced mindsets among the youth, and also calm society as a whole.Presented below are some ideas which can propel India to the forefront among sporting nations, instead of being an also-ran:1. Changing the game: The very ethos of our society needs to be shaken and stirred by inspirational interactions with medalists and champions. Each district of our country needs to prioritise sports for the young, in schools, colleges, community centres, panchayat ghars and on village common land. 2. Elevating National Sports Day: In this era of clanging and banging, we need to make more noise about sports. And what better day than Major Dhyan Chand’s birthday, which is our National Sports Day, but which hardly anyone knows about. Let us as a nation, celebrate it with every family participating in local sports tournaments, in every nook of India.3. More games periods in schools: Most children in India grow up having attended one games period per week, with one football available to a class of 50 kids. How can any of them become sports champions? In order to develop their interest in sports, there need to be more dedicated hours for all students in all schools, and maybe marks allocated for sporting excellence.4. Encouraging the girls: The reason for a large percentage of Indian medals coming through the feats of women participants is not tough to fathom. Girls are more sincere and disciplined in whatever they pursue, sports or studies. What they need is coaching, mentoring, encouragement, support and guidance. They also need those pernicious influences in society who intimidate them if they play a sport, to back off and to stay away!5. Neighbourhood schools to open their gates:One of the recommendations that our think tank, Suvichar, forwarded to the government, was the need for all schools, private and government, to open their fields and facilities to neighbourhood kids after school hours. Adequate supervision would indeed be needed, but children who live nearby should be allowed to play every evening at a nearby school on a regular basis.6. Pumping in CSR funds:The government is always limited in its resources and outreach, in its expertise and levels of excellence. Sports departments across the states of India need a fillip in the shape of conglomerates from industry coming forward with finances, infrastructure and even coaching staff, to create a true impact at the ground level, especially in rural India where athleticism is generally superior to urban parameters.7. Promoting team games: Sports like hockey, soccer and volleyball need to follow the cricket example, and develop a large catchment of players. The recent magnificence of the hockey teams, men and women, can be capitalised upon by organising age-group tournaments in all team sports at the state, district, block and village levels, with adequate prizes and incentives being offered to winners, and certificates to all participants.8. Inspiring the whole nation: By inviting Olympic medallists and all noted sports achievers to deliver lectures and hold regular interactions in schools, colleges and communities as well as with defence forces and para military staff, the whole nation can be inspired to adopt sports as a passion.The Olympic Games of Paris in 2024 are not far away, but let us start preparing for Los Angeles, 2028, and Brisbane, 2032, right away!vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-india-needs-a-sports-revolution-101628962323784.html
14-08-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout | Padma, I will meet you yet again…||None other than India’s nightingale Lata Mangeshkar in her tribute to Dogri poet Padma Sachdev, who passed from life to legend last week, said, “I am at a loss of words on hearing of the passing away of my dear friend, the famous Dogri poet and composer. Ours was a long and old friendship. She anchored my music concert in the US and I sang her Dogri song. It is a sad day for me.”Such was the charisma of the fair-faced girl, born in 1940 at Purmandal village of the Jammu hills, who went onto be hailed as the first modern poet of the Dogri language.I first caught a glimpse of Padma at an all-woman poetry symposium, which had been organised by Punjabi poet and television producer SS Misha in honour of Amrita Pritam winning the prestigious Jnanpith Award in 1981. My first introduction to her was her tinkling laughter and the jokes she was cracking as we sat in the bus that was to take us from the hotel to the auditorium.At the symposium, Padma was the lone Dogri star who charmed the audience with a recitation of her two famous poems – Deshnikala, in which she described exile as the lot of a young girl after marriage, and ‘Raaje Dian Mandian’, another classic poem on class difference.A home away from homeToo shy to ask her for an interview, I just wrote a piece on her poetry and the songs she had written for films. I was to meet her five years later on stage at yet another symposium, at the end of which she stopped me and said, laughing: “Hain te tu kallo par terian nazman barhi gorian ne. My aithe nerhe is Bengali Market rehandi haan, ghar aa ja kisse din!” (Though, you are dark, but your poems are fair enough. Why don’t you come and meet me at my house, which is close by in Bengali Market?)I was staying in Delhi those days and went to meet her. The warmth of Padma and her husband, Surinder Singh, the famous classical singer who made the duo with his elder brother Tejpal Singh, would make it my home away from home. The room of their daughter, Manjit Sachdev (Meeta), then but a child, was always at my disposal whenever I stayed the night. Meeta would bunk with one of her parents for the night and Padma would treat me to home-cooked food.Looking back at this rare couple who were the celebrities of the 80s, I wonder at their warmth and generosity in making a small-town Chandigarh girl part of their family in the cold and harsh capital city.The couple had just moved to Delhi from Mumbai as Meeta had developed allergies due to the damp weather. Their friends would keep dropping in from Mumbai and I got to meet the who’s who of writers and musicians in their Toder Mal Lane home. The most cherished part was the long time I got to spend with Ismat Chughtai of Lihaaf fame.Sitting on Meeta’s bed she would tell me one rare story after another of the Mumbai film world. Alzheimer’s disease had just about started setting in at the time, but Ismat was still alert and witty.Those were busy days for Padma. In the morning, she would go to her cabin in the library of the India International Centre to work on her book Sabad Milava, in which she was writing a prose piece accompanying her selected poems.She would leave Ismat Appa and I (the bad girls as she described us) stocked with cigarettes and beer in the fridge and return in the afternoon when it was time for Meeta to return from school. Oh! What days and what precious conversations.A friend for all timesDistance or long gaps of not being able to meet never weakened the tie of love and friendship with Padma and Surinderji as I moved back to Chandigarh. She was the happiest when I adopted a daughter. When I took her to meet Padma, what a celebration there was! Padma literally gave the child a silver spoon and Meeta’s best Russian doll.After a meningitis attack in 1988, many thought that Padma, who had braved and fought tuberculosis of the bones at age 16 at a Srinagar sanatorium, would succumb. However, there she was again winning more awards and accolades despite frail health.With my mother paralysed for long years and a daughter growing up, the meetings became fewer.The summer of 2019 was the last time I was to meet her. Surinderji was resting after a long stay in the hospital. Padma, too, was not well but had changed into a special suit to meet me. I saw something black on her upper lip and almost pulled it out when she stopped me because it was the oxygen line. It was then that I noticed the cylinder. “Don’t worry Padma, you will be fine!” I told her. “That I will be!” she replied confidently.Meeta who works for OTT platforms in Mumbai moved with them well before the Covid pandemic hit to be able to look after them. Meeta says her “ma” had been in the hospital for just two days when she insisted on returning home where she was actively planning what she would do in the future. “She called up just about everyone from Lata Mangeshkar to her dentist!”And then she went slowly into the good night. It is a line from Amrita’s poem to Imroz that comes to the mind: “Padma, I will meet you yet again…”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roundabout-padma-i-will-meet-you-yet-again-101628962026949.html
14-08-2021||Mumbai||Fully vaccinated citizens get on board Mumbai local trains||Local trains in Mumbai will resume operations for the fully vaccinated citizens today (Sunday) after a gap of four months. On April 15 this year, the local train services were closed for the general public for the second time amid the pandemic, owing to an increase in Covid-19 cases in the city.Apart from fully vaccinated passengers who have pre-verified their vaccination status and obtained a monthly travel pass, healthcare workers and essential service employees are allowed to use the trains as usual.Trains will operate between routine operational hours of the Central and Western Railways.Railway authorities said they are prepared to handle the extra crowd on trains starting Sunday, especially as the first day of opening up trains for part of the general public also coincides with Independence Day. Random ticket checks will be conducted at all railway stations to ensure only pass holders are using train services.The municipal corporations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), had since August 11, set up help desks at all railway stations for offline verification of vaccine status. Such desks were set up by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) at 53 railway stations on the central and western lines. Similarly, helpdesks were set up at 109 stations in the MMR.A spokesperson from Central railways said on Saturday, “In preparation for trains opening up for fully vaccinated beneficiaries, we have increased the number of ticket counters across stations. Before August 11, we had 300 counters, now we have 340, to avoid crowding at the ticket windows. Railway police have also been deployed, and ticket-checkers will conduct random checks at all stations. For Independence Day, Central Railway has taken additional security measures, a dog squad, and two ninja drone cameras for Mumbai division.”The Western Railways saw commuter traffic of an average of 150,000 passengers every day during the past four months when trains were not operating for the general public. A spokesperson from the Western Railways said, “On a weekend, we see around 120,000 passengers, and on a weekday it is around 150,000. This is likely to increase by a few thousand passengers as we have issued an average of 10,000 - 12,000 passes a day since August 11.”On Thursday, the state government also made the verification process online, via a web link, which generates an e-pass that can be showed at ticket counters to avail monthly travel passes.The process of applying online is as follows: Eligible citizens need to open the link: http://epassmsdma.mahait.org, click on the option travel pass for vaccinated citizens, mention their mobile number, which will generate a one time password via an SMS. After entering the OTP, other details such as the beneficiary name and reference number for vaccination status will automatically appear on the form. Citizens have to click on generate e-pass, upload a photograph that can be clicked using the phone camera. Within 48 hours, applicants will receive a link on their number, after which they can download the e-pass and save it in their mobile gallery.Applicants who have taken their second dose, but have not completed 14 days, will receive this link to download the e-pass only after 14 days are completed.So far, a total of 91,925 passes have been issued by the Central and Western Railways to fully vaccinated beneficiaries who have also completed 14 days after their second dose. On Wednesday, 34,353 suburban railway monthly passes were issued to passengers. Central Railway has issued 22,689 monthly passes, while the Western Railway issued 11,664 railway passes. On Thursday, 32,534 monthly passes were issued to the suburban railway passengers on both the Central and Western Railway networks. Of the 32,534 passes, 22,104 were issued on the Central Railway and 10,430 were issued on the Western Railway. On Friday, a total of 25,038 passes were issued, of which 17,765 monthly passes were issued by Central Railway and 7,873 passes were issued by Western Railway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fully-vaccinated-citizens-get-on-board-mumbai-local-trains-101628961123766.html

Modernity, along with a glimpse of patriotism is on offer. Beautification of Chirag Delhi to Sheikh Sarai is complete. Statues of freedom fighters and artifacts of historical heritage were placed along the road to celebrate 75 years of Independence. Delhi’s roads are being redesigned and made better, today a sample design of a road was inspected; 540 kms of roads are being beautified and redesigned along these lines,” said the CM in the statement.It further said, “Standards will be increased in the forthcoming projects to provide best quality roads -- 540kms of roads will be taken up in the first phase of the project. I appeal to the people of Delhi to give feedback on our work, inform us of our strengths and shortcomings.”The road redevelopment project was launched by the government in 2019. The public works department maintains 1,280 km roads in the city -- of which 540km roads in different parts of the city were chosen for the redesign and redevelopment project. All these roads chosen are more than 100-feet wide. Some common features of the project are creating grass carpet areas along pavements, cycling tracks, pedestrian tracks, installing adequate lighting, signages, constructing foot overbridges and placing benches along the roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kejriwal-reviews-road-revamp-projects-in-city-101628960764589.html
14-08-2021||Noida||No walk-in facility for second dose of Covid vaccine at CHC Bhangel||Though Saturday was reserved for second dose of Covid vaccine in Uttar Pradesh, the Community Health Centre (CHC) at Bhangel in Gautam Budh Nagar turned away hundreds of people looking for walk-in vaccination for second dose due to a limited supply of vaccines.CHC Bhangel caters to a large population of Noida villages and urban sectors, including sectors 104, 110, 108, 137, 82, 93, 47 and 44.“The centre is near my residence. When I could not find a slot for second dose online, I reached the centre at 11am for walk-in vaccination. However, there was already a huge crowd at the centre for walk-in vaccination and people were being turned away as only those who had booked slots online were getting the second dose,” said Devesh Chaturvedi, a resident of Lotus Panache in Sector 104.Officials said that as the centre opened at 10am, at least 500 people came for walk-in vaccinations.“Till 1pm, we turned away at least 500 people as we did not have walk-in slots for the second dose. The health department had provided us with 350 doses of vaccines, including 150 for second dose. The doses were for beneficiaries who booked slots online,” said Dr Yatendra Singh, medical superintendent at CHC Bhangel.Dr Neeraj Tyagi, GB Nagar district immunisation officer, said that CHC Bhangel was the only government Covid vaccination centre (CVC) in the district that was not given walk-in slots for second dose.“With a limited number of vaccines, we try to divide the stock among all CVCs as per the demand and population they cater to. CHC Bhangel is the only one where walk-in slots were not opened on Saturday for second dose. Often 100% of beneficiaries who book their slots online do not turn up. So, by 1pm, we get an idea of how many vaccines are left, and after that we open the walk-in slots,” said Dr Tyagi.Later in the day, 50 slots were opened for walk-in vaccination of second dose at CHC Bhangel, said Dr Singh.Dr Sunil Kumar Sharma, GB Nagar chief medical officer, said, “The walk-in slots for second dose were later opened after it was reported to the department that a number of walk-in beneficiaries were coming to the centre for second dose.”GB Nagar administered a total of 7,521 jabs on Saturday, of which 786 were first doses and 6,735 second doses, the officials said, adding that the vaccinations were carried out at 23 government CVCs.Child PGI hospital in Sector 30 renamed The Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute (SSPHPGTI) in Noida’s Sector 30, commonly known as Child PGI, has been renamed as the Post Graduate Institute of Child Health, Noida.“We had submitted an application to the Uttar Pradesh administration to rename the institute as the name was very long. The application has been approved and the changes are effective from today,” said Dr Akash Raj, medical superintendent at the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/no-walk-in-facility-for-second-dose-of-covid-vaccine-at-chc-bhangel-101628960765295.html

She was chairing a meeting to review the status of compliance reduction across departments. All heads of department have been directed to reduce compliances expected to industry, even more, by the end of the month. Mahajan said the compliances fell under two categories, government to business (G2B) and government to citizen (G2C) – were being reduced to save the cost and time of users. She asked all administrative secretaries to identify more such compliances, where simplification is required, considering the fact that it will ultimately benefit the society at large. She added that Invest Punjab is the nodal agency for coordinating with all departments concerned for timely implementation of G2B compliances; Governance Reforms and Grievances department is the nodal agency for G2C compliances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-chief-secy-reviews-progress-on-ease-of-doing-business-in-state-101628960763956.html
14-08-2021||Noida||Jab shortage hits move to increase second dose coverage in Ghaziabad||More than 7,000 Covid-19 vaccines, including 2,203 first doses, were administered till 6pm on Saturday, that was the first ‘second dose day’ observed in the district. The Uttar Pradesh government had directed that starting August 14, every Saturday will be reserved for beneficiaries scheduled to take their second doses while weekdays will remain open for both first and second-dose recipients. The district administered 7,313 doses on Saturday with 69.87% of the shots administered to beneficiaries scheduled to take their second doses.“On Saturday, we reserved about 80% doses for second dose recipients and the remaining for first dose beneficiaries. But many people, including senior citizens, arrived during the day. So, instead of turning them away, we administered the jabs. We have some stock left from the vaccination drive of Friday and will receive more stocks on Sunday for the inoculation drive to be held on Monday,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for vaccination.The district opened 31 centres for the inoculation drive on Saturday. Many first-time beneficiaries also went to take the jab, due to which serpentine queues were observed at many centres. “Since the stock of vaccine was low, we had to curtail operation of several centres,” said Mathuria, adding that six centres in rural areas offered both doses on public demand.  “I came to take the second shot, along with my mother, and it took us about an hour to get the jab. In between, I went to another centre in Kavi Nagar industrial area, but there were long queues there too. I came back to the first centre and waited to take the jab,” said Prateek Pal, who arrived at the vaccination centre at the Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital.Till Saturday, the district administered total 1,684,129 doses, which include 1,366,905 first doses and 317,224 second doses. Likewise, Uttar Pradesh has so far administered 57,412,747 doses, which include 48,238,092 (84.02%) first doses and 9,174,655 (15.98%) second doses. Health experts said taking the second dose is very important for protection against Covid-19. “The strategy of ‘second dose day’ is a good initiative but it needs adequate vaccine stock to make the drive a success. If first dose beneficiaries also arrive on the same day, it will defeat the purpose. Officials must plan accordingly, so that the second dose day is observed in true spirit,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/jab-shortage-hits-move-to-increase-second-dose-coverage-in-ghaziabad-101628960582994.html
14-08-2021||Noida||Two persons arrested for murder of 30-year-old man in Dadri||Two suspects were arrested from Dadri on Saturday for allegedly killing a 30-year-old man three days ago. The suspects were identified as Anuj Singh, 26, and Gajendra Lohar, 25, residents of Chakrasenpur in Dadri. On August 11, Amit Bhati was allegedly shot dead by eight men over personal enmity in Chakrasenpur village. According to police, Bhati was driving his car when the criminals, some in a Mahindra Scorpio and others on two motorcycles, overtook the victim’s vehicle and sprayed bullets at him. Bhati was admitted to a private hospital where he died. Bhati’s cousin Manish filed a complaint at Dadri police station and named eight suspects – Anuj Singh, Gajendra Lohar, Satish, Manoj, Naresh, Manish, Suresh, and Sittu. A case was registered against them under sections 147 (rioting), 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of IPC. Police said they received information about the two suspects’ movement on a motorcycle in Dadri’s Derin Cot village on Saturday. “A police team reached the spot and arrested the two persons. Police recovered a countrymade gun and a pistol from their possession,” said Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida.Pradeep Tripathi, SHO, Dadri police station, said that the two parties had an old enmity. “There was no specific reason for the enmity. The two arrested suspects said that they had fled their village a few months ago fearing attack by Bhati,” he said, adding that police have launched a search for the other suspects. Tripathi said the two suspects were produced in court that sent them to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-persons-arrested-for-murder-of-30-year-old-man-in-dadri-101628960163050.html
14-08-2021||Noida||Ramsar tag eludes Dhanauri wetland again, activists call for serious steps||On Saturday, when the Union environment ministry announced the names of four wetlands that were recognised as Ramsar sites — wetland of international importance — the absence of Gautam Budh Nagar’s Dhanauri was noticed.Spread across 101 hectares, Dhanauri wetland serves as a sanctuary for the vulnerable (as listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature) state bird of Uttar Pradesh, the Sarus crane. Not only did Dhanauri missed out on the Ramsar tag, but it is also yet to be conferred the status of “sanctuary” for the crane that would give it additional protection.While officials from the district’s forest department said that they are working on getting the Ramsar tag, experts said that the “government is only protecting the already protected”.Noida-based birder Anand Arya, who discovered the Dhanauri wetland and had been pushing for its conservation pointed out that all four sites declared Ramsar on Saturday were “either wildlife sanctuary or bird Sanctuaries”.“It seems that the government is not making efforts to save unrecognised or non-notified wetlands and only adding its tally of Ramsar sites by declaring the already protected sites like national parks or bird sanctuaries. Thol and Wadhwana (both in Gujarat) are bird sanctuaries, Sultanpur is a national park and Bhindawas is a wildlife sanctuary (both in Haryana) ,” said Anand Arya.Ramsar sites are the wetlands of international importance. India is a signatory to the Ramsar Convention held in 1971 in Iran that seeks to recognise and protect the important wetlands of the world. India has a total of 45 Ramsar sites and the surface area covered by these sites is now 1,083,322 hectares.“The forest department has been sitting on it (proposal to forward Dhanauri as a Ramsar site) for over seven years. So far, they did not even submit the detailed study to the Ramsar secretariat to make a case for it,” said Anand Arya.In 2018, the district forest department first sent its proposal to declare the waterbody as a wetland under Wetland Rules 2017, the state government has initiated the process and appointed a nodal officer for the task.In September 2020, the officials from Wetland International and state forest department began ground inspection and terrain analysis to make a case for the wetland to be declared as a Ramsar site and a Sarus crane sanctuary. Later that year, the forest department roped in WWF, officials said.“We had been working with different organisations like WWF also to gather a lot of information regarding Dhanauri This is a tedious task. We are however now in much better position and within next one month the forest department will send its proposal and detailed reports to the Ramsar secretariat to name Dhanauri a Ramsar site” said Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest officer, GB Nagar.Once home to over 211 species of birds the Dhanauri wetland has suffered a habitat loss and drop in bird populations over the years. In April this year, the forest department has to rushed to fill the wetland using borewells after it ran dry for the first time following high temperatures and unregulated farming in the area.In January, the Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) 2021, held by Wetlands International South Asia and the district forest department, found over four times drop in bird population as compared to 2020. The AWC 2021 found only 1,344 birds against 6,227 birds in January last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ramsar-tag-eludes-dhanauri-wetland-again-activists-call-for-serious-steps-101628959862754.html
14-08-2021||Bangalore||Districts to decide on Covid-19 restrictions, testing, vaccination to be increased: Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai||Following a meeting with experts on Covid-19 in the state, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Saturday said that the state government has decided to delegate power to the district authorities to manage the situation after ruling out a statewide plan.The decision was taken based on the opinion of the Technical Advisory Committee on Covid-19 was of the opinion that the second wave of infections were not over in the state.“We cannot formulate a statewide COVID-19 management plan. It should be district specific,” news agency PTI quoted the CM as saying after the meeting. Alongside experts, ministers and other state officials also attended the meeting. He also said that the decision on implementing lockdown will be made based on the positivity rate of a particular district. Further, in districts where the positivity rate is above 2%, schools would not be reopened, the CM said.Also read | Covid-19: Karnataka bans processions on Muharram, Ganesh ChaturthiThe experts had expressed their concerns that the positivity rate in the state was not reducing and the daily infections in the state was hovering around the 1600- to 1800-mark, Bommai said. During the end of the first wave, the single-day infections came down to 300 cases, he added. “We have to prevent Covid-19 because this disease is still around. Since the cases are still remaining between 1,600 and 1,800, we need to be careful,” he added.Testing and vaccination for the disease have been planned to be ramped up in some districts namely, Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Mysuru, Hassan, Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru, Shivamogga and Bengaluru Rural, the CM said. They should also be increased in villages that are up to 10kms inside Karnataka from the borders with Kerala and Maharashtra. Further, it was also decided in the meeting to increase testing in Bengaluru, Raichur, Kalaburagi, Ballari, Bidar, Koppal, Haveri, Vijayapura, Tumakuru and Chikkamagaluru.Among other measures, six new genome sequencing labs would also be set up in Bengaluru, Raichur, Kalaburagi, Ballari, Bidar, Koppal, Haveri, Vijayapura, Tumakuru and Chikkamagaluru over the next three weeks to keep a track of new variants of the disease.As far as vaccinations are concerned, 40 million people have been inoculated in the state as of date, the CM said. While the state has a stock of 1.5 million vaccine doses, it will also receive 3 million doses by the end of August, he added. “We are demanding more vaccines. Next week I am going to meet the union health minister. We are getting 65 lakh vials every month, which should be increased to one crore. If that arrives, we can vaccinate all the districts,” he said.Bommai further mentioned that a case has been filed in the Kerala High Court against Karnataka’s move to mandate a negative RT-PCR certificate for people arriving from Kerala. “It's a different matter that we will fight it out legally but I would like to say that the first wave started from Kerala and maximum cases related to second wave is in Kerala. Hence, Kerala has to control Covid cases,” he added.Schools in the state would be reopened from September 23 and not August 23 the CM said, mentioning that the classes would resume in two alternative batches. He also said that the standard operating procedure regarding the number of students permitted and the precautions to be taken was also prepared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/districts-to-decide-on-covid-19-restrictions-testing-vaccination-to-be-increased-karnataka-cm-basavaraj-bommai-101628959258084.html

AAP MLA from Delhi, national spokesperson and Punjab affairs co-incharge, Raghav Chadha, said, “I have come to seek guidance from the light of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the dream of a great India.” Chadha questioned the political, economic and social situation of Punjab and the country and said what successive governments have done to fulfil the dreams of these martyrs. “Today, the youth of Punjab is unemployed and ensnared to drugs, thanks to the ruling elite. The landlords of Punjab, the farmers of Punjab, the labourers of Punjab are forced to commit suicide. It has become difficult for the poor to live,” he said. Chadha said the youth of the state were sitting on dharnas for jobs and the teachers who were to shape the future of Punjab were sitting on the streets for their rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/show-what-you-have-done-for-martyrs-aap-to-state-centre-101628959744251.html
14-08-2021||Mumbai||SC upholds NGT order, instructs BMC to take steps to stop polluting water bodies||The Supreme Court on Friday declined to stay an order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), dated October 2020, which rapped the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for discharge of raw sewage into city creeks, rivers and drains. The SC said prescribed pollution norms are being violated, and directed BMC to expedite compliance with NGT’s orders which includes paying environmental compensation to the tune of ₹34 crore, in addition to future penalties.BMC had filed a civil appeal before the Supreme Court in March, seeking a stay on NGT’s directions issued in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) by NGO Vanashakti. The civic body had also attempted to stay a subsequent execution application that Vanashakti filed before NGT in June after observing little action by BMC toward complying with the Tribunal’s orders. A May audit report by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) revealed that none of the Tribunal’s mandated actions have been complied with so far.The SC on Friday allowed Vanashakti’s execution application to proceed and also clarified that the municipal commissioner himself will be responsible for compliance with NGT’s directions. However, the Apex court granted some relief in that the commissioner need not appear before the Tribunal in person. NGT had last month directed BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal to be present in person for the next hearing on August 28, while imposing additional environmental compensation of ₹2.1 crore on BMC.“The municipal corporation must, in our view, make every effort to comply with the directions of the NGT by setting up the required facilities and upgrading existing facilities. Humanity can ill afford the luxury of using water bodies as dumping grounds of municipal waste. It is absolutely no valid answer to say that the directions which have been issued by NGT would pose budgetary implications for the municipal corporation...,” noted the Supreme Court bench comprising justice DY Chandrachud and justice MR Shah.The Apex court also directed that within a period of two weeks, the commissioner shall file an affidavit before NGT “categorically indicating the steps which have been taken to comply with the directions of NGT, particularly with regard to ensuring compliance with the requisite standards for the discharge of effluents including municipal waste and sewage.”BMC, in a written response to MPCB earlier this year, had stated it would require at least another “four to five years” to stop polluting Mumbai’s creeks, stormwater drains and rivers with raw or partially-treated sewage. Officials with BMC’s sewage disposal project declined to comment on the story, saying that an official response will be presented to NGT in compliance with Supreme Court directions. At present, only one of the eight operational sewage treatment plants (STP) — the 37 million litres per day (MLD) one in Colaba — in the city is compliant with the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) latest discharge standards. The remaining STPs in Worli, Bandra, Ghatkopar, Bhandup, Versova, Charkop and Malad, some of which were constructed more than 20 years ago, are currently not fully equipped with the required sequencing batch bioreactor (SBBR) technology and continue to discharge polluting effluents into creeks, laboratory analyses by MPCB showed.However, fully-functional STPs are not the only solution to the problem. To prevent dry weather flow of untreated sewage in city’s creeks and rivers and to prevent the flow of waste into rivers, Mumbai also needs a well-connected system of sewer lines. The existing 2,025-km-long network services only 84% of Mumbai’s developed area and 68% of the city’s population, as per BMC. Due to these shortcomings, there are still 93 openings across the city and suburbs which continue to discharge untreated sewage directly into creeks and drains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sc-upholds-ngt-order-instructs-bmc-to-take-steps-to-stop-polluting-water-bodies-101628959628359.html

Of these, about 11,551 registered their mobile number to access the digital voter ID card. On Saturday, under the testing phase of e-EPIC for an hour between 11am -12 noon, only 170 voters downloaded their digital cards. Across the country, almost 29 lakh (2.9 million) voters had to test the application,” said Rajendra Huda, district election officer.The e-EPIC was launched on January 25 this year as an alternative and faster mode of obtaining the voter ID in a digital format. Only new electors registered during the special summary revision of 2021 are eligible to get digital IDs. All new registrations with mobile numbers get SMS for downloading e-EPIC. They can download the same based on one-time pin (OTP) authentication.According to a statement issued by the district administration on Saturday, the Election Commission of India (ECI) conducted the load testing of the e-EPIC server by allowing 2.9 million newly registered voters to download the application.Currently, in Gurugram there are about 1,252,000 voters, but the service is not applicable for everyone.According to Huda, the service will expand to include all general voters in the next couple of months. “The election commission is yet to open the service for all voters across the country. Since the load on the server will increase, it is being opened in a stepwise manner to avoid any hassle. Currently, only those who were registered from January 25 to 31 are included,” said Huda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/170-newly-registered-voters-download-digital-ids-101628959627125.html

On Sunday afternoon, a trial service with one bus from Gurugram till Ballabgarh in Faridabad will be started. Officials said that this is being tried as an alternative to CNG buses to control pollution in these two cities, which is a major concern for most parts of the year. At present, a charging station for the bus has been set up at the Sector 8 office of the transport department in Faridabad. Rajeev Nagpal, the general manager of Haryana Roadways Engineering Corporation (HREC), said, “With the aim of controlling pollution in these two cities, state transport minister Mool Chand Sharma will be inaugurating this bus service after 3pm on Sunday. At present, we will monitor this service for two months to see its performance. The bus has a capacity of covering 150-200kms on a single charge.” The price of each ticket in the 33-seater electric bus has been set at ₹75. Nagpal said that after monitoring the service for two months and understanding the cost of operation on road, the department has the capacity to expand the fleet to 250 for use all across Delhi-NCR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/first-electric-bus-between-gurugram-faridabad-to-start-pollution-control-the-aim-101628959625490.html
14-08-2021||Gurugram||Rajiv Chowk needs signals and pedestrian refuge islands, say experts||Experts recommended installation of traffic signals, pedestrian refuge islands and pelican lights, among other safety measures, at Rajiv Chowk to make commute safer for pedestrians and cyclists, as per a report prepared on the behest of the district administration.The report, prepared by WRI India, Raahgiri Foundation, and Nagarro, to reduce the number of accidents and fatalities at the Rajiv Chowk black spot was submitted to deputy commissioner Yash Garg earlier in the week.A 500-metre stretch of a national highway is considered a black spot when more than five fatal accidents or at least 10 fatalities have been recorded over a three-year period.As per the report, from 2017-2020, there have been 23 fatalities at the intersection, of which 11 were pedestrians and five were cyclists. Further, 22 people suffered grievous injuries and 11 people suffered minor injuries due to lack of pedestrian amenities.Rajiv Chowk is one of the most congested areas in the city, with traffic from Sohna Road, service lanes of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and Old Railway Road converging at the intersection.The issue of the high number of accidents, fatalities and lack of proper pedestrian amenities had been brought up in district road safety meetings, including the most recent one on July 16, in which Garg asked for a comprehensive study of Rajiv Chowk.“A study of Rajiv Chowk by the three companies has been received earlier this week and is in the process of being reviewed. All findings and recommendations will be individually analysed and depending on their feasibility, directions will be issued to relevant public bodies to implement necessary changes on the ground,” said Garg.According to the report, signal-free movement at the intersection leaves pedestrians and cyclists vulnerable to accidents while crossing the road. It also highlighted that a non-motorised-transport (NMT) underpass is in a dilapidated state and is poorly lit, maintained, unclean and unsafe, due to which it is rarely used by cyclists and pedestrians.The report stated both the NMT underpass as well as a pedestrian bridge at the intersection are “impractical” to use as they increase the distance by three times. To overcome this, experts have recommended setting up dedicated at-grade pedestrian crossings, such as refuge islands, at the intersection along with pelican lights so that pedestrians and cyclists can navigate the intersection safely in the shortest distance.Further, experts also called for the installation of signals to check the speed of vehicles and ensure pedestrians have adequate time to cross the road.A pedestrian refuge island is an elevated median, which is wide in length and allows adequate space for pedestrians and cyclists to safely wait on the structure and proceed ahead when the traffic or pelican signal changes. A pelican light, used solely for pedestrians and cyclists, operates similar to a conventional traffic signal.“There is already a flyover and underpass at the intersection, allowing high-speed traffic movement between Manesar and Delhi. Hence, the intersection being non-signalised is redundant. The introduction of refuge islands and pelican lights along with traffic signals has been recommended so that pedestrians and cyclists have safe passage, something the NMT underpass and pedestrian bridge have been unable to provide due to the incorrect placement and poor maintenance,” Sarika Panda Bhatt, a co-founder of Raahgiri foundation and a road safety expert with Nagarro, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rajiv-chowk-needs-signals-and-pedestrian-refuge-islands-say-experts-101628959623560.html
14-08-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: 2 held for running fake Aadhaar card racket||Two people were arrested on Saturday for allegedly running a racket of making fake Aadhaar cards and other documents in Greater Noida West for the past six months, said police. Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said police received information about the movement of the two suspects near Chaar Murti roundabout on Saturday. “A police team reached the spot and apprehended the two. The suspects have been identified as Shadab Alam (30), a resident of Sector Omicron 1 in Greater Noida, and his accomplice Sahil (25), a resident of Dankaur,” he said. During interrogation, police said, the suspects revealed that they produced fake Aadhaar cards, driving licences, and mark-sheets of class 10 and 12 and sold them to make quick money. The police team then conducted a search at their cyber cafe in Etcher area and recovered four computers, four CPUs, three printers, one spiral binding machine, two lamination machines, three keyboards, 54 Aadhaar cards, 50 blank Aadhaar cards, 39 blank registration certificates of vehicles, 51 driving licences, three photo copy machines, 12 mark-sheets of intermediate, 14 mark-sheets of Class 10, one birth certificate, among other documents. A case has been registered against them under Section 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the IPC. The suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody. Meanwhile, the suspects’ kin and their advocates Arti Gupta and Aman Asht reached the police station after getting information about their arrest and claimed that the allegations levelled against them are false. “My client Shadab was working at his cafe and making corrections in an Aadhaar card, and not making a fake one, when police picked him up and sealed the cafe. The other documents shown in the press conference were planted,” Gupta said. She also alleged that police detained a 16-year-old boy in connection with this case. Anita Chauhan, station house officer at Bisrakh police station, said the minor has been released after questioning. “The suspect’s family hired an advocate after he was arrested. The advocate was trying to defend her client. We have seized fake documents from Shadab’s cafe,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-2-held-for-running-fake-aadhaar-card-racket-101628959624169.html
14-08-2021||Gurugram||Sultanpur National Park gets Ramsar tag, of international importance||The Sultanpur National Park was notified as a Ramsar site, a wetland of international importance, by the union environment ministry on Saturday, a move that is expected to boost wildlife protection and tourism in the region, said officials. The Bhindawas Wildlife Sanctuary was also notified as a Ramsar site, making these two the first such sites of international importance in Haryana.The ministry of environment forest and climate change, in a tweet on Saturday, stated, “Four more sites in India get declared as Ramsar sites. These are Thol and Wadhwana from Gujarat and Sultanpur and Bhindawas from Haryana. With this, the number of Ramsar sites in India is 46 and the surface area covered by these sites is now 1,083,322 hectares.”The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands is an intergovernmental treaty adopted on February 2, 1971, in the Iranian city of Ramsar, on the southern shore of the Caspian Sea. It came into force in India on February 1, 1982, under which wetlands of international importance are declared as Ramsar sites.The Sultanpur National Park supports more than 220 species of resident, winter migratory and local migratory waterbirds at critical stages of their life cycles. The site supports more than 10 globally threatened species, including the endangered Egyptian vulture, steppe Eagle, Pallas’s fish eagle, and black-bellied tern, which are also found at the Bhindawas sanctuary.The Bhindawas sanctuary, the largest wetland in Haryana, is a man-made freshwater wetland. Over 250 bird species use this sanctuary throughout the year as resting and roosting sites.Officials said that by being declared a Ramsar site, restrictions on construction activities and non-forest activities come into effect around the wetland for increased protection. The Gurugram wildlife department is awaiting formal notification from higher authorities.“Being declared as a Ramsar site will help us protect and preserve these wetlands in a better manner. Restrictions on construction activities around the wetland, non-forest activities, which are already imposed, get further push as now the area is of international importance too. At present, habitat management is the focus of the department to further improve the ecology of the area,” an official of the district wildlife department said.Officials also said that the Ramsar tag helps increase tourism as international tourists like to visit such sites.Experts, however, said that a Ramsar tag does not help much in protection and called for the declaration of more sites as wetlands in the state.Pankaj Gupta, of the Delhi Bird Foundation, said, “It would be better if other places which are equally good in Gurugram and Jhajjar districts get declared as wetlands. Then, we would be able to protect more such habitats. A Ramsar tag for a national park or a sanctuary does not add much as they already have the protection of the highest order. It only brings these places on the international map.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/sultanpur-national-park-gets-ramsar-tag-of-international-importance-101628959565104.html
14-08-2021||Noida||GB Nagar police commissioner gets President’s medal||Noida: Gautam Budh Nagar police commissioner Alok Singh will receive the President’s Police Medal for Distinguished Service on Independence Day. The 1995-batch IPS officer took charge as commissioner in January 2020 and is credited to have efficiently managed crime and the pandemic in the district. “I am really thankful to the government of India for considering and bestowing this award on me. The award is more for my team that relentlessly worked in establishing this new commissionerate. They have done an outstanding and fantastic job. I dedicate this medal to them,” said the 54-year-old officer. “With the setting up of the commissionerate system, police are more responsible and accountable. Organised crime were taken head-on. With the use of magisterial power in the commissionerate system, active gangs have been legally restrained.” The commissioner said he aims to take policing to a higher level both in quality of response as well as building trust among citizens. “We are planning to set up 10 more police stations in the district,” he said. When the pandemic struck, Singh engaged the police to help the needy during the nationwide lockdown and organised special camps for the vaccination of personnel against Covid-19.Singh, a native of Aligarh, had earlier served as inspector general of police in Kanpur and Meerut range. On January 26, 2021, he was also honoured with the Union home minister’s Utkrisht Seva Padak. Singh previously commanded 10 other Uttar Pradesh districts -- Kaushambi, Baghpat, Basti, Sonbhadra, Raebareli, Sitapur, Unnao, Bijnor, Kanpur and Meerut. He is also credited with efficiently handling the situation in Ayodhya as the Supreme Court pronounced its verdict on the Babri Masjid-Ram janmabhoomi case in November 2019 when he was posted as the Meerut inspector-general. Meanwhile, 10 police officials from Gautam Budh Nagar will be honoured by the state government for meritorious service. Additional commissioner Love Kumar will get a platinum medal; Assistant police commissioner P P Singh gold medal; deputy commissioner of police (women safety) Vrinda Shukla silver medal; inspector Anita Chauhan silver medal; and sub-inspector Anil Kumar silver medal. Five others – sub-inspector Devendra Singh, constable Mahipal Singh, head constable Ranveer Singh, sub-inspector Shahvez Khan and inspector Vivek Trivedi - will get the state’s Utkrisht Seva Padak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gb-nagar-police-commissioner-gets-president-s-medal-101628959563918.html

Bajwa added the Congress has always been the vanguard of social and economic change and ensuring a fairer, more just life for all. Tamil Nadu has already announced a separate agriculture budget for itself.“The Punjab government is in a unique position in bringing about the second green revolution in the state and we must not let this opportunity pass,” he said, adding, “A separate agricultural budget will allow greater stakeholder consultation between farmers, agriculturalists and allied industries with the government. We will have a more targeted, focused approach to agricultural policy in the state.”Bajwa added that the budget of Tamil Nadu has looked into promoting organic farming, building local weekly markets for agricultural produce and promoting vegetable/herbal/fruit production. Bajwa said agriculture has historically been the culture of Punjab and state’s successes during the Green Revolution has ensured that it became the food bowl of India. “Nevertheless, today Punjab stands at the threshold of a second green revolution. There is an urgent need to diversify from the paddy/wheat cycle to ensure the survival of future generations of farmers. Without urgent action, Punjab’s agriculture will be irrevocably damaged,” Bajwa added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-must-have-a-separate-agriculture-budget-bajwa-in-letter-to-captain-101628959563475.html
14-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Vaccinate fast, think of booster doses, say experts||Of the 66 Delta Plus cases identified in Maharashtra, only 10 people were fully vaccinated, while eight had received only one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. State health officials said that two of these patients had received Covaxin while the rest had got Covishield. Amidst the fear of mutant strains and abysmally low vaccination coverage, the medical fraternity is not just emphasising primary jabs but also booster doses to curtail the spread of the infection. “We will need booster doses for the population, but unfortunately we are stuck with an extremely slow rollout of the primary vaccination,” said Vellore-based virologist DT Jacob John. Experts say that the first, second or third dose for Covid-19 is likely to act as a priming dose. The population will require booster doses on top of the priming doses for long-lasting immunity. Some experts say that the vulnerable population like senior citizens and those with comorbid conditions should be considered for booster doses. “It is now widely known that the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) can cause breakthrough infections. We don’t know what the Delta Plus is capable of as yet,” said John. Breakthrough infections are those that occur among people two weeks after completing the mandated full vaccination schedule. The Delta variant, which was labelled as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization (WHO), is known as highly transmissible. Nearly 80% of the samples sent for genome sequencing from Maharashtra have the Delta variant, suggesting that it is widespread in the state. The Delta Plus or AY.1 is a mutation of the Delta variant, but little is known about its behaviour. “The clinical manifestations of Delta Plus patients have not shown anything unusual,” said infectious disease expert Dr Vasant Nagvekar who is also a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force. “To break the chain of infection, vaccination is the key. Our vaccination drives should be carried out at a greater speed,” he said. The unvaccinated population and those who are unexposed to the virus through a natural infection carry the highest risk of getting infected. Experts say that this large group also provides a conducive ground for the virus to mutate. For instance, Maharashtra has recorded five Delta Plus-related deaths, all among senior citizens and those with multiple comorbidities. Of these, only two were fully vaccinated. Of the 66 cases that have been identified in the state, 33 patients are in the age group of 19 to 45 years, 18 patients are in the age group of 46 to 60 and eight patients were above 60 years. Seven patients are in the paediatric age group were below 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-vaccinate-fast-think-of-booster-doses-say-experts-101628959505274.html

As the train was superfast, it would have stopped at Vasai directly after Borivli,” said Pawar. The accused entered the ladies compartment at Borivli station as the train began to start. He then assaulted Jaiswal and hit her on chest, stomach, head and ears. He then snatched her phone and jumped off the running train while it was still at Borivli station.Jaiswal alighted the train at Vasai and reported the incident to the police. The case was transferred to Borivli GRP, following which they scanned CCTV of the platform and identified the accused.“Once we had the description of the accused, we alerted our informers. Within 24 hours, we received information that the accused was likely to visit Vasai station,” added Pawar.Police laid a trap at Vasai railway station and arrested the accused near the rickshaw stand on Friday. The accused has been identified as Akash Dhode, a pavement dweller from Jogeshwari.GRP officers said that they have recovered Jaiswal’s mobile phone from Dhode and are now investigating to find out if Dhode has committed any other robbery.Pawar said unmanned entry and exit points, especially vacant stretches near railway tracks, are the places from where such robbers enter station premises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/man-assaults-woman-in-mumbai-local-snatches-her-mobile-arrested-101628959503433.html

14-08-2021||Mumbai||May stop NHAI work if Sena leaders continue obstruction: Gadkari to CM Thackeray||Union minister for transport and highways Nitin Gadkari has written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray over the obstruction created by local Shiv Sena leaders and workers in the road construction works undertaken by National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) in Washim, which has led to a flutter in the state. The Union minister warned Thackeray government that it would consider stopping the road construction if the situation continues. Following this, Maharashtra home department has asked the director general of police (DGP) to inquire into the matter and submit a report immediately.Gadkari, in his letter dated July 23, cited three examples of obstruction by local Sena leaders who allegedly threatened contractors and vandalised equipment, spreading panic among workers. He has specifically mentioned that the work of the three highways has been obstructed in Washim Lok Sabha constituency by Sena workers. The letter also stated that NHAI is re-considering whether the road construction work should be discontinued amid these disruptions.Taking a serious note of it, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government led by Uddhav Thackeray has sought a report from the DGP. Home department has written a letter to the DGP on August 12, asking him to take action in such cases and submit a report immediately.“NHAI has undertaken road construction projects in a big way in the state. Elected representatives and their followers allegedly have been asking for illegal favours from officers and contractors. The ongoing works may get stopped if action is not taken against such individuals, as mentioned in the letter by Union minister. You are informed to find out whether the contractors have registered any such complaints and any action has been initiated by the police. Kindly submit the report at the earliest,” the letter written by a deputy secretary of home department read.Food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal said, “Generally, we do appreciate the work done by any minister in our constituencies and also put up hoardings to thank them. I am not aware of such complaints, but we will surely look into them.”Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kirit Somaiya said he would visit the locations to get more details about the “high-handedness” of local Sena representatives.Sena MP and chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant said, “The CM ordered a probe immediately after the letter by Gadkari. It is yet to be proved if Sena leaders really have any role in this. The Central government is not talking about the hooliganism of elected representatives in Konkan where contractors and officers engaged in Mumbai-Goa highway construction are threatened and beaten up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/may-stop-nhai-work-if-sena-leaders-continue-obstruction-gadkari-to-cm-thackeray-101628959083290.html

The political turmoil in their home country is also worrying 11 Afghan students, who had enroled in Phd or MSc programmes in Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) in 2019. These scholars, who were seen as future policymakers in Afghanistan, now fear instant death at the hands of the Talibani militia, if they manage to return to their homeland. A common belief all of them hold is that the Taliban is just a front for Pakistan and China in these countries’ bid to plunder their mineral-rich homeland of Afghanistan.Noorali Noori, 32, from Parwan province is pursuing PhD in agronomy; he says his family members back home are in hiding. Noori, who lost his father due to Covid-19 in July, says, “The Taliban are pressuring one my relatives to hand over his three teenage daughters or else they will kill all the members in the family.”He added, “If Taliban finds out that I have studied in India, I will be killed along with my children,” said Noori, whose two-year-old younger daughter is suffering from Rett syndrome (a kind of muscular dystrophy among girls). He gets a stipend of ₹18,000 per month. Ahmad Mubasher, 30, of Baghlan province, which is now under Taliban control, says, “My family members are in hiding. I have been disturbed since the current developments began. Taliban want to paralyse the education system of Afghanistan so that no one opposes them. They want to plunder the natural resources of my country.”“Pakistan, who is supporting Taliban must learn that radical and terrorist organisations they are promoting will one day burn down their country,” said Mubasher, who is pursuing PhD in extension education.Habibullah Habibi from Kabul, a third-year PhD in plant breeding said they denounce the kind of Islam being propagated by Taliban. “My family has also had to flee and take shelter with relatives. Islam does not teach suppression of women, beating and killing them in public, picking up girls from houses and imposing dress codes,” he added. “Fortunately my wife and four children are with me, but I am worried about my remaining family members. What will happen to them? I’m concerned about the girls in our family as they are the target of Taliban,” said Habibi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/talibans-advance-in-afghanistan-giving-nightmares-to-phd-students-in-pau-101628958723775.html

The yatras would cover more than 3500 kilometres, touching 120 assembly constituencies.While the seven new ministers would take out these yatras, all lawmakers and local representatives would join in when these yatras pass through their respective areas, state BJP leaders said.The seven new faces from UP in the Modi ministry include six BJP MPs and one from the Apna Dal (Sonelal), a BJP ally.

Bundgarden police station filed a case on Friday. According to the police, the two men are trustees but the board has accused them of posing as decision-making officials of the trust and taking money meant for the trust. “They are both trustees, but the board believes that they have duped the trust,” said sub-inspector Tukaram Fadd of Bundgarden police station who is investigating the case. The Maharashtra government had acquired land belonging to Taboot Inam Endowment trust which is registered with the Waqf Board for a project in Pune. The government was supposed to give around ₹9,64,42,500 to the trust in return and accordingly government had released an amount of ₹7.73 crore to the trust, but upon inquiry later the Waqf board regional officer got to know that the amount did not reach the trust members. The two men posed as office-bearers of Taboot Inam Endowment trust and allegedly made the officials at the Pune collectorate believe that they were decision-making officials of the trust. They accepted a part of the land remuneration from the collector’s office on behalf of the trust into their personal bank accounts. A demand draft of ₹7,76,98,250 issued on January 2 was deposited on January 4 in a private bank account instead of the trust account, according to the complaint in the case. The Waqf officials later approached the Bundgarden police.

After 34 years of service, Yohan had to take voluntary retirement in June 2015 as the medical board of the bank found him incapacitated on account of a medical condition.Thereafter, Arawade applied to the bank for appointment on compassionate grounds, but on March 31, 2018, his plea was rejected only on the ground that his family was not indigent. Nitin had then moved HC.The bank responded to his petition, contending that the ex-employee’s family had received gratuity amount, provident fund accumulations as well as pension and did not need financial support.HC, however, refused to accept the bank’s contention.“We are unable to accede to the submission by the respondent (bank) that because of such payments, an eligible person can be refused compassionate appointment,” said the bench.HC said gratuity, provident fund and monthly pension are legal rights of an employee or his family, if the sole earner has either died in harness or has been medically incapacitated leading to his retirement.“Payment of these amounts cannot be considered as an impediment or an embargo on the appointment of an eligible member of the family on compassionate basis,” the bench observed.HC added that the bank would be justified in in assessing the financial status of the family of an employee, only for granting a one-time financial aid, as an alternative to compassionate appointment under the bank’s scheme.“However, whether, the family is indigent or not, cannot be the basis for refusing compassionate appointment to an otherwise eligible candidate,” the bench said.HC has now directed the bank to consider Arawade’s claim for appointment on compassionate grounds on the basis of his seniority in the list of such candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/compassionate-appointment-can-t-be-denied-only-because-family-is-non-indigent-bombay-hc-101628948941811.html

She was also handed a cheque of ₹25 lakh. Calling her Uttarakhand’s pride, Dhami further said that Katariya as a member of the Indian women’s hockey team for over 10 years, had made everyone proud through her dedication and hard work.The 29-year-old scored a hat-trick at the recently concluded Olympics where the Indian women’s hockey team reached the semi-final for the first time but narrowly missed a medal after losing the bronze medal match to Great Britain.Also Read | 'Nothing but proud': India laud women's hockey team's valiant performance at Tokyo OlympicsOn August 8, Dhami had conferred the Tilu Rauteli award to Katariya – which is given to 22 women annually for their exemplary services.

The Olympics was a litmus test for the past year’s hard work and intense training as a team,” Katariya said, adding that although the Indian women’s hockey team missed the bronze medal, they surely did win “hearts both of people and [the] opposition [team].”After the women’s hockey team lost the bronze medal match at the Olympics, a few people had hurled casteist slurs on Katariya’s family in Haridwar. According to the hockey player’s brother, Chandrashekhar Kataria, two men and some more unknown persons hurled “abusive remarks, blamed Vandana and Dalit players for being responsible for the defeat.”“When we protested they used more abusive language and made fun of us for being Dalits.

14-08-2021||Pune||Pune Startup Mantra: Busting the menstrual hygiene barriers||A customer’s quote is rarely the go-to kickoff in this weekly startup space.However, given the product in question and the “taboo” surrounding the topics of “women’s sexual health” and “menstrual well-being” in India, this customer’s quote best captures the breakthroughs that the startup in question, Safecup, is making in the Indian women’s health market.Mansi Salunkhe, a 21-year-old BTech final year student from Katraj in Pune, and a Safecup user and customer says, “Around a year ago I started reading and looking at videos of menstrual cups. Yet after learning almost everything about the cups, the idea of inserting something inside my vagina was scary. I was seeking a skin treatment for having extra sensitive skin. For years I went through hell due to irritation from sanitary napkins. Finally, I decided to order a menstrual cup. First time insertion and removal can seem daunting, but I was finally successful. I wasn’t able to feel it at all. As a result, I was in love with the cup!”Akarsh Tekriwal is a third-generation entrepreneur who founded Safecup Impact Lab, the company that imports and sells Safecup, in 2019.No IIM or IIT or even terms like “incubation” fit this startup story. Just the hustle-and-flow of a Patna-born Marwadi, with some serious on-the-ground experience in terms of sales, distribution and processes. And, a commitment to, and understanding of women’s sexual health that bodes well for a generation of “woke” entrepreneurs in India.Tekriwal’s Safecup is branded as a “premium menstrual care” product that has 75,000 customers as of today. Tekriwal drops the pithy phrases like “Gynocare revolution” and “The Shameless Company”, all offering an insight into the long game he is attempting to play to become, in his words, “the new-age Unilever.”That means Tekriwal has to convince menstruating women to stop using pads and start using a Safecup, the pitch for which, encompasses not just health benefits, but also environment concerns, given that, according to Tekriwal, not all pads are biodegradble.But first, a change of behaviour for his target customer - a woman on her period.Cue Safecup user Mansi Salunkhe’s closing quote, “You will find people saying it may cause cramps and it may destroy the hymen. Choose your comfort and your body before anything else. I say stop caring about what people will say and start living life to the fullest!”“Opting for a menstrual cup instead of sanitary pads requires a behavioural change. It takes a lot of effort to convince and convert one person into a customer,” says Tekriwal, explaining how he gained the trust and confidence of his customers. “The product needs support. So we have a digital manual along with the product. Any person who wants to understand how to use it, can visit our website and read, or watch videos. We have offered lifetime text-chat support on WhatsApp. We don’t have voice support, as women might be uncomfortable with it,” he adds. Menstrual factsSays Tekriwal, “I did my research before getting into the business of period-hygiene and sexual wellness products. A woman uses between 12 to 20 sanitary pads every month and these are mostly non-biodegradable. With more and more women using non-biodegradable pads, the problem of collection and disposal will get worse. Also, a pad is an external protection which irritates women due to moisture and itchiness.”“Menstrual cup, on the other side, solves all problems – distribution, hygiene and disposal. A woman bleeds about 80ml in the whole period cycle and the menstrual cup can hold between 25ml to 30ml of blood. Even during a heavy flow day, the menstrual cup can suffice. It is also cost-effective as it can be re-used for 60 months. Since it is an internal protection, it is made from medical-grade silicon which can be sterilised and washed with hot water and reused. After understanding the sterilising and washing requirement, we also launched the steriliser product,” Tekriwal added. Because of a taboo, period care product development and awareness is lacking in India, says Tekriwal. “In India, menstrual cups penetration will be a maximum of 20 per cent to 30 per cent, as it requires a behavioural change. It is not related to anyone’s income, but is more personality driven. The outgoing, risk-takers will go for it. Today, the product exists, but is not mainstream. Lifestyle sells and design is a very important aspect. It will take another 20 years for sexual wellness to become mainstream,” he added. In the beginningTekriwal had seen what the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) market is, thanks to his father’s business as a distributor. He learnt his business lessons - number crunching, managing cash flow – from childhood. Says Tekriwal, “The most important thing I learnt was how the distribution channel worked for FMCG products. A brand which is visible to customers, will sell. And to stay alive in the business, one needs to manage the positives and negatives. We stay in the game only if our cash-flow is positive. I learnt these two lessons while growing up.”Tekriwal’s family shifted to Mumbai and then to Pune when his father acquired a small pharma company. Tekriwal, while pursuing his education, started working at the age of 17 to help his father. Says Tekriwal, “My learning started as a salesperson. I visited almost all villages in Pune district and the doctors there. I wanted to learn on the ground and in the process gained communication skills. I did this for almost four years. Then I opted for CA and did my articleship in internal audit. Since, businesses are run on processes and with people, an internal audit is very crucial even, though it is not mandated by law, for companies. I got to work with Quick Heal when they were going in for their IPO initial public offering).”In 2019, Tekriwal then dropped out of formal education and decided to start his own firm. “I wanted to contribute to the society in some way. I had seen rural India and interacted with lots of women and thought I could do something in that domain,” Tekriwal recalls.Tekriwal started distribution of iron tablets to rural women. “In the process, I got to know and understand women’s health issues. We were running a campaign called ‘Red Revolution’ to create awareness on the issue of anaemia. I also understood how periods, sex, and menopause are taboo and societal issues and how they have a real, tangible impact on women’s health. I started looking for an entry point and the right product or service to launch,” said Tekriwal.“I decided to start a ‘for-profit’ social enterprise. Then I found this product called ‘menstrual cup’ to enter into the space.”BootstrappingSays Tekriwal, “I had no clue that I would have a D2C brand and sell it online. My plan was to setup stalls. The money I had was over and I was looking for funding. I to raise ₹30,000. My sister noticed my campaign and told my mother about it. She, in turn, asked my father to help me. But I didn’t want to take money from him. I accepted his money only on the condition I would return it. I got ₹3 lakh and with that I ordered inventory. I was anxious over the first import order, but finally it all went well.”After the inventory landed, Tekriwal did the packaging of the product and decided to setup a stall in Pune Camp. He then drove down to Bengaluru in March 2019 for a women’s event. Tekriwal recalls, “Not a single cup was sold on first day. While I was sitting in a café, I came across an event organiser and asked him to help me. He allowed me to put up a stall at a farmers’ market organised by him in Pune and Bengaluru. Since I could not pay him charges, we decided to revenue share. The first sale happened in Bengaluru.”“Women would inquire about the product, but were unsure about the quality and utility. One of them asked me if I could give her money back if she did not like the product. I assured her on that front and she purchased the cup for ₹1,299. The money-back guarantee changed the game. I was able to sell about 20 menstrual cups at the event and total of 50 in that month. Then I came back to Pune and explored other options to scale up the business. It was then I listed the product on Amazon,” Tekriwal explained.Trust and confidence “Considering the unavailability of raw materials and lack of advanced machinery, medical device manufacturing in India is not easy. So, we decided to opt for US-based manufacturers. User safety is our priority. Our next priority was the sizing guarantee. If a cup does not fit a customer, we send them another cup of different size for free. However, we can’t take the first cup back. So, we ask the customers to cut that cup and send us the images of that product. We need to trust our customers and hence, we offer them no-questions asked replacement and money-back guarantee,” says Tekriwal. From periods to the complete packageApart from offering Period Underwear, Period Cup Steriliser and Washer to its customers, Safecup will now launch sexual wellness products for women.Says Tekriwal, “We have made the product available in 150 stores across Kerala since July this year. In other states, we are available only through our website and Amazon. We would soon launch our first store in Pune, in December this year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-startup-mantra-busting-the-menstrual-hygiene-barriers-101628938740779.html

14-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi government to commission a study on city farmers with aim to boost incomes||The Delhi government will open bids this week to select an agency to commission a research on farming patterns, costs, revenue, farmers’ economic conditions, harvest, sales, access to procurement agents, source of technical advice and awareness of minimum support price (MSP) – with a larger aim of augmenting income for the city’s 21,000 farmers.“The government proposes to conduct a comprehensive research study on pattern on farming and to assess the costing and income from cultivation of major crops in Delhi with objective to know the major crops being grown along with grade and quality, average yield of various crops, main channels of sale, price realisation of the last two years at least both for Kharif and Rabi crops, proportion of tenant farmers, etc,” said a government document, a copy of which HT has seen.The bids are scheduled to be opened on August 20, and within a week, the government plans to commission the research study – which, according to the documents, is supposed to include a detailed survey of at least 1,000 farmers randomly chosen from 25 or more villages scattered across the city. The agency hired for the research is expected to file a detailed report by September 24.According to the records of the city’s agriculture department, the total farmed area in the Capital is around 29,000 hectares, mostly spread in the northern, western and southern peripheries of the city. Most farmers grow seasonal vegetables other than wheat and paddy. The government also estimates the total number of farmers in Delhi at 21,000 currently.“But there is no clarity on what proportion of land is used for cultivation of each. Delhi has also witnessed a decline in cropped area. For instance, till five years ago, it used to be 37,750 hectares. We need to have a good idea of costs incurred by farmers and their incomes,” said a senior government official, adding: “This will be the first such comprehensive study. It is aimed at augmenting incomes of farmers based in the city.”According to the documents seen by HT, the research is also planned to cover details on land holdings, household incomes, crop insurance details, if insurance claimed, source of irrigation, harvest details for period between January and June this year, expenses on diesel, electricity, water, machinery, farming equipment, interest on loans, availability of procurement agencies, source of technical advice and awareness about minimum support price (MSP).MSP is the assured price at which the government buys major farm produce to give farmers assured returns for their yield. It also acts as a base price for private traders. MSP applies to 23 crops, which include paddy and wheat.The study is also expected to cover details on causes of crop loss such as inadequate rainfall, flood, disease, insects, other causes such as fire, locusts, storm, etc along with further details on crop insurance, amount claimed, amount received, time taken to receive the amount, said the documents.It comes at a time when farmers from across states are protesting at the border points of the city against three contentious farm laws passed in the Parliament last year and demanding a law for implementation of MSP. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi has been supporting the farmer groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-government-to-commission-a-study-on-city-farmers-with-aim-to-boost-incomes-101628931971457.html

14-08-2021||Delhi||#IndependenceDay2021: Ditch plastic, opt for eco-friendly Tricolour!||Independence Day is certainly an occasion that deserves to be celebrated. But the exuberance needs to be accompanied with the message of being environment friendly! Recently, the central government prohibited the use of national flags made out of plastic. And several NGOs and non-profit organisations in Delhi-NCR have already been accomplishing the task to make and sell eco-friendly flags at economical prices. Bhavisha Buddhadeo, from the Noida-based NGO Green Society India, is not just making eco-friendly flags, but also spreading awareness among school children about the need to care for the environment. “We want that the flag should not be made out of plastic or plastic straws, but instead with recycled paper or cloth. Iske liye hum flags banake social media ke through bech rahe hain aur sath hi logon ko jagruk bhi kar rahe hain. These flags are priced at ₹20 to ₹30, according to the size. To make them, we first soak the paper and add the three colour, and tulsi or tomato seeds. Or, if there is unused paper such as from a wedding invitation, we use those as well. Our motto is not just to sell these, but create awareness among people. We’ve even tried to use alternatives such as ice cream spoons or broom sticks, to hold it together,” says Buddhadeo. Delhi-based Kritika Saxena, who makes eco-friendly products all round the year, all makes flags from seed paper. She explains, “I started making flags three years ago. The idea is to reduce waste, create and make one time use eco-friendly things that are reasonable as well. Because whenever a product gets a tag of eco-friendly, the price often goes high. I wanted to cater to as many people as possible. The best part of these flags is that you get plants out of it. We operate through WhatsApp and Instagram, to sell them for ₹5. Looking at the overwhelming response, we’ve over the years, we expanded to making eco-friendly greeting cards, diaries and even wedding invites.”An international women’s organisation, Inner Wheel Club, is working with various NGOs in the city to empower women by enabling them to make sustainable flags. “The plastic straw and the plastic flag will remain forever. But, we as citizens of India are responsible for the pollution and the waste we are producing,” says Manisha Kaushik, from the organisation, adding, “This is my passion to bring about whatever little change in the society we can. We are working with different NGOs to make flags out of cloth, and even try to market these for them alongside purchasing and putting them across various societies. We also take it as a social responsibility to work with schools and slums by teaching young kids to make flags by using wooden sticks from brooms, or ice cream sticks.”Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/independenceday2021-ditch-plastic-opt-for-eco-friendly-tricolour-101628928059443.html

14-08-2021||Delhi||#IndependenceDay: Delhiites hit the virtual button for workshops||Independence Day is a great occasion to teach young ones about the struggles of our freedom fighters and the history of how India achieved freedom. In the pre-Covid era, children used to head to schools where August 15 celebrations would entail quite a few activities. But, in absence of that, it’s the love for kites and everything craft that has taken over the bonding time with parents, in Delhi-NCR. A number of virtual, creative workshops for kite making and flag making are being attended by denizens, ahead of August 15. “I’m so glad that we have the option of logging on to virtual classes to learn such creative things such as kite making,” says Priyanka Sinha, a homemaker and mother to five-year-old twins Marvi and Ayansh. “I was happy when I came across such a class because it’s a great way to teach my kids about the country’s history. Also, for me to spend time with my children, beyond giving them school lessons, this is a good excuse. I attend the workshop along with them, and these activities often lead to a lot of discussions between us as we get to learn and explore so much more. It’s great that we can do so much even while sitting at home during the pandemic.” Besides craft workshops, there are also some other I-Day theme activities that are providing the parents and children to get a chance to bond. Sangita Gambhir, from an art and craft studio, says, “Besides the flag making workshop that we are conducting, we also have a food distribution activity as well as a stationery distribution activity, which will be conducted by both adults and children, in Rohini, on the occasion of Independence Day.” Artist Simran Kaur, who is conducting a kite decoration and national symbols workshop for both kids and parents, informs that parents are indeed keen in indulging in these activities as schools are still closed. “We have regular sign ups by those who know we will do something creative. Also, more parents want to join in now as kids love to explore and learn through the play-way!

14-08-2021||Delhi||No Covid-19 death in Delhi for 3rd straight day||The city added no Covid-19 deaths to its toll for the third straight day on Friday, showed state government data, the first time this has happened since May last year, before even the first wave of infections hit the national capital.The state health department’s daily health bulletin on Friday added 50 infections to the city’s tally. The city has, over the past week, added an average of 52 cases every day. The Covid-19 case trajectory, which denotes a region’s infection curve, in the city has now been below 100 for 46 days.At its peak in the third week of April, the seven-day average of new cases soared to a peak of 25,294 a day.The 50 new cases came on the back of 73,324 new tests, at a positivity rate of 0.07%, and took the city’s overall Covid-19 tally to 1,436,988. So far, 25,068 people in Delhi have succumbed to the viral infection. Over 13,200 of them died between April and May alone, as Delhi battled a fourth wave of infectionsPositivity rate is a crucial metric as it shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and when a dropping positivity rate is coupled with decreasing new cases, it indicates that the spread of the virus is reducing within the community. Tracking a region’s positivity rate serves as a good barometer for whether cases are going to increase or decrease in the coming days.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control. In Delhi, this number has been below the threshold for 85 days now, and below 1% for 75.At the peak of the fourth wave of infections in Delhi during the third week of April, this statistic soared past 36%.As on Friday, 468 people in Delhi are currently battling the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-covid-19-death-in-delhi-for-3rd-straight-day-101628897100323.html
14-08-2021||Delhi||Cops to court: No proof yet to confirm 9-year-old in Delhi was raped||The Delhi Police have informed a city court that it is yet to find any evidence to confirm that a nine-year-old Dalit girl was raped before she was allegedly murdered and forcibly cremated at a village near the cantonment on August 1.The investigating officer (IO), Richhpal Singh, also told the court that at this stage, it was not possible to conclusively say that the victim was raped. Four men have been arrested for the crime and are in jail.On a specific query by additional sessions judge Ashutosh Kumar, the IO told the court that he cannot “conclusively” say as to whether the victim was sexually assaulted before allegedly being murdered.“The IO has further admitted that neither any statement of any eye-witness nor any other evidence, including medical or scientific, could be collected so far to confirm as to whether the victim child was raped or not. He has further submitted that at this stage, he cannot conclusively say as to whether the victim child was raped or not,” the court noted in its order of August 12.In his report, the IO also told the court that as per the post mortem of the victim conducted on August 3, “no definite opinion can be ascertained with regard to any sexual assault on the body of the deceased”.“...but it is very clear that the body was burnt after the death of the deceased,” the IO said in his report.The police also said that it only had the disclosure statement of two of the four accused admitting to the crime.“..the IO has stated that the disclosure statements of the four accused persons have revealed that accused Radhey Shyam and Kuldeep Singh had raped & killed the minor child victim and that the remaining two accused, namely Salim Ahmad and Laxmi Narayan, had helped them in trying to cremate the deceased minor child,” said the bench in its order.Radhe Shyam, the priest at the local crematorium where the victim’s remains were found, is the prime accused in the case.The police claimed that Shyam and Singh, in their disclosure statements, admitted to raping the victim. But under the Indian Evidence Act, disclosure statement or confessions made to a police officer is not admissible if not supported by additional evidence.The submissions were made while hearing an application by the New Delhi District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) seeking compensation for the victim’s family according to the state compensation scheme.On August 1, the Dalit girl was raped and killed allegedly by a priest and three of his male associates at a crematorium in Purani Nangal village near Delhi cantonment in southwest Delhi. The four men then cremated her body allegedly without her parents’ consent or the police being informed.The accused say the girl died of electrocution while fetching water from a cooler but the family alleges that the suspects hurriedly cremated the body after raping her.Village residents and Dalit groups blocked local roads and protested against the crime for days, prompting prominent Opposition politicians to visit the family and announce compensation. The accused have been booked under sections 302 (murder), 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code, along with the relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act .On August 4, the autopsy of the victim’s body had come back inconclusive for rape. At the time, the three-member medical board conducting the autopsy told police that it will be impossible to arrive at a conclusion because only charred remains were available for them to examine.The victim’s parents, through advocate Jitendra Kumar Jha, have moved the Delhi high court seeking a judicial probe into the alleged laxity of the police officials in conducting the preliminary probe, while also urging for an SIT investigation in the alleged rape and murder.“We have already filed a petition on the administrative failure in conducting the initial probe and delay in registration. It is being processed by the registry and might get cleared by Monday,” Jha told HT.On Thursday, the court awarded an interim compensation of ₹2.5 lakh to the parents for the loss of life of the minor girl. However, the judge refused to give any interim relief for the alleged rape of the victim noting that the IO was not sure whether the assault happened or not.“As regards the interim compensation on the additional ground of the alleged rape of the victim, in view of the submissions of the IO and in view of the fact that the investigating agency itself is not sure as to whether the victim was raped or not, the interim compensation qua the same is not allowed at this stage”.“However, liberty is granted to move a fresh application to that regard, in case the investigating agency collects further material or comes to the conclusion that the victim child was raped,” the court said in its order.As per the government’s victim compensation scheme, the maximum compensation awardable in case of loss of life is ₹10 lakh. The court granted 25 per cent of the compensation amount as interim relief.On Thursday, the court also sent the accused to 14-days judicial custody after they were produced at the end of their three days custodial investigation.The incident sparked uproar, following which several people, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal met the victim’s parents.Gandhi tweeted pictures with the parents on August 4, following which his Twitter account was locked by the social media company for violating India’s laws on not identifying rape victims.Kejriwal ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident, announced financial assistance of ₹10 lakh for the girl’s family and said the city government would appoint top lawyers to represent them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cops-to-court-no-proof-yet-to-confirm-9-year-old-was-raped-101628890569183.html
14-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The new Iron Lady||This role, to her, is both familiar and strange. Familiar, because being a working woman is by no means a novel experience. She has been “working, working, working” all her adult life, mostly administering her home in Lakshmi Nagar. Strange, because only recently did she start to step out everyday into the big wide world as the family’s sole breadwinner.Devki is the new face of an old landmark. She succeeds husband Radhe Shyam as an ironing service provider in the Capital’s upscale Nizamuddin East. He was managing the household laundry of a part of the neighbourhood for more than a decade — his stall under a khirni tree in the C-block park comprised a table and a sooty black iron. He died of a heart attack in April, leaving behind three children and Devki, who is 45.“One moment he was fine, the next moment he was no more,” says Devki. This sweltering afternoon, clad in a pink kurta and an orange salwar, she is standing on the exact spot where her husband would stand. A rad awning is blocking the unforgiving sun. The stall is unchanged except for the new gas-fuelled iron. The husband’s coal-fired press was so huge that it looked like a mini steam engine. “Its handle would get hot very quickly and burn my hands,” she says, showing the blisters on her fingers.Meanwhile, Devki’s older son is quietly watching her speak, his gaze full of protective love. “He wants to be by his mummy’s side these days,” she explains. Atul recently cleared his 12th standard and is aiming for university education. Daughter Parul, a Master’s student in history, is simultaneously building a career in nursing. The youngest, Anmol, is a school student.The days following Radhe Shyam’s death passed in a blur of shock and grief. “I would cry all the time.” Realising that she must help the children get on with life, she eventually took up the husband’s profession in July. The long-time patrons showed solidarity by staying loyal to the establishment. Devki irons about 100 clothes daily. The work is demanding and her shoulders start aching by the day’s end, but it is helping her to come to terms with the great loss. “When I’m here I’ve less khali (spare) time to think of my grief… at home, I still sometimes cry.”The stall was founded by Radhe Shyam’s grandfather, Nanhe Ram, 60 years ago. It later passed to his widowed mother, Draupadi, who ironed the clothes here for 30 years. Radhe Shyam took over in 2010.Devki leaves her house every morning at 9, after preparing lunch for the family. She returns 12 hours later. Her daughter keeps the night meal ready.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-new-iron-lady-101628890889925.html

As the special investigation team (SIT) could not find any substantial evidence against him in its probe that was completed a few months ago, the court granted him bail. “Seeking cancellation of the bail, we have filed a review petition in the court,” a police statement said on Friday. Rajeev Joshi (51), owner of RC Joshi and Company, Ludhiana, was arrested by the police for allegedly supplying two drums of methyl alcohol to Ravinder Singh, alias Pinka of Moga, also an accused. The police had said the methyl alcohol was further used for preparing spurious illicit liquor. Earlier, during the case hearing, Joshi’s counsel argued that his client was falsely implicated in the case. It was Joshi’s second bail application. Earlier, his first bail plea was rejected by court considering “seriousness” of the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2020-hooch-deaths-police-challenges-bail-to-ludhiana-bizman-101628885756084.html

For the last one week, the average daily hospital admissions stand at 3,000, but 2,000 patients are getting discharged on an average, maintaining the active caseload steady, statistics show. As the state is resorting to targeted testing, many experts have asked it to do random testing and double the testing rate.

Though the festive season has begun, it will peak with Thiru Onam on Aug 21. “Post-Onam surge can be expected in the state. Therefore, it is best to keep social bubble minimum this season,” said Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, senior consultant and public health activist. State health minister Veena George has also asked people to be more vigilant. “Though cases are on the rise, the situation is under control. There is no need to panic. Our effort is to vaccinate maximum people and the Centre was approached for more doses,” she said. The state health ministry said 2,28,29,007 people were given vaccination till Thursday. Out of these, 1,58,70, 802 were given first dose and the rest got both doses. Of the total population, 45.5% were given first dose and 18.41% both the doses.

However, the second wave has waned in the state and city, allowing more such public events despite the threat of the pandemic still looming large and just as potent as ever before.The Basavaraj Bommai-led state government has issued orders to mute any mass gatherings for the upcoming festivals but continues to turn a blind eye on political events.There were over a thousand people with no masks or social distancing at the swearing in ceremony of Bommai’s cabinet in Raj Bhavan, the Karnataka Governor’s official residence, on August 4.Karnataka has seen a marginal increase in new infections, which experts and others have indicated as a sign of the imminent third wave.The state government has tightened vigil and checks at both Kerala and Maharashtra borders but has left most of Bengaluru, which houses around a quarter of the state’s over 70 million population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bluru-civic-body-to-honour-100-covid-warriors-on-august-15-101628884434954.html

Our goal is to utilise the state’s natural resources and create an industrial employment revolution,” Nirani added.Karnataka, like its counterparts has seen many of its public sector units fail to perform and cease to be operational. Bengaluru is a city that has among the highest number of public sector units in the country for aerospace, electronics, defence, railways, telecommunications and several other industries that was one of the bedrocks on which the city has now grown into one of the most lucrative technology ecosystems in the world.Karnataka gets a significant share of India’s total foreign direct investment (FDI) and some of the largest corporations in the world have a presence in Bengaluru, which has other monikers like “India’s IT capital”, “Knowledge Capital” , “startup hub” and other names which makes it an attractive destination.Karnataka stands 4th in merchandise exports in the national export basket. Exports from the state stood at around $15 bn in 2019-20 which is 5.2% of India’s total exports. The state stands third among Indian states in terms of FDI inflows contributing 14.27% of total FDI inflow (as of March 2021).However, acquisition of land, corruption and red tape among other issues has added to the state’s challenges over the decades.The delays in procuring land for industries under Section 109 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act had cost Karnataka a chance to convert investments totalling over ₹39,000 crore and a chance to create over 80,000 jobs between 2013 and 2019, Mint reported in November 2019.The Act has since been amended along with other changes to industrial and labour laws to make it more attractive for investors to fund projects in Karnataka. The government has also announced to hold the Global Investors Meet (GIM) in February 2022, a biennial event until 2016, which was put off following the political uncertainty in the state.Nirani added that any misuse of land allotted by the government would be probed.He has also assured to put to use around 3,000 acres of unused land in Kolar Gold Fields, which have been exploited for centuries before losing most of its prized minerals.“There are more than 3,000 acres of unused land in KGF. They used to get 40 grams of gold for one tonne of mining but now it has dwindled. The officials in their findings have declared that there is no scope for exploration in 3,200 acres of land. So we have urged the Centre to hand over that land to the state government. Revenue officials have been instructed to consider this. We will set up Industrial Township when we get the land,” he said.The last two years have been particularly bad for Karnataka, a calamity-prone state, which has seen the extremes of floods and droughts, coupled with the Covid-19 situation further strap it for funds and other developmental works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ktaka-looks-to-revive-sick-psus-in-a-bid-to-restore-economy-101628884374965.html

However, former Olympians say that though the announcement is in the right direction, it all boils down to the execution. A former Olympian, requesting anonymity, said: “It’s a welcoming gesture, but now it’s all about trying to get it done”. He added that the reason why the state government is keen on such a programme is also because Karnataka had just three participants in the just concluded Tokyo Olympics. India had sent its largest-ever contingent of 126 athletes across 18 different sport disciplines to Tokyo, which also became India’s most successful outing in the games ever with seven medals, including one gold in Javelin. Karnataka, that has produced some of the most successful hockey players over the decades among other athletes in various disciplines has seen the quality of the sport come down over the years, largely due to red tape, a pattern seen in other states as well. For the last nearly two decades, the head of Karnataka’s Olympic Association (KOA) has been headed by K Govindaraj, a Congress politician. Govindraj took charge of KOA after his earlier stint as secretary of Karnataka Basketball Association. According to the description of Govindraj in the KOA, he has transformed the body from “receiving” organization to a “giving entity”. “Time was when the KOA sought government funds to even train sportspersons from Karnataka for the state games or the national games. But not any more. The KOA has initiated a number of measures beneficial to the sporting fraternity of the state,” according to the KOA.However, the on-ground realities have painted a different picture as sports personalities losing out on opportunities for want of basic facilities is a story all of India’s athletes share. MP Ganesh, one of Karnataka and India’s most celebrated Olympians, said that it takes a minimum of eight years to get someone ready for the Olympics if they are not already in the national circuit in their respective sport. Ganesh was an integral part of India’s hockey team and was part of the bronze winning side in Barcelona in 1971 and participated in 1972 Munich Olympics. He said that the government and authorities should fix its associations, support mechanism, technically qualified staff to identify talent and infrastructure among other requirements starting from the very basics. “In my opinion, ₹5 lakh is a very meager amount,” he said. He added that the government should be more aware of the ground realities before announcing such schemes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ktaka-chalks-out-programme-to-send-100-athletes-for-2024-paris-olympics-101628884015689.html

Apart from Bassi, the Kapurthala police had booked four supply inspectors Vivek Sharma, Bhupinder Singh, Vikas Sethi and Rameshwar Singh in the case. Official documents reveal that Bassi had joined as AFSO in Sultanpur Lodhi on January 25, 2021, and sought records of the Khera storage stock from the circle office of the department but the inspectors failed to reply to his letters. Bassi then conducted an inspection on March 4 and found nearly 25,000 quintals of wheat grain missing from the stock. He had sent a report regarding this to the district food supply controller, Geeta Bishambhu, who then sought explanation from the four inspectors. In June this year, Bishambhu conducted a probe after Sultanpur Lodhi MLA Navtej Singh Cheema and members of the Kisan Union lodged multiple complaints over non-disbursement of wheat between October 2020 and March 2021. During the probe, the Sultanpur Lodhi centre reportedly didn’t provide records of wheat distribution to the inspection teams despite repeated orders, thus making them guilty of “grave negligence”. On July 26, Bishambhu wrote to senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harkamalpreet Singh Khakh for legal action against Vivek Sharma and Bhupinder Singh. When contacted, Bishambhu confirmed that ASFO Bassi had no role in the scam while two food inspectors -- Vivek Sharma and Bhupinder Singh -- were responsible for embezzlement. The rest of the accused may be liable for department inquiry for lapses in wheat distribution as they were posted here during the said period. Sultanpur Lodhi deputy superintendent of police Sarwan Singh Bal said, “We are not arresting any accused at this stage but are recording the statements of the food and civil supply department officials. After gathering the evidence, we will remove names of any persons found innocent.” AAP demands CBI or HC judge probe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Sajjan Singh Cheema, while addressing a press conference here in Jalandhar on Friday, demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or a high court judge in the scam. Cheema said one of the accused food inspectors, Vivek Sharma, had faced similar charges last year too and was booked by the police for cheating but no action was taken against him, and he continued to be posted at Sultanpur Lodhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sultanpur-lodhi-wheat-pilferage-whistle-blower-officer-s-name-figures-among-accused-in-fir-101628883835502.html

14-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra governor duty-bound to decide on 12 nominated MLCs in reasonable time, says Bombay high court||It is the duty of Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to declare his decision on nomination of 12 members of legislative Council (MLC) within reasonable time and failure to do so defeats the statutory intent, the Bombay high court said on Friday, while passing an order on a petition seeking declaration that the inaction was in breach of constitutional provisions.The HC said as the list of nominees was forwarded to the governor by the council of ministers on November 6, 2020, the governor should have communicated his reservations about the list to the chief minister, rather than keeping the posts of MLCs vacant indefinitely. The court held that the governor should speak with the chief minister and let him know about his reservations on the list of nominees, if any, within reasonable timeA division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while pronouncing the judgment in the public interest litigation filed by Nashik resident Ratan Luth said, “We declare the public law that there is obligation on the Governor to accept or return the recommendation made as part of advice has to be decided within reasonable time and eight months is sufficient time in the present facts.” Arguing for the petitioner, senior advocate Aspi Chinoy had submitted that the governor’s failure was arbitrary, malafide and deprived the legislative council of the benefit of such nominees having special knowledge in various fields. Chinoy had submitted that by not taking a decision the governor had caused a loss to the general public. The list submitted to the governor included the names of Vijay Karanjkar, Urmila Matondkar, Nitin Bangude-Patil and Chandrakant Raghuvanshi from the Shiv Sena; Eknath Khadse, Raju Shetti, Yashpal Bhinge and Anand Shinde from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP); and Rajni Patil, Sachin Sawant, Anniruddha Vankar and Muzaffar Hussain from the Congress. The state, through senior counsel Rafiq Dada, had submitted that the governor was duty-bound to make nominations strictly based on the advice of the council of ministers and he had to either accept or reject the names and there was no third option, but the governor had not respected the recommendation and deprived the citizens of benefit of such persons. The centre through additional solicitor general Anil Singh had submitted that while Article 171 of the Constitution granted the power to the Governor of a state to nominate members it also allowed him to use his discretion on the same. While pronouncing the judgement, CJ Datta said, “Though the governor might have genuine reasons not to convey his decision earlier, the issue has to be resolved at the earliest. Whatever be the reason, it is time that the impasse is resolved. Eight months seems to be beyond reasonable time.” While referring to the difference in opinions that may arise between the governor and the CM the bench said, “It is mature, sensible and responsible governance both at the centre as well as in the state that the people look upto. Should there be any misunderstanding between two constitutional authorities or functionaries, the right steps in the correct direction ought to follow.” The bench opined that the offices of Governor, CM and ministers are “entitled to respect from each other in fair measure’ despite ‘ever-expanding uncertainties of political unrest“. The court held that the constitutional functionaries and authorities, “ought to stand tall and rise above all differences of opinion” and “arrive at workable solution as quickly as possible”.“It would not behove the dignity, prestige and majesty of the office of a Constitutional authority/functionary to take shelter of absence of a time limit to act in terms of a provision of the Constitution, so as to defend an inaction when it is challenged in a Constitutional court,” the bench said. It added, “It is with the prompt and effective resolution of differences of opinion to take the nation forward that the respective incumbents would glorify the offices they hold, and not otherwise.”The court concluded the judgement stating, “We will consider it eminently desirable if a decision is taken soon. We hope and trust that things will be set right at an early date.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-governor-duty-bound-to-decide-on-12-nominated-mlcs-in-reasonable-time-says-bombay-high-court-101628882763571.html

14-08-2021||Chandigarh||Majithia seeks sacking of Ashu for allowing wheat from outside state||ChandigarhThe Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Friday demanded immediate sacking of Punjab food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu for allegedly allowing wheat from outside the state to be procured on MSP in Punjab.The Akali leader also demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the functioning of department officials, including its chief vigilance commissioner.Addressing a press conference here, the former minister alleged that wheat was brought from outside the state at ₹1,000 per quintal and sold at ₹1,883. Majithia said the minister was responsible for appointing a tainted officer as the chief vigilance commissioner. He said the officer, Rakesh Singla, was indicted in October 2017 by the principal secretary of the department, who held him responsible for a corruption of ₹85 crore. He said the principal secretary had ordered that Singla be demoted and also accused him of diverting stock received from the Centre under various schemes. He said Ashu did not only appoint Singla as the CVC but also gave him charge of transportation and labour involving an annual budget of ₹600 crore.He also held Ashu responsible for alleged corruption by a department inspector, Jasdev Singh, nephew of Ghanaur MLA Madan Lal Jalalpur. The Akali leader alleged that Jasdev had been given the charge of eight godowns instead of two, which was the norm, and he allegedly misappropriated 87,000 quintals of wheat worth ₹20 crore. “Jalalpur was now claiming that his nephew was mentally upset, but it is a mystery as to how a mentally unsound person sold off his properties and disappeared with his family. It is clear that Jalalpur is involved in the scandal. No action is being taken in the case as he now has the patronage of the new state Congress chief, Navjot Singh Sidhu,” Majithia alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/majithia-seeks-sacking-of-ashu-for-allowing-wheat-from-outside-state-101628882643971.html

The Board stated that all birds must be procured from authorised sellers registered under Pet Shop Rules 2018. “Till today, no pet shop has been registered by animal welfare boards in Haryana and Punjab or by the Chandigarh administration,” the board added.Further, the board mentions aerial birds covered under various schedules of the Wildlife Protection Act and special permissions needed from the wildlife department.Speaking about the reply, Garg said, “The administration has not taken note of the recommendations made earlier and we hope that the UT adviser now acts on them. The department must place all permissions and documents related to this aviary in the public domain.”Meanwhile, UT forest department Officials said they have taken all the necessary permissions and will replying to the letters sent by the board and Gandhi.However, not all residents are against the aviary. Convener of City Forum of Residents Welfare Organizations (CFORWO) Vinod Vashisht said, “An aviary is not a cage. Unlike cages, there will be a large space for birds to fly.

14-08-2021||Chandigarh||Panjab University defers senate polls for graduate constituency||In the ongoing senate elections, Panjab University on Friday deferred the polling for the registered graduate constituency, which was scheduled on August 18. Polling for the constituencies of heads and teachers of arts colleges will be held as per the schedule on that date. The varsity said the decision was taken for the “time being” in view of the non-availability of required polling booths in Punjab and Haryana. Polling has taken place for four constituencies out of the eight so far. A total of 47 senators are to be elected, out of which elections have taken place for 10. The registered graduate constituency is the largest with around 3.61 lakh voters, who elect 15 members to the senate. Polling booths are set up across seven states/UTs. The varsity on Thursday had also informed the high court that it might have to defer polls as there are certain difficulties being faced, including non-availability of buildings to hold the elections according to the Covid-19 protocol. The court was hearing an appeal from PU, in which it had challenged a single-judge order asking the varsity to hold the senate polls in two months. The court observed that it has full faith in the vice-chancellor and appreciates his efforts for holding the elections. “However, we would observe that the sanctity of the election schedule qua this election be also maintained unless there is an exigency which is beyond the control of the vice-chancellor himself,” the court said. The lawyer appearing for seven former senators had also raised apprehensions and some technical issues about faculty polls scheduled for August 23. Satya Pal Jain, appearing for PU, had submitted that faith should be reposed in the vice-chancellor and the returning officer and no direction is required to be issued. He had also asserted that the court should not dictate the holding of the elections or its schedule. The bench observed that it is guided by the law and principles as laid down in the rulings and would, therefore, adhere to the laid down parameters. The court further stated that it has no doubt in the capacity and capability of the vice-chancellor and is confident that he would not leave any stone unturned to hold the elections as per the schedule. It also termed former senators’ apprehensions “unfounded” taking note of how elections have proceeded so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panjab-university-defers-senate-polls-for-graduate-constituency-101628882635494.html
14-08-2021||Mumbai||Covid in Maharashtra: Three more Delta Plus related deaths, tally now five||Three more deaths linked to the Delta Plus variant of the novel coronavirus were reported from Maharashtra on Friday, taking the total count to five. The deceased –all senior citizens – were from Raigad, Beed and Ratnagiri districts. The Raigad patient was a 69-year-old journalist from Nagothane. He had diabetes and hypertension and was admitted to a civil hospital for nearly 17 days. He succumbed on July 22. According to civil surgeon Dr Suhas Mane, the deceased was fully vaccinated in May. During the contact-tracing exercise, the Raigad health officials found four family members of the journalist infected with Covid-19. “We have sent their samples for genome sequencing. However, none of them had severe disease and all of them recovered at home,” said Raigad’s district health officer Dr Sudhakar More. The deceased from Beed was a 78-year-old man, who was hospitalised on June 5 and discharged on June 29. He succumbed at his home on July 5. “He did not have any known comorbid conditions. He had recovered and gone home, but died suddenly,” said Dr Raus Shaikh, acting district health officer of Beed, adding that he was unvaccinated. None of his contacts have tested positive for Covid-19. The fatality from Ratnagiri was a 73-year-old man from Sangameshwar taluka. While health officials could not get his vaccination details, they said that he was admitted to Mumbai’s St George Hospital for treatment and had succumbed on May 29. Maharashtra’s first Delta Plus fatality – an 80-year-old woman – was also from Ratnagiri’s Sangameshwar taluka. Since then, 12 Delta Plus cases have been identified from the district and a majority are from Sangameshwar. The state’s second death was a 63-year-old fully vaccinated woman from Mumbai. The total number of Delta Plus cases from Maharashtra now stands at 66, including a latest patient identified from Thane district. Delta Plus or AY.1 is a mutation of the highly transmissible Delta variant (B.1.617.2). More than 80% of samples from Maharashtra have the Delta variant, labelled as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization in May. The Delta Plus was labelled as a variant of concern by the Union Health Ministry in June. Two of the three Delta Plus deaths in Maharashtra – the latest one from Raigad and the one from Mumbai – have been reported in fully vaccinated people. Covid-19 infections that occur 14 days after being fully vaccinated are known as breakthrough infections. “Vaccines are an important tool to fight the ongoing pandemic as they reduce the risk of infection as well as complications,” said infectious disease expert Dr Om Shrivastav, who is also a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force. “But the chances of re-infection or breakthrough infections remain, which is why one must continue to adhere to Covid norms such as wearing a mask, washing hands and maintaining a physical distance. People with comorbid conditions have to be even more careful,” he said. According to Shrivastav, the United States has been struggling with a lot of Delta and Delta Plus cases. “We don’t know how intense our third wave will be. Therefore, we should not be complacent on any aspects related to the pandemic,” he said. Some experts said that the variants and related deaths highlight the need for booster doses of the vaccine, especially for the immunocompromised population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-in-maharashtra-three-more-delta-plus-related-deaths-tally-now-five-101628882576647.html

14-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Police crack murder of elderly woman in Sector 8||Chandigarh Police have cracked the blind murder of a 98-year-old woman in Sector 8 within a week with the arrest of a 31-year-old man who lives in servants’ quarters in the same area.The suspect has been identified as Kailash Bhatt, who belongs to Almora in Uttarakhand and works as a cook at a house in Sector 15. He stays with him wife at a house in Sector 8, where she works as a domestic help, said police during a press conference on Friday.Victim Joginder Kaur was found murdered with her throat slit at her house last Friday. Her domestic help was the one to call police around 8:15pm after she found the body on returning from a two-hour-long walk. The kitchen knife used for the murder was recovered from the spot. No valuables were found missing though the house had been ransacked. According to police, financial distress led the suspect to the crime. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal said Bhatt had lost his job due to the pandemic and remained without work for long. “He also had a son around the same time (who is now 18-month-old), had purchased a bike recently, and had to repay a debt of about ₹2.5 lakh,” he said.While police had scanned CCTV footage and mobile data dump of the area to get leads, it was the “human intelligence” that helped them track the killer. “We talked to various residents and their domestic helps, which pointed us to the accused,” said Chahal.What transpired that dayAccording to police, Bhatt knew the victim’s domestic help as both were from the same community. He had even carried out a recce and knew that nobody except the elderly woman would be at home at the time of the crime.Bhatt’s wife had gone to meet her relatives when he struck at Kaur’s house. He first entered the servants’ quarters from the front side and stole ₹800 and some jewellery, said police. Kaur apparently saw him leaving the quarters, and he later returned and killed her.According to information gathered by police, Kaur was seen talking to him as he came out of the servants’ quarters.Police have recovered the bloodstained clothes that he had worn that day. They have been sent for forensic testing. Bhatt will be produced in court, where police will seek his remand for further investigations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-police-crack-murder-of-elderly-woman-in-sector-8-101628881976442.html

14-08-2021||Mumbai||Sexual harassment claims politically motivated to destroy career: Ex- Maharashtra min||A day after allegations of sexual harassment were levelled against former Maharashtra forest minister Sanjay Rathod, the Shiv Sena legislator dismissed the charges and said they were politically motivated to destroy his social and political career. In February, Rathod, a four-term Sena legislator, was linked to the death by suicide of a young woman from Pune. The incident had led to his resignation from the cabinet. While he is trying to regain the lost cabinet berth, fresh allegations have surfaced against him.On Thursday, Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vice-president Chitra Wagh tweeted a photo of a complaint letter of a woman who alleged Rathod of sexually harassing her for re-employing her husband at an organisation that was headed by the former minister. Her husband reportedly claimed that his colleague in the school also got threatening messages and a complaint was registered with the police. Terming the allegations as serious, Wagh had sought action against Rathod. Speaking to media persons in Yavatmal on Friday, Rathod said, “The complainant’s husband was recruited as a teacher on a temporary basis in a Yavatmal school. However, he resigned in 2017. But since March, he has been requesting [the authorities] to take him back on the job. However, the school administration informed him that the matter pertaining to the recruitment was sub-judice.” “Later, I started getting messages from unknown numbers threatening to destroy my social and political career, and mentioning that they have the support of my political opponents. Why did he keep quiet for four years from 2017 and woke up now all of a sudden? So, all these allegations are baseless, politically motivated and made out of frustration,” he added. In February too, Wagh had campaigned for Rathod’s removal after his name cropped up in the suicide case. The woman, a resident of Beed, had died by suicide at a flat in Pune’s Hadapsar. After her death, several photos and audio clips surfaced, allegedly linking Rathod to her death. Twenty days after he came under the scanner, Rathod resigned on February 28||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sexual-harassment-claims-politically-motivated-to-destroy-career-ex-maharashtra-min-101628881798399.html
14-08-2021||Chandigarh||No plan to divest Punjab governor of Chandigarh’s charge: MHA||The Union home ministry on Friday made it clear that there is no proposal under its consideration to divest the Punjab governor of responsibility as the administrator of Chandigarh.The home ministry also denied Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal’s claim that he raised the issue with Union home minister Amit Shah and termed the former’s apprehension with regard to the Chandigarh administrator “unfounded”.In a series of tweets on Thursday, Sukhbir said he had requested Shah to review the Union government’s decision to appoint a full-fledged administrator for Chandigarh by divesting the Punjab governor of the charge, while calling it another attempt to “dilute” the state’s claim to its capital city. Sukhbir had met Shah on Wednesday evening. “It is clarified that the Union government has not taken any decision of divesting the Punjab governor of this responsibility of Chandigarh administrator; and, neither is any such proposal under contemplation. It is also clarified that Sukhbir Singh Badal has not raised this issue with the Union home minister,” a home ministry spokesperson said.With VP Singh Badnore set to complete his five-year tenure on the gubernatorial post later this month, speculation was rife that the Centre could divest the next Punjab governor of the charge of UT administrator and appoint a an exclusive administrator for Chandigarh. Sukhbir’s claims in the recent days had further fuelled the debate.A brief historyFrom 1952 to 1966 (the year Haryana was carved out of Punjab), Chandigarh was the capital of Punjab. Citizens of the city were represented in the state’s legislative assembly and a chief commissioner headed the local administration. When Punjab was divided, both Punjab and Haryana claimed the new city for its capital. Pending resolution of the issue, the Union government made Chandigarh a Union Territory with its administration functioning directly under the Centre. The practice of appointing an administrator of the UT designated as chief commissioner continued till May 31, 1984. At the time of insurgency in Punjab, the Union government decided to transfer the administrator’s role to the Punjab governor. On June 1, 1984, the Punjab governor took over the direct administration of the UT as the administrator, and the chief commissioner was redesignated as the adviser to the administrator. Both the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party, from time to time, have demanded greater democratic participation in the city’s governance rather than officialdom, without taking a clear stand on whether the UT should have an exclusive administrator or the Punjab governor should continue performing that role. In recent days, former Congress MP Pawan Bansal has floated the idea of a metropolitan council, while former BJP MP Satya Pal Jain advocated a system where the major role in decision making is that of citizens rather than bureaucrats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-plan-to-divest-punjab-governor-of-chandigarh-s-charge-mha-101628881796956.html
14-08-2021||Chandigarh||15 years on, terrorism rearing its head in Jammu again||While Kashmir remains the hotbed of militancy, the relatively peaceful Jammu region has also seen a resurgence in terror activities this year. At the peak of militancy, Jammu region, comprising 10 districts, had also witnessed selective killings and massacres. However, the violence had been consistently waning since 2004-05, with stray incidents reported once in a while. After the revocation of Articles 370 and 35-A on August 5, 2019, there was a thaw in terror activities for a year. However, terrorism seems to have picked up momentum yet again. Former director general of police SP Vaid, who also served as the inspector general of police for Jammu region, said, “Jammu is definitely seeing a resurgence in terror activities. Pakistan’s intelligence agency, ISI, wants to disturb Jammu because of the religious pluralism of the region. For instance, if there is a grenade attack in Kashmir and 10 civilians are injured then there is a backlash on terrorists in the Valley. However, Jammu has a mixed population.” “The recent terror attacks are proof that Pakistan is putting all its efforts to revive terrorism in Jammu region,” said Dr Vaid. Since January, terror activities have been witnessed in Rajouri, Poonch, Reasi, Jammu, Kishtwar, Doda, Ramban, Samba and Kathua districts. Pak does not want BJP strengthening its foothold in Valley: Ex-DGP “A new security threat has also emerged in the form of drones along the 200-km international border from Kathua to Akhnoor. Drones are being used to drop arms, IEDs, drugs and money. Tunnels are also being dug to push terrorists in Jammu. ISI has ‘contacts’ in Jammu region and it has started reactivating them besides harnessing new ones to de-stabilise the region,” the former DGP said. “Following August 5, 2019, Pakistan failed to create disturbances in Kashmir so it is trying to create chaos in Jammu to sabotage the political process initiated by the Centre so that Pakistan can claim that there is no democracy in Jammu and Kashmir.” On political killings, especially of BJP leaders and functionaries, Dr Vaid said, “Pakistan does not want to see BJP strengthening its foothold in Kashmir. Therefore, Pakistan has launched a vicious campaign against the BJP in Kashmir.” Intelligence inputs say there my be more intrusion bids: DGP Dilbag Singh Director general of police Dilbag Singh said, “After the February 25 ceasefire agreement between the two DGMOs, infiltration had come down to zero and there was no cross-border shelling either. However, unfortunately, terrorists have been infiltrating into India, especially from the Rajouri-Poonch sector”.“Recently, there were three encounters in Rajouri sector — Daddal in Nowshera, Sunderbani and Pangai in Thannamandi. All these were fresh groups. Intelligence inputs suugest the infiltration has resumed and more such intrusion bids are likely to follow,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/15-years-on-terrorism-rearing-its-head-in-jammu-again-101628881617371.html
14-08-2021||Mumbai||Marathi manoos can take on any oppressor: Maharashtra CM||Raking the sons-of-the-soil issue, Shiv Sena chief and Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said that the ‘Marathi manoos’ always fights against injustice. In a veiled attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Thackeray said that the Marathi manoos may be called lazy or may not be enterprising, but they have the strength to attack an oppressor, no matter how big it might be.The Sena chief, who was speaking on the 61st anniversary of Marmik – a weekly cartoon magazine – said that Sena patriarch and his father late Bal Thackeray had started it when “outsiders were encroaching upon the rights of Marathi manoos” in Mumbai.“Marathi manoos might be called lazy by some, they might not be an entrepreneur, but Marathi manoos never backs away from a fight against injustice. No matter how big the oppressor, from generations, Marathi manoos has always shown the strength to attack them against injustice. That strength was there, it is there, and will remain tomorrow as well,” the Sena chief said.Thackeray’s statements gain significance, given the party has taken up the sons-of-the-soil agenda to counter BJP in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls next February. The Sena has used the Marathi manoos plank in two recent incidents – when Sena-BJP workers clashed outside Sena Bhavan and after BJP leader Prasad Lad made a controversial statement saying that if the time comes they will demolish the Sena Bhavan.In his speech for the event held virtually, Thackeray recalled Marmik’s journey and how his grandfather Prabhodhankar, father and his uncle Srikant were involved in the Samyukta Maharashtra (United Maharashtra) movement for the creation of a separate state. He said that through the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, they attained Mumbai.“Initially the role of Marmik was to entertain Marathi manoos, but looking at the situation where outsiders encroached upon the rights of Marathi manoos in their homes, the outlook [of Marmik] changed from providing entertainment to leading an attack against the injustice. Gradually, the movement led to the formation of an organisation that we now know by the name Shiv Sena,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/marathi-manoos-can-take-on-any-oppressor-maharashtra-cm-101628881495346.html

Officials were directed to identify 10 suitable locations where EV charging stations can be set up in partnership with a private firm. Ludhiana is among the 122 non-attainment cities in the country according to the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) norms. This means it has over a five-year period not consistently met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for harmful PM 10 (particulate matter that is 10 microns or less in diameter), PM 2.5 or NO2 (nitrogen dioxide).Stating that a survey for the locations will be started soon, MC additional commissioner Aaditya Dachalwal said, “Residents are increasingly switching to EVs, including e-bikes, rickshaws and cars, for which public EV charging stations are needed. After the suitable locations are identified, a private firm will be hired to set these up through revenue-sharing model.

A contractor reached the spot in the morning but was sent back after the owner, Tara Chand, insisted that he would get the remaining portion demolished himself.Slamming the civic body for the delay in action and raising concern over the remaining structure, the owners of adjoining buildings stated that it might also collapse, causing further damage to them.Three adjoining buildings, including the one with labour quarters, a transport shed, and a cycle parts godown were damaged after debris fell on them.Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) councillor Swarandeep Singh Chahal, owner of the adjoining transport shed, said, “The incident could have been averted if the MC had razed the building on August 5 instead of sealing it. The remaining part should be brought down at the earliest as it can also collapse at any time.” Meanwhile, MC assistant town planner (ATP) Mohan Singh said that the owner stressed upon getting the building demolished himself so, the MC got an affidavit from him stating that he will be responsible for any untoward incident that takes place during the process.Earlier during the day, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal marked an inquiry into the building collapse and removal of the seal by the owner. Meanwhile, in the FIR registered against the building owner, the names of his sons, Amit Singal and Deepak Singal, have also been added.Two still under treatmentA total of six out of seven injured persons admitted to the Mohan Dai Oswal Cancer Hospital, were discharged on Thursday evening, while Arush, a two-year-old, was still undergoing treatment. His mother Pooja, 28, was readmitted after her condition deteriorated.Shopkeepers highlight other unsafe buildingsShopkeepers of Shaheed Kartar Singh Sarabha Market, Gill Road, on Friday sought action against unsafe buildings in other parts of the city, especially the decades-old government buildings near MC’s Zone-C office.Despite identifying 132 unsafe buildings in the city in a recent survey, MC has failed to take action. Instead, the civic body has been writing to the police to get them vacated stating that it doesn’t have authority to do so under Municipal Corporation Act, 1976.The shopkeepers rued that a small portion of an unsafe government building had collapsed on July 6 and the civic body should take corrective steps to avoid any more untoward incidents.Jatinderpal Singh Saluja, president of the market association, said, “Three government buildings near the MC’s Zone-C office can collapse any time. They were established around 40 years ago. Fortunately, the small portion of one of these buildings collapsed at night on July 6, otherwise someone may have got injured.”MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said they will again conduct a survey of unsafe buildings in the city and take action against those on the verge of collapse. “Building branch officials also visited the unsafe buildings at Gill Road on Friday and corrective steps are being taken,” he added.“The owners and tenants in most of the buildings are at loggerheads over the possession and court cases regarding the same are sub-judice, due to which no action can be taken by MC,” the commissioner said.Homes damaged, over 400 labourers left shelterlessOver 400 labourers were rendered homeless as the municipal corporation (MC) got their quarters vacated to begin the demolition process of the unsafe building.The debris of the collapsed building had fallen on and damaged the labour quarters.The labourers spent Thursday night at a dharamshala and shifted to the MC’s night shelter in the area on Friday. They stated that they cannot return to their quarters until the unsafe building is demolished even though all their belongings are there. Many of them said that they could not even leave for their jobs on Friday as confusion prevailed over the availability of food and arrangement for temporary accommodation for their families. The labourers rued that the MC should demolish the unsafe building at the earliest so they can get back to their normal life.A labourer Shiv Nath said, “We do not even have our clothes, and the owner of the quarters is arranging food for us as of now. Many of us could not go to work as we might also have to look for some other accommodation. The administration should help us as it is becoming difficult for us to make ends meet. We are daily wagers and cannot survive without going to work.”The MC officials stated that they cannot allow the labourers to go back to their quarters until the adjoining unsafe building is demolished, as the remaining structure can collapse at any time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/factory-collapse-in-ludhiana-finally-building-owner-starts-demolition-101628880898018.html
14-08-2021||Mumbai||Why additional rules when IT Act has sufficient checks: Bombay HC asks Centre||The Bombay high court (HC) has reserved its order in the public interest litigations (PIL) seeking interim reliefs against the operation of the Information Technology (Guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, announced by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) in February and implemented in May. While hearing the concluding arguments, the court sought to know from the Centre the need for additional rules while the provisions in the existing IT Act (2009) sufficed to make publications, portals and intermediaries answerable for posting any content that is objectionable and liable for penal action. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing two PILs filed by digital news portal The Leaflet and senior journalist Nikhil Wagle, was informed that by prescribing code of ethics under the new rules, the government was trying to supersede substantive legislation by way of delegated legislation. The bench was further informed that the Press Council and Cable Acts already had code of ethics that were being adhered to by the print and electronic media. Hence, bringing in additional rules would have a “chilling effect” on editors and authors. The bench was also informed that the objection was to rules 9, 14 and 16, which dealt with code of ethics, formation of an inter-departmental committee at the ministry level and blocking of information in the event of an emergency. Thereupon, the bench remarked that it was inclined to grant limited interim relief to the petitioners with regards to rule 9. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the Centre, however, urged the court to not pass such orders as the petitioners’ fears of adverse action on the breach of the new rules were unfounded. He stated that there were three layers of answerability of the publishers, first through self-regulation and second through regulation by a body of the publishers, and only then would the matter be taken up by the committee of the ministry. He added that the committee was not yet notified but was in the process of being formed. The court, however, pointed out that while the committee formation yet underway, the publishers would have to deal with the fear of having a sword hanging on their heads. Advocate Darius Khambata for The Leaflet pointed to the fact that a journalist is at the threat of being held responsible for any inaccuracy in the event of writing or printing something without getting both sides. This, he said, would restrain one from writing anything at all, which is against the right to freedom of speech. He added that while section 69A of the IT Act dealt with blocking of content, in the event of its failure, the government was trying to have a second set of rules to achieve its purpose. Advocate Abhay Nevagi for Wagle informed the bench that the intermediaries had been protected against penal action by section 79 of the IT Act. However, the new rules took away that protection in case of non-compliance. He added that as the scope of the definition of intermediary was very wide, his client was also an intermediary. However, when the court questioned how Wagle could be considered an intermediary, Nevagi said the definition needed interpretation. When the court sought to know how the new rules could take away the protection granted by a law, Singh informed that it was a question of merit and as the court was only dealing with interim relief, the question would be answered at a later stage. He added that the rules were brought in to check the spread of fake news and illegal content only. The court will pass its order on Saturday at 5.30pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/why-additional-rules-when-it-act-has-sufficient-checks-bombay-hc-asks-centre-101628880475483.html
14-08-2021||Mumbai||MSCBC considering 102 applications for inclusion in OBC category||What is common between diverse social groups like Mappilas from Kerala who are settled in Maharashtra, Lingayat Rangaris, Brahmins, Chunawalas, Kadava Patels and Halwais? They are all seeking inclusion in the other backward classes (OBC) category. The Maharashtra State Commission for Backward Classes (MSCBC) is considering 102 applications from various castes and sub-castes, classes and communities for inclusion in the OBC category or for a change from one category of reservations to another. “These applications include those made by communities that have migrated from other states decades ago and from castes and sub-castes like that of the Maratha community,” said a member of the commission.Some of those who want to be classified as OBCs or Nomadic Tribes (NT) include Mullahs, Loni Marathas, Kshatriya Saini Marathas, Muslim Khelkari (Untawale), and Rana Rajputs. Curiously, some from the Brahmin community and Gujarati Brahmin community have also sought OBC status for quota benefits. Some OBC castes also want to be reshuffled into the Vimukta Jati (VJ) or NT categories for ring-fenced reservations.After receiving the applications, MSCBC scrutinises them and forms a sub-committee to verify the validity of the claim. This sub-committee conducts area surveys, field visits and holds discussions with members of the community. The demand is scrutinised based on indicators of social, educational and economic backwardness; and those scoring over 50% in these aspects can be classified as a backward class.“Maharashtra has some small castes and groups that are largely ignored. They realised the benefits of reservations quite late. A gradual growth in literacy and social awareness made them understand the need for inclusion in OBC category. It is their Constitutional right to stake a claim for this. MSCBC shall take a decision based on inferences drawn through field visits and surveys,” said Hari Narke, activist and former member of the commission.Narke said these claims included those for fresh inclusion in OBC category or a change from OBC category to sections like VJ which covers denotified tribes, and NT. Some groups that are part of the OBC, VJ and NT categories also want to be included in the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) category.C Shamshuddin, founder president of Pune Malyali Association who has sought inclusion of Mappila Muslims in OBC category in Maharashtra, said the community was part of OBC list in Kerala. “This will ensure quota benefits for those who have migrated from Kerala to Maharashtra… Even today, social and educational backwardness persist among this community,” he said, adding that in Maharashtra, Mappila Muslims were engaged in businesses like running small restaurants and shops, and plying vehicles.Shabbir Ansari, president of All India Muslim OBC Organisation, supported the inclusion of groups like Chunawalas and Halwais in the category. “Chunawalas do not have substantial numbers but are spread across Maharashtra. Earlier, they functioned as lime burners who manufactured lime used for white-washing houses. The advent of modern methods of painting has affected their trade,” explained Ansari. He added that similarly, Halwais, who were traditional sweetmeat manufacturers dispersed across the state, deserved inclusion in OBC category on the basis of social and educational backwardness.Surprisingly, MSCBC has also been petitioned seeking that Brahmins and Gujarati Brahmins be classified as OBCs. However, community leaders like Anil Gachke of Akhil Bharatiya Brahman Mahasangh and Moreshwar Ghaisas ‘Guruji’ of Bahubhashak Brahman Nyas have questioned this demand. Gachke said they were seeking that instead of quotas, the economically weaker section of the community get aid from the government.An OBC activist noted that reservation is not a poverty alleviation programme, but was meant to correct historic wrongs and help deprived groups overcome their social and educational backwardness.PG Jogdand, former head of the department of sociology, University of Mumbai, said this was the reversal of the Sankritisation theory formulated by sociologist MN Srinivas which said that castes lower in the hierarchy seek to emulate the upper castes for social mobility. Now, many castes, including dominant castes, seem to feel that development can be attained only by reservations, and claimed to have regressed in the social order for these benefits.Jogdand said while most castes and sub-castes were seeking reservations, there were demands for reservations within reservations, like Matang community which wants a separate quota in the scheduled castes (SC). This was because of a sentiment that some entrenched groups had cornered most benefits within a quota.When contacted, DD Deshmukh, member secretary of MSCBC, confirmed that the commission was considering these 102 cases, but refused to comment further.BOX:How a group is included in OBC Category There is a 25-mark formula to classify a community as backward. This includes social (12 marks), educational (8 marks) and economic (5 marks). Those groups getting over 50% marks can be classified as OBCs.These cover social indicators such as social practices and attitudes, age of marriage, religious traditions, whether widow remarriage is allowed; economic status such as average income, housing pattern and type of houses, land holding; educational indicators like literacy rate, women’s literacy, drop-out rate, presence in higher education and professional courses and in jobs.MSCBC’s Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC) covering all households across the state will generate empirical data on the backwardness of individual communities and enable scientific decision-making.The 127th Constitution Amendment Bill approved by Parliament, has restored the rights of states to make their own OBC lists.OBCs form around 53% of Maharashtra’s population — 43.70% Hindus and 8.40% non-Hindus. They are divided in the category with around 350 Hindu and non-Hindu classes (19% reservation) and Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribes (VJ&NT) which covers about 50 groups (11% quota).Some quota claims:Fresh inclusion in OBC or VJNT category:Suryavanshi Kshatriya, Kasodhan, Mappila Muslims, Mullahs, Loni Marathas, Halwais, Lingayat Rangari, Chunewale/ Chungar/ Chunawalas, Kadava Patidars, Kshatriya Saini Marathas, Brahmins, Gujarati Brahmins, Muslim Khelkari (Untawale), Valanju/ Valanju Vani and Rana RajputsChange in category:Hanbar (OBC to NT)Halba Koshti (SBC to OBC)Bhaat (OBC to VJ)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mscbc-considering-102-applications-for-inclusion-in-obc-category-101628880415421.html

The minister has been asked to appear on October 12, with Punjab Small Industries and Export Corporation (PSIEC) director and chief general manager SP Singh.The commission has acted on a complaint from former deputy speaker of Punjab assembly, Bir Devinder Singh. Bir Devinder has alleged a scam in sale of 32 acre of land in Mohali. “Under pressure of the industries minister Sunder Sham Arora, the PSIEC made attempts to issue a no-objection certificate (NOC) without the sanction of the finance department and the advise of the advocate general’s office,” the complaint alleges, adding that advice was taken only from private lawyers.When opposition political parties raised a hue and cry, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh referred the matter to the finance department and the AG; their reports confirmed that this sale of land caused the state exchequer a loss of ₹125 crore. The complaint adds that all this was done in March 2020, when no official activity and movement was allowed due to the curfew in place in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jct-electronics-land-deal-lokpal-summons-punjab-industries-minister-arora-psiec-director-on-oct-12-101628880295289.html

14-08-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt hopes governor will appoint 12 MLCs||After the Bombay high court’s remark on Friday that governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari was constitutionally obligated to either accept or reject within reasonable time the proposal sent by the state government to appoint 12 members of legislative Council, ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leaders said they are hopeful that the governor will now make the appointments. The governor nominates 12 people as members of the legislative council (MLCs) for a tenure of six years. The appointments are made by the governor based on the state cabinet’s recommendation. Most of the seats have been vacant since June last year. The state had approved the names in November 2020, but they are yet to be cleared by the governor. The list submitted to the governor included the names of Vijay Karanjkar, Urmila Matondkar, Nitin Bangude-Patil and Chandrakant Raghuvanshi from the Shiv Sena; Eknath Khadse, Raju Shetti, Yashpal Bhinge and Anand Shinde from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP); and Rajni Patil, Sachin Sawant, Anniruddha Vankar and Muzaffar Hussain from the Congress. The inaction by the governor was challenged before the Bombay high court. While disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL), the high court observed that it cannot give directions to the governor, but hoped that things would be set right at an early date. “Whatever be the reason, it is time that the impasse is resolved…Eight months seems to be beyond reasonable time,” said a division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish S Kulkarni. The court also said the governor should speak with chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray) and let him know about his reservations in the list of nominees, if any, within reasonable time, or else, the “statutory intent will stand defeated”. There was no reaction from Raj Bhavan till late on Friday. Senior Congress minister Balasaheb Thorat said, “There is a limit on how much time the governor can keep a file pending with him. By delaying the approval, he is denying people their right. The delay is because of politics.” Senior NCP minister Nawab Malik said although the governor is not bound to take a decision in a time-bound manner, the law clearly says it is the right of the state government. “Once a proposal is cleared by the state cabinet, it is mandatory for the governor to approve. As the governor cannot reject it, he is keeping it pending, which is unfair. While saying that the HC cannot give directions to him, it also said that in the interest of the state the decision should be taken at the earliest,” Malik said. Leader of opposition in the legislative council Pravin Darekar tried to support the governor. He said that by refusing to give directions to the governor, the high court has supported the stand taken by the governor, which indicated that the allegations made by the ruling parties against him are baseless. “The governor is aware of his powers. The court has not directed him to take a decision in a certain period. He (governor) will decide when to make the appointment. The ruling parties should not try to pressure him through repeated criticism,” Darekar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-hopes-governor-will-appoint-12-mlcs-101628880175279.html

14-08-2021||Delhi||SC accepts banks’ demands, paves way for funding of stalled Amrapali projects||In a major relief to more than 40,000 homebuyers of Amrapali Group, the Supreme Court on Friday cleared the hurdles in the way of banks willing to fund stalled projects by agreeing to three of their demands set as conditions for processing the funding proposals.The court was also informed that the first tranche of the ₹650 crore funding from the Union government-sponsored SWAMIH (Special Window for Affordable & Mid-Income Housing) Investment Fund will be made available for six Amrapali projects in the coming weeks.The court-appointed receiver senior advocate R Venkataramani, who has been interacting with banks and the government as part of efforts to revive stalled housing projects, informed a bench of justices UU Lalit and Ajay Rastogi that the SWAMIH Investment Fund had delivered the token amount of ₹10 crore to NBCC India Limited for the construction of six Amrapali housing projects. “In a fortnight, a huge quantum of ₹650 crore will come,” Venkataramani informed the judges.The ₹650 crore will benefit nearly 7,000 housing units in six Amrapali projects — Silicon City-1, Silicon City-2, Crystal Homes, Centurion Park-Low Rise, O2 Valley and Tropical Garden. Of the 6,947 units in these projects, about 6,132 units have been sold till date. The NBCC took over construction contracts of 23 Amrapali projects after the Supreme Court in July 2019 cancelled registration of Amrapali under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, for diverting money received from homebuyers and failing to deliver flats even five years past the promised deadline.The receiver further informed the Supreme Court that public banks have come a long way forward to fund Amrapali projects but needed an order from court to address their concerns.During the previous hearing in the matter, the banks raised concerns of sufficient security against the credit provided. The court then assured the banks that the “word of the Supreme Court was sufficient assurance” for the banks to proceed.On August 9, the Receiver met officials from 10 banks — State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, Union Bank of India, UCO Bank, Bank of India, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Canara Bank, and Bank of Maharashtra — and crystallised their concerns in a note filed before the court.The bench agreed to three suggestions made by banks. These included funds to Amrapali projects to be categorised under priority funding sector with a reduced capital charge; status of funds given to these projects through Amrapali Stressed Projects Investments Reconstruction Establishment (ASPIRE) to remain standard in case of default or delay in repayment (without being declared non-performing asset); and, no further external valuation of Amrapali assets on the economic viability of the projects.Three banks – UCO Bank, Bank of Baroda and Bank of India – informed the court that talks are on to form a consortium for moving a funding proposal. with the court accepting the three conditions, counsels appearing for other banks — Axis Bank and PNB— assured the judges that their concerns stood addressed.The bench in its order said, “Banks shall now proceed to expedite the process of extending financial provision to Amrapali projects.”Venkataramani said with this, it will be easier to get banks on board. He further informed the court that owners of 15,748 units across Amrapali projects have not been paying their instalments. Of them, 9,538 flat buyers have not provided the customer data, a record of which is maintained by the receiver’s office.The bench gave a final opportunity of two weeks to the 9,538 homebuyers to register their details with the receiver, failing which, the apartments/villas booked by them will be included as part of the unsold inventory and will be put up for sale.The NBCC apprised the court of a fund crunch that was affecting one of the projects, Amrapali Zodiac; the residents’ welfare association was not letting the construction work to go on. Advocate ML Lahoty appearing for the homebuyers informed the court that he did not represent the homebuyers of the said project.Last month, Lahoty had complained that despite monitoring by the court, funds were not forthcoming. In a note filed by him, he stated that the construction of 46,459 Amrapali units, an amount of ₹8,016.88 crore is required. The assurance by SWAMIH Fund to provide ₹650 crore was recorded by the court on September 1, 2020, but nothing was forthcoming till date. Even on recoveries to be made by attaching Amrapali assets, only ₹7.64 crore has been achieved till date, Lahoty added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sc-accepts-banks-demands-paves-way-for-funding-of-stalled-amrapali-projects-101628879454715.html

14-08-2021||Delhi||Plan to enforce single-use plastic ban in works, says pollution control panel||The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on Friday said they have already drafted a plan to enforce the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021, which aims to phase out single-use plastic in the country, and said it is pending approval with the state environment department.The DPCC said they are also in talks with industries, market associations and resident welfare associations to create awareness and to ensure that the ban is effectively implemented.“We have prepared our action plan to follow the directions that have been notified. It should be approved by next week,” said a DPCC official on Friday.According to the notification of the plastic waste management rules, the permitted thickness of the plastic bags will be increased from the current 50 microns to 75 microns from September 30 this year, and further to 120 microns from December 31, 2022.Further, all plastic products, including ear buds with plastic sticks, plastic flags, candy sticks, ice-cream sticks, polystyrene (thermocol) for decoration; plates, cups, glasses, cutlery such as forks, spoons, knives, straw, trays, wrapping or packing films around sweet boxes, invitation cards, and cigarette packets, plastic or PVC banners of less than 100 micron thickness, will be banned from July 1, 2022.In Delhi’s own draft action plan, which is pending approval, the state pollution control board has detailed short, medium and long-term measures to phase out plastic use.The plan includes identification of littering hot spots with respect to single-use plastic items and development of a strategy for their collection and further management; implementation of a plan to manage legacy plastic waste based on location by September 30 this year. It also details plans to develop setting up recycling facilities by December 31 next year.The plan also devises steps to control use of plastic at the local level too.In July this year, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) had banned single-use plastic with thickness less than 50 microns in south Delhi markets, citing environmental concerns. The focus of this was Greater Kailash, Yusuf Sarai, Green Park, Kailash Colony, Shahpur Jat and Chattarpur.Meanwhile, experts said the key is ensure effective enforcement of the ban.Atin Biswas, programme director (municipal solid waste), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said that nearly 18 states have already banned single use plastic. “The states have to ensure that there is proper implementation of the notification. There is also a jarring aspect about this notification that all of the 19-20 items that are listed in it are not something that big brands manufacture. This means that only the informal sector and small enterprises making these items will be impacted. There won’t be any effect on the big players,” Biswas said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/plan-to-enforce-single-use-plastic-ban-in-the-works-says-delhi-pollution-control-panel-101628879214668.html
14-08-2021||Delhi||Three accused of raising anti-Muslim slogans at Jantar Mantar denied bail||A Delhi court dismissed the bail plea of three persons accused of raising communal slogans at Jantar Mantar during a protest on August 8 and said they made scathing remarks which were “undemocratic” and “uncalled for” from the citizens of the country.Metropolitan magistrate Udbhav Kumar Jain dismissed the bail pleas of Preet Singh, Deepak Singh and Vinod Sharma and said a prima facie perusal of all material available on record, including the video footage of the incident, failed to find support in favour of the accused.A video of anti-Muslim sloganeering during a protest at Jantar Mantar was widely circulated on social media, following which the Delhi Police registered a case in connection with the matter on Monday. Hundreds of people had attended the protest organised by “Bharat Jodo Aandolan” at Jantar Mantar on Sunday.Jain said, “In one of the clippings, applicant/accused, as identified by the IO (investigating officer) in the video clipping, can be seen with the other accused Deepak Singh, who in one of the video clippings has made scathing remarks which are undemocratic and uncalled for from a citizen of this country where principles like secularism hold the value of a basic feature imbibed in the Constitution.” “Freedom to express oneself is indeed allowed to be enjoyed by citizens to the fullest possible extent, yet with every right there is a corresponding duty attached. The principle behind Section 153A (IPC) is to preserve religious/communal harmony and it is the duty of every citizen that while he enjoys his right to express himself, he preserves religious harmony. This indeed is the positive aspect of secularism,” he further said in the order of August 12.The IO submitted that the release of the accused would be prejudicial in maintaining public tranquillity and would create a further law and order situation.The public prosecutor claimed that the gathering was held without permission near the Parliament during the ongoing monsoon session and the accused persons violated Covid-19 protocols.The court said, “Considering the fact that investigation of the present case is at a nascent stage, the nature of accusations levelled against the accused persons and also taking into account the overall facts and circumstances of the case, this court is not inclined to allow the present application at this stage.” Earlier on August 11, the court granted bail to Supreme Court lawyer and former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, noting that he was neither seen in the video nor were the slogans were raised at his behest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/three-accused-of-raising-anti-muslim-slogans-at-delhi-s-jantar-mantar-denied-bail-101628879156211.html

Vaccination shall be done through CoWin portal in walk-in mode. Training of vaccinators for conduct of these sessions on CoWin must be ensured,” it further said.“Based on Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights’ recommendations, the Delhi government’s health department has issued orders allowing lactating mothers to get themselves vaccinated for Covid-19 (on the same day) at the centres meant for children’s routine immunisation. They no longer need to make separate visits now,” said Anurag Kundu, chairperson of the commission, in a tweet.The central government approved Covid-19 vaccination for lactating women on May 19 and pregnant women from June 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhipregnant-lactating-women-to-get-covid-vaccine-at-check-up-facilities-101628878914619.html
14-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Rainfall deficit of 54% in August so far||After experiencing above average rains in July, Delhi has fallen back to recording a rainfall deficit of nearly 54% in the first half of August, India Meteorological Department (IMD) recordings showed. Met officials and private weather forecasters, however, said that despite a dry start to the month, August is likely to cover its rainfall deficit in the last 10 days and it is likely to be a “near normal” monsoon month.IMD recordings show that this July, the rainfall at 507.1 mm was more than twice the average of 210.6 mm for the month. As August began, the showers relented.Till August 13, the Safdarjung weather station recorded 63.2 mm rains, close to half the 116.1 mm which is the normal for the month.Analysis further showed that south Delhi is standing at a 49% rainfall deficit, southwest Delhi is at a 46% deficit and New Delhi recorded a 33% rainfall deficit. Northwest Delhi saw a 20% rainfall deficit, west Delhi saw an 80% deficit and northeast Delhi recorded an 80% rainfall deficit. While this is partly because of the ‘break monsoon’ phase that the northwest and central India are experiencing currently, weather experts said that even before the Capital went into the break phase, it only recorded three rainy days. Even in these three days, the city recorded only light to moderate showers.According to weather experts, break monsoon is a phase typical of the southwest monsoon. This pause could last a couple of days or even a fortnight. Break monsoon is categorised by the trough shifting northwards and closer to the foothills of the Himalayas.While rainfall decreases in parts of north, northwest and central India, this weather phenomenon results in an increase in showers along the Himalayan foothills, in northeast India and also along the southern peninsula.Delhi and neighbouring states entered a break monsoon phase on August 9 and according to initial forecast this pause was likely to continue till August 16. However, in a recent forecast, the Met officials said that Delhi is likely to come out of this break phase only after August 19.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said, “There are no chances of rains till August 19. Revival of monsoon with only light rain is expected around August 19 and August 20.”While half the month has already gone in a dry spell, forecasters are still hopeful that August is likely to cover its deficit. “The monsoon trough is expected to shift southwards after August 15, but that will result in rainfall around Punjab and Haryana. While there could be patchy rains in Delhi, but it will take a few more days for rains to be more consistent in this region. However, the forecast says that after August 19, rains will become intense and we can get a near normal monsoon month,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather Services, a private weather forecasting agency.Weather officials also stressed that this was another example of erratic weather patterns Delhi has been recording over the last few years. This year, such extreme weather events were particularly jarring and this could be the larger impact of climate change, experts said.“It is true that the rainfall patterns are changing in the entire country. Delhi some 10 years back used to get an average of 15-20 rainy days, but now we are observing that the number of rainy days have reduced to only around eight to ten. This means that the rain spells are shorter and more intense. It is only natural that if the same amount of rain is received in a matter of a week as opposed to being uniformly distributed through the month, it will lead to incidents of flooding,” said a senior Met official, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rainfall-deficit-of-54-in-august-so-far-delhi-is-likely-to-make-up-for-dry-spell-in-last-10-days-met-101628878855227.html
14-08-2021||Delhi||HC asks authorities to enforce no-squatting policy in Nehru Place market||Appalled by the lack of cleanliness and presence of encroachment in the Nehru Place area that hampered the efforts of firefighters on Thursday to douse a blaze, the Delhi high court on Friday asked the authorities to hold a joint meeting to remove the vendors under the no-squatting policy.Taking suo motu cognizance, a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh asked the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the city police to file a status report on the matter, noting that the paved area is full of vendors which restricted the movement of the fire tenders.It directed that regular drives be conducted in the Nehru Place area by the SDMC and the Delhi police, along with the assistance of the local SHO, so that the vendors, once removed, do not return.A fire had broken out inside the showroom on the first floor of a multi-storey building in southeast Delhi’s Nehru Place on Thursday, following which six fire tenders were rushed to the spot. There were no casualties in the fire which reportedly started due to a short circuit in an electric board.Taking note of a video of the fire, the court observed that the fire engine struggled a lot to reach the spot due to the presence of hawkers. “The paved area is full of vendors which have restricted the movement of the fire tenders where the fire had broken out. The lack of cleanliness and maintenance on the part of the municipal bodies is apparent,” the bench noted in its order.Appearing for the city police, advocate Sanjay Lao, standing counsel (criminal) of the Delhi government, told the court that many vendors are covered by stay orders of the court, allowing them to squat in the area.Taking note of this submission, the court asked the authorities to sit together and solve the issue, while also asking them to file status reports on the no-hawking and no-vending policies, and the steps that can be taken to stop illegal occupation on the roads.DDA counsel Arjun Pant said that the area is under MCD and the agency would look into the matter. Advocate Divya Prakash Pande, appearing for SDMC, told the court that the PWD is carrying out construction work in the area and hence should be impleaded as party.“I have personally seen the construction and the demolition being carried on the main road, say for instance the flyover... the agencies pick up the dump and throw it behind in an area which is not visible by the eyes,” he claimed.However, this did not go down well with the court which remarked, “Let’s restrict ourselves only to the Nehru Place area. It seems that you are now covering up your wrongdoings.”The bench issued notice to the conditions of the roads and also issued notice to the Public Works Department (PWD) of the Delhi government, asking them to clarify their role in the construction work at the Nehru place area.The court has set August 24 as the next date of hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hcasks-authorities-to-enforce-no-squatting-policy-in-nehru-place-market-101628878735660.html

In June, the DDA initiated an online process to dispose of all the offline cases -- ones submitted manually -- in a time bound manner.“There is no pendency on part of the DDA in the housing department regarding cases (mostly related to conversion of property from leasehold to freehold) prior to June 1,2021,” said DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain.Explaining the 882 cases remaining with the body, Jain said, “These are cases where action is awaited on the part of applicants. Either their payments are due or some documents need to be submitted. The name and other details of these applicants have been uploaded on DDA’s website. The applicants may access the deficiency letter online.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/online-shift-streamlined-property-conversion-no-case-pendencydda-101628878434610.html

However, due to the ongoing pandemic, the celebration in schools across the city will be limited to virtual platforms.Different schools from the city noted that only a limited staff will be present in school on August 15 for the flag hoisting ceremony.Neelam Chakrabarty, principal, Delhi Public School, said that the school conducted a week-long celebration ahead of August 15.“On Friday, teachers had dressed up as freedom fighters and shared the contribution of these freedom fighters with the students. On August 15, there will be flag hoisting at the school followed by a cultural programme. This programme will be telecast ‘live’ on the school’s YouTube channel for students,” said Chakrabarty.Jayshree Venkatraman, principal at SNBP International School, Rahatani, said that the school planned a week-long celebration with various activities for the students.“As a corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative we had an arrangement with the Lion’s Club. We had collected participation fees from students. The total amount which was collected was then sent to the Lion’s Club. As an Independence Day initiative, this amount will be used to help those in need during this pandemic. We have collected around ₹60,000 from students,” said Venkatraman.Kavita Sahay Kerawalla, vice-chairperson, Vibgyor Group of Schools, said that the school will be running a platinum informative series.“This series will acknowledge 75 of Vibgyor’s academic and non-academic achievers on the social media pages of the schools. As we celebrate our Independence Day, it is indeed the dawn of a new era in education with the eagerly awaited implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP),” said Kerawalla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-schools-set-for-virtual-i-day-celebration-101628872194136.html
14-08-2021||Pune||Lockdown not necessary, prevents herd immunity: Cyrus Poonawalla||Responding to whether lockdown was necessary, Poonawalla said that he believes that the lockdown was not necessary as it would stop herd immunity from developing. He also criticised the Modi government for banning export of vaccines, as many countries ready to pay are not able to get it. He also praised the Modi government for speeding up the process to get approval for the vaccine licensing. Poonawallla also said that it is not possible that 75% of the country would be vaccinated by year end. He said, “Politicians are lying. We are yet to increase our production to 10 crore vaccines. No single company in the world can produce 10 crore vaccines in a month. We have promised about 110-120 crore doses annually because we invested in it prior. So you can do the math now. If other manufacturers produce 1-2 crores every month then the production would increase accordingly.” He said, “I don’t agree that there should be a lockdown because if there is a lockdown there would be no herd immunity. If there is no lockdown there we will be bound to see the disease in the beginning, but later people will get herd immunity. Why do I prefer lockdown over herd immunity? It’s because the number of deaths will be low. If many people are dying then lockdown could be essential. About 50-60% of the people who have died have lost their lives due to negligence, like not being able to reach the hospital on time, no money for treatment, vaccine hesitancy and treatment hesitancy, reaching in the hospital late when the symptoms have worsened. If there is immediate treatment, then the number of deaths would be much lower.” He further added, “Until the virus is eliminated from across the world, we might need to continue to take the vaccines after regular intervals. As of now people fear a third wave, however, in my opinion the third wave would not be so severe because of the herd immunity, and also vaccinated people who would have some immunity. We do not have so much experience to ignore the danger of this disease as of now. We are seeing one wave after another. For example in America, despite the high rate of vaccination, the situation is dire. I am not saying this because I want to make money by selling vaccines, but people should really get the vaccine or else they might regret it. He also said that the family had to bear huge cuts in profit as the vaccine costs less than what a cup of tea would cost in a five star restaurant. He said, “A measles vaccine which we give to the Government of India costs ₹10 a dose, while UNICEF and other countries are giving ₹50 a dose. These are the sacrifices that the Poonawalla family is making. Earlier, we used to produce a total of 15 crore vaccines every month. Now we are producing 15 crore doses of this one product monthly so that everyone gets the vaccine. We have prioritised Covid vaccine production over all other vaccines.” Speaking about the threats that the family was said to have received earlier, he said that it was blown out of proportion. “There was no threat as such and no reason for people to exaggerate that my son had to leave the country because of the threats. It was his annual summer vacation. It was completely blown out of proportion.” Praising the Modi government he said, “He has instructed the drug controller officials to ensure speedy licensing and approvals and not to sit on the files for a month or two.. Earlier, when we had to launch a pneumonia vaccine but we could not get approvals for over two years. They gave reasons like no challan, no document or would reply after a month. However, this time the process is much smoother. Although this applies only for the drug controller department I cannot speak for other government departments.”He said, “My son would not want me to say this but the Modi government should not ban us from exporting. Exports must be opened because the other 170 countries who took our vaccines all these years and now not able to get it. The Bill Gates foundation has given us ₹5,000 crore, but we are not yet able to give them the vaccine. We even offered to return the money, but they said they are ready to wait and get the vaccine when exports would open up.” “Centre is not approving extra doses for Pune”In view of a shortage of Covishield vaccines for Pune, Poonawalla said, “We had written to the Modi government to release more vaccines for Pune since there are more cases in Pune and also our company is in Pune, However, they have not even replied to our letter. They said that they would do what they want.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/lockdown-not-necessary-prevents-herd-immunity-cyrus-poonawalla-101628871414116.html
14-08-2021||Pune||Once parent company gets clearance from US FDA, we’ll get approval for Covavax: Cyrus Poonawalla||On Friday, Cyrus Poonawalla, founder of Serum institute of India (SII), which is mass producing Covishield, the anti-Covid19 vaccine, said that Covavax would be sent for approval once its parent company in the US gets approval for the same. Covavax is a vaccine developed specially for children, but has faced hurdles at the US FDA, said Poonawalla. Novavax which is developed by a US pharmaceutical company with the same name will be mass manufactured by SII. The current approved vaccines are only approved for adults making children a susceptible population.Poonawalla said, “Novavax is a very good product, however, unless we get the licence to launch it we cannot do so. The American parent company has got some issues with the US FDA which should be cleared by the end of year. Once they get the licence, we will get the licence. We will also try to get it approved before the parent company if possible.” Novavax is yet to be tried for phase 2/3 trials and efficacy for children aged 12-18 years.Poonawalla said, “Novavax can be given to the age group of 12 years and above and the trial is underway . However, Covishield was found to not be safe for kids aged under 18 and if something happens due to this then who would bear the responsibility? Not me. Regarding reopening of schools and colleges, we will need to see the effect as they start opening each class and then we can go ahead. If students do not go to school for a year or two it is fine, they can study at home. I never went to college and today, I am the founder of Serum Institute.”“As schools reopen,” he said, “it would be wise to wait and see how it impacts children and then we can take a call.” Poonawalla also said that lockdown is not a good option because it will not lead to herd immunity. “Those who have lost lives in this pandemic lost it because of lack of treatment, vaccine hesitancy or delay in reaching the hospital,” he said.Poonawalla also said that he is against mixing vaccines. He said, “It is too risky to mix two different vaccines and as a manufacturer I would not take the responsibility in case anyone develops any reactions or side effects due to the mixing. Also if one vaccine type is working then why mix?”Poonawalla also said that a gap of two months is ideal between two doses of Covishield, however, the current gap of three months, or the earlier gap of just one month, both were wrong. He said, “Two months’ gap is ideal. Also it is true that the number of antibodies would decrease after six months, however, memory cells in the body are present. It is advised to get a third dose or a booster shot, six months after the second shot. Unless the virus is reduced nominally across the world we might need to take vaccines.”Poonawalla was speaking during an award ceremony, where was presented with the Lokmanya Tilak National Award 2021 for his contribution in fighting the pandemic||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/once-parent-company-gets-clearance-from-us-fda-we-ll-get-approval-for-covavax-cyrus-poonawalla-101628870934084.html

Likewise, the owner of our consulate premises in Herat received a call from the Taliban to come to the building with keys,” a source said.Also Read: Taliban set hard conditions for peace talks with Afghan govt82 districts in the country are now under the Afghanistan government, while 252 are under the control of the Taliban and the status of 92 are disputed. The Afghan government has claimed that in the last 24 hours, in which the Taliban have taken over the Angoor Adda border crossing between Paktika Province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan, 172 Taliban were killed and 107 wounded as a result of ANDSF operations in Nangarhar, Logar, Maidan Wardak, Kandahar and Balkh Provinces.The Taliban captured Asadabad, the provincial capital of Kunar; Sharan, the provincial capital of Paktika; and Gardez, the provincial capital of Paktia, taking the number of Provincial capitals under its control to 20 out of 34. Taliban also captured Sarawazah district of Paktika and Shigal district of Kunar Province. Besides, the Taliban set free the prisoners after taking over Central prisons in Gardez, Sharan and Maimanah (Farhan). The US Embassy in Kabul is now planning to reduce its strength to a bare minimum by August 17.On Saturday, President Ashraf Ghani addressed his countrymen and promised that the situation will not be allowed to escalate anymore as the Afghan leadership is in talks with world leaders to mobilise the army. An Afghan leaders' delegation would leave for Islamabad on August 15, which will include Yunus Qanooni, Mohammad Karim Khalili, Ustaad Mohaqiq, Ahmad Zia Masoud, Khalid Noor, Latif Pedram, Syed Mansoor Naderi (all non-Pashtuns), and Kalimullah Naqibi, a Pashtun but affiliated to the Jamiat-e-Islami.Another Afghan delegation under Abdullah Abdullah would visit Doha. Abdullah has an ‘important ‘ meeting in Kabul on Sunday and would, therefore, not leave for Doha tonight, as was earlier expected, sources said. Leaders of Afghan refugees in Iran on Saturday issued a joint statement urging the international community to prevent human catastrophe due to internal displacement and called for a session of the UNSC to address the issue. Separately, the Iranian culture ministry has asked its media to refrain from using terms such as “brutality” (vahsigari) for the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-lock-indian-consulates-for-security-in-kandahar-herat-sources-101628961008987.html
14-08-2021||World||Taliban capture Mazar-e-Sharif, 4th largest Afghan city||Mazar-e-Sharif, the fourth-largest city in Afghanistan, fell to the Taliban on Saturday after a multipronged assault launched by insurgents, according to a lawmaker.Balkh lawmaker Abas Ebrahimzada said the province’s national army corps surrendered first, which prompted the pro-government militias and other forces to lose morale and give up in the face of the onslaught.According to the lawmaker, all of the provincial installations, including the governor’s office, are in Taliban hands.The insurgents have captured much of northern, western and southern Afghanistan in a breakneck offensive less than three weeks before the U.S. is set to withdraw its last troops, raising fears of a full militant takeover or another Afghan civil war.The Taliban have made major advances in recent days, including capturing Herat and Kandahar, the country’s second- and third-largest cities. They now control about 20 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces, leaving the Western-backed government with a smattering of provinces in the center and east, as well as Kabul.On Saturday, the Taliban captured all of Logar province, just south of the capital, Kabul, and detained local officials, said Hoda Ahmadi, a lawmaker from the province. She said the Taliban have reached the Char Asyab district, just 11 kilometers (7 miles) south of Kabul.Insurgents also captured the capital of Paktika, bordering Pakistan, according to Khalid Asad, a lawmaker from the province. He said fighting broke out in Sharana early Saturday but ended after local elders intervened to negotiate a pullout. He said the governor and other officials surrendered and were on their way to Kabul.The Taliban also took control of Maimana, the capital of northern Faryab province, said Fawzia Raoufi, a lawmaker from the province. Maimana had been under siege for a month, and Taliban fighters entered the city days ago. Security forces finally surrendered Saturday, she said.Sayed Hussan Gerdezi, a lawmaker from the neighboring Paktia province, said the Taliban seized most of its local capital, Gardez, but that battles with government forces were still underway. The Taliban said they controlled the city.Afghan President Ashraf Ghani delivered a televised speech Saturday, his first public appearance since the recent Taliban gains. He vowed not to give up the “achievements” of the 20 years since the U.S. toppled the Taliban after the 9/11 attacks.The U.S. has continued holding peace talks between the government and the Taliban in Qatar this week, and the international community has warned that a Taliban government brought about by force would be shunned. But the insurgents appear to have little interest in making concessions as they rack up victories on the battlefield.“We have started consultations, inside the government with elders and political leaders, representatives of different levels of the community as well as our international allies," Ghani said. "Soon the results will be shared with you,” he added, without elaborating further.The president had flown to Mazar-e-Sharif on Wednesday to rally the city's defenses, meeting with several militia commanders, including Abdul Rashid Dostum and Ata Mohammad Noor, who command thousands of fighters.They remain allied with the government, but during previous rounds of fighting in Afghanistan, warlords have been known to switch sides for their own survival. Ismail Khan, a powerful former warlord who had tried to defend Herat, was captured by the Taliban when the insurgents seized the western city after two weeks of heavy fighting.Tens of thousands of Afghans have fled their homes, with many fearing a return to the Taliban’s oppressive rule. The group had previously governed Afghanistan under a harsh version of Islamic law in which women were forbidden to work or attend school, and could not leave their homes without a male relative accompanying them.Salima Mazari, one of the few female district governors in the country, said she has never even considered surrendering.“There will be no place for women,” said Mazari, who governs a district of 36,000 people near Mazar-e-Sharif. “In the provinces controlled by the Taliban, no women exist there anymore, not even in the cities. They are all imprisoned in their homes.”The withdrawal of foreign troops and the swift collapse of Afghanistan's own forces — despite hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S. aid over the years — has raised fears the Taliban could return to power or that the country could be shattered by factional fighting, as it was after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989. It's also prompted many American and Afghan veterans of the conflict to question whether two decades of blood and treasure was worth it.Afghans have been streaming into Kabul's international airport in recent days, desperate to fly out, even as more American troops have arrived to help partially evacuate the U.S. Embassy.The first Marines from a contingent of 3,000 arrived Friday. The rest are expected by Sunday, and their deployment has raised questions about whether the administration will meet its Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline.The U.S. Air Force has carried out several airstrikes to aid its Afghan allies on the ground but they appear to have done little to stem the Taliban's advance. A B-52 bomber and other warplanes traversed the country's airspace Saturday, flight-tracking data showed.The Taliban meanwhile released a video announcing the takeover of the main radio station in the southern city of Kandahar, which fell to the insurgents earlier this week, renaming it the Voice of Sharia, or Islamic law.In the video, an unnamed insurgent said all employees were present and would broadcast news, political analysis and recitations of the Quran, the Islamic holy book. It appears the station will no longer play music. It was not clear if the Taliban had purged the previous employees or allowed them to return to work.The U.S. invaded shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, which al-Qaida planned and carried out while being sheltered by Taliban. After rapidly ousting the Taliban, the U.S. shifted toward nation-building, hoping to create a modern Afghan state after decades of war and unrest.Earlier this year, President Joe Biden announced a timeline for the withdrawal of all U.S. troops by the end of August, pledging to end America's longest war. His predecessor, President Donald Trump, had reached an agreement with the Taliban to pave the way for a U.S. pullout.Biden's announcement set the latest offensive in motion. The Taliban, who have long controlled large parts of the Afghan countryside, moved quickly to seize provincial capitals, border crossings and other key infrastructure.“The security situation in the city is getting worse," said Kawa Basharat, a resident in Mazar-e-Sharif. "I want peace and stability; the fighting should be stopped.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-capture-mazar-e-sharif-4th-largest-afghan-city-101628962191945.html
14-08-2021||World||Putin urges stronger response to 'unprecedented' Siberian wildfires||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday urged authorities to strengthen their efforts to fight wildfires across northeastern Siberia, calling the situation “unprecedented” as fires threatened people's homes.Speaking in a video call with top officials, Putin noted that 13 forest fires in the Sakha-Yakutia region are raging within five kilometers (3 miles) of populated areas and emphasized the need to closely monitor the situation to protect residents.Yakutia is the largest of Russia's 85 regions, a vast territory bigger than Argentina. It has faced a spell of particularly devastating wildfires this year following months of hot, dry weather and record-breaking temperatures. Flames previously threatened a dozen of villages, and several were evacuated. The provincial capital of Yakutsk, several other cities and hundreds of villages have been blanketed in choking smoke from the blazes.Emergencies Minister Yevgeny Zinichev reported to Putin on Saturday that his ministry has deployd 5,000 personnel, 765 vehicles and 19 aircraft to combat the wildfires in Yakutia.He said the thick smoke from wildfires has grounded firefighting planes, adding that efforts were being taken to relocate them to another base where they could operate again starting Monday. For now, firefighters have to rely exclusively on helicopters to fight the flames, Zinichev said.On Saturday, officials reported 108 active forest fires burning across nearly 1.3 million hectares (3.2 million acres) in Yakutia. Authorities have expanded a state of emergency in Yakutia to help transfer in firefighting resources from other regions.In recent years, Russia has recorded high temperatures that many scientists regard as a result of climate change. The hot weather coupled with the neglect of fire safety rules has caused a growing number of wildfires that authorities say have consumed 15 million acres this year in Russia.Experts in Russia decry a 2007 decision to disband a federal aviation network tasked to spot and combat fires and turn over its assets to regional authorities. The much-criticized transfer led to the force’s rapid decline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-urges-stronger-response-to-unprecedented-siberian-wildfires-101628961677963.html
14-08-2021||World||New terrorism threat warning by US mentions efforts of Al Qaeda||The US department of homeland security on Friday issued a new terrorism threat advisory due to the “heightened threat environment” ahead of the 20th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks. The National Terrorism Advisory System (NTAS) said in its new bulletin the United States continues to face a “diverse and challenging” threat environment, adding that the 9/11 attacks and religious holidays could serve as a catalyst for acts of targeted violence.“Today’s NTAS Bulletin advises the public about the heightened threat landscape we face and how DHS is working with our partners, at every level of government and in the community, to combat domestic terrorism and targeted violence in all its forms," secretary of homeland security Alejandro N. Mayorkas said in a statement.The terrorism threat comes at a time when the US troops are finalising their withdrawal from Afghanistan, which they invaded in the aftermath of the September 11 terror attacks. The Taliban, which was ousted by the US-led forces in 2001, has regained control over the majority of districts in Afghanistan and is gradually encircling Kabul to take back the power from the internationally recognised government of President Ashraf Ghani.US defence officials are concerned that the terror group Al Qaeda, which was behind the 9/11 attacks, could rebuild and consolidate in Afghanistan under the Taliban rule, according to US media reports.“Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula recently released its first English-language copy of Inspire magazine in over four years, which demonstrates that foreign terrorist organizations continue efforts to inspire US-based individuals susceptible to violent extremist influences,” the advisory says.The United States is also wary of threats from domestic terrorists and racially motivated violent extremists and anti-government violent extremists, the Capitol riots being a grave ultimatum. The homeland security department warned that the extremists and terror groups are increasingly exploiting online forums to spread violent extremist narratives and promote violent activity.“Such threats are also exacerbated by impacts of the ongoing global pandemic, including grievances over public health safety measures and perceived government restrictions,” the advisory added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-terrorism-threat-warning-by-us-mentions-efforts-of-al-qaeda-101628957833318.html

He also held a coordination meeting with officials where he was briefed on the security situation in Kabul and the neighbouring provinces. Reports said the meeting was attended by US Chargé d’Affaires Ross Wilson and US forces commander and both vowed support to Afghan forces.The participants in the consultative meeting agreed with Ashraf Ghani's notion that the situation can't be allowed to turn towards further instability. An authoritative team for negotiations will be assigned, it has been decided. The responsibility of this team has not been specified, but reports said they will push plans of ceasefire and an interim setup.According to reports, the Taliban are camping just 50 kilometres away from Kabul and two more provinces were captured on Saturday. Logar which is just at south of Kabul was captured by Taliban insurgents and some reports said the Taliban have reached the Chae Asyab district which is just 11 kilometres south of Kabul. The Taliban offensive gained immense pace in the last three weeks as Taliban fighters captured key provincial capitals across the country.In the televised speech he said he was consulting politicians and international leaders and he will not let the gains the country has made in the past two decades be lost. "As your president, my focus is on preventing further instability, violence, and displacement of my people," Ghani said.Qatar, which has been hosting so-far inconclusive peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban, said it had urged the insurgents to ceasefire during a meeting with their representatives on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ashraf-ghani-consults-leaders-push-for-ceasefire-in-negotiation-with-taliban-101628957474575.html

And studies cited by CDC in support of this new recommendation showed 40-44% of hospitalised breakthrough cases - those contracting Covid-19 despite being fully vaccinated - were immunocompromised people.Walensky cited another study to say emerging data suggested immunocompromised people did not develop the same level of antibodies despite the two shots as those with fully functional immune systems. Additionally, the data indicated infected immunocompromised people also transmit the virus to household contacts.The third dose followed recommendation from CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and modification of emergency use authorisation by the Food and Drug Administration.There was no word on non-mRNA vaccines such as AstraZeneca’s two-shot vaccine, which retails in India as Covishield, and Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine.Israel began administering the third dose of mRNA vaccines in July to healthcare workers and people over 60. But they would be eligible for the third only 5 months after their primacy inoculation. From August 13, Israel also started offering the third dose to those above 50.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-administer-third-dose-of-covid-vaccine-to-immunocompromised-101628951582194.html

"Due to the conflict that we're seeing across the country, many people are arriving in Kabul and other large cities, trying to seek safety for themselves and for their families," said Stephane Dujarric, the chief spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The UN and its humanitarian partners have verified that a total of 10,350 internally displaced people arrived in Kabul between July 1 and August 12 as fighting rages on."We are not blind to the suffering of the civilians who are caught in the crossfire in urban environments,” Secretary General’s Personal Envoy on Afghanistan and Regional Issues Jean Arnault told reporters, adding that the UN is continuing to engage with the Taliban in Doha to bring about a “political solution” to the violence. “We are continuing to engage with the Taliban in Doha. We are continuing to believe that there is a political solution that can be had. This doesn’t mean that we are also blind to what is going on on the ground," Arnault said.Also Read: 'Won't allow imposed war on Afghans': President Ashraf Ghani's address amid Taliban offensiveThe UN has about 3,000 or so national staff and about 300 international staff engaged in humanitarian assistance programmes in war-torn Afghanistan, however the ongoing conflict and the resultant security challenges are proving difficult to overcome, Dujarric informed reporters. ”The United Nations stands ready to contribute to such a settlement and remains focused on providing assistance to the increasing number of Afghans in need,” he added.Dujarric expressed his alarm over the possibility of the Taliban taking over the capital city of Kabul and its impact on the population there. “It is clear that urban fighting in the city the size of Kabul would have a catastrophic impact on civilians, and we very much hope that this does not happen,” he told reporters on Thursday, adding that the UN is especially concerned “about the shift of fighting to urban areas, where the potential for civilian harm is even greater,”.The Taliban meanwhile continued to push closer to Kabul, capturing a town south of the capital that is one of the gateways to the city. The insurgent group also said they are close to capturing Maidan Shahr, another town close to Kabul on the main highway to the southern hub of Kandahar, a day after they took control of the second and third largest cities in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10350-internally-displaced-afghans-have-taken-shelter-in-capital-kabul-as-fight-101628945911389.html

That brought the total pandemic death toll to 97,208, and total confirmed cases to 4,389,085.Last week, Iran hit a record in both its single-day death toll and confirmed new cases of Covid-19, with 42,541 new coronavirus cases and a daily death toll of 588.Iran is struggling to vaccinate its people against the pandemic. Like much of the world, it remains far behind countries like the United States in vaccinations, with only 3.8 million of its more than 80 million people having received both vaccine doses.Many front-line medical workers have been vaccinated with Iran's locally produced shots, or the Chinese state-backed Sinopharm vaccine that may be less effective than other inoculations.Iran's government announced that its homemade vaccine provides 85% protection from the coronavirus, without disclosing data or details. Iran also imports Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, as well as the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot through the United Nations-backed COVAX program.So far, authorities have avoided imposing heavy-handed rules on a population badly equipped to bear them. Iran, which has suffered the worst virus outbreak in the region, is reeling from a series of crises: tough US sanctions, global isolation, a heat wave, the worst blackouts in recent memory and ongoing protests over water and electricity shortages.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, in January slammed shut any possibility of American or British vaccines entering the country, calling them “forbidden.”For now, the majority of Iranians receiving vaccines rely on foreign-made shots. A health ministry spokesman said that Iran could import Western vaccines “as long as they're not produced in the US or Britain.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-will-impose-6-day-general-lockdown-over-coronavirus-101628942653012.html
14-08-2021||World||'Pakistan is complicit': US Congressman calls for sanction as Taliban advance||Amid accusations against Pakistan of covertly assisting the Afghan Taliban, a US Congressman has urged President Joe Biden to impose sanctions on Islamabad unless they "change course." In a letter to Biden, House Representative Mike Waltz said that Pakistan's military strategy is dictating the Taliban."At the least, Pakistan is complicit with Taliban advance and is choosing not to coordinate with the ANSF. At worst, the Pakistani military and intelligence services may be directly aiding the Taliban offensive," Waltz said, urging the Biden administration to cut off all aid to Pakistan."Additionally, I ask that your administration also consider sanctioning Pakistan unless they change course and make greater efforts to prevent the Taliban from using their border region to regroup between firefights," he added.The Republican lawmaker raised concerns about the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, urging the US president to reverse course and provide military resources to assist the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). He opined that Taliban forces are exposed on the ground as they were in 2001 and US air support can blunt the offensive.“Air support will give the Government of Afghanistan and ANSF time to regroup and turn the tide of battle. They are doing the fighting and dying on the ground, but American air support will bolster their resolve and change the battlefield psychology,” Waltz said.He expressed bafflement at the recent statements made by theUS special envoy in Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad, author of the Doha agreement. Highlighting the reports of abuses against women, Waltz said that Khalilzad has provided the president with poor counsel and “his diplomatic strategy has failed spectacularly.”“Ambassador Khalilzad has convinced multiple administrations that the Taliban is interested in governing and peace. It is clear that the Taliban is only interested in brutality and power. In light of this catastrophe, Ambassador Khalilzad should resign immediately or be relieved from his position,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-is-complicit-us-congressman-calls-for-sanction-as-taliban-advances-101628938820794.html

According to a report by the Associated Press, a schoolteacher from Takhar province in northern Afghanistan said that after Taliban capture, women were not allowed to go out to the market without a male escort.Girls riding home in a motorised rickshaw in the Takhar province were stopped and lashed for wearing "revealing sandals", the report said quoting families who have left their homeland and now took refuge in Kabul -- on the sidewalk, in the park.Those who saw Taliban rule before 2001, for them these diktats bring a flashback of that harrowing time when women were not allowed to study and work. The Taliban also carried out public executions, chopped off the hands of thieves and stoned women accused of adultery.The Taliban now control more than two-thirds of the country, including Herat and Kandahar, the two of the largest cities of the country. According to reports, it is now just a matter of time that Kabul will also be captured by the Taliban, though Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Saturday said that he was remobilising the armed forces.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday said horrific reports of Taliban oppression on Afghan women and girls have emerged from areas that have already been seized. "I'm... deeply disturbed by early indications that the Taliban are imposing severe restrictions on human rights in the areas under their control, particularly targeting women and journalists," Guterres told reporters.Associated Press interviewed Zahra (name changed) who has been working from home but after the Taliban took over Herat, she is not being able to work and she does not know when she will be able to work again. She is apprehensive that she won't be able to play the guitar, her brother won't be able to play football. And the women community of the country, which even reached the parliament in the last 20 years, will again be pushed back to the wall.Zarmina Kakar, a women's rights activist in Kabul,was a year old when the Taliban entered Kabul for the first time in 1996. Her mother took her out to buy her ice cream and was whipped by a Taliban fighter for revealing her face for a couple of minutes. “Today again, I feel that if Taliban come to power, we will return back to the same dark days,” she said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-revealing-slipper-women-not-allowed-to-go-out-alone-talibani-diktat-101628937430499.html

"Therefore, I have started extensive consultations inside the government with the elders, political leaders, representatives of people, and international partners on achieving a reasonable and certain political solution in which the peace and stability of the people of Afghanistan are envisaged." AFP said quoting Ghani.The insurgent Taliban have captured much of northern, western, and southern Afghanistan at a breakneck pace, alarming the US, which now projects the fall of the final frontier of the Afghan government, Kabul, within 90 days.

She said the Taliban have reached the Char Asyab district, just 11 kilometers (7 miles) south of the capital, Kabul.The Taliban also attacked the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif from several directions, setting off heavy fighting on its outskirts, according to Munir Ahmad Farhad, a spokesman for the provincial governor. There was no immediate word on casualties.Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had flown to Mazar-e-Sharif on Wednesday to rally the city's defenses, meeting with several militia commanders, including Abdul Rashid Dostum and Ata Mohammad Noor, who command thousands of fighters.They remain allied with the government, but during previous rounds of fighting in Afghanistan, warlords have been known to switch sides for their own survival. Ismail Khan, a powerful former warlord who had tried to defend Herat, was captured by the Taliban when the insurgents seized the western city after two weeks of heavy fighting.Residents of Mazar-e-Sharif expressed fear about the security breakdown.“The situation is dangerous outside of the city and inside the city," Mohibullah Khan said, adding that many residents are also struggling economically.“The security situation in the city is getting worse," said Kawa Basharat. "I want peace and stability. The fighting should be stopped.”The Taliban have made major advances in recent days, including capturing Herat and Kandahar, the country's second and third-largest cities. They now control 18 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, leaving the Western-backed government in control of a smattering of provinces in the center and east, as well as Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif.The withdrawal of foreign forces and the swift retreat of Afghanistan's own troops — despite hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S. aid over the years — has raised fears the Taliban could return to power or the country could be shattered by factional fighting, as it was after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989.The first Marines from a contingent of 3,000 arrived on Friday to help partially evacuate the U.S. Embassy. The rest are set to arrive by Sunday, and their deployment has raised questions about whether the administration will meet its Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline.The Taliban meanwhile released a video announcing the takeover of the main radio station in the southern city of Kandahar, renaming it the Voice of Sharia, or Islamic law.In the video, an unnamed insurgent said all employees were present and would broadcast news, political analysis, and recitations of the Quran, the Islamic holy book. It appears the station will no longer play music.It was not clear if the Taliban had purged the previous employees or allowed them to return to work. Most residents of Kandahar sport the traditional dress favored by the Taliban. The man in the video congratulated the people of Kandahar on the Taliban's victory.The Taliban have used mobile radio stations over the years, but have not operated a station inside a major city since they ruled the country from 1996-2001. At that time, they also ran a station called Voice of Sharia out of Kandahar, the birthplace of the militant group. Music was banned.The U.S. invaded shortly after the 9/11 attacks, which al-Qaida planned and carried out while being sheltered by theTaliban.

14-08-2021||World||Independence Day 2021: Why Pakistan celebrates freedom a day before India||Pakistan is celebrating its 75th Independence Day on Saturday, a day before India, too, marks its 74th year of freedom. However, the Indian Independence Act, 1947, gave birth to two sovereign countries, India and Pakistan, on August 15 that year. Then, why is it that Pakistan observes its Independence Day on August 14, and not on August 15?Over the years, multiple theories have been floated to answer the said question. Some of those are as follows:(1.) Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of British India and the first Governor-General of the Dominion of India, transferred the power of governance of Pakistan to its founder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in Karachi on August 14, 1947. Though Mountbatten mentioned August 15 as the date on which India and Pakistan would become independent nations, Pakistan adopted August 14 as its Independence Day as the transfer of power took place on that date.(2.) In June 1948, at a cabinet meeting chaired by Liaquat Ali Khan, the first Prime Minister of Pakistan, it was proposed that the country celebrate its Independence Day before India. The proposal was taken to Jinnah for his approval and the date was advanced to August 14.(3.) Religion is also cited as one of the reasons. It is argued that the intervening night of August 14 and 15, 1947, coincided with the 27th day of Ramadan, which is regarded as an auspicious day of the holy month. Hence, August 14 was taken as the day of independence.(4.) Indian Standard Time (IST) being 30 minutes ahead of the Pakistan Standard Time (PST) is also cited as a reason. Since India became a free country at 00:00 hours on August 15, the local time in Pakistan was 11:30pm on August 14, and hence the latter celebrates its independence on this date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/independence-day-2021-why-pakistan-celebrates-freedom-a-day-before-india-101628920124972.html
14-08-2021||World||Taliban set hard conditions for peace talks with Afghan govt||With global pressure mounting on Islamabad to push the marauding Taliban to the peace table, Rawalpindi has suggested a meeting between Afghan government leadership apart from President Ashraf Ghani and the Quetta Shura leaders in Pakistan to negotiate a power sharing settlement largely in favour of Sunni Pashtun Islamists.The earlier attempt brokered by Pakistani deep state to hold a meeting between President Ashraf Ghani and Taliban leaders, Mullah Yaqoob and Sirajuddin Haqqani, between July 17-19 failed as the Islamist leaders have no desire to talk to the current head of Afghan government. The July initiative was the brainchild of US Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad and UK Army Chief Nick Carter and the meetings with Taliban leadership were to take under the garb of a state visit of Ashraf Ghani to Pakistan. While Taliban’s ideological leader Haibatullah Akhunzada is based in Karachi, both Yaqoob and Haqqani are handling military operations of the Sunni group from Quetta and Helmand.With Taliban not willing to negotiate with President Ashraf Ghani, name of Prince Mirwais Khan, son of former King Zahir and Chairman of National Committee for Preservation of Afghan Cultural Heritage, is being floated around as a possible interlocutor for the Afghan government. Prince Mirwais is a scholar with western education and lives in Afghanistan. As of now no dates or names of interlocuter on behalf of the Afghan government have been decided.Although Taliban under pressure from ISI are willing to negotiate with Afghan government interlocutor in Pakistan, the conditions for peace forwarded by the Sunni group to Kabul are very steep. According to diplomats based in Kabul, Taliban this week has put forward three conditions to Afghanistan government for peace negotiations. They are:· All Taliban prisoners in Afghan jails should be unconditionally freed.· The Afghan government should use its good offices to get Taliban delisted as a terrorist group by the UN. Incidentally, the 1267 sanctions committee that designates individuals and entities as supporters of terrorism is headed by India.· The Taliban has proposed that President, Defence Minister, Interior Minister, Army Chief and NDS (spy agency) Chief should be from the insurgent group leaving the lame duck position of Prime Minister to the present regime in Kabul.While it is for the US and the Afghan government to decide the leader to replace Ashraf Ghani if it wants a peace settlement, the Taliban conditions appear to be humiliating to the present government as all the power will be in the hands of the Sunni Islamist force. But the present regime in Kabul has binary options left with the Taliban knocking on its door. Either it fights the Taliban and pushes it back or succumb to the peace demands of the Pak backed Islamist group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-sets-hard-conditions-for-peace-talks-with-afghan-govt-101628919740463.html

The cases have been spreading like "wildfire" among adults as well as children, they added.News agency Associated Press quoted the health officials as saying that the rapid acceleration in Covid-19 cases shows delta has the potential to unravel the state's hard-fought progress towards recovery.Even vaccination is not helping. “Vaccination progress is continuing, but not fast enough,” state Secretary of Health Umair A Shah said. “If you are unvaccinated and continue to have questions, we encourage you to speak to a trusted health care provider.”Pend Oreille, Douglas, Lincoln, Pacific, Chelan and Island counties of the Washington state are the worst affected, recording more than 600 per cent rise in Covid-19 cases in past one month.King County, Clallam, Stevens, Asotin, Whitman, Franklin, Spokane, Clark, Lewis and Pierce counties have also been ravaged by the virus.Texas and Florida are also experiencing some of the worst Covid-19 outbreaks in the United States, accounting for 40 per cent of hospitalisations over the last week, according to the White House. There too, the Delta variant has been the dominant strain which has been wreaking havoc.As you move South, healthcare workers in Georgia are also raising alarm with a surge in COvid-19 cases fuelled by the Delta variant.“I can’t comprehend why - after fighting this war for 18 months, with people still dying and with critically ill patients filling our COVID units - we’re still having to work to convince people of the seriousness of what our tireless teams are dealing with every day,” Phoebe Putney Health System President and CEO Scott Steiner said in a statement on Friday.Georgia’s case count continued to rise, with the seven-day rolling average climbing above 6,000 on Friday, the worst since February 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-causing-covid-19-cases-to-spread-like-wildfire-in-washington-101628918881118.html

The strength of the relationship between the world's two biggest democracies is more important now than ever,” said Warner, Co-Chair of the powerful Senate India Caucus. This is the largest bilateral caucus in the United States Senate.For 75 years, he said, India has moved into the future as a strong, resilient democracy.“We have seen that strength through the challenges of the last 14 months as India, America and the world has been challenged by Covid-19,” Warner said in a special video message.It was 74 years ago that India emancipated itself from British rule and began a long and storied journey toward becoming the biggest democracy in the world, said Senator Cornyn, Co-Chair of the Senate India Caucus.As co-founder of the Senate India caucus, Cornyn said he knows firsthand the importance of a strong relationship between the United States and India.“I'm proud to see how our ties have strengthened over the recent years,” he said.Joining people of India and Indian-Americans in celebrating the 75th anniversary of India's independence, Senator Rick Scott said that the United States is proud to support India, the world's largest democracy and America’s important partner and to celebrate the many contributions of our Indian American community.“Congratulations on 75 years of independence. I hope you have a wonderful celebration,” Scott said in a video message.Senator Robert Menendez, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that he is proud to join friends in Indian and Indian-American communities in New Jersey and around the world as Independence Day festivities begin.“We recognise India’s rich heritage and many global contributions, and commit to building on our countries' strong bond,” he said.Sending her independence day greetings, Sunita Williams mentioned the rich history of collaboration between India and the United States in space.“NASA and ISRO have cooperated in many different areas, including Earth and space science. Additionally, NASA has provided deep space communication and navigation support for ISRO’s missions to the Moon and Mars,” she said.“Exploring space is a global enterprise where we all need to work together. I am especially interested in following the progress of Gaganyaan, India's first human spaceflight mission,” Williams said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-senators-astronaut-sunita-williams-greet-india-on-independence-day-eve-101628909302085.html
14-08-2021||World||US warns 9/11 anniversary could inspire extremist attacks||The upcoming 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks as well as approaching religious holidays could inspire extremist attacks, the Department of Homeland Security said in a terrorism alert issued Friday.DHS did not cite any specific threats in the National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin. But it noted that the US is in a “heightened threat environment," fuelled by factors that include violent extremists motivated by racial and ethnic hatred and resentment of restrictions imposed during the pandemic.DHS issues the warnings to alert the public as well as state and local authorities. They reflect intelligence gathered from other law enforcement agencies.The bulletin is an extension of a similar one issued in May that expired on the day the new one was issued. DHS says domestic extremists remain a national threat priority for US law enforcement and will for at least the remainder of the year.The agency noted that al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula recently released the first English-language edition of its Inspire magazine in four years, apparently to mark the upcoming anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.The anniversary and the approaching holidays “could serve as a catalyst for acts of targeted violence,” it said.DHS also noted that domestic extremists motivated by religious and ethnic hatred have in the past attacked houses of worships and other gatherings, but it said there aren't any “credible or imminent threats identified to these locations.”As in previous bulletins, DHS expressed concern about both domestic extremists, motivated by “personal grievances and extremist ideological beliefs,” and foreign influences.The agency said Russian, Chinese and Iranian government-linked media outlets have helped spread conspiracy theories about the origins of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of vaccines and have in some cases amplified calls for violence against people of Asian descent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warns-9-11-anniversary-could-inspire-extremist-attacks-101628908838015.html

14-08-2021||World||Kandahar falls, Taliban on way to Kabul’s gates||The Taliban completed their sweep of the country’s south on Friday as they took four more provincial capitals in a lightning offensive that is gradually encircling Kabul, just weeks before the US is set to officially end its two-decade war.In just the last 24 hours, the country’s second- and third-largest cities — Herat in the west and Kandahar in the south — have fallen as has the capital of the southern Helmand province, where American, British and NATO forces fought some of the bloodiest battles of the conflict.The blitz through the Taliban’s southern heartland means the insurgents now hold half of Afghanistan’s 34 provincial capitals and control more than two-thirds of the country.The Western-backed government in the capital, Kabul, still holds a smattering of provinces in the centre and east, as well as the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif.While Kabul isn’t directly under threat yet, the resurgent Taliban were battling government forces in Logar province, some 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the capital. The US military has estimated that Kabul could come under insurgent pressure within 30 days and that the Taliban could overrun the rest of the country within a few months. They have already taken over much of the north and west of the country.The blitz pushed the US to rush 3,000 fresh troops in a temporary deployment to speed evacuation flights for some American diplomats and thousands of Afghans. The Pentagon also was moving another 4,500 to 5,000 troops to bases in the Gulf countries of Qatar and Kuwait, including 1,000 to Qatar to speed up visa processing for Afghan translators and others who fear retribution from the Taliban for their past work with Americans, and their family members.India, Germany, Qatar, Turkey and several other nations have reaffirmed to not recognise any government in Afghanistan that is imposed through the use of military force and called for an immediate end to violence and attacks in the war-torn country.A statement issued by Qatar on Friday following two separate meetings on Afghanistan in Doha said the participating countries agreed that the Afghan peace process needs to be accelerated as a matter of “great urgency”.In the south of Afghanistan, the insurgents swept through the three provincial capitals on Friday.Attaullah Afghan, the head of the provincial council in Helmand, said that the Taliban captured Lashkar Gah following weeks of heavy fighting and raised their white flag over governmental buildings. He said that three national army bases outside of the city remain under control of the government.Atta Jan Haqbayan, the provincial council chief in Zabul province, said the local capital of Qalat fell and that officials were in a nearby army camp preparing to leave. Bismillah Jan Mohammad and Qudratullah Rahimi, lawmakers from Uruzgan province, said local officials surrendered Tirin Kot. Taliban fighters paraded through a main square there, driving a Humvee and a pickup seized from Afghan security forces.Danish broadcaster TV2, meanwhile, quoted foreign minister Jeppe Kofod as saying that the country’s embassy in Kabul is closing temporarily and staff are being evacuated. Germany is reducing its embassy staff in Kabul to “the operationally necessary, absolute minimum,” foreign minister Heiko Maas told reporters Friday, as he urged all German citizens to leave the country immediately.Thousands of Afghans have fled their homes amid fears the Taliban will return the country to the sort of brutal, repressive rule it imposed when it was last in power at the turn of the millennium. At that time, the group all but eliminated women’s rights and conducted public executions as it imposed an unsparing version of Islamic law.An early sign of such tactics came in Herat, where insurgents paraded two alleged looters through the streets on Friday with black makeup smeared on their faces.There are also concerns that the fighting could plunge the country into civil war, which is what happened after the Soviets withdrew in 1989. Peace talks in Qatar between the Taliban and the government remain stalled, though diplomats are still meeting, as the US, European and Asian nations warned that battlefield gains would not lead to political recognition.“We demand an immediate end to attacks against cities, urge a political settlement, and warn that a government imposed by force will be a pariah state,” said Zalmay Khalilzad, the US envoy to the talks.But the Taliban advance continued.The onslaught represents a stunning collapse of Afghan forces after the United States spent nearly two decades and $830 billion trying to establish a functioning state. US forces toppled the Taliban in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which al-Qaida planned and executed while being sheltered by the Taliban government. The fighters now advancing across the country ride on American-made Humvees and carry M-16s pilfered from Afghan forces.Bill Roggio, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the Afghan army has rotted from within due to corruption and mismanagement, leaving troops in the field poorly equipped and with little motivation to fight. The Taliban, meanwhile, have spent a decade taking control of large swaths of the countryside. That allowed them to rapidly seize key infrastructure and urban areas once President Joe Biden announced the timeline for the US withdrawal, saying he was determined to end America’s longest war.“Whatever forces are left or remaining that are in the Kabul area and the provinces around them, they’re going to be used for the defense of Kabul,” Roggio said. “Unless something dramatically changes, and I don’t see how that’s possible, these provinces (that have fallen) will remain under Taliban control.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kandahar-falls-taliban-on-way-to-kabul-s-gates-101628905938619.html
14-08-2021||World||Canadian PM Trudeau likely to hold snap polls to win majority||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appears set to take the risk of holding snap elections to secure a majority in the House of Commons despite health authorities formally declaring that a fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is now under way.According to multiple news outlets, Trudeau is expected to meet governor-general Mary Simon on Sunday for starting the election process, formally called dropping of the writ, and snap polls will be held on September 20.This was first reported by Reuters and the French-language outlet La Presse and confirmed by others. The Hindustan Times has also confirmed this likelihood.The Trudeau-led Liberal Party government is in a minority in the House of Commons, with 155 MPs, as against 119 for the principal Opposition party, the Conservatives.When the last federal elections were held in October 2019, the Liberals captured 157 seats, short of the 170 majority mark and also trailed the Conservatives in vote share, with 31.1% against 34.3%.However, most polls have suggested the Liberals have a lead now, with the latest from the non-profit Angus Reid Institute putting them at 36% support, five points ahead of the Conservatives.But it stated, “As members of the fifth estate speculate about the exact date the prime minister is expected to call a general election, Canadians are more occupied by fears of a fourth wave of Covid-19 than politics.”In fact, 52% of respondents fear contracting the coronavirus, a five-point increase over the figure for July.Their fears will not be assuaged by the statement on Thursday from Canada’s chief public health officer Theresa Tam, who told reporters during a briefing, “We have been closely monitoring increases in Covid-19 activity across the country.“The latest national surveillance data indicate that a fourth wave is under way in Canada and that cases are plotting along a strong resurgence trajectory.”She also said there were more than 13,000 active cases in the country, more than double the figure for late July.When questioned about the possible election, Tam demurred and said, “It’s not my role to advise on whether there should be an election or not.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-trudeau-likely-to-hold-snap-polls-to-win-majority-101628905223907.html

But China rejects the politicisation of the probe, Chinese state media quoted Ma as saying.US: FDA gives nod to extra dose of vaccineThe US on Thursday authorised an extra dose of Covid vaccine for people with weakened immune systems, as the country struggles to thwart the Delta variant. Emergency use authorisation for a third injection of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines was granted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulator. “The country has entered yet another wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the FDA is especially cognisant that immunocompromised people are particularly at risk for severe disease,” said acting FDA commissioner Janet Woodcock.Israel expands campaign for booster shotsIsrael on Friday lowered to 50 from 60 the minimum age of eligibility for a Covid-19 vaccine booster shot and will also offer them to health workers, hoping to stem a surge in Delta variant infections. The director-general of Israel’s health ministry, Nachman Ash, accepted a recommendation late on Thursday by an expert advisory panel to expand third shot eligibility of the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine.Those eligible will be “people over 50, health care workers, people with severe risk factors for the coronavirus, prisoners and wardens”.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-shoots-down-2nd-who-probe-into-covid-virus-origin-101628905013889.html

As the security situation worsens, the Afghan people are leaving their homes to reach relatively safer places.The Canadian minister of immigration, refugees, and citizenship said that the country is expeditiously carrying out special resettlement operations to evacuate Afghan nationals who provided critical support to the Canadian mission. The recent expansion to the immigration programme is an addition to the earlier initiative undertaken by the country to welcome the thousands of Afghans who worked for the Canadian government, such as interpreters, embassy workers, and their families.“Many more Afghan lives are now under increasing threat and many have already fled,” the minister added. He, however, did not provide a timetable for the resettlement programme.Canada's defence minister Harjit Sajjan also said that the country has signed an MoU with the Manmeet Singh Bhullar foundation to resettle a group of vulnerable Afghan Sikh and Hindu families out of Afghanistan. “Over the next several months, we will expand this programme to resettle several hundred remaining Sikhs and Hindus,” the minister said.Also Read | How will India ensure safety of Afghan Hindus, Sikhs from Taliban violence?

They live in a village, and network connectivity is poor there. Taliban has captured many major capitals,” news agency ANI quoted Siddiqui as saying.Siddiqui, who has been living in India for the past four years, said that the present situation in Afghanistan is disturbing. “I am living in India for past four years. Present situation in Afghanistan is disturbing. I have been told that the Taliban is abducting young boys, taking them to Pakistan, marrying young girls and forcing them to wear hijab (veil). Girls can not walk around freely now,” he further said.Following the withdrawal of US troops from the country, the Taliban have increased their violence and have captured at least 15 provincial capitals. Several news reports emerged of the violence committed by the group on civilians.Another report showed that the Taliban has banned the Covid-19 vaccines in Paktia in east Afghanistan. They had also put up a notice about the same on the Paktia regional Regional Hospital.Earlier on Friday, the Taliban took over the capital of Logar province, located just 50kms to the south of Kabul.

I assure you that the government is ready and will continue to always meet your and your loved ones' needs," he said, in comments that came in the backdrop of the deteriorating security scenario in Afghanistan.Singh said the Indian civilisation has always been peaceful since ancient times, but peace is not possible without power."If non-violence is our ultimate duty, protecting the integrity of the nation is equally important. Therefore, we are ready to sacrifice anything for unity and integrity of the nation," he said."In order to maintain peace and prosperity in the country, it is necessary that you should be alert and aware in protecting the nation wherever you are in water, land or sky," he said.The defence minister also said that the situation along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir remained in check over the last year due to vigilance and indomitable valour of the Indian armed forces."Ceasefire violations have also come down since February 2021. The infiltration from across the border has stopped due to vigilance of the armed forces and para-military forces," he said in the address aired on All India Radio."In eastern Ladakh, efforts are being made to resolve the differences on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) through dialogue with China. The process of disengagement has been completed at some places," he said referring to the border row with China.Both sides have already disengaged from areas around the North and South banks of Pangong lake as well as from Gogra.Referring to Army Subedar Neeraj Chopra's feat, Singh said he has made this year's Independence Day even sweeter by winning the gold medal in the Javelin throw event at the Tokyo Olympics."Subedar Neeraj as well as other Olympic medalists have been specially invited to the Independence Day celebrations at the Red Fort tomorrow. I thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji for this," Singh said.The minister greeted the armed forces on the occasion of Independence Day."The nation is ushering in an important phase of Independence from midnight today, the 75th year of it. There is an atmosphere of celebration all around the country on this momentous occasion," he said.The defence minister said the government has always been aware of the operational requirements of the armed force, adding the capital outlay has been increased from ₹1.13 lakh crore to ₹1.35 lakh crore in the Union Budget for 2021-22.He assured the armed forces that the government will take every step to protect the country.Referring to the acquisition of Rafale fighter jets to maintain the "operational edge" of the Indian Air Force, Singh said 26 aircraft out of 36 have already arrived in India and the remaining ones too will reach soon, adding the fleet will bring qualitative enhancement in the defence capability of the force.The defence minister said Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC) Vikrant completed its four-day maiden sea voyage on August 8 and that the construction of the warship is a major achievement of the 'Make in India' initiatives."In another important initiative of 'Make in India', Ministry of Defence has launched a project worth over ₹40,000 crore for construction of six conventional submarines named Project 75 (India) for Indian Navy on July 20," he said.He said the Request for Proposal (RFP) under the strategic partnership model has been issued for the programme to the partners selected for it, adding that these submarines will be very effective in protecting India's strategic interests.Singh also mentioned the Defence Research and Development Organisation's (DRDO) recent successful demonstration of the hypersonic scramjet technology with the testing of Hypersonic Technology Demonstration Vehicle (HSTDV).He also talked about the successful test-fired Agni P and some other missiles.The defence minister said that the government constituted the Special Number 5 Selection Board in September 2020 for the permanent commission of women officers following a judgement on the matter by the Supreme Court.He said on the recommendation of the board, permanent commission was awarded to some officers in November last year."The Supreme Court in March 2021 had passed another order for permanent commission to women officers..."Thereafter, on the recommendation of the Board, 147 more women officers were awarded permanent commission last month," he said.So far, 424 women officers out of 615 have availed this benefit, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dimensions-of-security-are-constantly-changing-rajnath-singh-to-armed-forces-101628964653501.html
14-08-2021||India||Amid rapid deterioration of security in Afghanistan, India may grant refuge to Afghans||The Indian government may grant refuge to Afghan citizens, especially those facing threats or fearing persecution from the Taliban, against the backdrop of the rapid deterioration of the security situation in Afghanistan. Afghans have begun leaving key cities following the rapid advances by the Taliban into urban centres over the past week. As many as 18 out of 34 provincial capital across Afghanistan are now under the control of the Taliban, including some of the largest cities such as Herat and Kandahar. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that there was no immediate update on the issue of granting visas to Afghan nationals fleeing their country though discussions on the matter were underway. Among those who are likely to be granted refuge are political leaders or activists, human rights workers, media personnel, members of minorities and people who have worked with the Indian government, the people said. There has been a sharp increase in requests for Indian visas in Kabul over the past few weeks. Images shared on social media on Saturday showed the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul packed with people waiting for flights out of the country. The airport is currently one of the few ways out of the country and there were reports of people waiting as long as three hours to get into the terminal after buying tickets at counters set up in the parking lot outside. Air India, Emirates, FlyDubai, Pakistan International Airlines and Turkish Airlines are among the airlines currently operating flights to Kabul. With the fall of several provincial capitals surrounding Kabul and the capture of Logar province, located just 11 km south of the city, fears have grown that the Taliban could be knocking at the doors of the capital within a week, if not days. India has provided refuge to several Afghan leaders and their families amid the turmoil of the past four decades. Afghan chief negotiator Abdullah Abdullah’s family currently lives in India and others such as former president Hamid Karzai have lived and studied in the country. Asked about the possibility of India offering refuge to Afghanistan’s Hindu and Sikh minorities at last week’s media briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said the government is keeping a close eye on all developments related to the two communities. “Last year, our mission in Kabul had facilitated the return of 383 members of the Sikh and Hindu communities in Afghanistan. Our mission continues to remain in touch with the Afghan Hindu and Sikh community members and we will ensure the provision of all necessary assistance to them,” he said. Several countries have announced plans to give refuge to Afghans facing threats, especially those who have worked with Western countries or foreign troops over the years. The US has plans to help thousands of Afghans under its special immigrant visa programme or as refugees, while Canada has announced it will take in up to 20,000 Afghan refugees, including women leaders, government workers and people facing threats from the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-rapid-deterioration-of-security-in-afghanistan-india-may-grant-refuge-to-afghans-101628965324352.html

14-08-2021||India||Kerala starts mass vaccination drive as Covid-19 cases surge||With coronavirus cases climbing steadily, the Kerala government on Saturday started a mass vaccination programme even as Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya is arriving in the state on Monday to review the pandemic situation. For more than two months the state has been reporting the maximum number of cases in the country. With its containment measures failing to evoke desired results the government feels that maximum inoculation is the only way to reduce the caseload. A meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday decided to conduct a special vaccination drive and has approached the Centre for uninterrupted supply of Covid-19 vaccines. The district collectors have been asked to supervise the special drive and at least five lakh vaccines will be administered a day. The state has a stock of 15 lakh doses now and it expects another 10 lakh in a couple of days, a senior health ministry official said. Recipients can avail them through spot registration or online booking. The government has also made permission mandatory for all public activities during the ongoing Onam season_ Thiru Onam falls on next Sunday (August 21). Many experts have warned the state that there can be a surge after Onam so the government has tightened restrictions. In the prevailing situation, the festival will be subdued as the government has banned mass gathering and feasts. The Union health minister will reach the state capital on Monday and has scheduled a meeting with the CM and health minister Veena George later in the day. He will be accompanied by Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, National Centre for Disease Control Director Sujit Singh and other experts. Kerala reported 19,451 positive cases with a test positivity rate of 13.91 per cent after 1,39,223 samples were tested on Saturday, according to the state health ministry. It also reported 105 deaths taking total fatalities to 18,499. Malappuram remained on top with 2953 cases followed by Thrissur district at 2459. Four districts reported more than 2000 new Covid-19 cases. Active cases also rose to 1,80,240. In the last 24 hours, the country reported 38,677 new cases and 478 deaths. The current caseload is 3,83,673. In daily cases, deaths and active cases Kerala contributes the lion’s share, statistics show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-starts-mass-vaccination-drive-as-covid-19-cases-surge-101628963825113.html

Children will be more susceptible,” he said, mentioning why children might be more exposed. Further he also pointed out that more than half of the children have already been infected by the coronavirus, according to the sero survey, and currently possess antibodies against the disease. He also expressed hope that a Covid-19 vaccine for children would also be coming up in a month or two, so that they could also be immunised against the disease.As far as the vaccines are concerned, Dr Guleria said that the jabs were still effective in preventing severe cases of the infection. He also highlighted that people getting reinfected even after the vaccinations are only experiencing mild infections, with the vaccines offering protection from severe cases. “Vaccines are helping in preventing severe disease and death from Covid-19. Infections are still happening but those infected are predominantly those who have not been vaccinated. That’s why we are saying more and more people need to get vaccinated,” he said. “Those getting infected even after vaccination, what we call breakthrough infection, are predominantly getting milder infection. So vaccines are effective in giving protection from severe disease,” he added.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-third-wave-might-not-be-as-severe-as-second-wave-vaccines-still-effective-aiims-chief-dr-randeep-guleria-101628962575202.html

The bench of Justice Subodh Abhyankar said that the boy entering into a physical relationship with a girl has to realise that his actions will have consequences."…barring some exceptions...it has not yet reached such level (advance or lower) of civilization where unmarried girls, regardless of their religion,indulge in carnal activities with boys just for the fun of it, unless the same is backed by some future promise/assurance of marriage and to prove her point, it is not necessary every time for a victim to try to commit suicide as in the present case," the court observed.The court made these observations hearing an alleged rape case. The girl tried to commit suicide. The counsel for the boy claimed they were in a relationship and it was a consensual act. The court said it does not find it to be a fit case for grant of bail as apparently the accused allured the girl on the pretext of marriage "despite knowing fully well that both of them are from different religion""In majority of the cases of rape, the defence of the accused is that the prosecutrix was a consenting party and in most of the cases the accused gets the benefit of doubt also," the court said.That the girl tried t commit suicide shows that she was serious about the relationship and it cannot be said that she entered into the relationship for enjoyment, the court observed."It is the girl who is always at the receiving end because it is she who runs the risk of being pregnant and also her ignominy in the society, if her relationship is disclosed. You just cannot plead consent on the part of the prosecutrix and laugh all the way to your home," the judgment read||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unmarried-girls-in-india-don-t-enter-physical-relationship-unless-promised-marriage-madhya-pradesh-high-court-101628960079435.html

Senior officials said that while the government has managed to give at least one dose to 75% of population in urban centres like Kolkata, the government plans to vaccinate at least 50% of the population in the rural areas of adjoining districts with one dose. “Once local trains are allowed, people from the adjoining districts would come to the city in large numbers. At present only limited number of people are coming because only buses have been allowed. Trains are suspended. For this we need to speed up things and vaccinate as many people as we can in the rural areas in the adjoining districts,” said a senior health department official. Even though the state government has relaxed Covid-19 restrictions allowing buses, Kolkata Metro, auto-rickshaws and cabs, locals trains continue to remain cancelled. “There is a possibility that the third wave may hit in September. We have to keep Covid-19 cases under control. People may have grievances because local trains are not running. But life is more important,” Mamata Banerjee, chief minister had said earlier this week. Local suburban trains connect Kolkata and Howrah with the villages and towns of the adjoining districts and thus form a major lifeline for the people coming to Kolkata for jobs every day. Howrah and Sealdah stations cater to more than two million passengers every day. “The government is targeting districts like South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly, Nadia and parts of Bardhhaman where 50% of the people need to be vaccinated with at least one dose before local trains resume,” said another official. In Kolkata, while around 38 lakh people have received the first dose, around 13.5 lakh people have received their second dose. The city has a population of around 45 lakhs as per the 2011 census. Compared to this North 24 Parganas, which is the second most densely populated district in India and has a population of more than one crore, received around 26 lakh first doses. In South 24 Parganas, 12.8 lakh people received the first dose while in Nadia only around nine lakh people have received the first dose. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has shot off letters to the Prime Minister demanding more vaccines. She had said that even though the state has the capacity to give around 11 lakh vaccines every day, only around three to four lakhs vaccines are being given due to short supply. The ruling Trinamool Congress has been mounting pressure on the Election Commission to hold elections and by-elections in seven assembly seats which are due citing low Covid-19 cases in the state. On Saturday, West Bengal registered 707 new cases and 15 deaths. With 88 new cases North 24 Parganas reported the highest number of cases, while Kolkata registered 82 cases. The six districts including Kolkata, South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly and Nadia together account for 50% of the new cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-government-to-speed-up-vaccination-in-kolkata-s-suburbs-to-resume-local-trains-101628957283562.html

Without the TMC, an alliance or any front is not possible,” he added.Mitra further told ANI that ‘khela hobe’ will be celebrated in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Tripura, Haryana, Bihar and many other states. “Some will celebrate under the flag of Trinamool Congress while many others may not use any party symbol. But the slogan Khela Hobe will reach across India,” he said.Notably, West Bengal chief minister and TMC supremo was on a five-day visit to the national capital between July 26 and 30. During her trip, she met many important party leaders, including Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) head and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi, among others.

14-08-2021||India||Full text of President Ram Nath Kovind's Independence Day eve address||President Ram Nath Kovind addressed citizens on the eve of India’s 75th Independence Day. “It is a matter of great joy for me to wish all Indians, living in India and abroad, a very Happy Independence Day!” the President said starting off his televised address on Saturday.Read the full text here:It is a matter of great joy for me to wish all Indians, living in India and abroad, a very Happy Independence Day! This day has a special significance as it marks the beginning of the 75th year of India’s independence for which ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ is being celebrated. My hearty congratulations to you all on this momentous occasion!Independence Day is a festival of freedom for us. This was made possible by generations of freedom fighters; some known, many unknown. They made great sacrifices. Today, you and I breathe under free skies thanks to their heroic deeds. I bow in respect to the pious memory of those brave martyrs.Our nation, like many others, suffered great injustices and tyranny under foreign rule. What distinguishes India, however, is that the character of our nationalist movement, led by Mahatma Gandhi, was based on the principles of truth and non-violence. He and all other national heroes provided us with an invaluable blueprint to not only liberate the nation from colonial rule but also to rebuild it. Gandhiji’s struggle was for a return to Indian ethos and for human dignity.Also Read: No infrastructure could withstand the crisis of 2nd wave of Covid: PresidentNow as we look back to the seventy-five-year journey of our republic, we have reasons to be proud of the considerable distance we have travelled. Gandhiji taught us that slow and steady steps in the right direction are preferable to rapid strides in the wrong direction. The world looks up at the miracle of India, home to the plurality of traditions and yet the biggest and most vibrant democracy.Dear Fellow Citizens,In the recently concluded Tokyo Olympics, our sportspersons have brought laurels to the nation with their stellar performances. India has won the highest number of medals in the 121 years of its participation in the Olympics. Our daughters have achieved world-class excellence in playgrounds overcoming many adversities. Along with sports, epoch-making changes are taking place in the participation and success of women in all walks of life. From higher educational institutions to armed forces, from laboratories to playgrounds, our daughters are making their mark. In this success of our daughters, I see a glimpse of a developed India of the future. I urge every parent to learn from the families of such promising daughters and provide opportunities to their daughters also to explore avenues of growth.Like last year, this year too, the scale of Independence Day celebration may have been reduced due to pandemic, yet our hearts remain always filled with enthusiasm. The intensity of the pandemic has come down, but the coronavirus has not yet gone away. We are yet to come out of the devastating effects of its recurrence this year. Last year, with exceptional efforts from all, we had succeeded in bringing the spread of infections under control. Our scientists had succeeded in developing vaccines in a very short time. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, there was every reason to be hopeful as we launched the largest vaccination exercise in history. Yet, due to the new variants and other unexpected factors, we suffered from a terrible second wave. I am deeply sad that many lives could not be saved and many more suffered immensely in this phase of an unprecedented crisis. I speak for the whole nation when I say that I share the grief of all the affected families with the same intensity.The science is coping with this invisible enemy of terrible might with remarkable speed. We can take solace from the fact that more lives have been saved than the lives lost. It was our collective determination to overcome the challenge that helped us see the weakening of the second wave. Once again, our corona warriors, the doctors, nurses and health workers, the administrators, and others, risked everything to contain the impact of the second wave.The second wave brought our public healthcare infrastructure under stress. The reality is that no infrastructure, even of advanced economies, could withstand a crisis of such enormous proportions. Efforts were made on war-footing to plug the gaps. The leadership rose to the challenge, and the government’s endeavours were supplemented by initiatives of the states, private sector healthcare facilities, the civil society and others. In this extraordinary mission, foreign nations shared the essentials generously, just as India had reached out to many nations with medicine, equipment and vaccines. I am grateful to the global fraternity that came forward with a helping hand.Due to these efforts, the nation breathes a sigh of relief with the return of a semblance of normalcy. If we have learned our lessons well, we know that this is the time of extra care and caution. We shall not let our guard down. Vaccines are the best possible protection science offers to us. Under the world's biggest vaccination campaign going on in our country, more than 50 crore fellow citizens have been vaccinated so far. I urge all eligible citizens who are yet to get vaccinated to do so at the earliest and also inspire others.Dear Fellow Citizens,The economic impact of the pandemic is as disastrous as its health impact. The government has been concerned about the lower middle classes and the poor, as well as about the small and medium industries. It has been sensitive to the needs of the labourers and of employers who have been facing hardships due to the lockdowns and movement restrictions. Sensitive to their needs, the government had taken a series of relief measures last year. This year also, the government had distributed food grains to about 80 crore people in May and June. This benefit has been extended till Diwali. Moreover, the government has announced a new stimulus package worth Rupees 6 lakh 28 thousand crore to boost the selected Covid-affected sectors. In particular, it is heartening to note that an amount of Rupees 23 thousand 220 crore is being spent over one year for expansion of medical facilities.It is heartening to note that rural India, particularly the agriculture sector has kept growing against all odds. In a recent visit to my ancestral village Paraunkh in Kanpur Dehat district, I was quite pleased to find that better infrastructure is being developed to make life better for people in rural areas. The psychological distance between the urban and the rural is now much less as compared to the past. After all, India lives in its villages which cannot be allowed to lag behind in development. That is why special campaigns, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, are being implemented for the welfare of our farmers.These efforts are consistent with the vision of an Atma Nirbhar Bharat, a self-reliant India. With abiding faith in the inherent capacity of the economy, the government has further opened up defence, health, civil aviation, power and other sectors. The government’s new initiatives to promote eco-friendly, renewable sources of energy, particularly solar power, have won praise around the world. If there is an improvement in the ease of doing business, it has a positive impact on the ease of living for all. In addition to these, special emphasis is being given to public welfare. For example, the dream of having a home of one’s own is being realised, thanks to the Rupees 70,000 crore credit-linked subsidy scheme. The series of agricultural marketing reforms will empower our ‘annadata’ farmers and help them get better price for their produce. These are some of the measures the government has taken to unleash the potential of every Indian.Dear Fellow Citizens,A new dawn is rising in Jammu and Kashmir. The government has initiated the process of consultation with all stakeholders who have faith in democracy and the rule of law. I urge the people, especially the youth, of Jammu and Kashmir to utilise this opportunity and work on realising their aspirations through democratic institutions.With all-round progress, India’s stature is rising in the international arena, as it was reflected in our participation in several key multilateral forums as well as in consolidating bilateral relationships with several countries.Dear Fellow Citizens,When India won Independence 75 years ago, many sceptics thought democracy would not survive in India. Little did they know that roots of democracy were nurtured in this soil in ancient times, and even in modern times India was ahead of many western nations in offering franchise to all adults, regardless of any distinctions. The founding fathers had reposed their faith in the wisdom of the people, and ‘we, the people of India’ have made India a strong democracy.We have adopted the system of parliamentary democracy. Therefore, our Parliament is the temple of our democracy which provides us highest forum where we discuss, debate and decide issues for the well-being of our people. It is a matter of great pride for all Indians that our Parliament will soon be housed in a new building. It will be a fitting statement of our outlook: It will honour our legacy while also walking in step with the contemporary world. It is more than symbolic that the new building will be inaugurated in the year of the 75th anniversary of Independence.The government has planned many initiatives to make this special year memorable, and the most exciting of them all may as well be the Gaganyaan mission. Pilots of the Indian Air Force have been receiving training abroad. When they fly off into space, India will become only the fourth nation on the planet to carry out a manned space mission. When it comes to the flights of our ambitions, we don’t let any limitations define us.Yet we keep our feet on the ground. We acknowledge that we still have a long way to go in realising the dreams of those who won the freedom for us. Our Constitution neatly summarises those dreams in four words: Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. We must strive for more equality in an unequal world, more justice in unjust circumstances. Justice has come to encompass a larger range of connotations, including economic and environmental justice. The road ahead is not easy. We will have to negotiate many twists and turns, but we have the benefit of incomparable guidance. It comes to us from diverse sources, from the venerable seers of millennia ago, down to the sages and leaders of more recent times. In the spirit of “unity in diversity”, we as a nation are following the right course.This vision derived from the unique Indian heritage is going to be helpful not only to us but to the whole world in this century. Modern industrial civilization has posed serious challenges before humankind. Climate change has become a reality of life, with seas rising, glaciers melting and temperatures soaring. India is proud of not only adhering to the Paris climate agreement but doing more than what the country has committed to protect the climate. However, the world desperately needs a course correction. This is why the world is increasingly turning to the wisdom of India, as created by the authors of the Vedas and Upanishads, as depicted in the Ramayana and Mahabharata, as taught by Lord Mahavira, Lord Buddha and Guru Nanak and as reflected in the lives of the likes of Mahatma Gandhi.Learning the art of living in tune with nature requires effort, Gandhiji says, but once you establish a relationship with rivers and mountains, birds and animals, nature reveals its secrets to you. Let us resolve to listen to this message of Gandhiji and also to make sacrifices for the sake of the land we live in.The spirit of patriotism and sacrifice was paramount among our freedom fighters. They faced all kinds of challenges without caring for their own interests. I have seen that in the face of Corona crisis, lakhs of people have taken enormous risks to protect others, with the spirit of selfless service for humanity. I convey my profound appreciation for all such covid warriors. Many of them succumbed to Covid-19. I pay homage to them.Recently, on the occasion of 'Kargil Vijay Diwas', I wanted to visit the 'Kargil War Memorial - Dras' in Ladakh to pay homage to our brave soldiers. But due to bad weather, it was not possible for me to reach that monument. On that day, I paid homage to our brave soldiers at the 'Dagger War Memorial' in Baramulla. That memorial has been built in the memory of all the soldiers who have made the supreme sacrifice in their line of duty. While appreciating the valour and sacrifice of those brave warriors, I noticed that the war memorial has a motto inscribed: “मेरा हर काम, देश के नाम” which means, each and every deed of mine is for the nation.All of us should imbibe this motto as a mantra and work with full devotion and dedication for the development of the nation. I would like that all of us come together to take India forward on the path of progress with the spirit of keeping the interest of the nation and society foremost.Dear Fellow Citizens,I extend my greetings especially to the members of the armed forces, who have guarded our freedom, valiantly and gladly making supreme sacrifice when necessary. I also extend my greetings to the members of the Indian diaspora, who have represented the motherland well wherever they have made home.I once again congratulate all of you, on the eve of India’s 75th Independence Day. While celebrating this anniversary, I cannot stop my mind from imagining a powerful, prosperous and peaceful India of 2047 when we will celebrate 100 years of our independence.I wish that all our people come out of the difficulties caused by the Covid pandemic and move ahead on the path of happiness and prosperity.Once again, my best wishes to all of you!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/full-text-of-president-ram-nath-kovind-s-independence-day-eve-address-101628955710154.html

UK cuts cost of Covid-19 test on arrival||Indian students, professionals flying to the United Kingdom were exempt from mandatory government quarantine as the UK moved India to its amber list. But under the rules of the amber list, Indian passengers still have to take a paid test just after their arrival in England, the cost of which is 88 pounds ( ₹9,055). Receiving complaints that it was a lot of money for students and even holidaymakers, the UK government has reduced the price to 66 pounds ( ₹6,791). The price reduction does not affect arrivals from Red list countries, or if they purchase a test from a private provider, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said, news agency PTI reported.India's upgrade to Amber list has come to the rescue of thousands of Indian students as they have been saved of the cost of 1,750 pounds ( ₹1.80 lakh) that they would have required for mandatory hotel quarantine which is a rule in the UK for passengers coming from Red List countries. Now students can quarantine at their place of stay, university hostel, for the recent move.This year, a record number of 3,200 students from India have been accepted into UK colleges and universities, which is 19 per cent more than 2020.The high airfare in the Delhi-London route because of pent-up demand became a cause for concern as many pointed out that Delhi-London one-way airfare reached around ₹4 lakh. The civil aviation ministry urged travellers to check the fare from the airlines' website and not from search engines as they do not reflect the actual fare and after making combinations of multiple airlines show some exaggerated figure.The number of flights between India to the United Kingdom has also been increased which is expected to bring down the ticket prices. India-UK flights were suspended in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic in India. The United Kingdom has not yet moved Pakistan from thered list to the amber list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/good-news-for-indian-students-uk-cuts-covid-19-testing-cost-101628954121279.html

He said they were trying to unleash the same “goondaism (rowdyism)” in the parliament. “It seems some of them have got good lessons from the school of state minister V Sivankutty,” he said while showing pictures of MPs standing on the desk of the Rajya Sabha. The pictures showed the Communist Party of India’s Binoy Viswom and V Sivadasan of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Elamarom Kareem, a third member of Parliament from Kerala, is accused of attacking marshals in Rajya Sabha. Sivankutty is one of the accused in the 2016 assembly violence case. The Supreme Court last month ordered he and five other former legislators will face criminal charges for destroying assembly property during protests in the Kerala assembly in 2016. Sivankutty is accused of damaging a mike, furniture, and hopping from one desk to another. Muraleedharan, who is from Kerala, cited the pictures and said they show what really happened in Rajya Sabha. “Assembly-model violence and goondaism will not be allowed in parliament. Those responsible will have to answer for their irresponsible behaviour in the House,” he said.Kareem has denied the charges against him and sought action against marshals for assaulting opposition lawmakers. He wrote a letter to the Rajya Sabha secretary general and asked him to check the visuals of the House to get a clear picture. Viswom has also denied allegations against him.Sivadasan and Sivankutty were unavailable for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muraleedharan-accuses-kerala-mps-of-trying-to-re-enact-in-parliament-2016-assembly-violence-101628941861007.html

Parts of the lower primary school known as Sahebmara LP School has been damaged in the second such instance in this area after Muliwala Lower Primary School was bombed in February this year by unknown miscreants.Sahebmara LP School, located within two kilometres of the Assam-Mizoram Border, demarcated by Survey of India map, was attacked by grenades while it was closed due to the second wave of Covid-19 outbreak.Hailakandi’s superintendent of police (SP) Gaurav Upadhyay said the latest incident happened at around 11:30 pm on Friday but no person was injured. “The bombing was done by miscreants from Mizoram side between 11 to 11:30 pm. The area comes under Ghutghuti police outpost and we have raised the security immediately after the incident. We are trying to ensure that this incident does not create fear among the residents in the locality. We are also investigating the matter and once it is completed, we’ll be able to give a clearer picture,” He said.In February this year, unknown miscreants used grenades to damage Muliwala Lower Primary School, resulting in hundreds of families moving out of the area in fear. “There has been a series of attempts to terrorise locals by unknown miscreants from Mizoram side throughout the year. They mostly target the government buildings to create panic among the civilians,” said a local from Hailakandi.The border dispute between the two states resulted in an exchange of fire between the policemen from both sides on July 26, causing the death of six Assam policemen and one resident. More than 60 people from Assam, including superintendent of police of Cachar district, sustained severe injuries. Few persons from Mizoram side were also injured.Following the clashes, a 10-day-long economic blockade in Assam prevented transport of goods to Mizoram, resulting in a price rise of essential goods in the state. Under the instruction of the Central government, both Assam and Mizoram have agreed to resolve the border dispute peacefully.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/24-hrs-before-independence-day-school-bombed-near-assam-mizoram-border-101628940721104.html

This was the first separate budget for agriculture in the state, which MK Stalin-led Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) had promised in its poll manifesto for the state assembly elections earlier this year.MRK Panneerselvam, the minister for agriculture and farmer’s welfare, presented the budget and said that it was in line with the views of farmers and experts, whose opinions were sought before preparing it. “The agriculture budget is the aspiration of farmers. It is a dream of nature lovers,” he said.The minister announced that a sum of ₹34,220.65 crore will be allocated for agriculture and related departments like animal husbandry, fisheries, dairy development, irrigation, rural development, sericulture and forest for the year 2021-22. Also, for providing free of cost electricity to farm pump sets, an amount of ₹4,508.23 crore has been earmarked for the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO), the state-run electricity entity.Also read | Climate crisis fund, petrol tax cut part of Tamil Nadu budgetWhile the previous All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government had declared the Cauvery delta region as a protected agriculture zone, Panneerselvam proposed to declare the area as an agro-industrial corridor. It was aimed at bringing more prosperity to farmers and farm labourers in the delta region and to promote agro based industries, he added.Further, he said that in places such as Thanjavur, where rice, pulses, banana and coconut are grown throughout the year, rice and oil mills, coir units and pulse processing units would contribute more to the welfare of farmers and farm workers. These industries are promoted to use agricultural products grown in these regions to produce more value added products, he saidUnder the plan named Kalaignarin Anaithu Grama Orunginaintha Velaan Valarchi Thittam (named after former chief minister M Karunanidhi) costing ₹1,245.45 crore, overall agricultural development and self-sufficiency would be ensured in all villages of the state, he said. The plan will be implemented in 2,500 village panchayats in the current year. Moreover, each year, one-fifth of the total 12,524 villages in Tamil Nadu will be identified over the next five years where the scheme will be implemented, the minister said. The major objectives of the scheme include turning fallow lands cultivable, augmenting water resources, installing solar powered pump sets, marketing value added farm produce, adoption of micro-irrigation and ramping up milk production.The chief minister’s Dry Land Development Mission to increase income of farmers depending on rainfed farming and organic farming development scheme to promote organic farming were also introduced in the budget. Farms under the organic farming scheme will be certified as organic and the necessary inputs would be made available in agricultural extension centres.Tamil Nadu assembly’s budget session commenced on Friday, when finance minister Palanivel Thiagarajan presented the new government’s maiden budget. Among major announcements, the state tax on petrol was was slashed, which led to a reduction in prie by ₹3 per litre. A separate fund was also announced for climate change adaptation and mitigation activities.(With PTI input)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dmk-govt-in-tamil-nadu-fulfills-poll-promise-presents-separate-agri-budget-101628940222492.html

Kingfisher House was once the headquarters of the now defunct Kingfisher Airlines owned by Mallya, who is accused of fraud and money laundering allegedly amounting to around ₹9,000 crore.Saturn Realtors paid ₹2.612 crore as stamp duty to Maharashtra government for this deal. The deal was registered on July 31 last month.This 2401.70 square metres property outside the Mumbai airport has been up for grabs since 2016. The Debt Recovery Tribunal, Bengaluru sold this house-- after failing in the previous eight attempts-- at a fraction of the initial reserve price of ₹135 crore.Pankaj Kapoor, managing director, Liases Foras, a real estate research firm attributed the reduced rates to its location and market condition. “There is not much development potential in this plot due to height restrictions as it is close to the airport. In addition, market conditions are bad...,”said Kapoor.Kingfisher Airlines was grounded on October 20, 2012, after it plunged into a financial crisis. Mallya is accused of fraud and money laundering involving Kingfisher Airlines and was declared a fugitive economic offender for defaulting on loans and for allegedly defrauding banks.Mallya fled to the United Kingdom and has been fighting on multiple fronts to avoid extradition to India. He has been on bail in the UK on an extradition warrant since his arrest in April 2019.Earlier in June, the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court ruled that properties worth ₹5646.54 crores, belonging to Kingfisher Airlines and Vijay Mallya should be restored to State Bank of India (SBI) and its consortium, enabling its sale to recover part of the ₹6203 crores dues owed by Mallya and his now defunct-company.These included properties in UB City, Bengaluru worth ₹712.94 crore, under construction flats in Kingfisher tower worth ₹564.25 crores, several pledged and unpledged shares and many other properties owned by Dr Mallya through various companies in Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijay-mallya-s-kingfisher-house-sold-for-rs-52-25-crore-in-ninth-attempt-101628938017346.html

14-08-2021||India||3 opposition lawmakers refused to preside over House proceedings in protest||As Opposition lawmakers trooped daily into the Well of the House during Parliament's Monsoon Session, shouted slogans, and carried placards in the Rajya Sabha over Pegasus snooping controversy, farm laws, and the price rise, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) lawmaker Vandana Chavan and two of her colleagues chose to protest in her own way. They refused to chair the House proceedings and stood by their colleagues in the Opposition.Both Houses of Parliament have 12 presiding officers to run them in the absence of the Rajya Sabha chairman or deputy chairman and the Lok Sabha Speaker.Congress lawmaker L Hanumanthaiah and Trinamool Congress (TMC)'s Sukhendu Sekhar Ray also refused to be presiding officers--a role that would have entailed asking opposition lawmakers to stop protests and return to their seats."It was not morally the right thing to do. I cannot protest and also go and officiate," said Chavan.Hanumanthaiah and Chavan met deputy chairman Harivansh to explain their position."Harivansh understood (their position) and said he hoped things would function normally soon and we could resume duties," said Chavan.The Monsoon Session of Parliament came to a premature end on Wednesday when it was adjourned ahead of schedule. Protests by a united Opposition and repeated disruptions marred the session even as the government pushed key laws.TMC's floor leader, Derek O'Brien, maintained his party colleague Ray showed "outstanding commitment to the Opposition's cause.""Being a senior member, he was one of the obvious choices to run the House. But he refused," said O'Brien.Biju Janata Dal's Bhartruhari Mahtab, one of the 12 presiding officers in Lok Sabha, maintained that one cannot find fault in the decision of the three leaders. "It is the prerogative of a member to decide whether he or she wants to sit in the chair and run the House in the chairman's absence. They cannot be forced to preside," said Mahtab.After a new government comes in, both Houses ask different parties if they want to nominate a member as presiding officer. "Usually, the presiding officers inform beforehand when they are available to sit in the chair. If anyone is not interested, he or she can simply inform that he is not available," said Mahtab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-opposition-lawmakers-refused-to-preside-over-house-proceedings-in-protest-101628933035528.html

Children above 3 years of age must wear masks at all times while they are in open areas or playing in the parks of housing societies. The fresh guidelines, issued by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike in the wake of a small rise in the number of Covid cases in Karnataka and Bengaluru, are aimed at keeping a check on the situation in apartments as 50 per cent of the city's containment zones are apartment complexes.While negative RT-PCR is mandatory to enter Karnataka for travellers from Kerala, the new guideline says the resident welfare associations must check for negative RT-PCR tests for apartment residents coming from any other state. If they do not have one, then they will have to undergo the test and until the results come, they will have to remain in home quarantine.Also Read | Around 250 cases in 5 days: Bengaluru sees spike of Covid cases among youth, childrenResidents with pets are allowed to walk them in the open space but following Covid norms. Gymnasiums of complexes will operate at 50 per cent capacity, the new rule said. Community halls, clubhouses and other common closed places in societies will remain closed. Courier and delivery services will not be allowed inside the complexes while emergency and necessary services such as medical, plumbing, electrical, cooking gas, water supply etc will be allowed, the directive said.Bengaluru on Friday reported 425 fresh infections and five deaths. The city has been seeing a steady increase in the number of Covid infections since the last week of July. The number of patients between the age of 0 to 19 years has become a cause of concern as it is believed that children will be more susceptible to a possible Covid third wave. But BBMP officials said the surge is not huge in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rtpcr-for-travellers-masks-for-children-above-3-must-in-bengaluru-societies-101628932307382.html
14-08-2021||India||20 ITBP personnel who fought Chinese troops in Ladakh get gallantry medals||Twenty Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) personnel, who fought shoulder-to-shoulder with the Army in keeping the Chinese troops at bay in Eastern Ladakh's Galwan Valley and Gogra Hot Springs during clashes along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) last year, have been awarded gallantry medals ahead of the 75th Independence Day on Sunday.In all, 630 security personnel, including 257 from the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) Police, have been awarded medals for their bravery, the Union home ministry said on Saturday. The gallantry medals to J&K Police personnel have been awarded for counterterrorism and security/law and order-related operations. As many as 152 medals have been awarded to Central Reserve Police Force personnel involved in counterinsurgency and anti-Naxal operations across the country.Overall, 1,320 police personnel across the country have been awarded gallantry, distinguished services, and meritorious services medals.ITBP spokesman Vivek Pandey said ITBP has got 23 gallantry medals, out of which 20 have been awarded for bravery during Eastern Ladakh skirmishes in May-June 2020.“This is the highest number of gallantry medals for ITBP for the bravery of its men in border face-off/skirmishes/border guarding duties,” Pandey said.The Galwan Valley clash of June 15, 2020, was the deadliest between Indian and Chinese troops along the LAC in more than five decades and pushed the bilateral relationship to a breakpoint. It left 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops dead.Pandey said out of 20 jawans/officers awarded for gallantry in Eastern Ladakh, eight have been decorated for their gallant acts, meticulous planning, and tactical insightfulness and for defending the country in Galwan on June 15, 2020. “Six personnel have been awarded police medal for gallantry for their bravery during violent face off on May 18, 2020, in Finger IV area while six personnel have awarded for their gallant action near Hot Springs in Ladakh on May 18, 2020."The decorated officers of ITBP include Kishor Singh Bisht (Commandant) Rinku Thapa (2nd In Command) Sarat Kumar Tripathi (Deputy Commandant) and Arbind Kumar Mahato, Akshay Ahuja, Pankaj Srivastava, and Dharmendra Kumar Vishwakarma (Assistant Commandants).“In eastern Ladakh, the ITBP troops not only effectively used shields to protect themselves but also responded fiercely to PLA (People's Liberation Army)'s advancing troops and brought the situation under control during fierce face-offs and skirmishes. With the highest order of professional skills, ITBP troops fought shoulder to shoulder and also brought the injured troops to the rear,” Pandey said.“Even when the ITBP troops fought the whole night, they received minimum casualties by giving befitting reply to the stone pelters of the PLA. At places, they gave determined responses for about 17 to 20 hours throughout the intervening night in extremely challenging conditions."Pandey said due to the high-altitude training and survival experience of the force in the Himalayan deployments at the icy heights, the ITBP troops kept the PLA troops at bay. He added due to the befitting response of ITBP troops at several fronts, many areas were safeguarded.“The ITBP troops showed the highest level of devotion, courage, determination, utter disregard to personal safety even in injured condition and exhibited great professional skills in the face of the violent physical scuffle with the PLA,” Pandey said.In September last year, 300 ITBP personnel were awarded Director General’s Commendation Roll and insignias for bravery by SS Deswal, the head of the force, in Eastern Ladakh.Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) joint director Manoj Shashidhar, who heads the agency’s key Anti-Corruption Headquarters unit, has been awarded President’s Police Medal for distinguished service.A 1994 batch Gujarat cadre Indian Police Service officer, Shashidhar has been posted with the agency since January last year. Shashidhar is supervising probes into the AgustaWestland scam, Bollywood actor Sushant Singh’s death as well as corruption case against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. He is among six CBI personnel, who have been awarded medals for distinguished service. Twenty-four other CBI officers have been decorated for meritorious service.Inspector Neeraj Sharma of the National Investigation Agency’s Jammu branch, who was part of the team that cracked the 2019 Pulwama attack, has also been awarded the medal for meritorious service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/20-itbp-personnel-who-fought-chinese-troops-in-ladakh-get-gallantry-medals-101628930148774.html

Pakistan celebrates August 14 as its Independence Day.“Partition's pains can never be forgotten. Millions of our sisters and brothers were displaced and many lost their lives due to mindless hate and violence. In memory of the struggles and sacrifices of our people, 14th August will be observed as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day," Modi tweeted.In a subsequent tweet, he said lessons should be drawn from the violence that erupted during Partition to further enhance harmony and human empowerment. “May the #PartitionHorrorsRemembranceDay keep reminding us of the need to remove the poison of social divisions, disharmony and further strengthen the spirit of oneness, social harmony and human empowerment."Commenting on the decision to observe August 14 as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day, Vijay Chauthaiwale, in charge of the foreign affairs department of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said it is time to acknowledge the horrors of Partition and the violence that ensued after India and Pakistan were carved out as two countries in 1947.“This is a long-overdue recognition that Partition resulted in violence, displacement of millions of people, incidents of killing and rape of those who came from the present-day Pakistan. The stories are still vivid and observing this day is a recognition of their sacrifices. Partition was a tragic part of history and the violence that followed it as well. PM Modi has shown tremendous courage by acknowledging the same,” Chauthaiwale said.The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological mentor of the BJP, has been observing August 14 as the Akhand Bharat Divas or Unified India Day. On several occasions, its top leaders have made a case for the reunification of Akhand Bharat, including parts that got separated from India such as Afghanistan and Pakistan but not through coercion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-says-august-14-will-be-observed-as-partition-horrors-remembrance-day-101628927370700.html
14-08-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi's Twitter handle unlocked||Twitter on Saturday unlocked accounts of Rahul Gandhi and those linked to the Congress days after nearly 5,000 handles associated with the party were temporarily blocked for sharing a photograph of the parents of an alleged rape victim. This came after Gandhi submitted a consent letter to Twitter from the parents, authorising him to use the image.Gandhi’s Twitter handle was locked after he tweeted their image on August 4. Twitter said Gandhi's tweet that carried the photo will remain withheld in India.Vipin Yadav, the national coordinator of the Congress' social media department, said almost all the party handles have been unlocked. He added some handles of national coordinators remain locked.Yadav said Congress on day one gave the consent letter to Twitter, but it was not entertained. "Following this, we started a massive campaign on Twitter against the ban on Congress accounts," he said. He said the public pressure forced Twitter to acknowledge the letter and unlock the accounts.Minutes after unlocking, the Congress main's handle tweeted “Satyamev Jayate” which means that truth alone triumphs.A spokesperson for Twitter said as part of the appeal process, Gandhi submitted a copy of the formal consent/authorisation letter to use the referenced image via its India Grievance Channel. "… and based on the written consent provided by the people depicted in the image, our teams initiated the necessary due diligence... the process to review… We have updated our enforcement action based on the consent provided by the people depicted in the image… and the account access has been restored.'The spokesperson added the tweet in which Gandhi shared pictures of the family shall be “withheld in India” and will be invisible to users in the country.“As explained in our Country Withheld Policy, it may be necessary to withhold access to certain content in accordance with valid legal provisions under the Indian law(s). The withholding actions are limited to the specific jurisdiction/country where the content is determined to be unlawful and remains available elsewhere,” the spokesperson said.Gandhi on Friday accused Twitter of being “a biased platform” that “listens to what the government says”. He called the restrictions on his and his party colleagues’ accounts an interference with India’s political process.The girl's mother told journalists on Friday that they have no objection about Gandhi tweeting their image. She said whatever Gandhi did was in good faith.Gandhi's Twitter handle was locked after the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights filed a complaint citing violation of the law, which prohibits the identification of victims of sexual crimes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-s-twitter-handle-unlocked-101628927052122.html

14-08-2021||India||Twitter restores Rahul Gandhi's account, a week after locking it||Twitter on Saturday said it has restored access to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's account, a week after the social media platform temporarily locked it. According to Twitter, the account was locked after the Congress leader ‘violated' its rules by posting pictures of the family of a nine-year-old victim of alleged rape and murder in Delhi.However, even though the account has been restored, the tweet in question was withheld in India, Twitter said. “As explained in our country withheld policy, it may be necessary to withhold access to certain content in accordance with valid legal provisions under the Indian law(s),” a company spokesperson explained, adding that the withholding actions are limited to the specific jurisdiction of the country where the content is determined to be unlawful but remains available elsewhere.Also Read | Twitter is attacking democracy, interfering in political process: Rahul GandhiTwitter accounts of other Congress leaders, who shared the same photographs, have also been restored, said Rohan Gupta, the head of Congress' social media department. He called it a “win for the people of India”.According to a Twitter spokesperson, the accounts were restored as the company received formal consent letters from the individuals depicted in the photos that were shared.“As part of the appeal process, Rahul Gandhi has submitted a copy of the formal consent and authorisation letter to use the referenced image via our India grievance channel,” the spokesperson for Twitter said. “We have followed the necessary due diligence process to review the appeal in order to protect the safety and privacy of the affected individuals. We have updated our enforcement action based on the consent provided by the people depicted in the image.”The development comes a day after Rahul Gandhi made a video statement from his official YouTube channel, titled “Twitter's Dangerous Game”. Accusing Twitter of being a “biased platform”, he said that the social media network is interfering in India's political process. “I have some 19 to 20 million followers, you are denying them the right to an opinion,” Gandhi had said. “It is not only patently unfair but also breaching the idea that Twitter is a neutral platform.”Twitter temporarily locked several Congress leaders out of their accounts a week ago for sharing a photograph of the family of the nine-year-old rape victim in Delhi. Accounts of Randeep Singh Surjewala, Ajay Maken, Sushmita Dev, and Manickam Tagore were among those temporarily locked, Congress functionaries aware of the matter said.Twitter, however, insists that the accounts of the Congress leaders were locked because the image was posted in violation of its rules, which are enforced “judicially and impartially”.Also Read | Cong handles locking row: Twitter says rules enforced judiciously, impartiallySpeaking on the matter, a Twitter spokesperson told Hindustan Times that “certain types of private information carry higher risks than others”. It was the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), it said, which alerted the company about the specific content on the platform allegedly revealing the identity of the alleged sexual assault victim and her parents. The company added the matter was reviewed in line with Twitter rules as well as the concerns expressed as per Indian law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-restores-rahul-gandhi-s-account-a-week-after-locking-it-101628921492325.html
14-08-2021||India||Meghalaya: Top insurgent killed in police encounter; outfit swears vengeance||One of the founders of Meghalaya’s proscribed insurgent outfit Hynñiewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC), which claims to fight for the Khasi-Jaintia tribal community against the outsiders from the Indian mainland, died when his home in Shillong was raided by police early on Friday, police said. However, Cheristerfield Thangkhiew’s family alleged that he was killed in cold blood by the police.Meghalaya director general of police (DGP) R Chandranathan said on Friday evening that there was enough evidence to link the former HNLC leader to the two recent improvised explosive device (IED) blasts claimed by the outfit. “We found incontrovertible evidence of the involvement of Cheristerfield Thangkhiew, especially in the Khliehriat bomb blast case, and we also found his links to the Shillong blast case,” he said.The last such blast suspected to be triggered by HNLC injured two people at Laitumkhrah on Tuesday. Earlier in July, HNLC cadres triggered another blast at the barracks of a special police team at the Police Reserve in East Jaiñtia Hills district headquarters, injuring a policeman and damaging a building partially.The police chief said that when the joint team led by East Jaiñtia Hills police chief Jagpal Singh Dhanoa and East Khasi Hills SP (superintendent of police) (Traffic) Shailendra Bamaniya entered Thangkhiew’s house, he resisted the police. “In the melee, he tried to stab one of the constables. Purely exerting the right of defence, one round was fired. Cheristerfield Thangkhiew was injured in his abdomen [and] he unfortunately succumbed to his injuries at the hospital,” Chandranathan claimed.Police claim to have seized a 9 mm pistol, one knife, a laptop and a number of mobile phones and incriminating documents from the house of the former insurgent leader. The DGP also stated that the police had also picked up Thangkhiew’s two sons for verification. “We have to ascertain their role also,” he said, clarifying that they were not under arrest and were taken to the Civil Hospital in Shillong for medical check up.Thangkhiew’s brother Granary Starfield Thangkhiew said it all happened in a flash. “It is amply clear that they (police) came with the intention to kill and nothing else. Found a gun, no way, no way. It is clear by this action they came with one and only one mission, to kill my dear brother.”“They could have come in the daytime like any other normal person or even summoned him to the police station; why early at 3am when the whole world is fast asleep? They (police) just wanted to show strength like cowards, shame on them,” he continuedIn an emailed communiqué, HNLC general secretary cum spokesperson, Saińkupar Nongtraw said Thangkhiew was involved in talks and mediation between the Central agencies and the banned outfit.“The correspondences which we sent to the IB and SB were all through Thangkhiew,” Nongthraw said and added that Thangkhiew was threatened by surrendered HNLC cadres, Herman Pakyntein and Treng Saw. “In fact the duo planned the killing of the former general secretary in active connivance with the police,” Nongtraw alleged.Nongtraw also alleged that the operation against Thangkhiew couldn’t have been carried out without approval from a senior minister in the Meghalaya government.“Without his permission, this wouldn’t have happened to a person. We will see how long he remains in that chair,” the rebel leader threatened.54-year-old Thangkhiew was known to be one of the most dreaded militant leaders and was the founding general secretary of the HNLC (in August 1987) along with chairman Julius Dorphang, who surrendered on July 24, 2007 and Bobby Marwein as the commander-in-chief. Thangkhiew had surrendered before Meghalaya deputy CM Prestone Tynsong at Shillong in October 18, 2018 and maintained a low profile since then.Known to be close to Nagaland's NSCN (IM) and Tripura's NLFT, the HNLC is a product of a 1992 split in the Hynniewtrep Achik Liberation Council (HALC), the first militant tribal outfit in Meghalaya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meghalaya-top-insurgent-killed-in-police-encounter-outfit-swears-vengeance-101628922001699.html
14-08-2021||India||If your name is Neeraj, you’re up for goodies!||What’s in a name? Well, if you are named Neeraj, then there’s certainly a lot you got in thy name! Free chhole bhature, or ice cream, or even free fuel is actually on offer if you are the one who shares your name with ace javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra. In fact, some of these deals or goodies can also be claimed if you share a common surname with the Olympic gold medallist. Cool... right? Eateries and restaurants across India are cashing in on the recent popularity of the Olympic champion, by serving free meals and discounts to anyone who is a namesake of Chopra, who recently became the first Indian athlete to win a gold medal in track and field event at the Tokyo Games. Take for instance, Sita Ram Diwan Chand, a Paharganj-based eatery in Delhi, which is famous for its Chhole Bhature! To celebrate the victory of Chopra at the world level, this place is offered free Chhole Bhature, on August 13, to anybody named Neeraj! And since then, their phones haven’t stopped ringing. “Ever since we posted this offer on our social media handles, we’ve been getting so many enquiries from anyone and everyone who is named Neeraj. People are simply loving the offer, and planning to come over with their families!” says a manager from the food outlet. Dilli ke Chhole Bhature have a tough competition with Maharashtra-based SavlaHari Pot Ice Cream & Mastani, which is offering free ice cream to anyone named Neeraj Chopra! There’s also an offer of 50% discount, which can be availed by those named Neeraj or with the surname Chopra. “Hey Neeraj, don’t forget to bring your Aadhar card,” says Kavan Patel, from an Ahmedabad-based fast food restaurant, which is offering Chinese food and a pizza meal for all the Neerajs! Patel adds, “The whole country is celebrating and we wanted to as well. Our offer it on till August 15. People are thrilled with this offer! Itna rush hai; sab apne friends ko saath leke rahe hain, aur phir social media pe bhi share kar rahe hain.” And then there’s Countryside Meadows restaurant based in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. It’s offering 50% discount on food to everyone named Neeraj. Pushkar Sharma, from the restaurant, says, “Our social media team came up with this idea. Neeraj Chopra has won the gold medal for our country. Us khushi mein whoever is named Neeraj, we are giving them a 50% discount on food! We were earlier giving offers on only Wednesdays, but then so many people by the name of Neeraj have come forward that we expanded the offer to more days... Yeh jeet, humare desh ke liye garv ki baat hai, and we are doing this to celebrate that expression of pride and joy.”Not just food, there are other offers as well, for those named Neeraj! Like a gas station in Bharuch, Gujarat has found a unique way to honour the athlete, by offering free fuel up to ₹501 for people sharing their name with the golden boy! This offer has been availed by 28 people so far, on showing their identity proof, and were also felicitated with bouquets. Also part of this list is Girnar Ropeway service in Junagadh, which has announced free ropeway rides for people named Neeraj, till August 20. Are you Neeraj, too?

While the navy cancelled the event, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said his government will deal with “anti-India” activities with an iron fist.The navy said that the event, now cancelled, was part of the ministry of defence’s initiative to unfurl the national flag in islands across the nation between 13 and 15 Aug, 21 under the 'Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav' celebrations to mark the 75th Independence Day.“...A team from Goa Naval Area visited islands of Goa including Sao Jacinto Island as part of this pan India initiative,” a statement by the navy said, adding, “However, the plan at Jacinto Island had to be cancelled as the same was objected to by the residents. This initiative was taken nationwide to instil a sense of patriotism and celebrate the run up to the 75th year of independence,” the statement said.Earlier, the villagers of the island said they were not opposed to hoisting of the national flag but would rather do it themselves since they feared that the navy or the Central authorities could end up “capturing” their island. Former Goa revenue minister and state Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president José Philip D’Souza said they won’t let the flag hoisting event go ahead.“Navy's officers came here and said they will be holding a flag hoisting ceremony here for Independence Day celebrations. We only wish to state, be it the navy, the government, or any private company, we are not authorising anyone to come here and do this. We are together in this,” D’Souza said.“If it is in their minds, the mind of the navy or the Central government to come here and 'capture' this island, then we will not allow it,” D’Souza added.The São Jacinto Island is around a kilometre in diameter and is home to around 200 people. The rocky island was once home to a lighthouse and contains no agricultural land besides coconut groves. Villagers said they will unfurl the national flag on their own on Independence Day.“Flag hoisting needs to be done on August 15, and we the villagers will do it under the guidance of village elders,” Custodio D’Souza, a resident, said.Meanwhile, Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant accused the islanders of anti-India activities and promised to deal with them with an iron fist."It is unfortunate and shameful that some individuals at St Jacinto Island have objected to the hoisting of the national flag by the Indian Navy on the occasion of India's Independence Day. I condemn this and want to state on record that my government will not tolerate such acts," Sawant tweeted on Saturday."I have requested the Indian Navy to go ahead with their original plan and have assured [them of] full cooperation from Goa Police. These attempts at anti-India activities shall be dealt with an iron fist. It will always be 'Nation First'," Sawant added.Goa has a love-hate relationship with the navy in the state due to a couple of issues including its alleged ‘takeover’ of the Island of Anjediva, off the coast of Karwar, that was once a part of Goa but became off-limits for locals, wishing to pray at the Island’s two churches, after the navy occupied it for strategic reasons. The two historical churches were built by the Portuguese who occupied the island in 1506 and surrendered it in 1961, 48-hours after mainland Goa was surrendered to India.Devotees are especially peeved that they are denied even nominal attendance at the two churches even on the occasion of the religious feasts. The people of Goa, especially those from the southernmost taluka bordering Karnataka, used to religiously make the pilgrimage to the island twice a year to celebrate the feast until 2004.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-island-residents-wary-of-navy-s-flag-hoisting-event-cm-warns-of-action-101628917677077.html

The legislation doesn't intend to stop anyone from consuming beef, but the person who eats so must also respect the religious sentiments of others, the chief minister said.“Data shows that most of the cases of communal tension in Lower Assam in the past few years are related to beef. The provisions of the Bill will lead to communal harmony as it would allow those who consume beef to eat it with some restrictions and also respect the sentiments of non-beef eating communities like Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs,” Himanta Sarma said during his reply on a discussion on the legislation on Friday.Also read | Assam approves bill to regulate cattle slaughter, transport, sale of beefThe Assam Cattle Preservation Bill, 2021, was passed through a voice vote even as opposition members staged a walkout from the House.

14-08-2021||India||Jallianwala Bagh memorial, with names of 492 martyrs on its walls, to be unveiled in Amritsar today||On the eve of Independence Day 2021, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh will on Saturday inaugurate the Jallianwala Bagh massacre centenary memorial in Amritsar. The chief minister is presently on a two-day visit to the holy city and will introduce the memorial commemorating the passage of more than a century since the tragedy which unfolded there on April 13, 1919.The Jallianwala Bagh massacre is a painful reminder for India of all the lives lost during the country's struggle for freedom against British colonial rule. The incident is particularly haunting because it involved a large crowd of peaceful protesters being ruthlessly shot at by armed British soldiers under the command of brigadier-general REH Dyer. According to subsequent inquiry committees probing the firing, at least 1,000 people were killed in Jallianwala Bagh, more than 1,200 were injured and 192 people were reported to have suffered “grave” injuries. The incident went down in history as a “massacre”, implying a sense of wanton murder and indiscriminate killing inflicted upon a defenceless crowd.The Jallianwala Bagh massacre centenary memorial, set to be unveiled in Amritsar by the Punjab chief minister on Saturday, is intended as a mark of respect to all those who were killed at the site over a century ago. The structure has been elevated at Anand Amrit Park in the city's Ranjit Avenue locality.The memorial has been set up over 4,490 square metres at a cost of ₹3.5 crore to serve as a memory of the Jallianwala Bagh martyrs for future generations. The foundation stone was laid by the chief minister in January this year.The Jallianwala Bagh massacre memorial has the names of 492 martyrs engraved on its walls, according to the list available with the Amritsar deputy commissioner’s office. The chief minister, Captain Amarinder Singh, will also honour the martyrs’ families on the occasion.Notably, the Punjab government has been able to trace the family members of only 29 martyrs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jallianwala-bagh-centenary-memorial-names-of-492-martyrs-on-walls-amritsar-today-101628902656121.html
14-08-2021||India||Climate crisis fund, petrol tax cut part of Tamil Nadu budget||The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-led Tamil Nadu government on Friday presented its maiden state budget, announcing a reduction of ₹3 per litre in petrol prices and focusing on school education and climate crisis, even as the Opposition All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) staged a walkout from the legislative assembly.After releasing a White Paper on Monday to show the dire straits of the state’s finances, Tamil Nadu finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan presented a revenue-deficit budget.“This budget lays the foundation for our plans to restore TN’s finances, grow the economy and improve people’s lives. We will stem the decline this year,” Rajan tweeted.One of the highlights of the budget was the announcement of cut in petrol prices by ₹3 a litre, which aims to benefit the working class in the state. “The price cut will come into effect on August 14,” said finance secretary S Krishnan at a press conference.In its election manifesto, the DMK had promised to cut the state tax on petrol by ₹5 per litre. However, it reiterated in the budget that the onus of providing relief to consumers also lies with the Union government. Rajan also announced that Tamil Nadu Climate Change Mission will be launched to focus on climate change adaptation and mitigation activities with a total outlay of ₹500 crore.The DMK government in its budget also announced establishing an expert advisory council to develop a ‘Federal Fiscal Model’ on legislation involving revenue and taxation (including GST). “Nowhere is this dilution of the spirit of federalism more apparent than in the taxation of petrol and diesel at the pump. The overall Union levies on petrol were increased from ₹10.39 per litre in May 2014 to ₹32.90 per litre today,” Rajan said.The government also announced setting up a high-level committee of educationists and experts to formulate a State Education Policy for Tamil Nadu. The DMK has been critical of the Centre’s new National Education Policy. The highest allocation of ₹32,599.5 crore in this budget went to the department of school education with an aim to bring Tamil Nadu among the top three states in terms of learning outcomes in the country. The school education department had seen the highest ₹34,181 crore allocation in 2020-21 as well.The minister said that maternity leave for women employed in the public sector will be increased from 9 to 12 months.Experts have welcomed the announcements made in the budget but added that the roadmap for how revenue would be improved was missing in the minister’s budget speech.“The budget has set an ambitious target of lowering the revenue deficit to ₹58,692 crore, which is lower than the figure in 2019-20 and less than 60% of the revised revenue deficit estimate for 2020-21. It is unclear for now, without knowing the details on the revenue side how this would be achieved,” said Vidya Mahambare, professor of economics, Great Lakes Institute of Management, Chennai.The finance minister said that the most critical reform the government has to undertake is to increase the tax GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) ratio of Tamil Nadu. The White Paper found significant deterioration of the tax GSDP ratio from 8.4% in 2006-07 to 5.46% in the current year. This represents a loss of about Rs.65,000 crore worth of revenue annually.“That’s a huge loss,” says A Kalairasan, assistant professor, Madras Institute of Development Studies and a Fulbright-Nehru scholar at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, Brown University. “The state’s capacity (ratio of tax GSDP is one method to measure it) to intervene in the socio-economic condition of people's lives has been continuously declining. This is alarming in the sense that for any major reform to take place revenue has to come in.” With the minister indicating that major reforms will be brought in during the full budget next year, Kalaiarasan says that the good thing about this budget is the White Paper being tabled ahead so the two can be studied in comparison. “Like how we get the economic survey before the union budget is presented, we now have more clarity and transparency on the status of the state’s economy which we can compare with the government's roadmap,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/climate-crisis-fund-petrol-tax-cut-part-of-tamil-nadu-budget-101628902834017.html
14-08-2021||India||‘Oppn voice wasn’t heard…BJP missing leader like Jaitley': Jairam Ramesh||A day after the Centre accused the Opposition of orchestrating protests to derail proceedings during the recently concluded monsoon session, former Union minister and senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh accused the government of not listening to the Opposition’s demands of holding discussions on key issues.Edited excerpts:Union ministers said on Thursday that the Opposition must apologise.Apologise for what? Is the government willing to apologise for not fulfilling the commitment or malign the Rajya Sabha and turn it into a war like zone? Why should we apologise? They said it was our compulsion to support the 127th Constitution amendment bill. I would say, it was their compulsion to nullify the Supreme Court order. Opposition voice was never heard. We also found the chair partisan. I’ve seen Bhairon Singh Shekhawat in the chair. He managed such situations in a far better way.The BJP’s basic problem is absence of Arun Jaitley. What he said, he delivered. They are feeling the absence of man of his seniority and gravitas.The BJP is blaming the Opposition for continuous disruptions and ruckus in the House.The same BJP engineered a complete washout in 2010. The current chairman was a front row member that time. They masterminded the washout of the winter session and half the monsoon session in 2010. BJP leader late Arun Jaitley had said, disruption is a legitimate instrument fort the Opposition. We wanted to debate, not agitate and protest. But who can agree to have bills passed in the din?The government said the Opposition pre-planned disruption as they were not interested in running Parliament.We wanted the House to run. In fact, I am accused by some Opposition leaders for trying to run the House. But Pegasus was a serious issue, and it agitated us. On July 22, we said first and foremost discussion on Pegasus in the presence of PM and HM, and a probe by a Supreme Court-appointed committee. We dropped the second demand and only sought a reply from HM. It’s bizarre to have IT minister give a bland, meaningless statement. We also said insurance bill is deeply problematic and so refer it to a parliamentary committee. In fact, Leader of the House Piyush Goyal told me, “The government is in no hurry to pass the bill.”Congress leader Rahul Gandhi got very active. He attended 3 Opposition meetings, chaired a breakfast meeting…There is no competition for the opposition space. We have to first consolidate this unity. Opposition has to work on four pillars. The Maharashtra pillar is parties averse to each other can come together to form a non-BJP government. The second is the Tamil Nadu pillar, which stands for long-term alliances like the one between the Congress and DMK. The third is the Bengal pillar, where a very strong regional party and takes on the BJP as Mamata Banerjee has done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-voice-wasn-t-heard-bjp-missing-leader-like-jaitley-jairam-ramesh-101628899531407.html
14-08-2021||India||Erratic rains throw sowing schedules off for farmers||Erratic rainfall this summer, believed to be linked to climate change, upended sowing patterns in many states, keeping farmers on tenterhooks as rains tapered off around the end of June before reviving in late July, several cultivators have said.Even after accelerating towards mid-July, the monsoon rains were 7% deficient on August 13 for the season as a whole.Some farmers, especially in Gujarat, said the lack of rains for a considerable period meant growers were pushed into a guessing game on what to sow. Another in Haryana said he expected poorer yields from cotton. A third farmer in Madhya Pradesh said he had nearly given up on his soya crop until the rains revived.The June-September monsoon, which waters nearly 60% of the country’s net-sown area, had stalled towards June-end and then dumped excess rainfall after reviving in mid-July in a pattern scientists say is consistent with a changing climate.According to climatologists, longer dry spell and short spurts of heavy rainfall are tell-tale signs of a changing monsoon owing to the impacts of a warming planet. The India Meteorological Department has forecast a normal monsoon for 2021.The monsoon has been quite uneven, data from the IMD shows. Gujarat, which accounts for 40% and 20% of groundnut and cotton acreage, has faced a cumulative rainfall deficit of 43%.“With Indian agriculture largely rainfall-dependent, the now-on, now-off monsoon this year has shifted the sowing from much-expected oilseeds (groundnut and soybean) to maize and paddy for kharif,” said Hetal Gandhi, director of Crisil Research Ltd.According to reports, the shortfall from June 1 to August 8 prompted Gujarat farmers to shift from groundnut and cotton to castor, a hardier crop that can withstand dry weather. “We were guessing all the time. After sowing a crop and spending so much, you can’t invest again to replace it. So, ultimately many in our village decided to sow castor instead of groundnut,” Chabil Patel, a potato and groundnut farmer in Sabarkantha, said over the phone. To the east in Odisha, cumulative rainfall deficit has been around 8%. The state accounts for 8% of the country’s total paddy acreage.While northeastern states such as Assam faced a drought in the paddy and tea growing belt, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Haryana received excessive rainfall. East Rajasthan and north Madhya Pradesh were deluged by a violent surge in the monsoon. “I am not very confident of what my yields will be,” said soy grower Ravikant Moria, a farmer in Mandsaur, Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/erratic-rains-throw-sowing-schedules-off-for-farmers-101628881867413.html
14-08-2021||India||4 teenagers detained in MP’s Morena for hacking ECI website, creating fake voter IDs||The Madhya Pradesh police detained four teenagers from Morena to nab an 18-year-old accused in connection with an alleged compromise of the Election Commission of India’s website and creating fake voter IDs, said a police officer. The Election Commission, however, said that its website has not been hacked. The police in Uttar Pradesh on Thursday arrested Vipul Saini, 24, for allegedly creating hundreds of fake voter IDs. Saini had created more than 10,000 fake voter IDs over a time span of three months, at the behest of a person named Armaan Malik, a resident of Harda, Madhya Pradesh. UP police informed MP police about the involvement of 18-year-old Hariom Singh, a resident of Ambah, Morena. Police are trying to nab Hariom, son of a daily wage earner. “Hariom Singh was directly in touch with Vipul Saini and used to keep IDs to sell it to others. Police on Friday detained four teenagers aged between 17 and 19 years who were in contact with Hariom. One of the detainees told the police that they have at least 10 million genuine and fake IDs. They used to sell the data to fraudsters who mainly used the IDs for purchasing SIM cards, opening bank accounts and for committing online fraud,” said a senior police official, who is not authorized to talk to the media. According to the police, these teenagers reportedly claimed that they were working for Hariom and the police are trying to find out details about their bank accounts to find how much money they made. The MP police have also seized their mobile phones to know more about the other gang members, said another officer, who was not willing to be named. All of the detained belong to underprivileged families and are school drop-outs, police said. They became a part of the gang to earn quick money, the officer added. MP police is also trying to get details of Malik. Malik is presently living in New Delhi and seems to be the mastermind of the gang. Saini told the police that Malik used to give him details for creating fake voter IDs. He used to get ₹200 for one voter ID. Police found ₹60 lakh in Saini’s account.MP, director-general of police (DGP), Vivek Johri said, “I can’t share much information as the case is under investigation and we are just helping UP police.” The election commission said that the ECI’s database is safe and secure. In a press communiqué, ECI said Assistant Electoral Roll Officers (AERO) are mandated to provide citizen-centric services including printing of Voter ID cards and timely distribution in line with the theme of “No voter to be left behind”. “Data Entry Operator of one of the AERO offices had illegally shared his user id password with a private unauthorized service provider in Saharanpur’s Nakud town to print some Voter ID cards. Both these persons have been arrested,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-teenagers-detained-in-mp-s-morena-for-hacking-eci-website-creating-fake-voter-ids-101628885575938.html
14-08-2021||India||Climate crisis fund, petrol tax cut part of TN budget||Chennai: The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-led Tamil Nadu government on Friday presented its maiden state budget, announcing a reduction of ₹3 per litre in petrol prices and focusing on school education and climate change, even as the principal opposition All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) staged a walkout from the legislative assembly. After releasing a White Paper on Monday to show the dire straits of the state’s finances, Tamil Nadu finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan presented a revenue-deficit budget without announcing any major reforms. Rajan said given the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the economic situation, it was not the ideal time for fiscal consolidation while adding that the primary aim of the revised estimates, which covers only the next six months, was to lay a foundation for the 2022-23 full budget. An interim budget was presented by the previous AIADMK government in February before the state went for assembly elections on April 6. Rajan presented a three-hour-long budget, which is Tamil Nadu assembly’s first paperless budget, amid walkout from the AIADMK. Legislators sat through the session reading from the computer monitors that were set up for them more than a week ago. The revenue deficit for this year is expected to go up to ₹58,692.6 crore from ₹41,417.3 crore, which Rajan said, was estimated unrealistically in the interim budget. “This increase in revenue deficit is on account of the exceptional times that we find ourselves in and does not detract in the least from this government’s commitment to fiscal rectitude and consolidation in the coming years, as emphatically indicated in the White Paper,” Rajan said. “As soon as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is overcome, deeper reforms will be undertaken to ensure that Tamil Nadu’s debt overhang is corrected without any delay.” According to the White Paper, the projected outstanding debt of the state is likely to be ₹5.7 lakh crore as of March 31, 2022, which effectively means the burden on every resident in the state is around ₹70,000. The fiscal deficit is also estimated to go up to Rs.92,529.4 crore by the end of the current fiscal. One of the highlights of the budget was the announcement of cut in petrol prices by ₹3 a litre, which aims to benefit the working class in the state. Around 26.3 million people in Tamil Nadu use two-wheelers. The price cut will come into effect on August 14, said finance secretary S Krishnan in a post-budget press conference. The price cut will, however, result in a loss of Rs1,160 crore a year in revenue for the state government, the minister said in his budget speech. In its election manifesto, the DMK had promised to cut the state tax on petrol by ₹5 per litre. However, it reiterated in the budget that the onus of providing relief to consumers also lies with the Union government. The DMK government in its budget also announced establishing an expert advisory council to develop a ‘Federal Fiscal Model’ on legislation involving revenue and taxation (including GST). “Nowhere is this dilution of the spirit of federalism more apparent than in the taxation of petrol and diesel at the pump. The overall Union levies on petrol were increased from Rs.10.39 per litre in May 2014 to Rs.32.90 per litre today,” Rajan said. The government also announced setting up a high-level committee of educationists and experts to formulate a State Education Policy for Tamil Nadu. The DMK has been critical of the Centre’s new National Education Policy. The highest allocation of ₹32,599.5 crore in this budget went to the department of school education with an aim to bring Tamil Nadu among the top three states in terms of learning outcomes in the country. The school education department had seen the highest allocation of ₹34,181 in the 2020-2021 budget as well. In the budget speech, Rajan also announced that Tamil Nadu Climate Change Mission will be launched to focus on climate change adaptation and mitigation activities with a total outlay of Rs.500 crore. This year, a bank-linked fund flow of ₹20,000 crore, including a special pandemic loan assistance, will be provided to various Self Help Groups and the third highest allocation of ₹18,9333 crore has been earmarked for the health department. Several disabled-friendly infrastructure projects were also announced in the budget. Subsidies for transgender were also in focus. The White Paper had called for the re-orientation of subsidies, which had alarmingly increased in the state in terms of food, power and transport. Rajan had previously said that even people who are well off were receiving the state’s cash doles and other benefits intended for the poor. While earlier the government did not have data on taxpayers and ration-linked economic status, in this budget, it has indicated moving towards targeted subsidies by announcing that it will link all available government data sources to understand the true economic status of all citizens and households. Rajan said the government was in the process of identifying households eligible for receiving benefits of ₹1,000 to women heads, another poll promise of the DMK. A major initiative for smart metering for all public utilities will be launched to ensure that people pay based on consumption, the minister announced. Meanwhile, experts have welcomed the announcement to meet the drinking water objectives by implementing Jal Jeevan Missions at ₹2,000 crore, creating industrial parks in tier-2 cities and districts and four Tidel (IT) parks in Villupuram, Vellore, Thoothukudi, and Tiruppur districts. They, however, added that the roadmap for how revenue would be improved was missing in the minister’s budget speech. “The budget has set an ambitious target of lowering the revenue deficit to ₹58,692 crore, which is lower than the figure in 2019-20 and less than 60% of the revised revenue deficit estimate for 2020-21.

14-08-2021||India||CM calls for an emergency meet as Covid cases surge||Bengaluru: Even as Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has called for an emergency meeting on Saturday, following the increase in Covid cases in the state, especially among children in Bengaluru, state revenue minister R Ashok said that there is no proposal to impose any lockdown in the capital city. “Curfew is not the solution. People will face problems if we announce any sudden lockdowns. Just like a slow medicine, we will control the spread. The cases are reducing in Bengaluru, so it is not a big concern. The districts which are seeing a rise, we have informed the concerned authorities there to take the required action. I want to make it clear that there is no proposal to implement a complete lockdown Bengaluru,” he told reporters on Friday The chief minister, meanwhile, said that the experts have warned that the children will likely be affected during the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, as they belong to the non-vaccinated group. As a result, the state government has started the ‘Vathsalya’ scheme in Udupi and Haveri districts for complete monitoring of children. “We will organise pediatric health camps to check their nutritious strength, and will do all necessary treatment for lack of nutrition and undergrowth,” Bommai said. “We have provided training to all concerned officers working on the scheme, and will try to protect the children from this virus. All district hospitals have been instructed to arrange pediatric ICU,” he added. Talking about cases among children, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) commissioner Gaurav Gupta on Wednesday had said the city administration is monitoring the numbers closely. “We are closely watching the numbers. So far, we are seeing the same rate of infections this year as in 2020. In case these numbers go up we will take the required steps,” Gupta had said. When asked about the dangers the children are likely to face in the third wave, Gupta said that the authorities are working towards ensuring that all age groups are protected. “It is important to keep children safe from getting infected from other family members who have the chance of coming in contact with other people. So, maintaining the Covid protocols at home is as important,” Gupta added. On Wednesday, HT had reported citing state health bulletin that in the first week of August, Bengaluru reported 499 cases of Covid-19 among children under the age of 19. Among the 499 cases, 263 were reported between August 5 to August 10, and out of these, 88 were between 0 to 9 years and 175 were between 10 and 19 years old. The state reported 1,669 new cases on Friday taking the active caseload to 22,703. Bengaluru accounted for 425 new infections, taking its active cases to 8,189. As many as 22 fatalities were reported across the state on Monday, which took the state’s toll to 36,933. Bengaluru’s toll due to Covid-19 jumped to 15,933, with 5 deaths being reported on Friday according to the state health department. Dakshina Kannada district, which borders Kerala continues to record a higher number of cases with 390 new cases, which is the second-highest number of cases reported in the state. All other districts recorded less than 150 new cases on Friday. Meanwhile, BBMP on Friday issued a standard operating procedure to resident welfare associations across the city to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in apartments. “All residents, house helps, delivery personnel, service providers and visitors need to be checked for temperature, existing symptoms and mask usage at the entry point and provision for hand sanitization/hand wash needs to be made available for use before entering,” read the guidelines. It added that a comprehensive list of all non-residents visiting or accessing the complex with their contact details must be maintained at apartments and if any resident or his/her family members has undertaken interstate travel, it is suggested ensuring they are tested. “All those returning from interstate travel shall carry a recent (not older than 72 hours) RTPCR Negative report and if not they shall undergo RTPCR testing and remain under mandatory home quarantine till the results are declared,” the guideline said. Common Open areas like walkways and parks can be used for walking, jogging, cycling, exercising etc subject to the strict maintenance of Covid appropriate behaviour i.e mask usage and maintenance of social distancing. These places should not get converted into socializing or meeting points. “Gymnasiums and non-contact sports facilities can be utilized at 50% of capacity. Caution shall be observed that these places do not get converted into socialising or meeting points. Swimming Pools however shall remain closed,” read the guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-calls-for-an-emergency-meet-as-covid-cases-surge-101628883359069.html
14-08-2021||India||India rubbishes Pakistan foreign minister’s allegations on attack that killed 9 Chinese nationals||New Delhi: India on Friday rejected the Pakistan foreign minister’s claim that the Indian and Afghan spy agencies were behind a suicide attack on a bus last month that killed nine Chinese nationals, saying it was an attempt to deflect global attention from Pakistan’s “role as the epicentre of regional instability”.Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi contended on Thursday that the bombing was carried out by terrorists backed by the Indian and Afghan intelligence agencies. He claimed an investigation revealed a “nexus of Indian RAW and Afghan NDS” in the attack, referring to the intelligence agencies of the two countries.Qureshi told a news conference that the Pakistani Taliban carried out the attack. “As per our investigation, the Afghan soil was used for this incident...about its planning and its execution, we’re seeing a clear nexus between NDS and RAW,” he added.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi rubbished Qureshi’s allegations and described them as “absurd comments”. He added, “This is yet another attempt by Pakistan to malign India, in a bid to deflect international attention from its role as the epicentre of regional instability and a safe haven for proscribed terrorists.”Bagchi said India has been at the forefront of global efforts against terrorism in partnership with the international community, “which is well aware of Pakistan’s credentials when it comes to terrorism”. He added, “Such desperate attempts by Pakistan at peddling lies and propaganda will therefore find few takers.”The July 14 attack on the bus carrying workers to a hydropower project site at Dasu in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province resulted in the death of nine Chinese nationals and four more people. Pakistani authorities have made several flip-flops on the attack, claiming hours after the blast that it was caused by a mechanical failure that resulted in a gas leak.The Chinese side said immediately after the attack that the bus was hit by a blast. After traces of explosives were found at the site, Pakistani authorities claimed that an attack couldn’t be ruled out. On Thursday, Qureshi said the bus blast was a suicide bombing and that the Chinese side was satisfied with the investigation done by Pakistani authorities. The incident had prompted Chinese Premier Li Keqiang to urge his Pakistani counterpart last month to hold the culprits accountable for what he described as a terrorist attack. Both Qureshi and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief had visited Beijing last month to placate the Chinese side. On Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s investigation into the attack. She reiterated Pakistan’s contention that planning for the attack was done in Afghanistan and it was executed by the Pakistani Taliban. Hua also said: “The terrorist network the attacker is associated with has received support from Indian and Afghan intelligence agencies.”The developments come at a time when India’s relations with Pakistan and China are strained.

14-08-2021||India||India joined exclusive surveillance group after 26/11, says book||India, ignored by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) over Pakistan during America’s “war on terror” and the decades preceding it, became the member of an exclusive surveillance group after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, making it a formidable intelligence force, according to a book by journalists Adrian Levy and Cathy Scott-Clark.The book, “Spy Stories – Inside the Secret World of the RAW and ISI”, releasing this week, says Pakistan’s entropy, despite being enriched with billions of dollars post 9/11, brought the American intelligence community, begrudgingly, to Delhi.In 2008, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), received an invite from US National Security Agency (NSA) to join a regional body known as SSPAC (Signals Intelligence Senior Pacific), which, the book says, was a “step up” for India, which had been trying to gain Washington’s attention for a very long time.The members of this exclusive surveillance group included the so called Five Eyes countries – the US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Britain – and also South Korea, Singapore, and Thailand.The SSPAC is a platform for sharing technical intelligence, and here countries pooled their signals, gathered through eavesdropping, but also built trust and learned new surveillance techniques from the world’s most powerful spy agencies.The book says the RAW finally began breaking through and winning NSA plaudits. “The RAW officers were now ‘read into’ some highly classified reports and introduced to data produced by cutting-edge technology and coding that bored into Islamist hotspots.”To find suspects and describe their associations – panning out to even wider friendship circles – involved pooling colossal amounts of sensitive metadata from an enormous volume of calls and messages in Five Eyes members states and (surreptitiously) beyond.“This meant the sender and recipient details for emails, or the phone numbers someone called from, and to, as well as time stamps for when these messages, emails, and calls were sent and made. All of it would be funnelled into a new reference repository, known as SMAC, or the Sensitive Metadata Analytic Collaboration programme,” the authors write.A significant part of the surveillance was “contact chaining,” a method used by British technical intelligence at GCHQ in Cheltenham, to describe entire networks linked to a single exposed phone. “Analysts examined calls, messages, and emails from one suspect and derived from them lists of others and their associates, building a matrix of association in top-secret projects, code-named CLASP and Prime Time,” the book adds.Subsequently, work on tracking Thuraya satellite phones as well as countering burner phones was developed by agencies. The face of Kashmir’s new wave of militancy, Burhan Wani (Hizbul Mujahideen commander), who was killed by security forces on July 8, 2016, was, in fact, constantly tracked though his Thuraya satellite phone, the book claims.Quoting a RAW defector identified with her nom de guerre Monisha, the writers say that information for 26/11 had also come through SSAPC apart from 18 detailed briefs, with likely targets, numbers of attackers, etc shared by the CIA.However, the ground for SSAPC had been laid in January 2004 itself, when India and the US, under former Secretary of State Condolezza Rice, signed the “Next Steps in Strategic Partnership”, that opened the way for Delhi to receive assistance with its civilian space programmes, high technology trade, missile defence efforts, and civilian nuclear activities.Levy and Scott-Clark write the by-product was bringing the US and Indian militaries closer together, even the intelligence services, much further down the line, creating an alliance that would immediately concern Beijing.“Geopolitical fault lines had made Pakistan a necessity in 2001, but as Islamabad’s economy collapsed and its institutions crumbled, overcome by the terror war, so India began to shine by virtue of not succumbing, emerging as a bulwark to emerging superpower China,” the book says.The writers add that the Congress party walked the country back from war after 26/11 and with its allies, constructed this (intelligence) grid.By 2010, Levy and Scott-Clark write, the grid in Kashmir had become a formidable tool. “A matrix made of every kind of intelligence, compiled by multiple Indian agencies, and refined with US assistance and Israeli hardware and software, and driven by indigenous persistence.”Comparing the intelligence agencies of the South Asian arch-rivals, the book says while ISI was battle-hardened, accomplished in unconventional warfare, tuned in to insurgencies all over the subcontinent, and flush with US dollars and Saudi riyals in the early days, RAW became more tech-savvy, thanks to a burgeoning relationship with the Mossad, and tactical shopping expeditions in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East.“As Langley refused to supply Aabpara (referring to ISI headquarters) with eavesdropping and surveillance equipment, arguing that these would be used against India, the ISI fell behind,” the writers adds.The journalists spoke to the who’s who of India and Pakistan’s counter-terrorism and security structure for the book over the years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-joined-exclusive-surveillance-group-after-26-11-says-book-101628882395619.html
14-08-2021||India||Row over spelling error during Bengal BJP chief’s Parliament protest||Days after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Bengal unit chief Dilip Ghosh staged a protest in the Parliament premises against alleged atrocities on women in Bengal by Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers, some spelling errors in the banner he carried have triggered a row. “Kanyashree chaina, nari samman chai,” (Don’t want Kanyashree, want respect for women), said the small banner printed in Bengali. Ghosh, the Lok Sabha MP from Midnapore, carried it on August 11 while staging a protest near the statue of Mahatma Gandhi alongside eight other MPs from Bengal. While the grammar and composition in the banners carried by the other MPs were correct, the word Kanyashree (the Bengal government’s welfare scheme for girls) was spelt incorrectly. Also, the symbol of a vowel was placed in the wrong direction in two other words. The row started after some people pointed out the errors on the Bengal BJP’s social media page. To avoid a controversy, Ghosh told the media that the error was made by Hindi-speaking people in Delhi where the banners were printed. “They could not write the words correctly,” he said. “It is good in a way. The errors drew the attention of the media to the real issue,” he added. A critic of Ghosh, senior BJP leader and former governor of Meghalaya and Tripura, Tathagata Roy, took a potshot on Twitter on Thursday, 48 hours after the incident. “This is why Vidyasagar said there is no end to mistakes fools make. I am talking of the one who printed the poster,” Roy wrote and posted a photograph of Ghosh holding the banner. Since 19th century social reformer and educator Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar is recognized as the father of the modern Bengali alphabet and typeface, Roy’s comment was picked up by political leaders and people active on social media. Congress leader Kaustav Bagchi on Thursday e-mailed a scanned copy of Barnaparichay --- the booklet on Bengali alphabet and prose that Vidyasagar printed for students --- to Ghosh. “A hard copy of the same shall also be sent to you via speed post tomorrow,” Bagchi wrote. Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders did not spare Ghosh. “What more can one expect from him?” quipped senior TMC legislator Tapas Roy. This is not the first time Ghosh has landed in a controversy of this nature. In November 2019, Ghosh made headlines when he said in public that milk from Indian cows contain gold and consumption of this milk can make one immune to all diseases. “Indian cows have a hump. Foreign cows don’t have that. This hump has a special nerve. Gold is created when sunlight falls on this nerve. That is why the milk is yellowish or golden. This milk is a great antidote. One can survive by having only this milk. It is a complete meal,” Ghosh said while addressing a programme in Bengal’s Burdwan district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-spelling-error-during-bengal-bjp-chief-s-parliament-protest-101628881795560.html
14-08-2021||India||Mixing shots a bad idea; India may not meet Dec 31 target: SII founder||The Serum Institute of India is unlikely to be able to secure a license for its version of the highly efficacious coronavirus vaccine developed by US-based company Novavax, the Pune-based vaccine maker’s chairman said on Friday, when he also urged caution on mixing of doses, said booster shots may be needed for those vaccinated over six months ago, and that the expectation that all Indians will be vaccinated by the end of 2021 was unlikely to be achieved.Cyrus Poonawalla, 80, who founded SII – now the world’s largest vaccine maker by volume – was speaking at an event in Pune, where he credited the Centre for easing regulatory processes for vaccine makers at a difficult time. He, however, stressed that the ideal gap between two doses of Covishield, which his company makes, was two months, and criticised the government for banning the export of doses.On the vaccination target to reach all Indians by 2021, Poonawalla said: ”We are yet to increase our production to 10 crore (100 million) vaccines. No single company in the world can produce 10 crore vaccines in a month. We have promised about 110-120 crore doses annually because we invested in it prior. So you can do the math now. If other manufacturers produce 1-2 crores every month then the production would increase accordingly.”The SII founder also said it was a “bad move by the government” to embargo exports of vaccines. “My son (SII CEO Adar Poonawalla) asked me not to open my mouth. But it is my view that exports ought to be opened,” Poonawalla said, citing SII’s supply commitments. Over 150 countries are dependent on SII for vaccines and are blaming the company for stopping the supply during a crucial period, he said, before adding that these countries have paid “crores” in advances. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and World Health Organisation (WHO) have given it ₹5,000 crore which, Poonawalla said, he offered to return. He hinted that they declined his offer in the hope that the Indian government will lift the ban soon.India banned vaccine exports in April when the second wave of the pandemic began to peak and the need to vaccinate people in the country at a greater pace was felt acutely.Poonawalla, however, credited the Centre for easing regulatory processes. “I must stress that my difficulties are much reduced under the Modi government. Definitely, I am not the one to give lip sympathy to government ministers but certainly, one of the major reasons why we could launch our Covid vaccine so quickly was because of the forthcoming grant of permissions, encouragement to industries and reduction of ‘Licencing Raj’. We have now got a drug controller who responds in the evening hours,” Poonawalla said. SII-manufactured Covishield accounts for close to 90% of all coronavirus vaccine doses administered in India. In mid-July, the Union government announced that it had placed orders for 375 million doses of Covishield at a rate of ₹205 per dose. These doses will be supplied between August and December. The Union government recently told parliament that the company will produce 150 million doses a month beginning next month.On when the Novavax vaccine, to be marketed as Covavax in India, can be launched by SII, Poonawalla said: “Novavax is a very good product, however, unless we get the licence to launch it we cannot do so. The American parent company has got some issues with the US FDA which should be cleared by the end of year. Once they get the licence, we will get the licence. We will also try to get it approved before the parent company if possible.” The SII chairman also said that mixing of vaccine doses may lead to a blame game if the results are not idea. “If cocktail vaccines are administered and if the result is not good, then SII may say that another vaccine was not good, vice versa, the other company might say that since you mixed Serum’s vaccine, it did not give desired results,” Poonawalla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mixing-shots-a-bad-idea-india-may-not-meet-dec-31-target-sii-founder-101628880894764.html
14-08-2021||India||V-P Naidu consults experts on action against MPs||Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu is seeking legal consultation on possible action that can be taken against Opposition MPs who allegedly disrupted House proceedings, damaged property, and manhandled marshals on the last day of Parliament’s monsoon session.During an informal discussion, Naidu said he felt that the any verbal attack on the chair — a new development amid the sharpening battle between the BJP and the Opposition — is targeted to “weaken the democratic structure”. The Rajya Sabha secretariat has reported to Naidu that some Opposition leaders “threatened” deputy chairman Harivansh and even used “abusive language”.For the first time in the recent history of Parliament, some Opposition leaders made political comments targeting the impartial role of the chair.A top functionary said that it was deliberately done as the chair can’t compromise the gravitas of the position to retort or reply to the accusations. “Naidu was so upset that he couldn’t sleep on the night of August 10. He even had to consult a doctor,” said an aide.According to a person aware of the details, Naidu’s office is looking at precedents of punitive action for violation of rules and code of conduct. His office has also started consulting former secretary general VK Agnihotri and other experts before arriving at a decision.The secretariat clarified that steps can be taken against a member even after the session is over. “The monsoon session might have ended, but the lawmaker continues to be a member of the House,” said top functionary.“There are instances when MPs were suspended for violations in the past. However, this is the first time that marshals have been attacked…,” said the functionary cited above. Naidu, however, is personally averse to taking the extreme step of suspending a member for the remaining part of the latter’s term in the House.On Thursday, the Opposition had rejected the Rajya Sabha report and blamed the government for the unruly scenes in the House, which, they said, were sparked by “outsiders” acting as marshals. They also claimed that two women members were manhandled.They said the government stonewalled their requests for a debate on the Pegasus row, farm issues and price rise, rushed bills through the House without debate, and muzzled their voice.The government, meanwhile, requested Naidu to take exemplary action against lawmakers who were seen climbing tables in the Upper House, ripping papers, throwing the rule book and damaging property.Referring to the stalemate and the disruptions during an informal interaction with the media on Friday, Naidu said, “Outside political battles should not be fought on the table of the House.”A day after the Opposition alleged that the chair had not allowed discussions on issues raised by them, Naidu said he has been impartial towards both the government and the Opposition. “The government and the Opposition are like two eyes; I treat them both equally,” he said.While a section of the Opposition alleged that Union ministers had assured them that the general insurance amendment bill would be sent to a panel but later went back on the promise, the Rajya Sabha secretariat pointed out that so such assurance was given during any meeting presided by Naidu or in the House.Based on complaints filed by at least two marshals, listing the injuries they sustained while trying to restrain the lawmakers who had trooped into the well of the House, the government asked the chair to set up a committee to examine the incidents and suggest strict action.On Thursday, Union minister and Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha, Piyush Goyal, said, “We (a group of ministers) met the chairperson and the deputy chair, and made an earnest appeal for strongest action against the deplorable misconduct, physical manhandling of staff,” referring to incidents on the last day of the session.Later, Opposition members complained that unprecedented security, including from outside Parliament was deployed in the House which escalated the deadlock between the two sides.Countering the government charge, Trinamool Congress leader Derek O’Brien said, “Chairman is an honourable man. But his actions were not honourable.”On the charge that the chair did not agree to the demand to send bills to select committees for scrutiny, Naidu said the decision to do so rests with the government and the House.“Whenever differences persist on such matters in the House, the House collectively takes a decision and the chair cannot force it one way or the other,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vp-consults-experts-on-action-against-mps-101628879098179.html
14-08-2021||India||Ready for all contingencies in Afghanistan, says India||India is prepared for all contingencies in Afghanistan, including the rapid evacuation of its officials and nationals, against the backdrop of a Taliban blitz over the past week that has seen the capture of five provincial capitals since Thursday.Elaborate plans have been prepared for the speedy withdrawal of diplomats from the embassy in Kabul and a dwindling number of Indian nationals, most of them workers engaged in development projects in Afghanistan, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. These plans include putting heavy lift aircraft of the Indian Air Force on standby round the clock, the people said.These efforts have gained urgency following reports that the US is deploying 3,000 troops to Kabul and the UK sending 600 troops to provide security for the evacuation of nationals of the two countries. India has also received requests from several international organisations, among them media outlets and rights organisations, seeking help for the possible evacuation of their personnel from Afghanistan, the people cited above said.According to information provided by the government in Parliament last week, there were 1,500 Indian nationals in Afghanistan. The people said this figure had now come down to few hundreds, including diplomats and the large security contingent at the embassy in Kabul.Another concern for Indian authorities were Indian nationals who haven’t heeded the latest security advisories calling on them to immediately return home. The latest alert issued by the Indian mission on Thursday highlighted the case of three engineers who remained at a project site in an area not controlled by Afghan forces and required an “emergency air rescue”.Among the five provincial capitals captured by the Taliban since Thursday was Pul-e-Alam, the capital of Logar, which put the group’s fighters just 70 km south of Kabul. While a recent estimate by US security agencies had stated that the Taliban could take Kabul within 30 days, the latest reports suggest the Taliban could tighten their grip on areas around the capital and march towards the city within days.Among the provincial capitals captured by the Taliban since August 6 are Zaranj, Sheberghan, Sar-e-Pul, Kunduz, Taloqan, Aybak, Pul-e-Khumri, Faizabad, Ghazni, Herat, Kandahar, Qala-e-Naw, Lashkargah, Pul-e-Alam, Tarinkot, Qalat and Firozkoh. While the fall of provincial capitals in sparsely populated regions in the north were initially attributed to the Afghan government’s new security policy focused on larger and more populated urban centres, the rapid fall of Kandahar and Herat, Afghanistan’s second and third largest cities, dramatically altered the ground situation. The capture of Ghazni also cut the highway between Kabul and southern Kandahar.Despite the Taliban being emboldened by the US drawdown and showing little inclination to return to the negotiating table, India and other countries are continuing with efforts to press for a political settlement and an immediate truce.On Thursday, India joined Germany, Qatar and Turkey in calling for an immediate ceasefire in Afghanistan and asserting that any government imposed by military force in Kabul would not be recognised.A statement issued by Qatar following a meeting of special envoys and representatives of India, Germany, Norway, Qatar, Tajikistan, Turkey and Turkmenistan in Doha also highlighted the urgent need to accelerate the process to find a negotiated settlement.The statement said two separate meetings on Afghanistan – one joined by the representatives of China, Uzbekistan, the US, Pakistan, the UK, Qatar, the UN and the European Union on August 10, and the other held on August 12 – had agreed that the participants “will not recognize any government in Afghanistan that is imposed through the use of military force”.The countries also agreed on the need to accelerate the Afghan peace process as a “very urgent and essential issue for negotiating concrete proposals from both sides”.The participants urged the Taliban and the Afghan government to “build trust and accelerate efforts to reach a political settlement and comprehensive ceasefire as quickly as possible”, and to stop “violence and attacks immediately in and against provincial capitals and other cities”.The meetings expressed “grave concerns” about reports from across Afghanistan regarding violence, high civilian casualties, extrajudicial killings, widespread and credible allegations of human rights violations, and the destruction of physical infrastructure that make reconciliation efforts more difficult.As part of desperate efforts to counter the Taliban’s advance, UN Security Council members Estonia and Norway drafted a statement to condemn the group’s attacks on cities and towns resulting in high civilian casualties. According to Reuters, the draft statement, which has to be agreed by consensus by the 15-member body, threatens sanctions for abuses and acts that risk Afghanistan’s peace and stability.The text also “strongly affirms that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is not recognized at the United Nations and declares that it does not and will not support the establishment of any government in Afghanistan imposed through military force or restoration of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan”.This is largely in line with the position taken by India, which holds the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council for August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ready-for-all-contingencies-in-afghanistan-says-india-101628878678446.html
14-08-2021||India||LeT terrorist killed in Kulgam encounter||Security forces killed a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist on Friday morning, ending the overnight gunfight in Kulgam on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway, police said, adding that the second terrorist managed to escape.Two security personnel and two civilians were wounded in the exchange of fire between terrorists and security forces on Thursday. Police said a major tragedy was averted ahead of the Independence Day as the terrorists were planning for a big attack.Inspector General of Police, Kashmir range, Vijay Kumar said they had inputs that terrorists will strike ahead of Independence Day on the national highway from Baramulla to Qazigund. “A big tragedy has been averted. As the terrorist fired, it was retaliated with a strong response within no time.”The terrorist killed in the encounter was identified as Usman from Pakistan, affiliated to LeT, and had been active in south Kashmir for the last six months, police said.A huge cache of arms and ammunition, including an AK-47 rifle, magazines, grenades, RPG-7 rocket launcher, was recovered from the encounter site, Kumar said. He added it shows the “terrorists were planning something big”.“It is after a long time that RPG-7 has been recovered (in Kashmir) and the police and security forces have averted a major incident. I am proud of the police and security forces,” Kumar said, adding, “We achieved a major success by killing Usman – the dreaded Pakistani terrorist.”On Thursday, police said two LeT terrorists were hiding in a building adjacent to the Jammu-Srinagar national highway. The terrorists got trapped inside the building after they fired at the Border Security Force convoy on the highway at Malpora in Kulgam.There has been a spurt in terrorist attacks in Kashmir ahead of Independence Day celebrations on August 15.On Tuesday, 10 civilians were injured in a grenade attack by suspected terrorists in Srinagar. The terrorists attempted to hurl the grenade towards a bunker vehicle of SSB forces but it exploded on the roadside.On Monday, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Kisan Morcha chief in Kulgam, Ghulam Rasool Dar, and his wife died after terrorists fired at the couple in the Lal Chowk area of Anantnag in south Kashmir.Ahead of Independence Day, security has been beefed up around Kashmir and forces have set up additional checking points on major highways leading to rural parts of Kashmir. Even pedestrians are being frisked at many places, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-terrorist-killed-in-kulgam-encounter-101628878614593.html
14-08-2021||India||Assam approves bill to regulate cattle slaughter, transport, sale of beef||The Assam assembly on Friday passed a controversial legislation regulating the transportation, and slaughter of all cattle, and sale of beef and beef products in the state. Though the bill does not ban the beef business, experts said it virtually shuts all doors on running it in the state.The definition of cattle, as per the bill, includes all cow genus, including bull, calf and heifer. Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma informed the House that buffaloes will be exempted from provisions of the Bill.Cattle slaughter is permitted in Assam with certain procedural conditions, as is the sale and consumption of beef.The Assam Cattle Preservation Bill, 2021, was passed through a voice vote after opposition members, who wanted the Bill to be sent to a Select Committee during a two-hour discussion on the legislation, staged a walk out from the House.The legislation bans interstate transport of cows through Assam, ostensibly to control their smuggling to neighbouring Bangladesh. It also bans transport of cattle from other states through Assam to places outside the state, and from any place within Assam to places outside the state “where slaughter of cattle is not regulated by law”. Further, movement of cattle from one place within the state to another located in Assam is also restricted, though a competent authority may issue permits for the transport of cattle for bona fide agricultural or animal husbandry purposes.The bill also bans the sale of beef in areas with a predominant population of Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and other non-beef-eating communities, or within a radius of 5km of any temple, ‘satra’ (Vaishnavite monastery) “or other religious institutions belonging to Hindu religion”.Violations of the provisions of the bill could lead to imprisonment for three to eight years and fine between ₹3 lakh and ₹5 lakh.“Data shows that most of the cases of communal tension in Lower Assam in the past few years are related to beef. The provisions of the Bill will lead to communal harmony as it would allow those who consume beef to eat it with some restrictions and also respect the sentiments of non-beef eating communities like Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs,” Sarma said.“We don’t have any ill intention in introducing the Bill. And real Muslims who understand it would have no opposition to it. There’s no ban on eating beef, those who want can eat it 5km away from temples and satras. Communal harmony can prevail only when Muslims respect sentiments of Hindus as much as Hindus respect the sentiments of Muslims,” he added.The Opposition suggested 76 amendments to the Bill including, removal of restrictions on interdistrict transportation of cattle, relaxation of the ban on slaughter of cattle within a 5km radius of temples and satras (Vaishnavite monasteries), and the removalof strict penalties such as eight-year imprisonment and heavy fines for violators.Its leaders also contended that the state will lose revenue since the cattle trade in Assam is worth ₹20,000 crores annually.“The proposed bill in its present form can lead to various problems for people associated with cattle trade, beef products and business in cattle skin etc. I propose that it should be sent to a select committee of assembly to get their views on its efficacy,” said Congress legislature party leader Debabrata Saikia.“Instead of looking at this Bill from a religious perspective, one needs to view it from other angles. Unlike popularly believed, consumption of beef is not mandatory among Muslims and Christians. It is a food product like any other. We should see what impact socio-economic impact the Bill would have in Assam,” said All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) MLA Aminul Islam.Experts criticised the bill, saying that it “targeted at a particular community and has a communal angle”. “It is worth mentioning that this Bill was the first one introduced in the newly elected assembly by the second BJP-led government in Assam. It is extremely worrying that at a time when human lives are in peril due to Covid-19, the government is more focussed on protecting cows. It would have an adverse impact on rural economy irrespective of religion, caste or community as many are involved in raising cows and their trade. Instead of protecting cows through this Bill, the government should have looked at improving the shabby infrastructure of veterinary hospitals in the state. The government may say otherwise, the Bill is targeted at a particular community and has a communal angle. It’s an out and out political move and sends a very bad signal at a time when the state is facing multiple challenges due to Covid-19,” said Akhil Ranjan Dutta, political science professor at Gauhati University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-approves-bill-to-regulate-cattle-slaughter-transport-sale-of-beef-101628878435918.html
14-08-2021||India||HC judges should have discipline, cannot overreach our orders: SC||“Dare they try to do it again,” an exasperated Supreme Court remarked on Friday while taking strong exception to a high court order which tried to bypass the mandate of the top court.“We want the high court judges to have some discipline. They cannot overreach our orders. We cannot accept this conduct,” commented a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah when it came across an order of the Punjab & Haryana high court, passed in contradiction to a Supreme Court order.Justice Chandrachud went on to add that he was going to raise the issue with Chief Justice of India NV Ramana. “How can a high court do this? I will bring this to the attention of the honourable CJI,” said the judge.The court’s anguish arose out of an order by the high court that quashed a show-cause notice issued to a private firm by the excise and tax department of Chandigarh. The bench noted that an earlier order of the high court quashing the previous notices was already stayed by the Supreme Court in December 2020. An application filed by the firm, M/s Shiva Traders, the bench observed, was also pending before it for restraining the department to go ahead with the tax assessment proceedings.However, the firm moved the high court in February against a show-cause notice, and the high court nixed it.“How could the high court entertain the writ petition when it was aware that the case is pending before us? The company had also filed an application before us and it is still pending. But the high court went ahead and passed the order which was being asked for before us,” rued the bench.Advocate Nikhil Goel, appearing for Chandigarh Administration, informed the court that the case involved an inquiry into 884 fabricated entries of assessment and there were fake entries to show that a tax demand of ₹5 crore had been settled for ₹5,000.On his part, senior advocate Puneet Bali submitted on behalf of the firm that a mere stay of the high court order will not revive the show-cause notice automatically.“But you already had filed your application before us trying to restrain the department from proceedings against you. So, why did you go to the high court? And how could the high court entertain you after knowing about all this? It is now between this court and the high court. You are just a party there. And we will not tolerate this,” retorted the bench.It then set aside the high court order, recording in its order that “the high court has overreached the jurisdiction” of the Supreme Court.“The high court should have straightaway dismissed the writ petition (of the firm). Not only the ad interim order is unsustainable but the very act of the high court in entertaining the writ petition shows a lack of respect for pendency of proceedings before this court which this court exercises in its appellate jurisdiction,” stated the court in its order.It directed that a copy of its order be transferred to the registrar general of the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-judges-should-have-discipline-cannot-overreach-our-orders-sc-101628878435242.html
14-08-2021||India||Govt plans to honour ‘unsung’ freedom fighters on 75th Independence Day||The Union government is planning to showcase unsung heros and little-known groups and events of the freedom struggle during the yearlong celebrations to mark 75 years of India’s independence, officials said on Friday, adding that several events and lectures will be organised to underline their contribution.The government has drawn up a list of 146 names and planned 75 regional, six national and two international seminars under the banner of “Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav”, the campaign to mark 75 years of Independence.The names have been compiled separatelyby government departments and the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), an autonomous body under the Union education ministry.But some historians have criticised the presence of well-known figures such as Subhas Chandra Bose, Birsa Munda and Tantiya Tope, and called for a revamp. Also included are Jana Sangh ideologue Nanaji Deshmukh and the Hindu Mahasabha in the list compiled by government departments.“When Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March flagged of the 75-week long programme Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav to commemorate 75 years of India’s independence, he referred to a shlok (verse) of Yajurveda. Through that he (PM) conveyed that in the last seven decades we have missed some opportunities to celebrate those who did not get any acknowledgment yet for their role in India’s freedom struggle. So, ICHR has planned a three-tier programme to celebrate the lives of our unsung heroes,” said ICHR director (research and administration) Om Jee Upadhayay.The 146 names have been classified by state of origin, and also include figures from smaller tribes and castes. In the list are Gandhians such as Ghelubhai Naik, agricultural economist Mohanlal Lallubhai Dantwala, former Jana Sangh idelogue Nanaji Deshmukh, and communist leader Ravi Narayan Reddy.The list of also includes several tribal leaders, including Laxman Nayak from Odisha, Telanga Kharia from Jharkhand and Komaram Bheem from Telangana.The list of little-known groups includes Hindu Mahasabha, Andhra Pradesh Library Association, Karnataka Sahitya Parishad, and Bengal’s Anusheelan Samiti, among others.The government also drew up lists of lesser-known events and literature.The first list included the Surat salt agitation (1840s), war against the company raj, also known as the sepoy mutiny, (1857-58), Bundelkhand resistance (1808), and Rangpur peasant uprising (1783), among others.The second list includes Ekshlok Geeta (Marathi book, 1910), Hindu Dharm Ka Jhanda (Hindi pamphlet 1927), Gadar di Gunj (Gurumukhi, 1910), Chauri Chaura judgment (English, 1923), and Inquilab (Urdu, 1927), among others.Some experts criticised the inclusions.“We cannot call Subhas Chandra Bose, Chandrashekhar Azad and Birsa Munda as ‘unsung heroes’. They have included Tantiya Tope, Nanaji Deshmukh, and Ravi Narayan Reddy also in the list. In fact, the list included some names in the list of people who were born in the 1930s and called freedom fighters. It’s a very uneven list,” said historian Mridula Mukherjee. “There is no consistency in the selection of names, it is a haphazard list.’’ she added.Bharatiya Janata Party MP and head of the standing committee of education, Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, disagreed.“If you have not done justice to them, then there has to be a time to do justice. Whether it is Subhas Chandra Bose or any of the others, they haven’t received the credit they deserve,’’ said the MP.Sucheta Mahajan, historian and professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), said the names from some states were indeed of people who were “lesser known” but added that some other names -- such as Bose -- were of popular figures“We should make a distinction on when we use the term freedom struggle. We should pick up people from the late 19th century when the national consciousness came. So, in my opinion people from 1857 cannot be known as freedom fighters. The list definitely needs a revamp,” she said.When asked about criteria of identifying these names, Upadhayay said, “There was no set criterion. We tried to cover all those who contributed or sacrificed their lives for the country but still they are not a part of our mainstream history. We have to update the list almost every day as we get a new name from states or other stakeholders.”He said the seminars will be conducted by ICHR, adding that it will be done in the next 4-5 months.“In academia, everyone may have his or her own arguments. But we are very clear regarding this, that unsung means those who couldn’t find appropriate place in mainstream history, besides their significant contributions in the freedom struggle,” said Upadhayay.Officials pointed out that the list contained personalities like Andhra poet Garimella Satyanarayana, lawyer Bhulabhai Desai from Gujarat, freedom fighter Senapati Bapat from Maharashtra, Captain Mohammad Akram from Punjab, Rao Tula Ram from Haryana, and Mirza Mughal from Delhi, among others.From the North-East states, Rani Gaidinliu from Manipur, Tirrot Singh from Meghalaya, Batan Kachari from Assam, Shanti Bhushan from Tripura and Trilochan Pokhrel from Sikkim were part of the list.“The irony is those who had nothing to do with the freedom movement and consistently attacked Mahatma Gandhi and his lieutenants are now basking in the glory of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav,” tweeted Congress leader Jairam Ramesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-to-honour-unsung-freedom-fighters-on-75th-independence-day-101628878375324.html
14-08-2021||India||SC: Ensure smaller cities don’t become polluted like Mumbai||The Union and state governments should make sure that small cities do not become what Mumbai is today, the Supreme Court said on Friday while describing Maharashtra’s capital as one of the most polluted cities in the country.A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah emphasised that smaller cities have to be protected from the kind of development and changes that a big city like Mumbai went through.“If you don’t take steps for cities which are on the brink of industrialisation then what quality of life will these cities have after some years? They will go down the same way,” the bench told the two law officers of the Centre, appearing on behalf of the environment and urban development ministries.The court’s comments came after additional solicitor general KM Natraj, representing the urban development ministry, submitted that the norms for effluent discharge by sewage treatment plants (STPs) in water bodies cannot be the same for all the cities.“Smaller cities cannot compete with a city like Mumbai,” he argued.“Mumbai is worse than smaller cities. Just make sure smaller cities don’t become Mumbai, what it is today. Also, you are talking about different norms but can you say that people in smaller cities deserve a different standard of life? Every citizen is entitled to the same quality of life. In fact, cross-subsidisation has to be there. What is the Union and the state doing? You should provide funds wherever required to make sure smaller cities are protected,” it said.On her part, ASG Aishwarya Bhati, who appeared for the environment ministry, regretted the lack of infrastructure in tier two and three cities with regard to checking the deterioration of water quality.“So, the Union and the states should make infrastructure available. Why should people in a tier two or three city not get the same quality of life that a tier one city has? Everybody is entitled to the same standard of life. We are here to soften the rough edges of law but the governments will have to take the lead,” responded the bench.The court was hearing appeals by the central government and the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) against an order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2019. The NGT had found fault with the ministry’s 2017 notification by which new norms for effluent discharge by sewage treatment plants (STPs) in water bodies were laid down. It held that the new notification would lead to deterioration of water quality and prescribed stricter standards based on the recommendations of an expert committee.While the expert committee had suggested a time frame of seven years for existing STPs to switch to higher sewage treatment criteria, the tribunal directed that the existing STPs should apply these norms “without any delay”. The NGT had further held that standards recommended for mega and metropolitan cities will also apply to the rest of the country.At the same time, the green tribunal had imposed a penalty of around ₹100 crore on the MCGM for continued pollution of the city’s creeks and water bodies by discharge of inadequately treated effluent into drains from different STPs. By an order in July, the NGT directed that municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal be present in person to explain why adverse orders should not be passed against him for continuing violations.On Friday, the top court stayed the NGT’s order asking for Chahal’s presence and asked the MCGM to submit a comprehensive response before the tribunal, detailing the steps taken and the timelines of those being contemplated.“Protection of the environment is a matter of the highest concern...The issue is serious since it relates to discharge of untreated waste into the sea. MCGM must, in good faith efforts, demonstrate what steps it has taken to upgrade existing facilities and what it plans to do. This order cannot be taken as a carte blanche to continue to violate environmental norms and the municipal corporation must follow all the standards in the meantime,” stated the bench in its order.The court also clarified that financial constraints cannot be cited by MCGM as a reason not to upgrade the STPs, especially when the municipal body happens to have a budget of ₹10,000 crore which is more than the budget of some states.“The municipal corporation cannot turn a blind eye and keep dumping untreated waste in the sea. Your corporation is ranked number one in the entire country. Please act like one,” the bench told senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Dhruv Mehta, representing the MCGM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-ensure-smaller-cities-don-t-become-polluted-like-mumbai-101628877842824.html
14-08-2021||India||Twitter is biased, only listens to govt: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday accused social media company Twitter of being “a biased platform” that “listens to what the government says”, calling restrictions on his and his party colleagues’ accounts as interference with India’s political process.Gandhi’s statement, issued in a video uploaded to YouTube, came after nearly 5,000 Twitter accounts including his, the party’s official handle, and multiple senior leaders’ was temporarily blocked for sharing a photograph that included the parents of an alleged rape victim. “This is an attack on the democratic structure of the country,” Gandhi said in the statement. “A company is making its business to define our politics,” he said warning investors that “taking sides in the political contest has repercussions for Twitter.”The company said on Thursday it was enforcing its terms of use – Indian law too prohibits the identification of victims of a sexual crime or of any material that can lead to their identity becoming known – but the party has accused it of bias by pointing to similar images of “a government body” that did not lead to account restrictions.“It’s obvious now that Twitter is actually not a neutral, objective platform. It is a biased platform. It’s something that listens to what the government of the day says,” Gandhi alleged, saying Twitter was previously “a ray of light” as it provided space for people to put out their opinions. On Friday, Twitter reiterated a statement it released a day before. The company said it enforces its rules judiciously and impartially. “We have taken proactive action on several hundred Tweets that posted an image that violated our Rules, and may continue to do so in line with our range of enforcement options,” a Twitter spokesperson said. “Certain types of private information carry higher risks than others, and our aim is always to protect individuals’ privacy and safety. We strongly encourage everyone on the service to familiarise themselves with the Twitter Rules and report anything they believe is in violation.”Twitter admitted that it was alerted by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) about Gandhi’s tweet which revealed the victim’s identity. It added that it reviewed the tweet against Twitter rules and policies, as well as the concerns expressed as a matter of the Indian law. The NCPCR has moved the Delhi High Court over the issue. Gandhi stuck to his guns on Friday, saying the locking of his account was not an attack on him but on his 20 million followers.Ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal rejected the suggestion that Twitter is acting under government pressure. “Twitter even suspended former information technology minister (Ravi Shankar Prasad)’s handle (over alleged copyright infringement in June) too. When the government was trying to fix the accountability of the social media giant and regulate it, Congress opposed the action. For anything and everything, they blame the Modi government.” Agarwal asked Congress to support the government’s efforts to regulate tech companies and to hold them accountable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-slams-twitter-calls-it-biased-platform-101628837931884.html

14-08-2021||Today's||A look back at the War of Bharat’s Independence||Bharat is celebrating the festival of liberation from colonial dependence. Amid this series of celebrations, while the journey of 75 years of independent Bharat will be evaluated, it is also natural to remember the constant struggle and sacrifice of more than four centuries to achieve it.The national movement against this colonial slavery in Bharat was inspired by the spirit of swa, self, whose manifestation was churning the whole country in the form of a trilogy of swadharma, swaraj and swadeshi. As a result of the presence of saints and sages in the movement, spiritual consciousness was constantly flowing in the form of an undercurrent.The spirit of self, which has been in the soul of Bharat for ages, manifested itself with all its might, and these foreign powers had to face resistance at every step. These forces destroyed Bharat’s economic, social, cultural, and educational system; they also destroyed village self-reliance. It was a totalitarian invasion by foreign powers, which Bharat retaliated against in all spheres of life.The Bharatiya resistance against European powers is a unique example in world history. It was a multifaceted effort in which, on the one hand, armed resistance was being undertaken against the foreign invasion, and on the other, the work of social reconstruction was taking place by removing the distortions in society to make it strong.While the kings of the princely states were resisting the British with all their might, the janjati society rose from place to place against the interference of the British in their simple lives and the attack on their values of life. These people who woke up to protect their values were brutally massacred by the British, but they did not back down from the struggle. The nationwide war of Independence of 1857, in which hundreds of thousands of people sacrificed their lives, was a result of this.To thwart the efforts to destroy the Bharatiya education system, institutions such as Banaras Hindu University, Shantiniketan, Gujarat Vidyapeeth, MDT Hindu College Tirunelveli, Karve Shikshan Sanstha, Deccan Education Society and Gurukul Kangri rose and created a sense of patriotism among the students and youth. While scientists such as Prafulla Chandra Ray and Jagdish Chandra Basu dedicated their talents for the upliftment of Bharat, artistes such as Nandlal Bose, Avanindranath Thakur and Dadasaheb Phalke and almost all national leaders, including Makhanlal Chaturvedi, were involved in public awareness through journalism. They were awakening the country through their arts. The spiritual inspiration of many learned men such as Maharishi Dayanand, Swami Vivekananda and Maharishi Aurobindo acted as the guiding light for all of them. While Hindu fairs being organised by Rajnarayan Bose in Bengal, Ganeshotsav and Shivaji Utsav by Lokmanya Tilak in Maharashtra were watering Bharat’s cultural roots, social reformers such as Jyotiba Phule and Savitribai Phule were engaged in the creative campaign of promoting women’s education and empowering the underprivileged sections of society. BR Ambedkar showed the way to organise society and struggle for achieving social equality.No area of Bharatiya social life remained untouched by the influence of Mahatma Gandhi. While living abroad, the work of giving an edge to the Bharatiya independence movement was progressing under the patronage of people such as Shyamji Krishna Varma, Lala Hardayal and Madam Cama. London’s India House had become the centre of activities related to Bharat’s independence. The Bharatiya War of Independence 1857, written by Veer Savarkar, was very popular among revolutionaries. Bhagat Singh himself got it published and distributed hundreds of copies of it.The revolutionaries involved in more than 400 underground organisations operating across the country were engaged in the campaign to free Bharat Mata by putting their lives at stake. Active in the activities of Anushilan Samiti, the revolutionary organisation of Bengal, Keshav Baliram Hedgewar joined the Congress, thanks to the inspiration of Lokmanya Tilak and was elected as the secretary of the Central Provinces. He was the vice-president of the organising committee of the party’s national convention held in Nagpur in 1920. In this session, he, along with his colleagues, made every effort to get the resolution of purna swaraj, complete independence, passed, but the Congress leadership was not ready for it. Ultimately, this resolution was passed in Lahore after nine years, in January, 1929.Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose took over the leadership of the Azad Hind Fauj during World War II. Not only was the first government of independent Bharat formed under his leadership, but the Azad Hind Fauj also succeeded in liberating some parts of Northeast Bharat. The trial of the officers of the Azad Hind Fauj in Red Fort filled the whole country with fury. Along with this, the rebellion by the Navy against the British officers forced the British to leave Bharat.The sun of freedom rose, but the eclipse of Partition had fallen on it. The credit for the courage to move forward even in difficult circumstances goes to every Bharatiya who shed his blood and sweat to fulfil the national aspiration of hundreds of years.Maharishi Arvind had said – Bharat has to wake up, not for itself but for the whole world, for humanity. His declaration proved to be true when Bharat’s independence became an inspiration for the freedom fighters of other countries of the world. One by one, all the colonies became independent, and Britain’s never-ending sun went down forever.The Portuguese, Dutch, French and, lastly, the British came to Bharat. Alongside trade, all of them made constant efforts to destroy Bhartiya culture and engage in proselytisation. The retaliation against colonialism had begun on the very day that Vasco da Gama, the first European traveller, set foot on Bharatiya soil in the year 1498. The Dutch had to leave Bharat after being defeated at the hands of Maharaja Marthanda Varma of Travancore. The Portuguese remained confined to Goa. In the struggle for supremacy, the British eventually proved to be the victors who, on the strength of their devious policies, established control over a little more than half of Bharat. The rest of Bharat remained under the control of Bharatiya rulers with whom the British made treaties. After Independence, the union of these states emerged as the Republic of Bharat.Bharat chose the path of democracy. Today, it is the largest and most successful democracy in the world. Those who contributed to the freedom movement to protect the cultural values of Bharat also performed the duty of framing the Constitution for Bharat. This is the reason that in the first copy of the Constitution, arrangements were made to keep the cultural flow of Bharat intact by displaying the image of Ram Rajya through pictures and exponents of Bharatiyata such as Vyasa, Buddha and Mahavira.This “Amrit Mahotsav of Bharatiya Independence” is an occasion to show gratitude towards patriots due to whose sacrifice, we are moving towards getting our rightful place in the world community as an independent nation. Those unnamed heroes, events left out of discussion, institutions, and places, which gave direction to the freedom movement and proved to be milestones, will have to be reviewed, evaluated, and preserved in the folk memories associated with them. They should be introduced to the mainstream so that the coming generations understand that behind the innately available freedom today, there lies a struggle of past generations for the nation and their blood, sweat, and tears of many centuries.Dattatreya Hosabale is the sarkaryavah of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak SanghThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/a-look-back-at-the-war-of-bharat-s-independence-101628950382177.html
