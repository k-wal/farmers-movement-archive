30-08-2021||News||The uncertain future of India’s economic relationship with Afghanistan||The forceful capture of power in Afghanistan by the Taliban has halted all reconstruction and development works undertaken by India in the country for almost two decades. India, as a close neighbour, had been assisting the reconstruction and development efforts of the government and people of Afghanistan as part of the endeavour to bring stability to the country.The search for stability and goodwill What has India gained by its efforts in the reconstruction of Afghanistan? The intent was never economic, but instead, the stability of the region and the goodwill of Afghans. The then external affairs minister (EAM) SM Krishna in February 2010 told the Rajya Sabha: “The situation in Afghanistan is of direct concern to India, since we have an abiding interest in the stability and prosperity of that country and since we are directly impacted by developments in that region.“India does not see assistance in Afghanistan’s reconstruction as being a zero-sum game. Our assistance programme in Afghanistan has earned us goodwill among the ordinary people there...” he added.More than a decade later, a Cabinet minister, who did not wish to be named given the sensitivity of the situation in Afghanistan, said the crisis will not have a significant direct impact on the Indian economy or its industry, but instability in Afghanistan is not desirable for the economic development of the region.“Bilateral trade between the two is minuscule. But, recent developments [Talibanisation] of the neighbouring nation may certainly hamper [the] Indian government’s humanitarian aid and other ongoing developmental projects in the country,” the minister said, who did not wish to be named because of the precarious situation in the neighbouring country.According to industry and official data, India has so far completed more than 400 projects covering all 34 provinces of Afghanistan, worth billions of dollars in the reconstruction of the nation, to help the war-torn neighbour to become strong, democratic and prosperous.Also Read | In Perspective: India’s big bet on dronesEAM S Jaishankar, in March, said India’s “long-term commitment towards a peaceful, sovereign, stable and inclusive Afghanistan where the rights of all sections of the society are protected within a democratic constitutional framework”. The EAM’s comments are still relevant for India, a government official said requesting anonymity.The economic stakes According to official data, India’s trade with Afghanistan is negligible, a mere 0.19% of $686.24 billion total trade in 2020-21. Bilateral trade between the two countries was only about $800 million in 2016-17. It grew to $1.52 billion in 2019-20 only to slip to $1.33 billion in 2020-21.India’s export to Afghanistan is a minuscule 0.28% of its total exports of $291.8 billion, according to data from the commerce ministry. India exported goods worth $825.78 million in 2020-21, a year-on-year contraction of 17.22%. It imported goods worth $509.49 million in FY-21, 0.13% of India total imports of $394.43 billion that year.The top 10 commodities India exports to Afghanistan are sugar, garments, manmade yarn and fabric, pharmaceuticals, woollens, handicrafts, manufactured tobacco, fresh fruits, spices, and iron and steel products. It imports spices, fruits and nuts, lac, gum, resins, herbal products and processed fruits and vegetables.The possible impact Sanjay Aggarwal, president at PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI), said that the political and economic developments in Afghanistan would not have “major ramifications” for the Indian economy as trade between the two nations is meagre.But he added that trade between the two countries would drop significantly. “Afghanistan is a landlocked country with air route as an important medium of exports. With the restricted airspace for India in Afghanistan, the trade with Afghanistan is expected to stand still for some time,” he said.Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) director-general, Chandrajit Banerjee, said the dedicated air freight corridor service, which started on June 19, 2017, had augmented Afghan exports to India and directly benefited the Afghan farmers and small traders and exporters.Also Read | Dindori: As district gets added to India’s Maoist map, what it means for StateBut CII members remain hopeful. “Agricultural products make up 65.8% of Afghanistan’s exports. Dry fruits are among its most exported agricultural products. India is one of the biggest destinations of Afghanistan’s exports as the products are imported at concessional tariffs due to a preferential trading arrangement between India and Afghanistan... The events unfolding in Afghanistan have taken place when Afghan farmers are in the process of harvesting the dry fruits for exporting to Indian markets for the upcoming festive season. Indian importers are hopeful that trade routes would reopen in time for sourcing these products for the festive season,” he added.A spokesperson of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) terms recent developments in Afghanistan as a “grave humanitarian crisis”.“In the middle of such a crisis, it would be premature to assess the economic impact of the deteriorating geopolitical developments in Afghanistan. However, events of such a magnitude are bound to leave a deleterious impact on the economy of that country,” the spokesperson said. According to Assocham, Indian investments in Afghanistan are of a “strategic” imperative.Indian projects in Afghanistan: Salma Dam: One of India’s high-visibility hydropower and irrigation projects — the 42MW Salma Dam in Herat province — was completed against all odds and inaugurated in 2016. It is known as the Afghan-India Friendship Dam.Zaranj-Delaram highway: The other high-profile Indian project was the 218-km Zaranj-Delaram highway built by the Border Roads Organisation. Zaranj is located close to Afghanistan’s border with Iran. With Pakistan denying India overland access for trade with Afghanistan, the highway is of strategic importance to New Delhi, as it provides an alternative route into landlocked Afghanistan through Iran’s Chabahar port. Over 300 Indian engineers and workers toiled alongside Afghans to build the road. According to the ministry of external affairs, 11 Indians and 129 Afghans lost their lives during the construction. Six of the Indians were killed in terrorist attacks; five in accidents. India has also built several smaller roads.Also Read | Chhattisgarh: The inside story of the Bhupesh Baghel-TS Singh Deo battleParliament: The Afghan Parliament in Kabul was built by India at $90 million. It was opened in 2015; Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi inaugurated the building. In an expansive speech about India-Afghanistan friendship, he quoted Rumi, who was born in Balkh, Afghanistan, and the immortal Yaari hai imaan mera yaar meri zindagi from the movie Zanjeer, featuring Pran in the role of Sher Khan, the Pathan. Modi described the building as India’s tribute to democracy in Afghanistan. A block in the building is named after former PM AB Vajpayee.Stor Palace: In 2016, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and PM Modi inaugurated the restored Stor Palace in Kabul, originally built in the late 19th century. The building housed the offices of the Afghan foreign minister and the ministry until 1965. In 2009, India, Afghanistan, and the Aga Khan Development Network signed a tripartite agreement for its restoration. The Aga Khan Trust for Culture completed the project between 2013 and 2016.Power infra: Other Indian projects in Afghanistan include the rebuilding of power infrastructure such as the 220kV DC transmission line from Pul-e-Khumri, capital of Baghlan province to the north of Kabul, to beef up electricity supply to the capital. Indian contractors and workers also restored telecommunications infrastructure in many provinces.Health: India has reconstructed a children’s hospital it had helped build in Kabul in 1972 — named Indira Gandhi Institute for Child Health in 1985 — that was in a shambles after the war. “Indian Medical Missions” have held free consultation camps in several areas. Thousands who lost their limbs after stepping on mines left over from the war have been fitted with the Jaipur Foot. India also built clinics in the border provinces of Badakhshan, Balkh, Kandahar, Khost, Kunar, Nangarhar, Nimruz, Nooristan, Paktia and Paktika.Transportation: According to MEA, India gifted 400 buses and 200 minibuses for urban transportation, 105 utility vehicles for municipalities, 285 military vehicles for the Afghan National Army, and 10 ambulances for public hospitals in five cities. It also gave three Air India aircraft to Ariana, the Afghan national carrier, when it was restarting operations.Other projects: India has contributed desks and benches for schools, built solar panels in remote villages, constructed Sulabh toilet blocks in Kabul. New Delhi has also played a role in building capacity, with vocational training institutes, scholarships to Afghan students, mentoring programmes in the civil service, and training for doctors and others.Ongoing projects: Last November, Jaishankar announced that India had concluded an agreement with Afghanistan for the construction of the Shatoot Dam in Kabul district, which will provide safe drinking water to 2 million residents. He also announced the start of some 100 community development projects worth $80 million. Last year, India pledged $1 million for another Aga Khan heritage project, the restoration of the Bala Hissar Fort south of Kabul, whose origins go back to the 6th century. Bala Hissar went on to become a significant Mughal fort, parts of it were rebuilt by Jahangir, and it was used as a residence by Shah Jahan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-uncertain-future-of-india-s-economic-relationship-with-afghanistan-101630328083601.html
30-08-2021||News||In Perspective: India’s big bet on drones||Last week, India’s civil aviation ministry notified new rules covering drones — the second time that regulations were updated this year itself. Citing feedback from several quarters, the government said the rules published in March were seen as being restrictive.The resulting rules appear to recognise that the previous regulations more or less amounted to throwing the baby out with the bathwater – a labyrinthine process ostensibly aimed at keeping the skies safe meant people had to navigate through 25 forms, obtain a remote pilots’ license, and get a security clearance before they could fly drones for simple uses such as wedding photography.In the rules notified on August 26, much of this red tape has been done away with and India’s regulatory framework now appears to be on par with global practices. This will be crucial because drones have emerged as a crucial part of future technologies. World over, the small flying machines are gathering data from hard-to-reach places, helping humans avoid treacherous locations, improving the speed of life-saving assistance and may someday even emerge as a mode of transport.The government indicated that it recognises this potential and announced it wants to go further by helping establish an industry around it. Here, we decode some of the crucial ways in which the rules have changed and the gains it could lead to, as well as note some of the concerns that persist.What are the big improvements?The biggest change that will help the government’s objective is the way people can now gain authorisation to fly drones. A vast proportion of users are likely to fall in the recreational category and the most popular devices in this segment (due to their affordability and practicality) are likely to be classified as micro and nano drones. People will no longer need a remote pilot’s license.Also Read | In Perspective: Taliban, tech and the fight for Afghanistan’s futureThe government has also done away with the need for a security clearance.The number of forms and amount of fees have been whittled down too – people now need to identify one of five forms and have to pay one of four categories of fees.The rules also make it easier for companies wanting to deploy drones as well as those seeking to produce or import it. Previously, a foreign company or its subsidiary was not allowed to operate drones in India. Imports would not be possible unless the civil aviation regulator, DGCA, issued a specific import clearance. Now, both of these hurdles have been removed.How will they help?Encouraging use: The initial boost is likely to be evident in the nano and micro drone categories that are popular with hobbyists. The smallest “nano” category start at close to ₹50,000. But the rules also make it easier for researchers to deploy drones. In India, some of these applications have been in agriculture and geomapping – these are areas where adoption is likely to automatically increase.Encouraging industry: Companies carrying out R&D of drones have been exempted from filing for certification or remote flying licence if they use the drones within premises they own or rent. This will benefit companies making their own drones for sale. The rules also exempt certification requirements for drones that are not meant for use in India and are only being exported, and pitch for a council to be formed to promote drones. Market analysts expect India’s drone market to log an annual growth rate of over 12% — if the country is able to establish a production ecosystem to cater to such demand, it will lead to thousands of new jobs.Encouraging innovation: Civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said, while briefing the media on the new regulations, that the rules pave way for ultimately even allowing Uber-like drone taxis. A key point that backs up the support for innovation is also the plan for a dedicated drone corridor for cargo deliveries.What India needs to think aboutThere are two particular areas of concern that persist.First, drones are expected to capture vast amounts of data. This will inevitably include sensitive information, such as the location of an individual, their residence and nature of their large assets such as property and vehicle. Advances in technology mean operators can also potentially use drones for close surveillance, using, for instance, face recognition. At present, the regulatory mechanism proposed under the personal data protection law to prohibit the abuse of such data is yet to be put in place.Second, companies have flagged some concerns with the technical portions of the framework for regulation of drone use. In particular, this has to do with the Digital Sky platform and a feature known as no-permission, no-take off (NPNT). A representative of drone maker DJI, for instance, flagged the lack of development of the Digital Sky portal. Separately, experts also foresee problems in the use of the NPNT system, which is meant to act as an automatic geofencing system to prohibit a drone from taking off in a red zone, or breach the 200 ft ceiling in a yellow zone.In Perspective takes a deep dive into current issues, the visible and invisible factors at play, and their implications for our future.

30-08-2021||News||Chhattisgarh: The inside story of the Bhupesh Baghel-TS Singh Deo battle||It was the afternoon of December 15, 2018 at the New Delhi home of senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge. There were four senior Chhattisgarh Congress leaders present, none of them pleased.They should have been. In assembly results four days earlier, the Congress had swept to power in the state for the first time in 15 years in a landslide, winning 68 of 90 seats.And yet, there sat one leader, announced to the room as Chief Minister (CM) who would lose the post a few hours later; another who reluctantly settled for Speaker; and two others who refused the leadership of the first, and would in the immediate future, thrash out an unprecedented, if clumsy, two-and-a-half year power-sharing arrangement.And that is the cornerstone of the conflict between CM Bhupesh Baghel and Health Minister TS Singh Deo today.The roots of the crisisThe story of their leadership begins in tragedy, in May 2013, when the then Congress leadership in the state was wiped out in one of the most lethal Maoist attacks ever.Also Read | Dindori: As district gets added to India’s Maoist map, what it means for StateAs a Congress yatra made its way through the Darbha ghati in Bastar, an ambush ended the lives of state Congress stalwarts such as Nand Kumar Patel, Vidya Charan Shukla, Mahendra Karma and 24 others. Shorn of its biggest leaders, the reins of the party were handed over to Bhupesh Baghel and TS Singh Deo, then close confidantes.Elections, which took place in six months, proved too soon for a change, but in the five years between 2013 and 2018, Baghel was the aggressive state Congress chief, Singh Deo, the calm and suave leader of Opposition.As the November 2018 elections approached, and the sense that the Congress had a clear chance of uprooting the Raman Singh-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government for the first time in 15 years grew, the signs of distance began to show. Baghel and Singh Deo operated largely separate from each other.Baghel was aggressive, taking on Raman Singh for alleged corruption repeatedly, and even playing a hand in the removal of Ajit Jogi, the first Congress CM from the party. His tenure was nothing if not controversial, even going to jail for three days for allegedly circulating a distributing an alleged fake sex CD of the BJP PWD minister Rajesh Munat.Singh Deo, on the other hand, was quieter, many argue sometimes too quiet in taking on the BJP, but spending time in the creation of an ambitious “Janghoshna Patra” (People’s manifesto) that was built by criss crossing the state, and focusing on his stronghold in north Chhattisgarh.The post-election battle in RaipurCut to December 2018, and the Congress had decimated the BJP, sweeping 68 of 90 seats. Those for Baghel argued that he had led the party in the face of the 2013 crisis, and aggressively taken on Raman Singh and the BJP. Singh Deo aides spoke of the role the manifesto had played, how often it was cited among the people, and the Congress sweep in north Chhattisgarh.The battlelines had been drawn. The central Congress leadership then seemed to begin an experiment in deciding leadership. Observer Mallikarjun Kharge arrived in Raipur, and went straight to Babylon Hotel, where every victorious member of the legislative assembly (MLA) was waiting.As crowds jostled downstairs, shouting slogans, even breaking a glass door in the melee, in the rooms upstairs, Kharge, and general secretaries PL Punia, Chandan Yadav and Arun Oraon began an exercise. They asked each MLA whose leadership they backed, with the other option leaving it to the high command. At another level, calls went out to party workers, asking the same question, seeking responses on the “Shakti App.” Many MLA’s just left it to the High command, but as the exercise ended, most in the Chhattisgarh Congress felt that it was Singh Deo who had taken the lead.For two days, as the Congress struggled to put out fires despite victory in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, seen as much trickier — given both the narrower margins of victory, and the stature of the competing leaders in Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot, and Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia — Chhattisgarh waited.The Delhi formula By December 14, four leaders, Baghel, Singh Deo, old warhorse and former state Congress chief Charandas Mahant, and central OBC wing president Tamradhwaj Sahu were called to Delhi.Each had one-on-one meetings with both Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi. By the afternoon, it became clear that neither Baghel and Singh Deo were relenting, even as crowds thronged their Raipur and Durg homes, waiting for news. Mahant had settled for speaker, but at the home of Kharge then, a decision was announced, with a box of ladoos on the table. Sahu, who had spent most of his five years in Delhi had snuck ahead to be the party’s choice. Baghel and Singh Deo were stunned, and did not accept the decision. The ladoos, it is said, remained untouched.Ruffled by their lack of acceptance, the four were called back to the residence of Rahul Gandhi, and it was here that the power sharing deal was thrashed out. Gandhi reportedly conveyed that Sahu had been made CM because his two leading candidates had reached an impasse. Prodded on by their close confidantes, Baghel and Singh Deo spoke for the first time, and came up with a solution.Singh Deo presented a scenario where he would take power for two years initially, and Baghel for the next three, with the next elections being fought under Baghel. Faced with the prospect of Sahu being CM, Baghel acquiesced, but wanted to go first. Gandhi reportedly stepped in, and nixed the two and three idea, arguing for a split two-and-a-half year term each. The question then became who would go first, with Gandhi and Punia among those that deliberated, and eventually that role went to Baghel.Central to that decision was the argument that Chhattisgarh has a large population of OBCs and with Lok Sabha elections in six months, it would do well for the party to have an OBC leader at the helm.Singh Deo’s side argued that while there may be OBCs in Chhattisgarh, they are scattered, and don’t vote on caste lines, pointing to a Thakur leader in Raman Singh winning three terms, and that Chhattisgarh was, at its core, a tribal state.Six months later, despite the thumping assembly victory, the Congress won only two of eleven Lok Sabha seats. Its biggest margin of loss was in Durg, by close to 400,000 votes, home to its OBC chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and OBC Home Minister Tamradhwaj Sahu.The persistent friction Saddled by this two-and-a-half year arrangement at the top of their minds, the relationship between Baghel and Singh Deo, now health minister, has never mended. The closer one is to Chhattisgarh, the stronger the sense of friction, despite claims of “collective leadership”.While the disagreements have been quieter than ones in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, in Chhattisgarh, there have been many examples of the simmering anger, with Baghel accused of not inviting Singh Deo to health department meetings. In that time, Baghel has built a national profile, campaigning in Uttar Pradesh and most recently in Assam, even going door to door. Within the state, the power balance has seemingly shifted too, towards Baghel, with a focus on a “Chhattisgarhiya” son of the soil identity. Baghel has become a loud and reocgnisable voice, often frequenting national media events, and strongly putting forth the Congress stance.And yet, not everything has been perfect. In May, four tribals in Bastar died in alleged police firing in Silger, and in the protests in the aftermath, human rights activists Jean Dreze and Bela Bhatia alleged that they were prevented from going to the spot. There have also been allegations of a reduction in a proposed area of an elephant reserve at the altar of mining, something Singh Deo has objected to.By June 17, the day the two and a half year term deadline was passed, the voices of disagreement had only become louder. Recently, Singh Deo walked out of the state assembly, with Baghel sitting inside, irked at the lack of a government response denouncing allegations by Baghel loyalist Brihaspati Singh that he had engineered an attack on his vehicle. Singh Deo only returned to the assembly after an apology was issued, and none other than Tamradhwaj Sahu issued a statement.Will the deal be implemented? Two months later, saddled with a clumsy power-sharing agreement that was ill designed, the future is still unclear. Last week, in meetings with both leaders, it seemed like that the Congress leadership wanted Baghel to honour the agreement, and a defiant CM returned to Raipur, alleging that those who spoke of such an arrangement would never succeed.Baghel then returned to Delhi on Friday morning, with more than 40 MLAs in tow, for a second meeting. In another marathon conversation with Rahul Gandhi, and this time Priyanka Gandhi too, he seems to have accrued an advantage by pointing to his tenure as CM, and of course, his supporters bringing back the argument that his OBC identity was an asset. Emerging out of the meeting, Baghel said he had put “all issues” in front of his leader, and he had invited Rahul Gandhi to Chhattisgarh next week, “as Chief Minister”.Singh Deo’s argument has been constant. That Baghel’s chief ministership was premised on the deal, and he would simply like it honoured. His aides argue that unlike Pilot and Scindia, he has dealt with his marginalisation with dignity, and rarely spoken out of turn.When he returned to Raipur on Sunday, to a quieter welcome than the jubilant scenes of Baghel’s triumphant welcome in the morning, Singh Deo said that “everything” had been discussed and the decision “had been kept safe for now”.For the Congress, the leadership can either take the position that the promise must be enforced and send the message to its leaders that it will live up to its word. Conversely, it could take the position that Baghel has grown into his role and that a change midway, no matter what promise, sends a poor message. Either way, the continuing silence from the Delhi leadership, and two leaders hanging on to hope, will only further cleave the party from within.While there is no immediate danger to the government with the numbers it has at its command, there will be an election to fight in a little over two years. Even as a surprisingly subdued state BJP watches from a distance, the notion that even in a state where the mandate is clear and the leaders are no behemoths, the Congress is incapable of keeping its house in order, will only grow stronger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/chhattisgarh-the-inside-story-of-the-bhupesh-baghel-ts-singh-deo-battle-101630318304804.html
30-08-2021||News||Dindori: As district gets added to India’s Maoist map, what it means for State||Fitari is quiet. The kind of quiet that can only exists in a village in the middle of a Sal forest, its people from a tribe famously reclusive. A thin black tarred road snakes its way to the village, cutting through the Maikal hills, and two small rivulets. As a vehicle passes, the children scatter and the adults stop and stare. Most watch with surprise. The sound of an engine, or the voices of outsiders are still rare.But there is now wariness in those eyes too. For uniformed visitors, both Maoists and the police, have become increasingly frequent. And for villages in Dindori, now on the country’s Maoist map, that can only mean trouble.In July this year, the Union home ministry revised its list of districts affected by Left Wing Extremism across the country, bringing them down from 90 to 70. In every affected state, except one, the number of districts either stayed the same, or came down. The only addition, Madhya Pradesh’s Dindori.Also Read | Climate risk maps can mitigate the crisis and protect vulnerable livesThe list has also seen Chhattisgarh’s Mungeli district replacing Balod, which shares a border with Dindori, and the already declared Kabirdham district.For security agencies, this is an admission that a decade long expansion project of the Maoists into these parts, first spotted in 2012, called the MMC (Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh confluence) zone requires focussed attention.For 17-year-old Maha Singh Dhruv, the classification brings no solace, just a sense of dread, of the uncertainty and fear impending conflict bring.“For the last year, I fear entering the forest thinking that if someday they (Maoists) meet me and ask for help, what will I do? I will have to help them because they carry weapons and if I do, the police will ask a hundred questions,” Dhruv said.Dhruv is a Baiga, who form more than 80% of the population in Fitari, which has a population of 500 voters. The tribe, famously reclusive, are one of the 75 notified Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTG) in the country, and one of the seven notified in Madhya Pradesh.The government defines PVTG’s as “tribal communities who have declining or stagnant population, low level of literacy, pre-agricultural level of technology and are economically backward”.Also Read | Climate crisis: India now confronts a droughtDhruv lost his father very young, and lives in small one room hut with his mother. He went to school in the village itself, but dropped out when his father died. Like with everyone else in the village, there is no income, only subsistence. There is paddy that grows seasonally in two acres of land, and a small kitchen garden where there are long stalks of maize. The rest, the forest has always provided for. But now, with the peace beginning to break, Dhruv wants to leave. “I want to leave this place now. I need a job in Dindori town, 80 kilometres away,” Dhruv said.The mechanics of identification The police focus is on three police station areas in Dindori district, Samnapur, Bajag and Karanjiya. The village has electricity but no mobile towers, and to make a phone call, the few who have phones climb up to specific areas atop hills where the signal bar on the handset flickers on.Senior police officials told HT that earlier this year, they were given inputs of a team of Maoists attempting to speak to villagers in Fitari. Silence is perhaps the best escape and Dhule Baiga has an answer everyone else does too. “I know nothing,” he says.Sanjay Singh, superintendent of police, Dindori, said the movement and interaction that the police have noticed in the area, have been in and around 65 villages, mostly in “Baiga Chak”.In 1890, the then colonial government had notified “Baiga Chak” as an area that the Baigas lived in, where they would practice shifting agriculture, locally called “Bewar”. The residents would burn patches of forests and then sow seeds with the government instead training them to practice “settled farming”. At the time, the Baiga Chak had seven villages, but the term is now commonly used to refer to 52 villages, both in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.Also Read | A leap in India’s vaccine driveBut even if villagers are afraid to talk of the increase presence of Maoists, the police argue that there are clear indications of a growing presence. In 2018, four kilometres away from Fetari, in the biggest local market in Dhurkuta, where everything from an umbrella to spices is sold, a driver spotted a group of 28 armed cadres crossing the forests. “I remember it was a chilly morning and I was returning from a marriage in Dhurkuta. I counted them. Initially , I thought they were police personnel but later because they were very cautious, I realised that they are Maoists,” said the driver, tracked down by HT, who lives in Chhattisgarh’s Kabhirdham, bordering Dindori.Acting on this information, the police had at the time, sent teams to the village and found telltale footprints at the spot the driver had mentioned. “I tried to ask the villagers but most said nothing. Only one elderly Baiga told me that he saw those people twice walking outside the village,” a local police officer said.Officers of the Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh Police, who have interrogated surrendered cadres that worked in the MMC zone in the last three years believe that the Maoists are developing a new ‘base area’ in the dense Amarkantak forests. Amarkantak is where the Vindhya, Maikal and Satpura ranges converge in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.In 2012, the Central Committee of the CPI (Maoist) decided to form this new zone, apart from the one already operational in Bastar called the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC). Documents accessed by the police show that by 2017, the work of “social investigation” was completed by “vistar platoons” covering more than 500 villages in the area. This survey included analysis of demography, target population, economic status, employment, and socio-economic problems of the area along with the identification of safe routes for the movement of armed cadres. The aim is to create another “Abhujhmaad”, which is a 4000 square kilometre area in south Bastar, unmapped by the government, and known to be the area where members of the Central Committee of the CPI(Maoist) live and operate from.Also Read | In Kabul, India’s twin agendaIn their conversations, surrendered cadres have told police that the Maoists have surveyed the forests to map water bodies, high vantage points to watch the movement of troops and police stations in a bid to create a safe zone. The team responsible for developing this passage and base area is headed by Maoist commander Rakesh Ode, originally from Gadchiroli, who heads a team of 22 armed cadres. Rakesh heads three Area Committees of CPI (Maoist) – Bhoramdeo, Bodla and Khatiamocha and reports to Kabeer who heads the Kanha Bhoramdeo (KB) division of the MMC zone. Police records show that there are a total of 85 armed cadres operating in the area, of which 34 are women.The beginning of a vicious cycle? The increase in the Maoist presence is also throwing up a familiar, hotly contested argument, one that has caused much strife in areas such as Bastar. The Dindori police plan to set up four new police camps in the area, at Chauradadar, Padaripani, Chada and Gaurakanhari, all in Baiga Chak. In Dhurkuta, this plan worries Arjun Singh Dhruv, president of the Baiga Nritak Dal and a retired teacher. “I don’t know about Maoists and their presence in this area, but one thing is concerning for us – our freedom. When the forces will be deployed, we will be caged,” Dhruv said.Dhruv said that Baiga culture has very little crime, close to no theft, so much so that there are very few homes that even own a lock. “The nearest police station, Bajag is 28 km from this village but when the police from outside (referring to paramilitary personnel) come to this area they definitely intrude into our daily lives, and can harass us,” he said.Dr Vijay Chaurasia, a homeopathy doctor based in Baiga Chak, and author of the book “Prakriti Putra Baiga” shares similar concerns and said that it took him close to a decade to win the confidence of the Baigas. “If the Maoists are talking to Baigas and trying to enter this peaceful community, they are actually harming them. But the government decision to deploy forces in this area makes this tribe venerable. This is bad move,” he said.But Ved Ram Hanote, Station House Officer of the Bajag police station has already spotted signs of a shift in stance and vocabulary in some sections of the population. “We have information that some people, possibly Maoists, are entering remote villages of Baiga Chak and encouraging the residents to encroach forest land for cultivation. To me it seems that the language of Baigas has changed, they have a new vocabulary where some are talking about rights and laws. Rights and laws are not bad in themselves, just that the change in words tells me that a new influence has seeped in,” Hanote said.Although there has been no recorded Maoist violence in Dindori, the district police believe that the villages inside the forest of Dindori are now a “safe area” for Maoists. In March 2021, a massive anti-Maoist operation was launched by the Mandla police where, under fire, the Maoists escaped towards Dindori and settled there for about a week. “They travel along a river called Kharmer, which borders two states every time they feel pressure in Chhattisgarh or Mandla,” said the Dindori SP, adding that the state government had been trying to include Dindori in MHA’s list for last two years.He said that he hoped that the Baigas being reclusive would stem the spread of Maoist influence, but hidden in that, is a double edged sword. “They rarely entertain outsiders and therefore the chances of widespread Maoist influence is less. But if the Maoists do manage this, then it would be really difficult for us because they rarely say anything to the police,” said Singh.Also Read | The art of mediating conflictsThe district plans to deploy all Baiga policemen in these areas, who will aid the paramilitary in their operations, and attempt to “keep a check on them”. The plan is to deploy 400 central forces, but augment them with 550 district police personnel. “We have started training officers to prevent any harassment in the region. The behaviour of police must change while working in these tribal dominated areas; otherwise the Maoists could take advantage and we will lose the trust of the community,” said the SP.However, within the state apparatus, there is no unanimity on what is clearly a complicated question. Intelligence officials HT has spoken to said that the large number of deployments themselves may be what the Maoists want the state to do. “I think that the Maoists want such a deployment of police forces because this will make tribes feel threatened and in turn, they create ideological space for themselves. What is need of such a huge deployment? These villages are merely a passage of Maoists towards Amarkantak. Baigas don’t like uniformed people and hence it could be dangerous,” an officer posted in the region said.The Chhattisgarh dimension In Chhattisgarh’s neighbouring Mungeli district, also newly added to the list of Maoist districts by the MHA, around 50 villages of the Khudiya post in Lormi, are being watched closely by the state. Police functionaries said that all of these are Baiga dominated villages and more than ten “interactions” have been recorded in the past year. Remote and sparsely populated, these villages get cut off in the monsoon.“My brother lives in Aurapani and guards a small rest house there. He told me that about a year ago , four people in black uniforms came and asked him several questions about and topography. They enter our village from Ajgar Pahad in Mungeli,” said Chamran Singh Baiga, who once lived in Aurapanu, but has since moved to Mahuamacha village.A senior police officer, posted in Chhattisgarh’s capital of Raipur said Mungeli has developed into an area of strategic importance for the MMC zone. “We have included the district in our list Khudiya outpost is the entrance point of their base area –the Amarkantak forests. If they get support or recruitment from the villages alongside, it will be very difficult to contain them in next few years,” said the officer.Chhattisgarh DGP DM Awasthi said the state wanted to be careful with its planning and deployment and not exacerbate a sensitive situation. “In 2018, Kabirdham was added in MHAs list and now we have decided to add Mungeli. The reason is simple, Maoists are expanding MMC zone towards Amarakant and it is important to check them. We are still thinking about deployment and based on intelligence inputs decisions will be taken,” Awasthi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/dindori-as-district-gets-added-to-india-s-maoist-map-what-it-means-for-state-101630298322778.html

The police control room (PCR) force, which has a strength of 350, is expected to be on duty the whole day, following which they are allowed rest. Many say that the long and hectic working hours have taken a toll on their physical and mental health, and they are unable to take out time for themselves or their families.A PCR personnel, on the condition of anonymity, said, “As our shift lasts the whole day, our sleep cycles have been disturbed. When the PCR motorcycle squad was launched, we used to work in eight-hour shifts, then we were asked to stretch for 12 hours and now, it has been extended to 24-hours.”“We barely have any time for our families and social life is also affected. We can hardly attend family functions, weddings etc. The situation is worse for police personnel whose families stay in other districts,” said the cop.Police commissioner Naunihal Singh said that PCR teams are overworked and they are working to ease duty hours for these personnel.The Ludhiana police commissionerate has 30 patrolling vans, including a Maruti Suzuki Ertiga, Mahindra Bolero and Chevrolet Tavera and 80 motorcycles. A total of 350 police personnel are deputed in PCR teams, who work in teams of two.Six litres of fuel for PCR vansPCR vans get only six litres of fuel for one shift of patrolling, while the motorcycles teams get two litres of petrol for 24 hours. PCR personnel said that as the mileage of cars is less, they need for more fuel as they have to keep moving all the time. Sometimes, they end up paying for fuel from their own pockets.Police personnel dies of cardiac arrest on dutyA police personnel, head constable Jaswant Singh, 53, who was deputed at police post Jagatpuri had died of cardiac arrest while on duty on Sunday night.

Currently, the 16-lane ROB near Lal Kuan, a major intersection in Ghaziabad, has only four lanes active, forcing commuters to brave long snarls during rush hours. The ROB is part of phase 2 (UP Gate to Dasna) of the DME that was thrown open for commuters in April this year. According to official estimates, the UP Gate-Dasna stretch has movement of about 60,000 passenger car units per day.“With the opening of six more lanes of the ROB, the total constructed lanes will be 10. But we will use two of these for completing the pending work. In all, the commuters will now get eight lanes with four each side. This will considerably reduce the traffic jams,” said Mudit Garg, project director, NHAI. “We have completed the load tests and installation of signages for the new six lanes. The work for the remaining six lanes is likely to be completed by December this year,” Garg added. The under-construction ROB is a major roadblock for traffic under the 19.2km of DME’s phase 2. “Whenever commuters get stuck in jams, they find ways down the DME to the side lanes. Many try to drive on wrong side as well. The situation becomes worse during monsoon,” said Pradeep Kumar, a resident of Vijay Nagar. The ROB is located close to the border of Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar and witnesses heavy traffic of commercial vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/relief-for-commuters-as-nhai-to-open-6-more-lanes-of-chipiyana-rob-101630346864348.html

NCRTC is the implementing agency.“The work on five stations of the priority stretch has advanced. One of the vital features of all stations in RRTS corridor is that the infrastructure will be compatible with the requirement of medical emergencies. The elevators will be of high capacity and spacious enough to accommodate stretchers and patients and taken through different levels up and down the train level,” said Puneet Vats, chief public relations officer of NCRTC. “The space inside the high-speed trains will also be able to accommodate stretchers and patients. Once the network is complete, patients will not have to change trains or stations to move from one end of National Capital Region (NCR) to the other.”The NCRTC is also implementing two other networks — a 160km link between Delhi and Alwar and 103km link between Delhi and Panipat.With this, patients from Meerut to, say the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi, can catch a train from there to the proposed Safdarjung station on the upcoming Delhi-Alwar route in 60 minutes.Officials familiar with the development said that the network will serve as an alternative “green corridor” that is put in place by clearing traffic to transport critical patients or organs over road.Another NCRTC official said that the buildings of the five stations on the priority section — Sahibabad, Ghaziabad, Guldhar, Duhai and Duhai depot — will be visible by 2022.“The work is progressing fast at the Ghaziabad station (near the New Bus Adda metro station), and it will be the highest of all the stations on the 82km route at a height of about 24 metres from the ground and above the Delhi Metro’s Red Line alignment. Its foundation and pier work are complete and work for installation of cross-arm structures is on now. On these cross-arms, different pre-cast levels of station building will be placed,” said an official from NCRTC. “The work to install cross-arms at Sahibabad and Guldhar are also on, while the pier work is ongoing at the Duhai and Duhai Depot stations.”The RRTS project between Delhi and Meerut is pegged at ₹30,274 crore. The actual operational speed of the trains under the network will be 160kmph, while their average speed will be close to 100kmph.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/rrts-stations-trains-to-be-made-ready-for-medical-emergencies-101630346863711.html
30-08-2021||Other||Ghaziabad: QR codes on electric poles to check power theft||In a move to check faults and power theft, the Ghaziabad division of power distribution company – the Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) – has started putting up location-tagged quick response (QR) codes on all electric poles and transformers in the district.According to discom officials, PVVNL teams can scan QR codes with their devices to gauge how much power was drawn from a pole or transformer. If there is a mismatch, the company can now pinpoint where the leak is, they said.The chief engineer of PVVNL (Ghaziabad division), Pankaj Srivastava, said they have begun the process of putting up QR codes on every pole. “An independent agency was hired to put up stickers on all 280 transformers and over 250,000 poles in the district,” he said.The discom has long been suffering from aggregate technical & commercial (AT&C) losses that have put a dent on its revenue. While technical losses include faults in the system, commercial losses are those due to billing issues and thefts. The annual AT&C loss in Ghaziabad is nearly 17% of the power purchased by the discom, said Srivastava.“With the help of this new system, we can easily monitor areas reporting greatest AT&C losses and reduce the gap between the input we receive from power generation companies and the supply for which the payment is made to us, will be reduced,” he said.The chief engineer said the new system will also make the billing process more transparent. “The accumulative consumption of power by the consumers will be matched with the units drawn from transformers of the areas concerned. If it is alarmingly low or high, the meter readers will be held accountable,” he said.Under the system, Srivastava said, an electric pole will automatically send alerts to control room in case it detects a fault. “The system is such that if a fault is detected, it will automatically shut power in that location and alert the control room. Our enforcement wing can easily launch a crackdown against power thieves this way and correct faults,” he said.Archana Lal, who resides in Vasundhara’s Sector 1, said the new system is supposed to give respite from frequent power outages in her area. “The moment power theft is checked, the power blues will be minimised. The new system will also give relief from the low-voltage problem, particularly in the evening hours,” she said.BP Singh, a Indirapuram resident, said that after installing unique QR codes on the transformers and poles, the casual approach of meter readers will also be stopped. “They often make readings on the trial-and-error basis. The new system will definitely bring transparency in the billing system,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ghaziabad-qr-codes-on-electric-poles-to-check-power-theft-101630346684765.html

30-08-2021||Gurugram||Leachate samples collected from Bandhwari landfill found to be toxic||Samples of leachate collected from the Bandhwari landfill in the second week of August were found to contain chemicals in excess of the permissible limits as well as toxic substances, according to the results of the tests released by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) last week.The samples were collected from three sites, including the outlet of a leachate treatment plant, and ponds that had formed outside the landfill and on forest land in the vicinity. Vaishali Rana Chandra, a city-based environmentalist who had complained about the issue to the pollution control board on August 10, said, “Untreated leachate is being discharged in the jungle, which the report clearly shows is highly toxic. This is a damning report on the basis of which Ecogreen’s contract should be suspended immediately.”However, officials of Ecogreen Energy, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram’s concessionaire for waste management at Bandhwari landfill, said that these levels were found in leachate and not the water released after treatment. He said that they have also fixed a broken wall through which leachate spilt outside due to excessive rainfall.Sanjeev Sharma, the spokesperson for Ecogreen Energy, said, “These high levels of COD [chemical oxygen demand], BOD [biological oxygen demand] and other elements have been found in leachate water and not the treated water released from the plant. Our Disc Tube Reverse Osmosis (DTRO) system used to treat leachate is working properly and the samples collected from there are all as per the norms.”On August 10, officials had denied that the pond outside the landfill contained leachate and said that it was accumulated rainwater.According to the report, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), zinc, chloride, fluoride were all found to be significantly higher than permissible norms. The BOD level of the samples collected from a pond inside the forest area was 540 mg/l, while the COD was 1680 mg/l, chloride was 420mg/l and fluoride was 1mg/l. The BOD level of the samples collected from the outlet of leachate treatment plant was 520 mg/l, while the COD was 1640 mg/l. The BOD level for samples collected from a leachate pond was 640 mg/l and COD level was 1780 mg/l. For treated leachate, the BOD level was 12 mg/l while COD was 64mg/l. Experts said that elements such as fluoride, even in minuscule quantities, can be harmful as it affects bones in the human body. According to Central Pollution Control Board norms, BOD for a river or waterbody should be less than 30mg/l and COD should be less than 250 mg/l. The report also mentions that elements traces of nickel and lead were not detected in the samples, despite battery waste (which contains lead) being dumped in the area. “The HSPCB report states that heavy metals like lead and chromium were not detected in the leachate samples. Even a layman can infer that this would be a gross anomaly as it is impossible to not have these two elements in the leachate being released from mixed municipal waste consisting of batteries, phones, electric wires. Heavy metals are detected even in drinking water at times,” a letter sent by three city-based environmentalists to the chief secretary of Haryana stated. Vinod Kumar Mogha, an independent consultant working on environmental projects, after an analysis of the report, said, “First, both BOD and COD being on the extremely higher side is extremely toxic; then fluoride is so harmful that it can melt one’s bones. It should not have been detected in the sample, but it is, again, on the higher side. The report is contradictory as battery wastage is dumped in the same area, but it has not been detected.” “These elements are signs that the whole area is contaminated and any vegetation growing on that soil will also have these substances,” he said. A senior official of the pollution control board, who did not wish to be named, said, “We have released the report, but we are yet to look into it in detail. At present, work is being done for the public hearing scheduled for Tuesday, where people can raise their concerns.” A public hearing has been scheduled by HSPCB to discuss concerns over setting up a waste-to-energy plant at the landfill site. Residents have been protesting against the plan on the grounds that it could endanger the ecologically sensitive forest land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/leachate-samples-collected-from-bandhwari-landfill-found-to-be-toxic-101630346268087.html

Employees from multiple departments handling Covid-19 duties have been directed to check the implementation of Mahamari Alert-Surakshit Haryana and take actions accordingly,” said Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner.The state administration on Monday circulated a message on the official WhatsApp group of the district administration, advising officials to regulate gatherings and ensure proper follow-up of patients in home isolation. According to Garg, the administration will continue to comply with the Mahamari Alert- Surakshit Haryana guidelines of the state administration, which was last revised on August 22. Under the guidelines, gatherings in indoor spaces are allowed with a 50% cap on the hall capacity, whereas 200 people are allowed to gather in open spaces. Religious places are allowed to host 50 people at a go, as per the guidelines.Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “As directed by the state health department, teams will continue to follow up with home-isolated patients to prevent transmission of infection and cluster formation.”Currently, the district has been reporting a constant decline in daily cases. The district on Monday reported at least five new cases of the coronavirus infection. Sixty-six positive cases are currently active, of whom 58 are in home isolation and eight are hospitalised. Weekly cases over the past month have declined dramatically, from almost 52 in the first week of August to nearly 20 new cases last week. However, Garg said that despite a decline in cases, they do not want to take any risks.On Monday, as the city celebrated the Janmasthmi festival, many temples across the city received low footfall during the morning hours. The Shri Krishna temple in Sector 4 was closed during the morning hours, and when it opened in the evening, a limited number of people were allowed inside at a time. The Prem temple on Old Railway Road also received a low footfall in the morning.Subhash Boken, spokesperson, Gurugram police, said, “Adequate police force will be deployed if we notice gathering in any market area or at any religious place to regulate the crowd.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/coronavirus-cases-may-rise-restrict-gatherings-state-tells-district-admin-101630346266836.html
30-08-2021||Gurugram||Tree plantation target unlikely to be reached by MCG this year||Even as the monsoon season is at its later stages, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has so far been unable to plant saplings in at least eight of its wards. Officials said that their target to plant 300,000 saplings this season is likely to be completed by March 2022.Prior to the start of the monsoon season in June, the MCG had set a target of planting 300,000 saplings in an official release. However, the MCG started the plantation drive only in August and has recalled tenders for planting saplings in at least eight of its wards, including wards 1, 2, 3, 31, 32, 33, 34, and 35.Officials said that bids for the eight wards will be opened only on September 4, after which a contractor will be finalised and planting of saplings will commence. Even for the other 27 wards, MCG floated tenders in mid-August for planting saplings and subsequently, maintaining them. Subhash Yadav, the district forest officer (DFO), who is also the additional chief executive officer of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and the nodal officer of the MCG’s environment and sustainability wing, said that the civic body is lagging behind its target due to a change in strategy.“Previously, the MCG was not accounting or keeping records of the saplings it had planted. This year, we decided to involve private contractors in this project so that there is higher accountability and to increase the survival rate of the saplings, due to which there is a delay in the plantation process. However, this process will have long-term benefits,” said Yadav.Yadav said that while the MCG is likely to plant around 200,000 shrubs by this monsoon, plantation of around 100,000 trees would be completed by March next year.“Around 90-95% (of the target) for planting shrubs would be achieved by this monsoon season. We are aiming to complete planting remaining shrubs, along with around 60,000 tree saplings, in February-March next year,” said Yadav.Environmentalists said that the conditions of contracts with private contractors should be stringent to ensure proper maintenance of saplings.“The MCG needs to ensure that it mentions the number of times the contractor has to water the saplings in a month as well as list the repercussions for failing to do so. Most saplings need to be watered at least on a weekly basis and the MCG needs to ensure the same is maintained for the survival of shrubs and trees,” said Vaishali Rana Chandra, a city-based environmentalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/tree-plantation-target-unlikely-to-be-reached-by-mcg-this-year-101630346265619.html
30-08-2021||Delhi||Suspect in Jantar Mantar hate sloganeering case, to surrender to cops on Tuesday||Days after the Delhi high court declined to give interim protection from arrest to Hindu Raksha Dal chief Bhupinder Tomar alias Pinky Chaudhary for his alleged involvement in raising hate slogans at Jantar Mantar on August 8, a video emerged on social media on Monday in which the right-wing activist could be heard saying that he will surrender at the Connaught Place police station on Tuesday noon. Chaudhary has been evading arrest ever since a case for promoting enmity between different groups and defying Covid-19 guidelines was registered on August 8, hours after videos of an event — which the organisers claimed was held that day near Jantar Mantar to push for the abolition of “colonial-era laws” — showed people shouting anti-Muslim slogans. After the videos were widely circulated on social media, several activists filed police complaints, prompting the police to conduct raids and arrest the alleged perpetrators. The new 1.37-minute video clip has Chaudhary standing against a wall with a saffron cloth wrapped around his shoulders. “…I am still firm on my point that neither I nor any worker of my organisation did anything wrong at Jantar Mantar. I respect the court. I will get myself arrested tomorrow, on August 31, around 12pm at Connaught Place police station and will cooperate with police during the probe,” Chaudhary could be heard saying in the video.HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the video, which appears to have been shot inside a temple, as a bell could be heard tolling while Chaudhary speaks. “I never run away from being arrested. It is the right of every person to go to court and I did the same. I want to tell you that all the allegations against me are false and baseless. My life has been devoted to Hinduism and Hindutva. As long as I breathe, I will continue to do the work of religion. Every Hindu citizen should support me and take our movement forward. I am not scared of going to jail,” Chaudhary said in the video. On being asked about the video and Chaudhary’s latest statement, joint commissioner of police (New Delhi range) Jaspal Singh said, “As per the provisions of the law, any person wanted in any case can surrender before the police or court. Our teams have been conducting raids to arrest Chaudhary.”Police have said that they didn’t grant permission to the August 8 event called by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ashwini Upadhyay under the banner of ‘Bharat Jodo Andolan’ (literally, ‘unite India movement’). Upadhyay, a former Delhi BJP spokesperson, was arrested along with seven others. He is out on bail at present and claims that no inflammatory slogans were raised that day. On Friday, the Delhi high court had refused to grant interim protection from arrest to Chaudhary. On August 21, a sessions court had dismissed Chaudhary’s anticipatory bail plea too, saying, “We are not a Taliban state and the rule of law is the sacrosanct governing principle in our plural and multicultural society.”Police have so far arrested eight people in connection with the case, most of them associated with various right-wing outfits: Uttam Upadhyay, Ashwini Upadhyay, Preet Singh, Deepak Singh, Deepak Kumar, Vinod Sharma, Vinit Bajpai and Sushil Tiwari. Preet Singh is the director of ‘Save India Foundation’, one of the organisers of the August 8 march, while Sushil Tiwari is the chief of Hindu Army.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/will-surrender-to-cops-on-tuesday-pinky-chaudhary-suspect-in-jantar-mantar-hate-sloganeering-case-says-in-video-101630346264267.html
30-08-2021||Delhi||Portable mohalla clinics envisioned for JJ colonies, dense areas in Delhi||The Delhi government is constructing two mohalla clinics inside portable shipping containers in the city's Shakurbasti area, which the authorities plan to replicate in dense cluster colonies where creating health infrastructure in a dedicated building is a challenge owing to space constraints.The Delhi government opted for this model in order to tide over the issues of land posed by DDA and civic bodies, Health Minister Satyendar Jain said."Land is a subject that comes under the Centre. Politics has been happening with the construction of mohalla clinics. DDA had promised in the Delhi High Court that it would give land for mohalla clinics but it did not given us anything for even a single mohalla clinic."The municipal corporations has also been troubling us. What we did was that we took a shipping container and prepared a readymade mohalla clinic," he told reporters.Mohalla clinics is one of the flagship initiatives of the Kejriwal government to boost the primary healthcare system in Delhi.A typical mohalla clinic has a doctor and a midwife-cum-nurse. It provides an array of diagnostic services and essential medicines free of cost.Jain had earlier visited the sites of two mohalla clinics being constructed in giant containers in Shakurbasti and took stock of the situation. The clinics in these containers would also be fully air-conditioned."Visited the construction site of 2 new Mohalla Clinics at Shakurbasti. These Clinics have been set up in portable containers. Such Clinics are easy to set up & transport in Cluster areas like Jhuggi-Bastis & narrow streets where healthcare infrastructure is less accessible," he tweeted after his visit.Talking about the new version of mohalla clinic, Jain said these are being made by a company as part of its CSR activity. Mohalla clinics were also made inside porta cabins at some places."These are 100 per cent transferable, and can be installed wherever there is space. At present, we have one sample. I think the cost of these will be similar to the ones in porta cabins," he said.He said these will be a better option since they can made in bulk in a factory, can be installed within no time and are made of sturdy material."There were issues of thefts arising at mohalla clinics but these shipping containers are made of sturdy material and will be able to withstand the danger of thefts," he said.Jain said these will be put up at the Delhi government land. "The porta cabins were assembled on the site but these would be made in factories and then put up at the designated places. These would occupy lesser space."A mohalla clinic would be made in an area of 600 square feet but these will occupy 320 square feet. The idea behind their design is derived from an aeroplane, which is well-designed and has everything in a compact space. There are around 500 mohalla clinics currently functional in Delhi," he said.The AAP government had in February 2019 flagged off 16 bike ambulances, known as First Responder Vehicles (FRVs), in a district in east Delhi on pilot basis.The facilities available in FRV include a portable oxygen cylinder, a first aid kit and dressing materials, air-splints, foldable transfer sheets, ambu bags, glucometer, pulse oxymeter, a portable manual suction machine, a GPS device and a communication device.These FRVs are manned by trained ambulance manpower.Buoyed by the "overwhelmingly positive response" to the bike ambulance project in east Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in September 2019 had said plans were afoot to expand the service across the national capital."A large number of people in Delhi live in unauthorised colonies or other such areas where streets are very narrow. I was very concerned about how to provide better emergency healthcare to the people living in these colonies. With this in mind, the Bike Ambulance service was launched. The Delhi government is planning to extend the service to the entire city," he had said.Jain recently had opened a new mohalla clinic at Tis Hazari court.In January 2020, two months before the COVID-19 pandemic hit Delhi, Chief Minister Kejriwal had inaugurated 152 mohalla clinics en bloc.Earlier, Jain had said mohalla clinics help in keeping quacks away, as people have a facility to go to for simple ailments. The plan is to have such facilities as close to households as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/portable-mohalla-clinics-envisioned-for-jj-colonies-dense-areas-in-delhi-101630345673712.html

There has, however, been no flu-related death in the district, they added. “In our out-patient department (OPD), we are getting about 100 patients a day who report with high fever, runny nose, cough and other symptoms,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of Sanjay Nagar District Combined Hospital. “Of the 100, 40-45 are children. We ensure that patients coming with fever and other symptoms are tested for Covid as well. However, none has yet tested positive for Covid-19.”The fever generally subsided within 4-5 days, although in some cases, it took a few days longer, he added. “These days, viral fever cases are 10-20% of daily cases as against 2-4% on other days. We get our patients tested for Covid-19 as well as for H1N1 (swine flu) as a precaution,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad chapter). “It is vital to consult a doctor if one has fever and patients should get adequate hydration and nutrition besides taking bed rest.” The district surveillance officials said that they are keeping an eye on these cases. “It has been about a fortnight since fever cases started spiking and it could be due to seasonal changes. As a precautionary measure, we have asked hospitals to get fever patients tested for Covid as well,” said Dr Rakesh Gupta, district surveillance officer. He said there were seven Covid cases reported in the district on Monday, and these included two old cases which were transferred from Gautam Budh Nagar. “The other five cases are of two families who travelled together to Ladakh and tested positive for Covid-19 upon their return. Two of the five cases are of a family from Delhi while three cases are of a Ghaziabad family. We have directed for genome-sequencing of the three cases and have strictly asked them to stay in isolation,” Dr Gupta added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/cases-of-viral-fever-on-the-rise-in-ghaziabad-not-covid-say-doctors-101630345783723.html
30-08-2021||Delhi||Schools in Delhi told to involve parents in chalking out reopening plan||With the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) giving the go-ahead for the resumption of in-person learning from September 1 for students of classes 9 to 12, public and private schools have been directed by the authority to hold meetings with parent representatives to finalise their respective reopening plans.This is the first time that schools have been asked to involve parents in the decision-making process and engage them in confidence-building measures, including vaccination, among parents’ groups, stakeholders said.“Head of school/institute are also advised to convene SMC/PTA (school management committee/parent teacher association) meetings as and when required to review the compliance of Covid protocols, attendance of students, and other confidence-building measures,” the DDMA order on Monday said.Government school principal Sukhbir Singh Yadav, president of Vice- and Principals’ Association of Delhi, said the school would continue to hold in-depth engagements with school management committee members. “We have shared the latest guidelines with SMC members and we will be holding a meeting Tuesday to discuss issues,” said Yadav.But SMC members say not all of them have been informed of this. Rama Sengar, who is a member of the SMC at Shaheed Amir Chand Government Sarvodaya Vidyalaya (SAC GSV) in Civil Lines, said, “As of now, we have not been approached for any decision-making or meeting. We will be happy to share the concerns of parents.” Several private schools said they have been updating parents regularly and have routinely sought their feedback on key issues. Amit Chawla, a member of the parent body at KR Mangalam School, GK-2, said they will be holding a meeting on Tuesday to discuss the reopening. “We feel that the focus should be on vaccination. Vaccination is extremely crucial and the government should focus on vaccinating students as well,” he said.Many parents are also waiting to see how many of their concerns will be addressed. Aprajita Gautam, president of the Delhi Parents’ Association, said, “The government issues orders but eventually parents are left on their own. Even today, most parents we spoke to are not in favour of reopening schools.” She said authorities need to decide on what action would be taken against schools that are found flouting social distancing norms and other Covid-19 safety guidelines. The DDMA guidelines issued on Monday have capped the occupancy capacity of classrooms and laboratories at 50%, keeping in mind physical distancing needs. However, implementing this will be difficult for budget schools that have infrastructure constraints. Chandrakant Singh, national general secretary, Private Land Public School’s Trust, an association of budget schools, said, “While it will be challenging to accommodate students in schools with space constraints, reopening is important. Children in budget schools come from economically weaker sections and their parents don’t have smartphones or data bundles to aid digital learning. The government should consider reopening the primary sections as well.” Since schools have been asked to continue with online classes for those who wish to continue with that, principals said conducting classes in a blended mode was going to be challenging.Malini Narayanan, principal of Army Public School in Shankar Vihar, said, “Many schools do not have the infrastructure to conduct blended classes such as interactive panels and smart boards. In the absence of that, schools will be recording class sessions and sharing them with students.”In order to ensure the safety of all stakeholders, the National Progressive Schools Conference (NPSC) said its 122 member schools will only encourage vaccinated teaching and non-teaching staff to come to school. While the DDMA order has asked schools to ensure mandatory vaccination of bus drivers and other transportation staff, most schools said for now, they will not be resuming the school bus facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/schools-in-delhi-told-to-involve-parents-in-chalking-out-reopening-plan-101630345724709.html
30-08-2021||Delhi||Man impersonates as lawyer to join hearing in rape case at Rohini court, arrested||The police have arrested a man for impersonating a lawyer and appearing for a rape victim during a bail hearing in the Rohini Court on Saturday.During the hearing, the man, identified as Mukesh Kumar, began arguing in favour of the accused despite claiming to be representing the victim, which prompted the judge to ask the Bar Association to intervene. He was found out when he couldn’t furnish the Bar Association with a valid enrolment number.The police arrested him hours later, after the Association and the rape victim’s parents filed a complaint at the Prashant Vihar police station. The police said Kumar works as a lawyer’s assistant in Bihar and they are investigating if he has criminal antecedents. The matter was reported on Saturday during a bail hearing at the Rohini court for a man arrested on charges of rape in 2019. Apart from the accused man’s representation, lawyers from the government and the women’s commission were also in court during the hearing. Kumar introduced himself as the victim’s lawyer and claimed in court that the women’s commission and police were pressuring her to withdraw her complaint, and even said they were opposing the victim’s bail.He also claimed that the victim wanted the accused to get bail so that they can get married. Suspicious at his disjointed arguments, the judge hearing the case asked the Bar Association to intervene. Kumar’s impersonation came to light when he could not produce any valid identity documents, registration details or an enrolment number.It was then revealed that he used to work as an assistant to a lawyer in Bihar and bought a white shirt, black trousers and shoes from a showroom near the court on Saturday, after which he headed into a courtroom.The Prashant Vihar police registered an FIR on a complaint from the Bar Association and the victims’ family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-impersonates-as-lawyer-to-join-hearing-in-rape-case-at-rohini-court-arrested-101630345545455.html
30-08-2021||Delhi||With one more day still to go, UG registrations at Delhi University already cross 435,000||New Delhi: The Delhi University has received over 435,000 applications for around 70,000 seats in various undergraduate programmes till Monday, the highest so far, university officials said. The numbers are expected to go even higher with registrations continuing till Tuesday evening.Last year, the university received 351,974 paid applications in the three-month registration window that was 100,000 more than 2019 (258,388). To be sure, the registration portal was open for around 10 weeks in 2020, as compared to four weeks this year, in order to help students amid problems arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic.The first cut-off is expected to come out on October 1 and admissions to the undergraduate courses will begin on October 4, university officials said.Though there are over 435,000 registrations on the admissions portal so far, only around 250,000 among them are paid applications due to various factors, including duplicity and multiple registrations per candidate. University officials said the number of paid forms is expected to increase by Tuesday night as more candidates are expected to complete the process by paying the registration fee.This year, registrations for undergraduate courses began on August 2, and online registrations for the postgraduate, MPhil, and PhD courses took place between July 26 and August 21. The university received over 183,815 applications for 20,000 PG seats and 30,019 registrations for MPhil/PhD slots.A senior university official who asked not to be named said, “Students can pay the registration fee till 11.59pm Tuesday. Only the paid applications will be considered. We did not extend the registration date as we have to submit data for the undergraduate entrance test as well. This week, the university officials are likely to hold a meeting with the admissions committee to discuss the suggestions put forward by the principals on cut-offs.”The official added that the university would have continued with the merit-based admissions had it not been for the scheduled entrance tests. “Along with engineering and medical entrance exams, we also have the undergraduate DU entrance test (DUET) scheduled for the last week of September. The admission process is dependent on these tests because students tend to change their academic choices based on their performance in the tests. This is why we chose October 1 as the date for tentative cut-off,” the official added.Since DU does not follow a first-come-first-serve system for UG admissions, colleges are supposed to offer admission to all applicants who meet the announced cut-off criteria. With around 220,000 students scoring 90% and above marks in CBSE Class 12 results this year and 70,000 of them scoring around 95% or more, the undergraduate cutoffs are likely to soar this year as well. Every year, DU receives around 80% of applications from students graduating from CBSE affiliated schools.Bijayalaxmi Nanda, principal of Miranda House college, said, “We have seen preliminary data from this year’s results and analysed the trends from last year as well. Colleges generally look at preferred subjects, cancellation between cut-offs, and other data points before deciding on the numbers. Cut-offs in most subjects including popular ones like some combinations of BA Programme, Political Science, Economics will increase by one to two percentage points and many courses will be in the range of 98-99%.”In DU, admissions to all undergraduate courses, except 15, are conducted on the basis of merit and scores in the previous qualifying examination. Admission to postgraduate, MPhil-PhD courses, and 15 undergraduate courses that include journalism, finance, and music, are held through DUET that is conducted by the National Testing Agency. This year, the exams will be conducted between September 26 and October 1.Though registrations will be closed on Tuesday, students appearing for their compartment exam or improvement exams will be allowed to upload their documents such as mark sheets and certificates after their results are declared later.In the absence of final board exams due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Class 12 CBSE results were prepared on the basis of Class 10, 11, and 12 internal scores of students in a ratio of 30:30:40. Students who were not satisfied with their results declared in July were given the option of appearing for physical exams later. The board is currently conducting examinations for such students along with those who need to appear for their compartment papers till September 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/with-one-more-day-still-to-go-ug-registrations-at-delhi-university-already-cross-435000-101630344825260.html

Given the surge in Covid cases, the Maharashtra government had postponed elections to cooperative bodies till August 31, 2021. As the deadline approached and Covid-induced restrictions eased, housing societies are eagerly awaiting government directions. In Pune district, there are 18,000 cooperative housing societies of which 4,000 are due for elections. “Housing societies with members less than 250 would be allowed to hold the elections. The official decision would be declared after the scheduled cabinet meeting this week,” said Balasaheb Patil.He also added that the final decision regarding the elections of other bigger cooperative societies is hanging because of the possibility of the third Covid wave. “The election process for bigger cooperative societies has begun, for example the work of preparing voter lists of four district cooperative banks whose financial condition is not good has started. As for the other societies, we are still contemplating what to do. Experts have warned about the third wave and so we have to be cautious,” said Patil. In the Pune district, of 18,000 cooperative housing societies, 17,000 have below 250 members. The Federation of Housing Societies demanded permission to hold elections for all cooperative housing societies. “We are demanding that all societies be allowed to hold elections. Preparations for all the other big elections have started. So housing societies should be given permission to hold the elections,” said Suhas Patwardhan, chairman of Pune District Cooperative Housing Societies Federation. Earlier, speaking in Pune on Friday, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had also hinted at allowing the elections to housing societies. After the postponement of elections in April, the District Cooperative Housing Societies Federation started to train members of housing societies to be returning officers for the elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/balasaheb-patil-coop-hsg-societies-with-less-than-250-members-will-be-allowed-to-hold-elections-101630344163621.html

The vigilant resident spotted the debris and rubble-laden tractor struggling up the kuchcha road along the hill slope and immediately notified the Aundh ward office. No sooner, the ward officials rushed to the site and managed to catch the tractor red-handed while dumping the rubble and debris on the road cutting through the hills.Sandip Khalate, assistant commissioner of the Aundh ward office, said, “We have confiscated the tractor, imposed a penalty of Rs25,000 on the driver, and are investigating further to find out the person behind it. Once we get the details, we will send our report to the roads’ department which will take necessary action.”Recently on August 24, locals and environmental activists complained about the sudden dumping of debris and rubble to build a kuchcha road cutting through the Baner-Pashan hills when PMC and Pune Smart City Development Corporation (PSCDCL) officials visited the area and denied tendering or authorising any work on the road. The officials assured the group that the debris and rubble would be removed, and that action would be taken against those responsible. Thereafter, the residents, along with the local corporators, lodged a police complaint against those responsible and sent letters to the PMC and PSCDCL to take further action.Vaishali Patkar, a concerned citizen and part of the team that lodged the police complaint, said, “This hill is part of the BDP (bio-diversity park) area and any kind of work here is illegal.

Instead of the previous 21-day limit, students now have 30 days to submit the certificate.At the time of confirming the admission in a college, a student has to submit an affidavit that the certificate copy will be submitted within 21 days. This can now be 30 days The first merit list of round 1 was declared on August 27 by the state education department.

We are running from pillar to post to get all the necessary documents and certificates. Now at least we get some time to get the NCL certificate within 30 days,” said Santosh Joshi, parent of a student.For this academic year, a total of 78,745 students registered for Class 11 admissions. Despite a high passing percentage for Class 10 this year, student registration was low. It is feared that a high number of seats will remain vacant this year.

Sumit Antil of Khewra village in Sonepat and Yogesh Kathuniya of Bahadurgarh in Jhajjar district brought laurels to the country after securing gold and silver medals in the javelin (F64) and discus (F56) throw events, respectively. Sumit’s mother Nirmla Devi said Sumit had lost his father Ram Kumar, an Indian Air Force personnel, when he was just 7. “He had promised me gold medal after Neeraj Chopra made history. I can’t forget that evening of January 5, 2015, when Sumit’s bike collided with a tractor-trolley and he lost one of his legs. He remained hospitalised for many months and a prosthetic leg was fitted in 2016. He never gave up on life,” she said. “He was trained by Virender Dhankar at Sai Centre in Sonepat initially and then he went to Delhi. His skills were sharpened by coach Naval Singh in Delhi. He was placed 5th in the Asian Championship in 2018. He bagged a silver in the World Championship the next year,” said the mother, narrating his sporting journey. Gian Chand, father of Yogesh Kathuniya, said they had installed a big screen to watch his son’s match. “He has fulfilled his promise of winning a medal,” he said. “After the match, we talked to Yogesh through a video call.

This will be implemented from March 31, 2025. The circular was issued recently by deputy secretary Kailas Badhan of the state urban development department. As per the circular, if an individual sets up a charging station for his/her own electric vehicle or any other electric vehicle in the society, then two per cent relief in property tax will be given. If a housing society sets up the charging facility for its members, then the property tax relief will be of 5 per cent for all society members. This decision has been taken to encourage use of electric vehicles in the state. Property owners will have to ensure the charging stations do not obstruct traffic in any way. If a housing society uses its charging facilities on a commercial basis, then the tax will not be charged at commercial rates, but at household rates. Atul Namekar, secretary of Sinhagad road-Warje residents association said, “There are many citizens in our area who have purchased electric cars in the recent times, but they find it difficult to charge. This decision will now encourage many housing societies to set up their own charging stations to help the public get some benefit it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/state-to-hsg-soc-set-up-charging-stations-for-e-vehicles-to-get-property-tax-discount-101630343324205.html

Police also found sensitive materials from the possession of Altamash, which he wanted to use to create tension in the state,” the minister said.Also Read: Spurt in communal incidents in Madhya Pradesh’s Malwa regionMishra, however, also said the authorities have not come across any link between the four accused and the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and Population Front of India (PFI) as previously suspected.Indore collector Manish Singh earlier indicated that there were intelligence inputs that these organizations were involved in the attempt to “create unrest.”“As of now, we found only a connection with AIMIM, not with PFI and SDPI. But more things will come out as police are still investigating the matter,” Mishra said.Local AIMIM representatives said the party held a membership drive in the state, and that anyone could have become a member.“We are holding a membership drive through a mobile application and anyone can become a member of the party. He might have taken membership but he was not connected with any leader,” said Tahir Anwar, a senior AIMIM leader in the state.Senior police officials said investigations into a series of incidents and protests led the police to the four accused, who during the investigation, allegedly revealed they were angered by the attack on bangle seller Taslim Ali.“After a series of incidents and protests, a special team of the cyber cell was formed to look at social media. During surveillance, police identified these four accused. They then told police that they were upset with the assault on bangle seller Taslim Ali and decided to create tension in a way that was difficult for the police to understand,” said Ashutosh Bagri, superintendent of police Indore (East).Police said more than 10 Whatsapp groups were allegedly created to circulate provocative and communal messages. “Many members of different organisations were found to be part of the groups. We also found a recording of more than 200 people on the mobile phone of Altamash,” said Bagri. In some recordings, he added, Altamash is heard making Altamash statements.Senior officials said the suspects were produced before the Indore district court on Monday via video conferencing.Indore deputy inspector general DIG Manish Kapuriya said, “The series of incidents relating to promoting enmity between two communities are happening due to social media. More people will be arrested as soon as a special team identifies them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/aimim-member-among-4-arrested-in-mp-for-inciting-communal-tension-says-minister-101630342844366.html

Mandi Board cotton state coordinator Rajnish Goel said, “Cotton purchase began on August 18. It was after nearly a decade that farmers started arriving in mandis with their produce in August.”Authorities attribute the early arrival to higher rates, which is a result of the growing demand. “Last season, the MSP for cotton varieties grown in Punjab was ₹5,725 per quintal. For this kharif season, the Centre has enhanced MSP on cotton by ₹200 onwards, depending on staple sizes. A notification of MSP on long-medium varieties sown in Punjab has not been issued yet, but this season’s MSP is expected to be ₹5,925,” he said, adding that the state was expected to produce 50 lakh quintal for the second consecutive season.“If private players continue paying higher prices, the season will also be ideal for arthiyas as Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) buys the produce directly from growers. Arthiyas get a fee of 2.5% per quintal. Private agents also lead to more employment for mandi labourers” he added.State agriculture director Sukhdev Sidhu said the early-sown or cotton crop sown in March gets ready for first picking in August whereas, in most of the area cotton, harvesting begins after September 15.“We have conducted two meetings with CCI authorities and they have assured us that they will procure, if rates crash below MSP; there are bleak chances of this happening. This season, no major pest attack has been reported. Bathinda and Mansa districts have reported few cases of deadly pink bollworm. Timely intervention contained the spread of the pest,” Sidhu added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cotton-being-procured-at-above-msp-trend-positive-for-stakeholders-101630342784832.html

According to the state health department, Maharashtra administered close to 11.9 million doses in August (till the 30th), while this number was 11.9 million in July as well. Tope said while supply from Centre to the state will increase in September the state will have a robust system in place to vaccinate even more beneficiaries.“The centre has promised to supply 17 million doses in September. Whatever centre gives, we distribute. We have proved we can vaccinate over 1 million in a day and can stretch beyond 1.5 million in a day,” Tope said in Jalna. In August, state administered 1.1 million doses on August 21, the highest so far. In Pune, a total of 7,454,366 doses have been administered as of August 29, with first doses being administered to 5,436,620 beneficiaries and second doses to 2,017,746 beneficiaries.

The ticket fare is ₹30 on the route, but now, for commuters, traveling by MSRTC buses, private vehicles or other transport options, has raised expenses.“Thousands of people come to Pune city from Baramati and Daund daily for their work in different fields like government and private offices, semi-government, banks, police department, blood banks, hospitals and several other emergency services. The number of passengers traveling between the cities is more than 10,000, so it is necessary that the train service be started immediately. Most of them cannot afford to travel by private buses or vehicles,” said Vikas Deshpande, secretary of the Daund-Pune-Daund Pravasi Sangh. “I daily travel by ST bus from Baramati to Pune for my job and many times I miss my scheduled bus and reach office late.

The standing committee of the PMC, with the BJP in a majority, has cleared all these proposals.NCP city unit president Prashant Jagtap said, “We have decided to oppose almost all proposals in the interest of the city. As BJP realises that they will not win power again, they are selling PMC properties with a vested interest. Besides the Swargate-Katraj metro route, we will oppose all proposals.”This latest statement comes on the back of much brouhaha about the NCP taking a stand on the leasing out of civic amenity spaces.All “mis-communication” was put to bed as NCP leader Ajit Pawar met party leaders and rank and file on Sunday to clear the air.NCP’s Rajya Sabha MP Vandana Chavan was of the opinion that since the BJP has the numbers to pass the proposal, her party should suggest some changes to the proposal. As those “suggestions” became demands, the proposal was left hanging fire before the GB last week, forcing the BJP to postpone the decision.After the Pawar tete-a-tete on Sunday, the NCP decided not to support the leasing out of amenity spaces by the PMC in Pune.Then on Monday, the party line seem to get even more strident as regards BJP proposals up for clearance at the PMC’s September GB.Speaking anonymously several NCP party leaders said, “Considering the municipal elections, we should become aggressive and oppose all such proposals. Already, for the leasing of amenity spaces, citizens have moved court opposing it. If BJP is getting the defamed, why should the NCP support them?”The NCP sources added, “The NCP has decided to become more aggressive in the coming days on all such new proposals. If NCP go with the BJP, it would send a wrong message to voters.”A Congress leader in the city, also speaking anonymously, said he expects the influx of several major, controversial proposals to come before the standing committee. “Already, the ruling party (BJP) has asked the administration to prepare these proposals,” the Congman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-ncp-to-adopt-a-hard-line-on-all-bjp-driven-civic-proposals-101630342303478.html

The people also got benefit of a governance system that worked without discrimination and was free of corruption, he said.The chief minister was speaking in a programme organized for the online transfer of the ₹1341.17 crore fund to the 2,00,853 beneficiaries of PM Awas Yojana (Urban) and PM Svanidhi Yojana at his official residence.The fund is being directly credited into the account of the beneficiaries with direct benefit transfer (DBT) system whereas earlier when money was given through cheques, there was corruption in the transfer of the money to the beneficiaries. Earlier, a Prime Minister had stated that central government sent ₹100 but the poor beneficiaries got merely ₹15. ₹85 was pocketed by corrupt officers, he said.To check corruption, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had created a DBT digital system under which the money was directly credited into the account of the beneficiaries of the various schemes launched by the BJP government, he said.Under Jan Dhan scheme, the account of the poor people was opened in the banks to ensure that poor people got benefits of government schemes. During the Covid 19 pandemic, crores of people got the benefits of the scheme.. They did not have to go to the banks to withdraw the money and were able to do so with the assistance of the banking correspondent sakhis appointed by the state government.The sensitive government committed for the welfare of the masses worked with devotion. Today without discrimination the people from various communities and class were getting benefits of the schemes, he said.During the past four and half years, the Uttar Pradesh government allotted houses to 40 lakh people in rural and urban areas. In urban areas alone, 17.16 lakh poor people got the benefits. As many as 8.65 lakh houses were constructed and the state government was working to provide houses to all the eligible poor people by 2022. The work done by the urban development and rural development departments for the welfare of the poor people had set an example before the country, he said.Before 2017, UP did not hold positions in the PM Awas Yojana scheme as the previous state government was not interested in ensuring that the poor people get benefit of the schemes. When the BJP government came to power in 2017, it worked to ensure that people got benefits of all the schemes. Today UP was top in the country in achievement of targets of all the schemes, he said.In PM Awas Yoja UP topped in the country. Nagar Palika Parishad Mirzapur had got first rank award in the country and Nagar Panchayat Haripur achieved third position in the ranking. UP would achieve top position in the 100 days challenge programme launched under the PM Awas Yojana in the country, he said.During Covid 19 pandemic, the central and state government launched PM Street Vendors Atma Nirbhar Nidhi. UP achieved first rank in this scheme as well. During lockdown, the street vendors suffered though the government supplied ration and distributed aother items. Out of the 7.55 lakh street vendors, 6.84 lakh were given loans. The state go0vernment was working for the rehabilitation and assistance of the street vendors, he said.The CM interacted with the beneficiaries of the both schemes through virtual medium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/a-good-govt-ensures-people-get-benefit-of-welfare-schemes-yogi-101630342244671.html

In the next four days the CET exam schedule will be declared.”“I came to Pune in the first week of August to prepare for the CET exams from my village in Buldhana district, but my entire month was wasted. Our family’s financial condition is weak due to the pandemic and staying here in Pune for more than a month is not possible.

The first wave ended in February, however, post that, numbers continued to rise and peaked in April. In June, the district reported 7,698 new Covid-19 cases and 135 deaths. This rose in July to 8,362 new Covid-19 cases and 2,283 deaths. The rise in cases could be because of the reconciliation process. However, the number of new Covid-19 cases has once again risen in August, with 7,794 new cases and 143 deaths reported. In August the city reported, on an average, 269 cases every day and 4.9 deaths on a daily basis, as of August 29.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, state Covid-19 advisor said, “There is definitely crowding in the streets of the city now that everything has opened up. The fear of the virus is reversely proportional to the number of new Covid-19 cases and so, when the number of cases fall, people are careless about following Covid-appropriate behaviour. We have multiple major festivals lined up from here onwards and so we have to be more careful. The reason for more cases could also be due to high testing carried out by the PMC, which is essential for early isolation and early treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pune-sees-more-covid-cases-and-deaths-in-aug-than-in-june-101630341943493.html

To note, Rajendra Singh was annoyed after the attack on BJP MLA Umesh Malik in Tikait’s village Sisauli. Gathwala Malik Khap is one of the major Khaps in the region which extends up to Haryana and has members in 52 villages of the region. Rajendra Singh, head of this Khap had expressed his dismay after attack on BJP MLA from Budhana constituency Umesh Malik in Tikait’s village Sisauli on August 14. Sisauli is also headquarters of the BKU where Malik had gone to attend a programme and faced the wrath of farmers. Umesh is a member of Gathwala Khap and believed to be close to Rajendra Singh. Attack on him annoyed Singh and he avoided attending panchayats being organised to support the proposed Mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar on September 5 under the aegis of BKU. Naresh Tikait is also choudhary of Baliyan Khap which has its members in 84 villages of the region. The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha ( SKM) has given call for Muzaffarnagar Mahapanchayat under BKU. It’s chief Naresh Tikait, his son Gaurav Tikait and other BKU leaders are reaching out to people through meetings, panchayats and seeking support of Khap chieftains and thambedars, including Gathwala Malik Khap. Though Rajendra Singh kept away from such meetings after attack on Umesh Malik, his counterpart of Baliyan Khap said, “We will persuade him in the interest of farmers,” and eventually both shared the dais in Kurawa village on Sunday and vowed to fight together for farmers. Former MP and member of Gathwala Khap, Harendra Malik also attended the panchayat and admitted that both had resolved differences on Sunday. Describing the forthcoming panchayat asa symbol of farmers’ struggle, Malik said that choudharies always came together in he larger interest of society and farmers and the same thing occurred on Sunday. Vikas Malik of Kurawa admitted that Khap head Rajendra Singh had faced tremendous pressure to attend the panchayat and extend his support to the Mahapanchayat, as 3 out of 4 thambedars (regional heads of the Khap) were already supporting the Mahapanchayat and majority of clan members too had shown their inclination towards it. Budhana block pramukkh Vinod Malik too believed that clan members’ growing support to the Mahapanhayat eventually compelled Rajendra Singh to think over his decision and he attended the panchayat with Tikait and both leaders vowed to intensify their fight for farmers. Malik accused the BJP of trying to divide people to weaken the ongoing farmers’ movement and said, “People now understand their dirty politics of dividing people so they ey won’t fall in the trap anymore”. Referring to controversial statements given by a few BJP leaders about farmers’ movement in the past, former MP Harendra Singh said that it was a calculated move of the BJP to provoke people and their any wrong move could give the party opportunity to malign the movement. “Their eventual strategy seems to project the ongoing movement as a Jat and non-Jat stir”, said Malik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tikait-resolves-differences-with-another-khap-chieftain-101630341104070.html

BSP national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra will address a series of Brahmin community meetings named ;prabudh vichar goshthi’ in Gorakhpur region from September 1. To ensure the success of the meetings, the BSP has launched door to door contact in the rural areas of Gorakhpur region. BSP MPs, MLAs and office -bearers are visiting the villages dominated by the Brahmin community to urge them to participate in the meeting in strength. A BSP leader said by organizing successful Brahmin conferences in Gorakhpur region, considered a stronghold of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, the BSP wished to send a message to the BJP that it maintained hold over his support base and was regaining lost ground as well. Along with the villagers, professionals, including lawyers, doctors, teachers, traders and people from various walks of life from the Brahmin community would participate in the meetings, he said. On September 1, the Brahmin conference will be organized in Shrawasti in Balrampur. On September 2, the conference will be organized in Deoria, Kushi Nagar, Gorakhpur and Maharajaganj districts. On September 3, the conference will be organized in Basti, Sant Kabir Nagar and Siddharth Nagar districts. In the 2017 assembly elections when the BJP wave swept the state, the BSP managed to secure victory on Chillupar assembly seat in Gorakhpur, with Vinay Shankar Tiwari defeating BJP candidate Rajesh Tripathi. Even as the BJP is working to maintain hold on the seats, the BSP plans to win the seats with the Dalit- Brahmin formula. A political observer AK Srivastava said Gorakhpur region had been witness to stiff rivalry between Brahmins and Rajputs for political dominance in the area. Former minister Hari Shankar Tiwari led the Brahmin community whereas the Rajput community was led by the successive mahants of Gorakhnath temple- Mahanth Avaidyanath and Yogi Adityanath. The BSP was working to propel the continuing rivalry to win the suppoort of the Brahmin community, he said. The BSP launched the Brahmin conference at Ayodhya on July 23. It played the Ram temple card, calling upon the voters to support the BSP in the 2022 assembly election for speedy construction of a grand temple. Addressing a Brahmin conference in Gonda on Monday, Mishra said the saffron brigade had raised a huge fund for the construction of Ram temple. But Ayodhya remained neglected and the construction of the temple was also continuing at a slow pace. The BJP must give details of the money contributed by the common people for the construction of the temple, he said. The atrocities over Dalits and Brahmins had increased under the BJP rule. Under the BSP government, the leaders of the Brahmin community were given important position in the government and party organization, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bsp-takes-fight-for-upper-caste-votes-to-yogi-s-home-turf-101630340563964.html

The decision came at the core committee meeting of the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) held in Guwahati ahead of the by-election to six assembly constituencies in the state. “The committee observed that ‘mahajot’ alliance partner AIUDF’s behaviour and attitude in relation to the Bharatiya Janata Party has baffled Congress party members. The AIUDF leadership’s and senior members’ continuous and mysterious praise of the BJP and the chief minister has affected public perception of Congress party,” a resolution adopted by the meeting read. “The core committee members of the APCC unanimously decided that the AIUDF can no longer remain an alliance partner of ‘mahajot’ and in this regard will send intimation to All India Congress Committee (AICC),” it added. Congress, AIUDF, Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF) and seven other parties were part of the ‘mahajot’ formed to counter the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. While Congress won 29 seats, AIUDF bagged 16, BPF won 4 and CPM bagged 1 seat—taking the grand alliance to 50 seats. On the other hand, BJP and its allies won 75 seats and returned to power for the second consecutive term. “The Congress is free to make decisions regarding their party, but we would term their decision to sever ties with us as a historical blunder. We had allied with Congress to oppose BJP’s communal agenda in the assembly polls,” said Md Aminul Islam, MLA and organising sectary of the AIUDF. “Congress can’t accuse us of having nexus with the BJP. Instead, today’s decision was the outcome of pro-BJP elements within Congress. It was a BJP strategy to use Sivasagar MLA and Raijor Dal president Akhil Gogoi to break our alliance. They become successful in that and Congress was the loser,” he added. In recent weeks, several Congress leaders have expressed that the party should sever ties with the AIUDF and instead try and include Raijor Dal in the alliance. Monday’s core committee meeting also decided that since the BPF had “already expressed their unwillingness in various forums to remain in the ‘mahajot”, it authorized APCC president Bhupen Borah to decide on the continuation of the party’s ties with BPF. By-elections to six seats are expected to take place in the coming weeks. Two seats were left vacant after the deaths of a BPF and a United Peoples Party Liberal (UPPL) member due to Covid-19 while two Congress leaders moved to the BJP. Former chief minister and Majuli MLA Sarbananda Sonowal joined the union cabinet and an AIUDF legislator is speculated to join BJP this week. Monday’s meeting reiterated the earlier decision to give full authority to the APCC president, along with working presidents and chairman of assembly seats constituted for the forthcoming by-elections to take decisions on election strategy, candidate selection etc. The meeting blamed the BJP-led government for failing on all fronts including resolution of border disputes with neighbouring states, management of Covid-19 and resolved to organize mass protests throughout the state in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aiudf-no-longer-part-of-grand-alliance-assam-congress-decides-ahead-of-bypolls-in-state-101630340386778.html

Those in past governments were afraid of being painted as ‘non secular’ if they visited Ayodhya, he said. Now it was a new India with the BJP in power when President and Prime Minister were visiting Ayodhya. The chief minister was in Mathura on Monday to offer prayers at Sri Krishna Janambhoomi on the occasion of Janmashtmi. Before reaching Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi, he went to the Ramlila ground to be part of the three-day ‘utsav’ organized by Uttar Pradesh Braj Teerth Vikas Parishad to celebrate the birth of Lord Krishna. Addressing the gathering at Ramlila ground, Yogi targeted opposition leaders and said that in past regimes, there were restrictions on celebrating festivals and time limits were set but it was not the same now. “No one came for celebrating our festivals and there was disruption in power and water supply but it is different now. In fact, birth celebrations of Lord Krishna take place at midnight and are now celebrated with fervor,” said the CM who had earlier in the day provided relaxation in night curfew on Monday for Janmashtmi. “During past regimes, leaders of political parties were wary of visiting Ayodhya, afraid of being painted as ‘non secular’ but now the scene has changed. The spiritual centres are rising and President Ram Nath Kovind became the first President to visit Ayodhya. Earlier Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the first PM to offer prayers to ‘Ramlala’ in Ayodhya,” he said. “The political leaders who hesitated in going to temples are now in the race, claiming that Ram and Krishna are their. Led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, this is new India,” said the CM in sarcasm. “We are fighting a battle against corona under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the situation is better in UP this Janmashtmi, making it possible for me to be part of the event organized by Braj Teerth Vikas Parishad. Yet we cannot lower our guard and would pray to the Lord in Mathura to end the demon of corona like other demons destroyed by Him,” he said. “Uttar Pradesh Braj Teerth Vikas Parishad was created to develop the Braj bhoomi (land) while preserving the heritage. No stone will be left unturned for development of Braj where seven destinations are given status of ‘teerth’ in Mathura,” asserted the chief minister. Accompanied by energy minister and MLA from Mathura Srikant Sharma, the CM reached the sanctum sanctorum of Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi and offered prayers to Lord Krishna. He received ‘prasad’ before leaving. Earlier, the CM reached Firozabad and met the families who lost their members to viral fever which is feared to have claimed 39 lives,, including 32 children, in the glass city. The CM also reviewed the arrangements being made at the district hospital in Firozabad where patients are undergoing treatment. The CM also interacted with the children admitted there. “About eight to nine localities in Firozabad are affected with this suspicious dengue like fever. Because of lack of awareness at local level, the patients were taken to private hospitals and clinics. After coming to know about it, the health department and administration got active and apprised authorities at state level,” Yogi said. “A separate ward has been created for this suspicious fever in Firozabad and the dedicated Covid ward has also been reserved as separate ward. In all, 32 children and 7 adults died of the suspicious fever,” informed the CM ‘The state government will send a surveillance team to Firozabad to work out if it is a fever like dengue or something else,” the CM told newsmen. The CM also visited Sudama Nagar, a locality where four people had died of viral fever and dengue. He interacted with the families. Anger prevailed among locals against the health department and Nagar Nigam. They alleged that garbage was left lying and drains were overflowing in inner areas of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cm-offers-prayers-in-mathura-targets-oppn-volte-face-101630340084575.html
30-08-2021||Patna||Bihar: JD(U) bid to project Nitish as ‘PM material’ a move to counter BJP||The ruling Janata Dal (United)’s fresh bid to project Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar as “PM material” through a resolution at its national council meeting in Patna on Sunday has once again fuelled speculation about its rift with ally Bharatiya Janata Party and its plans for the future. It’s not clear whether Kumar is really eyeing the top post in the country or it is just a move aimed at browbeating BJP, the senior partner in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar, where fault lines have surfaced of late. The resolution put up by JD(U) national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan Singh on Sunday had said that Kumar had all the qualities of becoming PM but was not in race for the top post. The resolution said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is holding the top post and is a candidate of the NDA for the premiership in the 2024 parliamentary polls too. JD(U)’s national general secretary K C Tyagi has said the resolution was aimed at dispelling confusion that Kumar was eyeing the top post. National parliamentary board Upendra Kushwaha, however, reiterated that Kumar is a “PM material” and the same has to be acknowledged.“The resolution has been brought to dispel confusion about the subject of Kumar being a PM candidate. But whatever one wants to take away from this is their choice,” Tyagi said on Sunday. On Monday, however, he reiterated that PM Modi will be the NDA’s candidate for the top post.Political insiders say BJP has started flexing muscles as a senior ally after the 2020 assembly polls, in which the party outperformed JD(U) for the first time in Bihar, and is no longer content with playing second fiddle in the coalition, which Kumar’s party has sensed all too well.In his latest move, Nitish Kumar recently led an 11-member all-party delegation from Bihar to meet the Prime Minister to press for a caste enumeration in Census 2021, which the union government had ruled out earlier. The delegation included Rashtriya Janata Dal’s Tajashwi Yadav, who is the leader of Opposition in Bihar and Kumar’s arch political rival.JD(U) has also sought to put BJP on the back foot with demand for a coordination committee in the NDA both at the Centre and in Bihar. “A coordination committee in the NDA both at a national and state level would help in sorting out matters within the alliance and also put a check on unwarranted statements issued by leaders,” Tyagi said.Observers are of the view that projecting Kumar as a PM candidate suits JD(U)’s interests of expanding the party’s footprint in other states and also leaves enough room for the 70-year-old veteran to explore new alliance options, mainly with the Congress or other regional parties, ahead of the 2024 parliamentary polls. “At a time when west Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee is trying to fill in as a probable PM candidate by rallying regional forces, it’s obvious the Bihar chief minister has some similar plans in days to come. The resolution at the national council meeting on Kumar having qualities of becoming PM is an indication, though in a subtle manner,” said a senior NDA leader, wishing not to be quoted. Meanwhile, the state BJP leadership was circumspect in its reaction over JD(U)’s national executive adopting a unanimous resolution on Kumar having the qualities to become PM. “This was a JD(U) meeting and passing a resolution is its internal matter. All parties express their aspirations about their leaders. It is nothing new. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is steering the NDA in Bihar and the government. We are all working under his leadership to make Bihar a developed state and BJP respects leaders of its allies. BJP does not interfere in other party’s affairs. Such things are done by parties like RJD and others,” said Nikhil Anand, state party spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-jd-u-bid-to-project-nitish-as-pm-material-a-move-to-counter-bjp-101630339663974.html
30-08-2021||Other||Janmashtmi revives Aligarh brass trade||Agra Devotees are thronging temples not only in the twin religious towns of Mathura-Vrindavan but all over the country to celebrate Janmashtmi and many of them are buying brass idols of Lord Krishna, particularly his child form ‘Laddoo Gopal. As these idols come from Aligarh, business in the lock city has started looking up. There are bulk orders from Mathura for brass idols, specially ‘Laddoo Gopal’. Lord Krishna was born in Mathura and Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi is the most popular temple in the town. In the pre- pandemic phase, lakhs of devotees reached Mathura to be part of Janmashtmi – the festival organized to mark the birth of Krishna. Guest- houses and hotels were packed to capacity and many devotees would sleep on road dividers for paucity of space. They used to stand in long queues to have a glimpse of the idols of Lord Krishna in temples all over the twin cities of Mathura and Vrindavan. But with the outbreak of Covid -19, everything changed and restrictions were imposed on devotees visiting temples while the portals of major temples like Bankey Behari, Dwarkadheesh and Sri Krishna Janmabhoomi remained closed for most part of the year. The festival of Janmashtmi was no exception and in 2020 it was a dull affair. This dampened the mood of the markets and orders for supply of brass idols were rare. But things have changed now because restrictions have been eased with corona under control. “Things are not as dull as last year, although restrictions continue at temples and inflow of devotees is not as smooth as it was in pre-pandemic days. But compared to last year, it is better. We have placed orders for brass idols this time and naturally ‘Laddoo Gopal’ is the first choice’ said Ajay Goyal, who has a shop in Chatta Bazar of Mathura. “Ninety percent of devotees coming during Janmashtmi seek brass idol of ‘Laddoo Gopal’ – a child form of crawling Krishna carrying ‘laddoo’ in one hand. These brass idols come from Aligarh and their demand continues till Diwali,” said Goyal. Krishan Kumar Varshney, a young entrepreneur who deals in brass handicraft items in Aligarh is delighted by the orders for brass idols pouring in and hopes that this hike in business will continue till Diwali, if another corona wave does not spoil things. “Surprisingly, we are getting orders in abundance which we are not able to meet. These orders are mainly coming from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka, besides Mathura with Janmashtmi and Ganesh Chaturthi ahead. Smaller units are busy getting orders for ‘Laddoo-Gopal’ while exporters too are busy with increased business,” said Varshney. “It is a pleasant surprise that orders are flowing in despite sharp rise in cost of brass which is presently available at Rs. 500 per kilogram when compared to ₹325 per kg about eight months ago. This increase in business is not only confined to brass idols but also enhancing prospects of lock, building hardware business of Aligarh,” stated Varshney. However, patron of Aligarh Statue Supplier Association Ashok Yadav did not sound as optimistic as Krishan Kumar Varshney about prospects of brass idol business. “There are more orders for brass idols when compared to last year but turnover is not the same compared to pre-pandemic times. We live in a nation where religious festivals are celebrated with fervour and brass idols are mostly of gods and goddesses. Trade picks up with Janmashtmi and continues till Diwali,” said Yadav. “Brass handicraft is still a cottage industry with no use of machines and brass idols are handmade, backbone of Aligarh’s economy. There are about 400 to 500 small units engaged in making brass idols which includes ‘sand casting’ and use of industrial oxygen in fine welding while making brass idols,” Yadav said. Yadav also highlighted the issue of GST linked with metal industry. “The GST on purchase of raw material of brass i.e. zinc and copper is 18 % but GST on finished brass metal product is 12 %. It should be uniform on raw material and end product,” he said .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/janmashtmi-revives-aligarh-brass-trade-101630339364700.html

Meanwhile, two deaths were reported owing to drowning in different parts of East Champaran.In East Champaran, major rivers like Gandak, Lalbakeya and Sikrahna continued to be in spate on Monday following heavy discharge of water from Valmikinagar barrage and incessant rain in the catchment area of Nepal. In the district’s Sangrampur block, while a large number of villagers have taken shelter on roads, Champaran embankment and other safer places, several families belonging to villages of Nautan block in West Champaran have taken shelter on Champaran embankment with their livestock. “We do not want to take any risk with regard to safety of our family members and livestock. Like many other villagers, we have put up our tent,” said one Prahalad Yadav, who has taken shelter on a road in Sangrampur block. When contacted, Sangrampur circle officer (CO), Suresh Paswan, confirmed the number of families taking shelter on embankment and other places between 50 and 60. “We are going to distribute raw food materials among them,” he said. Meanwhile, in Sagauli and Banjariya blocks of East Champaran, water entered low lying areas of about two dozen villages. “We are vigilant. However, need for evacuation has not arisen as yet,” Dharmendra Prasad Gupta, CO, Sagauli, said. Nautan CO (West Champaran) Bhaskar described few villages in the block as flood-prone. “There is a waterlogging in agricultural land and the possibility of flood in few villages cannot be ruled out if water level rises further. We have already alerted residents of those villages,” he said. Besides, in West Champaran, road link between Lauriya and Narkatiaganj was disrupted, as water from Sikarahana river inundated a road at a diversion near Ashokan Pillar in Lauriya. Link between Sheohar and Motihari through Patahi is expected to be disrupted for next few days, said Kumar Ravindra, SDM Pakaridayal. In Gopalganj district, several families in Baikunthpur, Gopalganj (Sadar), Barauli, Kuchaikote, Majha and Sidhawaliya blocks have also taken shelter on roads and safer places following incessant rainfall and rise in water level in Gandak river. “Around 200 people shifted to safer places each in Baikunthpur and Sidhawaliya. Community kitchens are on at five places in the district,” said Birendra Prasad, additional district magistrate (ADM), in-charge of disaster management, Gopalganj. Gandak’s water level has risen by around three inches above the danger level, he said. The district administration, however, has ruled out any threat on embankment. “Though water level has risen in Gandak, it is static now. We are watchful,” said Dr. Naval Kishor Choudhary, Gopalganj’s district magistrate (DM).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/villagers-take-shelter-on-roads-amid-flood-fear-in-north-bihar-2-drown-101630339244250.html

The fourth member, identified as Krushna Jadhav of Walhekarwadi, Chinchwad, is on the run, said Krishna Prakash, commissioner of Pimpri-Chinchwad police at a press meet on Monday. The arrested are Lakhan Ashok Jetithor (32) of Walhekarwadi and native of Solapur, Ravi Shivaji Bhosale (42) of Nakhati vasti in Rahatani and a mechanic by profession, and Suresh Narayan Jadhav (42) of Kalewadi in Rahatani, and a native of Satara. Jetithor had sold the stolen valuables to Bhosale and Jadhav, according to the police. Jetithor has nine cases registered against him in Solapur between 2009 and 2012. He was found to have been running a Chinese cuisine restaurant near gurudwara in Chinchwad. The Pimpri-Chinchwad police forwarded his details to Solapur counterpart to confirm his identity. “The main accused would recce places with dense population twice a day – in the morning and evening – to ensure that the house was locked. He would return around 2 am, break into the house and steal valuables,“ read a statement from the police. To mislead the police, the man had rented three houses in the same area. Before leaving the house, he would put his phone on flight mode to avoid tracking. After the theft, he would take the loot to his friend and co-accused, Krushna, who lived nearby to avoid CCTV camera trail. The police have recovered over 780 grammes of stolen gold, 10 television sets, one Toyota Fortuner registered in Chinchwad from the four men. The total worth of the recovered goods was found to be 77,47,200, according to the police. “Due to the Covid lockdown, the two accused had kept the valuables with them. Jetithor was planning to buy a house with the money he earned after selling the goods to the other accused. Suresh used to sell the gold at a jewellery shop owned by one of his female relatives,” read a statement by senior inspector Vishwajeet Grey of Chinchwad police station. Of the 30 cases registered against the group since 2020, 26 were registered in Chinchwad, three in Bhosari and one in Checkley police station.

30-08-2021||Patna||Bihar faces fresh flood threat||Flood threat loomed over north and central Bihar as water level in almost all rivers, including Ganga, has started soaring again after a brief respite till last week, officials of state’s water resources department said on Monday. Incessant rains in the foothills of Himalaya in Nepal and in the upper catchment areas of river Ganga are causing the rise in water level of almost all rivers criss-crossing the northern districts of the state. Ganga, which has been maintaining a receding trend for the past few weeks, almost touched the danger level (DL) at Patna’s Gandhi Ghat Monday evening, while floodwaters from rivers like Gandak, Parmar, Burhi Gandak, Bagmati, Kosi, Adhwara, Ghaghra and Punpun have jumped the DL at different points and begun showing their ferocity, inundating a vast stretch of land around their course. The flash-flood in Masaan river, a tributary of Gandak, submerged over a dozen villages in Ram Nagar of Bagaha Sunday night, leaving no time for the residents to plan their evacuation. By the morning, these villages turned an island, as all road leading to them were under a sheet of four-five feet of water. Diara (riverine) areas of Gandak in West Chanparan district were submerged following heavy discharge in the river from Vamikinagar Barrage. Officials said nearly 4 lakh cusecs of water was released Monday morning. WRD officials said Ganga was reported flowing just three centimetres below the DL at Gandhi Ghat in Patna and was maintaining the rising trend, while it has jumped the red line at Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur by nearly 40 cm. At Hathidah, where the river set a new highest flood level (HFL) this year, Ganga was flowing 42 above the DL. Punpun was also in surge mode and crossed the DL at Sripalpur by 40 cm. Parmar river began wreaking havoc in Forbesganj and Araria districts, engulfing more than three dozen villages on Monday. The river was flowing nearly 27 cm above the DL at Araria. Over a dozen villages of Khairkha panchayat were cut off from the district headquarter in Forbesganj, forcing the people to take shelter on the uplands. Miseries of marooned people in Gopalganj and Chapra districts worsened after swollen Gandak and its tributary, Dabra river, rose above the DL along their course. Gandak was flowing nearly 1m above the DL at Dumariaghat in Gopalganj, while hundreds of houses in town areas of Chapra were flooded when safety embankment of Dabra river was partially broken down.

30-08-2021||Chandigarh||Curbing graft, jobs on merit my biggest achievement: Khattar||Haryana chief minister ML Khattar on Monday said that tightening the noose around corrupt practices and providing jobs on merit were the two biggest achievements of his government. The chief minister, who was addressing a press conference on completing 2,500 days of two terms in power, said his government has always remained vocal about fixing accountability in the administrative process, not allowing interference of middlemen and ensuring people do not have to run from pillar to post to get their work done. “We have brought radical reforms to replace “right to corruption” with the right to service,’’ he said. The chief minister said several digital reforms were initiated in each sector be it issuing change of land use, transferring teachers online, giving government jobs on merit, curbing frauds in distribution of public distribution system, pensions, stipends and subsidies being given to the poor. He said that in a bid to eradicate irregularities in the transport department, the state government has launched ‘Operation Shudhi’. He said that good governance for him meant transparency and accountability in administration. The chief minister said various initiatives and schemes have been launched for farmers’ welfare and an amount of ₹11,000 crore has been transferred directly to the accounts of about 50 lakh farmers under various schemes. He said various schemes like Mukhyamantri Bagwani Bima Yojana (MBBY), Bhavantar Bharpai Yojana are being run for the welfare of farmers. Khattar said more than 82,000 youth have been given government jobs on the basis of merit. He said that ‘One Registration’ facility has been started so that the youth do not have to repeatedly apply for Group C and D government jobs. Besides this, a provision of the ‘Common Eligibility Test’ has been made to save the time of the aspirants applying and appearing for various government jobs, he added. Khattar said the present government didn’t only made announcements for the sake of making political noise. “We have instead revolutionised the system,” he claimed. “With the objective of facilitating disbursal of benefits to eligible citizens, the Parivar Pehchan Patra scheme has been launched under which, till date, about 63 lakh families have been registered,” said the CM.

Many had also pointed to contradictions with the proposed national scrappage policy. “The general public is informed that the validity of all category of vehicles in the RC is shown as 15 years. But, a diesel vehicle cannot ply in Delhi beyond 10 years in terms of court orders. However, NOC can be obtained for diesel vehicle beyond 10 years but less than 15 years for states which have conveyed their concurrence for registration of such diesel vehicles,” read the notice. “Owners of such vehicles, i.e., more than 10 year old diesel and more than 15 years old petrol vehicles, are hereby advised not to ply these vehicles on the roads in Delhi-NCR, and further advised to get such end-of-life vehicles scrapped through authorised scrappers of the transport department, the list of which is available at the website of the department,” it further stated. At present, the Delhi transport department is reaching out to owners of vehicles registered in 2014-15 and have de-registered at least 100,000 such vehicles so far. Officials said that this number is quite small as there are 3.8 million vehicles -- 3.5 million petrol and 300,000 diesel -- which are older than the permitted age limits. As per orders issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2015 and the Supreme Court in 2018, any registered diesel vehicle over 10 years old and petrol vehicle over 15 years old cannot operate in the National Capital Region (NCR). This is different from the Centre’s draft scrappage policy, where the age for re-registration depends on whether it is a private or a commercial vehicle, and will also take into account the fitness of the vehicle.Officials, however, said the Centre’s draft vehicle scrapping policy will have little impact for owners of vehicles registered in Delhi, unless there are fresh directions from the NGT or the Supreme Court. In March, the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) released the first draft of the national voluntary vehicle scrappage scheme, under which a private vehicle over 20 years old will have to mandatorily undergo fitness and emission tests, failing which it will be deemed as an end-of-life vehicle (EOLV) and scrapped.For commercial vehicles, the age limit is 15 years, following which such vehicles will have to pay more for fitness certificates and also cough up a “green tax” which will vary from state to state, depending on the pollution levels.None of the rates have been decided yet and the policy is likely to be implemented from next year.“Delhi’s motor licensing officers issue no-objection certificates (NOCs) for vehicles that are either above 15 years old, or above 10 years if it is a diesel variant. The vehicles cannot be used in Delhi, but these NOCs can be used in select states to get the vehicle re-registered there. It is illegal to drive any such vehicle without re-registration in that state,” said a senior transport official.States where such vehicles are allowed to be sold and re-registered include Rajasthan, which allows it in all its districts; Bihar (18 districts); Maharashtra (26 districts); Uttar Pradesh (33); West Bengal (all districts but only BS-IV vehicles); and Meghalaya (all districts).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/transport-dept-clarifies-rc-valid-for-15-years-but-diesel-vehicles-over-10-years-old-petrol-variants-older-than-15-years-cannot-ply-on-delhi-roads-101630337264147.html

The duo, Prahlad Rajput, 57, and Ram Bahadur, had crossed over to Pakistan inadvertently, officials said.Prahlad, of Ghoshi Patti village in Sagar district of Madhya Pradesh (MP), had reported to be missing from his home around 30 years ago. In January 2014, the MP government had found that Prahlad had been lodged in a jail in Pakistan. The Indian authorities had initiated the process to bring Prahlad back that year itself.Ram Bahadur, of Uttar Pradesh (UP), is deaf and dumb. It is not clear when and how he had crossed over to Pakistan. Punjab Police’s protocol officer Arun Pal said, “Ram Bahadur has been handed over to the Amritsar Red Cross Society. The society will check his address to help him find his family.”The duo’s repatriation comes a day after India repatriated two Pakistani nationals, Abbas Ali Khan, 42, and Bhag Chand, 17. They had completed their sentences in jails. Of the two, one was a juvenile, who had inadvertently crossed the Indian border from Rajasthan two years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pak-repatriates-two-indians-after-years-in-jail-101630332464002.html
30-08-2021||Chandigarh||Is the world still a big place? Time to adjust our perspective||Our family get-together in the US couldn’t have come at a more perplexing time. On the one hand we were nearly smothered with warnings and admonitions about the dangers of going out and on the other hand the alluring words of persuasion urging us to board the flight. The nightmarish days of anxiety about Covid tests, results, immigration rules and arduous hours on the plane with double masks on were quite a walk on thorny path. On reaching home, the warm hugs, squeals of animated laughter from the grandchildren felt as refreshing as would water on desert-parched lips. Then dawned the realisation that though we were braving pandemic fears and the lockdown rules stoically, somewhere in the subconscious we were gasping for normalcy. We are a group of keen bridge players. During the pandemic, we discovered the wonders of technology as we switched over to online playing. We would log in at the same time and form a table of friends we wanted to play with. On reaching America while the body was still on India clock, I sent a message to three friends, one in London (also on a sojourn like us), another in Delhi and one in Jalandhar. We connected immediately and formed our foursome. What a euphoric experience! I don’t remember much of how we fared at the game but all of us felt a heightened sense of exhilaration. The unexpected connection traversing oceans and time zones left us on a high, unmeasured and unexplained. The initial couple of days in the beautiful, clean and green surroundings had a fairy tale feel. The largeness of everything takes the breath away. Nature can be experienced in all its magnitude. The ever-evolving shapes of the clouds in multiple layers across the infinite sky, the ineffable hues as the sun descends in all its majesty behind the trees that adorn the circumference of wherever one looks cannot be quantified. It reminds one of novelist Alice Walker’s quote: “In nature, nothing is perfect, and everything is perfect. Trees can be contorted, bent in weird ways, and they’re still beautiful.” In the backyard, on a big bough of a big tree hangs a beautiful bird feeder. It is a mesmerising sight as the birds swoop down to partake of the grains, jet black, a few scarlet, blue, grey and black, black and yellow, tiny green birds, all throng together with the squirrels and the chipmunks. The butterflies during the day and the glow worms at night leave one in silence, savouring every aspect of Creation. The microcosm and the macrocosm! Where do we fit? I still wake up with the alarm very often in the morning to play with my friends in India. In an age of globalisation characterised by dizzying technologies, at that moment I feel the connection and exchange of energy of both places. Is the world a big place anymore? Do time and distance keep anyone apart? I think it is time to adjust our perspective. A thing is mighty big only when time and distance cannot shrink it. promildada@yahoo.com The writer is a freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/is-the-world-still-a-big-place-time-to-adjust-our-perspective-101630331743795.html

30-08-2021||Dehradun||AAP says Char Dham Board will be scrapped if party assumes power in Uttarakhand||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced that it will scrap Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board if it comes to power in Uttarakhand in the 2022 assembly polls. Colonel (retd) Ajay Kothiyal, chief ministerial candidate of AAP in the state, said if their party comes to power, it will scrap the Char Dham board in line with the aspirations of the agitating priests. “For centuries, priests of each of these shrines have developed unique relationships with the pilgrims. Against this backdrop, the government cannot just bring a board that uses the same barometer for all Char Dham shrines. You have to respect their unique traditions and the way they have been managing these shrines for centuries,” he said. This is another major announcement by the party after it said it will provide free electricity in the hill state and will make Uttarakhand the spiritual capital for Hindus across the world. The priest community is not happy with the formation of the board and the BJP government taking over the management of these shrines which they had been managing for centuries. The agitating priests have even warned that if the decision on scrapping the Board is not taken by September 1, a large number of people from the priest and Brahmin community will go for a mass resignation from the BJP. On August 17, one of the two main announcements party chief and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal made in Dehradun was that AAP will make Uttarakhand the spiritual capital for the Hindus across the world. In April this year, the then chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat had announced that the state government will review the formation of the Char Dham Devasthanam Board. But when Pushkar Singh Dhami took over the reins of the state, he announced the formation of a high-powered committee that will talk with all stakeholders, following which a decision will be taken on the status of the Char Dham Board. The agitating priests are not happy with this. Santosh Trivedi, a priest from Kedarnath shrine and vice president of Akhil Bharatiya Teerath Purohit Yuva Mahasabha, who also wrote a letter with his blood earlier this month to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanding to scrap the Char Dham Devasthanam Board, questioned why should government manage the shrines when traditionally the priests have been doing so efficiently for centuries. “The government keeps talking that it will not interfere with our rights. But they never talk about which rights. We want to extend our gratitude to AAP for coming out in support and announcing that it will scrap the board if it comes to power,” he said. Madan Kaushik, state BJP president said that the BJP government has already stayed the functioning of the board and formed an empowered committee that will hold talks with the priests and other stakeholders and resolve the issue. Devendra Bhasin, state BJP vice president said everybody knows that AAP will not come into power in the state. “They are making these announcements to mislead the people here. The BJP government is serious about this issue and that is why a high empowered committee has been formed which is talking to all stakeholders to come out with a solution,” he said.Political analyst Professor SS Semwal, who teaches political science at Garhwal University, said, AAP toeing the Hindutva line won’t make much difference in the elections as people here want jobs and upliftment of the local economy. “Voters won’t decide on whether AAP has supported priests or not. They are worried about unemployment, migration, poor healthcare and so on. Such announcements are more about optics right now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/aap-says-char-dham-board-will-be-scrapped-if-party-assumes-power-in-uttarakhand-101630327844867.html

The 13,000-litre plant that can refill 800 jumbo cylinders in a day was inaugurated on Saturday at a primary health centre in Chhapi town in Banaskantha district dominated by Dalits, minorities and adivasis.“It was to reiterate my team’s commitment to work for all irrespective of the religion or caste that Father Nelson, Mukteshwar Giri Maharaj, Maulana Abdul Khuddus and a Buddhist Satish Rashtrapal inaugurated the plant,” he said. The plant is the biggest in Gujarat to have been set up by any MLA or MP, and it took Mevani’s relentless effort to see the project through. The struggle began in May when the Gujarat charity commissioner froze the account of an NGO, We The People Charitable Trust, following a complaint that it was wrongfully collecting donations through crowdfunding on behalf of Mevani.By then, ₹36 lakh had been collected but since the account was frozen, Mevani moved the Gujarat high court seeking a direction to the state government to allow him to use his MLA fund to create health facilities in his constituency. The Congress, which had vacated the seat for him in the 2017 assembly election, joined him with a similar petition in the high court. While the hearings were on, the state government announced that all legislators could use their discretionary funds to create Covid-related health facilities in their respective constituencies. After the inauguration of the plant, Mevani said, “We have been able to cut through the red tape of a hostile government to initiate an accessible healthcare infrastructure for the people of Vadgam.”About the NGO’s funds, he said, “We took the help of an NGO but the authorities froze its account and it still remains inaccessible. We had no other alternative but to approach the high court to allow us to use funds from my MLA grant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mlajignesh-mevani-starts-oxygen-plant-in-his-constituency-in-gujarat-101630323763571.html

At present, there is no other legislation listed for the session. Direct PSERC to revise tariff, govt urged Sidhu posted a video on social media, seeking the extension of one-day Vidhan Sabha session to five to seven days to pass a legislation to terminate the PPAs. He said that the one-day session is not enough to take up issues concerning the public. The PPA scrapping issue is a part of the 18-point agenda of the party high command, he said, adding that he has raised it before the chief minister. “The Punjab government must immediately issue directions to the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) in public interest to revise tariff being paid to private power plants, making the faulty PPAs null and void. Further calling a 5-7 day Vidhan Sabha session to bring a new legislation for termination of faulty PPAs,” said Sidhu, while posting the video. On lines of terminating river-sharing pact He said that just as the assembly had passed the Punjab Termination of Agreements Act in 2004 on river water sharing with Haryana, the Vidhan Sabha should pass the legislation to bring down the power tariff. “We are already paying ₹10,000 crore subsidy but still have scope for reducing power prices by amending faulty PPAs. This will help the government give free units to general category consumers and also bring down the power tariff to ₹5 per unit,” he said. “This will help the Punjab government give 300 units of free power to all domestic consumers, including the general category, decrease domestic tariff to ₹3 per unit and ₹5 per unit for industry, along with the redressal of all outstanding bills, and waiving of unjustifiable and exorbitant bills,” he said. After Sidhu raised the power tariff issue and need to terminate PPAs, the chief minister asked the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) and the power department to initiate the process to scrap the faulty PPAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-power-tariff-extend-special-assembly-session-to-scrap-ppas-says-sidhu-101630323283561.html
30-08-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: Politics of the ‘yatra’ embedded in DNA of all parties||During July 2019, Maharashtra was witnessing a moderate monsoon, with rain taking intermittent breaks, when the state’s political atmosphere began to heat up, as the state was heading for assembly elections in the next four months. That was when Aaditya Thackeray, then just a Yuva Sena leader, decided to undertake a statewide yatra to thank the people who voted for the Shiv Sena in the recently held Lok Sabha elections, and to seek their blessings for the upcoming Assembly elections. Not to mention, that was also called a Jan Ashirwad yatra. Even as the Shiv Sena did not get the seats it targeted, the yatra brought political stature to Aaditya, who later became a cabinet minister in Maharashtra. While the latest Jan Ashirwad yatra undertaken by BJP leader and Union minister Narayan Rane had nothing in common with that of Thackeray’s, both, like many others, had strong political motives. If there’s a common thread through the political parties of India, of yatras or long journeys clubbed with rallies, speeches and a political motive. In Maharashtra, yatras have done magic, particularly for the BJP when it was not in the game in state politics. In the mid-1990s, late BJP leader Gopinath Munde had undertaken a major journey, what was then called a Sangharsh yatra (journey of struggle). If Munde, along with party colleague, the late Pramod Mahajan, was responsible for the BJP’s meteoric rise in Maharashtra, his Sangharsh Yatra is believed to have contributed significantly to the victory of the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance in the 1995 state assembly elections. Through whirlwind statewide tours, Munde addressed more than 150 meetings, exposing various scams of the Congress-led government, which went on defensive. Later in 2014, Munde’s daughter Pankaja Palve-Munde led another 14-day tour – this time called the “Punha Ekda Sangharsh Yatra (Once again, Journey of struggle) - on the lines of a similar expedition to her father’s, to evoke his memories. Her tour came days after the sudden demise of her father that shook state BJP unit. It’s not just BJP leaders who have undertaken such yatras. Parties of all hues have hit the streets with roadshows to rev up their message on topics dominating the news cycle or divert attention from issues that are problematic. Does such a yatra really help any leader to turn the tide in his favour? The answer can be mixed, even as it helps politicians to stir up the atmosphere, galvanise the cadre and create a buzz. After all, it allows politicians to come to peoples’ doorsteps instead of the other way round. This is probably the reason that the response yatras receive is often amazing and helps in political mobilisation. At the same time, the grandeur of a yatra with a focused theme also helps connect better with the target audience. Just before 2019 assembly polls, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) led by Sharad Pawar embarked on similar expedition. Called the ‘’Shivswarajya Yatra’’, the aim was to launch a mass outreach programme, starting from Shivneri Fort in Pune’s Junnar taluka, the birth place of Chhatrapati Shivaji. The mother of all yatras that gave a new lifeline to the BJP in the early 1990s was the one taken out by party patriarch LK Advani. The Rath Yatra on the Ram Mandir issue helped the BJP achieve power at the Centre later. That yatra was also identified by Advani’s rivals for arousing communal passions that led to the demolition of the Babri Masjid. Yatras existed even before that. Originally, Mahatma Gandhi popularised the concept during the freedom struggle, though later it was used as a political instrument by leaders. Accordingly, for Rane, the goal is clear - to regain his lost grip over the Konkan and also to help his party the BJP, wrest power in the upcoming Brihan Mumbai elections. However, controversy generated over Rane’s “slapping the chief minister” comments may have helped Uddhav Thackeray more, as it galvanised the Shiv Sainiks, who perform better on the streets than through any government.

30-08-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab govt driving farmers’ agitation, says Haryana CM||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday accused the Congress government in Punjab of driving the farmers’ agitation against the BJP-led Centre’s three farm laws. “Isme Punjab government ka haath hai. I’m levelling a serious allegation here. Otherwise (farmer leader) Balbir Singh Rajewal would not have been offering sweets to the Punjab chief minister (Capt Amarinder Singh),” he said at a press conference in Chandigarh. Also read: Karnal lathi-charge: Haryana govt has no right to remain in power, says SenaKhattar said that 85% of those sitting at the Singhu and Tikri borders adjoining the national capital were from Punjab. On Capt Amarinder asking Khattar to apologise to farmers, he said: “Who is he to ask me to apologise or resign. Rather, he should resign for instigating farmers. You can count people sitting on Delhi’s borders. They are mostly from Punjab, not from Haryana. Farmers of Haryana are satisfied.” Disruptions won’t help: CM to farmers He said that the protesting farmers should adhere to norms of democracy. “This agitation is not gaining anything due to such acts of disruption. The public sentiment is turning against them. Right to expression is a fundamental right but no one has the right to disrupt. They did not allow me to land at a meeting venue on a previous occasion. I decided to avoid landing since it would have created a big problem,” the chief minister said. “I’m experienced enough to handle the farmers’ agitation. If farmers sit down and are willing to talk, a way can be found. But they actually don’t want a solution, they only want to play politics,” he said.Referring to the action of Karnal sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Ayush Sinha, who was heard instructing police personnel to hit farmers on the head if they broke barricades to disrupt a BJP meeting on Saturday, Khattar admitted that his choice of words was not right. “He (Sinha) should not have used such language though it is the job of officials to enforce law and order. I’m not saying he should not have enforced the rule of law strictly,” he said. Mahapanchayat in Gharaunda Farmers from across Haryana gathered for a mahapanchayat convened by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha at the grain market in Gharaunda town on Monday afternoon against the police lathicharge on farm protesters in Karnal on Saturday. Senior representatives of the SKM are deliberating on intensifying the agitation against the BJP-JJP government in Haryana. They have been demanding action against the police and the Karnal SDM. Bharatiya Kisan Union state president Gurnam Singh Charuni had urged all farmer unions to attend the mahapanchayat for a unanimous decision. He alleged that the farmers were beaten up 15km from the BJP meeting. Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala has also assured farmers that action will be taken against the SDM but Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav has given him a clean chit, saying that the officer was trying to prevent farmers from removing barricades and his intention was right.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-govt-driving-farmers-agitation-says-haryana-cm-101630313203690.html

30-08-2021||Lucknow||Historian, queer rights activist Saleem Kidwai dies in Lucknow||Noted historian and queer rights activist based in Lucknow Saleem Kidwai passed away Monday morning after suffering a heart attack. He had recently turned 70.Kidwai, born in 1951, is the author of Same-Sex Love in India: Readings from Literature and History (2001) which he co-authored with Ruth Vanita, a professor at the University of Montana.A copy of this book was given to the judges of the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court while it heard a clutch of petitions against Section 377, a colonial-era law that criminalised adult consensual same-sex relationships.The law was read down in 2018 after a historic legal battle, which spanned over two decades in the Delhi high court, and later with different benches of the apex court.Mario da Penha, a queer history scholar who co-founded the Jawaharlal Nehru University’s first queer students’ collective, Anjuman in 2003, said that the book came at a time when there was little representation of queer lives in literature. “Same Sex Love in India spoke to the queer experience in India at a time when there were only a handful of books on the theme. It was the first attempt at tracing the long history of same-sex love in the subcontinent. It encompassed the academic, the activist and the literary world, and it did so with a seriousness and flair that was rare to find at the time. It was a testament to the years of research that both authors, Ruth Vanita and Saleem Kidwai, had put in,” he said.Kidwai taught Indian medieval history at the University of Delhi’s Ramjas College and was associated with the gay rights movement helping establish support spaces for the Lesbian, Bisexual, Gay and Transgender (LGBT) community in the national capital.In 1999, Chapal Mehra, a public health consultant and writer, created a queer space with Kidwai and a few others in New Delhi. Called Humraahi, it operated out of the office of the non-governmental organization Naz Foundation India Trust, which went on to file a petition against Section 377 in the Delhi high court a few years later. The group, said Mehra, benefitted greatly from Kidwai’s experience and soon started hosting films, discussions and even a helpline.“There were talks, sharing circles, movie screenings, all of which are trendy today but weren’t used in that much capacity at the time. We held discussions on a range of issues, from safer sex practices to forced marriages and arrests by the police. A lot of the affirmative narratives we see in the media today trace their genesis to the work that groups like ours were doing at the time. Of course, at the time, we never thought we were doing anything extraordinary. We were just helping ourselves and others like us. But Saleem’s role was pivotal. He suggested what events we could do, and how we could manage things,” Mehra said.Kidwai remained involved in queer activism even after the apex court overturned Section 377. He attended Pride events and marches in Lucknow, including one held earlier this year in March. He was a panellist and a mentor at the Awadh Queer Literature Festival which took place in Lucknow in 2019.While his scholarship had a deep impact on the lives of queer people, Kidwai’s contribution to Urdu literature was equally immense, as he translated into English works of key Urdu writers and added to the scholarship on the lives of “singing ladies” and courtesans in Mughal India. Among his most significant translations are Malka Pukhraj’s autobiography, Song Sung True; most recently, he translated Qurratulain Hyder’s 1952 book, Safina-e-gham-e-dil, into English titled Ship of Sorrows.“Saleem Kidwai’s work on LGBTQ lives is well known. His work emphasised the inclusive and plural customs of Indian history. He wrote on the courtesans of India and their musical and literary heritage. No work on Begum Akhtar is complete without his contribution. He is the only author to translate Qurratulain Hyder’s books apart from Hyder herself. As a historian, translator, activist and just the most wonderful person he will be missed. He was a gentleman of the old school, and they don’t make them anymore,” said Urdu scholar and author Rana Safvi. Vanita, who teaches at the University of Montana, said that her dedication to Kidwai in a book, Gandhi’s Tiger and Sita’s Smile (2005) best encapsulated how she remembered him: “They have seemed to be together, though absent; shook hands, as over a void; and embraced, as it were from the ends of opposed winds.”Kidwai was buried in his native village of Badagaon in Barabanki late Monday evening. He is survived by sisters Sufia, Uzra, and Hafsha, and nephews, Jamaal and Saif.

30-08-2021||Bhopal||Spurt in communal incidents in Madhya Pradesh’s Malwa region||For many years, the neighbouring villages of Chandan Khedi and Kanwasa in Madhya Pradesh’s Malwa region were known for their communal harmony. Things changed, however, last year. In Malwa, the region which includes MP cities such as Indore, and Ujjain, at least 12 incidents of communal tension have been reported since September 2020 where section 153 A (promoting enmity between different different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth etc) of the Indian Penal Code was invoked. At least 70 people have been charged, at least 70 booked, and the National Security Act has been invoked against 18 people, said the police.The December 29 chain of events only deepened the communal scars. That day, a fund-raising rally for the Ayodhya temple was allegedly attacked, and some Muslims homes torched in Kanwasa. Chandan Khedi sarpanch Ashok Parasiya said he had never seen communal tension before the December violence. “Wounds may have healed and houses are being reconstructed but what about the trauma?” he asked. Saddam Patel, 35, a resident of Chandan Khedi village, whose house was burnt down in the December violence, and suffered a gunshot wound in the leg, said, “On December 29, people held a rally to collect fund for the construction of Ram temple and shouted slogans against our religion. We objected so they burnt our houses and vehicles. Neither police nor the administration supported us. Instead, they jailed people from our community in a fake case. They also invoked NSA against four of us.”Also Read | Dindori: As district gets added to India’s Maoist map, what it means for StateFour cases have been reported this August itself in the region, with two hitting the headlines -- the assault on bangle seller Taslim Ali in Indore, where he was eventually charged with sexual harassment, and the alleged raising of anti-national slogans at a Muharram procession in Ujjain, which has seen arrests even as questions were raised on the authenticity of video proof. Both Hindu and Muslim organisations have hit the streets in protest over the past week over both the incidents. At least 2,600 people have been booked for attending events held without permission amid the Covid protocols.Muslim organisations allege that it is the BJP’s “hard Hindutva” at play, with mostly Muslims being charged with NSA. Hindu organisations, however, claim the Popular Front of India (PFI) and Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) are stoking tensions.Hindu Jagran Manch, Malwa in-charge Dheeraj Yadav said, “The minority communities are being misguided by Muslim leaders, especially of PFI and SDPI. They are giving a communal angle to every incident -- whether it is sexual harassment of a minor or sedition. They are trying to create a rift between the communities.”PFI state president Kafeel Raza countered this with, “The state government introduced MP Freedom of Religion Act against Love Jihad that give a message to the society that Muslim men are targeting Hindu women.”Some political experts believe the BJP, which lost its stronghold of Malwa in the last assembly elections, is trying to win it back by following a model based on UP’s Yogi Adityanath government even as some Muslim organisations are seeking to establish themselves before the local body elections.BJP, which won 56 out of 66 seats in Malwa Nimar region in 2013 assembly elections, lost 28 seats in 2018. It salvaged its position a bit by winning six out of seven seats in 2020 by-elections, but still has only 34 seats in the region.Political expert LS Hardenia said, “BJP-led state government of MP is following the UP model. BJP leaders in state are trying to win the next assembly election by promoting hard Hindutva. Meanwhile, AIMIM is trying to contest local body election in MP and that’s why, its chief Asaduddin Owaisi tweeted about the Indore incident as he wanted to stay relevant by showing sympathy.”Senior Congress leaders said the BJP is misusing power to create tension in the area. “Taslim Ali was beaten up in the afternoon and police registered the case at night...There is no doubt that BJP leaders are trying to create disturbance in the society to rule... They are misusing power to harass people of a minor community,” said JP Dhanopia, spokesperson MP Congress Committee. The BJP, however, calls it a political conspiracy. “If we go back in 2015, a sudden spurt in communal tension was reported in Malwa ahead of the local body elections. Again, with these polls in a few months, some local parties are trying to do the same now,” he added.Home minister Narottam Mishra, who has spoken of banning PFI and SDPI, said,“Congress and some anti-national organisations are trying to create disturbance not only in Malwa but across the state.” Senior police officials in Indore said social media is being used as a tool to promote communal tension. Indore and Ujjain police departments have issued at least six warnings against spreading incorrect messages on social media in the recent past.Indore inspector general of police HN Mishra said, “The number of cases is increasing as people of both communities misuse social media to circulate videos and photos with wrong captions. A small incident is being blown up so much that people react, leading to tension. But we have been able to control the situation in Indore.”(With inputs from Neha Jain in Indore)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/spurt-in-communal-incidents-in-madhya-pradesh-s-malwa-region-101630307383439.html
30-08-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: 5 dead, 2 missing after cloudburst in Pithoragarh||At least five people were killed after seven houses were hit by debris and muck from a landslide triggered by a cloudburst in Jumma village, in Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand, in the wee hours of Monday, officials familiar with the development said. A search using a sniffer dog is underway for two persons who are feared buried under the debris, they added. “The disaster occurred in Jamuni and Siroudiyar hamlets (Tok) in Jumma village of Dharchula area when debris and muck damaged seven houses. So far, five bodies -- three teenage girls and two women-- have been recovered. A search is on for other two missing persons,” Pithoragarh district magistrate (DM) Ashish Chauhan said. The affected village is around 125 km from the district headquarters. The search operation was halted at around 7.30 pm and will resume on Tuesday morning. District disaster management officer Bhupender Singh Mahar said the deceased were identified as Kumari Sanjana (15), Kumari Renu (11), Kumari Shivani (9), Sunita Singh (22) and Parvati Devi, whose age is yet to ascertained. The two missing are Chander Singh and his wife Hajari Devi, he added. Two of the four injured villagers were airlifted through a chopper and rushed to a hospital in Dharchula, the officials cited above said. On receiving information about the disaster on Monday morning, several teams of police, revenue, state disaster response force (SDRF) and national disaster response force (NDRF) rushed to the area to hold rescue operations. Seema Suraksha Bal (SSB) personnel were the first ones to reach the site to begin rescue operations. SSB commandant Mahendra Pratap Singh said: “We received information from the district disaster management officer at around 9 am after which our men posted at the border outpost, 10 kms away from Jumani hamlet, reached the spot at 10 am. Meanwhile, another team reached Siroudiyar hamlet, 2 km away from Jumani hamlet, after knowing that it too was affected by the cloudburst. Our men recovered the body of a younger woman. Later SDRF and NDRF joined the search and rescue operation. So far, five bodies have been recovered.” He added: “A team of 27 men carried out search and rescue work in the affected area.” Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami spoke to the Pithoragarh DM on phone and Kumaon commissioner Sushil Kumar via video conferencing, and directed them to shift the affected residents to safer areas and make arrangements for essential food supplies and medicines. Dhami is expected to visit the area once the weather improves.The district, which has received 1,170 mm rain since June 1, has been witnessing heavy rainfall for the past few days. Rivers such as Kali, Gori and Saryu have already begun flowing near the danger level. The incessant downpour has als triggered landslides and boulder falls, halting all movement in five border roads and 10 rural roads. Meanwhile, two children were trapped after their house in Kotda village in Dehradun’s Vikas Nagar area collapsed on Monday. Only one child was rescued till the time of filing this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/cloudburst-in-uttarakhand-7-feared-dead-3-bodies-recovered-101630306662981.html
30-08-2021||Bangalore||Not the ‘city of boiled beans’: A relook at the origin of Bengaluru’s name||According to one of the most popular stories of the origin of Bengaluru city’s name, an old woman living in the forest offered boiled beans and water to the 13th century king from the Hoysala dynasty, Veera Ballala II, quenching his hunger and thirst after he was lost during a hunting expedition. To express his gratitude, he named the forest “Benda Kaalu Ooru” or “Bendakaalooru”, which translates to The City of Boiled Beans, which, over the centuries became Bengaluru as the forest was replaced by a town and then a city.This folklore has been passed on for generations and often finds its way into the speeches of politicians, or in the trivia shared with the migrants to Silicon Valley. However, researchers and historians say there’s a need to set the record straight and separate folklore from research-based theories to trace the origin of the city’s name.However, even that is not simple since there are multiple theories based on different experts’ interpretations of historical facts and most of these have no corroboration in history.Chidananda Murthy proposed one of the popular historical theories behind the name. According to the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) officials, Murthy claimed that Bengaluru’s name may have been derived from the white quartz stones found in Balepet, Nagarthpet, and Chikpet areas of the city, resulting in it being called ‘Biliya Kallina Ooru’, or a city of white quartz stones. Over the years, it became Bengaluru, as per Murthy’s theory.Another theory claims that the city name originated from ‘Bengawaluru’, which means the place of the bodyguards. Its proponents argue that the army of the Hoysala empire, especially ‘Bengawalu Pade’ or the bodyguards of the rulers, had their garrison in the city, giving it the name Bengawalu, and Ooru-- a generally used in names of villages, towns, and cities-- was added to it over the years. However, like the previous one, this theory too doesn’t have any historical corroboration.SK Aruni, director of the ICHR south regional centre and a leading scholar in the city, has a different take. He points out that Venkatanatha or Venkateshwara of Tirupati was an important deity in south India, especially in Bengaluru.“If you look at old homes in Bengaluru, several houses were named after Venkatesha. He was a local deity, and over a period of time, Venakanaooru might have become Bengaluru. This is my theory,” said Aruni.Rajesh HG, a scholar, and editor of Itihasa Darapana said there was another theory that Bengaluru’s name originated from the Benga tree, known as Pterocarpus marsupium Roxb, which was once seen widely in the city. He said that it was argued that the city was called Benganooru (land of Benga), which later became Bengaluru.While the above theories are not corroborated by any historical evidence, there is one theory that all experts believe has the strongest claim since it is backed by a historical scripture.In Begur, located around 15 km from Bengaluru city, inside a temple, researchers discovered some inscriptions, specifically a ‘Veera Kallu’ or a Heroic Stone-- a slab depicting heroic acts of people. This stone dating back to the 890 AD depicts a battle scene named ‘Bengaluru Yuddha’ or the Battle of Bengaluru.The stone tells the story of Nagattara, who pledged his allegiance to Ereyappa Arasu, the Ganga ruler at the time. According to the inscription, in the Battle of Bengaluru in 890 AD, Nagattara’s son Buttanapati and adopted son Pervonasetti died.The Begur hero stone has carvings of battle scenes and war techniques, prepared by Ereyappa Arasu, and it says that Nagattara, too, died in the battle of Tumbepadi, fought between the dynasties of Gangas and Rashtrakutas. It also mentions 10 localities in Bengaluru, which were then villages and donated to another chieftain after Nagattara’s demise.Suresh Moona, a renowned historian, said this was a research-backed theory about the city’s name. “The city called Bengaluru existed as early as 800 AD, but it was not the city we know today. It is claimed that the mother of Kempe Gowda, the founder of Bengaluru city, was from old Bengaluru and when Gowda decided to build a new city, he named it after his mother’s birthplace, Bengaluru,” said Moona.He said that the theory was closer to truth because of the historical inscriptions.“Will we ever know where the name comes from? I don’t know. But these theories backed by a study of history should be promoted more and made into modern folklore instead of the one about boiled beans,” Moona added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/not-the-city-of-boiled-beans-a-relook-at-the-origin-of-bengaluru-s-name-101630306063095.html

30-08-2021||Patna||Permission sought for Ravan Vadh at Gandhi Maidan after virtual event last year||Shree Dussehra Committee Trust has asked the Patna divisional commissioner for permission to host Ravan Vadh at Gandhi Maidan on Vijaya Dashami, October 15 this year, following the reopening of religious places and institutions to the public since August 27 as part of Unlock-6—the sixth phase of relaxations following a sharp decline in fresh Covid-19 cases in the state.In a letter sent to the commissioner on August 24 this year, the committee has explained that organising Ravan Vadh ritual needs one and a half month of preparations, therefore the district administration needs to give early permission for the venue where the event will be held.Last year, the trust was not allowed to host Durga Puja in Patna due to the Covid-19 pandemic and Ramlila and Ravan Vadh functions were held virtually.“It was for the first time that we had to hold an online Ravan Vadh. The functions were held at Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh and those interested were requested to join it online,” Kamal Nopani, the Dussehra committee president, said.Nopani said there was still no clarity whether Ram Leela and Ravan Vadh will be allowed this year as a response to their request was awaited from the administration.“We will personally meet the official on Tuesday to request for the permission,” he added.The trust secretary Arun Kumar said the committee has been hosting Ramlila and Ravan Vadh for over 65 years in Patna and are a huge draw.“For months, people keep waiting for the shows, especially the Ravan Vadh. Many even turn up from rural areas to witness the burning of the effigies. To handle the huge crowd, we have to make elaborate and foolproof preparations. It needs time to arrange,” he said.He added that the committee was kept in suspense till the last moment last year and had to finally do a virtual show, which couldn’t match the joy of witnessing a live event in person.“This time, we want the events to be held at Gandhi Maidan and our hopes are high as all government and private organisations, schools, colleges, cinema halls, parks and temples have been allowed to reopen in Unlock-6. But the fear of the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic is also in the air,” he said.Patna divisional commissioner Sajay Kumar Agarwal could not be contacted for his comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/permission-sought-for-ravan-vadh-at-gandhi-maidan-after-virtual-event-last-year-101630298682737.html
30-08-2021||Patna||Bihar SHO suspended for settling road accident death case through negotiation||Station house officer (SHO) of Malahi police station in Bihar’s East Champaran district was suspended on Sunday after he tried to settle the case of a woman’s death, caused by a road accident, through negotiation in an apparent bid to save the motorcyclist involved in it.East Champaran superintendent of police (SP) Navin Chand Jha said Rajesh Kumar showed laxity, deviating from standard operating procedure (SOP) in handling a case of death, which occurred in a road accident.“He preferred not to register the case and no post-mortem was conducted. This was clear negligence and dereliction of duty on part of the SHO and a clear deviation from the standard operating procedure (SOP),” said Jha.The action was taken after the family members of the deceased woman complained to the SP that the local police were not taking any action against the motorcyclist allegedly responsible for the accident. Dhaniya Devi received multiple injuries when she was hit by a motorcycle near Sirni Brahmasthan under Malahi police station on August 24, and died later during treatment at a hospital in Pagarpur (in East Champaran).“Instead of taking action against the bike rider in the case, the SHO started pressuring the victim’s relatives to file an FIR against unknown persons. He did not take any action and the matter was hushed up through panchayati (negotiation). At the same time, the deceased’s body was cremated by her relatives without conducting a post-mortem so that the bike rider could be saved,” said a police officer, refusing to be identified.Suspended SHO Rajesh Kumar could not be contacted for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-sho-suspended-for-settling-road-accident-death-case-through-negotiation-101630295022613.html

The services of the Metro will be operated between 7am and 8pm and the trains will run at a frequency of 10 minutes between Kengeri and Baiyappanahalli. The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has estimated that 75,000 people would travel on the line every day, reports news agency PTI.Speaking at the inauguration, Puri noted that Bengaluru is one of the major engines of economic growth for the entire nation, with a strong presence in information technology, biotechnology and applied sciences research. He said, "The city accounts for nearly 38 per cent of total IT exports from the country… The inauguration of the Western Extension Metro Line today is a step towards enabling faster commute and smart mobility options in the city."The Union minister also noted that the operational punctuality of Bangalore Metro is 99.8 per cent. “Since the inauguration of the first metro line in Delhi in 2002, today about 730 km of metro lines are operational in 18 different cities and about 1,049km of Metro rail / RRTS projects are under construction in various cities,” he added.He further said that Metro is not only a lifeline of Bengaluru, it should be its "future line".

30-08-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The IIC man||Some people, both living and dead, embody within themselves the spirit of a place. Late architect Joseph Stein’s presence is intensely palpable about the corridors of the India International Center (IIC), one of the many New Delhi buildings he designed. In fact, the IIC is identifiable with quite a few characters. Such as scholar Kapila Vatsyayan, who died last year. IIC’s resident matriarch, the staff addressed her fondly as mataji.Another person inexorably entwined with this members-only institution is Aslam Khan. For decades, he was the face of its Main Dining Hall. Often standing behind the host’s desk, this gracious gent greeted the who’s who of Delhi society as they would saunter in with their VVIP comrades.“IIC is the sum total of my life,” Mr Khan says this afternoon, strolling on the pavement that runs along the IIC. “I spent more than 40 years here,” he says, gesturing towards the building. “I joined as a waiter in May, 1976, and retired as assistant manager in February, 2016.” Mr Khan received post-retirement extensions but quit during the first coronavirus-triggered lockdown last year in March.The IIC’s Dining Hall has been known for its courtly long-serving staffers acquainted with the eccentricities of their regular guests. The soft-spoken Mr Khan epitomises that grace. He recalls the time he spent in his “karmabhoomi,” the IIC. “When he once came to the Dining Hall, I asked him, ‘Are you (actor) Aamir Khan?’ After he nodded, I said, ‘I am Aslam Khan. I will show you your seat.” A few months after she lost the election in 1977, Mr Khan served former prime minister Indira Gandhi an apricot-filled meringue which the chef had named in her honour. Mr Khan recalls, “Madam asked me ‘Yeh kya hai? (What is this?)’ I said, ‘This is Gateau Indira. It is just like you—tough from the outside, soft from the inside.’ Madam started laughing.”Mr Khan has a treasure trove of similar IIC stories. “I know many, many small things of many, many big people.” The other day he received a call from an IIC patron asking him to book a table for three in the Dining Hall. Mr Khan explained he was no longer with the IIC. “I anyway arranged a booking for him by calling my contacts in the Dining Hall.”Now Mr Khan turns into a lane named after Joseph Stein, the IIC architect. He stands by the signage and poses for a portrait.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-iic-man-101630280503362.html
30-08-2021||Delhi||A month of weather fluctuations for Delhi||August has been a month of extremes for Delhi, said weather experts. Data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) for the 29 days of August so far shows that from having a monthly rain deficit of 60%, the city received 11% surplus rain before returning to an 11% deficit as on Sunday. But so far, the city has received just nine rainy days (rainfall above 0.16mm) this month, lower than usual for August, according to data from the weather office.IMD data shows the first half of August was largely dry, receiving less than half the normal rain the city usually gets during this time of the year, including a partial break phase that lasted for 10 days.The break ended with the city landing the wettest day of the season on August 21, receiving a record 138.8mm rainfall in a single day, which was the highest for the month in 14 years and the second highest since 1961. Within three days, however, the wet spell made way for another dry spell from August 25-28.On Sunday too, the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered representative of the Capital’s weather, did not receive any rain till 5.30pm despite the Met forecasting light, scattered rain.IMD scientists said that the major reason behind the dry phases was not having an intense monsoon system forming in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.“This year, there was no support in terms of continued easterly winds and moisture from the Bay of Bengal that trigger rain. Last year, we had five such systems forming, which resulted in good rains across the country. This season, we had just two such systems, which were not intense enough to travel up to central and northwest India. This has led to the northwest region experiencing weak monsoon spells,” said RK Jenamani, senior IMD scientist.Independent weather experts shared a similar view.“One of the major reason for the weak conditions is that both the frequency and intensity of the weather systems (low-pressure systems) formed in the Bay of Bengal this monsoon has been low. Every year during this season at least four to five such systems are formed, which travel up to central and northwest parts of the country bringing rain. This time only two such weather systems were formed, causing frequent weak phases,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, Skymet, a private weather forecaster.Until August 20, having received only 63.7mm rainfall, the city stood at a rain deficit of 60%. On August 21, the city recorded 138.8mm rainfall, which pushed the cumulative rainfall count for the month to 211.2mm (on August 22) against the normal count of 190.2 mm, reaching a surplus of 11%.It was followed by light rain over the following three days, after which the city again ran into a dry spell.On August 29, the city again stood at a monthly rain deficit, this time of 11%. From August 1-29, the city received 214.5mm rainfall, as against the normal count of 241.9 mm.IMD scientists say normally August brings the maximum monsoon rain to Delhi with a total monthly count of 247.7mm.“August may end with a slight deficit, as just two more days are left for it to be over and only light rain is expected over the next couple of days. There has been rain in some parts of Delhi, but it hasn’t been observed at Safdarjung Observatory. The city is likely to get patchy rain between August 30 and September 2,” said a senior IMD official on condition of anonymity.Scientists also say that the prolonged break phases that the monsoon season saw in the whole of northwest India also contributed to Delhi’s rain imbalance.The monsoon went into a break phase from August 9-19, then revived on August 20, and again entered a weak phase from August 25-28, the third for this season.Delhi saw the first break from June 29-July 12, delaying the onset of monsoon, which finally arrived in the national capital on July 13, over two weeks behind schedule.“Even though August is supposed to be the wettest month of the monsoon season for Delhi, the unusually frequent and prolonged breaks led to its weakening, resulting in hot and dry spells and above-normal temperatures. While humidity is already present in the atmosphere, in the absence of rain, the temperatures tend to rise. The weak monsoon spells, alternatively called partial breaks, usually tend to last for 4-5 days, but the one we saw this month was quite prolonged,” the IMD official said, adding that the season may see two to three small breaks, “but this year two breaks occurred within the same month, which also led to an extended number of dry days.”The August 21 downpour was too intense for a 24-hour period, he said, adding that such short and intense spells of rain have affected the number of rainy days occurring in a month. “Ideally this amount of rain should be more uniformly distributed over the month. More than 100mm rainfall must happen for a week or 15 days,” the official said.IMD data shows that over the past 10 years, only August 2007 saw just seven rainy days while the rest of the years had at least more than 10 rainy days in the month.“There could be a number of factors behind the frequent and prolonged breaks. The warming of the Indian Ocean at a higher rate could be one. Another could be the Madden-Julian Oscillation, or MJO location being unfavourable,” the IMD official added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/a-month-of-weather-fluctuations-for-delhi-101630276676964.html

30-08-2021||Chandigarh||Spice of life | For truth to dawn, detach and come to the centre||Krishna means one who attracts. He inspires people of all ages and walks, from playful children to elderly scholars. Krishna, the eighth avatar (incarnation) of Lord Vishnu, took birth to uplift and protect the good, destroy evil and re-establish dharma (righteousness). Krishna was born on a dark night when there was negativity everywhere but even 5,000 years on, his message for us serves as a guiding light to an inspired life. It is believed that the Mahabharata was composed by Rishi Ved Vyas to bring out Krishna’s greatness for its central piece is the Bhagavad Gita, the divine song. The Gita is a universal text that reminds all humans that we are born with the potential to be extraordinary. Of the 18 chapters, the second, Sankhya Yoga, is considered the summary of the Gita and its core theme is: Come to the centre. The 10th shloka (verse) of Chapter 2 is attributed to Sanjaya describing to Dhritarashtra how Lord Krishna smilingly steered the chariot of Arjuna, who represents the human race, between the armies of the Pandavas and the Kauravas in the battlefield of Kurukshetra. Tam-uvācha hṛiṣhīkeśhaḥ prahasanniva bhāratasenayorubhayor-madhye viṣhīdantam-idaṁ vachaḥIt is here that Lord Krishna delivers the sermon of the Gita to Arjuna, who is now bereft of arrogance and surrenders in devotion, so that he is able to take an objective view of the battle. Reality eludes us if we are attached to one side. Attachment leads to anger, fear and insecurity that distracts the mind from achieving its potential. For truth to dawn, we need to detach and come to the centre. We all have a different army or enemy to fight. Everyone’s battle or struggle is different. But if the mind is stithapragya or centred within, one experiences contentment and can act dispassionately and independently. Answering Arjuna’s question on how one recognises such a person, Lord Krishna describes the qualities of a leader in the last 18 shlokas of Chapter 2. He says such a person is content, level-headed and doesn’t get too attached to anyone. This enables one to be free to act without any obligation and pull in one’s limbs or senses like a tortoise to stay centred. Such a person is at peace and established in God despite the turmoil around and can maintain equanimity or regain calm faster to win the battle of life. The Gita exhorts us to assess situations objectively and act selflessly without worrying about the result over which we have no control. Every achiever, whether its javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra or weightlifter Mirabai Chanu, is focused and pours his/her heart into what he/she is doing. For such a person, life becomes a manifestation of joy. With a disciplined lifestyle, balanced mind, and spiritual connection, we discover our purpose. An illumined mind does not get bogged down with pinpricks such as other’s opinions and there is no hatred. This Shri Krishna Jayanti, may we commit to leading a life of value to others and serving divinity in everyone’s heart; may we bring joy to the community through our selfless action; and may we settle down to contemplate on the Eternal and enjoy the present. yyadav@hindustantimes.com The writer is senior news editor, Hindustan Times, Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/spice-of-life-for-truth-to-dawn-detach-and-come-to-the-centre-101630270001728.html
30-08-2021||Chandigarh||There should not be a communication gap between Delhi and Srinagar: Lone||People’s Conference chairperson Sajad Lone on Sunday said the masses were simmering with anger over the decisions taken on August 5. However, he stressed on the need of continued communication between the Centre and the people of the valley. Speaking to reporters after vice-chairman of district development Council (DDC), Kupwara, Farooq Ahmed Mir joined the PC, Lone said the mainstream parties in the union territory are powerless as on date. Lone said that after August 5, the political mainstream in J&K was on the back foot.On the disappointment among some political parties from Jammu and Kashmir over the outcome of the June 24 meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said he did not have any expectations from it in the first place.“Things do not remain the same and situations change. After August 5 (2019), the Kashmiri society and the polity – the mainstream parties – we are on the back foot. But, history is a witness, no society remains on the back foot forever. God willing, our time to play on the front foot will come and will come soon,” Lone said.“...it is a long game. Nothing started on August 5 and nothing ended on August 5. Things will go on, politics will go on,” he said. Responding to a question, the PC chairman said there is simmering anger among people against the decisions taken by the Centre on August 5, 2019 and it is “very dangerous”.“Anger is everywhere against the leadership. There is no place in the world where there is no anger against the existing leadership. Yes, our role is there (to defuse the anger), but as on date, we are powerless, we cannot do anything,” he said.On the outcome of the June 24 meeting of J&K’s mainstream parties with Modi, Lone said, “Disappointment after August 5 has galloped. I did not have any disillusionment about the all-party meeting. It was a social interaction, a political interaction and an exchange of ideas. I did not expect anything from the meeting.” “I did not think we could get anything from the meeting and I do not hold anything against them (other political parties) for expecting something from it and believing that it has not unfolded,” he said.The PC chairman said though the scope of the meeting was limited, he hoped that the Centre would follow it up with something concrete.“The need of the hour is that there should not be a communication gap between Delhi and Srinagar. It is very imperative that communication goes on,” he added.Welcoming Mir into the party fold, Lone said he has a lot of struggle behind him and is widely respected by the people in his area.“He has a lot of goodwill and is widely respected for the work he has done for his people. He secured more than 10,000 votes, the highest by any candidate in the Kashmir valley in the DDC elections. A number of prominent political leaders are joining the caravan of change,” the PC chairman said.Lone said he is confident that his party will be able to help the people of Jammu and Kashmir navigate through these difficult and challenging times.Mir said it is a matter of satisfaction that the PC is emerging as a formidable political force in Jammu and Kashmir.He said he genuinely believes that Lone is the only leader capable of taking the people of J&K out of the current situation.“I will work alongside the party’s rank and file to ensure that the party’s flag flies high across all regions of J&K,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/there-should-not-be-a-communication-gap-between-delhi-and-srinagar-lone-101630269341578.html

30-08-2021||Chandigarh||J&K allows colleges to resume offline classes||The Jammu and Kashmir administration on Sunday allowed institutes of higher education to resume “limited on-site” classes provided the students and staff are fully vaccinated. The administration, however, extended the closure of schools and coaching centres till further orders. Other educational institutions can allow attendance of vaccinated staff for administrative purposes.The institutions have been asked to organise vaccination camps in consultation with district administrations. In a series of measures aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 infection, the Jammu and Kashmir administration on April 18 had ordered closure of all educational institutions, including universities and colleges, till further ordersThe decisions were taken at a meeting chaired by chief secretary AK Mehta. He reiterated the need to continue with Covid containment measures in all the districts “in view of the uneven trend observed in daily Covid cases.” As per the latest orders, the maximum number of people permitted to attend any indoor or outdoor gathering shall continue to be restricted to 25 and while night curfew shall continue to remain in force in all the districts between 8pm to 7am, there shall be no weekend curfew in any district. It also decided to dispense with the mandatory testing for Covid at the entry point to the Union Territory at Lakhanpur for those who have received both dosages of vaccine and allow entry of vaccinated persons into public parks.District magistrates were directed to strictly ensure that there is full compliance with Covid-appropriate behaviour and defaulters are firmly dealt with under relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act and the Indian Penal Code.Directing for ‘no drop’ in Covid-19 testing levels, Mehta said deputy commissioners would also focus on the positivity rates of the medical-blocks under their jurisdictions.The order said the DCs would keep active track of the positivity rates in blocks and consider implementing stricter control measures in closed clustered spaces like public or private offices, community halls, malls and bazaars in case weekly positivity rate goes beyond 4% in these blocks. The officials have been asked to also focus on second dose vaccination.“Intensive vaccination drives shall be taken up in all districts to ensure timely administration of second dose besides maximizing first dose to vulnerable groups,” the order stated. The department of health and medical education, J&K, has been asked to ensure adequate availability of Covid dedicated health and logistics including ambulatory infrastructure based on their assessment of the case trajectory.J&K witnesses 169 fresh cases 
30-08-2021||Other||Our take| Way out of tricity’s traffic maze together||Last week, the Chandigarh administration decided to go in for a fresh study on a mass rapid transit system (MRTS) suitable for City Beautiful. With a population of over 12 lakh and 15 lakh registered vehicles, Chandigarh has the highest density of vehicles per household in the country, leading to traffic congestion. In addition, over two lakh vehicles on inter-state routes cross the city daily. With neighbouring Mohali and Panchkula piggybacking on its transport infrastructure as residents commute to and fro daily, it is prudent to involve both satellite cities while developing a plan for the UT. Since the metro rail plan was shelved, the UT administration has not been able to opt for any alternative, including monorail, skybus or metrolite. The Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES) report of 2009 on the city’s mobility needs is outdated as Chandigarh’s periphery has transformed. A fresh look at the traffic congestion in the tricity is imperative in view of its contiguous border with Mohali and Panchkula. Fast on growth, slow on mobility Mohali district’s population has grown to 15 lakh in a decade. Private housing societies in Kharar, New Chandigarh, Zirakpur and Dera Bassi besides Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) have come up and it has become a BPO industry hub with a large migrant population, comprising mostly young professionals. Yet, Mohali does not have its own transport system and is entirely dependent on Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) buses. On the other hand, Panchkula district has also grown manifold. The town has expanded beyond the Ghaggar river. The Barwala belt is also seeing rapid development and housing societies in Pinjore that have added to the need for a fast-track transport system. Though the fleet of buses has been increased to 189, including 32 local buses, a coordinated approach to a transport solution is needed. Debate question Should UT involve Mohali and Panckhkula in its MRTS plan?A new study on Chandigarh’s mass rapid transit system has been initiated and the administration is ready to go it alone on the project. Is it a good idea or should Panchkula and Mohali be on board, too?

Chandigarh Police inspector Narinder Patial, the station house officer (SHO) at Sector 31, recently provided bicycles, school uniforms and stationery to two girl students from a needy family of Ram Darbar studying in Class 9.

The inspector had been feeding stray animals as well during the lockdown. Feather in weatherman’s cap: Trip to South PoleManmohan Singh, the new Indian Meteorological Department director in Chandigarh, has served a stint in Antarctica. Singh, who was the IMD head in Shimla before landing in Chandigarh, recalled his 14-month stay at the Indian base in the ice-bound continent as part of the IMD expedition in the ’90s to study the weather there. “Just getting there took over a month by ship from Goa. The temperature can go down to -30 to -40 degrees on an average in winter and can rise up to 8 or 9 degrees on a summer day. The winds there are also very strong, and all structures have to be specially built to resist them,” he said. Now, that’s one trip of a lifetime. Communication gap at AAP press meet Last week, the Chandigarh unit of the Aam Aadmi Party called a press conference to announce “a very important decision”. Local journalists turned up at the party’s Sector 39 office in anticipation of a breaking news, but the press meet turned out to be more about the AAP’s activities in poll-bound Punjab. The Chandigarh AAP leaders looked on sheepishly. “Next time, we will hold a press conference separately from the Punjab one. There was a communication gap,” one of them shared later, requesting anonymity. ‘Efficient’ Mohali MC clears 9 agenda items in 20 minutes! During the monthly house meeting of the Municipal Corporation of Mohali on August 26, 50 councillors approved nine items on the agenda in 20 minutes flat. Not a single item was discussed. The councillors from the opposition did not raise any objection to any agenda item. The meeting began at 3pm and was over at 3.20pm. It seems the councillors had not read the items on the agenda before coming for the meeting. Baba’s fan following It’s been seven months since Baba Labh Singh has been protesting at Matka Chowk.

Passengers travelling in buses on GT Road also had a tough time with most seen getting off the bus and walking towards their destination, with luggage in their hands. Those in private vehicles didn’t have any option but to wait for the protest to end.Heated argument between farmers, BSP workers:A heated argument broke out between farmers and supporters of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) at the toll plaza as the latter asked for the blockade to be lifted. This irked the farmers who squatted in front of the vehicles of BSP supporters, thereby triggering a clash. However, leaders from both groups intervened and resolved the matter.Later, BKU leader Gurnam Singh Charuni said that some RSS and BJP workers were trying to sabotage the farmers’ protest by creating a ruckus. He said that no BSP worker or farmer was involved in any scuffle.Commuters on the receiving endIn the stand-off between the farmers and government, it was the common man who bore the brunt. Deepak, a commuter headed to Jalandhar, said, “The government has made no efforts to mitigate the farmers’ issue. Because of continued protests, both trade and agriculture have suffered massive losses.” Referring to a video in which the Karnal sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) was purportedly seen ordering police personnel to “break the heads” of protesting farmers, Deepak said, “While the SDM is now sitting in his air-conditioned (AC) room, it is the common man who has been left to suffer in this scorching heat.” Similarly, Gurpreet, a resident of Phagwara who was walking from Ludhiana side, said, “I was aware of the protest but I got late. The bus I was travelling in was stopped at Ladhowal Chowk. After waiting for half-an-hour, I decided to walk on the other side of the road. The volunteers at the protest site offered me refreshments while I was walking.”Among those stranded was a groom who was travelling to Nawanshahr along with his relatives. “The farm law issue has become a matter of egos. Both government and farmers are refusing to relent and it is the common man who is suffering,” said the groom.Tarsem Singh, a factory employee from Jalandhar who was stuck in Ludhiana due to the absence of transportation service, said, “I forgot that there was a farmers’ protest today. I came here for some work a few days ago and planned to return today. On reaching Jalandhar Bypass, I learnt that due to protests, the transportation services have been stalled. I don’t know what to do now.”Though roads were blocked for public movement, farmers cleared the passage for ambulances.Simmering angerSaudagar Singh Ghudani from BKU Ugrahan said, “The agitation is no longer a farmers’ protest; it has taken the shape of a non-violent civil resistance. People are reaching the protest site to show solidarity with farmers. But we regret the inconvenience caused to the public.”Women join in large numbersA huge number of women also joined the protest and raised slogans against SDM Ayush Sinha, who had purportedly instructed the police to break the head of the protestors. The protesting women demanded sacking and immediate arrest of SDM Sinha.“The protesting woman said the government should set an example so that such an incident is not repeated again,” said Parminder Kaur of Sidhwan Kalan.At 2pm, the protesting farmers decided to lift the blockade.

Mental preparation holds significance. If the team takes one game at a time and aims for consistency in doing well, I am sure the season will be a success.”On the team’s performance, Bhave said, “I have seen Punjab players in recent years. They are a bunch of skilful cricketers and need to play to their potential. It would be exciting to work with the team, selectors as well as the association.”Bhave was a member of the national selection panel that picked the World Cup champion squad in 2011. Now, he says he will be prepared well ahead of the season as head coach of the Punjab team, especially after taking the National Cricket Academy’s Fast-Track Hybrid Level-2 coaches course in Bengaluru.3 major tournaments to take place this seasonLast season, Ranji Trophy did not take place due to the pandemic while the Vijay Hazare Trophy and Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy were organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India. This season, however, all three tournaments will take place.“It’s great that players are getting to play all three major tournaments this season. I have been a typical West Zone batsman and adjusted well to multi-day cricket. I would apply this West Zone attitude on the Punjab team according to which they will have to spend a lot of time on the crease and go for big runs. Punjab has talented bowlers who can set up a game,” said 55-year-old Bhave, who played for his home state Maharashtra from 1986 to 2001.A right-handed opening batsman, noted for his prolific run-scoring and ability to build large innings, Bhave played 97 first-class matches and took Maharashtra to the final of the Ranji Trophy in 1992-93, where they lost to Punjab in Ludhiana.Incidentally, Bhave is the third coach after Intikhab Alam and Ajay Ratra to be hired by PCA from outside the region.

Almost all temples will celebrate the festival while adhering to Covid safety norms. City president of Hindu Parv Mahasabha, BP Arora said, “All temples will hold events between 10pm and 12am and some functions will be organised in the daytime too. Footfall has started increasing and we have also begun a weekly langar.” ISKCON temple in Sector 36 will also be open for the devotees this year. Akrur Nandan Das, president of the temple, said, “We have put up barricades going up to a kilometre from the temple’s entrance to ensure that we can control the crowd. Devotees will be allowed to pay obeisance on Monday, but they’ll have to leave immediately and there will be no seating arrangement in the temple, even for langar.” Like last year, all ceremonies will be live-streamed.Though in previous years, carnivals used to be organised in various parts of the city, no such event will take place this time, said Hindu Parv Mahasabha chief Arora. However, a few ‘jhankis’ will be there outside some of the temples for children, he added. Meanwhile, Shyam Sunder, joint secretary of Sri Laxmi Narayan Temple in Sector 20, said he doesn’t expect many children to come in for the celebrations as parents are still wary of the virus as the kids haven’t been vaccinated yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-temples-scale-up-janmashtami-celebrations-101630265681449.html

30-08-2021||Chandigarh||Beating all odds, Chandigarh lad wins gold at Asian boxing meet||Working in the kitchen of a Mohali restaurant on a busy Sunday evening, cook Jai Prakash kept waiting for a call from his 15-year-old son. Miles away, his son Rohit Chamoli was vying for a gold at the ASBC Asian Youth and Junior Boxing Championships in Dubai. Competing in the 48-kg weight category, the young boxer was pitted against Otgonbayar Tuvshinzaya of Mangolia in the final bout. When the 15-year-old finally called to inform his father that he had won the gold medal for India, Jai Prakash had tears in his eyes. He immediately called up Rohit’s coach Joginder Kumar to congratulate and thank him for his persistent training and support.“Coach ko bhadhai ho. Unki wajah se aaj Rohit gold le paya hai itne bade level pe (Kudos to the coach! It’s because of him that Rohit could win a gold in an international tournament),” said Jai Prakash. “We never had money to buy shoes or gloves for him. Coach Sir helped us, and see how Rohit has done us proud now.”Jai Prakash wanted his son to focus on education and not on the sport, but it was on the coach’s insistence that Rohit stuck to boxing. Rohit’s fascination grew for the sport when he saw his uncle’s daughter Meenakshi win a bronze in the Junior National Tournament and also fetch a job with the Indo-Tibetan Border Police later on.“Rohit has hunger in him. He won gold for Chandigarh in the Junior Nationals at Sonepat last month, and carried forward his fine form. I have been training him for four years and never saw him break down due to poverty,” said Joginder, who is a former national-level boxer and an assistant sub-inspector with Punjab Police. He has been coaching underprivileged children, including Rohit’s cousin Meenakshi, at Bouganvillea Garden in Sector 3, Chandigarh, for 12 years.‘Want to win Olympic gold for my father’In Dubai, after making a cautious start, Chamoli’s timely and precise punches gave him edge over his Mongolian opponent in a close-fought match that he managed to win 3-2. While handing India the first gold of the competition, he also won USD 4,000 (around ₹2.95 lakh) prize money. “The pandemic has affected my income. Last year, I lost my job as a cook at the place where I had worked for five years. It was tough to sustain with three kids pursuing education. I did odd jobs to earn bread and found another job in a restaurant in Mohali a few months ago. Even during this struggling phase, when at times we didn’t even have anything to eat, we encouraged Rohit to follow the sport,” said Jai Prakash, who lives in Mohali’s Nayagaon area with his family.Rohit studies in Class 11 at Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 16, and thus represents Chandigarh at the national level. Speaking over the phone after his win, Rohit said: “I am so thrilled to take gold. I just want to go home and show the medal to my family and coach. They have done a lot for me. I have trained in torn shoes and used old gloves in the park to learn boxing. My confidence grew when I took part in inter-school tournaments and won medals. I want to upgrade my training and one day win an Olympic medal for my father, who has sacrificed so much.” “Now that Rohit has shined at an international tournament, the Boxing Federation of India will call him for camps and provide modern training,” said coach Joginder Kumar. “He should be groomed for more international tournaments. Meanwhile, I will keep training other underprivileged children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/beating-all-odds-chandigarh-lad-wins-gold-at-asian-boxing-meet-101630265621406.html

30-08-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal orchardists fear Washington, Iranian apples may steal the show||Already reeling due to a steep fall in prices, orchardists in Himachal are facing a double threat from Washington and Iranian varieties of apples, with the former being sold at a premium, and the latter, which is cheaply priced, ready to flood the markets. For the last two years, homegrown apples have been facing a stiff competition from duty-free fruits being imported from Iran under the India-Afghanistan Free Trade Agreement. Large consignments of apples are also shipped to ports in Gujarat and Maharashtra, while some are routed to markets in north India through the Wagah border. It is mostly the Red Delicious variety grown in Iran, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan that makes its way into India. Despite numerous representations to the Centre by orchardists in Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh duty-free import of fruits has not been rolled back. Impose non-tarrif barriers: Orchardists Iran had a bumper apple crop this year, due to which it is expected that the variety will flood the Indian market this year. Besides, the variety is cheaply priced due to US sanctions. Some Indian companies have signed agreements to buy Iranian apples for as low as ₹ 20/kg. “These apples will start arriving in September. The government should immediately impose non-tariff barriers to stop the import of Iranian apples. If timely measures are not taken, the apples growers of Himachal, Uttarakhand and J&K will be ruined,” said Parkash Thakur, former vice-chairperson Horticulture Produce Marketing and Processing Corporation (HPMC) and former Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) director. “If the import of other goods can be stopped under the anti-dumping laws why not Iranian apples” says said. Pricing discrepancy With the apple markets crashing, the price of apples has fallen to ₹1,000- ₹1200 per box. Apples boxes weighing 22-35 kg are being sold for ₹500 to ₹1,200 in local markets, whereas consumers in cities are paying much more. On the other hand, the same strain of delicious red apples, branded as Washington Apples, are being sold for ₹4,000 per 20-kg box by the same middlemen. This because the imported apples come at a pre-determined price, which is decided and paid in advance at the time of import. Abhinav Jaggi, a Delhi-based businessman, who owns a cold storage chain, says, “This year Iran, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan had a bumper crop. Last year, Himachal saw a low yield, so Iranian apples became attractions for both wholesalers as well as retailers as the varieties are priced low.”The state government is blaming poor quality of apples for the low prices, but farmers say they are not getting their due for even premium quality apples. ‘Cartelisation to blame’ Fruit growers say cartelisation is responsible for the drop in price and have demanded that the nexus between traders and commission agents who manipulate the market be arrested. “Farmers should also try to improve the marketing setup,” said Thakur, adding that if farmers do not come together to grab the bull by the horns, their future will remain bleak. Successive governments in Himachal have made efforts to help farmers to market their produce, but unfortunately these government agencies cannot compete with the private sector because of the inherent problems in the government sector. Corporations like HPMC were set up to meet the post harvest needs of the farmers.

30-08-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn links services with vax certificate or -ve report||Carrying a Covid-19 vaccination certificate of at least the first dose or a negative RT-PCR test report that is not older than 72 hours has been made mandatory to visit government offices to avail any service in Chandigarh.The order is part of several directions issued by UT adviser Dharam Pal in anticipation of a third Covid-19 wave. Addressed to all the departments, the order was issued by the personnel department on Saturday and will come into effect once government offices open on Tuesday. People visiting the estate office, Registration and Licensing Authority and municipal corporation to avail themselves of a slew of services such as registering a property, getting a driver’s licence or vehicle registration certificate or a birth or death certificate are likely to be the most affected.“It will give an added incentive to people to get vaccinated at the earliest so that they can access these offices and services provided by them. Online services will not to be affected by this order,” said a senior UT official.The adviser has also ordered that for other services, such as using Chandigarh Transport Undertaking buses on both local and long routes, strict Covid-19 protocol has to be followed. No passenger or crew will be allowed to board buses without wearing face masks.Stating that the administration doesn’t want to be caught off guard if and when the third wave hits the city, Pal said: “There are indications that a third wave is likely to hit. Internationally, like in the US, Covid-19 cases, especially of the Delta variant, are increasing. There is an uptick in the all-India figures too. So, this could be the start of a third wave, though we hope it is not. But we don’t want to take any chances.”The administration had come under severe criticism for not anticipating the second wave in the city and not preparing enough for it. “Even on the eve of the second wave, people were saying the city had very low cases. At present, the city is doing fine, but we want to be prepared for any eventuality,” said Pal.The second wave started in March this year and peaked in May with 17,399 cases and 275 deaths. There has been a consistent drop in both cases and fatalities in the following months. In August, the city has been reporting new cases in single digit and there have been just two casualties.Step up vaccination, check preparednessThe adviser has also ordered stepping up of the vaccination drive in the city. “I have told the director health services to accelerate the pace of the vaccination. I also appeal to the citizens to come forward and take both doses. This is the most important preventive step,” said Pal.While the city has already achieved its first dose target, with around 109% eligible beneficiaries (including migrants) inoculated, the second dose coverage stands at 41%. “We are doing fine in vaccination drive. Our target was to complete the second dose vaccination by December 15. However, I have told the health department to complete this process as early as possible,” said the adviser.The health department has also been directed to review their preparedness for the third wave, by taking stock of Covid beds, medicines and medical oxygen supply.“In my assessment, we are reasonably prepared for a surge this time around. Medical oxygen plants are ready. For liquid oxygen supply, contracts are in place. Covid bed capacity has been enhanced at a number of places. Separate wards for children have been created. Buffer stock of Covid medicine has also been created. But a review will ensure that there are no shortcomings,” said Pal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-links-services-with-vax-certificate-or-ve-report-101630264601256.html
30-08-2021||Mumbai||Trash mountains: another type of Mumbai high rise||Mumbai, 1896: “A tide of rats overwhelmed the city following the retreat of the monsoon. They ran “about the streets… issuing from drains, gutters in a sick or dying state,” the British municipal report noted. The result was one of the deadliest pandemics to hit what was then Bombay. The dead rats were found with buboes or swellings, which doctors began noticing on fever-stricken patients. The Bubonic plague claimed more than 1,900 people each week that year. Then, as now, home isolation and quarantining was necessary medical procedure. But the colonial government undertook measures often by force, which led to a mass exodus of people from the city that had, by the turn of the century, become a centre for migrants from around the country. The British had built a fort, reclaimed land from the sea to join the islands and, on the sliver that emerged, built stately European buildings. Outside the fort, the lanes were packed with Indian migrants, drawn from around the country by the promise of work. Over time, the garbage dumping grounds at Mahalaxmi, where Mumbaiites had sent their garbage for years, swelled into the homes around it. Early in 1897, with the plague cases rising, the British officers identified a marshland in the distant seaside village of Deonar, where Bombay’s waste could be sent henceforth. The government acquired the land from its owner, Ardeshir Cursetji Cama, in May. A bund, or embankment, was built along the edges of the Deonar grounds to keep the sea from seeping into the site, and the garbage from flowing into the creek. “Cuchra” or trash trains began arriving at the Deonar grounds on June 7, 1899. “One great danger to the public health will be removed with the removal of the refuse,” official reports said. Over the century, the grounds have risen with the city’s trash making mountains of garbage nearly as tall as 18-storey buildings. Spread over 300 acres, it’s a township that houses Mumbai’s castaway belongings, diseases and people. Inhabiting the landfill From the late 1960s, the municipality began to relocate Mumbai’s pavement and slum dwellers to Deonar allotting them plots of land: those who came from Umarkhadi called their settlement, near the gate of the dumping ground, Umarkhadi. Others who were sent from Bandra called theirs Bandra Plot. The settlers began to trawl through the grounds to sort and resell cloth scraps, paper and metal as a means of earning a livelihood. As the decades passed, the city’s trash changed: cloth scraps shrank on the mountains, plastic — broken televisions, squashed bottles and plastic sheets —increased. These didn’t meld into the earth as food and cloth did, but only fed the growing mountains. Deonar is one of Asia’s largest dumping grounds and is probably its oldest too. It reflects the dizzying growth and swelling desires of a city. The landfill currently holds between 13 million to 16 million tonnes of garbage, with at least 2000 Metric Tonnes (MT) added to it daily. But the absence of a waste management system has begun to hurt the city, starting with the lives of the people living closest to the landfill. Some of the most common ailments to be found among the residents here include asthma, multiple drug resistant tuberculosis, cuts, bruises and eye disorders. Several studies have been conducted over the years to assess the impact of the landfill on the city. A 2012 study showed that benzene, a carcinogenic, festered in the mountain air, many times greater than at any of the landfills the authors looked at elsewhere in the world. Medical studies from 2009 showed the haze around the mountain was thick with the carcinogenic chemical, formaldehyde. Most recently, a paper published in the Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health journal pointed out that people staying in the vicinity of dumping ground within the radius of a kilometre (“exposed group”) had more instances of respiratory illnesses, eye disorders and gastrointestinal problems than a group from a distant community living with similar socio-economic conditions.One hundred and twenty two years since it first came as the result of a plague, a new pandemic grips the city. The grounds now house the waste of a new disease: face masks, sanitizer bottles and latex gloves; more plastic and organic waste from hospitals and homes. Around 2005, the civic body made a waste processing facility at Kanjurmarg, where more than 80% of the city’s waste is currently processed. Efforts to build such a waste-to-power plant for the Deonar landfill waste have been on for well over three decades, yet a plant is still to come up.

30-08-2021||Chandigarh||Canada gurdwaras’ council against plan to print ‘saroops’ abroad||As many as 20 managing committees of gurdwaras in Canada have expressed their disenchantment with the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) over its plan to allow printing of holy ‘saroops’ of Guru Granth Sahib in foreign countries. In a meeting held on August 23, the SGPC executive committee had resolved to set up the presses in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and some European countries, citing the “long-pending demand” of the Sikh diaspora. Taking exception to the plan, representatives of British Columbia Gurdwaras’ Council comprising 20 shrine bodies, has written to SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur, saying the holy saroops were available as required. “Some people in Canada are misguiding the SGPC that there is dire need for printing saroops there. This is not a reality. If any devotee in Canada wants to install the saroop at home, he or she can contact us. We are able to meet this requirement. Before printing more saroops, there is need to ensure that the existing ones are being given due respect and sanctity,” said Moninder Singh, spokesperson of the council. As per an edict issued by the Akal Takht in 1998, the rights of printing the saroops are reserved with the SGPC and any other institution seeking to do so has to take permission of the apex gurdwara body. Canada-based Sikh leaders Ripudaman Singh Malik and Balwant Singh Pandher have been demanding printing of saroops there. Around a year ago, they printed the saroops without taking permission from the SGPC. The Akal Takht had taken a strong notice of this as it angered the Sikhs in Canada. On Takht’s direction, the press and saroops were confiscated from their custody and shifted to a gurdwara in Surrey. The Canadian gurdwara bodies see Malik and Pandher influence behind the SGPC plan. Malik who runs Khalsa schools in Canada and was acquitted in 1985 Air India Kanishka bombing by Canadian judiciary in 2005, has been in regular touch with some key SGPC office-bearers and officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/canada-gurdwaras-council-against-plan-to-print-saroops-abroad-101630264241222.html
30-08-2021||Chandigarh||Post-revamp: Hi-tech galleries at Jallianwala Bagh enthral visitors||Four museum galleries are the new attractions for the visitors at Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial that was reopened after renovation for the public on Sunday. The refurbished monument was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday through video conferencing. The galleries showcase the Jallianwala massacre and other key events of India’s freedom struggle through projection mapping and 3D representation, photographs and sculptural installations. At night, a light-and-sound show is another attraction at the revamped monument. “I had visited this place three years ago. Today’s Jallianwala bagh is different. The efforts made to display the history through modern techniques is amazing,” said Najar Singh, an elderly from Ludhiana. The garden has illumination and audio notes, besides the eye-catching landscaping and hardscaping. Naresh Kumar, who along with his family came to pay obeisance at Golden Temple situated in the vicinity, made an unscheduled halt after seeing the crowd at the entrance of the Jallianwala Bagh. “I am feeling fortunate for getting the opportunity to visit this place sanctified with the blood of the patriots,” he said. Meanwhile, the activists have also been alleging that the Union government has vanished originality of the national monument in the name of its renovation. They opposed the new look given to the narrow lane through which the British troops entered the garden to shoot at thousands of Indians assembled there on April 13, 1919. The redevelopment was done to mark the centenary of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. No clarity on entry ticket Even as Rajya Sabha MP and trustee of Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust, Shwait Malik, had assured free entryto the after reopening, four ticket counters can be seen at the entrance of the memorial. Though Malik is reiterating free entry, security guards deployed there said the entry will be free for only a week and after that tickets will be available. Families of those killed in the massacre and activists have been opposing the paid entry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/postrevamp-hi-tech-galleries-at-jallianwala-bagh-enthral-visitors-101630263883873.html

30-08-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai court sends actor Armaan Kohli in NCB custody for one day||Bollywood actor and former Bigg Boss contestant Armaan Kohli, who was arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in a drug case, was remanded in the agency’s custody for a day by a local court on Sunday afternoon. NCB claimed that they have seized more than one gram of cocaine from the actor’s house during the raid. NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede led the raid at the actor’s bungalow situated in Vikas Park society at Juhu, on Saturday. The search started around 2pm and went on for six hours, during which a small quantity of cocaine was allegedly seized from his house. The raid was part of the agency’s ‘Rolling Thunder’ operation to bust the network of drug peddlers and suppliers in Mumbai, said Wankhede.NCB said on Sunday that in accordance with its zero-tolerance policy against drug trafficking in Mumbai, one major drug peddler, Ajay Raju Singh, was intercepted near Haji Ali and 25 grams of MD (Mephedrone) was allegedly recovered from him. Singh is a history sheeter and a huge quantity of ephedrine had been recovered from him by Mumbai’s anti-narcotics cell (ANC) in 2018, an NCB officer said. Singh had been supplying drugs to high-profile people, including in Bollywood, said the NCB officer. “We have been questioning him and scrutinising his call records to get more details about his drug connection,” added the officer. Kohli was a contestant on Bigg Boss 7 and made headlines for his volatile temper. He has starred in several films such as Dushman Zamana (1992), Anaam (1993), Qahar (1997) and Jaani Dushman: Ek Anokhi Kahani (2002).The raid on Kohli was based on Singh’s statement, the officer said. Kohli was questioned and arrested under contravention of small quantity of drugs, financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders, punishment for attempts to commit offences and for abetment, and criminal conspiracy under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.Under the Rolling Thunder drive, the agency has so far carried out 15 raids in the past two days and arrested eight people, including TV actor Gaurav Dixit and two Nigerian nationals. Contrabands such as MD, charas, MDMA (Methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and Ecstasy tables were seized during these raids, the NCB officer quoted above said.Dixit was arrested after his name cropped up during actor Ajaz Khan’s interrogation. MD and Charas were allegedly seized from Dixit’s house during a raid by the agency in April, after which he went absconding. Dixit was nabbed and produced in the court on Saturday and sent to NCB’s custody till Monday.Last year, several celebrities, including Deepika Padukone, Shraddha Kapoor, Sara Ali Khan and Rakul Preet Singh, were questioned by NCB in connection with an investigation into the alleged drug abuse in Bollywood, following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.The investigation so far has also revealed international links and NCB is probing the routes and contacts used to bring cocaine to Mumbai and the involvement of other traffickers, the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-court-sends-actor-armaan-kohli-in-ncb-custody-for-one-day-101630263461971.html
30-08-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: PAU hockey stadium to finally get a facelift||Punjab Agricultural University’s hockey stadium, which has been in a shabby state for the past several years, is finally set to get a ₹83 lakh renovation under the Smart City Mission. Built in honour of Olympian Prithipal Singh, the stadium’s infrastructure had been deteriorating due to government apathy and veteran players and residents had been demanding a makeover for the past four to five years. The municipal corporation (MC) has now issued work orders for the project, which will include renovation of changing room, shed rooms and washrooms; setting up irrigation system/sprinklers; chain-linked fencing around the ground; renovation of electrical system and installation of new control panel for water-pump room; installation of new light poles and retrofitting of existing light panels etc. MC officials said the project has been prepared after consultation with hockey veterans and Ludhiana hockey association and the renovation work will begin soon.Veteran players said the decision to renovate the ground has come as a major relief as the infrastructure was deteriorating and they have been seeking renovation for the last 4-5 years. The Astro turf is in playable condition but the sprinkler system does not work properly and most of the washrooms/changing rooms are also in a bad state. The chain-linked fencing around the ground also needs to be changed as the holes in the fencing are big and the ball passes through it. Windowpanes have also been broken at different points, which are an open invitation to trespassers, they said.Ludhiana hockey association secretary Ajaypal Singh and former hockey player Mohinder Gill said veteran players had been pitching in to maintain the ground until now.Appreciating the efforts being put in by MC to renovate the ground, the veteran hockey players said the administration should now make arrangements for maintenance after renovation.Former Olympian Hardeep Singh Grewal and veteran hockey player Jagbir Grewal said that hockey has now touched new heights with the performance of men’s and women’s hockey teams in Tokyo Olympics. “The administration should improve the hockey infrastructure in the district to attract more youngsters towards the sport,” said Jagbir Grewal.MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “Infrastructure for different sports is being developed or upgraded under the smart city mission. The projects are being planned after conducting field visits to ensure all issues being faced by players are resolved.”TT stadium to come up at sports complex near Rakh BaghThe municipal corporation (MC) has decided to establish a table tennis court at the sports complex near Rakh Bagh. It will come up under the Smart City Mission at a cost of ₹1.81 crores and work orders to start the construction have been issued. Municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said the facility will be ready in around six months.The project includes construction of new complex adjoining the shooting range, installation of sports, electrical equipment and lights and construction of a seating area. The roof of the TT court will be clubbed with the shooting range, to provide more space to the players. As per the Ludhiana District Table Tennis Association, there is currently a court on the first floor of the Shastri hall near Rakh Bagh, but the facility does match international standards. Under the new project, around a dozen tables will be provided to the players in comparison to four which are available at Shastri hall. Working secretary of the district association and international TT player Manmeet Singh, said, “The current facility is under Sports Authority of India, but it does not meet international standards. Establishment of a bigger facility will help improve our game, as the air speed in small and big facilities make a lot of difference. Also, the facility is being established as per the international standards. We have been seeking such a facility for a long time and the effort being put in by MC and cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu is appreciable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-pau-hockey-stadium-to-finally-get-a-facelift-101630263232584.html

Messages seeking support and taking digs at the opposition are also being circulated on social media platforms..On Sunday too, cocktail parties were organised by Chawla and Sachdeva groups at marriage palaces on Ferozepur Road and Dugri Road, respectively. There are 1,668 eligible voters for the elections this year and both groups say they have received overwhelming response to their campaigning efforts.Chawla group’s candidate for the post of president and current president of the association, DS Chawla said, “The other group has been promoting violence and politicising the association, which the members are against. We have been approaching all the members individually and are confident of victory.”Similarly, Sachdeva (United alliance) group’s candidate for post of President, Avtar Bhogal, said that the members want to see development, which has taken a backseat during Chawla’s tenure as president. “We will work to upgrade the bicycle industry after winning the elections.”Presiding officer for the elections, Parupkar Singh Ghumman said, “The members cannot organise a party at the UCPMA office, but the election committee has no jurisdiction outside the premises.

30-08-2021||Mumbai||Union minister Narayan Rane concludes yatra in Maharashtra||The face-off between Union micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) minister Narayan Rane and Shiv Sena continued on Sunday as his 10-day ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ culminated at his home turf Sindhudurg. Rane targeted Sena leader Sanjay Raut, saying if he doesn’t stop personal attacks through Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, he will let out secrets from his Marathi publication ‘Prahaar’. Rane also dismissed speculation that his mellow tone against the Sena chief was due to a meeting between chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis last Friday and said that getting soft or mellowing attacks is not in his DNA. On the other hand, Raut targeted the Centre over Rane’s ‘slap’ remark against Thackeray asking why Delhi was backing the ones who disrespect Maharashtra. The statement came in Raut’s weekly column ‘RokThok’, saying the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) leadership, including Amit Shah, JP Nadda, and Maharashtra leaders Fadnavis and state unit chief Chandrakant Patil, called action against Rane as “unconstitutional”. Raut in said that Rane’s sons were responsible for their father’s downfall. “Mr Rane’s sons have damaged his political career the most. Criticism and accepting it is a culture in parliamentary democracy, but Rane’s sons have brought up parents of leaders from Thackerays to Pawars to Rahul Gandhi and even Modi. This has damaged Rane the most. Soon such criticism will come from Fadnavis and Chandrakant Patil.” “An editorial is being printed against my sons. But he (Raut) should first understand what his children are doing. Both [my sons] are smart and educated...” Rane during his speeches in Kankavli and Dodamarg in Sindhudurg targeted Raut and said that he is leading the Sena towards a decline. “When he comes before me in Rajya Sabha, he says namaskar, and says, ‘I am with you’. He tells Uddhav Thackeray that he is a true Sainik then he quietly sneaks to Sharad Pawar’s office and tells him ‘I am with you’. Who are you with? He is a daily wager, a temporary employee,” Rane said. The union minister said that he received a rousing welcome wherever he went in his tour of Palghar, Mumbai, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts and said that Sena’s presence was hardly visible in Konkan. Referring to his arrest and subsequent bail after the ‘slap’ remark against Thackeray on Tuesday, Rane said that there was a “bad omen” when a “cat crossed his path”, the tour was a success. Rane also attacked deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar saying he was “ignorant”. Responding to Rane’s remark, Pawar told reporters, “He is a union minister, he must focus on his job, while we in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) are doing our work.” Raut also wrote in the party mouthpiece that Rane has been speaking in unparliamentary language against Sena chief and its leaders for over 20 years now. Raut said that Rane was arrested because he threatened Thackeray. Justifying the action taken by the Maharashtra government, he added that many people have been arrested for threatening Prime Minister Modi, Yogi Adityanath, and Devendra Fadnavis. As a policy of Maharashtra BJP, its spokesperson said they do not comment on Saamana editorial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/union-minister-narayan-rane-concludes-yatra-in-maharashtra-101630263224903.html
30-08-2021||Chandigarh||Manual scavenging in Ludhiana continues as MC, sewermen trade charges||Amid row over manual scavenging and lack of machinery and safety kits available with the municipal corporation (MC) to ensure safety of sewermen, the practice still rampant in the city despite being banned.As per MC officials, the civic body has 16 jetting machines and 32 manhole desilting machines for 95 wards, which are divided into 16 sub-zones. On an average, 25 to 30 complaints of clogged sewer lines are received everyday from each sub-zone. Around 1,700 contractual and permanent sewermen are employed by the civic body and in absence of proper machinery, they are sometimes forced to clean manholes manually.Even though officials claim that the civic body has four shoulder mounted oxygen sets, 148 safety belts, 25 air breathing kits, 150 safety helmets and 47 gas masks among other equipment, these are not being put to use adequately. While officials claim that the sewermen do not use the equipment as it becomes difficult to work with the gear on, the sewermen allege that it is not provided to them. Most times, sewermen are seen entering manholes with only a safety belt, which is used to pull them out if lose consciousness after inhaling poisonous gases.An MC official, requesting anonymity, said that they also try to avoid manual scavenging due to the risks involved. But, in some cases, it becomes impossible to clean the sewer line without entering the manhole in absence of proper machinery. “If something solid gets stuck inside the manhole, it has to be removed manually. Even if the line can be cleaned with the help of machinery, the sewerman has to enter to plug the manhole and stop the flow of sewerage.”MC Commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “Strict directions have been issued to the staffers to stop manual scavenging in the city and action will be taken against officials if an incident of a sewermen entering a manhole without safety kit is reported. Even if it is necessary to manually clean a sewer line, then a safety kit will be provided and the work will be done in the presence of a junior engineer or sub-divisional officer.”Non-availability of gas detectorsEven as a large number of accidents have reported in the past wherein the sewermen have died or lost consciousness while involved in manual scavenging, the civic body does not have gas detectors to check the presence of poisonous gases before the employee enters the manhole.Sabharwal said, “Apart from the machinery and equipment already available with the civic body, we are also purchasing 33 more kits worth around ₹2.5 crore, which will include oxygen cylinders, gas detector, cover all suits and safety belts. It is being purchased under the National Clean Air Program (NCAP).”Commission recommends FIR, seek details of equipmentAfter the Chairman of Punjab State Safai Karamchari Commission Geja Ram Valmiki found sewermen involved in manual scavenging in areas like Jugiana and Model Town in the last two months, the commission has recommended an FIR against MC officials concerned and sought information from the civic body regarding the machinery available and the safety equipment provided.Geja Ram said that around two weeks have elapsed after the report was sought by the commission, but the MC has failed to submit it. “A reminder will be sent and if they still fail to submit the details, action will be recommended against the officials concerned. Further, the commission will move court, if an FIR is not registered against the MC officials for forcing sewermen to enter the manhole,” said Ram.MC officials including executive engineers, sub-divisional officers and junior engineers also locked horns with Ram, after he recommended an FIR against the MC executive engineer and SDO for allegedly forcing the sewermen to enter manhole without safety kits in Jugiana area on July 16. The MC officials alleged that the chairman had forced the employees to enter the manhole, to implicate MC staffers.Councillors seek manual scavenging with safety kitsAfter the commission tightened noose around the MC over the illegal practice, civic body officials have issued strict directions to stop manual scavenging in the city. This has irked the councillors, especially those representing the outer wards of the city, as the MC is unable to clean the choked sewer lines due to lack of machinery. Now, with manual scavenging not allowed, accumulated sewage water on the streets is taking a toll on residents. Councillors including Paramjit Singh (ward number 28), Gurdeep Neetu (ward number 52) among others have been demanding manual scavenging of sewer lines after providing safety kits to sewermen.

30-08-2021||Lucknow||Women students outnumber men in Uttar Pradesh colleges, univs, says higher education directorate report||The constant efforts made over the past few decades to promote education among women and girls in Uttar Pradesh are finally starting to show results, officials have said.The latest data of the state’s higher education department shows that the girls and women enrolled in state universities and colleges affiliated to them in Uttar Pradesh far outnumber the men and boys, the officials said.In the past four years, the number of girls enrolling for higher education increased by 13%, they added.The latest report of the UP Higher Education Directorate sent to the state government said 27 state universities and 7,391 degree colleges of UP in 2020-21 session have a total of 50,21,277 students enrolled in them, out of which 62.95% are women. The count of men 18,60,220 (37%), they added. Four years ago, in the academic session 2017-18, there were a total of 55,74,638 registered students in UP’s higher educational institutions and the number included 27,77,137 women amounting to 49.81% as compared to 27,97,501 (50.18%) men, officials said.Director (higher education) Amit Bharadwaj said that a change in the social perception finally led to girls being encouraged to go for academics, making use of the various government schemes that allow free of cost education to girls right from schools to the college and university level.“Earlier, many parents were prompted to invest in boys’ education believing that they would support the home and be a pillar of strength during old age but with time and awareness, the realisation has finally sunk in that educated girls can not only be good professionals and support homes, but also lead a confident life of self-respect,” he added.Government data shows that this trend of rising number of girls in educational institutions in the state is also visible at the school level. The number of girls registering for UP Board’s class 10 exams has doubled in the past three decades.In 1991, UP Board had a total of 17,75,602 registered students for high school exams that included 14,04,519 boys (79.10%) and 3,71,083 girls (20.89%). However, in 2021, there were a total of 29,94,312 students registered for the class 10 exams that included 16,74,022 boys (55.90%) and 13,20,290 girls (44.09%). Psychologists also credit this situation to the change in the outlook of parents. “The change in the perception and outlook of parents is the main factor responsible for this welcome change over the years. Better social security being provided to girls is another reason for it. Earlier, parents residing in rural areas were especially reluctant in terms of educating girls, especially allowing them to pursue higher education. However, as the importance of education sunk in, and the various government initiatives, including free education, scholarships, systematic counselling as well as campaigns on radio, TV, all played their vital roles in bringing about this change,” said Dr Usha Chandra, director of the Bureau of Psychology, UP.This trend in UP is along the lines of the pattern being witnessed at the national level, said Prof Badri Narayan, noted social scientist and director of GB Pant Social Science Institute.He said the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) 2019-20 released in June 2021 showed that apart from more females being enrolled in MPhil, postgraduate and certificate level courses in universities and colleges, they were also continuing to dominate in medical sciences, BA and BSc programmes.“However, the share of female students is the lowest in institutes of national importance where there has been an overall increase of over 18% in female enrolment in higher education between 2015-16 and 2019-20 as per the report,” he said.The Gross Enrolment Ratio of females stands at 27.3%, which is better in comparison to that of males at 26.9%. The survey also found a very high and sharp increase of female participation at MA, MSc and MCom courses during the last five years, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/women-students-now-far-outnumber-men-in-uttar-pradesh-colleges-universities-says-high-education-department-report-101630263161290.html
30-08-2021||Mumbai||Operation Muskaan: Mumbai Police trace 12,278 of 13,005 missing kids since 2014||In 2014, Mumbai Police undertook a special drive – Operation Muskaan – to trace missing children who were found wandering in the city, and reunite them with their families. The missing children bureau traced 299 of the 346 kids reported missing in Mumbai.Since its inception till July this year, when the police conducted the 10th round of the special drive, 12,278 of the 13,005 missing children have been traced and about 4,000 of them have been reunited with their families under Operation Muskaan. Since 2014, 621 girls and 226 boys are missing.According to police officers, around 120 children – a maximum of whom are in the 10-18 age group – go missing in the city every month. In most of the cases, the police register a kidnapping case to compel investigation officers to put in more efforts to trace and/rescue the missing child.Operation Muskaan – which is being coordinated by Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Balsing Rajput, currently posted as deputy commissioner of police (preventive) in Mumbai crime branch – was launched by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).According to Rajput, there are at least 67 reasons why children go missing. These include kidnapping and abduction, which are done for various reasons such as trafficking, sexual exploitation, forced marriage and child labour. Another major reason behind children above the age of 15 years going missing is elopement. The other reasons include abusive families and unemployment within the families, owing to which children run away from their homes.Apart from the routine duties, all the 93 police stations in Mumbai have a dedicated team of a sub-inspector and four constables to trace the missing children.After tracing and rescuing the missing child, the police have to counsel and convince them to reveal their address or mobile numbers of their parents, which is the most difficult task in cases wherein a child has left home and away and does not wish to return.“We counsel the child, but when we find out that they don’t want to go home, we hand them over to the child welfare committee (CWC) to rehabilitate them,” said Rajput.If the child is ready to return to their house, it becomes the duty of the police officers to escort them to their house and reunite them with their parents or guardians.“The manpower is less but we make sure that the kid is accompanied by a police constable. If it’s a girl, a woman constable accompanies her to her house,” said Rajput.“We have an SOP (standard operating procedure) specifying the number of police officers who need to accompany the kid, depending on the distance of travel,” added Rajput.Talking about financial difficulties, Rajput said that earlier the money spent was shelled out by the police officers accompanying the child but now the police are given a budget or are refunded on their returns after the state decided to give them ‘investigation fund’ since 2015.“All the bills have to be maintained for the refund,” said Rajput.The amount spent includes train tickets of the police constables and the child along with food expanses, travel within the home town to trace or reunite the child and the staying expenses of the police officers which is about ₹5,000 per trip, according to the police.Apart from rescuing the kids and rehabilitating them, the police also follow up on their progress.“Even after rescuing them, many kids find their way back to the same streets and began begging or working. We follow up on the kids we rescue even if they are sent back to their homes in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar where parents are mostly responsible of throwing them back to the streets, especially in begging rackets,” said a police officer from the missing bureau of Mumbai Police which works along with several non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Maharashtra and other states as well as with CWC to make sure that a missing kid is back to where they are loved and nurtured.3 boys reunited with families in UPThree months ago during a police bandobast, a 10-year-old boy was spotted roaming around without an adult in Andheri (East).On searching him, the police found a stash of cash worth ₹10,000 in his bag. The boy’s dialect was difficult for the police to understand but they gauged that it was from Uttar Pradesh (UP). However, in spite of hours of counselling, the kid refused to divulge any details on how he came to Mumbai or where his parents were. The police then contacted a man from UP who served them tea and asked him to talk to the boy to understand his language, but the tea vendor, too, could not get the boy to reveal his address.On researching on the missing cases in Maharashtra and other states of India, especially UP, the police reached a breakthrough and learnt that three boys had fled from Phulpur village in UP on June 10. Two of the missing boys were traced in Valsad on July 2 and the third was still missing.When the boy in Mumbai was told about his friends in Valsad, he revealed that his parents used to hit him over studies. So he and his friends planned to leave their homes and come to Mumbai to look out for work. The boys had stolen all the cash they found at their respective houses before leaving. The other boys traced from Valsad were brought to Mumbai and handed over to CWC. On July 10, the police officers counselled the boy. Two constables took the three boys to UP where they were reunited with their parents.Teen flees to Bihar, reunited with parentsA 16-year-old girl from Dahisar was reported missing by her parents on April 15. The police officers registered a kidnapping case.On tracking the girl’s social media account, the police learnt that she had befriended a 16-year-old boy from Bihar and had been chatting with him. On asking the girl’s friends, the police officers learnt that the two had an affair and the girl had eloped with the boy.The police tracked the girl’s mobile phone to Darbhanga in Bihar, after she had switched it on. On May 10, a police team left for Darbhanga and four days later, the officers traced the couple to the boy’s house with the help of the local police. After counselling, the girl was reunited with her parents in Mumbai on June 15.As the boy was a minor, the police had handed him over to CWC for further action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/operation-muskaan-mumbai-police-trace-12-278-of-13-005-missing-kids-since-2014-101630262861420.html

30-08-2021||Bangalore||BJP Karnataka in-charge Arun Singh to visit Mysuru today||Arun Singh, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national general secretary in-charge of Karnataka will be visiting Mysuru on Monday as part of a tour in the region, the party said in a statement on Sunday. “BJP national general secretary in-charge of Karnataka, Arun Singh will arrive in Bengaluru international airport at 5.30 pm on Monday and will head to Mysuru and stay in the government guest house. On August 31 at 8 am, he will visit Chamundeshwari temple and then go to Mysuru, Mysuru rural and Chamarajanagar where will have meetings district level meetings with the core committee, mandal president and general secretary,” the statement said. He will then leave for Hassan and Mandya district before returning to Bengaluru. He will then head to Hubbali, return to Bengaluru and then head back to Delhi. The tour comes at a time when the BJP is holding meetings across the state to consolidate its support base ahead of the yet-to-be announced zilla and taluka panchayat elections in Karnataka which, political leaders and observers said, would give some indications on where each of the three major outfits in Karnataka stand before the 2023 assembly polls. At least three urban local body polls in Karnataka--Hubbali-Dharwad, Kalaburagi and Belagavi will go the polls on September 3. The BJP in Karnataka has been at the receiving end of criticism over the last two years under BS Yediyurappa, the infighting and allegations of corruption against the former chief minister and his family. The crisis within the party continued with the replacement of Yediyurappa with Basavaraj Bommai who appears to have inherited the same problems with legislators openly airing voices of dissent and Cabinet colleagues trying to hold the chief minister to ransom, demanding a change in portfolios. There is also unrest among the BJP legislators for having missed the Cabinet berths and continuing to make statements that have compounded the saffron outfits troubles in the state. The recent gang-rape case in Mysuru also saw several Cabinet ministers like Araga Jnanendra, Anand Singh and Shivaram Hebbar making statements questioning the victim and adding to its troubles. Chief minister Bommai , earlier had issued a stern warning against ministers making such comments that would further embarrass the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bjp-karnataka-in-charge-arun-singh-to-visit-mysuru-today-101630262741654.html
30-08-2021||Bangalore||B’luru Metro inauguration reignites language dispute||Bengaluru The inauguration of the metro extended line on Sunday has once again reignited the language controversy with the organisers and chief minister Basavaraj Bommai accused of sidelining the Kannada language. “It is a shame for Karnataka to ignore Kannada in our metro inauguration programme on the Kengeri purple Route. It is impossible to tolerate the sidelining of Kannada in a government programme. Our metro project is a Central and state partnership project. So why shouldn’t Kannada be a priority?” Dinesh Gundu Rao, the former Karnataka Congress president and in-charge of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry & Goa tweeted in Kannada on Sunday. The controversy erupted as the chief minister was heard speaking in English during much of the event and most of the posters behind were written mostly in English. Rao added that the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has been working from the beginning to insult Kannada and the language of the state was ignored in Sunday’s inauguration. He added that even the chief minister failed to show love for the language and allowed the programme to be conducted in English to please the centre or union government. “#BJP Regional languages are being suppressed in the BJP’s one-nation one-language concept. It is from this agenda that Kannada was insulted at the inauguration of today’s metro. But the Kannadigas do not tolerate any attempt to murder Kannada. Kannada is not just language, it is the soul of Kannadiga,” Rao said. Reacting to the series of tweets by Rao, (Retd) Capt. Ganesh Karnik, ex-MLC and chief spokesperson for the BJP in Karnataka told HT on Sunday, “The series of tweets in reaction to metro inaugural functions were not in good taste. The observation on the lapse in not having the stage banner in Kannada, which is a lapse on the part of metro authorities and they will be instructed to not make such mistakes in the future.” He further added, “Our party has no second thoughts and will never compromise on any issue pertaining to our language, our water & our land.” Karnik said that the issue was being blown out of proportion by the Congress legislator and that the chief minister had to make an appeal to the central minister Puri for further assistance, expansion and speedy completion of Namma Metro and chose to convince the central minister in English keeping the state’s interest in mind. “It is very mean & unbecoming of a leader who was a cabinet minister earlier and was also the state president of Congress party to post a series of tweets, in an attempt to rake up an emotional issue for political gains which needs to be condemned,” he added. The metro had become the face of this struggle in Karnataka in 2017 as the then Siddaramaiah-led Congress government had questioned the need for putting up signboards in Hindi and English on the trains, stations and other areas. The spark from Siddaramaiah against the Centre including devolution of taxes and languages in 2017 had created a unity of sorts among the five southern states. The sentiment was such that factions that had been warring over Cauvery water in both Tamil Nadu and Karnataka came together on a single platform to take on the Centre’s imposition that was viral on social media with #StopHindiImposition. Local groups in Karnataka, have even defaced billboards, stalled movie releases and opposed politicians and personalities who it considers anti-Kannada or anti-Karnataka in the past. The state has witnessed several such bandhs and movements since the 1980’s Gokak movement, named after a committee headed by VK Gokak. The Gokak agitation, led by the late Dr Rajkumar, one of Kannada cinema’s biggest stars, was a language -rights agitation that took place in the 1980’s that fought for primacy to be given to Kannada in state schools over Sanskrit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bluru-metro-inauguration-reignites-language-dispute-101630262623363.html
30-08-2021||Mumbai||Teachers raise red flag over dip in fundamental courses’ enrolments in Mumbai varsity||There is an overall declining trend in enrolment to regular courses in the University of Mumbai (MU). The enrolment data provided by the varsity in written replies to the questions by Bombay University and College Teachers Union (BUCTU) Senate members shows an overall decline of 13% from 2019-20 to 2020-21 in the entry point of regular courses in science, commerce and arts.Tapati Mukhopadhyay, president, Maharashtra Federation of University and College Teachers’ Organisation (MFUCTO) and Madhu Paranjape, general secretary, BUCTU, tell HT what the dipping numbers mean. What do the declining numbers for enrolment at the entry point for regular courses mean? How do we put the numbers in context of the Covid-19 pandemic?In case of Mumbai and Thane districts, the decline in entry-level enrolment is 13.8 and 13.9 %, respectively. The overall decline is highest for first-year (FY) BA (Bachelors of Arts) at 17.1%. Though there are inter-district variations in the enrolment, in Mumbai district, there is a decline in enrolment in all faculties. In regular courses like BA, BCom (Bachelor of Commerce) and BSc (Bachelor of Science) enrolment has declined from those registered in 2017-18 to 2018-19 and 2019-20. In absolute figures, the decline from 2019-20 (pre-pandemic period) to 2020-21 (pandemic and lockdown period) at entry level (first year) is 18,098.The enrolment trends in the three regular courses – BA, BCom and BSc – are completely opposite for the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. It is pertinent to note that these three courses account for the bulk of enrolment – 61% – in 2019-20.MU has been trying to increase the number of courses in Palghar and Sindhudurg. What do enrolment figures in different districts say about demand for courses?For science faculty, the overall decline in FY enrolment in BSc is 12%. However, it varies from almost nil in Palghar to 19% in Thane and 21.8% in Sindhudurg. The drop in enrolment from FY (2019-20) to second year (2020-21) is unusual since as per the state government’s decision, all students in intermediate semesters (FY to SY, SY to third year) were eligible for promotion to next class.The highest drop-out in BSc from FY to SY is in Mumbai district at 47.8%. Thus, despite 100% promotion, 3,553 FYBSc students in Mumbai did not take admission in SY in 2020-21. This drop in Raigad was at 17.1%, 15.6% in Sindhudurg, 14.2% in Ratnagiri, 11.4% in Thane and lowest in Palghar at 7.8%. Altogether, 4,944 students from FY science (27.2% ) did not take admission to SY.In the arts faculty, the district-wise decline in FYBA enrolment varies from 12.8% in Mumbai to 21.3% in Sindhudurg and 25.5% in Raigad. Further, the drop in enrolment from FY to SY is highest in arts faculty. District-wise, the proportions of this decline were 35.6% in Mumbai (3,486 dropped), 40.3% in Raigad, and varied from 24 to 29% in other districts.For commerce faculty, the FY enrolment in BCom has declined by 11.9%. However, district-wise it varies from a 2.5% increase in Ratnagiri to 14.6% decline in Mumbai. The highest enrolment of students in MU at entry point is in commerce faculty. There is a total drop of 17,236 students from FY to SY, which is 18.6 %.What do the percentages in decline mean?The average drop from SY to TY by 2.8% appears marginal. In absolute numbers it is 3,327. However, this may not reflect the actual decline. This is because the policy of unconditional promotion – necessitated by the lockdown – led to clearance of a backlog of admissions in final-year due to multiple ATKTs (allowed to keep terms) at intermediate semesters and added to the numbers admitted from SY to TY.Alarmingly, the total dip from FY to SY in BA, BCom and BSc stands at 31,021. This, coupled with the decline of 18,098 enrolments in FY, and 3,327 from SY to TY reveals that at least 49,119 students did not take admission in the colleges in MU in 2020-21.Which courses saw the least demand in 2020-21?The faculty-wise entry point data for all courses (aided and self-financing) from 2009-10 to 2017-18 shows an overall annual growth rate of 3.5%. There are faculty-wise variations.However, in the case of arts, the growth is not consistent. In fact, the pattern is that of overall decline. At the same time, in commerce, though the average growth has been of about 4%, it has not been consistent either.The enrolment in science courses, after a decline in 2010-12, has shown a consistent growth. This is to some extent connected with the oscillating enrolment in technology.What are your suggestions to the university?The critical situation of admissions in various colleges necessitated an analysis of the enrolment data. The drop of more than 50,000 students in BA/BCom/BSc, mostly from FY to SY, is an extremely disturbing trend and requires urgent steps by the university and government.However, the picture is incomplete. The current year’s enrolment data is crucial. If the above trend continues, many fundamental courses will lose the threshold of entry point and face closure. Ironically, it is at this juncture that MU has proposed a Perspective Plan to start 45 new arts, science and commerce colleges from 2022-23. In the present crisis, this will accelerate the closure of many subjects and then of existing aided colleges.While students will be deprived of higher education, several teachers will become surplus. It is imperative that the government takes new policy measures in consultation with all stakeholders to save institutions, subjects, students and staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/teachers-raise-red-flag-over-dip-in-fundamental-courses-enrolments-in-mumbai-varsity-101630262621163.html
30-08-2021||Bangalore||K’taka CM: Will personally take stock of mega projects in capital||Bengaluru Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Sunday said that he will personally monitor all ongoing mega projects in Bengaluru and even dedicate his first working hour of the day to supervise them.Speaking after the inauguration of the 7.5kms extended line of the Bengaluru metro, he said, “The first decision that I have taken, as far as Bengaluru is concerned, is that I will personally supervise the progress of all mega projects in Bengaluru, from (the) CMO (Chief Minister’s office). Within next 20 days my dashboard will be ready, day-to-day updates will be there and I will dedicate my first working hour of the day for supervising the progress of mega projects in Bengaluru.”“We have got a very big vision for Bengaluru, the greatest challenge is whether we will be capable of keeping up the timeline in implementing the projects. Therefore early planning, perfect planning, as well as perfect implementation of the plan is very important,” Bommai further said.Bengaluru’s administrators thrive on its monickers like IT and startup capital and others to appropriate ambitions of wanting it to be recognized as global city. But its poor infrastructure has been the cause for most of its problems with poor quality of roads, lack of basic civic amenities, mismanaged garbage, long-delays in completion of infrastructure projects, unplanned and rapid growth and several others that has brought down the overall quality of life in one of India’s most industrious urban centres.The IT/BT department of Karnataka had even sent out an advisory to technology and other corporations that have offices on outer ring road (ORR) to extend work from home policies to their employees till the end of December 2022 to help reduce imminent congestion due to the metro project on that road.Bommai had said that he will personally supervise projects like the metro, ORR, high speed train from international airport to the city and other infrastructure undertakings.“We will have special authority for health infrastructure in the city, and regarding traffic we have decided to work on 12 high-density roads for seamless traffic movement, also seamless signaling with artificial intelligence.” The government has plans for all-round development of the city that include core areas under the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), about 110 villages that were added to it, and also ‘showcasing’ the Central Business District (CBD).He also said that the city had potential to create 3-4 additional CBD’s in all directions of Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ktaka-cm-will-personally-take-stock-of-mega-projects-in-capital-101630262501166.html

Geetika, her brother Balram Jakhar (who is also a naib tehsildar posted at Bhattu in Fatehabad), and others came to our residence on the night of August 26 and assaulted the family members,” Singh added.He has written to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, deputy CM Dushyant Chautala, state home minister Anil Vij, the Haryana DGP and other senior cops but no action has been taken so far against Geetika and her brother.However, Balram Jakhar said he had gone to the ancestral house in Agroha for some domestic work and Prakash Veer’s family assaulted him. “Police have lodged an FIR against them after I lodged a complaint before them,” he added.And DSP Geetika said she had gone to resolve the issue of ownership of the ancestral house.Agroha police station SHO Priyansu Divan said both sides have lodged complaints against each other.“We have registered an FIR against Geetika’s uncle Prakash Veer, his wife Savita, son Dhrambir, Nisha and Preeti under Sections 506 (criminal intimidation), 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance with common intention), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 448 (punishment for house-trespass) and 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on complaint of Balram.On a complaint filed by Prakash Veer against Geetika and Balram, we have referred the complaint to the Fatehabad DC and SP under Section 197of the CrPC to initiate action.As per government norms, since the complaint has been filed against class-one officials, the FIR will be registered after due permission from higher authorities, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/arjuna-awardee-wrestler-dsp-geetika-jakhar-brother-accused-of-assaulting-uncle-s-family-101630262383468.html
30-08-2021||Mumbai||Stakeholders question University of Mumbai’s nod for 74 new colleges||University of Mumbai’s recent announcement of having approved 74 new colleges to its already large brood of affiliated colleges has attracted dissent and arguments from several stakeholders. While varsity officials have pointed that the plan for new colleges – for the 2022-23 academic year – have been approved after taking into consideration the demand, teacher representatives and several senate members have highlighted how this move has been made without following basic statutory laws as prescribed in the Maharashtra State Public University’s Act.“The university statues specifically mention that a special committee should conduct a survey of the location and understand from stakeholders the need for colleges before approving a new college in their perspective plan. However, no such physical survey was conducted. Approving colleges in a city that already is overflowing with colleges, especially for traditional arts, science and commerce, shows zero research by the varsity,” said Tapati Mukhopadhyay, president, Maharashtra Federation of University and College Teachers’ Organisation (MFUCTO).The perspective plan is an annual exercise to chart out MU’s future growth. It provides details about prospective colleges for different regions under the university’s jurisdiction. The plan needs the state government’s nod before it is finalised.Last year, MU had proposed 36 new colleges for academic year 2021-22 in its perspective plan. Later, the state government added 18 more to the list. Eventually, managements of only 24 colleges showed interest and applied, and got the final approval from the state government. This year, more than double the number of colleges has been proposed by the university, and, if approved, the total number of affiliated colleges under MU will cross 900.“Instead of focussing on giving autonomy to colleges, the university is busy adding to its burden by adding new institutes, especially in cities like Mumbai, where there’s already an overflow of colleges. Time and again, we have highlighted the problem of vacant teacher posts, which has left many colleges at the mercy of ad-hoc or visiting faculties. MU should focus on maintaining the existing infrastructure and save the dying colleges,” said a former senior official from the varsity on condition of anonymity. At present, only 42 MU colleges have been awarded the autonomous status while several others are still waiting for approval.The university controls over 840 affiliated colleges across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (NMR), including Thane and Palghar as well as Raigad, Sindhudurg, Daman and Goa. The large area and huge number of colleges, coupled with an acute shortage of staff, often creates administrative problems for the varsity, affecting the overall quality of education imparted.According to the new perspective plan, MU has recommended to start 46 new arts, science and commerce colleges, 15 law colleges, eight night colleges and three women’s colleges. While 12 locations have been identified in suburban Mumbai, five are in the city. Once the locations are finalised, applications will be invited from parties interested in setting up the college. Principals, however, feel adding new colleges with traditional courses will be of no help.“A basic demographic survey of the city and state will show the varsity exactly what areas need colleges. Similarly, a visit to the area will give them (university) an idea on what courses are in demand among the youth. Figures show that enrolment numbers for the university dipped in 2020-21 to 190,000 from 220,000 the year before. Yet the university only focusses on new colleges instead of maintaining the existing institutes,” said the principal of a city college. He added that instead of new traditional colleges, MU should focus on adding divisions for self-financed courses in the existing colleges to accommodate the growing demand.An official from MU, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The university is not an approving body for opening colleges. As per the guidelines of the state government, the university can only recommend new colleges for approval to the government, which we have done. The basis is to address the demand for courses in different areas and to ensure that not a single student is deprived of admission due to lack of availability of a college nearby.”However, the official said that opening a new college would address demand better than providing autonomy to more existing colleges. “When a new college is approved, it means that the institute has adequate infrastructure to handle footfall of students. To get autonomy, colleges must have a National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) accreditation of A and adequate infrastructure. This becomes difficult for colleges in the city that have limited space at their disposal. Also, opening new colleges will prevent the monopoly of certain colleges and give students options between more colleges,” said the official.Despite repeated attempts, university pro vice-chancellor Ravindra Kulkarni did not respond to calls or messages.For years, law colleges have been mushrooming all over the city, and with every passing year, while the number of colleges increases, students feel the infrastructure is not equipped to support the growing strength. “Most law colleges depend heavily on visiting faculty because the university doesn’t even approve vacant teaching posts. While the university only wants to show growing numbers on paper, the need of the hour is for the university to tackle existing problems first, and then opt for setting up of new institutes,” said Vaibhav Ekde, president, Maharashtra Students Welfare Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/stakeholders-question-university-of-mumbai-s-nod-for-74-new-colleges-101630262382416.html

Had the farmers crossed this checkpoint, it would have created a law and order situation, he said.“This is not the complete video. He had told the cops to ensure that farmers don’t cross the checkpost,” he added. The DC said there was minimum use of force to maintain law and order.However, the DC skipped questions related to the blockade on most city roads by the police for a meeting of the ruling political party.On the other hand, farmers of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha had demanded strict action against the SDM.The farmers’ front is demanding that the SDM be terminated from service.“The duty magistrate should be terminated for torture and lathi-charge on farmers.

30-08-2021||Other||New list of district heads fans discontent in Kerala Congress||The faction-ridden Congress unit in Kerala plunged into a crisis on Sunday after the release of the list of district Congress committee (DCC) presidents. Two senior leaders were suspended from the party for airing their grievances in public, HT has learnt.Party state president K Sudhakaran MP suspended former MLA K Sivadasan Nair and PCC general secretary K P Anil Kumar for criticising the reshuffle in channel discussion. Both leaders alleged the action was taken against them without a show-cause notice or explanation.Former CM Oommen and senior leader Ramesh Chennithala also came out against the new list and questioned action against two leaders.But Sudhakaran and opposition leader VD Satheesan said all leaders were consulted before naming the DCC chiefs and group equations were not applied this time. He said the list was a mix of the youth and the experienced leaders.“Both Chandy and Chennithala were consulted and some of their recommendations were included. It is not fair for both to criticise the list now. The party is supreme not factions,” said Sudhakaran in Delhi. He even showed a diary in which he noted down names recommended by Chandy to buttress his claim. He said it was sad to hear such a claim from a senior leader like Chandy. “Our only intention is to reinvigorate the party in the state. It is an attempt towards this,” he said.Chandy, however, reiterated his claim. “Proper consultations were not held. And disciplinary action against two leaders was not in good taste,” he said. Party MP Benny Behnan and former minister KC Joseph also criticised the list and action against leaders.The simmering dissension in the party with the elevation of the new party president and opposition leader came out in the open with the release of the DCC list.The party was in the grip of two senior leaders - Chandy and Chennithala - for a long time and they decided everything. The latest move is an attempt to come out of group equations and an opportunity to instil fresh blood but some of the selected, including Wayanad president ND Appachan, are old, critics point out. Struggling with Punjab and Chattisgarh infighting, the party high command has expressed serious concern over the latest revolt in the state unit.In Pathanamthitta, black flags were hoisted at the DCC office against the elevation of new DCC president Satheesh Kochuparambhil. Strong protests surfaced in Thiruvananthapuram and Malappuram also but the KPCC president said the ongoing protest was on small scale and will die down soon. But many political observers said the new list will trigger more fissures in the party. “Though it was stated a generational change, many veterans are back and the new list will create more fissures than solving any,” said political observer A Jayashankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-list-of-district-heads-fans-discontent-in-kerala-congress-101630261901572.html
30-08-2021||Delhi||‘Fake call centre’ scams spread web in Delhi-NCR||Back in 2016, when the world was talking about the massive ‘Thane call centre scam’ in which an organised gang of crooks posing as American Internal Revenue Service officials defrauded over 15,000 Americans of over ₹2,040 crore over two years, people in Delhi-NCR only started waking up to a new threat.At that time, similar scammers in the Capital and around it ran fake call centres to dupe gullible people by promising lucrative jobs or lottery sweepstakes. But when the true extent of the Thane scam became known, especially after the extradition from Dubai and later arrest of the 24-year-old mastermind, Sagar Thakkar alias Shaggy, by Mumbai Police, crooks here had a unique crime model to learn from.The stakes were high. Thakkar accumulated a lot of wealth in a very short time and others wanted to be like him, said senior Delhi and Gurugram police officers who have been involved in various crackdowns on fake call centres.But since then, such operations have become increasingly prevalent. Over the last seven to eight months, several fake call centres have been busted in Delhi-NCR and hundreds of scammers have been put behind bars for targeting gullible Americans and extorting money by posing as US law enforcement officials or as executives of private companies like Amazon and Microsoft.In Delhi alone, over 300 people have been arrested in the last two months for running at least 10 bogus BPOs in south, west, outer and eastern parts of the city — all swindling US citizens of millions of dollars.The modus operandiAs a first step, the scammers take on rent space in any residential or commercial neighbourhood. They then arrange for computers having fast internet connections and encrypted internet voice calling applications installed in them and some gadgets for internet calling that bypass international long-distance calling gateways. After that, a mix of experienced and untrained tele-callers fluent in English are hired and a database of Americans is procured through data thieves over the internet. That’s all that is needed to set up a fake call centre.“The kingpins of all these BPOs are mainly people who have earlier worked in call centres (usually the bogus ones) and earned expertise in how to run the illegal business of cheating and extorting unsuspecting foreigners,” said deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell, CyPAD) Anyesh Roy.Chandan Kumar, who was arrested by Gurugram Police for allegedly running some unauthorised call centres but is presently out on bail, said that one can start the illegal operation with just ₹2 lakh as an investment.“I took a small office on rent in an industrial area, arranged two laptops and two workstations and started making calls. After earning some money by conning three targets, I changed the office and hired six employees,” Kumar said.Nexus of realtors, crooks“We have learnt that many property dealers have also joined hands with these scammers. Their role is to provide an ideal property where police visits are least expected... The realtors get hefty commission money from the scammers, who rent these properties on double or triple the actual monthly rent,” said a police inspector whose team busted at least three such call centres between June and July.Staffers are then hired from social networking sites or placement agencies.“Fluency in speaking English with a foreign accent and having basic knowledge in using computers or laptops are the only criteria that they look for in the applicants. It is the reason that scammers mostly look for men and women from northeastern states for hiring them as tele-callers,” said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram.After obtaining lists of job-seekers interested in working in call centres from the placement agencies, the scammers invite them for job interviews held online and offline. During the interview, the applicants are tested for their English speaking fluency and computer knowledge.Sumit Sharma from Haryana’s Rohtak, who was arrested in 2019, said that setting up a call centre is still easy but training freshers and convincing them for participating in the scam is a tough task.“We pay huge amounts to voice and accent trainers to set up the operations. To operate illegal processes we need untrained people. Young staff take at least six months to understand the illegalities and by then we change the team to evade police action,” said Sharma.The training ranges from three days for experienced tele-callers and one week for freshers.The real dealAfter the training comes the most important chapter of the operation — calling up targets in countries like the United States.The scam typically begins with a pre-recorded threatening robocall claiming to be from the US law enforcement and telling the US citizen that his social security number (SSN) will be suspended soon because of some illegal money transactions or activities detected by the government. To avoid any legal action, the citizen is persuaded to connect with the department concerned by pressing 1 on the interactive voice response (IVR). As the victim presses 1, the call gets connected to one of the tele-callers sitting in India.“The tele-caller impersonates an official of the social security department, intimidates the person further, and tricks him/her into buying e-gift cards of various companies such as Target, Nike, Walmart, Gpay, Macy’s, Best Buy, etc. Thereafter, the person is asked to share the gift card’s number and its PIN as a security deposit and payment for not pursuing legal action. As the gift card’s details are obtained, the tele-caller disconnects the call. As the number used by the tele-caller is a spoofed VoIP number, the victim cannot call back,” said Gurugram’s assistant commissioner of police (cyber cell) Karan Goel.The gift card details are shared with the blockers who redeem them and send the payment in cash through hawala channels after deducting their commission amounts. On average, two to three US citizens are duped every day by each call centre, said many police officers who have been part of the operations against fake call centres in Delhi-NCR.“We bust call centres, arrest scammers and register cases mainly on suo-motu cognisance. As the victims are foreigners, it becomes difficult to bring them on board for filing their complaints or help us in our investigation. This makes our cases weak. The scammers are aware of these hurdles the police face and take advantage of the situation,” said a Delhi Police cyber cell officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fake-call-centre-scams-spread-web-in-delhincr-101630261841411.html

Police said all four were residents of Brijpuri in northeast Delhi.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said a caller informed the police control room (PCR) at around 7.30am that four children were drowning in the river near Sur Ghat at Wazirabad.A police team reached there and found that divers from the Boat Club had rescued one of the boys, Bunty (14).The bodies of three other boys -- identified as Somveer (16), Pankaj (15) and Sumit (15) -- were fished out from the river by the rescue team members and taken to a nearby hospital, where they were declared brought dead. A police officer said Bunty is Somveer’s brother.The officer said that all the four boys had left their homes around 5am for a morning walk in a nearby park, from where they went to Sur Ghat to swim in the Yamuna river. Since some construction related to the Delhi Metro was going on at their usual spot, the boys decided to take a dip at a spot further away.Harish Kumar, who is the in-charge of the Boat Club at Civil Lines that comes under the office of the district magistrate (east), said that he received information about the drowning around 7.45 am, following which a rescue team on a motor boat, which was patrolling the river nearby, rushed to the area.“Nine divers and a motor boat were involved in an hour-long rescue operation. While one boy was saved, the bodies of the other three were fished out from the river,” said Kumar.Police said that the family members of the deceased were informed and the bodies were sent to a nearby government hospital for autopsy. The families did not allege foul play or file any complaint.Pankaj is survived by his parents and three sisters while Sumit left behind his parents and two brothers, police said, adding that Somveer lived with his parents and two siblings, including Bunty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiout-for-a-swim-3-minors-drown-in-the-yamuna-1-rescued-101630261600618.html

30-08-2021||Delhi||Khari Baoli dry fruit market has centuries-old ties with Kabul||Surjeet Singh, a wholesale dry fruits trader, is watching the ongoing crisis in Afghanistan with great concern.“My business is completely dependent on Afghanistan; almost everything here is imported from there, ” says Singh, pointing to a range of dry fruits -- pistachio, walnuts, raisins, figs and almonds -- neatly displayed in small containers inside his shop in Katra Ishwar Bhawan, a maze of narrow, dimly lit pathways with hundreds of dry fruit wholesalers, in Khari Baoli in old Delhi. “No market in the country has deeper and older ties with Afghanistan than this market.”Afghanistan has been driving the dry fruit business in Khari Baoli, which is India’s biggest dry fruit market and home to some of the oldest dry fruit importers in the country. India’s imports from Afghanistan were pegged at about ₹3,700 crore in 2020-21, with fruits and nuts accounting for more than ₹2,300 crore, according to the Union ministry of commerce’s trade database. Some estimates suggest that up to 85% of India’s dry fruits come from Afghanistan, and the hundreds of traders and importers in Khari Baoli, like Singh, import the bulk of it.Since the Mughal period, Khari Baoli in Chandni Chowk has been a key commercial centre, attracting dry fruit traders and merchants from all corners of the country and abroad. The Pathan traders, who travelled in caravans, carrying carpets and dry fruit, formed trade networks in the 18th century that spanned from Afghanistan to Delhi and beyond. “They sold their goods in Chandni Chowk at the open adat shops (commission shops) of local traders,” says Lalit Kumar Gupta, former general secretary, Kirana Committee Delhi, an association of dry fruit and spice traders in Khari Baoli. An engraved stone on the wall of its first-floor office in the crowded market says it was formed in 1906, which makes it the oldest traders association in Chandni Chowk. The Pathans, who have historically been engaged in the dry fruit business in Afghanistan, continues to rule the dry fruit trade with India.After Partition, many big dry fruit traders in Peshawar and Quetta — the other two major centres of the dry fruit business in undivided India — who had been doing business with traders in Afghanistan, shifted to Khari Baoli, deepening and widening the walled city market’s business ties with Afghanistan.In 1952, these traders from Peshawar formed the Indo-Afghan Chambers of Commerce, which today has over 250 members, including some of the oldest and biggest dry fruit importers in the market. “The idea behind it was to promote business between the two countries. When it was formed, it had traders from both India and Afghanistan, ” says Kanwarjit Bajaj , 79, president, Indo- Afghan Chambers of Commerce and owner of Tulsi Nuts and Dry Fruits brand, one of India’s biggest dry fruit importers and exporters.A first-of-its-kind business body aimed at furthering trade ties between the two countries, the Indo- Afghan Chambers of Commerce was registered in Katra Ishwar Bhawan, in Khari Baoli, where it continues to have its office.“Many dry fruit traders here had their office in Kabul. Like most others we shut our office in the early 1990s because of the worsening security situation in that country,” says SM Wadhwa, who runs Hind International Company, another major dry fruit importer in the market.The dry fruit trade with Afghanistan was disrupted during the previous Taliban regime between 1996 to 2001. In 2003, India and Afghanistan signed a Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) under which India allowed substantial duty concessions, ranging from 50% to 100%, to certain categories of Afghan dry fruits. Trade picked up again in 2005 and has since been growing steadily.Many Khari Baoli traders again began to travel to Afghanistan, and about 10 years ago, more and more Afghan traders began coming to Khari Baoli, with some even renting houses in nearby areas for a long stay. “They started coming because many of them felt they were not getting a good deal here in terms of prices, and receiving timely payments,” says a local trader, who does not wish to be named.“Many Afghan traders want to set up their own shops and offices, but as of now, they bring the dry fruit samples and fix the price, following which local traders import their dry fruit. The Afghan traders stay in the market till the consignment is sold and they receive the payment,” says Kapil Gulati, who runs a firm called Kandhar Trading.It is afternoon and he is busy taking stock of a consignment of figs that has just arrived from Afghanistan. All the shops in the street as elsewhere in the market are lit by LED lights as the market’s congested streets hardly receive any sunlight.“This is peak season, the time when we receive the fresh crop of dry fruits from Afghanistan. After the current crisis in the country, the biggest problem is the collapse of banking services due to which we can’t do the financial transactions with traders there. Also we are unable to carry out the necessary paperwork as many officials in the Afghan government are still not working,” says Gulati. “Some traders from Afghanistan, who were in the market for business, have got stuck in Delhi after the Taliban took over the country.”Gulati says his father named the firm Kandhar Trading, a tribute to Afghanistan’s Kandahar, because of his close business ties in the city.In fact, Gulati’s is not the only firm named after Afghanistan or an Afghan city, there are several others with names like Afghan Store, Kabul di Hatti, among others. “We named it Kabul di Hatti as my family has roots in that city, ” says Pawandeep Singh, who runs a dry fruit retail shop Khari Baoli.Interestingly, many local traders in the market, having worked with Afghan traders for decades, can speak Pashto.Most local traders say one of the reasons why the crisis in Afghanistan has not had an impact on business, except for a slight rise of prices on some dry fruits, so far is that now, a lot of dry fruits is coming from countries such as the US, Chile and Peru, among others. Today, Indian dry fruits imports from Afghanistan include Mamra and Gurbandi almonds, black raisins, apricots, pistachio, and piquant spices such as asafoetida.“The US has overtaken Afghanistan as far as almonds are concerned, but for everything else, the market is still dependent on Afghanistan. No country can match the wide dry fruit variety it offers. So Afghanistan continues to be as important to our market as ever,” says Wadhwa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/khari-baoli-dry-fruit-market-has-centuries-old-ties-with-kabul-101630261181356.html
30-08-2021||Mumbai||18 children from Mankhurd Children’s Home test positive for Covid-19||Eighteen children from Mankhurd Children’s Home have tested positive for Covid-19 in the past three days between August 25 and 27. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has confirmed the development. A total of 102 children were tested for Covid-19 after one of the children, who came in contact with one of the infected staff members, tested positive on August 25.Mankhurd Children’s Home, which houses orphans, is run by the state government. A BMC official said, “We cannot conclude any source, but it is assumed that one of the staff members who came in contact with one of the children passed on the infection. We later tested more children to ensure timely treatment.”After the first case was reported on August 25, two more children were tested and were found to be positive. After this, another 15 samples came out to be positive.BMC officials said all children are admitted at Videocon Atithi Covid-19 centre and are said to be stable. Of the Covid positive children, one is aged nine, four are between the age of 12 and 13, five are in the age group of 14 to 15 years and six are in the age group of 16 to 17 years. Age-wise data was available of only 16 patients.“We will conduct more tests in the coming days, if required,” said a ward official.The incident comes two days after 26 persons, including children and staff members, tested positive for Covid at St Joseph Orphanage in Agripada area of south Mumbai. BMC has plans to conduct a second fever camp at St Joseph orphanage this week. Meanwhile, there are predictions that more children are likely to be infected in the anticipated third wave. In view of this, BMC had in June conducted a sero survey among the 1-18 years age group to gauge the prevalence of the virus among the young population. The overall seropositivity rate was found to be 51.18%. The sero survey was conducted in association with BYL Nair Hospital and civic-run Kasturba Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/18-children-from-mankhurd-children-s-home-test-positive-for-covid19-101630260761244.html

The BJP said the charge was a ploy to “mislead” people.“After pushing the MCDs to bankruptcy, the BJP-led north MCD now plans to sell 10 hospitals and medical colleges. The BJP is preparing to sell all of MCD’s assets at throwaway prices...,” said AAP’s spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj during a press conference at the party office in Delhi.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said: “The political leadership of North MCD has no intent to handover municipal health services to the Centre or Delhi government... The standing committee agenda referred to by Bhardwaj has been prepared by the bureaucratic wing of North MCD on the commissioner’s direction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-alleges-bjp-trying-to-sell-civic-hospitals-in-delhi-101630260100454.html
30-08-2021||Delhi||Transport of food grains in Delhi now an essential service||The Delhi government has notified the movement of food grains for the public distribution system (PDS) – largely transport of wheat and rice from other states to the Capital and from godowns to fair price shops within the city – as an essential service till at least February next year.The move, said senior government officials, is aimed at reducing delays in delivery of monthly rations caused by lockdowns, curfews, strikes and other potential interruptions.“The government of NCT of Delhi, in order to ensure maintenance of the essential and uninterrupted services, declared movement of the food grains up to Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns in Delhi, loading unloading of the food grains at the godowns,... further transportation of food grains from these godowns to fair price shops/designated locations, their loading/unloading of the food grains at these locations, as essential services for a period of six months…,” said the order issued by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal’s office on August 19, a copy of which HT has seen.Two senior officials in the Delhi government’s home and civil supplies departments said the notification will help resolve frequent delays in ration distribution even if there are lockdowns due to a potential third wave of the pandemic.Ration distribution in the city usually starts in the first week of every month but since April this year, when several states imposed local lockdowns in the light of severe surges in Covid cases, Delhi has faced severe delays every month. According to documents seen by HT, ration for April and May were disbursed together at the end of May; in June, ration distribution started on the 21st; July saw a delay of 20 days; and in August, it started on the 25th.During the first nationwide lockdown imposed in March 2020, the central government issued directions to all states, asking them to keep movement of food grains meant for ration distribution as an essential service till the time the restrictions were in place.“But when the second wave of the pandemic hit India in March 2021, states went for individual lockdowns and several of them, including Delhi, did not separately notify movement of food grains that is meant for ration distribution as an essential service, thinking it won’t be a problem as ration shops and offices engaged in the public distribution system were already notified as essential services,” said an official in the Delhi home department who did not wish to be identified.An official in the civil supplies department, who too did not wish to be identified, said, “Transport of food grains faced issues in some state or the other, eventually affecting supply and distribution in Delhi. Fuel price strikes by transporters in the subsequent months made the situation worse. Now that it is covered under essential services, any obstruction to transport of food grains will be a punishable offence with a jail term up to six months.”Many beneficiaries welcomed the intervention. “Delays in ration distribution in the last few months has been a major problem. If the government is working on it, it is a big relief,” said Rakesh Kumar, a factory worker who lives with his family in the slums along the rail tracks in west Delhi’s Mayapuri industrial area.Shailendra Kumar, president of Delhi Public Distribution System Welfare Association, said, “This initiative will help ensure ration supplies are not delayed under any circumstances... To further ease the system, the government should consider entrusting individual fair price shop owners to take charge of transport of food grains between godowns and shops.”Naveen Kumar Gupta, secretary general of All India Motor Transport Congress, too supported the move. “But the new rule should not be used to force transporters into ferrying goods by incurring losses. The government should immediately implement policies to waive off loans of transporters, reduce certain taxes and check corruption. Also, truckers should be categorised as frontline workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/transport-of-food-grains-in-delhi-now-an-essential-service-101630259927860.html

He was speaking during an interaction with Afghan students in Pune on Sunday. He also assured the students that the state government would write to the Centre regarding students who’s visas are expiring.Maharashtra has the second largest number of students from Afghanistan, after New Delhi. “We will hold a state-level meeting about the problems faced by Afghan students. We will also reach out to the central government regarding the visa expiry of a few students. We will address the fee issues and visa issues. We will need the next seven or eight days to devise a formula to help Afghan students in Maharashtra and Pune,” said Samant.Wali Rahman Rahmani, president of the Afghan students association, said that the situation in Afghanistan is known to everyone. “Students are facing larger problems physically, psychologically and financially. We need the Indian government to support us the most. There are students who are in need of extending their scholarships for the next year. Many families are not able to extend financial help. There are self-financed students who are in dire need of financial help,” said Rahmani.Many students whose visas are about to expire need immediate assistance from the Indian government, Rahmani added.Rasheeda Shahbadi, studying for her Master’s in Arts (MA) in Politics, said that she now wants to pursue her PhD.“I need a visa extension for the same. Many Afghan students need help financially and emotionally,” she said. Samant said that the government of Maharashtra stands with the Afghan students. He urged private universities to help students from Afghanistan in every way possible.Speaking about the Common Entrance Test (CET), Samant said that dates for the same will be released soon.“I had released tentative dates for the CET, but those were tentative. The new dates will be released in the next few days,” added Samant.He added that there are rising cases of Covid in some areas. “In such a scenario, reopening of colleges is not safe for students and hence, the decision is on hold,” said Samant.He also added that everyone should follow Covid norms to avoid the onset of the third wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-committee-will-be-formed-to-help-afghan-students-uday-samant-101630256320344.html

This will be decided by a PMC auditor once the survey is completed,” said Chetna Kerure, joint managing director, PMPML.Once a bus stop is built it is the responsibility of civic bodies and respective cantonment boards to maintain it.There are mainly four types of PMPML shelters. One type of structure, called the “Pune pattern” has a life span of seven years; a stainless steel bus stop has a life span of 12 years and then there is the BRT complaint, “smart” bus-stop.Across the city there are still many “Pune pattern” bus stops which have become unsafe as their structure is damaged, as per commuters.“There are few old bus stops at Swargate which don’t have a proper base to sit as it has been damaged. The condition has been the same for many days and no action has been taken,” said Kinjal Shah, a regular commuter.One of the PMPML officials requesting anonymity said, “PMPML is already facing a cash crunch so it cannot handle the complete budget of bringing in new structures. Once the survey is done, the PMC auditor will finalise the further procedure.”Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) under whose limit 20 bus stops exist will also be audited. However, work has not started yet.“We have written to the contractor regarding the audit work, however, there is a dispute between the contractor and PCB as the contractor wants to discontinue the work. According to a clause, the current contractor cannot be relieved until the new contractor is finalised. We are yet to get a response from the contractor, if we do not receive it in a few days then we will take different action on the whole issue,” said Amit Kumar, chief executive officer (CEO) of PCB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmpml-surveying-1-500-bus-stops-to-establish-if-structures-are-safe-101630255780291.html

30-08-2021||Lucknow||Ramayan relevant for all, offers code of conduct: President||Stating that Ayodhya is not Ayodhya without Lord Ram, President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday said, “Ayodhya exists where there is Ram. Lord Ram resides permanently in this city and, therefore, in the true sense this place is Ayodhya.”Inaugurating a four-day Ramayan conclave in Ayodhya, he also lauded the Uttar Pradesh government for its efforts to take the Ramayan to the common people through art and culture. Sharing his views on Ayodhya, the relevance and importance of Ramayan on the occasion, he asserted that the teachings of the Ramayan were relevant for all.Addressing the gathering, the President explained the meaning of the word Ayodhya and said: “The literal meaning of Ayodhya is the one who is impossible to wage a war against.”“Due to Raghuvanshi rulers like Raghu, Dileep, Aja, Dashrath and Ram, their capital could never be conquered. Therefore, the name of this city Ayodhya will always be relevant,” the President said. Explaining the importance of the Ramayan, the President also said: “The Ramayan will always be relevant as it offers inherent values of life that are relevant for humanity. Ramayan also offers a model code of conduct that guides us in all aspects of life.” Explaining other aspects of the Ramayan as well, the President said: “Ramayan also tells us what the behaviour of a child with his parents should be, brother with brother, husband with wife, teacher with his disciple, friend with a friend, ruler with the public and human being with nature. On all dimensions, code of conduct is available in the Ramayan.”Referring to the word Ram in his name, the President said: “I feel that when my family members named me (Ram Nath Kovind), they were possibly having the feeling of respect and affection towards Ram Katha and Lord Ram, which is seen in the common public.” Quoting a popular verse of the Ramcharitmanas, the President said: “The meaning of this line is that knowing the whole world as God, we should accept everyone with respect.”“Let us all see Goddess Sita and Lord Ram in every person. Lord Ram is for everyone, and Lord Ram is in everyone. Let us all fulfil our obligations with warm thought,” said the President. Lauding the Uttar Pradesh government, he said, “I applaud chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his team for the campaign to take the Ramayan to the common people through art and culture by organising the Ramayan Conclave.”“To prove the significance of the Ramayan Conclave, it is necessary that the basic ideals of Ram Katha should be propagated everywhere, and everyone should adopt those ideals. I wish that just like all people in Ram Rajya were free from physical, divine and material sufferings, similarly all our countrymen would lead a happy life,” Kovind said.On the occasion, the President also recalled Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals. The President said: “Gandhiji has given the name Ram Rajya for an ideal India. Mahatma Gandhi imbibed the ideals of Lord Ram in public life. In fact, the ‘Maryada-Purshottam’ form of Lord Ram described in the Ramayan is ideal for everyone.” Sharing his views on the Ramayan, the President said: “The Ramayan is such a unique book which presents high ideals and limits of human life in front of the world through Ram Katha.” “I am sure that this effort of the Uttar Pradesh government for promotion of the Ramayan will prove to be important in the interest of Indian culture and the entire humanity,” he said.The President is on a four-day visit to Uttar Pradesh from August 26. He arrived in Ayodhya onboard the special presidential train on Sunday morning. He was received by governor Anandiben Patel and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on arrival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/president-lauds-up-govt-for-taking-ramayan-to-common-people-through-art-and-culture-101630251221128.html

30-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC to issue ex-parte order in defamation case||The Delhi high court on Friday said it will pronounce ex-parte (n the application of one party alone) interim order on state transport minister Kailash Gahlot’s civil defamation plea against BJP MLA Vijender Gupta for the latter’s social media posts, alleging irregularities in procurement of 1,000 low-floor buses by the Delhi Transport Corporation.“None appear for the defendants. We will pass order in this,” said Justice Asha Menon after hearing the arguments by Gahlot’s counsel. In his petition, Gahlot has sought ₹5 crore as damages from the BJP MLA for allegedly making scandalous statements relating to irregularities in buses deal.Senior counsel Rajiv Nayar, who represented Gahlot, said Gupta, a political rival, has posted “unabated tweets” doubting the integrity of the minister in relation to the purchase of the low-floor buses, despite a clean-chit by a high-powered committee.“Delhi government floated a tender for buses. After due process, it was awarded to Tata (but) all sorts of allegations were made. A high-powered committee gave a report that everything was in order,” Nayar submitted.“Despite the report, we have unabated tweets (calling) me to be a person of doubtful integrity,” he said on behalf of Gahlot.The court was informed that although the issue was discussed in the Delhi assembly, and Gahlot replied to the debate in the House, Gupta continued to make wrong statements.“You are a responsible MLA. (it was) raised on the floor of the House and I answered it. I beseech my lady to pass an interim order of protection,” said the senior counsel.In his civil defamation suit, Gahlot has also sought removal of the alleged defamatory content from social media.The Union government has recommended a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the purchase of 1,000 air-conditioned low-floor buses by the Delhi government, and a maintenance contract for them. On August 16, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) informed Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Kumar Dev about the CBI probe. The ministry’s note, said the MHA, after examining the report submitted by a three-member panel appointed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, has asked CBI to look into the matter.On August 20, Gupta tweeted about the CBI inquiry. “CBI investigation started in DTC bus purchase scam.

30-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi minister Gahlot filed defamation suits against BJP MLA Vijender Gupta||State transport minister Kailash Gahlot on Thursday filed civil and criminal defamation suits in the Delhi high court against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Vijender Gupta, seeking ₹5 crore in damages and sought removal of media posts by the BJP legislator regarding alleged irregularities in procurement of public buses.Gupta dismissed the allegations as baseless and hit back at Gahlot, saying that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government is trying to mislead people.The Union government has recommended a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the purchase of 1,000 air-conditioned low-floor buses by the Delhi government, and a maintenance contract for them, both of which have been a sticking point between the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government and the state unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).On August 16, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) informed Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Kumar Dev about the CBI probe. The ministry’s note, a copy of which HT has seen, said the ministry of home affairs (MHA), after examining the report submitted by a three-member panel appointed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal has asked CBI to look into the matter.On August 20, Gupta tweeted about the CBI inquiry. “CBI investigation started in DTC bus purchase scam. Dismiss transport minister Kailash Gahlot and arrest him. The Kejriwal government has tried its best to suppress the corruption of ₹5000 crore. Why did the Aam Aadmi Party leaders remain silent in the bus purchase scam?”, he tweeted. He posted the same on his Facebook account.Over the next three days, his social media timeline shows, he posted similar allegations naming CM Arvind Kejriwal and deputy CM Manish Sisodia.A statement by Gahlot’s office on Thursday said: “Transport minister Kailash Gahlot files criminal, civil defamation suits against BJP MLA Vijender Gupta for making scandalous allegations in the purchase of low-floor buses. Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot seeks Rs. 5 crore as damages in the civil defamation suit from BJP MLA Vijender Gupta for making reckless and malafide remarks against him. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot seeks action under sections 499, 501 against Vijender Gupta in the criminal defamation suit after he made scandalous allegations to gain political mileage.”It further said, “Transport minister Kailash Gahlot pleas for an injunction order against Vijender Gupta seeking removal of defamatory content posted by him on Twitter & Facebook. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot moves to the high court to get Facebook, Twitter to remove scandalous content posted by Vijender Gupta against him.”Dismissing the allegations as “baseless”, Gupta said he was talking about the findings of a panel appointed by the LG on the bus purchase controversy. “It is clear that Gahlot and the Aam Aadmi Party government is not being able to handle the pressure after their scam got exposed. The LG set up a fact-finding committee on the matter and I have only posted about findings of the committee. There is nothing slanderous or malicious in it. Let the investigation take place. The Delhi government is just trying to mislead people and trying to divert attention by filing such frivolous cases.”HT reported on July 11 that the LG-appointed panel gave a clean chit to the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) in the tendering and procurement of the buses, although it found some “procedural lapses” arising out of “a bona fide decision making”.“The tendering process of purchase of buses warrants no interference and suffers from no major infirmity...

30-08-2021||World||Rockets fired at American forces on eve of Afghanistan exit||Anti-missile defences intercepted rockets fired at Kabul’s airport on Monday, as the US’s 20-year war in Afghanistan entered its final hours, with the last Americans seeking to be evacuated and the US military preparing to end its airlift and depart the Taliban-controlled capital.Two US officials said the “core” diplomatic staff withdrew by Monday morning. They did not say whether this included top envoy Ross Wilson, expected to be among the last to leave before the final troops themselves.A US official said initial reports did not indicate any American casualties from as many as five missiles fired on the airport. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks. The rockets followed a massive suicide bombing outside the teeming airport gates on Thursday, which killed scores of Afghans and 13 US troops.Of the five rockets fired at the airport on Monday, three missed the target, one was shot down by US defence systems, and a fifth landed on the airport compound causing little damage and no injuries.Also Read | Islamic State group claims latest Kabul attack: ReportThe US also said it was investigating widespread reports that a number of civilians, possibly nine members of the same family including several children, were killed as it carried out a drone strike on Sunday to target a suicide bomber planning to strike the airport.“We are aware, reports of civilian casualties and we take these reports very seriously, and we are continuing to assess the situation,” Major General Hank Taylor said at the Pentagon’s briefing amid criticism over the civilian casualties.The threat of more attacks against Kabul airport remained acute, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said.Kirby said the evacuation operation at the airport, currently controlled by thousands of US troops, is on high alert after the Islamic State-Khorasan launched five rockets.“We’re in a particularly dangerous time right now,” Kirby told reporters. “The threat stream is still real, it’s still active, and in many cases it’s still specific.”US troops, whose numbers grew to 5,800 after the evacuation operation began on August 14, were already departing ahead of the August 31 deadline set by President Joe Biden to fully exit the country, now in the hands of the Taliban that US forces fought for two decades.Taylor said more than 122,000 people have been evacuated from Kabul since July, including 5,400 Americans. He said it will continue to be possible to evacuate US citizens still in Afghanistan to the last moment.“The mission of the evacuation operation was to help as many people as possible leave Afghanistan,” he said.Tuesday’s deadline for all troops to leave was ordered by Biden, fulfilling an agreement reached with the Taliban by his predecessor Donald Trump to end Washington’s longest war.The Taliban will take full control of Kabul airport after the American withdrawal on Tuesday, Qatar’s Al Jazeera television network cited an unidentified Taliban member as saying.“This is the most dangerous time in an already extraordinarily dangerous mission these last couple of days,” said America’s top diplomat, secretary of state Antony Blinken.The White House said that about 1,200 people were evacuated from Kabul over the prior 24 hours aboard 26 US military flights and two allied flights.In a statement, the US Central Command said it was looking into the reports of civilian casualties that may have been caused by secondary explosions in the drone strike. An Afghan official said three children were killed in the strike.It was the second airstrike in recent days the US has conducted against the militant group. The Pentagon said a US drone mission in eastern Afghanistan killed two members of IS’ Afghanistan affiliate early Saturday local time in retaliation for the airport bombing.The White House has rescheduled Biden’s meeting with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, from Monday to Wednesday as the US pullout from Afghanistan enters its tense final hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rockets-fired-at-american-forces-on-eve-of-af-exit-101630346277814.html

Check list here||The countries constituting the European Union (EU) voted to remove the United States from the Covid-19 safe travel list, and reimpose fresh restrictions on non-essential travel, amid the country witnessing an upward swing in the infection rates, news agencies reported on Monday.According to a statement, a majority of ambassadors voted to reintroduce the curbs that were lifted in June this year. Apart from the US, five other nations that include Israel, Kosovo, Lebanon, Montenegro, and North Macedonia were also removed from the EU’s safe-travel list.The statement issued by the EU, however, stated that the guidance is a recommendation by the bloc and any decision on who to enter the countries that are part of the union, and what curbs to impose, ultimately remains for the respective governments to make. Furthermore, countries can also choose to accept proof of Covid-19 vaccination to waive travel curbs, the statement noted.Also Read | Fueled by Delta, Covid cases are on the rise in US; Florida hit worstThe decision comes even as airlines and travel firms have been insisting for a complete reopening of transatlantic routes. Also, shares of Air France-KLM, IAG SA and Deutsche Lufthansa AG came under pressure after the news of the bloc vote emerged.According to the New York Times, the single-day average hospitalised Covid-19 patients in the US is more than 100,000 over the last week. The growing number of patients is straining hospitals and healthcare workers even as deaths have seen a hike of over 1,000 per day on average – for the first time since March this year.Moreover, hospitalisations across the country have increased by nearly 500 per cent in the previous two months, with Florida currently having as many as 16,457 hospitalisations, followed by Texas, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services, the New York Times report added.Since the emergence of the virus, the US has confirmed 38,524,389 Covid-19 cases and 631, 134 fatalities so far, as per the global bulletin maintained by the World Health Organisation (WHO).(With inputs from Bloomberg)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-removes-us-and-5-other-nations-from-covid-safe-travel-list-check-list-here-101630344139941.html
30-08-2021||World||US knew of Pak N-plan but did not act: Declassified documents||The US state department knew Pakistan’s uranium enrichment programme using gas centrifuge technology way back in January 1979, along with a nascent enrichment facility in Kahuta, according to newly declassified and available American government documents.The documents posted on Tuesday by the National Security Archive, a non-government organisation that seeks to challenge government secrecy, published state department telegrams and internal memorandums from the time. Though alarmed by the discovery of Pakistan’s emerging nuclear capabilities, the Jimmy Carter administration refused to confront Islamabad for fear of alienating it at a time of challenging developments in the region - the Iranian revolution and growing Soviet Union influence in Afghanistan.The Carter administration also did not want to push Pakistan too hard because it saw it as a counterweight to Soviet-partner India, the documents show. “Pakistan is moving rapidly and secretly towards the construction of facilities which will give it nuclear explosive capability perhaps within two to four years,” wrote Harold Saunders, the then assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs, and Thomas Pickering, then assistant secretary for oceans, international environmental, and scientific affairs, to then secretary of state Cyrus Vance in January 1979.Pakistan would test its nuclear weapons, thus made its programme public, almost 20 years later in 1998, in response to Pokhran II tests by India, which, incidentally, had first revealed its nuclear capabilities in 1974 with Operation Smiling Buddha.Saunders and Pickering had gone on to lay down policy options for the United State to response, among them was aid-cut, which was not recommended as it could “complicate” matter, and direct contact with the Pakistanis, including an invitation to President Zia ul-Haq when the “dust has settled on the Bhutto case”. Former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who had been overthrown by Zia in 1977, was on death row then, and hanged in April 1979.President Carter, who came to office as a strong opponent of proliferation, faced an “acute dilemma” over Pakistan because, the National Security Archive said citing another January 1979 State telegram, “we (the US under Carter) wish to be more supportive” of Islamabad in the wake of a revolution in Iran and growing Soviet influence in Afghanistan.The then administration also “worried that pushing too hard on proliferation concerns could alienate Pakistan - a regional counterweight to Soviet partner India - and produce greater instability in the region”.“Ultimately, the archive added, “Carter held back from confronting Islamabad over its nuclear programme.”The Saunders-Pickering memo had been based on two findings, the National Security Archive said: One, Pakistan was found ‘building a facility capable of small-scale reprocessing, near the PINSTECH (Pakistan Institute for Science and Technology) research centre that would be capable of producing enough plutonium for at least one nuclear device annually. This was a reference to the ‘New Labs’ project, among other activities.The second was that a “secret gas centrifuge programme is intended to yield significant quantities of HEU (highly enriched uranium)”. The Pakistanis had already “succeeded in operating small number of centrifuge units”.Moreover, the archive said, referring to Kahuta, but not naming it, the Pakistanis “have plans for 7,000 units, and have begun to construct buildings to house the facility and to acquire equipment for the plant.” It would take about 2 years of work for the plant to operate and another two years before it could produce HEU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-knew-of-pak-n-plan-but-did-not-act-declassified-documents-101630344585153.html

He said the crisis once again underscored the fragility of ceasefire and urgent need for addressing the underlying causes that had triggered the escalation.Addressing the meeting in his national capacity, Shringla called on all parties to the conflict to refrain from acts that could exacerbate tensions and worsen the security situation in the region.“We recognise the efforts made by the UN and regional countries to prevent the hostilities from escalating into another military conflict,” Shringla said at the meeting, titled ‘Middle East Peace Process, including the Palestine Question’.Also read | 'T word is gone': UNSC does not mention Taliban in its terror statement“I reaffirm India’s call for regular and predictable transfer of aid and other essential items to Gaza to ease the humanitarian situation and facilitate early reconstruction, as well as for appropriate use of such aid,” the foreign secretary said.Shringla also stressed on "high-level interaction" between Israel and Palestine that contributed to a better environment for the resumption of direct peace negotiations."We hope to see early commencement of these negotiations between the two sides, as they provide the best opportunity to resolve all final status issues and achieve a two-state solution. The international community, the Middle East Quartet in particular, has an important role to play in reviving these negotiations," he said.Also read | Can’t be complacent about terror groups in Afghanistan, says India at UNSC meet“It is also important that the international donor community supports the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip through the Palestinian authority,” he said."The West Bank continues to witness incidents of violence and clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli security forces. Both sides must desist from provocative actions in the interest of peace and stability,” Shringla said."We note the progress in the legal challenge to the eviction of Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah and underscore the need for respecting the historic status quo in East Jerusalem and its neighbourhoods. We also urge parties to refrain from unilateral actions that undermine the viability of the two-State solution," he added.He underlined that "given our long-standing and firm commitment to the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable State of Palestine, within secure, recognised and mutually agreed borders, living side by side with Israel in peace and security, India will remain fully supportive of all efforts to restart the peace process."His remarks comes a day after Israel's Defence Minister Benny Gantz held talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank on Sunday, the first high-level meeting between the two sides in years.In his speech, Shringla noted that the decision by Israel to increase the number of work permits issued to Palestinians will help strengthen both the Palestinian and Israeli economies."Further, the recognition of COVID-vaccination certificates issued by the Palestinian Authority and the facilitation of passage of patients from the Gaza Strip to the West Bank are also positive signals," he said.Speaking about India’s contribution, Shringla said the country had helped in building schools, setting up ICT and vocational training centres, a technology park and a national printing press; and is also supporting several other quick-impact community projects in Palestine.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-unsc-meet-shringla-talks-of-ceasefire-fragility-escalation-in-gaza-strip-101630342480929.html
30-08-2021||World||Trump admin lost H-1B visa fight in its dying days||The Trump administration lost its fight against H-1B visas - used by US companies to hire foreign workers for high skilled jobs, most of them from India - in its dying days.It was beaten by US courts.In the last two quarters of financial year 2021 - from October 2020 to March 2021, most of which was Trump administration - the denial rates of new H-1B visas went down to 7.1% from 28% over a comparable period in 2020, says new research from the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), a non-partisan think-tank, based on data published by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).New or “initial” H-1Bs are fresh employment cases that count against the congressionally-mandated annual cap of 85,000, and not renewal of existing employment (H-1B is granted first for three years and then for a maximum of another three years).“The credit goes to the business associations, companies, universities and attorneys who fought the Trump administration’s H-1B policies, as well as the judges who were willing to listen to the arguments for why the policies were unlawful,” said Stuart Anderson, NFAP executive director.The denial rates of FY 2020 were not an exception but a trend emerged under President Donald Trump, who despite being a user of H-1B visa as a businessman, sided with immigration hawks of his administration to crack down on the work programme.The denial rate was 24% in FY 2018, 21% in FY 2019 and 13% in FY 2020, compared to 6% in FY 2015 and the report suggested that the FY 2020 denial rate would have been much higher but for the court rulings that kept the denial rate low in the fourth quarter.“The Trump administration managed to carry out what judges determined to be unlawful policies for nearly four years, illustrating the limitations of relying on the court system to prevent restrictive immigration policies,” the report said.The denial rate for “continuing” H-1B petitions - essentially renewal for existing employees - was 3% in the first two quarters of FY 2021, compared to 7% in FY 2020 and as high as 12% in FY 2018 and FY 2019. NFAP research showed the USCIS turned down only 3% of H-1B petitions for continuing employment in FY 2015, 5% in FY 2017.The trump administration sought to make its H-1B policies that had been tried through executive orders lawful through an “interim final rule” in October 2020. The rule was, however, struck down by a court for violating the Administrative Procedure Act, the NFAP report said, adding that companies and universities said the regulation would have made it nearly impossible to employ H-1B visa holders.H-1B policy changes brought by the Trump administration have been costly for employers. An NFAP analysis estimates that a policy change announced by the USCIS in 2015 may have cost employers approximately $600 million a year, or more than $3 billion, in legal costs since 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-admin-lost-h-1b-visa-fight-in-dying-days-101630342785973.html

The new rule states that minors in China will be allowed to play games on their phone for only three hours a week starting September 1.The National Press and Public Administration said that children can play games between 8pm and 9pm on Fridays and weekends and on public holidays. The new rule decreases the gaming time for children to three hours on maximum weeks of the year. Earlier, the Chinese government allowed minors to spend 90 minutes per day and three hours per week on mobile gaming.The Chinese government also said that it would increase the frequency of inspections of online game companies to make sure that these technology sector giants adhere to the regulations.China’s tech companies affected by new ruleGaming giant Tencent as well as NetEase were affected by the new regulations. Tencent, known for its Honor of Kings online multiplayer game globally, saw its stock price close down 0.6% at 465.80 Hong Kong dollars on Monday ahead of the regulator’s announcement.Tencent’s market capitalization of $573 billion is down more than $300 billion from its February peak, according to a report by news agency Associated Press. The decline is equal to more than the total value of Nike Inc and Pfizer Inc.The Chinese government is imposing these restrictions on gaming in a bid to control technology companies who they believe ‘may have an outsized influence on society’. Tencent earlier said it would limit gaming time for children to 60 minutes to an hour per day and to two hours during holidays. The company also banned children under the age of 12 from making in-game purchases.(with inputs from Associated Press)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-limits-mobile-gaming-time-to-three-hours-for-minors-report-101630341733078.html
30-08-2021||World||Pakistan NSA walks back remarks on Taliban, 9/11 attacks||Days after Pakistan’s National Security Adviser Moeed Yousuf was cited by the British media as a warning that a failure to engage with the Taliban would lead to the same mistakes that resulted in the 9/11 attacks, his office has described the connotation as fabricated. “Mark my words...If the mistakes of the nineties are made again and Afghanistan is abandoned, the outcome will be absolutely the same – a security vacuum filled by undesirable elements who will threaten everyone, Pakistan and the West,” Yusuf was quoted as saying by The Times on Saturday. The report, titled “Work with the Taliban or repeat the horror of the 1990s, West told”, came against the backdrop of support from sections of Pakistan’s political leadership for the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. Pakistan is among the very few countries that have kept their missions in Kabul open and are spearheading efforts to build consensus among regional countries for a Taliban-led set-up. “We told the West again and again this was an unwinnable war... If they had listened to Pakistan they would not be in this situation,” Yusuf was quoted as saying by The Times. The report said Yusuf is at the “forefront of a PR offensive by Imran Khan’s government to get the world to engage with the Taliban and start working with them”. The report added that Pakistan was warning other countries that the failure to work with the Taliban will result in them facing a “massive humanitarian crisis” and also “drive the new Taliban regime into more extreme behaviour and allow in foreign terrorists”. Yusuf said engagement with the Taliban is “the only way”, adding this should be “engagement today, not two weeks or three weeks from now”. This will “ensure the Taliban remain moderate and the incentive for that is legitimacy and assistance which only the West can provide,” he said. He defended the Taliban by saying there were “good” signals such as general amnesty announced by the group. He said the “political reality” was that the Taliban were in “control of 95% of the country” and also rejected criticism that Pakistani backing had helped the militant group. A statement issued by Yusuf’s office said the connotation in the report was “fabricated and totally wrongly attributed” to the NSA. It said the report in The Times was a “gross mischaracterisation” of Yusuf’s conversation with the newspaper’s reporter. “At no point did [Yusuf] state that the West should ‘immediately recognise’ the Taliban, as the article states. Nor was there any ‘warning’ of a second 9/11 linked to formal ‘recognition’ of the Taliban. This is a highly inflammatory mischaracterisation of his remarks, one that smacks of unprofessional journalism,” the statement said. “To reiterate, absolutely no threat was either intended or made, nor does the NSA subscribe to such inflammatory rhetoric. The NSA clearly stated that the world had acknowledged that abandoning Afghanistan and Pakistan in the 1990s was a mistake and presented his view that lessons from the past must be learned,” it added. The statement said demand for the report to be retracted had been sent to the newspaper by the Pakistan high commission in London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-nsa-walks-back-remarks-on-taliban-9-11-attacks-101630342005789.html

In a weekend interview to AFP, he pointed out that the group will crack down on such attacks after foreign forces leave the war-torn nation.“We hope that those Afghans who are influenced by [the] IS… will give up their operations on seeing the formation of an Islamic government in the absence of foreigners,” Mujahid was quoted as saying.He further said that if these Afghans along with the IS “create a situation for war” and continue carrying out their operations, the “Islamic government (as the Taliban prefers to call themselves) … we will deal with them.”This comes after the Islamic State-Khorasan group claimed responsibility for a rocket attack at Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport on Monday. “The soldiers of the caliphate targeted Kabul’s international airport with six… rockets,” reported AFP quoting a statement from the group.The attack comes in the backdrop of a deadly explosion by the same group last week that led to over 100 fatalities, including 13 US soldiers. The deadline for US-led forces to pull out from Afghanistan is till Tuesday, which will end the nation’s longest war in its history.Meanwhile, addressing the drone strikes carried out by the US, targeting a member of the ISIS-K in easter Afghanistan, Mujahid told AFP that there is “no permission for them [the US] to do such operations.” “Our independence must be respected,” he added.Also Read | US hits back at ISIS-K days after Kabul attack, 'kills' terrorist planner in drone strike in AfghanistanThis isn’t the first time that the Taliban blamed the presence of foreign forces for such terrorist attacks by the IS. Last week, following the blasts at the Kabul airport, Turkey’s Haberturk television quoted a Taliban official saying that the blasts occurred because of the presence of foreign forces.“As soon as the airport situation is figured out and the foreign forces leave, we will not have such attacks anymore,” the official said.Mujahid had also said that the attacks took place in an area “where US forces are responsible for security.” He condemned the bombing of civilians at the airport and said that the Islamic Emirate is “paying close attention to the security and protection of its people.”As per the latest development in the matter, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby on Monday said that the threat at Kabul airport still remains “real”, “active”, and “specific”. “We’re in a particularly dangerous time right now,” he added, according to AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-say-is-attacks-will-stop-after-us-forces-leave-afghanistan-report-101630340568129.html

30-08-2021||World||Russia warns of increase in cases of West Nile Virus: All you need to know||Russia warned on Monday of a possible increase in West Nile Virus (WNV) infections this autumn as mild temperatures and heavy precipitation create favourable conditions for the mosquitos that carry it."In light of favourable climatic conditions this year - an abundance of precipitation... a warm and long autumn, a high number of (virus) carriers could be observed in the autumn," Rospotrebnadzor, Russia's consumer health watchdog, said.More than 80% of Russia's West Nile fever cases are recorded in its southwest region.What is West Nile Virus?WNV is an infectious disease spread by infected mosquitoes. It spreads from birds to humans with the bite of an infected Culex mosquito. It can lead to a fatal neurological disease in humans.The virus causes West Nile fever in around 20 per cent of cases, according to World Health Organization (WHO). It is related to the Zika, dengue and yellow fever viruses.What are the symptoms of WNV?People who get WNV usually have no symptoms or mild symptoms. The symptoms include a fever, headache, body aches, skin rash, and swollen lymph glands. They can last a few days to several weeks, and usually go away on their own.Where did the WNV originate?According to WHO, WNV was first isolated in a woman in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937. It was identified in birds (crows and columbiformes) in Nile delta region in 1953.Before 1997, WNV was not considered pathogenic for birds, but at that time in Israel a more virulent strain caused the death of different bird species presenting signs of encephalitis and paralysis. Human infections attributable to WNV have been reported in many countries for over 50 years, the WHO said.When is it dangerous?If West Nile virus enters the brain, it can be life-threatening. It may cause inflammation of the brain, called encephalitis, or inflammation of the tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, called meningitis.How is WNV diagnosed?A physical exam, medical history, and laboratory tests can diagnose it.Who are at risk?Older people, children and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk.What is the cure?There are no specific vaccines or treatments for human WNV disease. The best way to avoid WNV is to prevent mosquito bites. Treatment is supportive for patients with neuro-invasive West Nile virus, often involving hospitalization, intravenous fluids, respiratory support, and prevention of secondary infections.Scientists have said that milder temperatures attributed to climate change could cause diseases such as the WNV to become more widespread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-warns-of-increase-in-cases-of-west-nile-virus-all-you-need-to-know-101630322044172.html
30-08-2021||World||China limits minors to just three hours of online gaming a week||China’s regulators announced a new set of tighter regulations over the country’s games industry, including limiting the number of hours that minors can play.The new rules are aimed at curbing excessive indulgence in games and protecting minors’ physical and mental health. Online game providers can only offer services to minors for an hour on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, Xinhua reported, citing a notice released by National Press and Publication Administration. They can also play only an hour a day during holidays.The new rules are part of a broader government crackdown on technology companies in the country. Tencent Holdings Ltd., China’s largest games company, had already begun to implement similar restrictions.Earlier this month, state media published forceful critiques of the industry and at one point labeled games “spiritual opium.” That description was later removed, but share prices plunged out of concern for further restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-limits-minors-to-just-three-hours-of-online-gaming-a-week-101630317835410.html

Variant, C.1.2, they warn, could be more transmissible and avoid protection offered by Covid-19 vaccines.Scientists from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and their counterparts from the KwaZulu Natal Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP) have called the C.1.2 a "potential variant of interest," which, they say, was first found in South Africa in May this year.Since then, the variant has also been located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mauritius, China, England, New Zealand, Portugal and Switzerland, the researchers claimed, adding that C.1.2 has more mutations than other variants of concern (VoC) and variants of interest (VoI) which have been detected globally till now.Their study, which is yet to be peer reviewed and was posted on the pre-print repository MedRxiv on August 24, further noted that the number of available sequences of C.1.2 may be an "underrepresentation" of the spread and frequency of the variant in South Africa, as well as across the world. It also found what it described as a "consistent" rise in the number of genomes of this new variant each month in the African nation, rising from 0.2 per cent of genomes sequenced in May to 1.6 per cent in June and, finally, to 2 per cent in July.The authors of the research termed this rise as being "similar" to the increases observed with the Beta and Delta variants in South Africa during the early stages of their detection.They also explained how C.1.2 evades protection offered by Covid-19 vaccines. "The mutations N440K an Y449H, which are associated with immune escape from certain antibodies, have been found in C.1.2 sequencing. These mutations combine with changes in other parts of the virus likely aid the latter in avoiding antibodies. This is true also for patients who have already developed antibodies for Beta and Delta variants," they wrote.According to Johns Hopkins University, South Africa, in the last 28 days, has logged 308,747 cases of the coronavirus disease. The county's cumulative infection tally stands at 2,764,931 including 81,595 related deaths.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/c12-new-variant-of-sars-cov-2-detected-in-south-africa-researchers-say-101630313058682.html

UK, Soviets and now US have burnt their hands in Afghanistan and presumably have no appetite for any military adventure in that country. Will China with its client state Pakistan, the mother of Taliban and all assorted terrorist groups, will be able to capitalize on the situation with the former exploiting the mineral resources of Afghanistan under the garb of Belt Road Initiative (BRI) and Rawalpindi getting its so-called strategic depth against India?Despite Beijing’s tremendous financial and military clout and its hold on the Pakistan’s military and civilian set-up, the answer to the above questions is no as Afghanistan has been and will be hopelessly split on tribal and ethnic lines and there are fractures within the ultra-conservative Pashtuns. Already, there are intelligence reports coming about infighting in Kandahar among the Taliban leadership for the share of political pie in Kabul.While the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) unlike the US and Soviets is not expected cross the Rubicon by becoming political or militarily active in Afghanistan, it will surely use its new friend, the Taliban, for taking action against some 500 East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) fighters whose goal is to liberate Xinjiang Uighurs from the yoke of Beijing. The ETIM fighters are mostly located in Badakshan province in north Afghanistan which links with Xinjiang in China via the Wakhan corridor. Even though the Taliban have traditionally a close relationship with the ETIM, the Pashtuns are concentrated in south and its is the minority Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, Uighur and Chechen who comprise the bulk of Taliban cadre in north Afghanistan. If the Taliban start harassing the Afghan minorities, it is these non-Pashtun elements who will join the core of Panjshir resistance in future. Already, intelligence reports from Afghanistan and Turkey indicate that the ETIM group will shift its allegiance to Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP) as they fear Taliban will act against them and hand them over to the MSS, the Chinese secret service. It is for this very reason that China wants US to redesignate ETIM as a global terrorist group, which is rather rich for a country that sat on the UN designation of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar as global terrorist for nearly three years.The other Chinese interest in Taliban regime in Kabul is to ask the Islamist leadership of Sunni Pashtun force to put pressure on their blood brother, the Tehreek-e-Taliban, across the Durand line to buy peace for their CPEC project in Pakistan. While the TTP is attacking the Chinese nationals involved in CPEC projects in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) and Occupied Kashmir, the Balochistan insurgents are militarily taking on both the Chinese and the Pakistanis in the Gwadar deep sea project. While the TTP has sworn allegiance (Bayat) to Taliban’s never to be seen supreme leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, it has made it amply clear that it will continue to target the Rawalpindi GHQ from within Pakistan and does not need the safe terror sanctuary of Afghanistan.China’s client state Pakistan may be gloating about Taliban breaking the shackles of slavery by humiliating the US forces in Afghanistan, but the future does not look so rosy for Islamabad as billions of dollars’ worth of aid in the name of war against terror from west will dry up. US and West were giving aid and grants to Pakistan, China gives only loans and that too on a souped-up interest rate and collaterals.While Pakistan may get deniability of terror attacks against India by allowing all terror factories to shift to Afghanistan under Taliban, the economic and military gap between New Delhi and Islamabad is ever widening under the Modi regime and there is a sea change from India of the 1990s. With the abrogation of article 370 and 35 A in August 2019, the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh is directly under control of the Central Government and the room for Pakistan supported Hurriyat and other local parties has nearly disappeared. To top it all, the Modi regime refuses to get black-mailed over Pakistan’s nuclear status and is ready to militarily respond to any terror attack inspired and orchestrated by Rawalpindi. Fact is that actually the strategic space for Pakistan has shrunk with China demanding its share of pie for CPEC and resurgent Taliban becoming the radicalizing force for not only all the Pashtuns on both sides of Durand Line, which is not recognized by Taliban, but also jihadists of all genre in the region. US is gone and the new Great Game has just begun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/etim-may-shift-to-iskp-with-taliban-china-alliance-over-xinjiang-101630304620049.html

The ministry's statement did not give the woman's age.The board considered that the woman’s death was due to myocarditis, which is known to be a rare side effect of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, the statement said. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle that can limit the organ's ability to pump blood and can cause changes in heartbeat rhythms."This is the first case in New Zealand where a death in the days following vaccination has been linked to the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine," the health ministry said.The Pfizer media team in New Zealand did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.The case has been referred to the coroner and the cause of death has not yet been determined, the health ministry said.The independent board, however, did consider that the myocarditis was probably because of the vaccination.The board also noted that there were other medical issues occurring at the same time which may have influenced the outcome following vaccination."The benefits of vaccination with the Pfizer Covd-19 vaccine continue to greatly outweigh the risk of both Covid-19 infection and vaccine side effects, including myocarditis," it added.So far the Pfizer/BioNTech, Janssen and AstraZeneca vaccines have been provisionally approved by New Zealand authorities. However, the Pfizer vaccine is the only vaccine that has been approved for rollout to the public.New Zealand is battling an outbreak of the Delta variant of Covid-19 after nearly six months of being virus free.It reported 53 new cases on Monday, taking the total number of infections in the current outbreak to 562.A nationwide lockdown was enforced earlier this month to beat the spread of the Delta variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-reports-first-death-linked-to-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-101630295629308.html

We have sworn to raise Pakistan’s ranks among the great nations of the world,” he was quoted as saying by The Nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-bury-this-fake-corrupt-govt-pakistan-opposition-to-imran-khan-101630294697019.html
30-08-2021||World||1st death from Hurricane Ida; power out across New Orleans||Hurricane Ida blasted ashore Sunday as one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the US, knocking out power to all of New Orleans, blowing roofs off buildings and reversing the flow of the Mississippi River as it rushed from the Louisiana coast into one of the nation’s most important industrial corridors.The hurricane was blamed for at least one death. The Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office said on Facebook that deputies responded to a home in Prairieville on a report of someone injured by a fallen tree. The person, who was not identified, was pronounced dead. Prairieville is a suburb of Baton Rouge, Louisiana’s capital city.The power outage in New Orleans heightened the city's vulnerability to flooding and left hundreds of thousands of people without air conditioning and refrigeration in sweltering summer heat.Ida — a Category 4 storm — hit on the same date Hurricane Katrina ravaged Louisiana and Mississippi 16 years earlier, coming ashore about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west of where Category 3 Katrina first struck land. Ida’s 150-mph (230 kph) winds tied it for the fifth-strongest hurricane to ever hit the mainland U.S. It dropped hours later to a Category 2 storm with maximum winds of 105 mph (165 kph) as it crawled inland, its eye about 40 miles (65 kilometers) west-northwest of New Orleans.The rising ocean swamped the barrier island of Grand Isle as landfall came just to the west at Port Fourchon. Ida made a second landfall about two hours later near Galliano. The hurricane was churning through the far southern Louisiana wetlands, with the more than 2 million people living in and around New Orleans and Baton Rouge under threat.“This is going to be much stronger than we usually see and, quite frankly, if you had to draw up the worst possible path for a hurricane in Louisiana, it would be something very, very close to what we’re seeing,” Gov. John Bel Edwards told The Associated Press.People in Louisiana woke up to a monster storm after Ida’s top winds grew by 45 mph (72 kph) in five hours as the hurricane moved through some of the warmest ocean water in the world in the northern Gulf of Mexico.The entire city of New Orleans late Sunday was without power, according to city officials. The city's power supplier — Entergy — confirmed that the only power in the city was coming from generators, the city’s Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Preparedness said on Twitter. The message included a screen shot that cited “catastrophic transmission damage” for the power failure.The city relies on Entergy for backup power for the pumps that remove storm water from city streets. Rain from Ida is expected to test that pump system.More than 1 million customers were without power in two Southern states impacted by Ida — more than 930,000 in Louisiana and 28,000 in Mississippi, according to PowerOutage.US, which tracks outages nationwide.In New Orleans, wind tore at awnings and caused buildings to sway and water to spill out of Lake Ponchartrain. The Coast Guard office in New Orleans received more than a dozen reports of breakaway barges, said Petty Officer Gabriel Wisdom. In Lafitte about 35 miles (55 km) south of New Orleans, a loose barge struck a bridge, according to Jefferson Parish officials.U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokesman Ricky Boyette said engineers detected a “negative flow” on the Mississippi River as a result of storm surge. And Edwards said he watched a live video feed from around Port Fourchon as Ida came ashore that showed that roofs had been blown off buildings in “many places.”“The storm surge is just tremendous,” Edwards told the AP.Officials said Ida's swift intensification from a few thunderstorms to a massive hurricane in just three days left no time to organize a mandatory evacuation of New Orleans' 390,000 residents. Mayor LaToya Cantrell urged residents remaining in the city on Sunday to “hunker down."Marco Apostolico said he felt confident riding out the storm at his home in New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward, one of the city’s hardest-hit neighborhoods when levees failed and released a torrent of floodwater during Katrina.His home was among those rebuilt with the help of actor Brad Pitt to withstand hurricane-force winds. But the memory of Katrina still hung over the latest storm.“It’s obviously a lot of heavy feelings,” he said. “And yeah, potentially scary and dangerous.”The region getting Ida’s worst includes petrochemical sites and major ports, which could sustain significant damage. It is also an area that is already reeling from a resurgence of COVID-19 infections due to low vaccination rates and the highly contagious delta variant.New Orleans hospitals planned to ride out the storm with their beds nearly full, as similarly stressed hospitals elsewhere had little room for evacuated patients. And shelters for those fleeing their homes carried an added risk of becoming flashpoints for new infections.Forecasters warned winds stronger than 115 mph (185 kph) threatened Houma, a city of 33,000 that supports oil platforms in the Gulf.The hurricane was also threatening neighboring Mississippi, where Katrina demolished oceanfront homes. With Ida approaching, Claudette Jones evacuated her home east of Gulfport, Mississippi, as waves started pounding the shore.“I’m praying I can go back to a normal home like I left,” she said. “That’s what I’m praying for. But I’m not sure at this point.”Comparisons to the Aug. 29, 2005, landfall of Katrina weighed heavily on residents bracing for Ida. Katrina was blamed for 1,800 deaths as it caused levee breaches and catastrophic flooding in New Orleans. Ida’s hurricane-force winds stretched 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the storm’s eye, or about half the size of Katrina, and a New Orleans' infrastructure official emphasized that the city is in a “very different place than it was 16 years ago."The levee system has been massively overhauled since Katrina, Ramsey Green, deputy chief administrative officer for infrastructure, said before the worst of the storm hit. While water may not penetrate levees, Green said if forecasts of up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain prove true, the city's underfunded and neglected network of pumps, underground pipes and surface canals likely won't be able to keep up.The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality was in contact with more than 1,500 oil refineries, chemical plants and other sensitive facilities and will respond to any reported pollution leaks or petroleum spills, agency spokesman Greg Langley said. He said the agency would deploy three mobile air-monitoring laboratories after the storm passes to sample, analyze and report any threats to public health.Louisiana’s 17 oil refineries account for nearly one-fifth of the U.S. refining capacity and its two liquefied natural gas export terminals ship about 55% of the nation’s total exports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Government statistics show that 95% of oil and gas production in the Gulf Coast region was shut down as Ida made landfall on Sunday, according to energy company S&P Global Platts.Louisiana is also home to two nuclear power plants, one near New Orleans and another about 27 miles (about 43 kilometers) northwest of Baton Rouge.President Joe Biden approved emergency declarations for Louisiana and Mississippi ahead of Ida’s arrival. He said Sunday the country was praying for the best for Louisiana and would put its “full might behind the rescue and recovery” effort once the storm passes.Edwards warned his state to brace for potentially weeks of recovery.“Many, many people are going to be tested in ways that we can only imagine today,” the governor told a news conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1st-death-from-hurricane-ida-power-out-across-new-orleans-101630293651953.html
30-08-2021||World||Rockets fly across Kabul as US evacuations wind down||Rockets flew across the Afghan capital on Monday as the United States raced to complete its withdrawal from Afghanistan, with the evacuation of civilians all but over and terror attack fears high.President Joe Biden has set a deadline of Tuesday to withdraw all US forces from Afghanistan, drawing to a close his nation's longest military conflict, which began in retaliation for the September 11 attacks.The return of the hardline Islamist Taliban movement, which was toppled in 2001 but took back power a fortnight ago, triggered an exodus of terrified people aboard US-led evacuation flights.Also Read| Several children killed in US drone strike on IS in Afghanistan: ReportsThose flights, which took more than 114,000 people out of Kabul airport, will officially end on Tuesday when the last of the thousands of American troops pull out.But US forces are now focused chiefly on flying themselves and American diplomats out safely.The Islamic State group, rivals of the Taliban, pose the biggest threat to the withdrawal after carrying out a suicide bomb attack at the airport late last week that claimed more than 100 lives, including 13 US troops.Biden had warned more attacks were highly likely, and the United States said it carried out an air strike on Sunday night in Kabul on an explosives-laden vehicle.That was followed on Monday morning by the sound of rockets flying across Kabul, according to AFP journalists in the city.People living near the airport said they heard the sounds of the missile defensive system being activated.Smoke could be seen rising near the airport.A Taliban spokesman confirmed Sunday's incident, saying a car bomb destined for the airport had been destroyed -- and that a possible second strike had hit a nearby house.The United States has been accused of killing many civilians in air strikes throughout the war, one reason for losing local support, and that was again a possibility on Sunday.Also Read| Want good India-Afghanistan relations, says Taliban leader"We are aware of reports of civilian casualties following our strike on a vehicle in Kabul today," Captain Bill Urban, a US Central Command spokesman, said in a statement.Urban said the US military was investigating whether civilians were killed, noting there were "powerful" explosions that resulted from the destruction of the vehicle."We would be deeply saddened by any potential loss of innocent life," he said.In recent years, the Islamic State's Afghanistan-Pakistan chapter has been responsible for some of the deadliest attacks in those countries.They have massacred civilians at mosques, public squares, schools, and even hospitals.Also Read| 'Went into hiding, lost relatives': How Afghan soldier's life changed in 15 daysWhile both IS and the Taliban are hardline Sunni Islamists, they are bitter foes -- with each claiming to be the true flag-bearers of jihad.Last week's suicide bombing at the airport led to the worst single-day death toll for the US military in Afghanistan since 2011.The IS threat has forced the US military and the Taliban to co-operate in ensuring security at the airport in a way unthinkable just weeks ago.On Saturday, Taliban fighters escorted a steady stream of Afghans from buses to the main passenger terminal, handing them over to US forces for evacuation.Taliban leaderThe Taliban have promised a softer brand of rule compared with their first stint in power, which the US military ended because they gave sanctuary to Al-Qaeda.But many Afghans fear a repeat of the Taliban's brutal interpretation of Islamic law, as well as violent retribution for working with foreign militaries, Western missions or the previous US-backed government.Western allies have warned many thousands of at-risk Afghans have not been able to get on the evacuation flights.On Sunday, the Taliban revealed their supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada was in southern Afghanistan and planning to make a public appearance."He is present in Kandahar. He has been living there from the very beginning," said Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid."He will soon appear in public," added deputy spokesman Bilal Karimi of the leader, whose whereabouts have remained largely unknown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-crisis-rockets-fly-across-kabul-as-us-evacuations-wind-down-101630292311564.html

Notably, Ida hit the Gulf Coast on the 16th anniversary of the disastrous Hurricane Katrina.Speaking at a Sunday meeting of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Biden said that Ida was a "life-threatening" storm."Its devastation is likely to be immense, we shouldn't kid ourselves ... Everyone should listen to the instructions from local and state officials, just how dangerous this is, and take it seriously," Biden said, adding that the states of Louisiana, Alabama and Michigan will get the "full resources of the federal government."On Sunday, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell spoke with government and state officials from Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to update them on the Biden administration's preparations for Hurricane Ida, promising assistance and help in local emergency response efforts.Also Read| Hurricane Ida lashes Louisiana, knocking out power in New OrleansBiden visited FEMA's National Response Coordination Center on Sunday (local time). On Saturday (local time), he spoke with Criswel, while the day earlier the president spoke with the Governors of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, promising full support.According to the White House, in advance of the storm, over 2,400 FEMA employees were deployed and the agency has also prepositioned millions of meals and liters of water, as well as tarps, generators, and additional ambulances. Shelters have been opened across the impacted states and the US Coast Guard has already positioned vessels and aircraft for search and rescue efforts.Also Read| Greenpiece: Lessons to be learnt from hurricane IdaBiden approved emergency disaster declarations for Louisiana and Mississippi on Friday and Saturday, respectively, authorizing direct federal help, including power generation. More than 504,000 Louisiana residents were without power on Sunday afternoon as Hurricane Ida began moving over the New Orleans area, according to poweroutage.us. The Mississippi River in New Orleans partially reversed its flow on Sunday, according to data from the US Geological Survey (USGS).Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards warned on Saturday that Ida could become one of the strongest storms to hit the US state since the 1850s, while New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell urged people to self-evacuate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prez-biden-says-hurricane-ida-likely-to-be-immense-promises-full-federal-aid-101630289704269.html
30-08-2021||World||Hurricane Ida lashes Louisiana, knocking out power in New Orleans||Hurricane Ida, making landfall as a fierce Category 4 storm, plowed into Louisiana from the Gulf Mexico on Sunday, lashing the coast with 150 mile-per-hour winds, torrential downpours and pounding surf that submerged much of the shoreline under several feet of water.All of New Orleans, Louisiana's most populous city, had power knocked out due to "catastrophic transmission damage," the local utility reported, hours after flash-flood warnings were posted.Sixteen years to the day after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, Ida slammed ashore around noon near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, a hub of the Gulf's offshore energy industry, blasting the coast with hurricane-force winds extending 50 miles (80 km) out from the eye of the storm.Residents of the most vulnerable coastal areas were ordered to evacuate days in advance. But those riding out the storm in their homes in New Orleans, less than 100 miles inland to the north, braced for the toughest test yet of major upgrades to a levee system constructed following devastating floods in 2005 from Katrina."I almost found myself in a panic attack when news announced this was the anniversary of Katrina," Janet Rucker, a lifelong New Orleans resident and recently retired sales manager who took shelter in a downtown hotel with her dog, Deuce. "This is just not good for our nerves and our psyche."The storm's approach also forced the suspension of emergency medical services in New Orleans and elsewhere across a state already reeling from a fourth wave of Covid-19 infections that has strained Louisiana's healthcare system.For an estimated 2,450 Covid-19 patients hospitalized statewide, many in intensive care units, evacuation was not an option.A loss of generator power at the Thibodaux Regional Health System hospital in Lafourche Parish, southwest of New Orleans, forced medical workers to manually assist respirator patients with breathing while they were moved to another floor, the state Health Department confirmed to Reuters.Farren Clark, a Nicholls State University professor who studied Katrina's impact and was riding out the storm at his mother's home in Thibodaux, called the arrival of Ida "nerve-wracking.""I can hear the howl of the storm getting stronger," he told Reuters by phone. "Having done research on Katrina, it is a little bit triggering."Michael Lewis, 45, restaurant owner in nearby Houma, said he could see shingles blown off his roof and a downed fence through a window of his home but was unable to check the full extent of damage as the storm raged."It's way too dangerous to go outside right now," he said in a phone interview.Officials of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said they expected the city's newly reinforced levees to hold, though they said they said the flood walls could be overtopped in some places."This is one of the strongest storms to make landfall here in modern times," Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said at a news briefing.Hundreds of miles of new levees were built around New Orleans after flooding from Katrina inundated much of the low-lying city, especially historically Black neighborhoods. That monster storm claimed more than 1,800 lives.Edwards voiced confidence in the billions of dollars in levee improvements since then, saying they were "built for this moment."WIDESPREAD OUTAGESPower outages were widespread in the first hours of the storm, with more than 750,000 Louisiana homes and businesses losing electricity by Sunday night, according to state utility Entergy Louisiana."As soon the storm passes, we're going to put the country's full might behind the rescue and recovery," President Joe Biden said after a briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington.Biden earlier said 500 federal emergency response workers were standing by in Texas and Louisiana.Just three days after emerging as a tropical storm in the Caribbean Sea, Ida had intensified into a Category 4 hurricane and swept ashore with top sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour), the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported.Within hours, as Ida crept closer to New Orleans, its sustained winds had diminished to 120 mph, ranking it as a Category 3 storm but one still considered a life-threatening major hurricane, according to the NHC.Palm trees trembled as rain blasted in sideways through New Orleans on Sunday, where retiree Robert Ruffin, 68, had evacuated with his family to a downtown hotel."I thought it was safer," he said. "It's double-trouble this time because of Covid."Inundation from Ida's storm surge - high surf driven by the hurricane's winds - was reported to be exceeding predicted levels of 6 feet (1.83 m) along parts of the coast. Videos posted on social media showed storm surge flooding had transformed sections of Highway 90 along the Louisiana and Mississippi coast into a choppy river.The NHC also warned of potentially catastrophic wind damage and up to 2 feet (61 cm) of rainfall in some areas.The governor warned it could take 72 hours for emergency responders to arrive to hard-hit places. Some parishes imposed curfews beginning Sunday evening."We're as prepared as we can be, but we're worried about those levees," said Kirk Lepine, president of Plaquemines Parish, and one of the most vulnerable areas along Gulf Coast.The parish later issued an alert on Facebook urging residents of one area to seek higher ground after reports of an overtopped levee."Everyone who cares about New Orleans is worried," said Andy Horowitz, a history professor who wrote "Katrina: A History, 1915-2015." Horowitz fled to Alabama with his family from their home near New Orleans' French Quarter.Offshore energy operations in the region were at a virtual standstill. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) said nearly 300 offshore oil and gas platforms were evacuated, cutting Gulf-based petroleum and natural gas production by 96% and 94%, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-ida-lashes-louisiana-knocking-out-power-in-new-orleans-101630290702340.html

The cable relayed reports of staffers being harassed, being spat on and cursed at by Taliban fighters at checkpoints."Our local staff and their families have suffered hardship, pain and loss because of their dedication to working with us to build a better future for all Afghans. We have a special commitment to them because of that," a State Department spokesperson had said.The United States and its partner countries in a joint statement on Sunday reaffirmed their commitment to ensuring the safe travel of their citizens and at-risk Afghans outside Afghanistan.Since August 14, the US has evacuated and facilitated the evacuation of approximately 114,400 people. Since the end of July, the US has relocated approximately 120,000 people.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday had said that the US will be engaging with the Taliban to ensure the safe evacuation of people from Afghanistan following the August 31 deadline for withdrawal,"The President directed the Secretary of State to continue diplomatic efforts with international partners to secure means for third-country nationals and Afghans with visas to leave the country even after the US military presence ends," Psaki had said during a press briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-evacuated-all-afghan-embassy-staff-report-101630283805613.html
30-08-2021||World||Several children killed in US drone strike on IS in Afghanistan: Reports||Several Afghans, including children, were killed in a drone strike in Afghanistan's Kabul on Sunday that the US said killed an Islamic State suicide car bomber suspected of preparing to attack the airport in the capital city, according to reports. CNN reported citing relatives and a local journalist that nine members of one family, including six children, were killed in the strike targeting a vehicle in a residential neighbourhood of Kabul. The youngest child was a two-year-old girl, the brother of one of the dead told a local journalist working with CNN."All the neighbours tried to help and brought water to put out the fire and I saw that there were five or six people dead. The father of the family and another young boy and there were two children. They were dead. They were in pieces. There were [also] two wounded,” Ahad, who said he was a neighbour of the family, told CNN.The Associated Press reported citing an unnamed official in Afghanistan that three children were killed in the drone strike on Sunday.Also watch | Afghan children killed in US drone strike? | Rocket attack bid at Kabul airportAfter the CNN report, the United States said it is investigating whether civilians may have been killed in the airstrike and that it would be “deeply saddened by any potential loss of innocent life". "We are aware of reports of civilian casualties following our strike on a vehicle in Kabul today. We are still assessing the results of this strike, which we know disrupted an imminent ISIS-K threat to the airport,” Captain Bill Urban, a Central Command (CENTCOM) spokesperson, said in a statement.He was using an acronym for the Afghanistan branch of the Islamic State group, which carried out a suicide attack at the airport on Thursday.Also read | Afghan TV anchor relays Taliban message surrounded by armed fighters"We know that there were substantial and powerful subsequent explosions resulting from the destruction of the vehicle, indicating a large amount of explosive material inside that may have caused additional casualties," Urban continued. "It is unclear what may have happened, and we are investigating further.”According to officials, a US drone strike blew up a vehicle carrying “multiple suicide bombers” from Afghanistan's Islamic State affiliate on Sunday before they could attack the ongoing military evacuation at Kabul's international airport. The strike was the second carried out by US forces in Afghanistan since an Islamic State suicide bomber struck the airport on Thursday, killing 13 US troops and scores of Afghan civilians trying to flee the country.Also read | Want good India-Afghanistan relations, says Taliban leaderTwo US military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations, called the airstrike successful and said the vehicle carried multiple bombers.US navy Captain Bill Urban, a military spokesperson, said the strike was carried out in “self-defence” and that the military was investigating whether there were civilian casualties but that “we have no indications at this time.”“We are confident we successfully hit the target. Significant secondary explosions from the vehicle indicated the presence of a substantial amount of explosive material,” Urban said.Sunday’s drone strike came just two days before the US is set to withdraw the last of its troops, ending America's longest war.Meanwhile, the US state department said in a statement signed by around 100 countries, as well as Nato and the European Union, that they received “assurances” from the Taliban that people with travel documents would still be able to leave the country. The Taliban have said they will allow normal travel after the US withdrawal is completed on Tuesday and they assume control of the airport.Also read | Committed to safe passage of citizens, Afghan allies, say US and other nationsUS President Joe Biden vowed to keep up the airstrikes, saying on Saturday that another attack was “highly likely” as the state department called the threat “specific” and “credible.”The Taliban have increased security around the airport after Thursday's attack, clearing away the large crowds that had gathered outside the gates hoping to join the airlift.Tens of thousands of Afghans are trying to flee Afghanistan since the Taliban's rapid takeover earlier this month, fearing reprisals and a return to the harsh form of Islamic rule the group imposed by the group from 1996 to 2001.The Taliban have pledged amnesty for all Afghans, even those who worked with the US and its allies. But many Afghans are sceptical about the assurances and there have been reports of executions and other human rights abuses in areas under the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/several-children-killed-in-us-drone-strike-on-is-in-afghanistan-reports-101630282601336.html

30-08-2021||India||Social media firms seek clarity on IT rules; self-explanatory, says govt||Even as social media companies such as Twitter and Facebook await clarity about a standard operating procedure for the new social media and intermediary guidelines, a ministry of electronics and information technology official on Monday said that the rules are self-explanatory.The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021 were notified by the Centre on February 25, and came into effect on May 25. “It is very clear that the agency administering a particular law will be the appropriate government authority, whether it is under the state government or the Centre,” the IT ministry official said on condition of anonymity.The official added that even as the government works on the SOP, the rules for the removal of unlawful content are clear.“An intermediary, on whose computer resource the information is stored, hosted or published, upon receiving actual knowledge in the form of an order by a court of competent jurisdiction or on being notified by the Appropriate Government or its agency under clause (b) of sub-section (3) of section 79 of the Act, shall not host, store or publish any unlawful information, which is prohibited under any law...,” said the relevant section in the guidelines. At least five industry bodies wrote to the ministry in May, seeking an SOP for better implementationHT reached out to Facebook and Twitter for a response but did not receive any till the time of going to press. Industry officials, however, claim that there is a lack of clarity on definition of “appropriate government (authority)”.Apar Gupta, executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, an NGO, said the power to demand removal of unlawful content posted on intermediaries is abused by police departments and there have been instances when it was used to block content even before an FIR was filed. “The government justification is correct to a reasonable extent; it doesn’t have to define appropriate government , which already includes central and state agencies that operationalise particular areas of work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/social-media-firms-seek-clarity-on-it-rules-self-explanatory-says-govt-101630347852142.html

30-08-2021||India||Sumit, Avani in historic gold rush at Tokyo Paralympics||Sumit Antil, a 23-year-old javelin thrower from Haryana, lit up Tokyo’s Olympic Stadium to earn India its second gold in a matter of hours at the Paralympics, smashing his own world record in the F64 category (62.88m set at the 2019 World Para Athletics Championships in Dubai) three times out of the total six attempts. Throw No 1: 66.95m, world record. Throw No. 2: 68.08m, world record. Throw No. 5: 68.55m, world record. His efforts made it an unforgettable day for Indian javelin throwers at the Tokyo Paralympics. It was also an unforgettable day for India. Five medals were won on a Manic Monday — an incredible single-day haul that eclipsed its entire tally of four at the 2016 Rio Paralympics. India’s medallists comprised 19-year-old shooter Avani Lekhara, who became the first Indian woman to win gold at the Paralympics; 40-year-old javelin champion Devendra Jhajharia, who won silver to become the only Indian with three individual Paralympic medals; Sundar Singh Gurjar, who finished behind Jhajharia for bronze; Yogesh Kathuniya with a discus throw F56 silver; and Sumit Antil rounding off the day just like it began from Lekhara — with a golden touch and a world record.At the Asaka shooting range in Tokyo, teenage shooter Lekhera overcame a nervous qualification round where she barely squeezed through, only to find such perfect form in the final that she even hit a 10.9 — the highest score— en route to a world record-equalling score of 249.6 and the gold in women’s 10m Air Rifle SH1 (athletes with lower limb impairment). “I was just telling myself one thing…that I have to take one shot at a time,” Lekhara said over the phone. “There’s nothing else that matters now, just one shot at a time and just finish it. “I can’t describe this feeling, I’m feeling like I’m on top of the world. It’s unexplainable,” she said. It was not only at the range in Tokyo that Lekhara overcame her fears and internal turmoil — they have been her constant companion since that fateful day in 2012 when she met with a traffic accident and suffered injuries in her spinal cord. It needed a surgery and she was paralysed below the waist. Before the accident, Lekhara was a playful child who loved dancing. “But after that everything changed,” she said. “I was very angry at my physical condition. I did not want to speak to anyone.”Lekhara ’s parents desperately needed something to revive her spirit, so her father took her to an archery range and a shooting range. She immediately found a love for the rifle. “To reach the top after recovering from massive physical setbacks suffered as a 10-year-old due to no fault of yours, shows the kind of mental resilience, courage and focus you possess.... A medal cannot come close to measuring the impact of what you have accomplished at such a young age,” Abhinav Bindra, India’s first individual Olympic gold medallist, said on Twitter. A few hours after Lehkera’s golden run, at the Olympic stadium in Tokyo, Antil, also the victim of a traffic accident, added to India’s gold tally with his own record-breaking spree. “I didn’t quite understand what was happening around me. It was like a dream,” Antil said over the phone. Having breached the 65m mark in domestic competitions earlier this year, Antil was confident that he had the script to rewrite the record. “I knew I would break the world record. I wanted to touch 70m. Till the last throw, I was going for that 70m mark,” he said. Not that he thought it would be a walk in the park. “It was a tough field. I was under a lot of pressure. I didn’t sleep well the entire night,” he said. He also couldn’t sleep for months together in 2015, when the youngster from Sonepat met with an accident while on his bike, which forced his left leg to be amputated from below the knee. Antil had lost his father, who was in the Indian Air Force, when he was just seven and had always dreamt of joining the armed forces as a way of carrying forward the legacy. “I hit the lowest point mentally during that period. My dream was to get into the army, which couldn’t happen after my disability. It broke my dreams, and it broke me along with it,” Antil said. His mother pushed him to start picking up the pieces again. Antil, a big, muscular man, had an interest in sport, and was a wrestler — “but not at a good level” — before his accident. In 2016, Antil got fitted with an artificial leg and a year later he was made aware of para sports, and was introduced to the javelin by coach Virender Dhankhar. “The moment I saw the sport I knew that this is what I wanted to do. I never looked back after that,” Antil said. With his final record-setting throw, Antil let out a huge roar, lifting both fists in the air. “We are seeing some incredible performances in the Paralympics. Avani won gold medal, Sumit won the gold medal in javelin with a world record. Devendra bhaisahab, Sundar all of them are giving excellent performances. Somewhere I feel we are not following the Paralympics that much. So I would ask everyone to please follow and support them because despite such struggles they have gone there and winning medals for the country. Please support and cheer for them,” javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, who won India’s first ever track and field Olympics gold in Tokyo earlier this month, said in a video on Twitter. Antil’s roar was similar to the one let out by another Indian, almost twice his age, in the same stadium hours earlier. Devendra Jhajharia had seen his F46 world mark of 63.97m, set in Rio, overhauled by Sri Lanka’s Dinesh Herath with an effort of 67.79m. With throws of 60.28 and 60.62 from his first two attempts, the two-time Paralympic gold medallist knew he had to raise the bar, like he so often has in the past. And so Jhajharia loaded up, his javelin moving up and down above his right shoulder while taking deep breaths. Then came the big throw and a scream that lasted as long as the javelin swirled in the air. When it finally landed at 64.35m, his personal best, Jhajharia screamed again, his face a picture of fury. Moments later, that face wore a smile, and shouldered the India flag. At 40, Jhajharia had won his third Paralympic medal, a silver.“Our athletes continue to shine at the Paralympics! The nation is proud of Sumit Antil’s record-breaking performance in the Paralympics. Congratulations Sumit for winning the prestigious Gold medal. Wishing you all he best for the future,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi told Antil over phone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sumit-avani-in-historic-gold-rush-at-tokyo-paralympics-101630347225087.html
30-08-2021||India||NTAGI may discuss kids’ vaccination against Covid-19 this week||With schools in many states reopening, with restrictions, and the government on August 20 approving the first vaccine for those over the age of 12, the big questions in every parent’s mind have been when the vaccination of children is likely to start, and who will be eligible for the first vaccines. These will likely be answered this week with the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) likely to meet this week to discuss the modalities of vaccination for those over the age of 12, according to people familiar with the matter. One of them, a senior government official, added that there may be a phased approach to vaccinating those over the age of 12 years, much like there was with the adult population, with children considered vulnerable to the disease getting the first jabs. “The list of comorbidities will be specified as it was done in adults; while in adults, age was a major criteria, in the case of children, it is likely going to be the comorbid conditions that will be the deciding factor for eligibility,” this person said on condition of anonymity. The health conditions that are likely to get included are all types of cancers, congenital heart disease, and chronic liver and kidney or lung diseases . Children who have undergone an organ transplant will also be prioritised. On August 23, NTAGI chairman N K Arora said, “Children with comorbidities will be given preference when paediatric vaccines are introduced in the system, be it Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D or Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, or the one that the Serum Institute of India is testing among children.” ZyCoV-D became the first vaccine to be approved for use on children although it is still not clear whether it will be reserved for that purpose or become another vaccine in India’s vaccine drive, which has gathered significant momentum in recent weeks.Zydus expects 50 million vaccine doses to be available by January. There are around 165 million people in the 12-17 age group. In a press briefing last week, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said ZyCoV-D will likely be available for use by October. “There is still a month or so for experts to decide; by the time paediatric vaccines will be available for use for the national programme, a decision should already be made on this,” the first person added. Bharat Biotech is also conducting trials of its vaccine on children and the results are expected soon. Experts believe it is better to prioritise vaccines if there is a supply constraint. “It is important to vaccinate all eligible children because they also run the risk of exposing the whole family, especially the elderly and sick y,” said Dr JS Bhasin, director and head, department of paediatrics, BLK Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ntagi-may-discuss-kids-vaccination-against-covid-19-this-week-101630346384498.html
30-08-2021||India||Haryana, Punjab CMs trade barbs over farmers’ protests||Chandigarh: A verbal battle erupted between the chief ministers of Punjab and Haryana on Monday over the ongoing farm protests as controversy raged over police action on cultivators two days ago in Karnal and farm groups issued an ultimatum to the state government. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Karnal magistrate Nishant Yadav shielded under-fire sub-divisional magistrate,Ayush Sinha, who stirred a row on Saturday by instructing police to “break the heads” of farmers during a protest against three central laws. Farm groups say police thrashed protesters without any provocation. One person died and another 10 were injured. “He (Sinha) should not have used such language though it is the job of officials to enforce law and order. I’m not saying he should not have enforced the rule of law strictly,” he said. The chief minister clarified that Sinha was deputed at a spot about 10-12 kilometres away from the spot where the lathi charge took place. A 2018 batch officer, Sinha was heard instructing police personnel to hit farmers on the head if they broke barricades to disrupt a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) meeting on Saturday. “Some words shouldn’t have been used. As head of Karnal administration, I express my regret. But SDM, on duty, is a sincere officer. He used some words in heat of the moment, he shouldn’t have. But his intention wasn’t wrong,” said Yadav. Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala had on Sunday promised action against Sinha amid mounting criticism of the lathi-charge on farmers.Khattar accused the Congress government in Punjab of driving the farmers’ agitation against the BJP-led Centre’s three farm laws. “There is a clear hand of the Punjab government in it,” said Khattar. “It’s a harsh reality,” he added.Later in the evening, he posed a series of questions to Punjab CM Amarinder Singh. He said Haryana procured 10 crops at minimum support prices, provided incentives, late payment fees and irrigation facilities, and asked what Punjab had done for farmers. Khattar said the protesting farmers should adhere to norms of democracy. “This agitation is not gaining anything due to such acts of disruption. The public sentiment is turning against them,” he said.“A positive dialogue was held between these protestors and district administration wherein they had given written consent that they would only protest in a symbolic manner and will not violate the law-and-order situation. However, it is really unfortunate to see that how at the behest of some politically motivated leaders, they had broken their promise,’’ the CM added.Hours later, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh hit back. “The BJP’s adamant refusal to revoke the laws reflected the vested interests of the party and its leadership, which had once again placed their crony capitalist friends over the common man....the crisis would not have assumed such grave proportions had the BJP heeded the farmers’ concerns and empathised with them,” he said. He said Khattar’s “anti-farmer” agenda was exposed. “Can’t you see that the farmers of your own state are angry with you for your apathetic attitude towards them and your party’s stubborn refusal to repeal the farm laws?” he asked.The lathi charge on protesters has sparked protests across Punjab and Haryana with farm groups blocking highways in several places. On Monday, farmers from across the state gathered for a mahapanchayat in Gharaunda town and sought registration of a case against those involved in the lathi charge. They also threatened to lay siege to the secretariat if their demands were not met by September 6. “Our brothers suffered injuries in the lathi charge...Officials involved in it, be it the SDM or police officials, a case against all of them should be registered,” said Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni. The three farm laws were passed last year but sparked almost immediate protests from farmers in Punjab, Haryana and other states. Since last October, tens of thousands of farmers have been siting in protest against the laws on the edges of the Capital -- a majority of whom hail from the foodbowl states of Punjab and Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-punjab-cms-trade-barbs-over-farmers-protests-101630345963667.html
30-08-2021||India||At UNSC meet, India seeks early Israel-Palestine talks to achieve 2-state solution||India on Monday called for early talks between Israel and Palestine to “resolve all final status issues and achieve a two-state solution”, saying the world community and the Middle East Quartet have a key role in reviving negotiations.Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla outlined India’s position while chairing a United Nations Security Council meeting on the Middle East peace process and the Palestinian question as part of India’s presidency of the council for August. This was among the last few key meetings chaired by India before the end of its presidency.India, Shringla said, will back all efforts to revive the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians.“High-level interaction between Israel and Palestine contributes to a better environment for the resumption of direct peace negotiations. We hope to see early commencement of these negotiations between the two sides, as they provide the best opportunity to resolve all final status issues and achieve a two-state solution,” he said. The international community, particularly the Middle East Quartet which consists of the UN, the European Union, the US and Russia, has an important role to play in reviving negotiations, he said.“Given our long-standing and firm commitment to the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine, within secure, recognised and mutually agreed borders, living side by side with Israel in peace and security, India will remain fully supportive of all efforts to restart the peace process,” he added.Shringla reiterated India’s concerns at the recent escalation in the Gaza Strip, which highlighted the fragility of the ceasefire in the region and the need to addressing underlying causes which triggered the escalation. “We call on all parties to the conflict to respect the ceasefire and refrain from acts that could exacerbate tensions and worsen the security situation,” he said. He noted that the West Bank continued to witness incidents of violence and clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces, and said both sides must desist from provocative action. “We note the progress in the legal challenge to the eviction of Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah and underscore the need for respecting the historic status quo in East Jerusalem and its neighbourhoods. We also urge parties to refrain from unilateral measures that undermine the viability of the two-state solution,” he said.While seeking a “regular and predictable” transfer of aid and essential items to Gaza to ease the humanitarian situation, Shringla called on the international donor community to support the reconstruction of the region through the Palestinian Authority. Israel’s decision to increase work permits issued to Palestinians will help strengthen the Palestinian and Israeli economies, and the recognition of Covid-19 vaccination certificates issued by the Palestinian Authority and facilitating the passage of patients from the Gaza Strip to the West Bank are positive signals. India’s development cooperation is geared towards creating opportunities for the socio-economic development of the Palestinians, and the country has helped build schools, set up ICT and vocational training centres, a technology park and a national printing press. During India’s presidency of the UN Security Council, the body discussed several peace and security issues, such as the situation in Afghanistan, Myanmar, Syria and Yemen, and the Middle East peace process.Shringla chaired four meetings of the Security Council on Monday that adopted the Mali sanctions resolution, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) resolution and the UNSOM resolution.The UNIFIL resolution extended the mandate of the peacekeeping mission for one more year. India is one of the largest troop contributors for UNIFIL and has been providing forces to the mission for 21 years. Currently, 862 Indian peacekeepers are serving in UNIFIL, and India has shown readiness to strengthen the UNIFIL maritime task force by deploying a maritime contingent.The Mali sanctions resolution condemned the activities in Mali and Sahel region of the Islamic State, al-Qaeda-linked terrorist groups such as IS in West Africa Province, IS in the Greater Sahara, and Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin. India has provided soft loans worth $353.6 million for developmental projects in Mali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-unsc-meet-india-seeks-early-israel-palestine-talks-to-achieve-2-state-solution-101630344824194.html

30-08-2021||India||Not paint or curry, Kerala man caught with gold layered in his jeans||At a glance, it looks like jeans splattered with paint or curry, but it was not. Customs officials arrested a person from Kannur international airport on Monday after they found that he was wearing double-layered jeans in which gold-laced paste worth ₹14 lakh was hidden, officials said. The officials said though he cleared the initial check, they got suspicious about the thick jeans he was wearing. After removing the artfully crafted jeans, they found gold paste filled in between and said it took almost two hours to remove layers to retrieve the paste. Officials said this is the first time they came across such a smuggling technique. “Air intelligence unit at Kannur international airport seized 302 grams of gold in the form of a very thin paste, concealed within the double-layered pants worn by a passenger,” said the Kochi customs unit in a tweet. The accused had come from the United Arab Emirates and was arrested later. Officials admit that gold mixed in the form of paste with some impurities is difficult to trace and smugglers resort to ingenious methods to dodge the officials. Date seeds, thick bra straps, heavy belt buckles, shoe soles, sausages and gold paste are among some of the items the ingenious smugglers try in order to smuggle gold in. Last year, in Kozhikode, a passenger was arrested after gold was detected in his facemask. A woman passenger, carrying her baby, was found holding a water bottle made of gold. According to officials, hiding gold in cavities and swallowing gold capsules are also common. Kerala tops in the country in terms of gold seizures. Last year, 550 kilograms of gold was seized from four airports with the Kozhikode airport topping the chart for maximum seize.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-paint-or-curry-kerala-man-caught-with-gold-layered-in-his-jeans-101630338884091.html

Soon other posters (will be) ready and (become) part of the website,” he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Upadhyay said that Nehru’s name was mentioned 17 times in the NCERT book of modern India, and his images appeared multiple times as well.Following the release of the poster, which is part of the ICHR’s series of lectures and seminars on the theme of ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ celebrations, several opposition leaders, including Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and Shiv Sena leader Priyanka Chaturvedim have slammed the Centre over the issue.Also Read | Oppn slams govt over absence of Nehru’s image on Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav posters“It is not merely petty, but absolutely ahistorical to celebrate Azadi by omitting the pre-eminent voice of Indian freedom, Jawaharlal Nehru. One more occasion for ICHR to disgrace itself. This is becoming a habit,” Tharoor tweeted.He also told ANI on Monday that any attempt to "rewrite history in [such] petty way" must be stopped. "It's like making a movie poster without the hero. Nehru must be there. This poster should be withdrawn," he was quoted as saying.It's like making a movie poster without the hero.

He must rise above his prejudices and tell ICHR to fix it,” he was quoted as saying.Upadhyay said, “I cannot go to the side of any political commentary but as a research organisation of history, I am again telling you that there are many posters on the website of ICHR, which are to be scrolled and it will be difficult to identify which is the first poster and which (one is) the second because they will continue to scroll.”He added the technical team of the organisation “could not put all the posters at the right time” and a controversy arose “after the very first poster which is not right.”The poster included Mahatma Gandhi, BR Ambedkar, Sardar Patel, Netaji Subhas Bose, Rajendra Prasad, Madan Mohan Malaviya, Bhagat Singh, and Hindu Mahasabha founder Vinayak Damodar Savarkar as freedom fighters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nehrus-image-could-be-in-next-poster-says-ichr-chief-amid-controversy-101630332657234.html

The disease has affected more than two dozen people in the district.The medical teams took samples from people in Koh village of Mathura district after reports of infection from the area. These samples were later found to be infected with scrub typhus, according to Livehindustan report.What is scrub typhus?According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), scrub typhus is a disease caused by a bacteria called Orientia tsutsugamushi. It is also known as bush typhus.The infection spreads to people through bites of infected chiggers (larval mites).What are the symptoms?The symptoms of scrub typhus are similar to symptoms of many other vector-borne or rickettsial diseases and usually begin within 10 days of being bitten, according to CDC. These include fever and chills, headache, body aches, rashes and muscle pain.The site where the chigger bites develops a dark, scab-like region, which is also known as eschar. After contracting the infection, a person can experience mental changes, ranging from confusion to coma, according to CDC. Some of the patients also develop joint pains, which is characteristic of chikungunya. The infection can lead to respiratory distress, inflammation of the brain and the lungs, kidney failure and then multi-organ failure, ultimately leading to death.Is there a vaccine available for scrub typhus?According to CDC, no vaccine is available to prevent scrub typhus. It suggested that the risk of contracting the infection by avoiding contact with infected chiggers.The agency also said that when travelling to regions where scrub typhus is common, people should avoid areas with lots of vegetation and brush where chiggers may be found.Apart from India, cases of scrub typhus have been reported from rural areas of Indonesia, China, Japan and northern Australia.How to treat the infection?The CDC says that if someone gets infected by scrub typhus, the person should be treated with the antibiotic doxycycline. People who are treated early with doxycycline usually recover quickly, according to the agency.The CDC further advises people to dress children in clothing that covers arms and legs, or cover crib, stroller, and baby carrier with mosquito netting in order to keep scrub typhus at bay. It also asked them to treat clothing and gear with 0.5% permethrin as it kills chiggers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scrub-typhus-all-you-need-to-know-about-mystery-infection-being-reported-in-up-101630331864608.html

30-08-2021||India||Covid third wave intensity expected to be 1/4 of second wave, say experts||India may see a third wave of COVID-19 peaking between October and November if a more virulent mutant than the existing ones emerge by September, but its intensity is expected to be much lower than the second wave, a scientist involved in the mathematical modelling of the pandemic said on Monday.Manindra Agrawal, an IIT-Kanpur scientist who is part of the three-member team of experts that have been tasked with predicting any surge in infections, said if no new virulent emerges, then the situation is unlikely to change.If the third wave peaks, the country may see only 1 lakh daily cases as against more than 4 lakh when the deadly second wave was at its peak in May. The second wave killed thousands and infected several lakh."Status Quo is when no new mutant comes and New Variant is when 50% more infectious mutant comes by September. As one can see, the only scenario with some semblance of third wave is New Variant one for epsilon = 1/33. In this scenario, new cases rise to ~1 lakh per day," Agrawal tweeted.Last month, the model suggested that the third wave could peak between October and November and the daily cases could shoot between 1.5 lakh to 2 lakh every day if a more virulent mutant of SARS-CoV2 drive fresh infections.However, no mutant that was more infectious than the Delta, which drove the infections during the third wave, emerged.Last week's forecast was the same, but only the range of daily cases has been brought down to 1-1.5 lakh in the latest one.With the fresh data, the daily infections are further expected to drop in the range of a lakh.Agrawal said the fresh data comprising the vaccinations that have taken place in July and August, the sero-surveys that gave insights about the anti-bodies were factored in while assuming the scenarios. According to a study by the researchers of Institute of Mathematical Sciences, the R or the Reproductive value of the coronavirus pandemic was 0.89. It is necessary that the R value is under one that can help arrest the spread of infection.Vaccination has been the biggest weapon worldwide to combat coronavirus and more than 63 crore doses have been administered in the country, according to the CoWIN dashboard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-third-wave-intensity-expected-to-be-1-4-of-second-wave-say-experts-101630329551122.html
30-08-2021||India||Tomato prices crash to ₹4 per kg amid supply glut in most growing states||Tomato prices in wholesale markets in most producing states have crashed to as low as ₹4 per kg amid supply glut, government data showed. In fact, the wholesale prices of tomato in 23 growing centres out of 31 monitored by the government were down by 50 per cent from the year-ago period or below three-year seasonal average.Currently, tomato crop of the early kharif (summer) season of the 2021-22 crop year (July-June) is being harvested. According to the data, the wholesale price of tomato in Dewas in Madhya Pradesh -- the countrys' top tomato growing state -- fell to ₹8 per kg on August 28 of this year from ₹11 per kg in the year-ago period.Similarly, the wholesale price of tomato at Jalgoan in Maharashtra -- the country's sixth largest tomato growing state -- fell by 80 per cent to ₹4 per kg on August 28 from ₹21 per kg in the year-ago period.Tomato prices at Aurangabad declined to ₹4.50 per kg from ₹9.50 per kg, while that of Solapur to ₹5 per kg from 15 per kg and in Kolhapur to ₹6.50 per kg from 25 per kg in the year-ago period."Prices have come under pressure in key growing states because of the supply glut. The tomato crop has been good owing to favourable weather," National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF) Acting Director P K Gupta told PTI.The tomato production from summer (early Kharif) season is estimated to be better than last year and farmers can be saved from falling prices if food processing companies come to their rescue, he said.No doubt, the favourable weather has helped boost the crop production, but farmers' tendency to grow the crop the price of which was ruling higher at the time of sowing -- has added to higher production, he added."When production is higher, prices come under pressure," Gupta said.According to the government data, wholesale price of tomato at Kolar in Karnataka -- the country's fourth largest tomato growing state -- dropped to 5.30 per kg on August 28 from ₹18.70 per kg in the year-ago period, while that of in Chickkaballapura fell to ₹7.30 per kg from 18.50 per kg in the said period.Similarly in Andhra Pradesh, the country's second largest tomato growing state, the wholesale price at Palamaner in Chitoor district fell to ₹18.50 per kg from ₹40 per kg.Palamaner and two more cities Madanpalle and Mulakalacheruvu in Chitoor district saw prices falling sharply from the year-ago period. And these three centres are identified as clusters for development under the government's 'Operation Green' programme.In Uttar Pradesh too, prices fell in the range of ₹8-20 per kg on August 28 this year from ₹14-28 per kg in the year-ago period.In West Bengal, wholesale price of tomato declined to ₹25-32 per kg in different growing areas from ₹34-65 per kg in the said period, the data showed.In consuming markets too, wholesale prices of tomatoes showed a decline.In Delhi's Azadpur mandi, wholesale price of tomato declined to 24 per kg on August 28 from ₹36 per kg in the year-ago period.Wholesale price of tomato in Mumbai declined to ₹12 per kg from ₹30 per kg, while that of in Bengaluru to ₹8 per kg from ₹30 per kg in the said period.Tomato crop is ready for harvest in about 2-3 months after planting.India's tomato production rose by 2.20 per cent to 21 million tonnes in the 2020-21 crop year (July-June) as against 20.55 million tonnes in the year-ago period, as per the Agriculture Ministry's second advance estimate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tomato-prices-crash-to-rs-4-per-kg-amid-supply-glut-in-most-growing-states-101630327203645.html
30-08-2021||India||Fake doctors a risk to lives of workers in Assam’s tea gardens||For 12 years, Simon Nag served several tea gardens in Assam as a medical officer. But his innings ended in June this year when police nabbed him for impersonating Dr Stephen Anthony, a doctor from Bengaluru presently based in Singapore. The 37-year-old, who did not pass even his Class 10 exams, served as a doctor at Mokalbari Tea Estate in Dibrugarh district and was able to dupe many during his stint in other tea gardens as well. It goes without saying that Nag was risking the lives of thousands of tea garden workers. However, Nag’s case is not an exception. In June itself, two other fake doctors working in tea garden hospitals were found in Dibrugarh district. One Eyakub Ali, the medical officer of Hatiali Tea Estate was nabbed for impersonating Dr Eyakub Ali Ahmed, an obstetrics and gynaecology specialist working in Chirang district. The same month, police in Dibrugarh registered a case against an unidentified person who was working as a doctor in Mancotta Tea Estate by impersonating Dr Hirak Das, a professor of anatomy at Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH). The accused has been on the run since. In September last year, Pankaj Kumar Nath (55), who was working as a doctor in Tinkhong Tea Estate was arrested by Dibrugarh police for practising for the past two years with the help of a forged MBBS certificate. According to government figures, there are 803 big tea gardens spread across 27 districts of Assam and run by private companies. Nearly 1 million casual workers are estimated to be employed in these gardens, where healthcare and other basic facilities like housing and drinking water are among the worst in the state. “Fake doctors are a menace. While a few of them practising in tea gardens have been nabbed, there could be more like them who have forged documents, stolen identities of genuine doctors and working at present in other tea gardens in Assam,” said Maj. (Retd.) Dr Jiten Borgohain, chairman of plantation doctors committee of Assam branch of Indian Medical Association (IMA). Borgohain, who also works as a medical officer in a tea garden, said there are several reasons why these fake doctors manage to get hired in tea gardens. Lack of uniformity employed by tea garden in appointments without any proper checks in some cases and the tendency to cut corners by appointing doctors on low salary are some of them. “The job of a doctor in a tea garden is not very attractive to most doctors...low pay, poor facilities in the hospitals and threat to personal safety are some factors. This, sometimes, has tea gardens not scrutinising applications thoroughly and appointing those who agree to work for a lower salary,” he said. He added that most of those who get appointed using fake certificates or stolen identities know a bit about what drugs should be prescribed for common illnesses and usually refer patients with serious complications or need of surgery to better government or private hospitals. “These doctors are courteous with their patients and usually keep shifting from one garden to another every few years to avoid detection. We have talked to tea companies about the need to improve their hiring process. Also, authorities need to rein in companies who hire them without proper checks,” said Dr Borgohain. Bidyananda Barkakoty, adviser of North Eastern Tea Association (NETA), an organisation of tea-planters which has around 150 members in Assam mentioned that fake doctors manage to get recruited as it is not possible for some employers to detect the forgeries and due to the scarcity of doctors sometimes appointments are made in haste. “There’s always a shortage of doctors in tea gardens and due to incidents of workers attacking medical officers after deaths of patients or when someone becomes seriously ill during treatment, it’s very difficult for companies to find people willing to work in tea garden hospitals,” he said. In September 2019, Dr Deven Dutta (73) died after workers in Teok Tea Estate in Jorhat, where he was employed, beat him up following the death of a worker. Seven doctors working in tea gardens had submitted resignations following the incident over fears of safety. Earlier the same year, Dr PC Thakur, posted in Dikom Tea Estate in Dibrugarh suffered multiple injuries after workers attacked him following death of a woman labourer. In June this year, Dr Basanta Goswami, 81, posted in Majulighur Tea Estate in Biswanath district was manhandled by workers over Covid-19 restrictions. Barkakoty said NETA would request Union minister of state for labour and employment Rameswar Teli, who hails from Assam and is a member of the tea-tribe community, to bring tea gardens in Assam under Employees’ State Insurance Scheme so that workers can avail better healthcare. “Fake doctors are getting recruited as companies are cutting corners. There are several more fake medical officers working in tea gardens. The state government should start anti-quackery units to nab such cases,” said Dr Abhijit Neog, chief operating officer of a Guwahti-based private hospital. Dr Neog’s investigation was crucial in the arrest of Simon Nag in June this year. He contacted Dr Stephen Anthony in Singapore and revealed that Nag was using his identity. A former employee of a major tea company, Neog’s investigations have led to arrests of 20 fake doctors across Assam till date. According to Tea Plantation Labourers Act, 1951, all tea gardens are required to appoint doctors for their workers. While appointments are made by tea gardens, monitoring of their work is done by the state labour department through a medical officer (plantations) in each district. At present, most of these posts are lying vacant. “In most districts, the posts of these doctors are vacant and even those who are there are not present most of the time. Till date, no study has been done on how the presence of fake doctors has affected the healthcare in tea gardens,” said Nabin Chandra Keot, vice-president of Assam Chah Mazdoor Sangha (ACMS), a Congress-backed organisation representing tea garden workers. “There should be a uniform policy on recruiting doctors in tea gardens. Besides checking credentials of doctors who are working at present some survey needs to be carried out for nurse and pharmacists as well. We had submitted a memorandum in this regard two months ago to chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma,” he added. In 2008, National Health Mission (NHM) Assam had introduced a public-private partnership (PPP) model to strengthen primary health facility in tea garden hospitals. The scheme gave funds to tea gardens to improve infrastructure as well as give additional benefits to doctors and healthcare workers. In 2019-20, Assam government launched a scheme to provide all essential drugs free of cost to all tea garden hospitals. At present 150 hospitals are running under the PPP mode. Last year, the Centre allocated ₹843.75 lakhs to these hospitals spread across 11 districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fake-doctors-a-risk-to-lives-of-workers-in-assam-s-tea-gardens-101630326163582.html
30-08-2021||India||TDP chief Naidu asks police to withdraw ‘false cases’ against party leaders||Former Andhra Pradesh chief minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) national president N Chandrababu Naidu on Monday asked the state director general of police (DGP) to withdraw “false cases” against his party leaders in connection with a statewide protest organised by TDP against the rise in fuel prices on August 28.“A section of police were harassing opposition leaders along with the general public if they exhibited any iota of dissent against the government [sic],” Naidu said in a strongly worded letter to the DGP. The TDP attempted to conduct a statewide protest against fuel hike on August 28, which led to the arrests of some of its leaders, including Chintamaneni Prabhakar, a former MLA from Denduluru.Calling the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) government’s rule “suppressive police raj”, Naidu alleged that the police arrested TDP leaders from their homes late in the night as well, and asked Andhra Pradesh DGP Gautam Sawang to take cognisance of the “deteriorating” law and order situation.Also Read | Telangana govt opposes Centre’s funding of Veligonda project in AndhraThe former chief minister claimed that on August 28, agitators demanded the rollback of petrol, diesel and essential commodity prices in a “peaceful manner”.Naidu added that Prabhakar held a peaceful demonstration,and a false case was registered against him under sections 143, 341, 290, 353, 269, 271 r/w (read with) 149 of the Indian Penal Code, and sections of 32 PA-1861, 51(a) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. He stated that Prabhakar was arrested from a wedding function in Visakhapatnam. “What was the need to arrest an opposition party leader and former MLA in such an unscrupulous manner?” the TDP national president asked. The main Opposition has a low number of leaders in Andhra Pradesh, given that the ruling YSRCP, led by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, won 151 of the 175 assembly seats in the 2019 state elections. The TDP and YSRCP often lock horns over several issues, and Naidu has often alleged police partiality ever since he lost the elections two years ago. However, the ruling YSRCP hit back against Naidu, stating that Prabhakar has 74 cases registered against him for various offences committed in the past.“Chandrababu Naidu talking about Prabhakar, who is a history sheeterdoes not make sense, as he has 74 cases registered against him. During Naidu’s time as chief minister, Prabhakar had attacked two sub-inspectors and two Mandal Revenue Officers,” said Abbaya Chowdary Kothari, YSRCP spokesperson and MLA from Denduluru seat (in West Godavari district), explaining that Prabhakar had a history of assaulting the police.“If you are writing a letter to the DGP about him, what kind of a message are you sending?” he questioned.Kothari said on August 28,Prabhakar obstructed the road with 150 people and even pushed a police officer, for which action was taken against him. “Petrol prices are high as we have to pay back oil bonds, so why can’t Naidu use his MPs and question the BJP(-led Centre)? An officer on duty was attacked, so is Naidu saying that law should not taken its own course?” he questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tdp-chief-naidu-asks-police-to-withdraw-false-cases-against-party-leaders-101630324783563.html

With this, the state has started to ramp up the vaccination drive ahead of the festive season and has achieved the target of giving 500,000 doses in a day. “In August, we have received a little above 10 million vaccine doses. In September, we have been allotted around 13 million doses. The Centre usually sends more vaccines that what is allotted. So, we hope to receive around 15 million doses. Another 1.5-2 million doses may be purchased. This is the highest so far,” said a senior official of the state health department. Till date, the state has administered 39.6 million doses out of which 11.2 million were second doses. Also Read | Health minister releases 1st Covaxin batch from Bharat Biotech’s Gujarat plant“Of late we have been able to achieve the daily target of administering 500,000 doses. On August 27, we administered 560,000 doses, the highest so far in the state. If the supply is steady, we have the infrastructure to give around 1 million doses per day,” said another official of the health department. While chief minister Mamata Banerjee has, on multiple occasions, alleged that there was a short supply of vaccines from the Centre and has sent multiple letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue, the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal had alleged that there was mismanagement of vaccines in the state. The state also managed to doses, but faced a shortfall of syringes. “From each vial,10 doses can be retrieved. But with a little efficiency, one can also retrieve 11 doses from each Covishield vial. Wastage of up to 10% is allowed in each vial. West Bengal has not only managed to stop any wastage but in many cases, we retrieved 11 doses thereby registering around 7% negative wastage. In turn, we consumed the syringes that came along with the vials,” said a senior health department official. The state is now planning to focus on how the vaccination process could be stepped up in the adjoining districts of Kolkata so that local trains could be resumed. Senior officials said while the government has managed to give at least one dose to 75% of population in urban centres like Kolkata, the government plans to vaccinate at least 50% of the population in the rural areas of adjoining districts with one dose. Local suburban trains connect Kolkata and Howrah with the villages and towns of the adjoining districts and thus form a major lifeline for the people coming to Kolkata for job every day. “The government is targeting districts such as South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly, Nadia and parts of Burdwan where 50% of the people need to be vaccinated with at least one dose before local trains resume,” said another official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-gets-highest-number-of-covid-vaccine-doses-since-january-steps-up-drive-101630324663649.html

He also claimed that there were no farmers from Haryana at Delhi’s border protesting the three farm laws passed by the Centre during the monsoon session last year.“In Punjab, he (Captain Amarinder Singh) is instigating farmers. In Haryana, (Bhupinder Singh) Hooda saheb and other Congress leaders are instigating them.

He however later said that 85% of the farmers at Delhi’s Tikri and Singhu borders are from Punjab. Khattar claimed that farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal offering sweets to Captain Amarinder Singh indicates that the Punjab government is involved in the farmer protests, according to a report by HT.He also demanded Singh’s resignation from the post of the chief minister. Khattar also blamed the farmers and said that they have ‘no intention to hold conversations’ with the government.The Haryana chief minister’s remarks came after Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha allegedly asked police to ‘crack the heads’ of protesters in a video which went viral and was also shared by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Pilibhit Varun Gandhi. Khattar said that the remarks may not have been appropriate but ‘insisted’ on ‘strictness’.Khattar faced criticism from Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday who demanded police action into the incident.

Meanwhile, some of Chandy’s erstwhile supporters, such as Thiruvanchur Radhakrishnan and PT Thomas, have asked party members to bury their differences and go by the list approved by the party high command. Some leaders opposing the list also blamed AICC general secretary KC Venugopal for the chaos but he is yet to comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/senior-cong-leader-av-gopinathan-quits-party-amid-infighting-in-kerala-101630322923638.html

30-08-2021||India||Paralympics: Rajasthan to give cash rewards to medal winners from state||Three Rajasthan athletes have won laurels for the state at the ongoing Paralympics in Tokyo, prompting the state government to announce cash rewards for them.Shooter Avani Lekhara, who won gold, will get ₹3 crore; javelin thrower Devendra Jhajharia will get ₹2 crore while his teammate Sundar Singh Gurjar will get ₹1 crore for winning silver and bronze medals respectively.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted on Monday, “All the three players have already been appointed to the post of ACF in the Forest Department of the state government. The players of the state have brought laurels to the country and the state by winning medals, we are very proud of them.” “We are proud of Rajasthan’s Paralympic javelin throwers Devendra Jhajharia, who grabbed Silver & Sundar Singh Gurjar for claiming Bronze at Men’s Javelin Throw event,” he said in another tweet. Also Read | Rajasthan runs out of funds to pay for coal, four thermal power units shut downHe also congratulated para-athlete Yogesh Kathuniya for winning a silver medal in Men’s Discus Throw at the Tokyo Paralympics. Lekhara, who created history by becoming the first Indian woman to win a gold medal at the Paralympics, won in the R-2 women’s 10m Air Rifle Standing SH1 event. She is wheelchair-bound after she met with an accident on February 20, 2012, when she was just 11. Her father Praveen Lekhara, a government employee, said, “She has worked very hard for 7-8 hours daily and is expecting at least two medals. She is participating in four events and three are still remaining. She had made everyone proud.” Devendra Jhajhariya has consistently broken his own records. In 2004, he won gold after throwing the javelin 62.15 meters; he broke his record in Rio Olympics with 63.97mts; and now, though he won a silver, the throw was 64.35 mts. His younger brother Arvind said, “We were expecting gold but it’s a game. The entire country is proud of him.” “He has been competing for the past 22 years yet, his dedication and passion are unbeatable. He works out for seven hours daily,” he said. His arm got damaged when he was eight and got electrocuted while playing near a tree. Gurjar lost an arm in 2016 after a tin shed fell on him. He practised in Sawai Man Singh stadium in Jaipur under the supervision of his coach Mahaveer Saini. His brother, Hariom, said, “The entire village is happy on the achievement. Though he was sure of winning gold medal but he missed.” A statement released by the CM’s office said that the government has sanctioned ₹5lakh each for the training of these three players. “Free training and other facilities are being provided by the Rajasthan State Sports Council to Avani Lekhara and Sundar Singh Gurjar. Avani gets training in the shooting range- Jagatpura, which has state-of-the-art facilities while Sundar gets training at the Athletics Sports Academy in the SMS stadium,” the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paralympics-rajasthan-to-give-cash-rewards-to-medal-winners-from-state-101630319203959.html

It should not happen that my father has to take an extreme step. I request you with folded hands to please give us our salaries,” the girl said in the video clip.The MSRTC runs buses across Maharashtra and is one of India’s biggest transport corporations, however, it has been incurring heavy financial losses for several years and the situation has worsened during the Covid-19 induced lockdowns. For over a year now, the MSRTC employees’ monthly salaries have been getting delayed by several weeks.Last week, an MSRTC employee Kamlesh Bedse, posted in Dhule, died by suicide, claiming he was unable to pay his debt due to his ‘low’ salary and the delays in its payment,.Jagnarayan Kahar, general secretary of the MSRTC Kamgar (workers) Union said salaries for the month of July had not been paid yet, forcing employees to take extreme steps. “We will be protesting outside all MSRTC bus depots. The work will go on but we will protest outside bus depots after work.” he said.MSRTC officials have requested the employees not to take any extreme step and assured that salaries will be disbursed immediately. “Discussions with the deputy chief minister have been done and the salary payments will be done immediately,” said Shekhar Channe, MSRTC managing director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/msrtc-employee-s-daughter-says-father-can-t-pay-fees-due-to-delayed-salary-101630318303391.html

Reacting to the developments, Gawali called the raids "tyrannical" and compared them to "Emergency". She also claimed she didn't get any notice from the ED, yet."This is being done to damage me, a five-term MP, who has been working for the people. The Shiv Sena ministers and representatives are being targeted. I have institutions, including schools and Ayurveda college, which have been raided today," the oldest-serving MP from Maharashtra told the Hindustan Times."For decades, I have been running the institutions to provide education to children and for farmers in the rural areas. I haven't grabbed land and converted them into a non-agriculture plot and neither have I utilised government funds for personal gains," she added.Taking a dig at the Bharatiya Janata Party she said the probe agency should look into the allegations of the scam against a local BJP legislator. "You can investigate me as much as you want, but at the same time you must probe the allegations against the local BJP legislator, who faces a land scam to the tune of ₹500 crore, as well," Gawali said. Earlier in the morning, Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut said the ED notices to Shiv Sena ministers are not "death warrants" but "love letters."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhavana-gawali-shiv-sena-enforcement-directorate-maharashtra-money-laundering-101630316707470.html

30-08-2021||India||Demand for caste-based census grows ahead of Uttar Pradesh assembly election||Ahead of assembly elections next year in around half-a- dozen states, including Uttar Pradesh, several political parties have intensified demand for a caste-based census and sub-categorisation of castes in the country, putting the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in a fix.Uttar Pradesh is home to as many as 79 castes that constitute the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and 66 scheduled castes (SCs) and sub-castes. However, only a handful such as Yadavs, Kurmis, Lodhs, Rajbhars, Maurya and Kushwahas among the OBCs and Jatavs, Pasis, Valmikis and Koris among the SCs have been able to get political visibility with a lion’s share in political power, economic resources and government jobs.The OBCs and the SCs together account for around 60-70% of UP’s population. The census is held in the country every 10 years but the last caste-wise enumeration was carried out in 1931 and the same data is taken into account for various purposes even today. Around 40-50% of UP’s population is estimated to be OBC while the SC population was counted at 20.7% in the 2011 census.On August 23, an 11-member delegation led by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to demand caste-wise enumeration of the OBCs in the census, to be held shortly. The Centre had informed the Lok Sabha in July that it would not enumerate caste-wise population, except those for the SCs and STs.The Samajwadi Party (SP) in UP has been the most vocal in raising the demand for the caste enumeration with the party eyeing OBCs votes, apart from consolidating the Yadavs, its core vote bank, for the 2022 assembly election.“A caste-wise tabulation of the census is necessary to achieve the objective of social justice because without knowing the numerical strength of various castes it is not possible for governments to plan and execute welfare policies for them in the right way,” SP spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary argued.He also cited Akhilesh Yadav’s slogan, “jiski jitni sankhya bhari, uski utni hissedari” (a community’s share in resources should be proportionate to its numerical strength) to highlight the relevance of caste-based census for delivering social justice.Other small regional outfits, including Anupriya Patel’s Apna Dal (Sonelal), Om Prakash Rajbhar’s Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), Sanjay Nishad’s Nishad Party, Keshav Dev Maurya’s Mahan Dal and Babu Singh Kushwaha’s Jan Adhikar Party that are led by OBC leaders, are all vocally supporting the demand for a caste-based census.Aware of the importance of caste politics in UP, the Congress, too, has backed the demand. It also claimed that it was during the last UPA government when a socio- economic caste census was carried out.“The UPA government got the caste-based census done in 2011 but the BJP did not publish the caste data after coming to power in 2014, although the party had demanded caste-based census when in Opposition,” UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said.The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) are probably the only important political players in UP that are yet to take a clear stand on this issue. BSP state president Bhim Rajbhar refused to comment on the matter while RLD leaders, including party chief Jayant Chaudhary, also refrained from taking a stand. The RLD is the SP’s potential ally for the assembly polls in 2022 but does not seem to be on the same page as far as the demand for caste-based census is concerned.Political scientist Shashikant Pandey said the demand was the natural progression of the social churning that began with the emergence of OBC leaders such as Mulayam Singh Yadav and Kalyan Singh in UP and Lalu Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar in Bihar.“I see the social churning taking a concrete shape now with the regional parties rooted in castes having their say in political affairs and dictating terms to national parties like the BJP and the Congress,” he said. Pandey is the head of the department of political science in the Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow.The caste enumeration, according to Pandey, may, however, turn out to be a double-edged sword.“The caste data that the caste-based census can yield may help governments’ welfare schemes reach the most backward and deprived castes that have been marginalised till date,” he said.“But it has a flip side too. Once the exact numbers of OBCs and SCs are known, it may further hit the interests of the marginalised castes if their numerical strength is found to be lower than what it is presumed today since resources will then be distributed as per the numerical strength of castes...,” Pandey added.Such a situation, he cautioned, may also lead to caste conflicts within the OBCs and SCs and could also further intensify the caste tensions and animosity in the society in general.“It will be very interesting to watch the after-effects of the caste-based census if it takes place,” he observed.Observers say though many political parties are demanding the caste-based census in the name of social justice, their real motive is to get the 50% cap on reservation removed or raised after the actual caste-wise data is available in the public domain.“The next logical demand after the caste census is held will be for the enactment of a law to do away with the 50% cap ceiling put by the Supreme Court on reservation,” Pandey said.Agreeing with him, social scientist Rajesh Mishra said, “Reservation for the OBCs will have to be revised, sooner or later. The 10% quota for the poor among the upper castes has opened the Pandora’s Box and weakened the legitimacy of the 50% limit.”Although the Centre has said that it will not go for caste enumeration, both Pandey and Mishra agree that it may not be possible for the BJP government at the Centre to ignore the demand any longer considering the growing importance of OBC politics, particularly in UP.“Notwithstanding political divisions among the OBC castes/classes, no political party can afford their resentment on the issue, especially in the light of the upcoming assembly polls in UP,” Mishra said.Avoiding a direct reply, UP BJP spokesman Sameer Singh said, “The Justice Rohini Commission is already working on the sub-categorisation of OBCs and once the commission presents its report, the Central government will take a call to further promote the interests of the OBCs.”The BJP government, he said, gave the Constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes and decided only recently to implement the 27% OBC quota in NEET.The BJP, according to the observers, is reluctant for a caste-based census because such an exercise is fraught with the danger of leading to a situation that was witnessed when the Mandal Commission report was dug out and implemented in 1990 and this situation will harm the BJP’s goal of uniting and mobilising Hindus.“The BJP and its parent organisation the RSS have always made a case for unity of Hindus and any caste divisions that the caste enumeration may further intensify will hamper the goal of Hindu unity. This explains the BJP’s dilemma over whether to accept or not the demand for the caste-based census and sub-categorisation in the country,” Pandey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demand-for-caste-based-census-grows-ahead-of-uttar-pradesh-assembly-election-101630312903215.html

30-08-2021||India||Ahead of polls, Congress retains Girish Chodankar as Goa unit chief||The Congress high command has decided to continue with incumbent Girish Chodankar as Goa unit chief, thus putting to rest speculations over a change of guard ahead of the assembly elections. In a statement to the media, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary KC Venugopal said the Congress president “has approved a the proposal for the continuance of Girish Chodankar as the president of Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) and Digambar Kamat as the leader of the Congress Legislature Party.” Chodankar will be assisted by Aleixo Sequeira, who has been appointed the working president. Sequeira’s appointment is being seen as a move to mollify the party’s old guard who were upset with Chodankar’s style of functioning. The decision to continue with Chodankar is along expected lines, though he has earlier resigned twice from the position-- after the party’s performance in the Lok Sabha elections in which the party chief himself lost to the BJP’s Shripad Naik from North Goa seat, and then in December 2020 after the local body polls. Also Read | New list of district heads fans discontent in Kerala CongressThe decision comes after AICC election observer P Chidambaram spent two days in the state, meeting state leaders and grassroot workers. However, Chodankar’s tenure was marked with divisions within the party and poor performance in both local bodies as well as legislative assembly elections. His tenure also saw the party steadily lose MLAs to the BJP, with just five MLAs left in its fold. Several party leaders, including MP Francisco Sardinha and Reginaldo Lourenço, had publicly called for his ouster “in the interest of the party”.Speaking to HT on the development, Sardinha said, “I said openly whatever I needed to. I respect the decision of the high command because it is they who take the decisions. If I were to take the decisions perhaps I would have decided differently. I am a loyal soldier of the party and will continue to work for the party.” Sequeira thanked the Congress leadership for assigning him an additional responsibility and said he was glad that the issue of leadership is finally laid to rest. “I had said that the issue should be sorted at the earliest. The onus is now on us to work together and ensure the victory of the Congress in 2022,” he said. In a statement, the party welcomed the appointments. “We sincerely feel that this will create a right balance between the youth and experience and Girish will have the experience to work alongside a seasoned campaigner like Sequeira. The latest appointments is another step in living up to our promise to the people that we are creating more space and opportunities and the new and the younger generation and the contestants on the Congress platform as desired by the Goan electorate,” party spokesperson Tulio de Sousa said. The Congress has also reconstituted several other committees, including a two-member election coordination committee consisting of headed by former chief minister and former PCC chief Luizinho Faleiro. The campaign committee will be headed by MLA Reginaldo Lourenço, finance committee by former CM and South Goa MP Francisco Sardinha, and manifesto committee by former Union minister Ramakant Khalap. The publicity committee will have Chandra Kant Chodankar as the chairperson and Martha Saldanha as co-chairperson.(With inputs from Umar Sofi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-polls-congress-sticks-with-girish-chodankar-as-goa-unit-chief-101630310623044.html

The Shiv Sena, in its mouthpiece Saamana, said when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was inaugurating the renovated Jallianwala Bagh complex in Amritsar, a second Jallianwala Bagh was happening in Haryana. “The seeds of cruelty being sown by the government will bear sour fruits. This is for sure...The Manohar Lal Khattar government has no right to remain in power,” the Sena said in its editorial.On Saturday, police lathi-charged a group of farmers heading towards Karnal to protest against a meeting of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which was attended by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, state BJP chief Om Prakash Dhankar and other leaders. At least 10 people suffered injuries in the police action.Also Read| Farmers’ mahapanchayat against police lathicharge in Karnal todayReferring to Union Minister Narayan Rane incident, the Sena also questioned why the critics of the Maharashtra government remained silent on Saturday’s incident in Haryana. “The farmers in Haryana were lathi-charged on their heads because they raised slogans against CM Khattar. A Union minister speaks of attacking the chief minister of Maharashtra and when action is taken against him legally, the state government is called intolerant,” the Sena, which is a part of the ruling Maha-Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra, said.The Sena also called Centre stone-hearted over the ongoing farmers' protest against the three farm laws and said that PM Modi hasn’t met the farmers, who have been protesting at the borders of Delhi, demanding the removal of the legislation.Also Read| Karnal SP says death of farmer not linked to lathi-chargeMeanwhile, the Haryana government has also come under fire over an officer’s remark about the treatment of the protesters during their protest. Ayush Sinha, Karnal’s sub-divisional magistrate, was heard in a video ordering police personnel to “break the head of the protesters” on Saturday.Several political leaders in Haryana, including deputy chief minister Dushyant Singh Chautala, have condemned the official’s remarks. Chautala promised action against Sinha and said his comments do not meet the ethical standards expected from officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnal-lathi-charge-haryana-govt-has-no-right-to-remain-in-power-says-sena-101630306187596.html

This is the first time that such a facility has been launched in Kashmir valley.Twenty-nine-year-old Abdul Majid Zargar told local publications that he launched his venture 'Novo Cabs' to serve the people of Kashmir. A Bachelor of Technology (BTech), Zargar said his venture will help the people of Kashmir, who have suffered a lot in the last few years.Zargar completed his degree from Islamic University of Science and Technology (IUST) in Awantpora in 2017. Before launching Novo Cabs, he approached Chandigarh-based cab aggregator Jugnoo in 2019 to start its service in the valley. But soon, differences cropped up and Zargar moved away, according to Rising Kashmir.Novo Cabs was officially launched on January 1 this year, said Zargar, who has adopted a unique business model. He approached the locals asking them to rent out their vehicles on commission basis, reported Rising Kashmir.The start-up so far has 100 cars attached, which can be called through a mobile application. The app captures the exact location of a customer and helps the driver to reach his/her doorstep.The app interface is similar to that of popular cab aggregator giants like Uber and Ola, but Zargar told Rising Kashmir that his company has a long way to go. He is also training the drivers to use the app and communicate with the customers.Zargar planned to launch the service in 2019, but due to abrogation of Article 370 and restrictions on internet, he had to defer his plans and move to Delhi.But now that the situation has normalised, Zargar hopes to expand the oprations of his company.Zargar is currently working as a senior UX designer with an Ahmedabad-based virtual event management company Hubilo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/novo-cabs-engineering-grad-from-kashmir-launches-valley-s-first-taxi-service-101630309378900.html
30-08-2021||India||BJP stages protests today seeking reopening of places of worship in Maharashtra||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is holding ‘Shankhanaad and Ghantanaad’ protests across the state today demanding reopening of temples and other places of worship. Key state unit leaders participated in the protest and threatened to forcefully open places of worship next week if their demand was not met. BJP’s spiritual coordination cell organised the protest against Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government’s decision to prevent entry of general public to places of worship as part of restrictions imposed to check the spread of Covid-19. The Union health ministry last week asked the state government to restrict religious activities and celebrations during coming festivals amid potential threat of a third wave of Covid. Meanwhile, BJP’s state unit chief Chandrakant Patil led the protest at Kasba Ganpati temple in Pune, while former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar led it at Babulnath Mandir in Mumbai.

They call us Khalistani. If you would call us Khalistani and Pakistani, we would say ‘Sarkari Talibani’ has occupied the country. They are Sarkari Talibanis,” said Tikait.Following the incident, a video went viral on social media, which was also tweeted by BJP MP from Pilibhit Varun Gandhi, in which Karnal sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Ayush Sinha could be seen instructing policemen to “crack their (protesting farmers’) heads” to prevent them from breaching the security barrier.Demanding an inquiry into the incident, Haryana leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said police action “shows the anti-farmer mindset of the state government.’’ He added, “It was a pre-planned attack. First, the state government creates conditions for the clash with farmers and then uses undemocratic, inhuman and cruel means against them.”Also Read | Dushyant Chautala says use of such language by IAS officer ‘condemnable’Congress leader Rahul Gandhi called out police violence against protesting farmers in Haryana’s Karnal, tweeting that it was a ‘shame’ that the farmers have to “shed blood”.With a two-line tweet in Hindi, Gandhi shared a photo of a farmer who was injured in the protest. “Again the blood of farmers is shed. India bows its head in shame,” he wrote.Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that the Khattar-led government was treating farmers like General Reginald Dyer (behind the Jallianwala Bagh massacre), refusing to allow them to protest peacefully against controversial farm laws.Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh too slammed his Haryana counterpart for “unleashing brazen brutality of the police on the peacefully protesting farmers, many of whom were injured in the lathi-charge,” news agency ANI reported.Meghalaya Governor Satya Pal Malik criticised CM Khattar and demanded an apology for the lathi charge on farmers.Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav hit out at the Haryana government. “They (farmers) were protesting against the visit of CM Khattar and other BJP leaders to Karnal.

This will be his first visit to Bahrain. Muraleedharan’s visit to the middle eastern country comes months after India and Bahrain on April 7 decided to bolster their bilateral defence and security cooperation including through regular consultations in the areas of maritime security, combating piracy and counter-terrorism.The decision was taken at a meeting of the India-Bahrain high joint commission which was co-chaired in New Delhi by external affairs minister (EAM) S Jaishankar and his Bahraini counterpart Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani. Reiterating their condemnation for all forms of terror, both countries called upon all states to reject and abandon the use of terrorism again other countries.Also Read| India, Bahrain agree to bolster defence and security cooperationAccording to a statement, Muraleedharan will also meet a wide cross-section of the Indian communities, including those in business, health, education and social service. The statement said Bahrain is home to around 350,000 Indians and the Indian community enjoys great goodwill from Bahrain's leadership.

30-08-2021||India||Nothing to worry about: Army Gen on Taliban fallout||An Indian Army general said on Sunday said the security situation in the Kashmir valley is under control and there is nothing to worry about on concerns about possible fallout of the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan.“This is a playground and I do not want to comment about the outsiders. But remember, the security situation here (Kashmir) is in our control and there is nothing to worry about it,” said Lieutenant General DP Pandey, the General Officer Commanding of the Army’s 15 Corps. He was responding to a question on potential security challenges in Kashmir after Taliban claimed control of the war torn country.The GOC’s statement, made at a sporting event in Srinagar, comes days after chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat said that India is concerned about terrorist activity in Afghanistan spilling over into the country, but contingency plans are in place to deal with such a scenario.The comments come in the wake of Taliban wresting control of Afghanistan, including capital Kabul, as Western troops left the country to end their 20-year involvement there.Rawat, the country’s senior-most military commander, also said India anticipated the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan but its rapid pace was still a surprise. “From the Indian perspective, we were anticipating the Taliban takeover. We were concerned about terrorist activity overflowing into India from Afghanistan. Our contingency planning is ongoing, and we are prepared for that,” Rawat said.With the Taliban now firmly in control of nearly all of Afghanistan, the biggest concern for Indian security agencies is the presence there of between 7,000 and 10,000 terrorists from Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Haqqani Network, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. These groups have targeted Indian interests in Afghanistan in the past, and some like LeT have carried out attacks on Indian soil.The CDS remarks at an event on August 25 also hinted at India’s stand on dealing with the Taliban.Rawat said the group, which was ousted from power in Afghanistan by US-led coalition forces in 2001, was the same Taliban that existed 20 years ago. “All that has happened is that partners have now changed. It is the same Taliban …We will make sure that any activity which is likely to flow out of Afghanistan and find its way into India will be dealt with in the manner in which we are dealing with terrorism in the country,” he had said.With evacuations of Indian citizens and vulnerable Afghans currently the focus, New Delhi has so far maintained a cautious approach on the issue of recognising a Taliban regime in Afghanistan.“The situation on the ground is uncertain...Currently, there is a lack of clarity or no clarity about any entity forming a government in Kabul. I think we are jumping the gun here regarding recognition,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said at a press briefing on Friday||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nothing-to-worry-about-army-gen-on-taliban-fallout-101630284959417.html

The "KAZIND-21" exercise will be conducted at a Kazakh training node in Aisha Bibi in Kazakhstan from August 30 to September 11 this year, the Indian defence ministry said last week."The exercise will provide an opportunity to the Armed Forces of India & Kazakhstan to train for counter-insurgency/counter-terrorism operation in the mountainous, rural scenario under UN mandate," the defence ministry said in a statement, reports news agency PTI.The statement said 90 personnel from the Bihar regiment of the Indian Army will participate in the joint exercise. The Kazakhstan army will be represented by a company group.The scope of the exercise will include professional exchange, planning and execution of operations in a counter-terrorism environment, sharing of expertise and train for counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations in the mountainous, rural scenarios under the UN mandate. "The exercise will culminate after a 48 hours long validation exercise which will involve a scenario of neutralisation of terrorists in a semi-rural hideout," the ministry said in the statement.It added that the exercise will strengthen mutual confidence, interoperability and enable sharing of best practices between the armed forces of India and Kazakhstan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-kazakhstan-joint-training-exercise-kazind-21-to-begin-from-today-101630282173228.html
30-08-2021||India||7.5km added to Bengaluru Metro’s western extension line||Bengaluru Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai and Union minister of housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri, on Sunday inaugurated the extended 7.5 kms line of the Bengaluru metro between Nayandanahalli and Kengeri on Mysuru Road after roughly two months of delay. The extension will connect two biggest cities in Karnataka.“The government is pursuing all efforts to make Bengaluru truly an international hub. The metro should have the capability to ferry many more people. There is a target to construct around 317 kms of routes,” Bommai said after the inauguration. The chief minister said that the route till Kengeri should be extended till Ramanagara, Magadi and Rajanakunte and has directed officials to draw up plans to execute the same which would take the total to 317 kms. The total length of the metro that is operational in Bengaluru is 56 kms in over 13 years. He said that another 36 kms would be completed by next year. Bommai said that the government can keep up timelines for the new proposed routes if there is early planning and perfect implementation. “Accountability of these major projects is more important than anything else,” he said, adding that the chief minister’s office (CMO) will supervise all mega projects in the city from now on. Bommai also said that within the next 20 days, a dashboard with information on all mega projects in the city will be up and ready where the monitoring of such large infrastructure initiatives will be done. “I will dedicate my first working hour of the day for supervising these mega projects of Bengaluru,” he said. Officials said that the extended line of the metro is estimated to serve around 75,000 people on average per day and connects the south-western part of the city in a direct line to the eastern corridor of KR Puram. Speaking at the inauguration, Puri said, “Bengaluru is one of the major engines of economic growth for the entire country, with (a) strong presence in information technology, biotechnology and applied sciences research. The city accounts for nearly 38% of total IT exports from the country. The Inauguration of the Western Extension Metro Line today is a step towards enabling faster commute and smart mobility options in the city.” “Journey of Bengaluru metro started with the sanction of Phase 1 in 2006 which is 42.3 km with an approved revised cost of ₹13, 845 crores. The first section of 7 km of Phase 1 commenced in October 2011 and daily passenger boarding of about 12, 500 per km of the Phase 1 pre-Covid-19 is comparable to the busiest metro network in the country next to Mumbai and Delhi,” Puri said. He added that the operational punctuality of the Bengaluru metro is 99.8% which is among the best in the country. “Since the inauguration of (the) first metro line in Delhi in 2002, today about 730 kms of metro lines are operational in 18 different cities. About 1,049 kms of metro rail / RRTS projects are under construction in various cities,” Puri added. However, the slow pace of work has made it more difficult for the average Bengalurean to depend on the metro services since it has taken over 13 years for the construction of just under 60 kms line in a city that is around 800 square kms in radius. The metro gets one of the biggest share in Bengaluru’s public expenditure but delays have escalated project costs. According to Bengaluru metro authorities, each year of delay adds 5% more to the project costs, which amounts to thousands of crores. The delays have forced people to depend on private vehicles which was exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. The fear of contracting the virus in public transport has forced many people to use private transport. This has added to the problem of the growing number of vehicles on the road in a city that was adjudged to have the worst traffic in 2019 globally. There are 9.4 million vehicles in Bengaluru, according to government estimates. The poor quality of roads, inadequate public transport, increase of private vehicles has added to the city’s crumbling infrastructure with promises on mass mobility solutions remaining a distant and delayed dream which has caused more hardships due to addition of bottlenecks to the already nasty traffic snarls. With most of the roads dug up currently in Bengaluru in the name of “smart city” and other developmental projects, the dust and vehicular emissions have taken a toll on the general quality of life due to air and water pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bluru-metro-inauguration-reignites-language-dispute-101630262441701.html
30-08-2021||India||NCB seizes marijuana worth ₹21 crore, 3 held||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Sunday said that it busted an inter-state drug racket near a toll booth on Hyderabad ring road and seized 3,400 kg of marijuana, with an approximate on-street selling price of ₹21 crores. Three persons have been arrested in connection with the case, zonal director of the NCB (Bengaluru zone) Amit Ghawate said in a statement.“Based on specific intelligence developed by NCB Bangalore, a joint team of NCB Bangalore and Hyderabad on August 28 seized a truck having Maharashtra registration and arrested three persons near (the) toll booth on Hyderabad ring road. On thorough examination, it was found that 3400 kg of ganja was concealed into the truck. It was packed systematically in 141 gunny bags,” he said on Sunday.The bust comes at a time when Karnataka has been heavily cracking down on narcotics in its continued war on drugs that continues to seep into India’s IT capital and other large cities through intricate networks and innovative ways to avoid detection.In this case, the gunny bags were concealed under tarpaulin sheets and covered by varieties of nursery saplings in large quantities in the truck. “It was difficult to detect the contraband,” the statement added.At least three people, who are suspected to be from Latur district in neighbouring Maharastra were arrested. The law enforcement authorities and other drug control agencies have been using one seizure to get information on more such operations to dismantle a large web of networks. “This operation was developed out of earlier operations, wherein seizure of a total quantity of 3,992 kg of ganja was affected resulting in the arrest of 16 persons and subsequent busting of 3 separate ganja trafficking networks,” according to the statement.There is also an alleged “kingpin” for this particular consignment is based out of Maharashtra, the NCB said. The source of the contraband is the Andhra Pradesh and Odisha border.The narcotics detection agency said that these drugs are peddled in various colleges, parties, individuals and other places through an elaborate ground network.“During the year 2020, a total quantity of 1,971 kg of ganja was seized, resulting in the arrest of 8 persons. This year, by the end of August 2021, a total quantity of over 7500 kg ganja have already been seized by the NCB, Bengaluru zone, resulting in the arrest of 25 persons. The two enforcement actions of the NCB and recent substantial seizures of ganja clearly indicate that the ganja traffickers have been desperate and taking the risk of carrying maximum quantity of the contraband at a time,” the agency statement noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-seizes-marijuana-worth-21-crore-3-held-101630262381293.html
30-08-2021||India||US strikes ‘suicide bombers’, says more attacks imminent||A US drone strike Sunday blew up a vehicle carrying “multiple suicide bombers” from Afghanistan’s Islamic State affiliate before they could target the ongoing military evacuation at Kabul’s international airport as Taliban guards stood outside, American officials said. The strike came just two days before the US is set to conclude a massive airlift of tens of thousands of Afghan and foreign civilians and withdraw the last of its troops, ending America’s longest war, with the Taliban back in power.At around the same time as the drone strike, Afghan police said a rocket hit a neighbourhood near the airport, killing a child. Rashid, the Kabul police chief, who goes by one name, confirmed the rocket attack, and video obtained by The Associated Press showed smoke rising from a building around a kilometre from the airport.The Taliban described the drone strike and the rocket attack as separate incidents, but residents of the Afghan capital heard only one large blast.One US official said the strike was carried out by an unmanned aircraft piloted from outside Afghanistan, and that secondary explosions following the strike showed the target had been carrying a substantial amount of explosives. Television footage showed black smoke rising into the sky.The drone strike took place while remaining civilians waited at the airport to be flown out before the last troops leave, a Western security official said. A US official said on Saturday that fewer than 4,000 troops remained.After an Islamic State affiliate’s suicide attack that killed over 180 people on Thursday, US President Joe Biden had vowed to keep up the airstrikes, saying earlier on Saturday that another attack was “highly likely”. The State Department called the threat “specific” and “credible”. The Taliban too increased its security around the airfield as several Western nations wrapped up evacuations. Two American military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations, called the airstrike successful and said the vehicle carried multiple bombers.US Navy Capt Bill Urban, a spokesperson for the American military’s Central Command, called the drone strike an action taken in “self-defence”. He said authorities continued “assessing the possibilities of civilian casualties, though we have no indications at this time.”“We are confident we successfully hit the target,” Urban said. “Significant secondary explosions from the vehicle indicated the presence of a substantial amount of explosive material.”Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid earlier said in a message to journalists that the US strike targeted a suicide bomber as he drove a vehicle loaded with explosives. Mujahid offered few other details.The strike was the second by America since the airport suicide bombing. On Saturday, a strike in Nangarhar province killed an Islamic State member believed to be involved in planning attacks against the United States in Kabul.The Sunni extremists of IS, with links to the group’s more well-known affiliate in Syria and Iraq, have carried out a series of brutal attacks, mainly targeting Afghanistan’s Shia Muslim minority, including a 2020 assault on a maternity hospital in Kabul in which they killed women and infants.The Taliban have fought against Islamic State militants in Afghanistan, where the Taliban have wrested back control nearly 20 years after they were ousted in a US-led invasion. The Americans went in following the 9/11 attacks, which al-Qaeda orchestrated while being sheltered by the group.US military cargo planes continued their runs into the airport Sunday, ahead of a Tuesday deadline earlier set by President Joe Biden to withdraw all troops. However, Afghans remaining behind in the country worry about the Taliban reverting to their earlier oppressive rule — something fuelled by the recent shooting death of a folk singer in the country by the militants.A Taliban official said the Islamist group had engineers and technicians ready to take charge of the airport after US troops depart.ADMINISTRATION CRISIS The US-backed Afghan government’s collapse as Taliban forces advanced towards Kabul earlier this month leaves an administrative vacuum that has led to fears of an economic crisis and widespread hunger.Prices for commodities like flour, oil and rice are rapidly rising and the currency is plunging, with money changers across the border in Pakistan already refusing to accept the afghani.On Saturday, officials ordered banks to reopen and imposed a limit on withdrawals of $200 or 20,000 afghani. Long queues forming outside bank branches of people trying to get money out.Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid has said the difficulties will subside quickly once the new administration is up and running. But with its economy shattered by decades of war, Afghanistan is now facing the end of billions of dollars in foreign aid poured in by Western donors.Mujahid said the Taliban would announce a full cabinet in the coming days. It had appointed governors and police chiefs in all but one of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces, he said.The Taliban also appealed to the United States and other Western nations to maintain diplomatic relations after withdrawing. Britain said that should happen only if the Taliban allow safe passage for those who want to leave and respect human rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-strikes-suicide-bombers-says-more-attacks-imminent-101630262082650.html
30-08-2021||India||Sting video exposes internal rifts in BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit||The sexual video sting tape controversy engulfing the Bharatiya Janata Party in Tamil Nadu has exposed fissures between the new entrants and the old guard of the national party. On Thursday, when ousted party worker Madan Ravichandran released audiotapes of purported conversations between him and state president K. Annamalai, the issue escalated, with calls of factionalism within the party and senior leaders’ criticism on how they dealt with the issue, also coming to the fore.The rumblings began last Tuesday when YouTuber Madan Ravichandran, who joined the party last year, released the video of general secretary KT Raghavan. Calling it a sting operation, Ravichandran said that he had gathered similar evidence against 15 others and that new president Annamalai allowed him to release the video. Almost immediately, Raghavan resigned from his post though he denied the allegations and decided to face it legally. Annamalai’s clarification also came quickly, confirming that Ravichandran discussed this issue with him, but he had not submitted the video as evidence for it to be probed. BJP also immediately formed an internal committee to probe allegations of sexual misconduct against Raghavan. On the following day, BJP fired Ravichandran. Upset over the developments, he then targeted the new BJP chief by releasing recorded audio conversations between them where Annamalai purportedly is discussing different options of dealing with this issue. One of the options was to engage the leadership in Delhi. Soon hashtags #isupportAnnamalai cropped up on social media, and BJP women leaders began posting videos and tweets defending that the party empowers women. There is talk about whether this was orchestrated internally due to the factionalism between those backed by the Sangh Parivar, between leaders of Brahmin and other communities. Party members are also wondering if other political parties in the state planted people like Ravichandran. Both Ravichandran and former IPS officer Annamalai joined the party only last year. Both are in their 30s, and the BJP celebrated them as the young voices to take on the Dravidian parties. “The basic problem is undue attention was given to newcomers,” said a state BJP leader who has been in the party for more than two decades and didn’t wish to be identified. “And all the leaders who have worked for the party all these years have been sidelined. And the new leaders have been promoting their communities.”The BJP is an anomaly in Tamil Nadu when compared to the rest of the country. The national party, which was barely a factor in Tamil Nadu, came into the spotlight only last year with their Vetrivel Yatra and protests on an issue on the Manusmriti. After 20 years, the party entered the assembly winning four seats. For this, the ex BJP president L Murugan had gone on a recruiting spree with several politicians jumping ship. “People like them don’t understand Hindutva. They’re opportunists,” said the leader quoted above. Murugan belonging to the Scheduled Caste community and his predecessor Tamilisai Soundararajan belonging to the Nadar community was the party’s efforts to shed its image of being a party of Hindi speaking upper castes.Murugan was rewarded for the party’s performance by being made a Union minister of state and paving the way for Annamalai to become chief in July. Annamalai grew quickly within the party given his close association with BJP national secretary B L Santosh which ensured he had support from the top leadership. He was given a ticket to contest in the recently concluded elections, but he was unsuccessful.Another leader said that the issue should have been dealt with without allowing it to become public. “Will such an incident in the DMK or AIADMK ever come out?” he asked. The scandal comes in the shadow of the BJP issuing a legal notice to Tamil daily over an article that claimed the party had allegedly received several complaints of sexual harassment against its leaders.Senior leaders continue to deny the article as well as recent events. “There is no factionalism in the BJP,” said a national leader not wishing to be named. “We need to check the background of Ravichandran. And an inquiry has been initiated against Raghavan.” He added that Annamalai and the state leadership had the issue under control and that they have not received any complaints of sexual harassment from women in their party.EXPERT/OPPN QUOTE||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sting-video-exposes-internal-rifts-in-bjp-s-tamil-nadu-unit-101630261962542.html

The state also reported 75 deaths in last 24 hours taking the toll to 20,541, as per the data released by the health ministry.The number of patients requiring ventilator support also rose from 883 to 915 on Sunday with many hospitals saying that there is a considerable hike in daily hospital admission. Total hospitalisation with moderate or severe Covid-19 symptoms crossed 31,000 on Sunday while on Saturday it was 29,523. Active cases also rose to 212, 566 on Sunday from 2,04,086. At least four districts reported more than 3,000 cases on Sunday. While Thrissur logged 3,965 new cases, Kozhikode recorded 3,548, Malappuram reported 3,195 and Ernakulam 3,178. As cases continue to surge, the state government has called a meeting of experts on Wednesday and another meeting with local body heads next Friday. In last five days, Kerala has reported more 150,000 cases with daily contribution of more than 65 per cent in the country’s overall tally. The country on Sunday recorded 45,083 new infections with a TPR of 3 per cent.Despite spiralling cases CM Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday painted a rosy picture citing high vaccination rate (74 % vaccinated) and low mortality rate of 0.5% against the national average of 1.34 per cent. The Centre had even given a strong warning to the state to ramp up its containment measures and increase testing. Despite wide criticism, the state government is yet to increase its RT-PCR tests. While neigbhouriing Tamil Nadu conducted 1,63, 230 tests on Friday, Karnataka conducted 1,49, 393 while Kerala saw only 73,138 tests. Many experts even have asked the state to shed its soft corner for conducting antigen tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-surge-rages-on-despite-curbs-in-kerala-101630261961198.html
30-08-2021||India||Talks on theatre commands making progress: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said discussions on the creation of joint commands and their implementation were progressing well and fast, indicating that differences between stakeholders on the theaterisation model are being addressed and India is on course to set up theatre commands.“With the creation of theatre commands, the Indian armed forces will have to develop integrated operational concepts and doctrine for joint war-fighting,” Singh said. His comments came during a talk on Defence Reforms in Shifting National Security Paradigm at the Defence Services Staff College in Wellington, Tamil Nadu.Last month, Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria flagged concerns about the theaterisation model, arguing that it was critical to first get the structure right, even as chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat gave out details of the plan to achieve jointness and brushed aside the reservations.The government had in June formed an eight-member panel under Rawat to fine-tune the theaterisation plans and bring all stakeholders on board, especially IAF, for speedy roll-out of new joint structures.Singh said the creation of the post of CDS and the department of military affairs was an important step to start defence reforms. “These steps have given the necessary direction for further changes and provided a system of coordination under which we are continuously taking our efforts forward,” he said.The armed forces currently have 17 single-service commands spread across the country. The Indian Army and the Indian Air Force have seven commands each, while the Indian Navy has three. Creating theatres would involve merging the existing commands (except the Udhampur-based Northern Command).The defence minister also talked about the challenges posed by the situation in Afghanistan, which had driven all countries to rethink their strategy. “The Quad (a group consisting of India, the US, Australia and Japan) has been constituted keeping these things in mind,” he said. Last week, CDS said India was concerned about terrorist activity in Afghanistan spilling over into the country after the Taliban takeover and contingency plans were in place to deal with the scenario.Singh also touched on the border row with China in the Ladakh sector. He said a unilateral attempt was made to change the status quo on the border last year, but India faced its adversary with a new dynamism rather than the old response.The two countries are currently in talks to reduce border tensions by disengaging front-line troops from all flashpoints along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC). Disengagement has been completed in the Pangong Tso sector and Gogra or Patrol Point-17A. However, problems at Hot Springs and Depsang are yet to be resolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talks-on-theatre-commands-making-progress-rajnath-101630261481978.html

That happened at Goalpara yesterday. Goalpara police had to chase criminals across the area of four police stations while being shot at. But finally, police got better of them,” director general of police, Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta tweeted.“Two of the dacoits, Rafajuddin and Basit Ali, died in the shootout while one Rashidul Islam has been injured. All of them have prior cases of dacoity against them. We recovered one gun and the car they were travelling,” he added.With Saturday’s incident, the number of those killed in such encounters rose to 22. At least 34 others have been injured in such incidents across the state.While opposition parties have accused the police of being ‘trigger-happy’, chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who handles the home portfolio, has urged police not to shy away from firing back at criminals while remaining within the ambit of the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-dacoits-gunned-downin-assam-encounter-cops-101630261300597.html
30-08-2021||India||MHA think tank suggests two new models of beat patrolling||Union home ministry’s think-tank, Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD), has recommended two new models of beat patrolling to the Union home ministry for urban and non-urban areas to improve policing at the grass-root level and strengthen police-public relation, which is marred by distrust. It has also recommended giving powers to the constables to investigate cognizable offences so that they can probe simple cases.The recommendations were made in a report submitted by the BPRD to the MHA. It suggested that police station areas in urban centres should be divided into 3 to 5 large beats with 3-4 constables or head constables allotted to each beat. It said the size of the beat and number of beat officers allotted should depend on the crime and law and order requirements of that particular area and it should be marked in a way that a beat officer should be able to cover the entire beat in about an hour on foot. The BPRD also said in the report that these beat officers shall not normally be allotted any other work, except during major law and order disturbances, disaster management requirements, VVIP visits and elections.“They shall adjust their work in such a manner that at least one of them will be available in the beat discharging beat related work all the time,” the report, reviewed by HT, stated. For non-urban areas, the BPRD has recommended dividing a police station area into 15-20 or more beats with one constable/head constable deputed to each beat. “Ideally, there should be one beat for each ward/panchayat,” BPRD said.“The beat officers allotted to each non-urban area beat shall be responsible for all the policing functions. They shall take the assistance of the village guards/chowkidars.. Beat officers of neighbouring beats may be appointed as the ‘link officers’ for the other’s beat during the periods of the long absence of the beat officer,” the report stated. “The state government(s) may consider giving powers of investigation to constables by amending the Police Rules wherever they do not allow an investigation by constables,”it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-think-tank-suggests-two-new-models-of-beat-patrolling-101630261241489.html

Sanskrit literature comprises the divine philosophy of humanity and knowledge which can captivate anyone’s attention.”He also drew the country’s attention to the popularity that Sanskrit enjoys across the world.“It is taught across the world from Ireland to Thailand, from Russia to Sydney.”“Sanskrit language also plays an important role in the strengthening of cultural relations between India and Ireland and between India and Thailand here in the east. Dr Chirapat Prapandavidya and Dr Kusuma Rakshamani, both of them are playing a very important role in the promotion of the Sanskrit language in Thailand... Another such professor is Shriman Boris Zakharin, who teaches Sanskrit at Moscow State University in Russia...,” stated Prime Minister.“It is our collective duty to cherish our heritage, preserve it, pass it on to the new generation.... and future generations also have a right to it...”Commemorating the 116th birth anniversary of legendary Hockey player Major Dhyanchand, which is celebrated as national sports day, the PM said: “We may win many laurels, but the nation has always craved for a win in Hockey. Major Dhyanchand showed us the way, now we must continue to progress.”The PM also highlighted the forays made by young Indian entrepreneurs in the field of space. “There are so many college, university students and those in the private sector who are laying the foundation for the new developments in space that will take place in the future.”Drawing attention to India’s growing startup ecosystem, Modi said that the youngsters of today aren’t and should not be afraid to take risks. “Just a little while ago, we were talking about India’s stake in the toy market, now so many young entrepreneurs are working to innovate in the field.” He also urged the country to continuously maintain its commitment to the Swacchh Bharat, or Clean India campaign and appreciated Indore and Sivaganga’s (Tamil Nadu) contribution to the same.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-mann-ki-baat-modi-urges-people-to-cherish-and-preserve-sanskrit-101630260706557.html

HT has reviewed a copy of the tender.The move comes in the backdrop of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day announcement on rolling out 75 new Vande Bharat Express trains that will be launched to connect different parts of the country in 75 weeks to mark the ongoing “Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav”. These trains will be manufactured at the Integral Coach Factory, Chennai; Modern Coach Factory, Rae Bareilly; and Rail Coach Factory, Kapurthala.The closing date for the tender is October 20, 2021. A pre-bid meeting will be held on September 21, with cut-off date for submission of pre-bid queries on September 14, an official said, asking not to be named.The tender, floated on August 28, invited bids for the design, development, manufacture, integration and testing of traction propulsion electrics for the manufacture of 58 rakes of Vande Bharat trains.The Railways in September last year floated a revised tender for procuring 44 semi-high speed Vande Bharat trains mandating 75% domestic components, making it a domestic tender. HT on August 20 reported the next lot of Vande Bharat rakes with upgraded amenities as well as better seating, security, and surveillance systems is expected to be commercially available from June 2022 onwards. “The first prototype rake is tentatively planned to be dispatched in March 2022, which will be put to commercial service tentatively by June 2022,” another senior official said.Some of the new amenities and safety features planned to be added include four emergency windows for easy evacuation of passengers; disaster lights in all coaches, to be used in the event of failure of all other lights in a disaster situation; and more emergency push buttons (four per coach).The coaches will also have a centralised coach monitoring system for all electrical, climate control, and other vital functions. An important upgrade in the new coaches will be a “pushback arrangement” for better reclining of seats. In the first two rakes of the Vande Bharat trains, issues regarding the seating comfort level were raised.PM Modi flagged off the maiden run of a Vande Bharat train on the New Delhi-Varanasi route on February 15, 2019. The second such train service between New Delhi and Shri Mata Vaishnodevi Katra was flagged off by Union home minister Amit Shah on October 3 that year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-floats-a-tender-for-58-new-vande-bharat-trains-101630260581154.html

Two more have been rescued but their condition is critical,” the official added.The overall flood situation in the Kaziranga National Park (KNP) was also turning critical with around 50% of the area already under water, its director P Sivakumar said. Animals have started crossing the National Highway 37 that runs through the Park in search of dry land and one hog deer was killed in the act on Saturday, he said.State disaster management authority officials were hopeful that the condition would improve in the coming days.“The water levels of major rivers are showing a receding trend and there’s no alert for more heavy rainfall in the next few days. Hopefully, the situation will improve rapidly soon. Thankfully, there have been no human deaths reported across the state thus far,” said Dhiraj Saud, state project coordinator, ASDMA||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-250k-hit-6-200-displaced-as-floods-ravage-assam-districts-101630260522432.html
30-08-2021||India||Want good India-Afghanistan relations, says Taliban leader||Taliban leader Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai has said the group wants to continue Afghanistan’s political, economic and cultural ties with India, the first time a member of the Taliban’s top hierarchy has spoken on the issue since the takeover of Kabul.In a nearly 46-minute video posted on the Taliban’s social media platforms on Saturday, Stanekzai spoke extensively in Pashto on the end of the war in Afghanistan and the Taliban’s plans for forming an Islamic administration based on Shariah. He also spoke about the Taliban’s views on relations with key countries in the region, including India, Pakistan, China and Russia.Since the Taliban assumed power in Kabul after the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government on August 15, the group’s spokesmen Suhail Shaheen and Zabiullah Mujahid have spoken to Pakistani media about the group’s views on relations with India. However, Stanekzai is the first senior leader to make a statement on relations with other countries. “India is very important for this subcontinent. We want to continue our cultural, economic and trade ties with India like in the past,” he said.“Trade with India through Pakistan is very important for us. With India, trade through air corridors will also remain open,” he said, outlining the Taliban’s plans for trade in the region.However, he didn’t say whether trade via India should be two-way. Pakistan has allowed Afghan traders to ship their goods to India through its territory but has never permitted Indian goods to be transported via Pakistani soil to Afghanistan.“We give due importance to our political, economic and trade ties with India and we want these ties to continue. We are looking forward to working with India in this regard,” Stanekzai added.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Stanekzai’s remarks, which were widely shared on social media.While speaking about Afghanistan’s relations with Turkmenistan, Stanekzai mentioned the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline project and said the Taliban would work to address the problems holding up the venture once a government is formed. Stanekzai also referred to the Chabahar port developed by India while speaking about relations with Iran and highlighted its importance for trade.He also spoke about relations with China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Russia. He thanked Pakistan for hosting millions of Afghan refugees and said Afghanistan wants to have brotherly relations with Pakistan.As reported by HT, Stanekzai had informally reached out to the Indian side after the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made a surprise request for New Delhi to retain its diplomatic presence in Kabul. He had also referred to reports that fighters from Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) were in Kabul and deployed at check posts on routes to the airport, and contended that all check posts, including those at the airport, were firmly in the hands of the Taliban.However, the Indian side concluded Stanekzai’s message couldn’t be taken at face value and went ahead with plans to pull out nearly 200 diplomats, officials and security personnel, including the ambassador, from Kabul.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that it was uncertain whether Stanekzai’s remarks were made in a personal capacity or represented the thinking of the Taliban’s top leadership. They come at a time when there are reports of differences among various factions of the group over issues such as the formation of the next set-up and appointments to key positions.The people also said the remarks could be part of efforts to seek legitimacy for the Taliban and attain some sort of autonomy from Pakistan, which has considerable influence on the group’s leadership. However, the people also noted that Stanekzai’s remarks had not addressed India’s security concerns, including the presence of Pakistan-based terror groups on Afghan soil.Stanekzai, who is seen as the number two in the Taliban’s negotiating team and third overall among leaders based in Qatar, trained for several years at the Indian Military Academy (IMA) in Dehradun in the early 1980s. The people cited above said he appeared to be taking on a key role in foreign relations though he has not been fully involved in recent decision-making in Kabul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/want-good-india-afghanistan-relations-says-taliban-leader-101630260163407.html
30-08-2021||India||BJP banks on Pushkar Singh Dhami to lead 2022 Uttarakhand poll battle||In Uttarakhand, where it faces anti-incumbency and a slew of charges from mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic to the failure in compensating for job losses, the Bharatiya Janata Party is banking on chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami to address doubts about governance deficit and leadership crisis ahead of the 2022 assembly polls.The party is also hoping that with Dhami now in the saddle, the attention that the party drew for playing musical chairs with the chief ministers, which hinted at political instability, will be diverted. In March, the party replaced Trivendra Singh Rawat, who was in office for four years, with Tirath Singh Rawat who in turn was replaced after four months in office by Dhami who took oath in July.According to senior party leaders, following a recent round of meetings between the state and national leadership of the BJP chaired by party president JP Nadda, the CM was asked to sort out with speed governance issues in the last phase of the BJP’s five-year tenure.The state government has been asked to address concerns about job losses, listen to the demand for land laws that restrict the purchase of land to locals, and mitigate public anger about construction activities in the ecologically sensitive region, particularly the Char Dham road project.“Because of the hilly terrain and the limited avenues for employment generation in the state, jobs is always a key concern in the elections. However, this time because of the pandemic there has been severe job losses. Tourism has been affected and an overall slump in the economy has deepened the crisis. In such a scenario, people expect the government to step in and create more jobs,” said a state BJP functionary.The party is hopeful that Dhami’s announcement promising 22,000 jobs in various government departments, increasing the salaries of government teachers and resumption of jobs on contract basis will shore up the party’s fortunes. “Even though the appointments will take about five to six months since the service commission has to be roped in, it will subside the anger to a large extent,” the leader quoted above said.Another issue that has been simmering in the state that the CM has been asked to tackle right away is the issue of temple management through the Devasthanam Board.The new management model envisaged by Dhami’s predecessor Trivendra Singh Rawat was met with protest in the hill state and was given as a reason for his removal. While the government argued that the board was formed to administer and manage the properties of the temples including the four major centres of pilgrimage — Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri — the priests led a stir against it and still want it to be scrapped. The issue is also likely to figure prominently in the elections early next year.Earlier this week, Dhami had an hour-long meeting with a group of priests to assure them that the Devasthanam Board that was created in 2019 to serve as a management board for 51 temples in the state would not impinge on their rights.“Unlike his predecessors (Trivendra Singh) who had rubbed people the wrong way, Dhami is young and possesses the quality of taking people along. He listens and reaches out, a quality that helps in keeping the party flock together,” said a second leader based in Delhi on condition of anonymity.The leader, however, admitted that the party will have to think on its feet to counter the public perception about governance issues as the opposition has been quick to raise issues ranging from land laws to employment.With AAP throwing its hat in the ring and promising subsidised amenities as it does in Delhi, the BJP is being forced to come up with matching incentives and ingenuity to counter the promised sops. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has promised up to 300 units of free electricity per month to every family in Uttarakhand and free electricity to the farmers.The Congress, for its part, has stated that it will quash the amendments made to the Uttarakhand (Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reform Act, 1950) Amendment Act, 2018, that did away with a 12-acre ceiling on purchase of agricultural land for industrial purposes. Former CM Harish Rawat, too, has been vocal about the need for laws restricting the sale and purchase of land to locals.The BJP is also expecting the spate of landslides to snowball into a poll issue. As per details by the Uttarakhand government, there have been over 100 landslides in 2021 alone leading to loss of life and property.With environmentalists and common people alike blaming the construction of the 5.5 metre wide Char Dham road for deterioration of the local ecology, the party is on the defensive, claiming that it was necessary from the point of view of national security and development of the region.Even the Supreme Court in 2020 had directed the state government to limit the road width to 5.5m as against 10m proposed initially. “When flash floods on the Dhauliganga river occurred in February, many people blamed the construction activities in the state. More trees were cut than what was permitted and in the past year, there has been loss of life due to frequent landslides. Since people are concerned about the fragile ecology of the state that has harmed the economy as well, this issue will dominate the political discourse,” said MM Semwal of the HNB Garhwal Central University.Commenting on whether Dhami’s appointment can change the party’s fortunes, he said the BJP’s campaign has pivoted around Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s image and central schemes, but as the polls draw near, the people will demand to know what plans the BJP has for them.“The Congress, the AAP and the BJP are all competing for the Hindutva agenda. AAP, for instance, said it wants to turn Dehradun into an adhyatmik or spiritual capital; the Congress says Hindutva is not BJP’s monopoly. But given the high literacy rate of the state, people will demand to know what plans they have for economic revival, job creation and improving the healthcare infrastructure in the state,” Semwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-banks-on-dhami-to-lead-2022-uttarakhand-poll-battle-101630254880258.html

Necessary notification to this effect shall be issued shortly, it added.CBDT clarified that there is no proposal to change the last date of payment with “additional” amount, which remains October 31, 2021.The scheme, which was enacted on March 17, 2020, closed on March 31 this year. However, taxpayers who have already made declaration within the stipulated deadline of March 31 could make payment without any additional amount or penalty up to September 30, 2021. As per the previous notification dated June 25, the last date of payment of the settled amount without any additional charge was August 31, and with additional amount was October 31, 2021.The Vivad se Vishwas scheme provides for settlement of disputed tax, disputed interest, disputed penalty or disputed fees in relation to an assessment or reassessment order. It grants immunity to taxpayers from levy of interest, penalty and institution of any proceeding for prosecution for any offence under the Income-Tax Act in respect of matters covered in the declaration.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the scheme in the Union Budget presented on February 1, 2020. It aimed to resolve legacy disputes involving direct taxes. Under the scheme, penalty and interest would be waived if the disputed amount is paid before the stipulated date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deadline-for-payment-under-tax-dispute-resolution-scheme-extended-to-sept-30-101630232200095.html
30-08-2021||Today's||To Saleem Kidwai: A letter to a friendship||I never thought I’d be writing this to you. I didn’t think our friendship would get cut off so brutally and without any warning. From so far away all I can do is write this letter to you. When you came down to New York to meet me in 1975 from your time at the Islamic Institute at McGill University, Montréal, we instantly recognised that we were gay but of quite different flavours. You are very shy and reticent about joining the gay scene whereas I was already out and loud and proud. I was determined that you should join me in our liberating quest. It seemed at the time that we were the only two out gay men of Indian origin that we knew.Also Read: Historian, queer rights activist Saleem Kidwai dies in LucknowYou went back to teach history at Delhi University, and I didn’t manage to visit you till 1980. We became very close as you helped me in my quest to visualise Indian gay men. After five years of British art schooling, I had not been able to find any mention of them and it had become my overarching goal to locate them in the canons of art history. You were my informant and also my muse and appeared in my earliest pictures at a time when nobody else would. Together we cruised the parks and parties of gay Delhi hoping to meet like-minded men in search of gay liberation. We talked a lot about where one could live as a gay man at that time, and you opted to live in India and make a difference while I found it impossible to go back and live in the closet. We exchanged letters and postcards and occasional phone calls and sometimes even managed to meet in person in London or in Delhi. Then in the 1990s you began to research the work of excavating the hidden history of same-sex love in India along with Ruth Vanita, a fellow scholar at Delhi University at the time. The resulting book, Same Sex Love in India: Readings from Literature and History, became a vanguard for South Asian queer studies in academia around the world.In Photos: Artist Sunil Gupta remembers historian & activist Saleem KidwaiIt also became the historical backbone of the movement to overturn Section 377, the law that criminalized homosexuality in India. I returned to Delhi in the early 2000s when you helped me make a video on AIDS for the University of Southampton in the UK, about the local situation. You put me in touch with the Lawyers Collective, and the local queer community in Delhi, and helped make what eventually became “A World Without Pity”.The scene was changing rapidly, and you encouraged me to return to live in Delhi and [you would stay with me when you visited the city where you taught for over 20 years]. By now, you had established yourself back in Lucknow, where you had gone to make a base for your academic research work away from the social hubbub of Delhi. There, you translated several books from Urdu to English. I made a book too, “Pictures. From Here” and we exchanged them. Making books became another thing that brought us together. In 2009 we were proved wrong that we would never see the anti-gay law changed in India in our lifetime. We celebrated and we partied, and we had a great flat to do that in. We were both single and you revelled in that: you were quite happy to be single and gay. I had a number of disastrous but entertaining internet dates that you were witness to. But then you were also witness to my meeting the man who would become my husband eventually. This led to more conversations about whether queer people should get married or not, whether I had sold out the old gay liberation politics. It became difficult to live as a married and gay man in Delhi, so I returned to London, and you returned to your books in Lucknow. You, of course, remained a champion of our original gay politics that critiqued the accumulation of capital and hetero-normative family life as the source of patriarchal oppression in India.We had to make do with fleeting annual visits to see each other. I would keep turning up with the latest photo book I had made, and you had proudly given me a whole shelf to fill. Just the other day, we spoke about how I would soon be on my way to meet you clutching my latest book to add to your shelf. But now that will never be as I woke up this morning to the sound of my phone pinging endlessly to the messages from India announcing the news of your passing. You broke my heart my friend by leaving me so soon, but I will love you forever.(Sunil Gupta is a photographer based in London. He is the author of ‘Pictures.

30-08-2021||Today's||Asset monetisation holds the key to value creation in infrastructure||Top-quality, well-managed infrastructure lies at the heart of economic growth. With Covid-19 taking an unprecedented toll on economic activity, a significantly enhanced level of infrastructure investment is required to revive growth. Financing requires a diversified set of alternatives.In this context, asset recycling and monetisation serve two critical objectives — it unlocks value from public investment in infrastructure, and it taps private sector efficiencies in operations and management. Asset monetisation is a shift from privatisation and slump sale of assets to structured partnerships with private sector within contractual frameworks. It is not just a funding mechanism, but a paradigm shift in infrastructure operations, augmentation and maintenance.India has made massive strides in creating a mesh of infrastructure in recent years. For most sectors, this has been driven by public funding. Today, India holds one of the largest brownfield stocks of fixed assets in the world. However, while the public sector can build infrastructure, it is rarely able to run it efficiently. The private sector has much greater resource efficiencies in developing and managing infrastructure. Increasingly, therefore, the government looks to partner with the private sector. However, for effective co-working, public private partnership (PPP) models now need a reboot.Also Read | Expedite matters related to aviation infrastructure: Scindia to five CMsIndia has a robust PPP ecosystem. Concepts such as preservation of ownership with government, transfer back of assets at the end of concession and key performance indicators are ingrained in our PPP ecosystem. However, there has been reduced appetite among private sector and debt financiers for greenfield infrastructure. This necessitates innovative mechanisms, structured around mature brownfield assets, for tapping private investment. Asset monetisation, therefore, strives to tilt the axis from greenfield to brownfield models.The increased appetite for brownfield assets is evidenced by the flow of private and institutional capital into sectors such as roads, power and telecom. The private sector has utilised risk-managed structures to monetise assets such as toll roads, transmission towers, pipelines and telecom towers, thus bringing in a new investor class into India’s infrastructure. From the public sector, National Highways Authority of India has monetised close to 1,400 km of toll roads through Toll-Operate-Transfer (TOT) concessions and has raised ₹17,000 crore. PowerGrid successfully launched the first ever public sector Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvIT), monetising its first batch of transmission assets and raising ₹7,700 crore. Airports Authority of India (AAI) successfully monetised six brownfield AAI airports through Operation Management and Development Agreement (OMDA) model raising upfront proceeds and private investment towards augmentation of the airports. Indian Railways also launched a strategic foray into PPP in station redevelopment and running of passenger trains.Innovative structured vehicles such as InvITs and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are capital market plays. They are created and operated under the regulatory framework of Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and target pooled long-term capital. Since the launch of regulations for these vehicles by SEBI in 2014, India’s private sector has effectively unlocked its invested equity by employing these vehicles and bringing in capital from global pension and sovereign funds. Assets Under Management (AUM) of ₹1 lakh crore from the private sector alone, is held by these vehicles.Through the asset monetisation programme, public sector entities will also tap into long-term institutional capital and build on the recent success of PowerGrid’s InvIT. More importantly, India’s public can also invest in InvITs and REITs as retail investors. These models interest a different investor class, comprising global pension and sovereign wealth funds and also retail investors. SEBI regulations bring transparency for investors and also efficiency in asset management.India’s tryst with monetisation is not a new thing, but an ongoing exercise. There is now a need to systematically adopt these initiatives across varied asset classes and streamline frameworks and modalities of such alternatives in a manner that can be readily absorbed, evaluated and replicated.The availability of a sustained and robust asset pipeline has been cited as a key concern by investors at various forums. A well-laid-out pipeline gives a comprehensive view to investors and developers of brownfield investment avenues in infrastructure and helps them plan their fundraising and due diligence activities.An initiative such as National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) is pathbreaking at many levels. Creating a sectorally diverse pipeline beyond the traditional sectors of roads and power necessitated a “whole of government” exercise with a comprehensive scanning of brownfield asset inventory. A diverse and sustained NMP not only provides visibility to investors on potential financing opportunities but also in driving preparedness of public authorities to structure and launch transactions in a systematic and transparent manner.The states are equal partners in India’s infrastructure story. India cannot grow faster unless the states grow at higher rates. The states too present a significant potential for leveraging assets such as tolled state highways, transmission towers, discoms, bus terminals, sports stadiums and state warehouses to mobilise capital for investment, which can have multiplier effects on state economies.Recognising the criticality of enhanced capital expenditure, the Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Expenditure is a pathbreaking measure. Under the scheme, an incentive is provided to the states in the form of 50-year interest-free loans.

Her mortal remains were greeted with “jai bhims and lal salaams” - salutations befitting the final journey of an anti-caste figure. Her public life — which was also her academic life — doesn’t have many parallels in mainstream Indian academy. One can compare her to Pierre Bourdieu, the French Marxist sociologist who stood with working people against the onslaught of neoliberalism in the 1990s. But even he fades in her company, considering the magnitude of Omvedt’s interventions on behalf of the oppressed majority in India. A bilingual activist-scholar who lived and wrote within the confines (and possibilities) of a middle-caste peasant household in rural Maharashtra, Omvedt stood away from the glitters of Delhi-centric academic practice. Her writings embodied a permanent protest site outside Indian sociology — always critical and satyashodhak (truth-seeking). In that sense, she liberated sociology (and history) from the tight knots of academic capitalism. Her life, as Bharat Patankar told Dalit Camera, was shaped by the progressive mobilisations of the 1960s United States (US) and later, the Karl Marx-Jyotirao Phule-Ambedkarite movements of Maharashtra. Omvedt was always in the midst of people’s collective actions. Her work was a yield, a possibility of such actions. It is all too easy to mystify her life by listing her personal achievements. But she wouldn’t have agreed to such heroic individualism.Also Read | Scholar, Ambedkarite movement activist Gail Omvedt dies at 81Omvedt was not simply a caste studies scholar, but a sociologist of anti-caste consciousness. She saw connections between such consciousness and the total emancipation of India. She was compassionate and identified a dignified place for the non-Brahmin, oppressed castes in the struggle for human liberation. Omvedt redefined India in a way that centred anti-caste thought. She questioned the taken-for-granted connections between religion and the masses. She underlined how a strong critique of religion (beyond Nehruvian secularism and Gandhian reform) always thrived in the Phule-Ambedkar-Periyar traditions of India. Through a detailed study of this tradition, she mobilised an anti-caste India, a begumpura. While professional sociologists approached the working masses as imposters, imitators or vote banks who are “easy” objects of academic gossip in urban institutional spaces, Omvedt explored their counter-hegemonic moves — always staying accountable to their questions. This was easy for her as she lived in their neighbourhood. While the doyens of Indian sociology, converted en masse into anti-reservation polemicists in the early 1990s, Omvedt saw them as actors in the “twice-born” revolt against the Mandal Commission. She argued that (Other Backward Classes) OBC reservation should be judged against its stated goal, ie, to end the caste monopoly of the twice-born in the public sector, and not anything else. She highlighted the need for a detailed caste census, an issue which remains unanswered, but is again in public discourse today. In her analysis of the land question in the context of caste, Omvedt questioned the theories which assign caste an “integrative and democratic” role. She always problematised the neat separation between caste and class, and argued that relations of production in the sub-continent cannot be understood without caste. Caste, according to her, was always a “material reality, with material base and economic results”. She emphasised that an anti-caste struggle is essentially a struggle against exploitative relations of productions. Omvedt approached Jotiba Phule as a radical intellectual who skillfully connected the questions of caste-gender exploitation with ecology and economy. Similarly, she made it a point to highlight the materialist thrust of Babasaheb’s (Ambedkar’s) social programme, including his decision to embrace Buddhism. In her interactions with the women’s movements, Omvedt tenaciously placed the poor working woman and her socio-economic struggles at the centre. Her writings serve as a socialist reminder. With increasing precarity and economic insecurity, her interventions are more relevant than ever. Though a neighbourhood sociologist of the rural masses, she never valorised rurality or glorified obscurantism. She was one with them yet maintained a rigorous, scientific distance in her writings. She pursued a “science which disturbed” and proved that seeking sanctuary in urban academe is not scientific detachment but more of arrogant elitism. From her room in Kasegoan, with her comrades by her side, she connected the struggles of the working poor across the globe. Her comparative studies on South Asia and beyond testify this succinctly. This universal focus, bring us to a question — what would it take to produce women academics in rural backgrounds? What kind of a world would allow peasant women to read and write not only about their own worlds, but about people everywhere, the way Omvedt could? We don’t have the answers. Yet, going back to Omvedt’s writings could serve as a starting point. She empathetically captured the drudgery of daily toil in the lives of the working people. Freeing oneself from this grind cannot be achieved without a total view of social and economic relations. This is a scientific pursuit par excellence. It requires irreverence and clarity of mind — facets so clearly visible in Gail Omvedt’s life.

30-08-2021||Today's||India is failing its Afghan friends||In March 1990, an Indian Air Force IL-76 took off from Trincomalee, in eastern Sri Lanka, en route to Mauritius. On board was Tamil leader V Perumal, the Northeast provincial council’s chief minister, along with his family and some 200 supporters, among India’s closest allies on the island.Perumal’s organisation, the Eelam People’s Revolutionary Liberation Front, had paid a bloody price for standing by India’s peacekeeping mission. So when India withdrew in defeat, it evacuated him as well as well as thousands of other threatened Sri Lankan Tamils. This was not merely about moral principle, but also out of interest to protect its assets and keep leverage over Sri Lanka.Now fast forward to the fall of Kabul, in Afghanistan. While India’s intervention was different, the challenge to stand by its Afghan friends is similar. Beyond just evacuating its own citizens and the Afghan Hindu and Sikh minorities, it was heartwarming to hear New Delhi swiftly promise to “stand by” its Afghan partners. However, the hard reality of the past fortnight reflects India’s inability to protect thousands of Afghans who worked with India to fight the Taliban and other terror groups supported by Pakistan.Also Read | Afghan TV anchor relays Taliban message surrounded by armed fightersThe Opposition naturally criticised the government’s lack of willingness or ideological bias in keeping Afghans out of India. The truth, however, is more simple and tragic. Translating India’s commitment into practice failed because of the lack of preparation and systems, including a much-needed asylum policy.The hurried announcement of emergency visas, for example, has still not been properly implemented, mostly due to bureaucratic frictions. Only a few dozen Afghans have been evacuated so far. It may be soothing to hear that Afghans prefer to go to North America or Europe, but the sad reality is that many gave up on waiting for an Indian emergency visa that never came.In the absence of clear asylum and other guidelines during a crisis, ambiguity quickly turns into bureaucratic inertia and political discretion. The most glaring case came when India deported Afghan parliamentarian Rangina Kargar, after letting her wait for three hours at New Delhi airport. The fact that the government recognised the error and apologised to her only attests to the glaring shortcomings.The Afghan crisis reflects the absence of systems and capability to protect India’s local partners in active conflict zones. More than a moral issue, this failure is also a strategic liability.First, in the short-term, many hundreds of these Afghans may be in possession of sensitive information about India, starting with officers who trained at Indian military institutions or worked with Indian authorities. Such people are likely to be the first to be interrogated or targeted, whether by the Taliban or other terror groups working closely with Pakistan. They are now under threat of being used and abused to turn against India.Second, in the long-term, by letting these Afghans down, what guarantee is India giving to other Afghans, in case India re-engages in the future? And what signal is New Delhi giving to potential partners in other conflict zones where India is engaged today and tomorrow? These people have alternatives and may think twice before working with India. This will cost India’s soft power and capability to operate in other countries.In Afghanistan, India chose a clear side and invested over a billion dollars to build a more inclusive, developed and democratic State that would be supportive of India’s regional interests. None of this would have been possible without Afghan partners. From Kabul to Kandahar, India deployed paramilitary forces that relied on locals for support and security.It’s a country where India ran five diplomatic missions that were bombed, killing not only Indian officials but also many Afghan staffers. India trained thousands of Afghan military and other officials to fight the Taliban and other Pakistan-backed terror organisations seeking to attack India. Afghan journalists, politicians and young leaders were supported by India to build a free media and vibrant women’s and minority movements.Nobody expects India to evacuate all of its Afghan partners. Nor do we know, yet, what India is doing behind the scenes for its political allies. But when even South Korea is able to evacuate hundreds of its Afghan partners, it shows that India must find ways to do better. That the United States and others largely failed to do this does not serve as an excuse for India’s own shortcomings. Relying on hopeful backchannels with the Taliban, waiting and watching to see whether it turns out more or less vicious and violent, is not a solution.Supporting Afghan friends, who stood by India through thick and thin, would have meant implementing a system to register local partners and establishing priority lists. It would have meant an emergency visa system in place before the crisis erupted. It would have meant pre-designated safe havens for assembly, local funds and maybe also forces for extrication. It would have meant not letting thousands of Afghan passports be at risk of being stolen at some outsourcing centre while the embassy evacuated. Finally, it would also have meant resources to host and support Afghan partners to settle in India or relocate elsewhere.The government will have to work more on all this before the next crisis erupts in the neighbourhood. Political commitment and bureaucratic notifications are no substitute for preparation, training and resources. For a regional power with global ambitions, India must ensure it has the capabilities to respond first and bring its allies to safety.Constantino Xavier is a research fellow at the Centre for Social and Economic Progress, New DelhiThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/india-is-failing-its-afghan-friends-101630319383715.html
30-08-2021||Editorials||With a climate action plan, Mumbai shows the way||Last week, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) launched the first Mumbai Climate Action Plan (MCAP). The city is part of the C40 Cities climate leadership network and the drafting of the plan, in collaboration with World Resources Institute India, is part of the C40 compliance process. The plan will focus on six areas — waste management, sustainable mobility, clean energy, urban floods and water management, urban green cover and biodiversity, and air quality. There is also a proposal to set up a climate cell within BMC for better understanding of climate needs of the city, and, more importantly, to ensure coordination among departments and the state environment ministry to properly roll-out MCAP.Also Read | Mumbai: BMC launches city’s 1st climate action planMumbai is one of the most vulnerable cities to the climate crisis-induced hazards such as sea-level rise, storm surge and urban flooding. These extreme weather events are only going to increase in the future. In fact, the Arabian Sea is becoming a cyclone hotspot like the Bay of Bengal due to increase in ocean temperature. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (2019) warned that economic losses due to extreme flooding in coastal cities will soar 166 times more by 2050, and Mumbai will be one of the worst hit. Floods in the city between 2005 and 2015 are estimated to have led to a loss of ₹14,000 crore.Even though cities such as Mumbai are affected by the climate crisis, they are also well-placed to plan their mitigation and adaptation strategies because they are centres of innovation. This advantage, along with strong political support and strong local governance, which Mumbai has shown by kickstarting the plan, can help it become a climate resilient city, and also provide a template for other Indian cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/with-a-climate-action-plan-mumbai-shows-the-way-101630327964034.html
30-08-2021||Editorials||Afghanistan: The significance of August 31||In history books, August 15 — the day the Taliban took over Kabul — will overshadow August 31 — the date set by United States (US) President Joe Biden for the final withdrawal of the US military presence in Afghanistan. But August 31 will have its own significance. This artificially imposed deadline was the key trigger for the Taliban’s military offensive in the final phase of the war. To be sure, the original sin, in February 2020, was agreeing to a peace pact that gave the Taliban strength and legitimacy without extracting any concessions. If the desperate scenes at the Hamid Karzai International Airport and a US drone attack that killed civilians symbolised all that was wrong with the US’s mismanaged exit, the boost to jihadi groups of all hues reflected the strategic and security threat that has been created. The US will never be able to live down the consequences of its Afghan misadventure.Also Read | India is failing its Afghan friendsFor two decades, India was able to take advantage of the US security umbrella. In this period, New Delhi did well — cementing people-to-people ties, investing in symbols of democracy, providing development aid, expanding its diplomatic presence, and staying away from establishing a military presence which could have antagonised the civilian population. Given India’s history with the Taliban and its backers in Pakistan and its commitment to democratic values, New Delhi backed the Afghan government till the very end, when there was no government to back anymore. It is now time to make alternative arrangements.The Taliban is making the right noises. Its senior leader, Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai, outlined India’s importance in the subcontinent, expressed a desire to continue cultural, economic and trade ties, and underlined the value of projects such as Chabahar. This is a signal that Taliban may be more autonomous from Pakistan in government than it was as an insurgent force, and provides an opening for engagement. But no one in Delhi is under any illusions. The Taliban is heterogenous; its ability or even desire to crack down on its friends — including terror groups targeting India — is in doubt; the rhetoric could well be tactical to earn legitimacy; and whether it can cross any Pakistani red lines on India remains to be seen. But Delhi now has no choice but to work with the Taliban, quietly for now and openly sooner rather than later, to secure its interests. While being alert to the threats emanating from its western neighbourhood, prepare for a new relationship with a different Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/afghanistan-the-significance-of-august-31-101630321783682.html
