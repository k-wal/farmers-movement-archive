27-08-2021||News||In Afghanistan, the ideology and evolution of the Islamic State-Khorasan||Six years after its expansion into Khorasan, the historic name for the area encompassing Afghanistan, Pakistan and parts of India, the Islamic State (IS) affiliate in Afghanistan has proved it continues to have the ability to carry out devastating terrorist assaults with the suicide attack at Kabul airport.The Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) claimed responsibility for the complex assault by a team of suicide attackers on a gate of the airport and a nearby hotel on Thursday that has so far killed nearly 100 people, including 13 American military personnel.The attack also proved the group has the capability to challenge the Taliban, which was being seen as the effective rulers of Afghanistan after their lightning blitz that carried them into the capital city on August 15.Since the beginning, the IS has had a complicated relationship with the Taliban, though both comprise Sunni Muslim fighters.The first man named as the head of the Khorasan unit in January 2015 was a breakaway Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) commander named Hafiz Saeed Khan. Around that time, several Pakistani Taliban leaders, including Shahidullah Shahid, Daulat Khan, Fateh Gul Zaman and Mufti Hassan, also pledged allegiance to IS.Also Read | Joe Biden has got it wrongMany of these commanders broke away from the Pakistani Taliban, which has close links with the Afghan Taliban, after the Pakistan Army launched a massive military operation against the TTP in the northwestern tribal regions. They fled across the border to Afghanistan’s eastern provinces and joined forces with the IS.IS-K also attracted commanders from Lashkar-e-Taiba, such as Aslam Farooqi alias Abdullah Orakzai, who became the affiliate’s chief in July 2019 and was captured in an operation by the National Directorate of Security and Afghan special forces in Kandahar in April 2020.The group often used the ploy of projecting a more hardline version of Islam to wean away disaffected fighters from the Taliban and other terror groups operating in Afghanistan. Besides Afghans and Pakistanis, the IS-K also attracted fighters from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Indonesia, Iran, Russia, the Maldives and India. It is believed dozens of men from Kerala and their families joined the group.Afghan officials, such as former spy chief Amrullah Saleh, have repeatedly contended that Pakistan had a hand in the creation of IS-K to carry out attacks in Afghanistan with an element of deniability.Over the past six years, the IS and the Taliban have clashed frequently, especially in the eastern provinces Kunar, Nangarhar and Nuristan provinces, where the IS established an early presence. More significantly, it was able to establish sleeper cells with Kabul that were used to carry out a string of deadly suicide attacks, mostly targeting the Shia Hazara minority.In November, some 600 IS-K fighters surrendered along with hundreds of family members in Nangarhar after a prolonged campaign by the Afghan security forces backed by US troops. At the time, reports had suggested the Taliban had helped government forces in squeezing out the IS fighters.The campaign showed that the IS-K was largely incapable of holding territory, unlike the Taliban. However, it still retained the ability to carry out brutal suicide attacks and bombings in cities across Afghanistan. It carried out six major attacks in Kabul in 2016, 18 in 2017, and 24 in 2018. In May this year, a suicide bombing outside a girls’ school in a Shia Hazara neighbourhood of Kabul killed 68 and injured nearly 170 more.The Taliban’s recent victory in Afghanistan was celebrated by al-Qaeda and other terror groups, with experts warning that the development would energise militants and extremists across South Asia and beyond.Also Read | The cost of crime and criminal justice in IndiaThe Global Islamic Media Front, an al-Qaeda linked news outlet, issued a “statement of congratulations” that noted the 20-year war had “ended with the Islamic Emirate triumphantly returning to Kabul, and the Americans and Afghan stooges hastily running away”. The statement also noted the Taliban’s victory was possible because of its “firmness on religious principles and its dedication to Shariah judgements”, a reference to the Taliban’s pledge to implement Islamic law in Afghanistan.The IS, on the other hand, was derisive in its response to the Taliban victory. An editorial in Arabic in its weekly newsletter al-Naba dismissed the conquest of Kabul as a takeover coordinated with the US in line with the peace deal signed by the two sides in Qatar in February 2020. The editorial said that after the Taliban pledged it would not repeat the mistakes of the past, the US “restored rule to the Taliban and granted it Kabul without firing a shot”.The editorial also espoused the “soundness of the path” adopted by the IS to establish Shariah, saying that “supporting Islam does not pass through the hotels of Qatar nor the embassies of Russia, China and Iran” – an obvious reference to the Taliban’s ongoing discussions with key regional powers.Experts now believe the IS-K will continue to challenge the Taliban as it tries to form the next administration in Kabul and takes steps to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the world community.Douglas London, a former senior CIA operations officer whose last position was serving as chief of counter-terrorism for South and Southwest Asia, told USA Today that said the threat posed by the IS-K is now higher because of the vacuum created by the Taliban takeover. It maintains its capabilities to launch deadly attacks, and “those are the reasons they and the Taliban are mortal enemies – because ISIS-K represents a competitor. They represent a competitor for resources, materials and power, even though they’re relatively small,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-afghanistan-the-ideology-and-evolution-of-the-islamic-statekhorasan-101630068689060.html

27-08-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram administers nearly 67k jabs on mega vaccination day||The Gurugram health department and private hospitals administered at least 66,877 doses, with nearly 67% of them being dose-2 of the two-shot vaccine regimen, in a mega vaccination drive held on Friday. The highest vaccination count on a single day continues to be 104,178, recorded on June 21. “We have exceeded the target of ensuring 60% of the vaccinations are second dose jabs. This was achieved with precise planning based on the estimate of people awaiting their second shot,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. The initial plan was to administer doses to about 64,160 people. Of these, 15,080 doses were to be those requiring their first dose. Across 288 vaccination centres on Friday, 22,128 took their first jab and 44, 749 got their second shot. Nearly 77% (51,937) of the vaccination took at government health centres and 14,940 at private hospitals. Vaccination in August has exceeded the count from July. At least 3,44,867 doses were administered in July, whereas 4,52,542 doses had been given in August till Friday. Data on Cowin platform shows that the vaccination drive picked up pace from June 23 backed by regular vaccine supply from the state health department. The vaccination drive had an uneven pace due to the shortage of vaccines from May 1 onwards, when vaccination opened for those between 18 and 45 years. Private hospitals and states were directed to procure the vaccine stock directly from the manufacturer. Later the policy was revised on June 21, with the central government procuring 75% of all vaccine doses and providing it directly to the states. The remaining 25% is procured by private hospitals, for which they have to submit details with the health department. This has led to an increase in vaccination in August. So far, at least 23,29,375 doses have been administered. Out of this 16,75,461 people have taken the first shot, while 6,56,848 people are inoculated with both doses. It shows that nearly 80% of the population of the district (almost 21 lakh eligible for vaccination) has taken their first shot. The focus is currently on increasing second dose inoculation by reserving 60% doses for the second shot and 40% for the first shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-administers-nearly-67k-jabs-on-mega-vaccination-day-101630088972853.html
27-08-2021||Delhi||SC seeks govt response over report claiming poor condition of demolished Khori village residents||The Supreme Court on Friday sought the responses of the Haryana government and the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) to a report by a group of lawyers and activists who, during a spot visit earloer this month, claimed to have found that the residents of the demolished Khori village were living in abject conditions with little food and limited temporary shelter provisions.The report said that following the order of the Supreme Court to demolish the settlement that came up on Aravalli land, over 100,000 residents were “pushed and thrown into harrowing times”. With accommodation for just 150 persons at the adjoining Radha Soami Bhawan, the other residents are using the demolition debris and tarpaulin sheets to set up temporary shelters, it said.This was contrary to the claims by the corporation that it will provide alternative accommodation till the state came up with a rehabilitation policy for them.The team of nine lawyers and activists, mostly from Delhi, that visited the Radha Soami Bhawan on August 6, said it found that food was only occasionally provided, and that too not by the corporation, but by the Bhawan officials and other NGOs. Residents told them that the police had stopped an NGO from supplying food, and that due to the torrential rain and absence of toilets, they often fell ill, the team claimed.Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves appearing for some of the affected residents presented the report to the court saying, “It is a shocking state of affairs.” He said that all MCF and state government’s claims to the court of a rehabilitation policy were false.“Most residents have refused to vacate the site as they have no other place to go. Despite heavy and incessant rains, most were forced to live at the demolished site itself, as the temporary shelter promised by the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad was far from adequate,” the report filed through advocate Satya Mitra said.The bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari asked the state and MCF to respond to the report by September 3. The next hearing in the case will be on September 6.The MCF had filed a compliance affidavit in the top court on August 23 highlighting the steps taken by them after the demolition. It said, “The corporation took humanitarian approach while removing the persons residing in the unauthorised structures and following all the mandatory COVID protocols. The corporation temporarily arranged for food, shelter, medicines, toilets, at Radha Soami Satsang Bhawan, adjacent to the 150 acres land (where Khori Village stood), which was made encroachment free.”It further stated that cooked food is being served on regular basis from July 16 at the Radha Soami Bhawan.Senior advocate Arun Bhardwaj who appeared for the MCF informed the Court that the “Housing Plan for the Rehabilitation of Khori (Lakkarpur revenue estate) Jhuggi Dwellers” has been finalised and will be placed before the Court.Meanwhile, the Court also received another application from a woman resident of the demolished Khori settlement who said, “The facilities in the temporary shelter provided at the Radha Swami Satsang are woefully inadequate. The temporary shelter facility is a shed which is completely exposed to the elements, with a mud floor, and no partition for privacy of women and lactating mothers.” The Court directed the state to respond to this application too by the next date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sc-seeks-govt-response-over-report-claiming-poor-condition-of-demolished-khori-village-residents-101630088972177.html
27-08-2021||Gurugram||With help of special cameras, cops to issue e-challan to violators for jumping red light at 25 points in Gurugram||There are 25 points in the city now where jumping a red light will lead to a challan being issued against the offending vehicle, even if a traffic police marshall is nowhere in sight.The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and the Gurugram traffic police have installed red light violation detection cameras (RLVD) that monitor these crossings 24/7, and a system now automatically generates the challan and alerts the vehicle owner via text message.Although the first such e-challan was issued by Gurugram traffic police in March, the system’s coverage was extended only last week.As per traffic police officers, RLVD cameras are placed at different corners of a junction or crossing. As soon a traffic signal turns red, the RLVD camera at that end goes online and captures the image or footage of an offending vehicle.Gurugram traffic police deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Ravinder Singh Tomar said that the cameras are equipped with number plate readers that transmits the information to the system that generates the e-challan and sends the text alert to the owner.Feeds from all cameras are monitored at the traffic police tower in Sushant Lok 1 and the GMDA’s integrated command and control centre (ICCC) in Sector 44, he added.“The RLVD cameras are a big help to the Gurugram traffic police in monitoring traffic signal violations. It will also help reduce accidents on these stretches as drivers will be wary of jumping a signal,” said Tomar.According to the Gurugram traffic police, jumping a traffic signal will attract a penalty of ₹5,000 at the first instance, and ₹10,000 for a subsequent offence.Some of the prominent locations where RLVD cameras have been installed include Bakhtawar Chowk, Rezangla Chowk, MG Road, Galleria Market, IFFCO Chowk metro station, HUDA City Centre, Rajiv Chowk, Subhash Chowk, Bristol Chowk, Vatika Chowk, Signature Towers, Hero Honda Chowk, and IMT Chowk.At a few of these locations, existing cameras were upgraded with the RLVD feature, said GMDA officials, as part of the Smart City initiative of installing 2,000 cameras across the city for surveillance.“So far, we have installed 230 RLVD cameras across 25 locations, and work on installing the cameras at the remaining five locations is ongoing. In total, there will be around 315 such cameras,” said Kapil Bardeja, chief executive officer (CEO) and co-founder of Vehant Technologies, GMDA’s subcontractor for the RLVD project.GMDA officials said similar cameras are expected to be installed at Khushboo Chowk, Pataudi Chowk, Basai flyover Ambedkar Chowk and Sitaram Singla Chowk by the end of next month.Urban transport systems design expert Sewa Ram said that apart from relying on technology, Gurugram could do with some simple solutions too. “Besides enforcement, the GMDA and traffic police need to ensure that proper markings are made at the 25 points. Lanes, stop lines, and zebra crossings should be properly marked and painted so that a violation can be easily spotted, on the basis of which e-challan can be generated,” said Ram who is also a faculty at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/with-help-of-special-cameras-cops-to-issue-e-challan-to-violators-for-jumping-red-light-at-25-points-in-gurugram-101630088970600.html

The encroachments were detected in Sohna, Gwal Pahari, Raisina areas of the district, they added. Gurugram divisional forest officer Rajeev Tejyan said that the department conducted a ground survey over the last one month. “In it, we identified encroachments over 225 acres of the Aravallis. We are still waiting for reports of a drone survey conducted by a private agency after which we will be able to know more about minor pockets of encroached forest land. That might push the total encroached area to 250 acres,” said Tejyan, adding that that report will likely be submitted to the department by Monday. The structures were constructed over decades, said the official. According to the records of the forest department, 16,803 acres in Gurugram district fall under the Aravallis, which is protected under the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA). According to directives from the Supreme Court, PLPA land will have the protection as stated under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, which states that “no state government or other authority shall make, except with the prior approval of the central government, any order directing that any forest land or any portion thereof may be used for any non-forest purpose.” The forest department said it sent notices to owners of over 500 illegal structures in the last one and half months, of which around 50 that covered 36 acres were demolished since last week. “In the past few days, demolition drives were conducted in Ghata, Gwal Pahari, Kadipur and Basai. This follows orders of the Supreme Court that demanded little toleration of such encroachment. The demolition drive will continue for a few more days,” said Tejyan. In July, the Supreme Court, while hearing a case about the demolition of Khori village in Faridabad, observed that “the direction to remove all unauthorised structures standing on the forest land applies to all such structures without any exception.” After this, the forest department began razin illegal structures, including farmhouses, banquet halls and institutes on Aravalli land.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/forest-department-survey-finds-225-acres-of-aravallis-in-gurugram-encroached-101630088971312.html
27-08-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad administers 66k jabs, Noida 32k in 3rd mega jab drive||The third-mega Covid-19 vaccination drive held across Uttar Pradesh on Friday saw Ghaziabad district surpassing the official target of administering 57,600 doses but fell way short of meeting its own target of inoculating 90,000 people. Officials said that low availability of vaccines and people not turning up to take the shot were reasons why they couldn’t meet the target of administering 90,000 doses. According to the Cowin dashboard, Ghaziabad district administered 66,389 doses till 8:30pm on Friday and stood seventh in the state in terms of inoculating beneficiaries. Total 147 vaccination centres were in operation on Friday. “We were aiming to administer at least 75,000 doses and prepared a micro-plan for administering 90,000 doses during the mega vaccination drive on Friday. However, low availability of vaccines hampered the process. We had only 67,000 doses with us, including 12,000 Covaxin doses, that is having low acceptability here,” said Dr GP Mathuria, nodal officer for the vaccination drive. During the first mega drive launched by the state government, Ghaziabad administered 79,822 doses in a single day and topped among the 75 districts in UP. Officials said that their micro plan was further hampered with beneficiaries not turning up to take the shot. “Many beneficiaries booked their slots on Friday but did not turn up. Our staff kept waiting for them till evening but they did not come. All these factors affected the vaccination drive,” Mathuria added. So far, the district has administered 19,43,348 doses, including 398,665 second doses. Meanwhile, Gautam Budh Nagar district administered over 32,000 doses from its 142 inoculation centres on Friday. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said almost all the centres achieved their vaccination targets for the day on Friday. “The district health department planned the vaccination centres in a way so that even people residing in the remote areas could easily come to the booths to take the jabs. Altogether, 32,561 vaccine doses were administered on Friday, of which 25,573 received their first shot,” said Suhas adding that this week, they have crossed last week’s vaccination figures. The DM further said nearly 96% of the total eligible population of 1,589,815 have already taken the first shot. Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district immunisation officer, said currently, the health department is left with around 25,000 vaccine doses . “With this stock, we can easily run the vaccination drive for three more days with an average daily vaccination of 8,000 doses. We have sent our requisition for more vaccines to the state health department,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-administers-66k-jabs-noida-32k-in-3rd-mega-jab-drive-101630088969893.html
27-08-2021||Bhopal||3 MP recruitment papers were leaked day before test, cancelled: Minister||BHOPAL: Questions papers of three recruitment examinations conducted by Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board were leaked by a private company, state home minister Narottam Mishra said on Friday evening after the government cancelled the three examinations.The government’s decision followed an investigation by the Madhya Pradesh state electronic development corporation (MPSEDC) which looked at the examinations conducted to recruit senior agriculture development officers, rural agriculture development officers and nursing staff.The investigation has been handed over to cyber cell for further investigation and the process of blacklisting NSEIT, a private company contracted to conduct the recruitment exam, has been initiated, the minister said. The private company did not comment on the decision but it has rejected the accusation in the past.HT first reported about the irregularities in the examinations held this year after candidates alleged that the ten who topped the test were from same region, had an unimpressive academic record and ended up making similar mistakes in their examination.The candidates had then also alleged that the company which conducted the exam had run into trouble in other states due to irregularities.After media reports and objections raised by candidates, the state’s professional examination board officials carried out checks but didn’t find any irregularities in the system. “The matter was forwarded to MPSEDC for technical investigation to check the digital footprints and logs of all the 10 recruitment exams conducted by MPPEB in the past one year,” home minister Narottam Mishra said.“In their investigation, MPSEDC officers found irregularities in three exams while the cleanchit was given to seven other exams. The investigators found that a question paper of agriculture development officer recruitment exam was downloaded according to one of the logs on February 10, a day before the examination. The paper was not downloaded at the office (of) MPPEB but at personal computer of an unidentified person. That confirmed the suspicion that the paper was leaked by someone,” said the letter released by the home department. “Similarly, investigators found that the question papers of recruitment exam for nursing and paramedical staff had been downloaded illegally on January 7. In the investigation the involvement of the company and outsiders are found as the downloading was done outside,” said the letter. “As of now the investigators haven’t found any involvement of MPPEB officers. More will be come out in probe of cyber cell. Now onwards, every recruitment exam will be scruitinised technically before the announcement of result, said Mishra.Among those who had complained was Ranjeet Raghunath who appeared for the agriculture officers recruitment exam. “We are happy that we got justice. It was Vyapam like scam and we fought hard against it.”The Congress attacked the state government for failing to prevent the Vyapam-like scam.“It is a very big issue that after seven years of Vyapam scam, the state government failed to set up a fool-proof system to stop irregularities. The matter should be investigated independently by CBI because such irregularities can’t be happen without involvement of MPPEB officers, said Ajay Singh Yadav, spokesperson, MP Congress Committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/3-mp-recruitment-papers-were-leaked-day-before-test-cancelled-minister-101630088851221.html

The man was arrested after Surajkund police station officers confirmed to their Delhi counterparts that they recovered the body of a woman and were probing the case, senior police officers said on Friday.The arrested man was identified as Mohammad Nizamuddin, a resident of Jaitpur Extension. He was produced before a court for handing over his custody to the Haryana police. Nizamuddin told the police that he killed his wife because he suspected her of being in a relationship with another man, the officers said.Deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena said, “Nizamuddin walked into the Kalindi Kunj police station on Friday morning and confessed to inflicting fatal injuries on his wife, Rabia, at Surajkund in Faridabad on August 26. His statement was recorded at the police station.”According to his statement, Nizamuddin has been working with civil defence as House Fire Party (HFP). In January 2020, he met Rabia, a resident of Sangam Vihar, when she had come to the office of the district magistrate in Lajpat Nagar. She was also selected for the civil defence. Nizamuddin helped her in getting her identity card. They became friends, exchanged their mobile numbers, and started talking and chatting with each other.“Nizamuddin told us that on June 11 this year, the two got married at Saket Court. Some days later, Nizamuddin learnt that she had alleged affairs with other persons. He tried many to talk to her to resolve the issue but she declined,” the DCP said, quoting Nizamuddin’s statement.On August 26, DCP Meena said, Nizamuddin called Rabia at Lajpat Nagar and they rode towards Surajkund, towards Palli Road on his bike. Nizamuddin stopped the bike and they entered into an argument over the same issue.“In a fit of rage, Nizamuddin repeatedly attacked Rabia with a knife and killed her. Thereafter, he dragged her body towards bushes, left it there and returned to Delhi. On Friday morning, out of guilt he came to the Kalindi Kunj police station and confessed to his crime. He was arrested after the facts were verified from the Surajkund police station,” added the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhiman-kills-wife-in-surajkund-walks-into-kalindi-kunj-police-station-to-confess-crime-101630088609893.html
27-08-2021||Delhi||North Delhi Civic body exempts houses of less than 50sqm area from property tax net||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Friday exempted housing units measuring up to 50 square metres from paying property tax, a move that officials said will benefit over three lakh housing units under its jurisdiction.The proposal was presented and approved in the corporation’s House meeting on Friday.Leader of the House (LOH) Chhail Bihari Goswami, who proposed the scheme in the House, said, “All residential properties up to 50 square metres including those living in approved colonies, rural areas and even unauthorised colonies, will be exempt from paying house tax to the corporation. Though we are trying to implement the scheme from this year itself, the notification will take time. That said, it will certainly come into effect from the next financial year. In this case, these house owners will have to pay the tax for just the current financial year,”said Goswami.He added that the scheme has been proposed in order to provide relief to the economically weaker sections who have been hit the hardest because of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.The move comes even as the Delhi high court on Thursday warned the North Delhi Municipal Corporation that it will order attaching and selling of the civic body’s assets if the civic body failed to disburse the salaries of its employees in six hospitals.When asked about the fund shortage, Goswami said that several measures have been taken over the years to boost the corporation’s revenue. “Even in the past year, we managed to generate extra revenue of ₹250 crore by introducing different methods such as extending the coverage of property taxpayers, auctioning of parking lots etc. We will manage to earn as much revenue. At this point, providing economic relief to people is of utmost importance,” he said. Among the other decisions taken during the House meeting include waiving off pending property tax for all commercial properties in unauthorised colonies for past few years. “These property owners are required to pay the tax just for the current and the previous financial years while the rest will be waived off. A notification to this regard will be issued soon,” said Goswami.Besides, all residential properties in unauthorised colonies and houses in rural areas (those falling under Lal Dora and Lal Dora Extension) have also been extended relief. “They will just have to pay the property tax for the current financial year,” he added.The corporation has also rolled back the property tax rates hiked for commercial properties last year based on the recommendations of the Municipal Evaluation Committee-III. “This is applicable to all commercial properties under the civic body. They will have to pay the tax as per previously existing rates,” the LOH said.He added that the schemes will help business hit by the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/north-delhi-civic-body-exempts-houses-of-less-than-50sqm-area-from-property-tax-net-101630088370493.html

The robbery was captured by a CCTV camera installed near the crime scene. The video footage helped the police identify and nab the suspects. Of the total stolen money, ₹1,000 was recovered from the duo, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (north-west) Usha Rangnani said the elderly man, Shyam Lal, in his complaint told the police that on the night of August 25, he was feeling unwell and went to nearby Babu Jagjivan Ram hospital for a checkup. While returning home around 4am on August 26, the duo choked him and robbed him of his money. The CCTV footage of the incident was later widely circulated on social media. The video shows Lal, who works as a technician in a factory in Ghaziabad, walking alone with a black bag on his shoulder. Soon two people overpower him from behind. One of them chokes him while the other searches his pockets. After robbing the elderly man of his money, the two can be seen fleeing the scene, the police said.“The elderly man went home and told his family about the crime. They brought him to the Jahangirpuri police station, where a case was registered and teams were formed to nab the robbers,” said DCP Rangnani.The investigating team scanned the CCTV cameras installed near the crime scene and found footage of the robbery. The suspects were identified and caught following searches. One of them was identified as Ajay,18, a resident of EE Block in Jahangirpuri. The second suspect is a minor boy aged around 17, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-18-year-old-man-underage-friend-held-for-choking-man-and-robbing-him-101630088310654.html

The BMC’s E ward has decided to conduct screening in nearby night shelters where people reside in small groups.On Thursday, the BMC in a statement had said that it has sealed St Joseph boarding school and orphanage in Agripada at Mumbai Central. The BMC had on Tuesday conducted a fever camp and tested 95 people for Covid-19. Around 16 children and six staffers were tested positive for Covid prompting the BMC to seal the school. However, schools are shut in the city from March 2020, however, in this school, the orphanage is functional.Manish Valanju, assistant municipal commissioner of BMC’s E ward, under which this school falls, said, “We will again conduct a fever camp next week, on Monday or Tuesday. We will conduct mass testing at this camp anticipating the onset of symptoms might take that much time.” Valanju added, “We are also going to check night shelters or those places where a small group of people reside. We will do screening and if required, even tests will be conducted at such places.”Meanwhile, according to BMC’s standard operating procedure (SOP), it organises fever camps in areas where they suspect high-risk contacts of patients are likely to be infected, or in localities where a series of cases have been found in clusters in a short period of time. Earlier this month, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal directed the civic administration across all wards to increase contact tracing by 1:20 from 1:15 (trace up to 20 high-risk contacts of one positive case), and also increase the number of tests conducted in the city daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-conduct-2nd-fever-camp-at-agripada-school-101630087952699.html
27-08-2021||Mumbai||71% of Mumbai’s greenhouse gas emissions due to electricity usage: Study||A staggering 71% of the city’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be attributed to the energy sector, according to a recent analysis by the World Resources Institute (WRI) India. Electricity generated by thermal power plants in peri-urban areas, in turn, consumed within the boundaries of the Mumbai city and suburban districts, emitted a total of 24,235,804 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2Eq) GHGs in 2019. The majority contribution of the energy sector is not surprising, given the high domestic demand for power, along with the fact that 95% of all electricity consumed in Mumbai is entirely coal-based. Of the emissions within this 71% bracket, residential electricity usage makes up 55%, while 45% comes from commercial and institutional sources, and 4% from industries.This is followed by the transport sector, which emitted 82,21,902 tCO2Eq of carbon in 2019, making up 24% of Mumbai’s total GHG emissions. Within this bracket, aviation contributes 45% of all GHG emissions, vehicles 44%, railways 9% and waterways 2%. In keeping with established trends globally, private vehicles, which make up only around 10% of the modal share of transport in Mumbai contributed a disproportionate amount of GHG emissions as compared to mass transit systems like railways (which make up over 40% of the modal split).These details are part of a ‘GHG inventory’ for Mumbai, created using an Excel-based tool developed by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, called the City Inventory Reporting and Information System (CIRIS). The GHG inventory is one of the preliminary steps undertaken before drafting a dedicated Climate Action Plan (CAP) for the city, which is now expected to be ready by November. HT was the first to report the development on June 25 this year. WRI has been engaged as a consultant for the same by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai.The remaining 5% of tCO2Eq emissions are contributed by the waste sector, which in 2019 emitted 18,53,741 tCO2Eq carbon. In all, Mumbai’s annual GHG emissions for the year 2019 stood at a total of 34.3 million tonnes of carbon. This does not include other townships and municipalities in the larger Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Per capita, Mumbai emitted 2.67 tonnes of carbon in 2019, which is higher than the national average of around 1.91 million tCO2E2 per person per year.The GHG inventory is essentially a baseline assessment that will help to plan emissions reductions for the near term (2030), medium-term (2040) and long-term (2050). With Mumbai expected to join four other Maharashtra cities in the ‘Race to Zero’ campaign, which was founded last December under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, these targets are ambitious.“By our commitment to Race to Zero, Mumbai will aim to cut carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in half by 2030 and aim to achieve net-zero emissions by the year 2040,” said Saurabh Punamiya, policy and engagements secretary (private) to Aaditya Thackeray, cabinet environment minister.The role of greenhouse gases in global warming is well documented, and there is an increasing amount of meteorological evidence to demonstrate the effects of global warming in Mumbai. According to data from the India Meteorological Department’s automatic weather station in Santacruz, for example, the city has recorded annual mean temperature higher than normal for 14 consecutive years, since the year 2007. The ambient temperature trend analysed by WRI using IMD data over the past 47 years shows a steady increase in nighttime temperatures throughout the year. Seasonally, the winter months of November to February are warming up at a fast pace. This coincides with worrying trends in rainfall patterns. The past 10 years have seen a marked increase in extreme-rainfall-events (EREs), resulting in frequent conditions of waterlogging and flooding. The MCGM’s automatic weather stations (AWS) data suggests that Mumbai sees, on average, six heavy (64.5 – 115.5 mm), five very heavy (115.6 – 204.4 mm), and four extremely heavy (> 204.5 mm) rain events per year, with a marked increase in the number of extremely heavy rain events between 2017 and 2020. Spatial mapping of these weather stations carried out by WRI shows that localised clusters in the western and central areas of the city — Worli-Dadar, Kurla and Andheri — are most vulnerable. Coastal risks due to storm surge, coastal inundation, and sea intrusion are also exacerbated during monsoon months.Independent experts were reluctant to comment on the specifics of WRI’s findings, but said that the data prima facie is not unexpected. Dr. Anjal Prakash, research director at the Indian School of Business (ISB) and a lead author of the ongoing 6th Assessment report of IPCC (where he is involved in the chapter on cities, settlements and key infrastructure), said, “I cannot comment on the data as I have not seen it, but there is no doubt that Mumbai is an extremely vulnerable city. It has so far lacked a coherent strategy and vision to develop climate resilience. It is worrying given the signs we are seeing, including increasing cyclones and more heavier, irregular precipitation. There is a deep uncertainty developing around rainfall and severe weather events. Climate action plans needs to posit solutions to this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/71-of-mumbai-s-greenhouse-gas-emissions-due-to-electricity-usage-study-101630087951470.html
27-08-2021||Mumbai||Don’t act against private schools over fee issue, Bombay HC directs Maharashtra govt||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday temporarily restrained the state from taking any coercive steps against private schools, if they refuse to reduce fees for the current academic year by 15% in terms of the August 12 government resolution of the state government.HC also directed the state government to respond to the petition filed by the Association of Private Schools which has challenged the August 12 government resolution which has asked schools to reduce fees for the academic year 2021-22 by 15%. The challenge in the petition has been based on the ground that the government did not amend the Fee Act or pass any ordinance before issuing the GR.The petition is now posted for further hearing on September 20. The division bench of justice R D Dhanuka and justice R I Chagla while hearing a petition by the Association of Indian Schools (ICSE and CBSE-affiliated schools) on August 25 was informed by senior advocate Pravin Samdhani that the petition challenged the validity of the GR on various grounds. He submitted that the state government had exercised its executive powers under Article 162 of the constitution arbitrarily while issuing the GR. As per the GR, the school that had recovered full fees from students had to either refund 15 per cent of the fees or adjust the additional amount recovered in the fees for the next month, quarter or academic year. The GR states that in the event of any dispute, complaints should be raised with the divisional fee regulatory or the divisional grievance redressal committees whose decision will be final. “These orders will apply to schools of all boards and all mediums with immediate effect,” the GR read. The GR has also restrained schools from disallowing students who have not paid their fees either in the physical or online mode nor should they be prevented from attending exams or withholding their results. The GR is, however, not a mandatory directive to the schools. The justification for the reduction in the fees has been justified by the school education department by citing the Supreme Court’s directive to the Rajasthan government in May, this year. The directive stated that as facilities were not used by students, the fees should be reduced by 15 per cent. While issuing the GR the department stated that it had done so as the apex court had asked the Maharashtra government to consider the Rajasthan order as well. Samdhani submitted that payment of fees to be collected by the Education Institutions in Maharashtra were covered under the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011, hence the state government could not issue such a GR contrary to 2011 without making amendments to the Act or coming out with an ordinance. In light of these submissions, Samdhani informed the bench that the petitioners sought to quash and set aside the GR. Additional government pleader N C Walimbe for the school education department sought two weeks to respond to the petition. The court while allowing the request asked the petitioner association to file a rejoinder in a week thereafter. The bench in its order noted, “Till next date, the respondents shall not take any coercive steps against the petitioners for not implementing the impugned GR dated August 12, 2021.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dont-act-against-private-schools-over-fee-issue-bombay-hc-directs-maharashtra-govt-101630087710436.html

The civic body wants to be cautious as the threat of the third wave of the pandemic looms large, said civic officials.The BMC has appealed to citizens that they should get themselves tested at 250 civic-run centres where free testing camps are being conducted.In a statement issued on Friday, the BMC said, “Citizens should get tested for Covid-19 immediately if they come in contact with Covid infected patients or find any symptoms in themselves. Free Covid test facility on behalf of BMC is available at more than 250 centres in the city.”As per predictions of experts and authorities, the third wave of Covid-19 cases is likely to be recorded anytime between September and November, during the festival season, civic officials pointed out.Further, to handle the third wave of Covid in a better way, the BMC plans to increase testing figures from the daily 30-35 thousand tests to around 40-50 thousand tests. For example, on Thursday, the BMC conducted 35,870 tests in which 362 cases were detected positive which means a positivity rate of 1.00%.Until now, 9,096,263 tests have been conducted in the city and the overall positivity rate is 8.16%. Mumbai was the first city in the country to liberalise testing for all citizens irrespective of being symptomatic or not on July 7, 2021.Meanwhile, on Friday, 362 cases were reported followed by five deaths taking the tally to 742,763 cases and 15,968 deaths. The city’s recovery rate is 97.11% and the mortality rate is 2.14%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-bmc-appeals-citizens-to-get-tested-amid-fear-of-3rd-covid-wave-101630087350638.html

The tally of active cases slightly increased to 51,574 as 3,301 recoveries were reported in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the Central government has suggested the state to impose restrictions in the districts where test positivity is higher during upcoming festivals such as Dahi Handi and Ganesh Chaturthi.The state records 170 deaths on Thursday, taking the toll to 136,900. Pune reported the highest toll with 57 deaths. Of them, 15 were found in the district and the rest 42 were in the city. It was followed by Satara with 29 fatalities.Despite relaxations granted by the state government, no significant change is observed in the state yet. There are predictions that the third wave may hit the state by November or December and the state is preparing for it accordingly. There are 10 districts — Solapur, Satara, Sangli, Ahmednagar, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Kolhapur, Beed, Osmanabad and Pune — where growth rate is still higher than the average growth rate of the state, according to the data compiled by the state health department.The average growth rate of the state is 0.07%.“Even though the trajectory of daily new cases has shown a decline over the last month, there are some districts in Maharashtra which are showing early signs of an upsurge in Covid-19 cases and test positivity… Given mass events and public gathering expected during celebrations of upcoming festivals (including Dahi Handi and Ganesh Utsav) in Maharashtra, it is advised that the state may consider imposing and enforcing local restrictions in public observation of these festivals and mass gatherings,” stated a letter written Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, ministry of health and family welfare on August 27.Maharashtra is the state with the highest number of Covid-19 cases. Now, it also has maximum Delta plus variant cases.“Once the second wave is gone, it takes another 100 days for the virus to get smarter which subsequently turns into another wave unless there is no new variant of concern that comes up. It is unlikely that there will be any other wave that will hit the state before November or December unless there is an outbreak of a novel variant of concern or interest,” said a senior health official, wishing not to be named.On Thursday, the state health minister Rajesh Tope said they are making all the preparations considering the predictions about the third wave. “We will be appointing 1,200 doctors by September 5. The per-day oxygen supply is being increased from 1,200 metric tonnes to 2,000 metric tonnes. We have purchased 1,000 ambulances and have taken a ₹5,000 crore loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the construction of rural hospitals,” said Tope. “We had 0.65 million active patients during the second wave and going by the prediction the number of active patients will go up to 1.3 million active patients and are ramping up the infrastructure accordingly,” he added.On Sunday, Mumbai clocked 362 cases and reported a total of 742,763 cases to date. It also recorded five fatalities taking the toll of 15,968.In the last 24 hours, the state tested 207,954 samples and had a positivity rate of 2.23%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 12.11%, according to the data issued by the state health department.The state also vaccinated 978,722 doses on Friday and has administered a total of 56,324,037 doses to date, according to the data available on the Co-Win portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-4-654-new-cases-170-deaths-101630086990464.html

The move comes in view of growing demand and the need to boost the gross enrolment ratio (GER), which continues to be very low in the state at 14.4, nearly half the national average.Choudhary said the government would welcome proposals from interested colleges if they are routed through the universities concerned with their recommendation and give them nod on a priority basis.“There have been a lot of demands in this regard to chief minister Nitish Kumar as well as to the education department,” he said.The minister said his department recently got proposals from two districts for starting PG education — one at BSS College (Supaul) and another at KKM College (Jamui). “We have decided to give approval. There are 10 districts where PG teaching is not available in any college. If the proposals come from the remaining eight districts through a proper channel, we will certainly like to approve them. With incentives, girls’ enrolment has increased manifold at the secondary, higher secondary and graduation level and they need institutions nearby to go further,“ he said.However, the task is not easy, considering the low number of colleges per lakh population in the state, huge vacancies, poor grading by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) due to lack of proper infrastructure. The shortage of teachers is particularly acute in places away from main towns and the efforts to rope in guest teachers has not been very successful. Besides, the academic sessions continue to be late in most universities. Even in the universities where PG teaching is on, the semester system is not fully in place while at the undergraduate level, it is totally missing in state universities. As per the 2019 report of the All India Survey for higher education (AISHE), Bihar still has just seven colleges per lakh population with an average enrolment of 1,703, while the number of colleges per lakh population in Andhra Pradesh is 51, Karnataka (59), Kerala (48), Rajasthan (37), Maharashtra (34), 31 in Gujarat and UP and 30 in West Bengal with much lower average enrolment.The minister said those colleges where Honours level education was on and the teacher-pupil ratio was 1:30 could start PG teaching. “For further creation of posts at the PG level, the government will go by the recommendation of the competent authority,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-plans-pg-teaching-in-every-district-101630084530261.html

The average daily milk procurement of the Bihar State Milk Co-operative Federation Ltd (COMFED), the largest milk federation in eastern India, is down 18% since the pre-Covid period of 2019-20 and 23% as compared to 2018-19. In numbers, COMFED’s average daily fresh milk procurement is now down to 14 lakh litres from 17 lakh litres in 2019-20 and 18.20 lakh litres in 2018-19, when Bihar was a milk surplus state, said officials requesting anonymity.In fact, Bihar had to source milk from Karnataka and Odisha last year to bridge its demand supply gap.Dwindling collectionIn terms of month-wise comparison, the early floods in June have led to 12.5% shortfall in COMFED’s overall milk procurement as compared to the same month last year. However, the shortfall is 22% during July this year as compared to April 2020, the first month after the March 25 lockdown, when supplies peaked to 18 lakh litres per day. The closure of sweet shops during lockdown had left farmers with no option but to sell their surplus milk to cooperatives, said industry sources. Gradually, as migrants began to return home during the pandemic, the farmers were unable to spare as much milk as they used to earlier and the supply to cooperatives began to plummet. The early floods in 15 of 38 districts of Bihar this year have contributed to a sharp decline in milk procurement in the flood-hit districts. Muzaffarpur suffered the highest 56% dip. The negative growth varies between 20% and 54% in Munger, Lakhisarai, Madhubani, Samastipur, East Champaran (Motihari), Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Darbhanga, Khagaria, Kishanganj and Katihar districts, said officials familiar with the matter. Similarly, milk production had dropped by 20% in Patna, Magadh and Saran divisions. Areas of concernThe floods this year have not allowed the cattle to graze. Besides, most fodder and cattle feed, available with the farmers, have also gone waste in floods, which have led to the death of 43 people and affected a population of 30.62 lakh in 2,104 villages. With cattle already under stress, standing in floodwaters, their yield has gone down. Cows, which used to give 12 litres of milk, are now giving an average six litres a day. What has not helped the farmers is the inward migration during the pandemic, lack of cattle vaccination and de-worming for the last two years, leading to death of many cattle, and inadequate provision of fodder by the government. For farmers, the cost of milk production has gone up with increase in dry fodder price from ₹2 per kg in 2010 to ₹6 in 2020. In flood-hit districts, it had shot up to ₹15-16 a kg. Similarly, price of green fodder had doubled to ₹2 per kg and that of cattlefeed from ₹12 to ₹24 per kg during the same period. The price of diesel has also more than doubled from ₹36 a litre in 2010. Farmers’ demandThe farmers have been pressing for government-managed outlet selling dry fodder at ₹5 per kg, as prevailing in dry fodder surplus districts. They are also demanding increase in the price of milk and reduction in cattlefeed prices. The COMFED last revised milk prices by an average ₹2 per litre in February this year, with its 1 litre pouch of Sudha cow milk costing ₹43, as against some other reputed brands selling at ₹45. Despite adverse conditions, government intervention has been minimal, especially in terms of providing cattlefeed and milk subsidy to farmers between 2020 and 2021. It has also failed to arrange adequate dry fodder and cattlefeed at equitable rate. Vinod Singh Gunjiyal, director, animal and fisheries resources, did not respond to phone calls and text messages. While the annualised average procurement has gone down, the sale of milk has increased by 13% — up from 15 lakh litres a day in 2019-20 to the current daily average of 17 lakh litres. To meet the demand and supply gap of fresh milk, the COMFED uses nearly 20% to 30% reconstituted milk or milk powder, a standard practice in the industry. “The shortfall in our milk procurement is primarily due to floods and the return of the migrants during the pandemic, as a result of which consumption of milk in rural areas has increased. We are meeting the shortfall in procurement of fresh milk from the milk powder produced and stored during the period of milk glut. This is the standard industry norm,” said Shikha Srivastava, managing director, COMFED. “The cycle of hitting the trough from a peak comes every 3-5 years and is not unique to Bihar. Many other states are also facing a decline in the procurement of fresh milk. We are still trying our best to facilitate milk procurement even from flood-hit areas by arranging boats to ferry supplies. We hope to get over the recession soon,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/floods-covid-turn-bihar-s-milk-surplus-into-deficit-101630084410622.html

This figure comes from data that covers the period from August 11 to August 26. The total Covid death toll in the state for the time period is 2,315, of which the three districts, Pune, Satara and Kolhapur, have together reported 1,536 fatalities, which accounts of 66.34% of the overall death toll. However, district officials state that this due to a reconciliation of the death toll based on late reporting of numbers by private hospitals.Dr Subhash Chavan, a civil surgeon in Satara district, said, “The numbers may seem higher than they actually are and this is because of the reconciliation of the number of deaths due to Covid-19. Some private hospitals delay updating the numbers. Some have delayed entering data since January. Any strict action, like cancelling the licence would be too harsh, especially since we need the support of private hospitals in case there is a third wave. However, we have told them to enter the pending numbers as soon as possible.”Dr Pradip Awate, state surveillance officer said, “The state has been reconciling the data for the past few months now. Pune continues to remain a district of concern because the rural areas are driving up the numbers. For the past three months the state health department has been reconciling the deaths pending to be updated, because of the burden on the staff or due to other practical reasons.” In the other districts, Ahmednagar’s CFR is at 2.1%, Solapur’s at 2.6%, Sangli’s at 2.7% and Ratnagiri at 3%. The cumulative CFR for the state as of Friday is 2.1%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aug-11-26-66-of-covid-deaths-in-state-from-3-districts-101630080869220.html
27-08-2021||Mumbai||C-sections, trauma care hit at manpower starved rural hospitals in Maharashtra: Survey||Routine healthcare services like cesarean sections, trauma care and other surgeries took a severe hit in rural Maharashtra during the pandemic, according to a survey by non-profit Jan Arogya Abhiyan (JAA). The result released on Friday showed at least 11 hospitals that were surveyed did not treat accident cases due to Covid, 22 rural and sub-district hospitals had stopped performing C-section procedures and 12 had stopped performing other surgical procedures. Cataract operations, minor surgeries and sterilisation procedures were postponed indefinitely as hospitals immersed into Covid care. Also, since the hospitals were already under-resourced, they could not reserve the capacity and continue routine procedures. The unavailability of services in public health facilities forced patients to go to private hospitals. This led to huge expenses and debts for many families, the report observed. Many hospitals in the state- public and private- had halted non-Covid and non-emergency services due to the fear of infection among patients. Patients too preferred delaying their treatments or opting for non-Covid facilities due to the same fear. The survey was conducted in July through a network of JAA activists and volunteers who interviewed hospital staff including doctors, nurses and administrators. The survey covered 122 Primary Health Centres (PHCs), 24 rural hospitals and 14 sub-district hospitals in Maharashtra’s 17 districts- Akola, Amravati, Ahmednagar, Osmanabad, Aurangabad, Kolhapur, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Thane, Nandurbar, Parbhani, Palghar, Pune, Beed, Yavatmal, Solapur and Hingoli.According to the report, there was only one permanent medical officer in 51% of the surveyed PHCs, which meant that one doctor catered to a population of nearly 30,000 people. Posts of specialist doctors were vacant in 46% of rural hospitals and 30% of sub-district hospitals. For instance, 81% posts for psychiatrists, 63% posts for surgeons, 47% posts for anaesthetists, 26% posts for gynaecologists, 23% posts for paediatricians and 47% posts for dentists were lying vacant in rural hospitals. “Non-covid patients have suffered tremendously during the pandemic,” said health activist Girish Bhave of JAA. “The severe lack of manpower and the overall under-resourced healthcare facilities made the situation worse, and the infrastructure fell severely short,” said Bhave. He cited the example of Kerala which had 1.1 beds per 1,000 population while Maharashtra had only 0.4 beds per 1,000. JAA member Dr Madhavi Agashe said that children’s programmes also took a severe hit as manpower was diverted into Covid care. Based on their findings, the JAA activists have recommended regularising contractual posts in health care, increasing the number of sub-centres, PHCs and rural hospitals, increasing the bed strength to two beds per 1,000 population and doubling the public health budget and spending. The activists also said that the Maharashtra government should resist any move to privatise public health facilities. A senior doctor attached to the Indian Medical Council said that doctors avoid serving in rural areas due to lack of infrastructure in the government facilities. “If there is no equipment, no operation theatre or other important things in the hospital, what can a doctor do? Specialists require a certain set up to practice and that is absent in rural facilities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/csections-trauma-care-hit-at-manpower-starved-rural-hospitals-in-maharashtra-survey-101630080390028.html

But today, we decided that teaching and non-teaching staff in Pune district, would be given priority for full vaccination. Because when the state government decides to reopen schools, the staff should be fully vaccinated,” said Ajit Pawar. ast week, the district administration had decided that due to a shortage of vaccines, priority would be given to the beneficiaries of the second dose. Pawar mentioned that the Serum Institute has increased production of the vaccine and the supply is expected to increase in upcoming months“Adar Poonawalla has informed us that the production of vaccines has been increased. So the demand for vaccine doses could be fulfilled. We were hoping that the number of vaccine doses would be more in August than July. It will go higher in September. Our aim is that before the third wave, the maximum population should be vaccinated,” said Ajit Pawar. Pawar also warned of the threat of the increase in Covid cases in the light of upcoming festivities. “In the relaxation order issued it has been mentioned clearly that when the daily requirement of medical oxygen surpasses 700 MT, restrictions would be imposed.

Against this backdrop, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has changed its contact tracing policy. Ward officers have been instructed to mandatorily test all close contacts of Covid positive patients immediately to avoid transmission of the infection amid relaxations in Covid-19 restrictions.As HT reported on August 11, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal along with Kakani, in a review meeting of the health department, decided to increase their contact tracing from 10 to 20 per infected patient. However, this week, the target of contact tracing was increased to 25 per infected patient.The city has been witnessing a steady rise in cases for the past few days. On August 17, Mumbai had reported 198 cases and 283 infections were registered on August 18 and 19. The next day, 322 cases were recorded. On August 21, 259 new patients were identified. The following day, 294 cases were recorded, which plunged to 226 the next day. On August 24, the daily count rose to 270, which surged to 343 cases on August 25. On Thursday, Mumbai reported 397 new Covid-19 cases, the highest daily count since July 28, when the daily count was 404.As per BMC data, the number of daily tests dropped from over 50,000 to around 30,000 a few days last week. With the reopening of establishments like shops, hotels and malls, BMC has instructed the ward officers to test all the close contacts of the infected patients immediately, even if they don’t show symptoms.“So far, we used to test close contacts after 4-5 days if they develop any symptoms. Till then, they were being instructed to get home quarantined. But now, we have instructed ward officers to test them immediately, without any delay,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC. “The movement of the people has increased with the relaxation. So, we don’t want any asymptomatic patient to infect others in the crowd,” he addedDuring the outbreak of the second wave, the civic body was blamed for inadequate contact tracing. Though the Union Health Ministry advised tracking 30 close contacts per patient, between January and February, the civic body traced only 4-5 close contacts for every patient.“With the rise of Delta Plus variants, along with vaccination, BMC needs to focus on contact tracing. Or else, it can lead to an influx of another pandemic wave,” said Dr Ravikant Singh, founder of the NGO — Doctors for You.But civic officials often hit a roadblock in contact tracing due to improper information shared by the patients.“Many times, infected patients don’t reveal the names of their close contacts. In fact, some families don’t even inform their buildings or societies about their infection. These problems are most common in non-slum areas,” said Dr Bhagyashree Kapse, ward officer, R-Central that covers Borivli.Also, instruction has been given to keep an eye on families and societies where more than one Covid-19 patient is recorded. “If any family or society is recording high transmission rate, we are sending their samples for genome sequencing to find out any possible infection from Delta or Delta plus variants,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/third-wave-mandatory-testing-of-all-close-contacts-of-covid-patients-in-mumbai-101630079669711.html

What can you tell about the new MTech course in Defence technology starting from this academic year?“We are starting the MTech programme with AICTE who have worked out this programme. We have experimented first at the Gujarat university wherein IDST has prepared a complete syllabus. AICTE readily agreed to start the course in Defence technology and more than 40 institutes have already applied to take the course. Defence technology was not taught anywhere till now. Even BTech courses now have electives. As this subject is taught and students come out with the knowledge and technology, whether he/she works in R &D, design or works in industry the student gets a necessary background. So skill set development is done and we are creating an ecosystem for the defence sector.”Do you see any change in the mindset of parents who want to send their children to pursue a course in defence technology?Absolutely, our prime minister is pushing skill sets and ‘Make in India’, so what is happening is there are defence technologies and industries to develop. And so naturally parents also come forward to send their child to study and pursue a career in this field. Within a short time we can see more than 40 institutions in the country have come forward for this MTech course in Defence technology. For the first time DRDO is working along with ministry of higher education for research and development in defence. Can you elaborate?There are 500 PhD students approved by the ministry of higher education, and already 37 students have joined various institutions. They specially work on defence-related subjects and in future it will certainly benefit our country in defence security. The joining process is going on and it will continue from now till the 500 approved PhD students join their respective universities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/500-phd-students-will-be-working-on-defence-related-subjects-across-the-country-101630075408746.html
27-08-2021||Chandigarh||Decision to procure less Bajra a death blow to farmers: Surjewala||Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala on Friday termed the Haryana government’s decision to procure 80% less Bajra than the previous year a death blow to farmers.Referring to the state government’s reply in the Vidhan Sabha in response to a question by Congress MLA Neeraj Sharma, Surjewala said the state government has informed that it had procured about 7.76 lakh MT millet in Haryana last year.“But for this year, the target has been reduced to just 1.5 lakh MT. If this happens, what will be the fate of farmers producing 6.27 lakh MT millet and who will buy their crops?” the former minister asked.Surjewala said millet is a major crop grown in Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Hisar, Jhajjar, Mewat, Mahendragarh, Palwal, Rewari, Rohtak, Sirsa districts of Haryana. Farmers will be forced to sell their millet crop at throwaway prices and will suffer huge financial losses, he added.He said Bhavantar Yojana in Haryana has proved to be just a hollow and paper scheme due to which farmers are not getting any relief so the government cannot escape its responsibility of procuring millet production in the guise of Bhavantar Yojana.“The extent of the government’s insensitivity has reached such a point that this time they have curtailed the government procurement of millet to just 20%,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/decision-to-procure-less-bajra-a-death-blow-to-farmers-surjewala-101630073549269.html
27-08-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Sounds of Silence||For a man whose name was synonymous with big media, monumental marketing and mega brand building, it is ironic that what I will most remember about late Pradeep Guha, who I had the privilege to work with for almost a decade, are his silences. The profound pause before he would weigh in on some or the other crucial decision, that would impact lakhs worth of business or the next day’s headlines, or both. The two-second lull before he would effortlessly, as if from thin air, come up with a brilliant solution to a problem that had vexed an entire department of a dozen or more high-paid management whizzes. The ever watchful, reticence with which he’d sit in a room full of big talkers and hard blowers, assessing the exact truth of what was being spoken and why. The intense stillness with which he would collect his thoughts and carefully choose his words before broaching a difficult but much-needed conversation. The unexpected half-beat gap between sentences in which he would recognise the black humour in a dire situation, making his eyes twinkle and his frown change into a delighted smile. Indeed, PG’s silences were as famous as his gruff taciturn demeanour and his diminutive power-packed presence. In them you could almost hear his prodigious, supercomputer of a brain, computing, assessing, analysing, determining... *************************************************************** I’d hardly known much about him when I’d cold-called him for an appointment in the mid-nineties, after returning to Mumbai, having spent 10 years away in Kolkata and Delhi. TOI, where I had worked briefly in the late Seventies, had been a high-minded, venerable institution with exalted editors spinning in their individual orbits, supported by phalanxes of devoted editorial and clerical staff. Since then, I was told much had changed, and one of the men responsible for most of it was Samir Jain’s all-powerful right-hand man — Pradeep Guha, known by his acronym PG. In need of regular work, my idea had been to call on PG and try to interest him in giving me some freelance assignment in the form of a regular column, in one or the other of his new initiatives. What had greeted me when I alighted on the second floor to proceed to his office had made my jaw drop. Acres of polished marble, granite and teak interspersed with expensive artwork and fabrics heralded the pathway to his cabin. The sight of young smartly-dressed executives buzzing around in in a manner that evoked a beehive — a very well-oiled beehive — emphasised how very different things had become since I’d last been there. I did not have to wait long before I was ushered into his private corner room cabin, crammed with books, trophies, plaques, Ganesha statues and other glittering memorabilia and bric-a-brac. Amid it all was the man himself — soft-spoken, taciturn, politely attentive, as he heard me out. After I was done, I was afforded the first of the famous silences that I would get so used to later. “Of course, you could write for us, but why don’t you come on board as editor of the Bombay Times?” he’d said, so softly, that at first, I thought I’d misheard him. But I hadn’t.. “There is a vacancy at the moment,” he’d continued, “And I think you’d be ideal for the job.” To say I was stunned would be an understatement. Yes, by then, I’d been a journalist for two decades, but editing a newspaper, even one which at that time was a twice a week, four-pager, seemed like another ball game altogether — one which I felt I had neither the capability nor the confidence for. And I told him so. Again, another pause, another silence. “Think about it for a few days,” he’d said, “I have a feeling you can do it.” “If I do accept, I’ll require a lot of hand-holding,” I recall saying, before I’d exited, my pulse racing, my head spinning... ************************************************************** To say that working with PG was like receiving a master class in media studies would be an understatement. The Nineties were a period of staggering growth for the group — Femina’s Miss Indias were erupting into international beauty title holders with alarming frequency; Filmfare had grown from being a stodgy film journal to a formidable brand which hosted much-vaunted awards nights, celebrated for their razzle dazzle performances and world class production values; Bombay Times grew rapidly from a twice-a-week supplement to a full-fledged seven-days-a-week paper, with ever-increasing pages that sometimes ran into hundreds. There were incursions in trendy new areas such as radio, retail, modelling, event management, and the approach to PG’s office often resembled Virar station on a Monday morning, except that those who waited were not ordinary commuters but A-list actors, celebrated captains of industries, advertising legends and impossibly long-legged models and international beauty queens. And at the centre of it all, as if he were the silent eye of the cyclone, was PG — a storehouse of wisdom and confidence, a fount of brilliant ideas, our supreme leader who commanded unfailing loyalty and respect. And yet, even for those among us who worked with him daily, he would remain an enigma wrapped in a puzzle inside a paradox. A man whose youth had been spent as an ardent leftist, who now headed one of the country’s most commercially successful ventures; the host of some of the biggest, most glamorous, most celebrated parties who remained a pillar of rectitude, and probity till the very end, until every last guest had made their staggering way home. The creator and confidante of some of the country’s most desirable women who not once — not ever — was known for even the slightest hint of inappropriate remark or disrespect in his dealings with them, who even as he groomed them kept his distance, and what’s more, demanded the same high standards from his entire department towards them. The inceptor of ever-glamorous mega events who, in his heart and home, remained a middle-class boy with simple, abiding family values. A warm and gracious host along with his loving wife Papia, at whose fabulous Diwali parties the country’s top film stars, media magnates and society queens rubbed shoulders with his oldest, humblest, most ordinary colleagues and friends. A tough, often exacting boss, one whose presence evoked awe and trepidation, yet someone who you knew would always have your back, if the chips were down. A man who revelled in gossip but never, not once, was known to have betrayed a confidence. ***************************************************************** Saying goodbye to someone who has had such an impact on one’s life is always tough, but with PG it is almost impossible. On the morning of his funeral, we stood in the lobby of his building — family, friends, colleagues, old and new, overwhelmed, dazed, unsure of what to do, what to say, how to proceed… The man who had created the magic that we all had experienced at one time or the other lay silent nearby — this time for ever. I began this column by saying how it was PG’s silences that spoke the most, even louder than his word or his deeds… And now, all we are left with is the silence…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-sounds-of-silence-101630070695063.html
27-08-2021||Chandigarh||Flying high on her dream, fighter pilot Mawya Sudan an inspiration||Flying officer Mawya Sudan, 24, is a trailblazer. The first woman fighter pilot from Jammu and Kashmir has fired up the imagination of girls of the border belt looking to make a career in the defence services, particularly the Indian Air Force. From drawing sketches of flying machines on the walls of her room during her childhood to becoming the 12th woman fighter pilot of the IAF, she is flying high on her dream. Her achievement is all the more special as she belongs to the remote Lamberi village on the Line of Control in Nowshera sector of Rajouri district. Located south of the Pir Panjal, where India launched the surgical strike in 2016 to avenge the attack on the Uri army camp, villages such as Lamberi see shelling by Pakistan during border skirmishes that can trigger mass migration during flare-ups. On the flight path “It was innate to her. She was always fascinated by flying machines. As a child, she would watch helicopters flying over. She would bring chalk pieces from school and draw planes on the walls. Those crude sketches gave way to posters of jets as she grew up. She dreamt of taming a big flying machine one day and she is living her dream now,” says her proud father, Vinod Sudan, an engineer with the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board. While Mawya is undergoing training at present, her father recalls her flight path. She studied at Carmel Convent School before opting for the non-medical stream at JK Public School, Kunjwani. She scored 80% and qualified for the Prime Minister’s Special Scholarship Scheme to study for a degree course in an institution outside the state of residence. She opted for MCM DAV College for Women in Chandigarh and graduated with honours in political science before joining the defence and national security studies department at Panjab University. “During her stay in Chandigarh, she underwent coaching for taking the services selection board (SSB) test. Five months into the post-graduation course and Mawya got a call to join the IAF academy at Hyderabad,” he says. Wind beneath her wingsMawya’s mother Sushma Sudan is a homemaker, while her elder sister Tanya is an alumna of Indian Institute of Management at Kozhikode and works as a consultant with a multinational company. “We have stood solidly behind our daughters, supporting them in their pursuits. Of course, Mawya faced challenges but her indomitable spirit won,” he says. Mawya is focused and self-made. “She never had a Plan B. She believes your goal has to be your passion and it should be followed objectively with single-minded devotion. She is now a soldier and to her, the country comes first,” says Sudan. Duties come before rights She focuses on performing her duties rather than cherishing the thought of rights and demanding them. “Now girls are joining Sainik Schools and will be at the National Defence Academy (NDA) as well. These are the big decisions to empower women. The government is trying to bring women to the fore in every field. Hopefully, society will welcome and adapt to these changes,” he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/flying-high-on-her-dream-fighter-pilot-mawya-sudan-an-inspiration-101630070129079.html

Addressing a gathering of traders and businessmen, Sidhu, who is the Amritsar East MLA, said on Thursday night: “Aj v mai high command nu iko gal keh k ayan, k je mai es Punjab Model de utte, ehna lokan dian asan te khra utrun, mai agle 20 saal Congress nu rajniti chon jan ni daun.

Capt Amarinder’s camp has been cornering Sidhu over these remarks. On Thursday, the chief minister put up a show of strength by hosting a dinner meeting of 58 MLAs and eight MPs. Sidhu went on to launch an indirect attack on Capt Amarinder and said, “I neither take an oath nor do I promise, but I commit.” He has been critical of the chief minister for not delivering on the promises made in the run-up to the 2017 assembly elections by taking an oath on the ‘gutka (handy book of gurbani)’ to bring the culprits of the 2015 Bargari sacrilege and police firing incidents to justice and eradicating drugs from Punjab. “I have requested the CM to cancel PPAs (power purchase agreements) and these can be done.

27-08-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Secret Option Number 6, our answer to climate change||So, what can we do about climate change? The answer is Secret Option Number 6.Let me explain.A few weeks ago our youngest, Rex (7-years-old) designed his first Powerpoint presentation by himself. He had been assigned as the Space Reporter for his Grade’s assembly and given that space exploration is one of his interests, he researched his stuff, made points, create a 3-minute script and then decided to make a presentation - like a real news report on a YouTube channel. He was super pleased with himself. Till he found out that he had to print the pictures on paper and show them while he spoke online.He took it in his stride, but one afternoon a few days later, he looked at me and said: “Paper is made from trees. And we cut lots of trees to make a few pages of paper. A computer presentation is better because it will save trees and that’s something we can do to help the environment. Should I ask her if I can just present instead of printing paper?”This wasn’t the first time he had brought up using computer software instead of paper. Throughout the last couple of years he and his brothers have been vocal about typing instead of writing their homework, digital instead of printed.Initially, I thought it was because they did not want to write by hand, since their handwriting is all over. Over a period of time, I realised they do write when they have to, but it’s not their preference because most of their work is digital.That’s not why Rex brought up the paper versus digital thing. It’s because he remembered what he’s been learning in school, what teachers are saying in class about energy, renewable sources, how we as individuals can help, switching off electricity, saving energy and so on. And he remembered his mother telling him how paper was made from trees and how using less paper would help the environment. Children follow adult behaviour. They don’t follow adult sermons (what we say), but our actions (what we do). Educators and parents and adults in general should realise this, understand this, know this, and remember this. Children also think much more and in a much wider random pattern than adults. They make many more connections than we do. Educators and parents should remember this as well. As I am learning to remember. I realised he was expecting an answer and that my answer would go into his repository of decision-making info.“Why don’t you talk to the teacher and explain your viewpoint?”He thought about it and said, “I will write an email to her.” That was last week. He’s still in dialogue with his teacher and we will see how it goes.Meanwhile, he keeps track of what I am watching and reading and asks questions whenever it’s something to do with his interest. The past few weeks it’s been mostly weather and climate and the recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). I am pretty much seasonal, having no convictions of my own on matters I don’t understand, but I read and read, and think and think. The report is voluminous and interesting and I guess also alarming, since governments and media and writers are in focus. Am hoping the focus won’t fade in a few months, because I don’t need an IPCC report to tell me the weather is changing.The past three years, Pune has mainly been grey and intermittently wet from June to January, unlike the previous 20-odd years. When I looked at the IPCC’s charts on possible future scenarios, it made immediate sense that India has a much wetter future in store in all of the scenarios. Obviously, there’s a lot that urban individuals and societies can do as their bit. Change lifestyle, change consumption patterns, reduce emissions, ask for accountable actions from government bodies, ask for responsible green products from industry and so on. But my observation is that urban educated city-societies are opting for Secret Option Number 6: educate our children to change their ways so that they can reverse the damage that we and our previous generations have done to the climate with our insatiable greed and actions on account of that greed. Which is why every school and its teachers, and climate activists and government bodies, are now droning on about climate and climate change and asking little clueless Grade 1, 2, 3, students to learn about consequences of their actions.It would help if all such evangelists also state what they are doing individually to change their habits. I am not a Bill Gates fan, but it’s more compelling to move to action on his evangelism since he clearly states how much he is adding to carbon emissions (individual and family), and how he’s changing and contributing to a healthier environment (his companies’ contribution is different).Meanwhile society (adult) is innovating and buying and selling and producing and cutting forests and dumping waste and setting up new industries and tagging everything “green” without the due diligence to know if it is actually green and sustainable. And pledging millions and billions of dollars to zero carbon, carbon neutral, go green till they are blue in the face. And then, printing paper and asking children to hand-write on reams of notebooks and print their homework on paper…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/global-village-idiot-secret-option-number-6-our-answer-to-climate-change-101630064549430.html
27-08-2021||Delhi||Speeding vehicle mows down delivery person in Delhi’s Karol Bagh||A 41-year-old delivery person of a restaurant aggregator was killed after an allegedly speeding car driven by a purportedly drunk 20-year-old student hit his motorcycle near Karol Bagh in central Delhi late on Thursday night. The colleagues and relatives of Vinod Kumar, the delivery person, accused the police of conniving with the accused and trying to weaken the case. They held a protest over it at the Karol Bagh police station. Around 4am on Friday, Ashish Kapoor, a lawyer, was allegedly assaulted and his bag containing ₹5 lakh was snatched for supposedly trying to bribe the police.A police officer, who did not want to be named, said the protesters thought the lawyer had come to settle the accident case by bribing the police. “We have come across a video clip in which some men are seen snatching a bag from a person, taking out cash from it, and alleging the money was brought to bribe the police for favouring the accident case accused. Kapoor claims he was a passer-by and had no linkages with the accused.”No case has been registered so far in connection with Kapoor’s allegations. Police were verifying allegations and counter-allegations. The investigating officer of the case was shifted to district lines to ensure a fair probe.The officer said they were trying to find out if Kapoor is connected with the family of the accused. “If not, why was he carrying ₹5 lakh, and where was he going at the time of the alleged snatching. It has been learnt that one of the protesters has Kapoor’s money. We are looking for him,” the officer said.Deputy police commissioner (central) Jasmeet Singh said the car driver, identified as Rachit Singhal, was arrested and booked for rash driving and culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Indian Penal Code Sections 279 and 304. He added Singhal’s medical examination report confirmed that he was drunk while driving the car and hit the motorcycle of Kumar, who succumbed to his injuries at a private hospital two hours after the accident. “Singhal was booked for rash and negligent driving causing death. But when his medical report confirmed he was driving under the influence of alcohol, we converted the case into culpable homicide not amounting to murder,” said Singh.Police said Kumar was returning after delivering a food order when the car hit the bike from behind.

27-08-2021||Mumbai||After good response, Navi Mumbai to add 100 more rental cycle stands||The ‘Cycle on Rent’ initiative started by Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has received a good response with over 6,000 residents using these cycles (both e-bikes and traditional bicycles) on weekly basis, officials said.The NMMC has installed 100 stands across the city with a total of 700 cycles, used by over 1.5 lakh people in the last three years. The NMMC will make these cycles available at 200 spots across the city from Diwali this year. With the hike in fuel prices in recent times, more and more people, especially delivery executives, are using these bicycles for intra-city travelling, a senior officer said. Many residents even use them for exercising or for running small errands. Nandita Kulkarni, 37, a homemaker from SBI colony in Nerul, said, “I have been using a rental bicycle service near Wonders Park in the afternoons, four to five days a week. It has been fun as a few other women from my building also join me. I started cycling at the start of this year and have lost a few kilos in the past few months. I feel much energetic now. I spend around ₹400-500 on these cycles every month.” The NMMC started the ‘Cycle on Rent’ project in association with a startup Yulu in November, 2018. Travelling on a rental bicycle is relatively cheaper than the other modes of transportation in Navi Mumbai. A user can rent a bicycle for 30 minutes by paying ₹10. After that, he has to pay ₹5 every 30 minutes. Likewise, the base rent for an e-bike is ₹5 and then goes up to ₹1.50 for every minute. The NMMC has different packages for the food delivery startups that use these bikes and cycles on a daily basis. Rajesh Kanade, deputy municipal commissioner of the NMMC (estate) said, “Presently, we are offering this service at 100 places in partnership with just one startup (Yulu) and all the bicycles and e-bikes are one-seater. We are now in a process of introducing the services at another 100 places in partnership with two other startups. In the second initiative, we will have only e-bikes and they will be two-seaters. The new e-bikes should hit the city roads before Diwali”. “By introducing such bicycles and e-bikes, we are trying to decrease the pollution level and implement the central government’s ‘last mile connectivity’ scheme in the city. For example, hundreds of people travel from Turbhe railway station to the APMC market at Vashi every day. If we start one stand (of bicycles and e-bikes) near the station and one stand near the market, those people will be able to use them for travelling. Also, we don’t have to spend much on them as their maintenance is taken care of by the respective startups,” he said. A representative from Yulu said that presently they are providing services in Navi Mumbai, Thane, BKC, and Kharghar. Of all these places, they are receiving the maximum response in Navi Mumbai. “One bicycle or e-bike is rented up to four times a day in Navi Mumbai. They are fitted with GPS and hence we can easily track their locations in case the users do not return them on time,” he said. Bhupal Singh, 36, a resident of Vashi said, “I have been using these rental bicycles for the past two years and finding it convenient. You can easily go from one place to another on these cycles by paying ₹20 to 25. For travelling the same distance in an autorickshaw, you may have to shell out over ₹100. The NMMC should make this facility available at every nook and corner of Navi Mumbai.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-good-response-navi-mumbai-to-add-100-more-rental-cycle-stands-101630060350383.html
27-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi schools to reopen for higher classes from September 1||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday announced that schools, colleges and education institutes in the city will open in a phased manner from September 1.“The kind of education that can be imparted through physical classes can never be substituted by online classes. So, we have decided to allow schools to open. From September 1, all government schools will open for classes 9 to 12, all private schools can also resume classes for 9 to 12 standards and coaching centres can also start classes for students of 9 to 12 standards. All colleges and university classes can also resume in Delhi from September 1,” said Sisodia,also the education minister, in a press conference at the Delhi secretariat.Earlier today, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) held a meeting in which the decision was taken, following which a senior DDMA official said that the authority has also given a green signal to the government to allow classes 6 to 8 to re-open from September 8.Sisodia said that the government will closely observe the situation for at least one week after allowing classes 9 to 12 to resume from September 1 before deciding on reopening for other classes.Stressing on consent of parents as a mandatory requirement for students to attend physical classes, Sisodia said, “Online classes will continue too. Students can also attend from home. Parents’ consent is a must. No student can be forced to attend physical classes. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) will be issued in the next few days. Schools have to ensure social distancing in class rooms.”Also Watch | Eye on Punjab polls, Kejriwal picks Sonu Sood as face for Delhi initiative“In five states so far, schools have resumed for all classes. In around a dozen states, schools have resumed for classes 6 to 12. We too conducted a survey in which 70% respondents were in favour of reopening of schools,” he said.He added that 98% of staff – both teaching and non-teaching – in Delhi’s schools have taken at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine. “In the last month, we organised special drives to vaccinate teachers and school staff. Around 98% teacher and other staff in government schools have taken at least one dose of vaccine. Private schools also told the government that the majority of staff is vaccinated,” said Sisodia.The government did not share figures of teachers who are fully vaccinated.Physical classes at Delhi schools have been suspended since March last year in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Higher classes reopened for a brief period between January and March this year but were suspended again during the fourth wave of the pandemic in Delhi which coincided with the country’s second wave.Dr Jacob John, former head of the clinical virology department at Christian Medical College in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore, said: “The SOPs have to be chalked out meticulously, especially because vaccination of children is yet to begin in the country. The government could actually have started with a few schools and then taken a call on all schools. Ensuring social distancing and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is a must. Also, the government must ensure that not just school staff but all family members of the students attending physical classes are vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-schools-to-reopen-for-higher-classes-from-september-1-101630060228727.html
27-08-2021||Mumbai||Vaccination drive for teachers to be held by Thane district administration||Thane district administration will organise a special vaccination drive for teachers and non-teaching staff from government and private schools within the district on Friday and Saturday, officials said.The district health department and education department within Thane district are preparing a list of teachers who have been vaccinated. Based on the number of staff yet to be vaccinated, the health department will make provisions for vaccination at the centre nearest to their school.On Friday and Saturday, all staff that have not got vaccinated can show their official identity card and get vaccinated at government vaccination centres. Provisions for the same will also be made by the health department with a focus on rural areas as well.“We are reaching out to each school to get a list of staff yet to be vaccinated. We will ensure that teachers get vaccinated and are provided with the second shot as well, based on schedule so that they get fully vaccinated at the earliest,” said Sheshrao Bade, education officer, Zilla Parishad.Meanwhile, Ajay Jadhav, district information officer, said, “As schools across the district may open soon, collector Rajesh Narvekar has given orders to ensure teachers and non-teaching staff are vaccinated at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-drive-for-teachers-to-be-held-by-thane-district-administration-101630059389992.html
27-08-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai bound lane of Mumbra bypass might soon be closed for traffic||Barely two weeks after restrictions on the Thane-bound lane of the Mumbra Bypass Road were lifted following repairs, potholes have now started appearing on the opposite lane of the busy road. The authorities are currently in discussion to impose similar restrictions on this lane shortly, officials said.According to the Thane traffic police, the Public Works Department (PWD) had communicated to them earlier this month that repair work will need to be started as soon as possible on the Retibunder Bridge stretch of the road.“The PWD has informed us that several potholes have formed on the Navi Mumbai bound lane of the bridge, and need to be repaired before they get any bigger. However, the problem is that pothole repair work is already underway in Kharegaon currently which is causing major traffic jams daily. If, on top of this, we impose restrictions on the Mumbra Bypass road, the traffic problems will multiply,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Balasaheb Patil, Thane Police said.Patil added that the situation at Kharegaon is worse than the current condition of the Mumbra Bypass Road as new potholes are practically appearing as fast as the older ones are being repaired. Combined with the ongoing monsoons, this has become a nightmare for the traffic police.“The PWD is still in the process of appointing a contractor for the repair work at the Mumbra Bypass Road and the work in Kharegaon is also being conducted as fast as possible. Both these processes are expected to get completed in around 10 to 12 days, after which we will take a call on imposing restrictions on the Mumbra Bypass Road,” Patil said.When contacted, S Totawar, executive engineer, PWD, confirmed the development and said, “We are in talks with the Thane traffic police regarding the imposition of restrictions on the Navi Mumbai bound lane of the Retibandar bridge so that potholes can be repaired quickly. The specifics of this process are still under discussion.”On July 29 this year, a five-foot deep crater had formed on the Thane bound lane of the crucial road, with the road under the bridge being visible through the crater. The PWD had started repair work on the crater the same day and movement of heavy vehicles was banned on the lane for the duration of the work. These restrictions stayed in place for several days after the repair work was complete, to allow the newly poured concrete to be set properly. The movement of heavy vehicles was only restarted on the lane on August 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-bound-lane-of-mumbra-bypass-might-soon-be-closed-for-traffic-101630057890287.html
27-08-2021||Dehradun||Germplasm of over 27k plants collected from Uttarakhand so far||The National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) Regional centre Bhowali in Kumaon has collected germplasm of over 27,000 plants in the form of seeds and saplings under its initiative to document and preserve the agro-biodiversity of the Himalayan state, officials said. The germplasm of plant varieties that have been collected so far include cereals, pseudo-cereals, millets, minor millets, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables, spices, condiments, medicinal plants, aromatic plants, wild relatives of crops and fruits and ornamental crops Mamta Arya, in charge of NBPGR regional centre Bhowali in Nainital district, said, during various explorations in the state so far, they have collected germplasm of over 27000 plants, including 200 varieties of rice and over 800 varieties of wheat found in the state. “The main aim of collecting the germplasm is to protect and preserve the agro-biodiversity found in the Himalayan state. Suppose, if some variety goes extinct, we can again bring it back from the germplasm we have collected so far,” she said. Arya said that germplasm is collected in two forms. “In case of plants whose seeds can be stored for a long time, we collect seeds, like in case of stony fruits like plums, almonds and so on. However, in the case of plants, where seeds cannot be collected, we collect live plants in our field gene banks. One sample we store here and another is sent to the national gene bank located at New Delhi,” she said, adding, that so far, germplasm of over 4.5 lakh plants has been collected from across the country. Arya emphasised that the germplasm collection will help in protecting the traditional and wild species crops and fruits found in the state. “Based on our collection and knowing the characteristics of these plants, we can also make suggestions to the farmers on various aspects and also encourage them to grow exotic plants like aromatic plants. Lakhs of seedlings and cuttings of promising aromatic crops like Rose Geranium (Pelargonium graveolens), Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), Lavender (Lavendula angustifolia), Sweet Marjoram (Marjorana hortensis), Caraway (Carum carvii), China Pati (Artemisia annua), Lemon grass (Cymbopogon flexuosus) have been provided to growers and farmers so far,” she said. She said they have also created an inventory and established agro-techniques for growing ten rare, threatened, endemic, endangered and commercially important plant species. “These ten species include Acorus calamus (Bach), Coleus forskohlii (Patharchoor), Curcuma zedoaria (Karchoor), Hedychium spicatum (Spiked ginger lilly), Lavendula angustifolia (Lavender), Pelargonium graveolens (Rose geranium), Piper retrofractum (Chabya), Pistacia integerrima (Kakarsingi), Valeriana jatamansi (Indian Valerian), Zanthoxylum armatum (Timoor),” she said. According to the website, the NBPGR has its headquarters in New Delhi. The bureau draws guidelines from the Crop Science Division of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research, Institute Management Committee, Research Advisory Committee, Institute Research Council and Germplasm Advisory Committees. The bureau has 10 regional stations located in different phytogeographical zones of the country, including Bhowali in Nainital district. The Bhowali centre was established in 1985 and is responsible for the exploration, characterization, evaluation and multiplication of agri-horticultural crops of the state’s sub-tropical and sub-temperate regions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/germplasm-of-over-27k-plants-collected-from-uttarakhand-so-far-101630056209178.html
27-08-2021||Dehradun||Mahakumbh Covid testing scam: 2 Uttarakhand officials suspended||Uttarakhand government has suspended two officers in the Mahakumbh fake Covid testing scam for “indiscipline, carelessness and colluding with the private firms” concerned, thus incurring financial loss to the state exchequer. The suspended officers are Dr Arjun Singh Sengar, then mela health officer (state health department), and Dr NK Tyagi, then in-charge officer (state health department), Kumbh Mela, said the government statement on Thursday evening. The action comes in the wake of the report from the district level probe committee on August 14. The Mahakumbh fake Covid testing scam came to light in June when a Faridkot resident complained to the authorities that he received a message for collecting his Covid-19 report despite never having been tested. The complaint triggered a probe in nearly 100,000 Covid tests conducted during the Kumbh. On June 17, Haridwar police booked Max Corporate Services, and two private labs -- Nalva Lab of Hissar and Lalchandani Lab of Delhi -- in connection with the scam.Also Read | AAP protests against BJP by making ‘jalebis of false promises’ in U’khandOn June 18, Haridwar police formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to assist the investigation in the cases registered in connection with the scam. The four-month Mela was curtailed this year to one month (April 1-30) but devotees thronged Haridwar for months despite experts saying rampant violation of Covid protocol could spark a surge in infections. Roughly 9.1 million pilgrims took the holy dip in the Ganga from January 14 to April 27, including at least six million people in April, coinciding with the worst surge in the second wave of the pandemic. The Mahakumbh coincided with a major spike in Covid cases in Uttarakhand. Between April 1 and April 30, the active cases rose from 2,236 to 55,743, while the total cases during the same period soared from 100, 911 to 180,521. The Mahakumbh is held every 12 years between Makar Sankranti, which usually falls on the second weekend of January, and Chaitra Poornima, which is celebrated in the last week of April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/mahakumbh-covid-testing-scam-2-uttarakhand-officials-suspended-101630055848801.html
27-08-2021||Chandigarh||AICC Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat seeks to be relieved||Citing next year’s assembly elections in Uttarakhand where he is the Congress campaign committee chairman, Harish Rawat has sought to be relieved as the in-charge of party affairs in Punjab. He said that to concentrate on the upcoming elections in Uttarakhand, it had been on his mind to seek to be relieved of the responsibility of the party’s Punjab affairs in-charge. Also read: Latest from Kabul airport: Death toll from attack rises, evacuations continue“Yes, this is the reason,” the former Uttarakhand chief minister told reporters in Dehradun on Thursday when asked if he has sought to be relieved of the charge as Punjab affairs in-charge so that he could concentrate on the polls in his state. He added that he would abide by whatever direction is given to him by the party. “If my party asks me to continue (as Punjab affairs in-charge), I will continue,” said Rawat. Punjab and Uttarakhand go to the polls next year. Says elections to be fought under Capt While the Congress is seeking to retain power in Punjab, it aims to return to power by defeating the ruling BJP in the hill state. Punjab is witnessing infighting between the camps of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. Rawat, who is in Delhi to meet the party’s senior leadership, has reiterated that the 2022 Punjab elections will be fought under the leadership of Capt Amarinder Singh, delivering a snub to the leaders wanting his removal. Rawat also said that there was no threat to the Amarinder Singh-led government. Reiterates Sidhu free to decide within norms Reacting to Sidhu’s statement urging the party high command to allow him the freedom to take decisions, Rawat said party chiefs are free to take decisions within the party’s norms and constitution. “I will see the context in which Navjot Singh Sidhu has made these remarks. Mr Sidhu is the respected chief of the Punjab unit. Who will have the power to take decisions if not the state presidents?” he told reporters in Delhi on Friday. Rawat added state presidents are free to take decisions within the party’s constitution and position. Sidhu had said earlier that the party high command should give him the freedom to take decisions and he will ensure that the Congress remains in power for the next 20 years. He said he has prepared a roadmap in this regard. “The party high command should allow me the freedom to take decisions, else I will give a befitting reply,” he said at a meeting in Amritsar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aicc-punjab-affairs-in-charge-harish-rawat-seeks-to-be-relieved-101630055068207.html
27-08-2021||Kolkata||Bengal professors' body questions rationale behind 'drinking poison' by teachers||An association college and university professors of West Bengal on Thursday claimed that the alleged suicide bid by five contractual primary school teachers was part of a conspiracy to foment trouble.Five female contractual teachers allegedly consumed poison on Tuesday while demonstrating before the state education department headquarters in Kolkata, demanding regularisation of services and revocation of transfer orders.West Bengal College and University Professors Association (WBCUPA) President Krishnakali Basu told a press meet that it is unbecoming on the part of a true teacher, "that too involved in children's education", to carry a bottle of poison during a demonstration and "it was part of a conspiracy to foment trouble".Asked whether anyone could take life risk just to foment trouble, Basu said, "The entire episode is unfortunate. Bringing out poison-filled bottles during a democratic movement and drinking it cannot be termed as peaceful by no logic. They could have given prior notice to the education minister for talks, but they did not do it."Also Read | In Bengal, teachers consume poison in bid to prevent transfers to far-flung areasWishing speedy recovery of the five teachers, associated with state-run Sishu Siksha Kendra (SSK), the WBCUPA chief said, without elaborating, there was reason to believe that the five were instigated."So far I know the government has done a lot for regularisation of contractual primary school teachers and raised their wages and provided other financial benefits... They should not have raked up personal issues like transfer during the protest.

People in these vehicles got off and ran to safety. Senior officials rushed to the site and the traffic between Dehradun and Rishikesh has now been diverted through Nepali Farm. No casualties have been reported yet.Dehradun has been witnessing heavy rains for the past few days due to which there has been a rise in the water level of rivers and some parts have got waterlogged and flooded. Uttarakhand Police, tweeting about the accident, said, “Part of Rani Pokhri bridge on Dehradun-Rishikesh highway has collapsed due to heavy rains and flow of current. People are advised not to use this route.”Dinesh Sindhwal, assistant engineer, Rishikesh Public Works Department said bridge was built in 1964. “Over 20 metre stretch of the bridge collapsed due to fast and heavy flow of water in the river due to incessant rain in Dehradun district over the last few days,” he said. A stretch of Sahastradwar- Maal Devta road also caved in due to heavy rains. Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami inspected the area and instructed the officials to repair the damaged road stretch at the earliest.

27-08-2021||Patna||Bihar STF arrests 9 people linked to illegal firearms manufacturing||The illegal firearms industry has moved from the badlands of Munger in Bihar to Uttar Pradesh. The matter came to light when the Bihar special task force, with the help of UP police, raided two locations in Mau and unearthed illegal firearms manufacturing unit, officials said. The police also arrested nine people, including three women, said to be residents of Munger district. Police said that Munger region has long been known for the manufacture of illegal firearms over the last few decades. The illegal activities, however, have slowly shifted to UP and West Bengal due to the crackdown. Those arrested were identified as Mohammad Tanvir Alam, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohammad Rizaul Haque, Mohammad Khalid Ansari, Mohammad Liyakat Ali, Mohammad Parvez Alam, Sabana Khatoon, Rubina Ansari and Shabnam Bano (wife of Tanvir). An FIR has been registered at the Kotwali police station in Mau district against the accused on the charges o allegedly running an illegal firearms manufacturing unit. All of them have been sent to judicial custody. A cache of finished and unfinished arms, a large stock of machinery and raw material needed for the manufacturing arms and ammunition, besides machinery used in manufacturing the weapons, were seized. Additional director general (operation) Sushil M Khopde said that acting on a tip-off, Bihar police contacted its counterparts and raided two locations in Mau and arrested them. The police also recovered .32 bore pistol, .315 bore pistol, unfinished 31 pistols of 7.65 mm, 24 pistols bodies, 354 barrels, eight dye machines, 99 raw materials, three electronic welding machines, 95 slider, five drill machines, two laptops and 235 iron frames. During the investigation, the police found that Taverz and his brother Tanvir got married in Mau. Both of them settled there and were involved in arms smuggling and manufacturing. Tanvir was already facing an arms act case in Mau since 2011. Police said the preliminary investigation brought to the fore that the weapons were manufactured at the Mau’s unit and were being sent to Munger for final finishing. Khopde admitted that following the recovery of illegal weapon consignments in any part of the country, the needle of suspicion always invariably points to Munger, but many a time it is not established. “We are trying to identify their contacts and customers,” he added. In another operation, with the arrest of one Mohammad Khurshid Alam of Munger, the STF unearthed a minigun and illegal liquor factory at Morkahi police station area of Khagaria district. Police seized five pistol sets, five live cartridges, four drill machines, one leth machine, magazine farma, 12 barrels, gas cylinder, country-made liquor and utensils.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-stf-carries-out-raids-in-mau-arrests-9-people-linked-to-illegal-firearms-manufacturing-101630053269635.html
27-08-2021||Patna||Bihar plans post-graduate teaching in every district||After going ahead with its plan to open higher secondary schools in every panchayat and degree college in every sub-division, the Bihar government now plans to go ahead with its move to start post-graduate teaching in at least one college in each district.The move comes in view of growing demand and the need to boost the gross enrolment ratio (GER), which continues to be very low in the state at 14.4, nearly half of the national average.Education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary said that the government would welcome such proposals from interested colleges if they are routed through the concerned universities with their recommendation and give them go ahead on a priority basis.Choudhary said that chief minister Nitish Kumar’s focus was on increasing the GER in higher education and therefore, the government worked in a planned manner to phase-wise scale up educational institutions, starting with the opening of higher secondary schools in every panchayat and degree colleges in every sub-division. “The results are now coming and at least one post-graduate college in every district will be in tune with the progress. There have been a lot of demands in this regard to the CM as well as the education department,” he added.The minister said that the department got proposals from two districts for starting PG education - one at BSS College (Supaul) and another at KKM College (Jamui). “We have decided to give approval. There are 10 districts where PG teaching is not available in any college. If the proposals come from the remaining eight districts through a proper channel, we will certainly like to approve them. With incentives, girls’ enrolment has increased manifold at the secondary, higher secondary and graduation level and they need institutions nearby to go further,“ he added.However, it will not be easy considering the fewer number of colleges per lakh population in the state, huge vacancies, poor NAAC grading due to lack of proper infrastructure, teaching and research, and high enrolment of students, which results in a lack of academic atmosphere on campuses. The shortage of teachers is particularly acute in places away from main towns and the efforts to rope in guest teachers in accordance with the UGC guidelines has not been very successful. Besides, the academic sessions continue to be late in most universities. Even in the universities where PG teaching is on, the semester system is not fully in place despite UGC guidelines, while at the undergraduate level, it is totally missing in state universities. As per the 2019 report of the All India Survey for higher education (AISHE), Bihar still has just seven colleges per lakh population with an average enrolment of 1703, while the number of colleges per lakh population in Andhra Pradesh is 51, 59 in Karnataka, 48 in Kerala, 37 in Rajasthan, 34 in Maharashtra, 31 in Gujarat and UP and 30 in West Bengal with much lower average enrolment.The minister said that those colleges where Honours level education was on and the teacher-pupil ratio was 1:30 could start PG teaching. “For further creation of posts at the PG level, the government will go by the recommendation of the competent authority,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-plans-post-graduate-teaching-in-every-district-101630052549126.html
27-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi Airport has seen gradual growth in passenger traffic, says report||Delhi Airport has seen a gradual growth in passenger numbers in line with the recovery in air travel demand, as around 90,000 passengers travelled per day through the facility during the first 10 days of this month, according to a White Paper by GMR.This is five times more than the mid-May passenger volumes when Delhi Airport handled around 18,000 travellers per day. The number by the end of June 2021 increased to about 62,000 passengers per day, the White Paper released on Friday said.According to GMR, with the improvement in the Covid-19 situation and the high level of vaccinations being achieved, domestic traffic is expected to reach the pre-Covid level by the end of FY23. However, given the situation, international traffic could attain pre-Covid levels only by FY24.In July, the airport handled around 2.29 million passengers, which is 60 per cent less than the 5.80 million passengers handled in the same month in 2019. Similarly, air traffic movements in July were also 45 per cent less at 20,800 compared to 37,700 services operated in July 2019, as per the White Paper.Once the severe impact of the second COVID wave eased, people felt the need to travel to their respective homes/base locations, thereby Visiting Family and Relatives (VFR) travel has pushed up the passenger numbers, according to the White Paper, which also observed a slight pickup in business travel demand (with the gradual opening of offices)."But it is still very much subdued. The leisure travel (tourists) has also picked up, with the opening of tourist destinations across the country," it said.The government allowing airline companies to operate up to 72.5 per cent of their total domestic capacity also resulted in a gradual increase in passenger traffic. From June, the government started relaxing capacity from 50 per cent to current levels of 72.5 per cent, GMR said in the White Paper.This came following the lowering down of impact of the Covid-19 second wave and to safeguard aviation industries’ viability battling with weak finances. The increased capacity, complemented with the opening of new routes, allowed airlines to manage increased passenger numbers, it said.With the arrival of the festive season, Delhi Airport witnessed positive traction in domestic travel. There is a propensity to travel with the increase in total vaccinations across the country, but it is, of course, contingent on the emergence of the third wave of Covid-19, GMR said."We may see the adoption of a common travel pass based on vaccination and testing status for International travel in coming months. However, it is too early to comment on the resumption of scheduled International travel in the next three months," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-airport-has-seen-gradual-growth-in-passenger-traffic-says-report-101630052060386.html

Urging more people to join the initiative, Kejriwal said, “No one can stop India from becoming a global leader if people join the education revolution.”Sood said, “We have seen the model of governance in Delhi and how the whole school system has witnessed immense growth under that model. It is an honour for me to be the ambassador for such an initiative. There are thousands of school children who are talented but not privileged enough to have guidance, especially at a time when people have started looking beyond medical and engineering studies as the only two major choices. The recent lockdown and the hardships faced by people during the lockdowns highlighted the importance of education of children and the need to help them shape up their careers.”Also Read | Swine flu, dengue cases rise in Delhi; doctors say no need to panicOn being asked, Sood said he doesn’t have any plans to join any political party though he will actively continue with his social work even as he praised Kejriwal and the Delhi model of governance.Kejriwal said, “We had a chat for nearly two hours today and such interactions are beyond politics.

The duo received grievous injuries on their face and chest. While Kulamani succumbed to the death on the spot, Dibyasingh died while undergoing treatment at the SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack the next morning. Baral was allegedly raising his voice against the alleged involvement of BJD leaders in the appropriation of PMAY houses meant for poor peopleFollowing FIR by Baral’s son, police had booked law minister Pratap Jena and 12 others in the case. The body of Prafulla Biswal, the prime accused in the case, was found on a road in Tangi area more than a month later under mysterious circumstances.After the police dropped the law minister’s name from the chargesheet, Biswal’s son had lodged a complaint case against the law minister before the JMFC alleging that the investigation done was perfunctory as police completely overlooked the allegation against Jena.Baral’s son Ramakanta, who filed the case, alleged that even when the law minister’s name was in the FIR and his statement under section 161 Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C) the investigating officer did not examine material witnesses and wrongly recorded the statement of witnesses to shield him.The police investigating officer in his charge-sheet had said that the Call Detail Records of all the accused persons were verified regarding receipt of any calls from Pratap Jena but there were no such calls.However, citing the SC judgement on Vinubhai Haribhai Malaviya vs The State of Gujarat (Criminal Appeal Nos. 478-479 of 2017), in which the apex court said, “the ultimate aim of all investigation and inquiry, whether by the police or by the magistrate is to ensure that those who have actually committed a crime are correctly booked,” the JMFC said it is the magistrate who has to decide whether on the basis of the record and documents produced, an offence is made out or not.“It is the judicial conscience of the magistrate which has to be satisfied with reference to the record and the documents placed before him by the investigating agency, in coming to the appropriate conclusion in consonance with the principles of law. It will be a travesty of justice, if the court cannot be permitted to direct “further investigation” to clear its doubt and to order the investigating agency to further substantiate its charge-sheet,” the JMFC order said.While BJP leader and senior advocate Pitambar Acharya demanded that Jena should resign in light of the court’s observation, the law minister refused to comment on the court order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-police-asked-to-reinvestigate-after-minister-s-name-allegedly-dropped-from-chargesheet-101630035208727.html
27-08-2021||Delhi||Swine flu, dengue cases rise in Delhi; doctors say no need to panic||With the change in weather in the national capital, hospitals in Delhi have been witnessing a sudden spike in seasonal flu, swine flu and dengue cases in the last few days. An official survey shows that as many as 41 per cent of households in the national capital were surveyed wherein one or more members of the family were suffering from flu-like symptoms. Till July 31, only two cases of swine flu were reported in Delhi. The number has increased to 60 within just four weeks till August 25."Most of the cases are normal flu cases. The symptoms are typically in upper and lower respiratory tract related symptoms. Many a time, when we have done the flow panel for the patients or when we have done swine flu test, we have found that at least 2 per cent to 3 per cent of patients coming up positive with swine flu reports," Dr Ashish Khattar, a senior consultant of internal medicine at Venkateshwar Hospital, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Dr Khattar said that this time the crowd has increased in several areas and hence such cases have gone up. "It happens every year. But, this time, the frequency and the number of cases are much more. One reason is that there is a sudden surge of an outbreak of crowds outside. There has been a lot of footfall at the marketplaces, the hospital OPDs are full, people are probably not following the Covid-19 behaviour norms and there is barely any social distancing norm being practised, as per my observation," he added.Experts say that flu doesn't have very serious consequences but those who have comorbid conditions need to be careful. "It doesn't lead to very serious consequences. In most of the cases, unless you have underlying comorbid conditions, most of the times the patient would have just cough cold, fever, body aches, headache, runny nose, sneezing as complex symptoms," Dr MS Kanwar of Apollo Hospitals' department of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine told ANI.Dr Rommel Tickoo, the director of internal medicine at Max Healthcare, said that many patients are coming to the hospital with flu-like symptoms, high fever, body ache, cough and cold and most of them are recovering in five to seven days with symptomatic treatments.Dr Tickoo added that people should not panic and should take all the required precautionary measures to protect themselves. "Swine flu symptoms are similar to those of Covid-19. However, there is no need to panic. But, yes you have to get tested for Covid-19. Almost everyone is recovering without any hospitalisation nowadays. We still have to take precautions. Follow Covid-19 protocols by wearing the masks, stay away from crowded places etc," he said.Dengue cases have also started going up in the Capital and so far Delhi has reported 82 patients this year. Out of these, 32 cases have come in the last one month. According to the data of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, 30 cases of dengue have been reported in the national capital in the last 23 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/swine-flu-dengue-cases-rise-in-delhi-doctors-say-no-need-to-panic-101630030976478.html

I am a Union minister, MP from Bihar and LJP’s part president. It is the duty of the administration to provide proper security to me,” Paras was quoted as saying by news agency ANI on Thursday. He also wrote to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar regarding his security concerns.Also Read| Auto lubricant thrown on LJP’s Pashupati Kumar Paras during Hajipur visitThe Union minister added that he and LJP leader Keshav Singh were being threatened over messages and phone calls, adding that some other leaders of the party were also receiving threats. “I and my party leaders also received filthy abuses and threats on our mobile phones,” Paras told ANI.Without naming anyone, Paras said his political rivals were ‘jolted’ by the massive public response he got during his visit to Hajipur on Monday and accused them of resorting to “murderous politics” as a part of a conspiracy. He also alleged that the Bihar Police did not follow proper security protocols during the visit.Pashupati Kumar Paras, who is the younger brother of late Union minister and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan, has been at loggerheads with Paswan’s son Chirag over the leadership of the party. In June, Paras was unanimously elected as leader of the LJP in the Lok Sabha, after five of the six MPs of the party joined hands against Chirag Paswan and elected Paras in his place.Meanwhile, Chirag has also been on a tour across Bihar to rally support around his leadership.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/days-after-hajipur-incident-pashupati-kumar-paras-requests-z-plus-security-101630029355006.html

From next time, we are going to attach your properties and will start with attaching your commissioner’s office,” the bench said.North MCD counsel Divya Prakash Pande said the the proposal to hand over its hospitals to either the Centre or the Delhi government has been rejected by the councillors.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing Delhi government, said the second installment of grant-in-aid (GIA) and basic tax assignment (BTA) has been released to the three corporations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-tells-civic-body-to-pay-its-doctors-101630021170129.html

27-08-2021||Chandigarh||Right of accused to speedy trial can’t be denied by filing challans one after another: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that in a case where trial has substantially progressed after filing of chargesheet, a supplementary challan against other accused cannot be attached with the main case and de novo (fresh) joint trial cannot be ordered where serious “prejudice” will be caused to those already charge-sheeted. “The accused has the fundamental right to speedy trial. To hold otherwise will not only put the progress of the trial entirely in the hands of the police and the prosecution by enabling them to delay trial by filing police report/challan against the accused one after the other or the accused by enabling them to adopt the dilatory tactics of surrender by one or more of the accused but also denude the trial court of the requisite control on the progress of the trial and will also involve denial of fundamental right of one or more of accused to speedy trial,” the bench of justice Arun Kumar Tyagi said while allowing an appeal in a criminal case. The high court was hearing an appeal filed in March in an attempt to murder and kidnapping case registered by Sangrur police in May 2018. One of the accused, Gurmail Singh, had approached the high court seeking directions to the trial court to conclude the trial in a time-bound manner. The accused was behind the bars since June 2018. The police filed a challan in September 2018 and supplementary challan was presented against two more accused in November 2018. Prosecution evidence was concluded. But in January 2019, two more accused joined investigation and the police filed another chargesheet in March 2020. The trial court passed an order of attachment of supplementary chargseheet of March 2020 with the main case even as examination of witness by the defence was already over. Feeling aggrieved, he had urged the HC to issue direction for speedy and separate trial. The high court observed that Section 223 of the CrPC permits that a joint trial may be held but leaves it to court’s discretion to order joint or separate trial. In exercise of the discretion, the court has to take into consideration the stage at which the already pending trial has reached and also whether any inconvenience or prejudice will be caused to the accused already charge-sheeted in case a joint trial is ordered, the bench observed. “It has now become a general practice that the police, instead of conducting investigation into the offences committed at one time and taking steps for ascertaining complete facts and circumstances, make piecemeal investigation and keep on arresting the accused and filing police report/challan against them one after the other for years together,” the HC observed, adding that the trial courts follow the course by attaching supplementary challans filed against accused without any application of mind. The bench allowed the plea and quashed the trial court’s February 25 order whereby attachment of chargesheet orders with main case were passed. The court also ordered that the copy of the judgment be sent to all district and sessions judges in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh for information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/right-of-accused-to-speedy-trial-can-t-be-denied-by-filing-challans-one-after-another-hc-101630009704064.html

Members of the Bhartiya Kisan union (Ekta-Ugrahan) on Thursday staged a protest against Sharma as he visited Ludhiana to attend a meeting with party leaders at Circuit House. The protesting farmers marching towards the Circuit House were stopped by police near Verka plant on Ferozepur road. This came a day after the protesting farmers gheraoed Sharma during a meeting in Jalandhar. “The BJP leaders have every right to hold meetings in the state.

Chugh, who is in-charge of the J&K BJP unit and BJP’s J&K chief Ravinder Raina welcomed retired IGP, CRPF, Sudhir Singh Dogra, Col (retd) Gurbaksh Singh and Amrit Kour to the BJP. Chugh said the BJP government at the Centre was committed to the development and safety of J&K,” he said, adding that the PM has also promised early polls in J&K. Condemning former CM Mehbooba for “anti-national utterances”, Chugh said, “It was J&K’s misfortune that these dynasties ruined development in the region and whenever the public solicited a response, they started speaking the language of China and Pakistan.” Cong should come clean on remarks made by Sidhu’s advisers He also said the statements made by Sidhu’s advisers were similar to what Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and Pakistan Army chief General Q J Bajwa have been telling India.“The Congress should clarify its stand on the statement of its Punjab unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu’s advisors on social media platforms that India has occupied Kashmir. This is a seven-decade-long narrative of Pakistan,” Chugh. Ravinder Raina said, “Parties like the National Conference, Congress and PDP enjoyed the privileges of the power corridors, but did nothing to empower democracy at grass roots level.

27-08-2021||Chandigarh||Feud has hurt us, need local panel to sort it out: Partap Bajwa||The party high command had lots of expectations from Navjot Singh Sidhu. They had this feeling that his being made the party president will strengthen the party in Punjab. But, unfortunately, things have moved in a different direction. Navjot’s mandate was to work with chief minister (Capt Amarinder Singh) to fulfil pending promises. Punjabis are agitated over the 2015 Bargari sacrilege, and related firing incidents in Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan. The Congress and the CM had promised to take action. People want that those who were ruling at that time should be held responsible. Also, whosoever is responsible for drugs should face action. On the directions of the high court, two investigations were done. I will appeal to the chief justice of Punjab and Haryana high court to take cognisance of inquiry reports lying in sealed envelopes with the court and open these so that people know who the culprits are.It is the high court that had ordered these probes. The government should have taken cognisance, but the responsibility for opening the sealed reports lies at the doorstep of the honourable high court. What was the idea of getting investigations done if these were not to be made public. Then, there are lots of other issues, such as power purchase agreements (PPAs). The government must bring white paper and do something on it. We must give him some more time. He is like a younger brother to me. A number of people wanted to be the PCC chief. In his elevation, the rights of even those who have been in the party for more than 40 years were overlooked. In spite of that he has got this opportunity and important responsibility. He needs to work with the government. When he recently met the CM who decided to make one minister sit at the Congress Bhawan in Chandigarh for a couple of hours daily to hear the workers and a 10-member group was set up, it was a good beginning. We must work on those lines. Just 3-4 months ago, the Congress was in a much better position. People wanted to give the Congress a second chance. It is now up to the leaders to sit together as issues can be sorted out. For instance, the cane farmers were on the verge of creating another Singhu border in Jalandhar. I was called by the CM. We sat together and called different organisations and, in one go, gave the farmers ₹50 per quintal more for sugarcane. Today, we have the highest state-assisted price. There are other issues related to SC scholarships, regularisation of contractual employees and pay hike. The state in-charge (Rawat) should come immediately and make everyone, including the CM and ministers, sit together. He should also rope in a couple of senior party leaders from Punjab. In fact, we should have a panel of two-three leaders from Punjab to mediate honestly and remove irritants so that things can be sorted out issue by issue. This group should play the role of United Nations. We really need neutral interlocutors who have the confidence of both (Sidhu and Amarinder). We should not let things go completely out of hand. We should go to the polls as one and not seen as different camps. If that happens, we would be responsible for the fate that awaits the Congress. Damage has been done but it is still not beyond repair. Leadership issues can be decided after the elections. Similar things had happened between Harcharan Singh Brar and Mrs (Rajinder Kaur) Bhattal in 1996 and repercussions are known to all.Differences crop up even in families…among brothers. You need others in the family to mediate sometimes. There is nothing wrong with that.I would not like to say anything on this as this is the prerogative of the high command which has already issued a statement that the party will fight elections under Capt Amarinder Singh. Then, they (disgruntled ministers and MLAs) should not make such demands publicly. They should have spoken to Mr Rawat in confidence. There were lots of reservations about having Navjot (Sidhu) as the PCC chief, but once Mrs (Sonia) Gandhi announced, everybody accepted it. I am myself completely surprised what has gone wrong as for four-and-a-half years they were at the helm of affairs. They themselves say they still have the best portfolios. Their writ is running not just in Majha but in the whole of Punjab. And, nothing has happened till date which is contrary to their expectations.I will not like to say anything that adds fuel to this fire. I will rather want this fire to be extinguished. I have been told Mr Rawat will be here in a day’s time. If he is here, we have to work together to make things better. I will also try to somehow play a role, the way I did for the sugarcane farmers. We have to find ways to sort out the emotive issues such as drugs, Bargari sacrilege and police firing, and take action against those responsible.The major thing is what was the role of Badals and (then DGP Sumedh Singh) Saini.There is a new SIT now. We just need it to come up with the final report. These are certain issues that are agitating the minds of most Punjabis who want clear answers.As the party president, Sidhu can take anyone’s advice. Once you give formal orders that advice or view is taken as the viewpoint of the party. I will appeal to Sidhu that he is occupying a very responsible position and we are in a border state, so he needs to take control of his office. Their (advisers’) views cannot be contrary to the Congress’ stated position and the national view. Otherwise, this (controversial statements) will have serious repercussions, not only in Punjab but also in other states going to polls. Already, BJP’s national president (JP Nadda) has raked up these things. We have to be very careful.I am not in his camp. My support to him is issue-based. I am burying the hatchet with him as a Congressman. If I don’t set an example, then things are over. You know what is waiting for us in 2022. Then, it is writing on the wall. I am not in any camp. I am with the party high command. We should focus on how we can win the upcoming polls. As a Congressman, I have a future ahead. The Congressmen are riding in the same bus. If it meets with a mishap, we all will suffer. Our main concern should be to reach our destination. Who will be the driver and conductor can be decided by the bus owner (high command) thereafter.Yes, one hundred and ten per cent. I am also alarmed at how this situation is being created. I could have easily added fuel to fire. If we also do that, the whole house would be on fire. The basic strength of SAD was the BJP, which is no more with them. And, the role that Akalis played in farm bills initially, they are still to overcome that. Farmers are still very much angry with them. The AAP has wagons with them but no engine without which no train can reach its destination. To date, the Congress has the engine, wagons, fuel and can reach its destination. All we need is an alignment of the engine and wagons in place.Whoever is the CM is the engine at this moment. To change and replace someone is the high command’s prerogative. Yesterday, Harish Rawat has stated that we will go to polls under Capt Amarinder. As senior persons, responsibility lies on our shoulders to facilitate things to bring everyone together. My role will be that of fire extinguisher.I am going to contest the assembly election, preferably from Gurdaspur district. I have already spoken to the Congress president, Rahul Gandhi and the state leadership.I want to tell him that we are all in a hurry. We are senior to him. Every person has to wait for his turn. We are very much in the race for everything. Staying in the race by making a positive contribution is one thing and setting everything on fire is something else.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/feud-has-hurt-us-need-local-panel-to-sort-it-out-partap-bajwa-101630008750569.html
27-08-2021||Chandigarh||‘No-means-no’ campaign against hydel projects resounds across Kinnaur||A fortnight after a massive landslide killed 28 people near Nigulsari village in Himachal Pradesh’s Kinnaur, the ‘no-means-no’ slogan rang loud and clear across the rugged terrains of the tribal district as thousands of people rallied against hydel power projects on Thursday. The ‘no-means-no’ campaign, which is steadily gaining popularity in the mountain valley, was launched by the youth of the region after recent landslides in Batseri and Nigulseri areas. A major demonstration was held at the district headquarters, Reckong Peo, under the joint aegis of local organisations such as Himlok Jagriti Manch, District Forest Adhikar Sangharsh Samiti, Jangi Thopan Powari Prabhavitt Sangharsh Samiti and Hangrang Sangharsh Samiti. Agitating locals demanded that all proposed hydroelectric projects in the Sutlej River valley be cancelled. Roshan Lal Negi of Jangi Sangharsh Samiti said, “We have held numerous discussions with the administration, government and scientists on the effects of the proposed 804 MW Jangi Thopan power project, to no avail. Scientists have termed the disasters as ‘natural calamities’ as opposed to ‘man-made disasters’ on the behest of the government to give the hydel projects a clean chit.” “The area where the Jangi Thopan project will be setup falls in active land-sliding zone and tampering with the local landscape will prove fatal for the people of the area,” he said. Another activist, Shanta Kumar Negi of Hangrang Sangharsh Samiti, said the authorities were using labels such as ‘anti-national’ to intimidate environmentalists and locals opposing the hydel projects. “However, we live in a remote area and our constitution gives special rights to tribal areas,” he said. “The capitalist model has not only flagged off a blind race for profiteering, but also widened economic inequality in the country,” Manshi Asher of the Himdhara Collective, adding that under this model private companies have dominance and political parties act as their agents. “Our resources are being privatised on a large scale, which is benefitting a handful of companies, while the public is losing out,” she added. Guman Singh and Jia Lal Negi of Himalaya Policy Campaign and District Forest Rights Committee, respectively, highlighted the faulty implementation of the Forest Rights Act in the tribal areas of Himachal. Both, the Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas Act and FRA give people of tribal areas legal rights over water, and forest land. Zila Parishad member Priya said the Kinnaur movement is a fight for the rights of tribal people. As many as 44 people were killed in landslides in Kinnaur this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nomeansno-campaign-against-hydel-projects-resounds-across-kinnaur-101630008684813.html
27-08-2021||Chandigarh||Safeguards for mega monetisation plan’s success||The ambitious ₹6-lakh crore “National Monetisation Pipeline” programme unveiled by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has triggered the lively debate in the political as well as academic circles. She has been at pains to underscore that the ownership of the underlying underutilised assets would continue to vest with the central government or its entities. What would be transferred to the private sector, after transparent and competitive bidding, would only be the limited right to manage or operate these assets, for a predetermined finite period. The BJP as a political party has never been shy of using the word ‘privatisation’, although the term ‘disinvestment’ has been frequently preferred. In fact, this chimes very well with the citizen-friendly slogan of “minimum government, maximum governance”, often stated by the Prime Minister himself. The political rhetoric by the opposition parties has essentially been confined to the allegation of “selling the family silver” — built up arduously by the successive governments out of taxpayers’ hard-earned money — to crony capitalists. The economists and academicians opposing this scheme conceptually have pointed out that the government may get only a fraction of the replacement value of capital cost, its upfront receipts being confined to the NPV (Net Present Value) of the expected income stream, after duly adjusting for the risk premium and inflation. The Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, has, on the other hand, defended the initiative stating that these receipts, expected to be received over the next four years, would be utilised for additional capital expenditure by the central government, thereby triggering a benefic multiplier effect in the economy. A part of this amount may also be applied to retire the burgeoning debt burden of the central exchequer. Of course, there are then the usual arguments about the efficiency gains through better managerial practices of the private sector as compared to the outdated bureaucratic mode of handling things by the “babus” in the public sector. Given the type of contracts which the government is often wont to sign and given the quality of its legal teams, it is not too difficult to visualise a scenario where the winner of the bid might default in the payment and yet continue to operate the asset and earn income from it. The astronomical AGR dues that the telecom giants have piled up is merely an illustration of this apprehension. We thus delineate the following points to ensure that this ambitious programme not only succeeds but also achieves its predetermined objectives, which like in many other policies of the government, are often not clearly predefined. 1. The field should be thrown open to global players and 100% FDI should be allowed. If only the domestic players are made eligible, they will merely dip into the gross investable pool created by the Indian economy and would necessarily be at the cost of other projects that they or the smaller players might have undertaken. 2. Since most of the assets proposed to be monetised are virtually natural monopolies, we need to have truly independent statutory “regulators” in place to ensure not only the quality of the service to be provided but also provide a safeguard that the customer/citizen is not made to pay exorbitant user-charges through his nose. 3. Since the government ministries/departments tend to work in silos and most of these assets would lie within the domain of the respective ministries, different practices might emerge in handling the monetisation process. Thus, a separate department or ministry, working in tandem with the administrative departments, needs to be created to ensure not only uniformity in the process but also cross-pollinating the ideas emerging from the monetisation process in different sectors. 4. Close monitoring of the physical and financial parameters committed by the private operator must be ensured so that we don’t land up with a situation where the problem becomes intractable, before the government really wakes up to the gravity of the situation. Maybe a separate mission, manned by professionals, needs to be created. 5. Since the private player should bear a bulk of the payment risk, the banks in general and the public sector ones in particular should not be forced to lend to the entities who do end up coming out as successful bidders. 6. Lastly, in any case of wilful default, severe penal and criminal action should be expeditiously initiated and carried to its logical conclusion. If these precautions are interwoven into the entire scheme at the initial stage itself, we may well see this ambitious programme succeeding, with the concomitant benefits to the economy in general and the central government finances in particular. Bereft of these, the entire scheme may just potentially be a recipe for a mega-scam or non-performing assets in the hands of the already stressed public sector banks. kbs.sidhu@gmail.com(The writer recently superannuated as 1984-batch IAS officer of Punjab cadre.

Thakur said the prices had fallen last year as well after private players fixed the prices of the apple in the market, despite 2020 being an off year.“The government has failed to control private companies and apple markets despite the bitter experience of last year,” he alleged, adding that a major private company had procured apples from the growers at the rate of ₹ 88 per kg, while this time they had dropped the prices to of ₹ 72 per kg.The company reduced the prices of apples by 20% through market manipulation, he alleged adding that such practices were prevalent despite the Centre claiming that it will double the farmers’ income by 2020.Thakur sought the intervention of chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and asked the government to negotiate with the private company.The former Jubbal-Kotkhai MLA Thakur said that the government has also failed to control the prices of apple packing material.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/apple-prices-have-fallen-due-to-lack-of-government-intervention-ex-cong-mla-rohit-thakur-101630008323283.html

On Wednesday, conservation architect Abha Narain Lambah, who is working with the JSW Foundation, briefed lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha about the work being undertaken by the team for preservation and restoration of the gardens.Shalimar Bagh is the largest Mughal garden in Kashmir. It was built by Emperor Jahangir for his wife Noor Jahan in 1619, on the bank of Dal Lake. It is in close proximity of the terraced Nishat Bagh, which was built in 1633 by Asif Khan. In March 2020, the Jammu and Kashmir government appointed Lambah, who runs an architectural conservation firm, to prepare a dossier to enlist prominent tourist spots of Kashmir as UNESCO world heritage sites. Lambah’s firm has won nine UNESCO Asia Pacific Awards for conservation projects.On July 28, the J&K government had inked an MoU with the JSW Foundation, which is the social arm of multinational conglomerate JSW Group, for restoration and conservation of the gardens. The foundation is providing both financial and technical support for preserving the two heritage gardens under corporate social responsibility. The work will be completed in two phases and will approximately cost around ₹7 crore per garden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/restoration-of-2-mughal-gardens-kicks-off-in-valley-101630008143955.html

And also along the roadside.It is like a pavement cafe opening up for the day in Paris. But this is Asaf Ali Marg in central Delhi. Soon enough the brief stretch will teem with notary clerks preparing legal documents for their clients, who might have to submit those to the nearby ‘Office of the Sub-Registrar.’This open-air shrine to paperwork is extraordinarily quaint because every single notary here works on an old-fashioned typewriter. Each one’s booth comprises of a table and a chair. A passerby might easily imagine these busy typists as a bunch of writers in a class of creative writing course.Such notaries are seen in many parts of the city, but the early morning assembling of their (metaphoric) cubicles here in Asaf Ali Marg, is intensely evocative. At this hour, the corridor is empty. The middle-aged Vasudev Bhagat (see photo) is bringing out the chairs and the tables, one by one, from a warehouse nearby, where he keeps them for the night. “This has been my job for 15 years,” he says, informing that about 25 notaries sit in the corridor daily. Mr Bhagat’s young assistant, Vijay, emerges out of the warehouse carrying a notary clerk’s old battered briefcase, with sheaves of paper sticking out of it. The boy keeps the briefcase on a table stained with marks of blue ink. Looking around with weary eyes, Mr Bhagat slowly walks back to the warehouse and reappears with a knotted cloth-bundle on his shoulder. It’s looking like a gathri in which one packs the household laundry that has to be ironed. But this gathri is packed with a typewriter, Mr Bhagat says. All the typewriters are in similar bundles.The clerks will show up by 9. Within an hour, the corridor will start to resound with the clack-clack of their typewriters. For the moment, a thin barefoot man is sleeping on the dusty ground, by a row of tables; a pair of bricks is serving as his pillow.The work wounds up by 5 in the evening when Mr Bhagat and Vijay lug back the tables and typewriters.

Rawat’s directive to Sidhu came a day after four disgruntled Punjab ministers and several party MLAs met him in Dehradun seeking chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s removal. “I have verbally communicated to the PPCC chief to remove them (two advisers), making it clear that if he fails to do so, I will have to issue a written direction,” Rawat told Hindustan Times. Rawat’s ultimatum, ostensibly at the behest of the party high command, on Sidhu’s hand-picked aides Malwinder Singh Mali and Pyare Lal Garg is a setback for PCC chief who has so far kept a studied silence on their remarks, particularly Mali’s relentless swipes at Capt Amarinder Singh. Asked about Mali’s clarification that these were his “personal views”, Rawat said that his remarks were totally unacceptable, and no clarification was sufficient. “The Congress has nothing to do with him. He is not our appointee. He is not even a primary member of the Congress. On sensitive issues like Kashmir having national and international repercussions, the party will not accept any statement that is at variance with its view,” he added. 55 MLAs show up at dinner with CaptBuoyed by Rawat’s assertion on Wednesday that Amarinder will lead the party in the next assembly elections, the Captain camp hosted a dinner for MLAs and MPs on Thursday as a show of strength to counter the detractors’ claim of a brewing revolt against chief minister. Earlier in the day, three of the four dissenting ministers skipped the virtual meeting of the cabinet chaired by the chief minister. The absentees were rural development and panchayats minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, jails and cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and water resources minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria. Over 55 party ministers and MLAs, besides eight MPs, attended the dinner where chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh was also present, according to sources. The dinner was hosted by sports and youth affairs minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, a close confidant of Amarinder, at his official residence here. “We had invited like-minded MLAs and MPs. All those who were invited turned up and reaffirmed their faith in the chief minister’s leadership. We will win the 2022 assembly elections under him,” Sodhi told Hindustan Times. Sidhu and ministers and MLAs close to him were not seen there. Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, who was to sit at Punjab Congress Bhawan to redress the grievances of party workers and public as per the roster, also did not show up at the headquarters. Randhawa said he had a family engagement and could not participate in the meeting. Bajwa and Sarkaria did not respond to calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rawat-tells-sidhu-to-axe-two-advisers-capt-camp-shows-strength-at-dinner-101630007967319.html
27-08-2021||Chandigarh||16 years on, J&K’s CIC operators’ services still not regularised||Despite a government-empowered committee clearing the regularisation of 172 community information centre (CIC) operators in 2017, the operators continue to work on a contractual basis 16 years on. The revocation of special status under Article 370 of J&K by the Centre in 2019 and the reorganisation of the state into two union territories has further impeded the regularisation of these operators as the J&K Civil Services (Special Provisions) Act 2010, under which they were to be regularised, stands repealed under home ministry’s order in 2020.The operators, working in the UT’s rural development department (RDD) and handling all the online work like e-gram-swaraj, swachh bharat mission (SBM), pradhan mantri awas yojana (PMAY-G), peoples plan campaign (sabki yojna sabkavikaas), gram panchayat development plans (GPDP), mission antyodaya , public financial management system (PFMS) and other e-governance related activities, have been drawing a monthly remuneration of mere ₹10,000. They say that they have also been performing all other office assignments related to elections, establishment, accounts, and works at block, district and directorate level.Operators, with degrees like MCA, M Tech, MSc, IT, BE and BTech, say that most of them have become over-aged for government jobs and have been running from pillar to post for their regularisation.The CIC operators were recruited on contractual basis in 2004 on merit basis through open competition conducted through district-level appointment committees constituted by the government in every district. In 2016, Jammu and Kashmir government through its cabinet decision created posts of data-entry operators for regularisation of their services and a year later in 2017 the empowered committee of J&K government headed by principal secretary, finance department, J&K, cleared their cases for regularisation under the J&K Civil Services Special Provision Act, 2010. The operators said that the department of law, justice and parliamentary affairs has given their opinion in favour of them as has the advocate general of J&K. “All the codal formalities for our regularisation have been completed by the J&K government but unfortunately the regularisation orders are not issued,” said Siddiqui.He said that after much delay and back and forth on formalities, the rural development department was advised by the general administration department (GAD) in June, 2021 to put the cases of the CIC operators before the establishment and selection committee of Jammu & Kashmir again.“The process will take years altogether and almost all the incumbents have crossed the age of 45 years and above,” he said.Mir Mushtaq, a CIC operator from south Kashmir who has masters in computer application, said that the fresh directions by the government meant that things have to start afresh. “The start of the process of regularisation once again nullifies all the work of past years. This is sheer injustice, nothing else,” Mushtaq said.“We are all suffering ,as are our families. I have three school going children. I am not able to pay their fees,” he said.This month, the government has asked the directors of the rural development department (RDD) in both the divisions to furnish the details of the cases under focus.“A case with regard to regularisation under above said repealed act ( J&K Civil Services Special Provisions Act) was referred to law department for opinion which advised that for considering any accrued right under repealed legislation shall be decided by the competent authority for which the matter shall be placed before the establishment cum selection committee,” said Javaid Ahmad Reshi, deputy secretary in rural development department quoting a communication from general administration department. “Accordingly all the administrative departments have been requested to furnish details of pending regularization cases under the repealed act,” it asked the directors of Jammu and Kashmir divisions.Repeated calls to secretary department of rural development Rifat Arif and director of Kashmir division Tariq Ahmad Zargar elicited no response. Additional secretary GAD, Shabir Hussain’s mobile was switched off.“We sympathise with them. They have been working with this department for a long. But what can be done in the changed circumstances. The list has already been provided to the GAD,” an official at the directorate of rural department said, on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/16-years-on-j-k-s-cic-operators-services-still-not-regularised-101630007725132.html

He was speaking at a roundtable conference on road safety and socio-economic assessment of national highways in Punjab organised by Institute for Development and Communication in Sector 38 on Thursday. Gupta said, “Traffic cops are the face of the police who interact with the public on a daily basis. There are only eight traffic cops in Punjab per 1 lakh people, which is still higher than the national average.”The DGP also spoke about how the same people who follow all traffic rules in Chandigarh adopt a casual approach when they enter Punjab. He said the Punjab Police are now using equipment such as traffic enforcement cameras to monitor vehicles’ speed in cities. Punjab’s Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) (traffic) SS Chauhan discussed how techniques such as predictive analysis can be employed to manage traffic in a better way. Talking about road safety assessment of national highways in Punjab, state’s traffic adviser Navdeep Asija said, “Accidental death rate on the patch of NH 152 that passes through Mohali is 2.15 deaths per kilometre, five times higher than the state and national average. Most of the pedestrians were killed when they were walking along the road rather than trying to cross it. Maximum accidents were caused by cars and the highest number of mishaps were recorded on Saturdays, when people tend to venture out in their cars and the volume of transport vehicles is lower.” He also mentioned how most of the fatalities were caused between 6pm and midnight. Asija added that 45% of 175-km stretch of NH 44 has been declared as black spot and the highest rate of fatalities is in Ludhiana and Fatehgarh Sahib due to the industrial nature of these districts.The socio-economic impact of NH 44 was also discussed by Shuchi Kapuria, who showed how schools close to the highway have higher enrolment rates, especially in higher classes, and also how more crimes are also witnessed close to the highways.Deputy director of Institute for Development and Communication, Chandan Awasthi, speaking on the sideline of the event, said this research was prepared by the traffic psychology unit recently formed by their institute and will be used to spread awareness among those living close to the national highways in Punjab as well as the first responders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/check-on-speed-can-reduce-accidents-by-half-in-punjab-dgp-101630006523805.html

It has been delayed on account of the design to be selected, choice of the agency to complete the project, model for its implementation and no firm turning up to implement it. The initial decision of the engineering department to go for stainless steel bus shelters had elicited criticism from different quarters, particularly architects and heritage protection groups. It had even installed 60 stainless steel bus shelters in 2013 at a cost of around ₹8 crore, with each shelter costing about ₹13 lakh. Critics opined that concrete shelters could be constructed at half of this cost. The design and material of the steel shelters also didn’t go along with the original design of the concrete shelters which was in line with overall architectural plan of the city, critics had said. Under pressure, the department had in 2017 reversed its decision and decided to opt for structures made of concrete on the lines of the original bus queue shelters in the city. Model concrete design to be followed“We will follow the design of the model concrete shelter constructed between Sectors 17 and 18. This will be replicated across the city now for new construction and refurbishment of old structures,” Ojha said. The department’s plan to implement the project on ‘built operate and transfer’ (BOT) model couldn’t be realised. Under the model, the firm was to construct the shelters, maintain them and in return could generate revenue from advertisement. The department floated tenders six times, but could get the requisite response. Notably, one firm even approached the Punjab and Haryana high court over some tender-related issues. “There was apprehension among the firms that due to the pandemic, they would not be able to generate enough revenue to cover the cost of construction and management of the bus queue shelters. So, the response to our tenders remained subdued,” Ojha added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-to-build-209-new-bus-queue-shelters-in-9-months-101630006044064.html

27-08-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana: School found running ‘illegally’, officials under HC lens||The high court has asked the Haryana government as to why action not be taken against the officials who allowed a private school to function in Panchkula without recognition.The high court bench of chief justice RS Jha and justice Arun Palli acted on the plea of a Panchkula resident, Manish Kumar Banger. Banger had told court that he had filed a plea against Sky World School, Panchkula, for running Classes 9 and 10 without obtaining necessary recognition. He alleged that after the plea was filed in 2020, his children were forced to leave the school without any refund of fee. The petitioner further stated that the permission granted to the school in July 2019 was conditional with a clear stipulation that it would not admit students till recognition is granted. Though the authorities had taken note of this fact, no penal action was taken against the school and the matter was closed by issuing a warning, it was alleged. The petitioner had referred to a high court judgment, wherein directions were given that no school be allowed to function in violation of the provisions of the Haryana School Education Act, 1995. According to another high court ruling cited by Banger, all such schools were ordered to refund fee to all students and the government was asked to take penal action too. It was further submitted that the school is playing with the future of children, as it has been granting admissions illegally and extracting hefty fees. Banger’s counsel Abhinav Aggarwal had told court that the authorities have passed the warning order in absolute ignorance of law. They have manipulated the record and have ensured that petitioner would not be granted time or opportunity to represent his case before them, by issuing notice to him just a day before the hearing, the court was told, adding that an appropriate action be taken against the school as well as against the officials involved. The government counsel had admitted that the permission granted in July 2019 was conditional, and had further sought time to file an affidavit about the steps taken by the authorities against the unrecognised school and the fact that how the school in question was allowed to continue to run Classes 9 and 10 in the absence of recognition. The court has now asked as to why steps be not taken against officials and also asked the state government to apprise the court about the steps taken by the authorities to prohibit this school as well as other similarly situated unrecognised schools from granting admissions to students. The state has been told to file a response by September 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-school-found-running-illegally-officials-under-hc-lens-101630005923835.html

He asked police to begin relaying warnings by blaring hooters before 10 pm every night. To note, the state government withdrew the Sunday closure, that meant the end of all kinds of Covid restrictions, barring the night curfew (10 pm to 6 am every day) in the state. At the Covid-19 review meeting, Yogi said: “We need to be extra cautious as Covid cases have begun rising sharply in several states once again. It is very important that Covid protocols are followed well. The night curfew should be made effective. Police teams should begin issuing warning and alerts by sounding hooters ahead of 10 pm every night, nudging people to not roam around unnecessarily and shopkeepers to shut shops by 10 pm.” Talking about the state’s current Covid status, Yogi said that the policy of ‘trace, test, track and vaccinate’ worked well in the state and helped control the pandemic. The state had done 7.12 crore tests, the highest so far among all states and by August 25, UP administered 6.60 crore Covid vaccination doses. “The second wave of the pandemic in the state is in control. In the past 24 hours, of the 2.16 lakh tests done, not a single case of fresh infection was reported in as many as 60 districts. Statewide only 19 fresh Covid cases were reported and not a single person died of Covid in the past 24 hours. Active cases, at present, are 342,” he said. . Yogi said that the daily positivity rate in the state was 0.01% and the overall recovery rate was 98.6%. Yogi called the Agra hooch tragedy unfortunate and said that local officers concerned would be made accountable for the incident. He asked for intensification of the drive against spurious and unauthorised liquor in the state. Yogi also asked the state railway police to be alert, as two incidents of loot on trains were reported from two different parts of the state. Asking the officers concerned to not let such incidents happen again, he directed them to be in constant touch with the Railway Protection Force (RPF).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-covid-death-in-up-in-24-hours-cm-101630004124077.html

27-08-2021||Mumbai||Congress leader’s murder: Mumbai court rejects plea for inquiry against CBI prosecutor||charul.shah@htlive.comA special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court has rejected the plea filed by former corporator Mohan Shukla – an accused in Congress leader Pawanraje Nimbalkar’s murder case – for preserving CCTV footages of the lobby of a five-star hotel in Mumbai, alleging that the central agency’s prosecutor had stayed at the hotel where bookings were made by the victim’s son.Nimbalkar was shot dead at Navi Mumbai in 2006.Shukla had claimed that the Nimbalkar family had been influencing the trial, and it was only due to their pressure that one of the accused had turned approver. Shukla had also pleaded that the deposition of the approver be deferred till the time an appropriate inquiry is made into the CBI prosecutor’s stay at the five-star hotel. In his plea, Shukla had claimed that on April 5, the prosecution examined the approver before the court and his evidence was recorded. Further examination of the approver was scheduled for the next day. After the court hearing, when he went to a five-star hotel to discuss the case with his lawyer, he was shocked to see the special public prosecutor in the hotel lobby with the victim’s son.He alleged that the trial in the case was “being conducted by CBI through its public prosecutor solely on the instructions of the victim’s sons – Jai Prakash and (Shiv Sena Member of Parliament) Om Prakash – which is nothing short of a coup being played upon to falsely implicate all the accused.” The court rejected his pleas after finding that it contained “vague” allegations. “It is seen that though the application has been filed on affidavit, no material has been placed on record in support of the application. However, it appears that accused No 3 [Shukla] is trying to collect the evidence at the hands of this court,” the special court said in its order, rejecting Shukla’s plea.The court also rejected Shukla’s allegations that an accused had agreed to become approver under pressure. “Can’t consider plea for nod to die by suicide”The special CBI court also rejected a plea by Pintu Singh Choudhary – another accused in the case – seeking permission to end his life in prison as he was suffering from anxiety due to the “protracted trial and inordinate incarceration”. Choudhary – one of Nimbalkar’s alleged shooters – had written to the court to either transfer him to Siwan Central Jail in Bihar, where he has a case pending trial or conduct the trial in the murder case on day-to-day basis or allow him to end his life by his own consent. He claimed that he had been languishing in the prison for the past 12 years, thereby violating his right to speedy trial. He further alleged that he is very frustrated and his non-production in the court is causing severe anxiety to him, making him suicidal as his family is completely ruined due to his long incarceration. The plea was opposed by prosecution on the grounds that he cannot be transferred to Bihar as it will hamper the probe. Instead, the prosecution suggested: “The court may direct Arthur Road Jail authorities to refer the accused to the medical board to take such steps to ensure that the mental condition of the accused remain stable and that the jail authorities may be directed to keep a close surveillance/watch on the activities of the accused, so that he does not harm himself by taking any adverse steps.” The court, while rejecting his plea, observed that due to second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, his further examination-in-chief could not be recorded till today. The courts in Mumbai have now started functioning regularly and the prosecution is also ready to conduct the trial on a day-to-day basis. Further, the court said his prayer to die by suicide cannot be considered and is liable to be rejected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-leader-s-murder-mumbai-court-rejects-plea-for-inquiry-against-cbi-prosecutor-101630004006117.html

Soon after the SAD-BSP comes to power after the 2022 assembly elections, action will also be taken against the officials involved in this,” said Dhillon.Earlier on Tuesday, a group of 20 bitumen contractors announced that they will boycott the road construction works in the city citing alleged corruption in MC while allotting of contracts.The mayor had refuted the allegations and accused the contractors of trying to blackmail the MC for allotment of contracts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/congress-resorting-to-corruption-to-raise-election-fund-sad-101630003587910.html

The finding comes amid the municipal corporation’s claims that the firm had installed fewer streetlights than what was mentioned in the contract. The firm submitted its report to mayor Balkar Sandhu’s office on Thursday.The report is based on joint inspections conducted by MC and the company officials in 93 wards of the city. The survey is still pending in two wards including, ward number 67, which is represented by councillor Mamta Ashu and ward number 94, represented by Gurpreet Singh. The mayor stated that he is waiting for the MC officials’ report to cross-check the data.Suspecting that the company had installed fewer streetlights than the agreed number in the contract, mayor Balkar Sandhu had ordered a survey after a meeting with councillors. The councillors had sought action against the company and accused it of fraud. As per sources, over 150 streetlights were found missing even in mayor Sandhu’s ward. On the other hand, some wards had more lights than what was listed in the MC data. Sandhu, however, refused to disclose the details of the report. He said a complete report will be disclosed after the MC officials submit their report and the data is cross-checked. The officials stated that the mayor will be conducting a meeting with the MC and Tata company officials in this regard on Friday. Residents, councillors raise hue and cry over defunct streetlightsEven as the MC is conducting surveys to find out the number of missing streetlights in the city, residents and councillors are raising a hue and cry over the defunct LED streetlights in the city. Citing security concerns, the residents rued that the lights installed on the streets and main roads remain non-functional most of the time, despite repeated complaints submitted to the civic body and the private company concerned.Non-functional streetlights can be seen at different points in the city including Model Town, Gol market, Shingar Cinema Road, Model Town Extension, Field Ganj, and Haibowal, among other areas.Amarjit Singh, president of Model Town market association, said, “A certain number of streetlights remain non-functional most of the time as maintenance teams deployed by the private company tasked with the job visit the area after a week. It puts the safety of residents and shops at risk as the area becomes pitch dark after sunset. The MC should take corrective steps to bring some relief from the problem.”The councillors rued that the issue was also raised during the general house meetings of MC in the past but to no avail. Leader of opposition in the MC general house Harbhajan Singh Dang said, “The working of the company involved in installation and maintenance of LED streetlights is very poor, and we have also demanded that the MC should terminate the contract with the company. We will again take up the matter with the mayor as the councillors and public have to bear the brunt for the failure of the company.” Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “Apart from conducting a survey on missing streetlights in the city, we have also directed the company to improve its functioning in terms of maintenance of the streetlights. If the company fails to do so, action will be taken against it after discussing the matter with the councillors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/streetlights-at-over-900-points-in-ludhiana-missing-as-per-tata-company-s-survey-report-submitted-to-mayor-101630003585743.html

27-08-2021||Mumbai||Tussle between Governor Koshyari and Maharashtra govt yet to end?||The tussle between Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra VIkas Aghadi (MVA) government is yet to end. A meeting between a delegation of MVA leaders, led by the chief minister (CM) and the governor could not be held on Thursday as the latter refused to give an appointment to MVA leaders, state Congress chief Nana Patole has alleged.“The meeting could not be held as the governor didn’t give an appointment,” Patole told reporters. Thackeray, along with deputy CM and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar and revenue minister from the Congress Balsaheb Thorat, wanted to meet Koshyari to discuss the issue over not clearing the 12 names for the legislative Council. The list of names, approved by the state cabinet, is pending with the governor for the past nine months. “The BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) will face a major rift if the 12 MLCs (Members of legislative Council) are appointed. The fear within the BJP has delayed the appointment for the vacant seats of the legislative Council,” Patole alleged.However, officials from Raj Bhavan clarified that the government communicated over the meeting only after 4pm, as a result of which the governor said a meeting would not be possible on Thursday due to his prior appointments. The meeting is likely to be held on or after September 1 as Koshyari will be visiting Delhi on Friday to attend the launch of his biography the next day and will come back to Mumbai only next month.The book, ‘Bhartiya Sansad Mein Bhagat Singh Koshyari’, will be launched by defence minister Rajnath Singh. According to the Raj Bhavan officials, Koshyari will visit Dehradun after the book launch.Late on Thursday evening, Thackeray’s close aide and Shiv Sena secretary Milind Narvekar visited Raj Bhavan to meet the governor. Koshyari is believed to have informed Narvekar about his schedule for the next five days.Narvekar didn’t respond to calls and text messages.Most of the seats in the Council have been vacant since last June. The state had approved the names of 12 MLCs in November 2020 to be nominated by the governor for six-year tenure. The appointments are made by the governor based on the state cabinet’s recommendation.The list submitted to the governor included the names of Vijay Karanjkar, Urmila Matondkar, Nitin Bangude-Patil and Chandrakant Raghuvanshi from the Shiv Sena; Eknath Khadse, Raju Shetti, Yashpal Bhinge and Anand Shinde from NCP; and Rajni Patil, Sachin Sawant, Anniruddha Vankar and Muzaffar Hussain from the Congress. The inaction by the governor was challenged before the Bombay high court (HC).On August 13, HC had said that the governor is constitutionally obligated to either accept or reject the names within a reasonable time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/tussle-between-governor-koshyari-and-maharashtra-govt-yet-to-end-101630003463646.html

We will write to the governor to hold back the Bill and not forward it to the President for assent,” he said.The former CM said BJP-JJP want to run the government only by event management and advertisements.Hooda said the state has no representation in the Bhakra Beas Management Board for the past one year. “If we do not have any representative in the board, how will Haryana get its due share of water?” he said.He criticised the state government for misleading people on deaths due to oxygen shortage. “The height of insensitivity is that government is lying to cover up the truth. The government misled people of the state, the House and the Centre,” he said.He said leaking of question papers has become an unfortunate tradition in this government. “The HPSC and HSSC have been reduced to shops of government jobs. Some people have been caught from Pulwama in the paper leak case,” Hooda said.“This crime has now become an inter-state matter and thus, a CBI inquiry is necessary under the supervision of a sitting judge.

27-08-2021||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray going far from BJP and closer to Congress-led coalition?||Barely three months ago, speculation of reunion of the Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena in Maharashtra was rife, following a half-an-hour-long one-on-one meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. The latter had led a state delegation to seek the Centre’s intervention in restoring Maratha quota and other issues on June 8. “Wait and watch!” said a few state BJP leaders after the meeting, pointing out that the Sena was a natural ally of the BJP and nothing could be ruled out. Thackeray, however, had something else on his mind. On August 20, he participated in a meeting of chief ministers of opposition parties and opposition leaders called by Congress president Sonia Gandhi. In this virtual meeting, Thackeray even made a case for a proper strategy to work together, so that people would be convinced that the opposition coalition meant business and the parties were not together only for contesting the elections. Within four days, Thackeray’s government arrested Narayan Rane, a member of Prime Minister Modi’s cabinet, over a case related to a remark passed by him against the chief minister. The message seems to be clear: Thackeray is not keen to go back to the NDA camp, he is not a pushover and he is ready to take on the BJP. The bitterness between the two parties that were together in Maharashtra for over 25 years began in 2014, after the BJP won power at the Centre with a thumping victory. They still came together after the 2014 elections, but parted ways over the issue of chief ministership even, after winning the 2019 elections as an alliance. Thackeray went with traditional rivals such as the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to form the government. Since then, a bitter political tussle is on between the Sena and the BJP. Ahead of the elections to municipal corporations and district councils, the BJP made its intention clear when it inducted Rane—Thackeray’s biggest critic—as a Union minister. It wanted to target Sena stronghold in Mumbai and Konkan. Rane who spent more than two decades of his political life in the Sena and knows the organization inside out, is expected to counter the Sena and cut it to size. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is a weak point of the Sena as it derives its power and strength from its control over Mumbai. Wresting the BMC from the Sena would deal a severe blow to the party. Knowing this well, the BJP has been planning its strategy and Rane is expected to be a key player in it. Thackeray has struck at the first opportunity, which has sent a signal to his former ally and also galvanized his cadre which loves such atmosphere. “It is not the first time that Thackeray and Sena have targeted the BJP. They did it on several occasions since 2014, but this time, it is different. Arresting a minister in Modi government is a direct challenge to the Centre,” said a senior NCP minister, on condition of anonymity. “The battlelines are clear now,” he added. In the run-up to the local body elections, expect a fierce battle between the two parties. “The BJP won’t take the things lightly and will hit back at the Sena. The bitterness is likely to grow,” the above mentioned minister added. “I think it is impossible that the two parties would come together now. Uddhav Thackeray realised that his political existence was in danger due to the BJP’s growth. That’s why he took a bold decision to form the government with the NCP-Congress. He sees political space in the anti-BJP stand,” opined Surendra Jondhale, a political analyst. Significantly, even as the BJP and Sena were protesting against each other following Rane episode, state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil on Wednesday told mediapersons that he would not rule out any possibility of the BJP and Sena coming together in the future. “We are blood brothers and have a common ideology. Things are not good as of now, but anything can happen,” he said. The Shiv Sena, however, ruled out any truck with the BJP. “The Shiv Sena walked out of the alliance over an ethical issue when a promise was not kept. After that, the behaviour of our former ally continued to hurt us. The way the chief minister was individually targeted (by Rane) has angered us. Our former ally made Rane an instrument to target us. I think the coming together is difficult,” said Sena deputy leader and spokesperson Sachin Ahir. The BJP on Thursday said a reunion with the Sena is not an issue before the party now. “Realignment with the Sena is not a priority issue for us. Our priority is to raise issues concerning people and agitate against the policies of the three-party government that are hurting the common man. As far as political equations are concerned, we are going ahead independently and gaining strength. We defeated the three-party coalition in Pandharpur assembly byelection, which is a clear indication of it,” said state BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-going-far-from-bjp-and-closer-to-congress-led-coalition-101630003103569.html
27-08-2021||Mumbai||Narayan Rane’s arrest: Maharashtra BJP assesses the situation||Although the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has taken a firm stance to support Union Minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Narayan Rane amid their face off with Shiv Sena, the party is treading cautiously over its political stand on the entire episode. The party is expected to take a review of the situation in the backdrop of their recent clashes with Shiv Sena as it fears that it may backfire, especially during Mumbai local body elections if the Uddhav Thackeray-led party succeeds in convincing people that Rane’s remarks meant demeaning the chief minister of the state. After Rane’s remarks kicked up a controversy, state BJP leaders such as Devendra Fadnavis and Maharashtra unit chief Chandrakant Patil wasted no time in clarifying that they do not approve the remarks made by Rane against CM Thackeray, though the party would stand by the Union minister. Patil, however, went a step ahead and said that Sena was still a “blood brother” to them, creating further confusion among the party cadre. Insiders believe that Patil’s remarks were an indication that BJP did not want a full-fledged confrontation with the Sena at this stage. Both Fadnavis and Patil have not met Rane since his arrest on Tuesday. Rane was arrested by Ratangiri Police for his remarks against Thackeray in Mahad on Monday. He had said that had he been present at Mantralaya on August 15, he would have slapped the CM for forgetting the year of the country’s Independence. During his speech on Independence Day, Thackeray had to lean back to ask an official about the year India had attained freedom.“A section of party leaders think that an aggressive leader like Rane will help them in taking on the Shiv Sena in the forthcoming elections and help reap political gain. However, few other leaders do not approve the same as they believe it’s against their culture and the political texture of the party. Secondly, established leaders would definitely not like the shift of the leadership epicentre which could happen if Rane gets sizable response in the state,” said a party leader, requesting anonymity.The party is also wary about a potential backfire of such an aggressive stand and personal attacks on Shiv Sena and its leadership. “Sena’s rank and file get charged up if its leadership or the Marathi pride is hurt. Sena workers taking to the streets and threatening BJP leaders over the past two days has proven it. After a long period, Sainiks got the opportunity to show their original colours by taking to the streets. Such spontaneous response may play against BJP’s political prospects in Mumbai, Thane, Nashik and Dombivli. Taking it into consideration, the party will surely revisit its strategy by holding brainstorming sessions, conducting surveys etc,” another BJP leader said.BJP’s poll in-charge for next year’s BMC elections Atul Bhatkhalkar said that there are no two opinions within the party over supporting the Union minister. “It was a non- issue blown out of proportion by Shiv Sena and the CM. The People of Maharashtra adjudge well over issues and they know this was raked up by the Sena just because their leader was hurt. It was not a protest on any social issues in the interest of the people. BJP never endorses violence or wrong statements, the same goes for our stand on Ranesaheb’s statement. But the party is fully with him in this entire episode,” he said.Bhatkhalkar said that they do not think the Sena has got a chance to energise their cadre. “It is no more (Sena founder) Balasaheb Thackeray’s party which would go to any extent for the sake of the leadership’s call. Uddhav Thackeray is not Balasaheb; Balasaheb had never met Congress leaders or compromised on the ideology. Sainiks adjudge their leadership and the policies, and they fairly know the sincerity of their leadership. How can a Sena worker or even people from Mumbai and Konkan tolerate an attack against a Marathi manoos? We are sure that Ranesaheb’s leadership will help us politically in the forthcoming elections,” he said.Shiv Sena’s Ratangiri-Sindhudurg Member of Parliament (MP) Vinayak Raut said, “Rane has no acceptance even in BJP as key senior leaders are against him over the entire issue. There is unrest among the senior and loyal party leaders over Rane’s standardless politics. People have been watching closely how Rane has been attacking us, and they do not approve this type of behaviour. People in Konkan, including Mumbai, will support Sena as they have been doing for years.”Political analyst Hemant Desai said that BJP would not give Rane a free hand due to various reasons. “In the past two days, [Sena mouthpiece] Saamana has started evoking Marathi and Maharashtra pride as they do for every election. This may turn in their favour and against BJP. Secondly, whatever Rane said is against BJP’s culture and cannot go down well with the party’s middleclass electorate, living in Parle, Dadar, Dombivli. As such, BJP would think twice over its poll strategy ahead of local body elections early next year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/narayan-rane-s-arrest-maharashtra-bjp-assesses-the-situation-101630003043711.html

27-08-2021||Mumbai||Narayan Rane to resume yatra in Maharashtra’s Konkan today||After his arrest for his “slap the CM” remark on Tuesday, Union Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) minister Narayan Rane is expected to resume his Jan Ashirwad Yatra on Friday in Ratnagiri and continue it in Sindhudurg for the next two days before its culmination. Meanwhile, the political slugfest between the Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continued on Thursday amid fresh police complaints and allegations. In response to Rane’s threat to pull skeletons out of cupboards, Sena mouthpiece Saamana said the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government should reinvestigate murders of four political activists in Konkan who happened to be Rane’s rivals. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who chose to remain silent during the slugfest for last three days, taunted Narayan Rane while speaking in a conclave on Thursday. He said that a few viruses have emerged again and they need to be shown their place. Back in Konkan, a new round of clashes is expected during Rane’s yatra in Sindhudurg. The BJP has alleged that the prohibitory orders issued by Sindhudurg collectors, banning assembly of more than five people for two weeks, was an attempt to stall the yatra. “We have been taking legal advice over the prohibitory orders issued by the Sindhudurg collector. Ranesaheb is coming to his home district after becoming a Union minister. Nobody can stop him from meeting people from his constituency. The yatra will begin in Ratnagiri on Friday and will culminate in Sindhudurg on Sunday,” said BJP leader and yatra in-charge Pramod Jathar. Vinayak Raut, Shiv Sena MP from Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg, said the Sena was not against the yatra. “The prohibitory orders are not to stop the yatra. They have been issued in the wake of the high number of Covid-19 cases and such orders were issued time to time in the past one-and-a-half years of the pandemic. The district administration will decide whether to give permission to the yatra,” he said.The BJP has made arrangements for a show of strength. After addressing a couple of meetings in Ratnagiri, Rane will reach Kharepatan, the entry point of Sindhudurg in the evening. Thousands of party workers and his supporters are expected to gather to welcome the minister. Rane was rushed to a private hospital in Mumbai on Thursday for a health check-up after his blood sugar shot up. Rane’s yatra, the outreach programme which kicked off in Mumbai on August 19, was halted after Rane was arrested from Ratnagiri on Tuesday over his remarks against the CM at a press conference in Mahad. The remark led to an uproar among Shiv Sena workers, resulting in multiple FIRs against Rane on Tuesday morning. He was given bail by a district court in Mahad at midnight on Tuesday. Rane rushed back to his Mumbai residence on Wednesday. After the arrest, leaders from both the parties hit out at each other and complaints were filed against their leaders. BJP’s Nashik Central MLA Devyani Farande lodged a complaint with the local police stations against chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for his remarks against Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath in a public meeting in 2018. Thackeray had reportedly said that the UP CM needed to be beaten with chappals for garlanding a photo of king Shivaji while wearing chappals. Similar complaint has been filed against Thackeray in Yavatmal by a BJP worker. Rane had on Wednesday warned to expose Shiv Sena leaders for their corruption and alleged involvement in criminal cases. He had referred to the death case of film industry personality Disha Salian and alleged involvement of a minister in the suicide. “The BJP will take it to its logical end and expose the minister who is involved in it,” he said. Rane also warned the Sena with ‘befitting reply’ for violent protests by Sena workers outside his Juhu residence. In response, an editorial in Saamana said, “Some people claim that Rane was arrested while having lunch. This would not have happened if Rane would have cooperated with the police. This incident was no doubt bad. However, at the same time, the Thackeray Government should investigate who was responsible for killing (political activists) Sridhar Naik, Ramesh Gowekar, Satyavijay Bhise and Ankush Rane,” said an editorial in Saamana. It said though Shiv Sena-BJP have had their differences in the past, it has not escalated to such levels. “Rane’s arrest, the unrest on the roads, fighting between the political workers as well as attack on the offices of the political parties have never been witnessed before in Maharashtra,” said the editorial. BJP legislator Ram Kadam said the editorial reflected the frustration of the Shiv Sena. The BJP has also announced to move court against Sena leader Anil Parab for his orders to police officers to arrest Narayan Rane. They also announced legal action against Sena leader Neelam Gorhe for her political statement despite holding a constitutional post of the deputy chairman of legislative council.

27-08-2021||Lucknow||UP undertakes facelift of major pilgrim towns ahead of 2022 polls||A visit to the Kashi Vishwanath temple through the narrow and slippery lanes of Varanasi had left Mahatma Gandhi in deep pain about 100 years ago.As the Mahatma went to the temple, he saw swarming flies, and stinking rotten flowers greeted him at the entrance there.“I went to the Kashi Vishvanath temple for darshan. I was deeply pained by what I saw there. When practising as a barrister in Bombay in 1891, I had occasion to attend a lecture on ‘Pilgrimage of Kashi’ in the Prarthana Samaj hall. I was therefore prepared for some measure of disappointment. But my actual disappointment was greater than I had bargained for,” observed Mahatma Gandhi in his autobiography My Experiments With Truth while recalling his experiences during his visit to Varanasi. Gandhi further observed, “The approach was through a narrow and slippery lane. Quiet there was none. The swarming flies and the noise made by the shopkeepers and pilgrims were perfectly insufferable. Where one expected an atmosphere of meditation and communion, it was conspicuous by its absence….When I reached the temple, I was greeted at the entrance by a stinking mass of rotten flowers.”Much water has flowed down the Ganga since then. A mega project is underway to give the temple area a facelift.A sum of over ₹1000 crore is being spent on implementation on the facelift projects and the ongoing Kashi Vishwanath corridor is among them. Varanasi is not the only town in focus. A number of other projects are underway for the development of Mathura, Ayodhya, Chitrakoot and the Vindhya region ahead of the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly election.“Uttar Pradesh has a huge potential for the development of tourism. It’s better to explore possibilities of attracting more domestic and international tourists. We have identified 12 circuits, including Ramayana (spots related to Lord Ram), Mahabharata (spots linked to the epic), Krishna (spots linked to Lord Krishna), Buddhist, and Sufi spiritual circuits. We also have freedom movement and eco-tourism (national parks etc) circuits. We are providing basic amenities at the all such spots and trying to make them aesthetically nice,” said Mukesh Meshram, director general, Tourism.Chief secretary RK Tiwari said this would not be just a face lift but would bring about a comprehensive development of these religious cities/towns. He said in the long run this would lead to transformation of these cities/towns and development of the areas around them as well.Union home minister Amit Shah laid the foundation stone of the “Maa Vindhyavasini Corridor” project on August 1 that will come up at a cost of about ₹300 crore in Mirzapur district of eastern Uttar Pradesh. At the instance of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, the state government recently got the Uttar Pradesh Vindhya Dham Teerth Vikas Parishad Bill 2021 passed in the state assembly “to provide high level infrastructure facilities for devotees and tourists visiting Vindhya Dham region, to preserve, develop and maintain the aesthetic quality of cultural, ecological and architectural heritage of Vindhyachal and to coordinate and monitor the implementation of schemes and to develop relevant policies for integrated development of tourism there.”The Uttar Pradesh Shri Chitrakoot Dham Teerth Vikas Parishad Bill 2021 has also been passed “for the preparation of a plan for preserving, developing and maintaining the aesthetic quality of Chitrakoot heritage in all hues — cultural, ecological and architectural; coordinating and monitoring the implementation of such plan and for evolving harmonised policies for integrated tourism development and heritage conservation and management in the region.”The state government got another bill passed to rename the Saharanpur State University, Saharanpur, as Maa Shakumbhari University, Saharanpur, in the recent Monsoon session of the state assembly.The Uttar Pradesh Braj Teerth Vikas Parishad was set up for conservation of culture and development of Braj region in 2017.“The chief minister decided to set up the board for the development of the Braj region. The chief minister is president of the board and chairs its meetings. He has visited the region eight to 10 times in the past four years. A number of projects are being undertaken for development of the area that include the projects being undertaken by the board with an investment of about ₹300 crore,” said Shailja Kant Mishra, a former Indian Police Service (IPS) officer and vice chairman of the board.“It’s a welfare state and the government’s job to work for the welfare of people and provide facilities to them. If the government is carrying out development at religious places and providing facilities to the people, it is bound to get the support of people. Such steps are bound to prove advantageous to the party in power in the elections,” said professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science at Lucknow University.The Opposition is, however, not amused.“Most of the projects, including the work on the Kashi Vishwanath corridor or the development of Mathura and Ayodhya, along with Poorvanchal Expressway, were conceived during the tenure of the Samajwadi Party government. The BJP government has failed to complete such projects and talking about them is only an election stunt,” said Samajwadi Party spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary.Ayodhya has been in focus after the Supreme Court verdict of November 9, 2019, paved the way for construction of the Ram temple. A large number of development projects are being implemented there.A vision document has been worked out for development of the temple town. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently viewed a presentation about the vision document in the presence of Yogi. PM suggested that Ayodhya should be developed in a manner that would put the temple town on the centre stage of the world as a modern city while maintaining its ancient cultural heritage and glory. An international airport is coming up in Ayodhya and the state government recently shifted two PWD divisions to expedite the pace of implementation of various development projects there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-undertakes-facelift-of-major-pilgrim-towns-ahead-of-2022-polls-101630002625101.html
27-08-2021||Mumbai||FYJC first merit list to be out on Friday, cut-offs expected to rise||After much anticipation, the first general merit list for first-year junior college (FYJC) aspirants will be released on Friday. Several minority institutes have already started admitting students for their quota seats including management, minority and in-house quotas, and while the cut-offs have been similar to last year, colleges are expecting higher cut-offs in the general merit list.“Minority quota seats are usually filled up by students out of fear, because for top scorers the main aim is seats in bifocal courses, which are only available in the general merit lists. Even though minority quota lists were similar to last year, high scores of Class 10 students this year will definitely push overall cut-offs,” said Marie Fernandes, principal, St Andrew’s College in Bandra. While cut-offs for science and arts streams remained similar or lower than last year, the demand for seats in the commerce stream at St Andrew’s College witnessed an increase this year compared to last year, she said.At St Xavier’s College, too, the cut-off for the arts course, a popular choice for many, surprisingly dipped by 1.5% in the minority list released last week. Similarly, at RD National College in Bandra, cut-offs for all three streams remained similar to last year, said the principal.While the provisional general merit list was released on August 23, the first general merit list will be released on Friday at 10am. “In 2021-22, common entrance test (CET) was introduced for Class 11 admission. This CET, however, has been cancelled as per a government resolution dated August 11. AS per directions of the Bombay high court, instructions have been given by the education department to start the process of FYJC admission in the state,” said a circular released by the department of secondary and higher secondary education on Friday.This year, Class 10 board exams across several school education boards had to be scrapped due to rising Covid-19 cases. Results for the Class 10 batch was instead based on students’ performance in Class 9 and 10 combined. This decision helped boost marks of students across education boards. While overall success rate of Secondary School Certificate (SSC) students was 99.5% this year, ICSE student in Maharashtra and CBSE students from the Pune region (which includes Mumbai) boasted of a 100% success rate.“Like degree college admissions, all FYJC admission process will also be conducted online only, so we are preparing for an overload of work to be done on Friday. Students are anyway anxious so we want to make sure our staff and teachers are available to guide and help students,” said the principal of a suburban college.Students whose names appear in the first merit list will have time till 6pm on August 30 to complete the admission confirmation process. A list of vacant seats after the first round will be displayed on the admissions website after 10pm on August 30, following which the second merit list is scheduled to be announced on August 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fyjc-first-merit-list-to-be-out-on-friday-cut-offs-expected-to-rise-101630002623767.html
27-08-2021||Delhi||Over 158k vaccine jabs administered in Delhi, most in a day since July 8||Over 158,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses were administered in Delhi on Thursday, the most in a day since July 8, showed data from the Centre’s CoWin dashboard.The city vaccinated 159,037 people on July 8, according to the dashboard.The vaccination drive has picked up pace in the national capital this month, and the number of jabs given in 26 days of August so far has already exceeded the count from July .Over 2.13 million jabs were administered in Delhi in July, and 2.76 million have been given till Thursday evening, an increase despite three public holidays when most inoculation centres were shut — Independence Day, Muharram, Rakshabandhan.More people have also received their first shot of a Covid-19 vaccine in the city this month, with the number of first doses administered being more than double second ones each day last week, August 22, a Sunday that coincided with Rakshabandhan.In July, the government stopped administering first doses for over a week when people who were vaccinated with Covishield in May became eligible for their second shot, leading to the number of second shots overtaking first doses for the first time in the city.The vaccination drive in the city has been intermittently dogged by shortages since being opened up for those between the ages of 18 and 45 on May 1, as state governments and private sector were responsible for purchasing a majority of vaccine doses and at a higher price than the Centre.The policy was later changed June 21 onwards, with the Centre procuring 75% of all vaccine doses manufactured, leaving the other 25% for private sector.This has led to a boost in the vaccination drive, with over 200,000 doses being administered three times in June.Three vaccines are currently available in Delhi — Covishield (which makes up a bulk of the administered shots), Covaxin, and Sputnik V.So far, 9.22 million people or 61% of Delhi’s adult population of around 15 million have received at least one jab of a Covid-19 vaccine. Of these, 3.65 million people have completed the two-dose vaccination regime, meaning almost one in four Delhi residents has been fully immunised against the coronavirus disease.Experts believe this should provide a fairly good protection against the viral infection, with a high proportion of persons also having been exposed to the infection during the severe April-May surge.“A significant proportion of Delhi residents have already been exposed to the virus, especially during the huge April surge in cases. And, many others have now been immunised. Delhi is now in a good situation, even though with the delta variant (which is significantly more transmissible) 90% of the population would have to be immune to achieve herd immunity,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine, Safdarjung hospital.He added, “The vaccination drive should now focus on people who haven’t had the infection.” This can be estimated through population level sero-surveillance to check for presence of antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. Delhi’s seventh round of sero-survey, to be undertaken soon, is likely to provide population level exposure to the virus during the second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-158k-vaccine-jabs-administered-in-delhi-most-in-a-day-since-july-8-101630001363703.html
27-08-2021||Delhi||Cop’s son shoots at man in south Delhi in alleged case of road rage||A 27-year-old man, the son of a Delhi police head constable, shot at a 22-year-old man near the Delhi airport on Wednesday in a case of road rage, police said.Police said the suspect, Nitin Singh, 27, who was allegedly drunk at the time of the incident shot at Sandeep Bhati because he did not allow Singh to overtake his vehicle. Police have arrested Singh, who is a resident of Kalkaji.Police said around 5am on Wednesday, Bhati and his friends were returning to their village in Noida sector 83 from Bhiwadi in his car. “When Bhati and his friends reached near Delhi airport, they noticed one blue colour Swift car behind them. The head lights of the vehicle were switched off. They sensed trouble and increased their speed. The driver of blue car followed them and when they reached RTR Marg in front of Western Air Command Gate, the driver of the alleged car fired at them. The bullet hit the rear windowpane of their car and then Bhati’s head,” said a police officer quoting the statement of the eyewitness, Ashu Bhati, who was travelling in Bhati’s car.Ashu called the 112 police control room number at 5.08pm. Before police could reach the spot, Ashu rushed his friend to the Yatharth Super Speciality hospital in sector 110, Noida. Ashu told police they feared the gunman will shoot at them again and chose to rush to the hospital near their house in Noida.Police said the victim, Bhati is currently admitted to the hospital where doctors are treating him.A senior Delhi police officer, who asked not to be named, said, “Our team went to Noida and record the statement of the eye witness. Based on his statement, we analysed over 50 CCTV cameras between from the crime spot towards south Delhi. The car was spotted in footage of several CCTV cameras on the Outer Ring Road up to Kalkaji. Our investigation showed that the same car had hit a divider an accident in Kalkaji B block. The boot and the bumper of the vehicle were damaged in the accident. We got the car details and took the registration address. It was traced to a house in police colony, Kalkaji.”Police said they found the car to be registered in the name of a woman head constable, Archana Singh. Police said she is posted in the south district. “We arrested Archana’s son after learning that he was using the vehicle. We also recovered the car from a service centre in Okhla. Nitin, the suspect had given it for repairs after the accident at Kalkaji B block,” the officer mentioned above said.Nitin, who was arrested in the early hours of Thursday, told police that he fired the shot because Bhati did not allow him overtake. Nitin also confessed that he was drunk at the time of the incident. Police said Nitin was using an unlicensed pistol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cops-son-shoots-at-man-in-south-delhi-in-alleged-case-of-road-rage-101630001006707.html
27-08-2021||Delhi||Former Unitech bosses had several run-ins with law during their stay in Tihar||Former Unitech promoters Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra --- who were ordered to be shifted separately to Arthur Road jail and Taloja central jail in Maharashtra -- have had a controversial stint inside Delhi’s Tihar jail, the country’s largest prison.They were arrested in 2017 for duping over 500 homebuyers, in 74 Unitech projects, and were lodged in a cell inside jail number 7. During their time inside Tihar, there were at least four cases, in which the they used their influence to circumvent rules inside the prison.The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the Chandra brothers to be immediately shifted out from Delhi’s Tihar Jail after the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) claimed that the accused in collusion with jail authorities were using the jail precincts to engage in illegal activities, share proceeds of crime and influence witnesses with a view to derail the investigation against them.On August 16, ED wrote to Delhi Police Commissioner seeking an inquiry into the alleged collusion of Tihar jail authorities with the Chandra brothers. Wondering why the Commissioner of Police waited for 10 days to take action on such a serious issue, the Court directed the Delhi Police chief to personally take up the investigation to begin forthwith and submit a report in four weeks on the “complicity of all officers (of Tihar Jail) who acted in violation of law” as detailed in the ED letter.In May 2019, Tihar jail authorities, on the directions of the Supreme Court, withdrew facilities such as telephones, an air cooler and a desktop computer, that the two men had got to conduct their business and recover money to pay back the investors.On May 23, 2018, during an inspection jail officers found a mini fridge, imported chocolates, perfume bottles and at least six cell phones in their jail cell. At least two jail warders were suspended for helping the two men get access to the items that are not allowed to the prisoners.Also on May 18, two prison warders were suspended for allowing the Chandra brothers to meet their wives inside an office in jail 1, and also allowed them to bring in home-cooked meal. The two prison warders were suspended only after a third warder filed a complaint and informed the Tihar control room. Under prison rules, allowing their wives inside the office and bring food from outside are barred under the rules.A month later, on July 31, the then station house office of the Hauz Khas police station, inspector Neeraj Tyagi was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation for taking bribe from the two businessmen to settle at least 47 cases filed against Unitech at the Saket police station.In November 2018, when a city judge visited the prison premises for a surprise inspection, he noted that the Unitech promoters were living “an extra luxurious life” and had access to their special brand of mineral water, one that was not sold in the jail’s canteen.A mid-level prison officer, who asked not to be named, said on Thursday that Sanjay and Ajay Chandra must have heavily bribed prison guards who helped them run their alleged racket inside the prison cell.“At least in official prison records, they have not been caught for violating any rule in the last one year. They are clean as per the jail records but how is it possible? It is apparent that some officers were helping them and covering their crimes. The inquiry by the police will unearth the role of the jail guards. An independent inquiry will expose the corruption inside the jail,” one prison officer, who asked not to be named said.Siddhartha Dave, the counsel for the Chandra brothers, did not comment on the previous cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/former-unitech-bosses-had-several-run-ins-with-law-during-their-stay-in-tihar-101630000946115.html
27-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi zoo gets 465 new ‘high-end’ CCTV cameras to monitor animal’s welfare||The Delhi zoo has got 465 new high-end surveillance cameras covering its entire premises, officials said on Tuesday, adding that the CCTVs will help observe animals’ behaviour, besides monitoring their well-being.“These are high-definition cameras that have a 20X zoom and can rotate 360 degrees. A full-fledged control room has been set up within the premises for round-the-clock monitoring,” a statement by the zoo authorities said.So far the zoo had a few surveillance cameras installed only at critical points that did not cover the entire premises.“The cameras will now cover all the cages, pathways, visitors areas and even the wooded area, which will help ensure security and better monitoring of the health of the animals”, said a senior official, who asked not to be named.“Round the clock monitoring of animal’s health is crucial. Though zookeepers keep a watch 24x7, the cameras will give us insights into their behaviour for a prolonged period and help us identify things that can bettered for their well-being. If an animal is sick or is in a reproductive stage, it will be an added advantage to monitor their movement and make arrangements for what it needs accordingly,” the official said.Zoo officials said the monitoring control room was opened on Thursday. Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director general of forests (wildlife) of the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change, was the chief guest on the day.The Delhi zoo, located near the Old Fort, is spread over an area of 176 acres, and presently houses 94 species and 1,162 animals.Zoo authorities also said they are aiming to increase the number of species by bringing in more animals under a host of exchange programmes.The Delhi zoo was reopened to the public on August 1 this year.It was shut for visitors on March 18 last year, a week before the nationwide lockdown that lasted 68 days was imposed. This was followed by an avian flu outbreak in January this year. The zoo finally reopened on April 1 this year, only to be closed two weeks later, as the fourth wave of Covid-19 spread in the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-zoo-gets-465-new-high-end-cctv-cameras-to-monitor-animal-s-welfare-101630000945410.html
27-08-2021||Delhi||Teachers oppose DU’s move to appoint foreign scholars as adjunct faculty||Several teachers of Delhi University have objected to the varsity decision to allow international scholars as adjunct faculty members in DU, at a time when the university has over 4,100 ad hoc teachers waiting to be regularised. They said the move will adversely impact the pay of such ad hoc teachers.The decision to appoint global scholars as adjunct faculty was taken by the academic council on Tuesday and will be placed before the executive council, the highest decision-making body of the university, on August 31. This came after an August 3 meeting of senior university officials to discuss issues about the appointment of such teachers.According to the minutes of that meeting, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times, the six-member committee decided that international scholars, including those of Indian origin from the top 500 universities (as per QS rankings), could be involved in multiple teaching-learning activities in DU. The QS rankings is an annual rating published by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) and is one of the most widely followed rankings both by academics and students.According to the minutes, the foreign scholars may be involved in teaching core and elective Masters courses; teaching of existing or newly designed courses to PhD students based on the individual’s area of expertise; co-supervision of PhD scholars; supervision of Masters dissertation; and other academic or research activities in consultation with the departments concerned.“The teachers could also be involved in providing guidance to departments on securing external funding, student scholarships, internships, and “develop international collaborations, linkages with industry, patents and commercialisation of research,” the minutes said.Academic council member Alok Pandey, who was one of four members who gave a note of dissent on the matter on Tuesday, said, “If the foreign faculty members start teaching core papers, the existing teachers will suffer. We have around 4,100 ad hoc teachers who have to take a minimum of 16 classes a week. If the number of classes is reduced, these teachers will be considered guest teachers, further reducing their pay. What is the need for appointing international faculty when we have no dearth of good teachers?”Colleges may also consider appointing foreign teachers after securing approval from the governing body and dean of colleges, the DU said. Pandey said they had agreed to the appointment of such teachers on a needs basis in departments that require scholars from specialised fields.“We had asked them (DU officials) to refrain from implementing it in colleges but they didn’t agree. So we gave a dissent note saying that the adjunct faculty will replace current ad hoc teachers,” he said.Former DU officials, however, said adjunct faculty were used globally for assisting teachers. “The current provisions leave room for increasing the workload of these international teachers and move towards contractualisation. The committee’s decision of allowing colleges to appoint such faculty members encourages that,” said Pankaj Garg, former AC member.Suman Kundu, chair, DU committee on the matter and director of south campus, said, “Adjunct faculty cannot replace our teachers. They cannot be appointed on a regular basis or be paid a salary. They are not regular teachers. They are faculties appointed in their respective organisations with their own assigned workload and duties. They are only for value addition and we are committed to our teachers.”“Budgetary provisions may be created for honorarium and local travel expenses... for appointment of adjunct faculty at the level of university. Departments may also sponsor adjunct faculties from their internal sources with approval from the competent authority as per the implementation plans,” the minutes of the August 3 meeting stated.According to the plan, the department has to consult the staff council before forwarding the nomination of adjunct faculty to the dean with required justifications. Following this, a seven-member committee with dean (academics) as chair would forward the proposal to the competent authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/teachers-oppose-du-s-move-to-appoint-foreign-scholars-as-adjunct-faculty-101630000822984.html
27-08-2021||Delhi||English syllabus changed so as not to ‘hurt sentiments’, says DU registrar||A day after several Delhi University (DU) teachers voiced their dissent in the strongest terms against the removal of texts by renowned author Mahasweta Devi and two Dalit authors from the undergraduate English syllabus, the varsity administration on Thursday said the dissent and objections were “misplaced” and “unfounded” as the final syllabus was approved through a democratic process.“The final content of the syllabus has been designed by the department of English,” registrar Vikas Gupta said in a press note on Thursday, adding that the oversight committee finalised the syllabus after “due deliberations and recommendations of the head of the department”.The oversight committee is tasked with looking into problems with regards to exams, course changes, and other department requirements in the absence of statutory body meetings.“The university subscribes to the idea that the literary content, forming a part of the text in a language course of study, should contain materials that do not hurt the sentiments of any individual and is inclusive in nature to portray a true picture of our society, both past and present,” Gupta said.On Wednesday, Hindustan Times had quoted the oversight committee chairperson MK Pandit saying the committee had “conflicting opinions” over Devi’s work “Draupadi “, the story of a tribal woman.Devi, a Bengali author and tribal and women rights activist, had received several awards and accolades for her seminal body of work, including the Sahitya Akademi award and the Jnanpith Award, and was also conferred with the Padma Vibhushan, the second-highest civilian award in India. She died in Kolkata in 2016.In a dissent note submitted by 15 academic council (AC) members on Tuesday, teachers said the oversight committee approved changes without consulting the English department.Apart from the removal of Devi’s “Draupadi”, the changes also included the removal of works by two Dalit scholars, Bama and Sukartharini, which were replaced by texts by upper caste author Ramabai. The committee also removed “a feminist interpretation of Ramayana”, and deleted sections from “Interrogating Queerness” paper.Responding to the registrar’s press note, academic council members Rajesh Kumar, Biswajit Mohanty, and Mithuraaj Dhusiya released a statement on Thursday saying, “To use “hurt sentiments” as an excuse to delete texts is a blatant attempt to impose thought control of the dominant and privileged social groups. By suggesting that the syllabus should merely uphold the status quo and not critique or question the same, the DU press release has actually undermined the very ethos of the university.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/english-syllabus-changed-so-as-not-to-hurt-sentiments-says-du-registrar-101630000767887.html
27-08-2021||Delhi||Delhi has most CCTV cameras, surpasses New York, London||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said the national capital has surpassed the megacities such as New York, London and Shanghai in having the most number of CCTV cameras installed per square mile.He cited a Forbes India report on the most surveilled cities of the world, which put Delhi on the top with 1,826.6 CCTV cameras per square mile, followed by London with 1,138. Chennai secured third place with 609.9 CCTV cameras while Mumbai came in 18th with 157.4 CCTV cameras per square mile, the report said.In a tweet, he said, “I feel proud to say that Delhi beat cities like Shanghai, New York and London with most CCTV cameras per square mile across the world. At first, Delhi has 1,826 cameras, while at second, London has 1,138 cameras per square mile. My compliments to the Delhi Government’s officers and engineers who worked on the project like a mission and achieved the feat in such a short time.”A press statement issued by his office later in the day said: “The Kejriwal government has delivered on its promise. Delhi ranks number 1 out of 150 cities across the world in terms of CCTV cameras installed per square mile. It beat cities like Shanghai, New York and London. Delhi has 1,826 CCTVs installed per square mile, three times more than Chennai, and 11 times more than Mumbai.”“Delhi ranks number one in the list with 1,826 cameras per square mile, followed by London with 1,138, Chennai with 609, and Shenzhen (China) with 520. Only three Indian cities feature in the top 20— Delhi at rank 1, Chennai at rank 3, and Mumbai is at rank 18 with 157 cameras per square mile,” the release said.In the first phase of the project, the government installed nearly 275,000 cameras across the city and is currently working on the second phase of the project, in which it aims to install 140,000 cameras, the statement said.The CCTV project is part of the government’s larger action plan on enhancing women safety in the capital, which was one of the main aspects of the manifesto of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the 2020 assembly elections.The government further said, “All CCTV feeds are highly secure, with hardware monitored by the community. Feeds are accessible only to authorised users, and the system itself is capable of automatic health checkups to detect disturbances and intrusions. The Delhi government ensures the security and privacy of all feeds collected, and ensures that it is only used for authorised purposes by authorised users.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-has-most-cctv-cameras-surpasses-new-york-london-101630000523726.html
27-08-2021||Pune||982 runaway children found at Pune railway station over past 2 years||Over the past two years, around 982 children – mostly from Jharkhand and Bihar, who ran away from their homes due to abject poverty or because they were tired of studies, in search of a better life in the city - have been traced at Pune railway station.Rohit Dubey, coordinator of Sathi Pune Railway Childline, an NGO, said, “Our social organisation is working round-the-clock to trace runaway children and ensure that they go back home. In the past two years, 982 children have come to Pune from different parts of the country, especially Jharkhand and Bihar.”The NGO workers keep a very strict vigil at the railway station and carry out patrolling thrice during the night to find out children who are either crying or begging. The NGO workers then take the children into confidence and find out their place of residence. A legal process is completed after which the children are repatriated to their hometowns. In similar instances in the past, counselors have found children addicted to tobacco, cigarettes and even drugs.According to the Government Railway Police (GRP) on an average, two to three children in the ages of 6 to 14 years land up at Pune railway station on a daily basis. A majority of these children arrive ticketless in the general bogey and take up odd jobs at paan stalls and other small business establishments. After completing their day’s work, they return to the railway station premises to sleep.Physically assaulted and not given food on time by their kin, the children, fed up of constant torture and harassment, flee their homes and land up in Pune. When such children are found, the police try to locate their address and send them home. If the address cannot be located, the children are turned over to observation homes where detailed enquiries are carried out to locate their address.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/982-runaway-children-found-at-pune-railway-station-over-past-2-years-101629998242787.html

However, Gaurav Tripathi, entrepreneur and chief executive officer of Superpro.ai, has beaten the odds to offer people a chance to celebrate their favourite festival albeit virtually.Tripathi has come up with an app, to be used free-of-cost by individuals and societies seeking to create virtual pandals for their Bappa. Society pandals can be customised as per the theme and other specifications and can accommodate nearly 20,000 people at a time. What’s more, 25 societies have already registered for the virtual Ganesh festival on Tripathi’s app.“The Ganesh festival is one of the biggest festivals but due to covid restrictions on public gatherings, we are offering residential societies a chance to hold all events of the Ganesh Utsav on a virtual platform. I have created an app which can be used to create a customised virtual pandal and celebrate the festival,” Tripathi said.“The app is interactive and has Indian motifs as emojis, so one can shower marigolds on Bappa or even draw Swastikas or send ‘Om’ symbols through chats. One can also participate in live videos through the app chat,” added Tripathi, who is busy pursuing Ganesh mandals to opt for this manner of holding the festival.Jay Salunkhe, Shahupuri mandal, Kolhapur, said, “We have spoken with the team, and are thinking of going online but we will decide in the committee. Last year, it was very difficult and we just had the idol and it was under heavy security.” Sanjeev Singh, a resident of Balewadi, said, “The Ganpati festival began for the wellbeing of the society and country. Due to the benefits and emotions attached with the Ganpati festival, we cannot ignore this tradition. Today in the interest of society, it is the need of the hour to avoid gatherings and still celebrate our festival. We have decided to solve this challenge using technology. Additionally, this platform has been developed by techies in Pune. It is made in India, by India and for India. The data will not go outside our country or into the custody of others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/now-an-app-for-individuals-societies-to-celebrate-bappa-virtually-101629995722606.html

Priyanka Sharma has decided to focus on the JEE exams for which she has already started preparation, rather than going the regular Class 11 followed by Class 12 way.Pingle and Sharma are not alone. A large number of Class 10 students have decided to skip Class 11 for further preparations and also due to heavy college fees, and directly take external admission for Class 12 board exams next year. Instead of registering for the Class 11 centralised admission process, these students have filled out “form number 17” to appear externally for Class 12 board exams next year while also getting access to the campus, laboratories and other facilities by paying nominal college fees.Pingle said, “I lost my father to the Covid-19 pandemic and so, I need to earn for my family now. We have already started a small, in-house business of making papad and other food materials. I have decided not to take admission this year for Class 11 and will directly appear for Class 12 board exams next year externally.”While Sharma said, “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the entire education field has gone online and despite studying so hard, our Class 10 exams were cancelled. Even if I take admission for Class 11, there will be online lectures for the whole year. So I have decided to skip this year, focusing instead on my JEE preparations after the Class 12 exams to get a good college.”The trend may be finding favour among students but is seen as adversely impacting junior colleges which are already struggling with college fee issues and now, less number of students.Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal, Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, Shivajinagar, said, “Less number of students registering for Class 11 admissions is a matter of concern for all junior colleges, and it is seen that students have deliberately skipped this year and are going directly for Class 12 exams externally. By filling up form number 17, they will be able to appear for the board exams externally and by paying some nominal fees to the college, they will be able to attend practicals in laboratories during studies.”A total 79,217 students have registered for Class 11 admissions this academic year. Despite the high Class 10 passing percentage of 99.95% this year – 4.65% more than that in 2020 – student registrations for Class 11 have been less when compared to the available 111,205 seats. Hence, it is feared that a large number of Class 11 seats will remain vacant this year.Meanwhile, Shehanaz Cottar, principal of the Podar International School and Junior College, Chinchwad, said, “This year, the admission process has been delayed due to late declaration of results and the court’s decision to cancel the CET. This has had an impact with less number of students registering for Class 11 admissions. The students are anxious and schools have to prepare themselves to work around the new centralised processes. Nevertheless, the education system is trying to pull through one of the toughest situations on hand with able support from schools. They have proceeded for the centralised admission process through online registration, which has helped students register for round 1.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-skipping-class-11-going-for-class-12-boards-externally-101629994882590.html

Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters Friday that the United States is monitoring the threats “virtually, in real-time.”“We still believe there are credible threats. In fact, I'd say specific, credible threats, and we want to make sure we're prepared for those,” Kirby said.“We have additional information...what you're seeing us act on, to the degree we can talk about, it is based on information that we have, and I think, I think I’d like it at that,” he added.The attack outside the Kabul airport took place even as the United States was aware of the threats from the Islamic State terrorists. When asked about whether another such attack is potentially imminent, the Pentagon spokesperson said, “We certainly are prepared and would expect future attempts, absolutely, but I won't get into the specifics of what those are and why we're doing what we're doing.”Also Read | A day after confirming, US says no second explosion near Kabul's Baron HotelWithout elaborating on the nature of the threat, Kirby stressed that they are “monitoring these threats, very, very specifically, virtually in real-time.”Several countries have decided to wind up the evacuation operations in Afghanistan in the wake of heightened security concerns but the US has insisted on continuing the mission till the August 31 deadline. US Army Major General William Taylor asserted that the Islamic State terrorists won’t deter the US troops from accomplishing the mission.“There are more than 5,000 US service members in harm’s way saving as many people as they can. It's a noble mission. We have seen firsthand how dangerous that mission is, but ISIS will not deter us from accomplishing this mission,” the deputy director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told the briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-are-the-specific-and-credible-threats-pentagon-preparing-for-in-kabul-101630083917735.html

Might have done 'naively', claims report||A recent report by US-based Politico has revealed that US officials in Kabul gave the Taliban a list of names of American citizens, green card holders and Afghan allies in the country so that they can be easily evacuated. But after the blasts near the Kabul airport that have killed over 100 people, the naive list of names is being interpreted as 'kill list', as the Taliban are known to be vindictive against Afghans who help the United States. "Basically, they just pull all those Afghans on a kill list," a defence official told Politico on the condition of anonymity.US President Joe Biden on Thursday did not deny any such list and said there may have been a list of names of vulnerable Afghans. "There have been occasions when our military has contacted their military counterparts in the Taliban and said this, for example, this bus is coming through with X number of people on it, made up of the following group of people. We want you to let that bus or that group through," he said. "So, yes there have been occasions like that. To the best of my knowledge, in those cases, the bulk of that has occurred and they have been let through.Joe Biden to Kabul attackers: 'We will hunt you down and make you pay'The Biden administration was relying on the Taliban for security outside the airport, though the Taliban said that the blasts took place in the area managed by US forces. The ISIS-Khorasan has claimed the responsibility for the deadly attack and said their target was US forces.The Politico report said the list issue came up during a classified briefing on Capitol Hill this week and top Biden administration officials defended that close coordination with the Taliban was the best way to keep Americans and Afghans safe. “They had to do that because of the security situation the White House created by allowing the Taliban to control everything outside the airport,” one US official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/did-us-officials-give-taliban-a-kill-list-might-have-done-naively-claims-report-101630080767086.html

27-08-2021||World||Taliban-Haqqani-Al Qaeda: What experts think is happening in Afghanistan||The blasts near Kabul airport on Thursday which the Taliban have officially condemned is a major jolt to both the United States and the Taliban, experts have said. The attack by the ISIS-Khorasan province puts the Taliban under pressure to secure Kabul, analysts interviewed by news agency AFP said. At the same time, the attack puts the Taliban-Haqqani-Al Qaeda triumvirate under the scanner, analysts told New York Times. ISIS-K’s links with the Taliban through Haqqani has also been suggested by some experts.Afghanistan's former vice president Amrullah Saleh alleged that the IS-K have their roots in Talibs and Haqqani network, particularly the ones operating in Kabul; though ISIS-K and the Taliban are rivals."Last night's attacks have shown once again that no one group can claim monopoly over violence in Afghanistan or claim to secure it," said Abdul Basit, a researcher of international studies told AFP.The Taliban have claimed to be aware of such imminent threats but the back-to-back blasts at crowded airport areas proved that their security failed, in case they intended to provide security to Afghan people, as promised earlier. "Taliban checkpoints that dot around the city failed to catch the perpetrators of the Kabul airport attack. But that's based on the assumption the Taliban intended to provide security in the first place to protect lives," Nishank Motwani, an Afghan analyst told AFP.A New York Times analysis says that a strike of this magnitude would bolster ISIS-K’s stature in the jihadist world as this branch of the Islamic State is not a major force, neither in Afghanistan, not in the world. The group’s ranks have dropped to about 1,500 to 2,000 fighters, about half from its peak levels in 2016, the NYT report said.“The Taliban, Haqqani network, and Al Qaeda function as a triumvirate, and one that is very much part of the same militant network, they work together hand-in-glove,” Colin P. Clarke, a counterterrorism analyst told NYT adding that they have actually grown closer over the past decade. And the closeness will only increase after the US withdrawal, the analyst said.An Afghanistan specialist at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, Seth G Jones told NYT that ISIS-K is not a first-tier ISIS affiliate but with the Afghan commandoes and the American military gone, they might get a breathing room.ISIS leader Shahab al-Muhajir is reported to have been a former mid-level Haqqani commander before defecting. Many ISIS commanders and fighters were once part of Al Qaeda or an Al Qaeda franchise and hence experts are not ruling out the IS-Haqqani-Taliban link.(With inputs from AFP and New York Times)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talibanhaqqanial-qaeda-what-experts-think-is-happening-in-afghanistan-101630074869001.html

The body of a male cub was found on Thursday about 5 meters (15 feet) away, he said.An examination determined they died from infected wounds caused by traps, Arianto said.He said several traps similar to ones used to capture wild pigs on farms were found in the area of the bodies.“Setting traps for pigs in a conservation area is very unlikely,” Arianto said, “This was intended to poach endangered animals for economic gain." He said his agency will cooperate with law enforcement agencies in an investigation.Sumatran tigers, the most critically endangered tiger subspecies, are under increasing pressure due to poaching as their jungle habitat shrinks, according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It estimated fewer than 400 Sumatran tigers remain in the wild.It was the latest in a series of killings of endangered animals on Sumatra island. Conservationists have warned that the coronavirus pandemic has led to increased poaching as villagers turn to hunting for economic reasons.Early last month, a female tiger was found dead with injuries caused by a snare trap in South Aceh district.An elephant was found without a head on July 11 at a palm plantation in East Aceh. Police arrested an alleged poacher along with four people accused of buying ivory taken from the dead animal.Aceh police also arrested four men in June for allegedly poaching a tiger with a snare trap and selling its remains for 100 million rupiah ($6,900). Days later, another Sumatran tiger died after it ate a goat laced with rat poison in neighboring North Sumatra province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-endangered-sumatran-tigers-found-dead-in-indonesia-101630063112450.html

The US has said that it would pull all its troops out of the country by August 31, before which the evacuations have been continuing frantically. Meanwhile, two explosions rocked the Kabul airport earlier on Thursday in which several civilians along with US armed personnel were killed.Also read | Taliban return but war isn’t over. Know the groups vying to take control of AfghanistanDue to the security concerns in the Kabul international airport, Brennan said that it would not be suitable for the supply of aid in Afghanistan. “Right now because of security concerns and several other operational considerations, Kabul airport is not going to be an option for the next week at least,” news agency Reuters quoted him as saying during a press briefing.Further, he also said that the WHO is working with the Pakistani authorities to establish an air bridge into Afghanistan. “One of the problems we have in Afghanistan right now is there is no civil aviation authority functioning but we are working with Pakistan particularly in the context of Mazar-i-Sharif airport. Because they can work with contacts on the ground that all the necessary steps to land an aircraft, to land a cargo aircraft, can be put in place,” he added.Mentioning that insurance prices for flying into Afghanistan have “skyrocketed to prices never seen before,” Brennan said, “So we are trying to jump through that hoop at the moment and once we have addressed that we will hopefully be airborne in the next 48 to 72 hours.”(With Reuters inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-medical-supplies-to-run-out-within-days-in-afghanistan-hopes-to-establish-air-bridge-soon-101630063161588.html

Afghanistan former vice president Amrullah Saleh said the IS-K has its roots in Talibs and Haqqani network, particularly the ones operating in Kabul. US President Joe Biden, on the other hand, said he has not found any evidence that the Taliban colluded with the IS terrorists in carrying out the attacks.Amid this debate, the role of Khalil Haqqani, who is in charge of the security of Kabul has come under the scanner. Here are 5 things to know about him1. Khalil Haqqani has had a $5 million reward after the US designated him a terrorist 10 years ago.Kabul blast: What Amrullah Saleh says on Taliban, ISIS-K, Haqqani link2. Khalil Haqqani is a Haqqani group leader. After the fall of Kabul on August 15, he was seen roaming the streets of Kabul.3. On one hand, Khalil has Taliban support and on the other, he had "acted on behalf of al-Qaeda and their terrorist operations".4. Apart from making a lot of day-to-day decisions for the Haqqani network, Khalil was also close to Pakistan intelligence.5. Khalil was a CIA partner when the CIA was providing weapons to Afghan rebels in the 1980s to fight the Soviet terrorist.Taliban and IS-K: Haqqani the missing linkIS-K has major differences with the Taliban as the Taliban are now in favour of peace talks. According to IS-K, the Taliban have abandoned Jihad. But the missing link between the two groups is Haqqani and, as Amrullah Saleh said, the Haqqani that is operating in Kabul. While many experts think that IS-K will be a major security challenge for the Taliban in Afghanistan, the Taliban after taking over Afghanistan released many prisoners which included IS and al-Qaeda terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-khalil-haqqani-the-self-proclaimed-head-of-kabul-security-101630062117006.html

Since then, it has administered another billion shots in the last 10 weeks.More than 889.4 million people have been fully vaccinated in China, the NHC spokesperson, Mi Feng said.Continuous efforts will be made to advance the mass vaccination campaign, Mi said on Friday, warning against any slackness among the public in personal protection.Speaking at a health conference recently, China’s top respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan had said that the country is aiming to fully vaccinate 80% of its 1.4 billion population by the end of 2021.China’s push to boost vaccination rates accelerated since July when the highly contagious Delta variant triggered the worst country-wide outbreak since last year.The outbreak is now under control but authorities have kept up the pace of the country’s vaccine campaign.The respiratory expert Zhong said achieving herd immunity depends on vaccine efficacy and virus transmissibility. “The efficacy of China-developed vaccines is about 70%, so the country would need more than 80% of the population to be vaccinated before establishing herd immunity,” Zhong was quoted as saying by Chinese state media.Zhong added China is expected to reach that goal by the end of 2021.According to experts, herd immunity occurs when a large portion of a population becomes immune to a spreading infection or disease, preventing transmission within communities.Chinese President Xi Jinping has also said the country will strive to provide 2 billion vaccine doses to the world throughout this year and offer $100 million to Covax.Speaking at the NHC press conference in Beijing on Friday, Zheng Zhongwei, an NHC official said that experts in China have recommended making booster Covid-19 doses available to specific groups, such as employees at higher risk of exposure to the virus and those who have weak immunity or are aged above 60.These people who work in the aviation industry, customs, borders, quarantine sites and specific medical institutions, as well as those who travel abroad to places where the virus is still spreading, should get a booster shot six months after completing their regular vaccination regimens, Zheng was quoted as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-889-4mn-fully-jabbed-against-covid-in-china-101630061728626.html

Medical examiners ruled his death as suicide. The guards who were deployed to check Epstein’s cell were accused of napping and surfing the internet rather than checking on the convict, the report added.Issuing a statement, the Justice Department said on Thursday that the MCC will be closed at least temporarily in order to resolve issues related to safety and infrastructure. “In an effort to address the issues at MCC NY as quickly and efficiently as possible, the Department has decided to close the MCC, at least temporarily, until those issues have been resolved,” the Justice Department said. However, it has not given the date on which the MCC will be closed.Also Read| ‘It was a huge mistake’: Bill Gates regrets meeting Epstein for 'philanthropy'The facility currently has 233 inmates and a majority of them are expected to be transferred to another federal jail in Brooklyn.

Know the groups vying to take control of Afghanistan||The Taliban ousted the Ashraf Ghani-led government in Afghanistan and took over the effective control of the war-torn country after capturing Kabul earlier this month. The return of the insurgents to power after two decades has thrown left Afghanistan with an uncertain future while the latest suicide bombings outside Kabul airport by the Islamic State has compounded the problems for Afghans as well as the international community.Afghan and US officials had earlier said that at least 60 civilians and 13 US Marines were killed in these attacks. A report by Associated Press suggests that the death toll of Afghans in the suicide bombings is at least 95. The growing threat from the Afghanistan affiliate of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) forced many countries to abruptly end their evacuation operations.As the deadline for a complete withdrawal of US-led foreign troops approaches, Afghanistan’s political crisis could even worsen given several groups vying for power.Here are the groups trying to take control of Afghanistan:The Taliban: The group was founded by Mullah Mohammad Omar in 1994 and originally drew members from the so-called “mujahideen” fighters who fought against the erstwhile Soviet forces in the 1980s. The Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996-2001 before US forces invaded the country in what they called the fight against terrorism. The fighters regrouped over the past two decades and signed a deal with the United States that led to the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghan soil. The insurgents want to reestablish their regime.The Northern Alliance: The Panjshir Valley was free from Taliban rule during 1996-2001 and continues to stand strong against the Islamist fundamentalists. An alliance of Uzbek and ethnic Tajik forces, led by Ahmad Massoud, has vowed to continue fighting the Taliban. Amrullah Saleh, the first vice president of the ousted Afghan government, has backed the alliance in their fight against the Taliban.Also Read | Taliban ask Afghan imams to preach about obedience at Friday prayersISIS-K: The terrorist organisation is also made of hardline Sunni Islamist militants like the Taliban but the two groups are sworn enemies. ISIS-Khorasan, which pledged allegiance to slain Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2015, has been involved in some of the deadliest terror attacks in recent years. The leaders of ISIS-K rejected the deal between the Taliban and the US that has led to the withdrawal of foreign troops. According to a UN report, the strength of ISIS-K could be anywhere between 500 to 10,000.Al Qaeda: While the Taliban had pledged to prevent al Qaeda and other terrorist organisations from using Afghan soil in a peace deal signed with the United States, a UN report suggests the ties between the insurgents, especially its Haqqani network branch, and al Qaeda remain close. The report said that the ties stemmed from friendship, intermarriage, shared struggle and ideological sympathy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-return-but-war-isn-t-over-know-the-groups-vying-to-take-control-of-afghanistan-101630057242651.html

"We will not leave anyone behind."It was not immediately clear whether the vaccination campaign would extend to Rohingya Muslims living in densely-packed camps in Rakhine state and what the qualification criteria would be.The issue is deeply sensitive in Myanmar, where animosity about Rohingya runs deep. International rights groups say hundreds of thousands of stateless Rohingya should be entitled to citizenship rather than be discriminated against and branded illegal immigrants.A junta-appointed administrator earlier this month said there was no plan to include Rohingya in camps near the state capital Sittwe.At least 700,000 Rohingya fled Rakhine for Bangladesh in 2017 during operations by the army under the command of Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who is now prime minister and head of Myanmar's junta.UN investigators said those operations were carried out with "genocidal intent" but the army denied that and said they were aimed at countering Rohingya "terrorists".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/theyre-also-our-people-myanmar-will-extend-covid-19-vaccinations-to-rohingya-101630054299018.html

27-08-2021||World||New Zealand extends Covid lockdown till Aug 31; ‘Delta more infectious’, says PM||New Zealand on Friday extended its national lockdown for four more days amid the surging cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and warned that restrictions might last longer in Auckland, which is now the country’s virus epicentre. The lockdown was first imposed on August 17 and was supposed to end on Friday. According to news agency AFP, the Delta variant of the coronavirus emerged in Auckland the previous week, which ended a six-month period without any local transmission that made New Zealand one of the very few Covid-free zones across the globe.After holding a cabinet meeting in Wellington on Friday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that the Level 4 lockdown will remain in place till August 31 midnight. “We may be seeing the beginning of a plateau in cases,” Ardern said. “Our job is to keep up the hard work in order to bend and then flatten that curve. We have evidence that what we are doing is working, but caution is still required,” she added.In Auckland, this lockdown is likely to remain imposed for another two weeks while the rest of the regions in the South Pacific nation can descend to Level 3 lockdown. Under the third level, some businesses, including restaurants and retail outlets are allowed to reopen by using contactless collection methods. The government has still advised people to stay at home and work from home under this level. Gatherings are only restricted to 10 people while shops, daycare centres, schools and public venues are closed.On Friday, New Zealand reported 70 new community cases, which took the total infections amid the outbreak of the Delta variant to 347. While on Tuesday, the country recorded its highest single-day spike since April when 41 people were detected as Covid-19 positive. Prime Minister Ardern also pointed out on Friday that “Delta is definitely more infectious, and it moves more quickly,” adding that Level 4 lockdown is the most effective tool at the present moment.Arden has gained global recognition for reducing the spread of Covid-19 in New Zealand. But Reuters reported on Tuesday that questions have been raised regarding her reliance on stringent border controls and snap lockdowns, which have impacted the economy.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-extends-covid-lockdown-till-aug-31-delta-more-infectious-says-pm-101630042013264.html

These heinous attacks took the lives of many innocent people desperately seeking to leave the country and those supporting evacuation efforts, including US service members and medical personnel. As one of its closest allies, Canada joins with the United States as they mourn their fallen.”The Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISIS-K), which is an Afghanistan-based affiliate of the West Asian terror entity Islamic State, has reportedly claimed responsibility for the twin blasts and gunfire in the Kabul airport area. Afghan civilians seeking to flee the country and foreign troops stationed were among those who were killed. The attacks took place at Kabul airport’s Abbey Gate and the nearby Baron Hotel.Offering the Canadian government’s condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims and wishing full recovery to the injured, Trudeau said, “Our thoughts are with the people of Afghanistan, and everyone affected by these senseless acts of violence.”“As the situation on the ground continues to evolve, we will keep working with our international and local partners to support humanitarian efforts, fight terrorism, and ensure those who want to leave Afghanistan can do so safely,” he added.Trudeau said that “all Afghan people deserve to live in dignity, peace, and security.

27-08-2021||World||A year on, half of Wuhan’s hospitalised Covid patients have health issues: Study||Around half of the patients hospitalised with Covid-19 in the Chinese city of Wuhan in 2020 had health problems including muscle fatigue, shortness of breath and depression 12 months after their discharge, a year-long study has found.Overall, their health was weaker a year after recovery compared to those who were not infected with the virus, a study published in the medical journal Lancet said on Friday.The study conducted on recovered patients highlights the lingering impact of Covid-19 in some patients, sometimes lasting for months, though most recover fully.The study done by Chinese scientists from Beijing and Wuhan assessed health outcomes at six and 12 months for 1,276 Covid-19 patients treated at Jin Yin-Tan hospital in Wuhan between January and May 2020.The Covid-19 pandemic has so far claimed over 4.47 million lives around the world and infected more than 214 million people, according to the widely followed coronavirus tracker maintained by the US-based Johns Hopkins University. “Though most symptoms had resolved by 12 months, around one half of survivors still experienced at least one ongoing symptom (most commonly fatigue or muscle weakness), and one in three patients still experienced shortness of breath,” the study said.Around one in three people experienced shortness of breath while “lung impairments” persisted in some patients, especially those who had experienced the most severe illness with Covid-19.“Fatigue or muscle weakness was the most commonly reported symptom with around half of patients experiencing this at six months… Almost one third of patients reported experiencing shortness of breath at 12 months, which was more prevalent in patients who had been the most severely ill and had been on a ventilator during their time in hospital,” the study said.The study in Lancet also showed that the proportion of recovering patients reporting mental health issues was slightly higher at 12 months than at six, with 26% experiencing anxiety and depression.The Covid-19 virus first emerged in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, in late 2019 before spreading in and outside China, triggering the worst pandemic in a century.Bin Cao, a professor at National Centre for Respiratory Medicine at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing, said, “Our study is the largest to date to assess the health outcomes of hospitalised Covid-19 survivors after 12 months of becoming ill. While most had made a good recovery, health problems persisted in some patients, especially those who had been critically ill during their hospital stay.“Our findings suggest that recovery for some patients will take longer than one year, and this should be taken into account when planning delivery of healthcare services post-pandemic.”A Lancet editorial published with the study stressed on the need to understand and respond to the long-term impact of the disease.“Symptoms such as persistent fatigue, breathlessness, brain fog, and depression could debilitate many millions of people globally. Yet very little is known about the condition… With no proven treatments or even rehabilitation guidance, long Covid affects people’s ability to resume normal life and their capacity to work,” the editorial said.“The effect on society, from the increased healthcare burden and economic and productivity losses, is substantial. Long Covid is a modern medical challenge of the first order,” it added.What is worrying Xiaoying Gu, another author of the study from the same hospital as Bin quoted earlier, is the long-drawn psychological impact on patients.“We do not yet fully understand why psychiatric symptoms are slightly more common at one year than at six months in Covid-19 survivors. These could be caused by a biological process linked to the virus infection itself, or the body’s immune response to it. Or they could be linked to reduced social contact, loneliness, incomplete recovery of physical health or loss of employment associated with illness,” Xiaoying said.“Large, long-term studies of Covid-19 survivors are needed so that we can better understand the long term physical and mental health consequences of Covid-19,” Xiaoying added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-year-on-half-of-wuhan-s-hospitalised-covid-patients-have-health-issues-study-101630040907576.html
27-08-2021||World||‘We will hunt you down’: Joe Biden tells perpetrators of deadly Kabul attacks||US President Joe Biden vowed to hunt down the perpetrators of the suicide bombings carried out by the ISIS-K terror group near the Kabul airport on Thursday that killed dozens of people, including Afghan civilians and 13 US troops. He insisted the ongoing evacuation process in Afghanistan will continue undeterred by the twin attacks.Biden’s warning carries weight as the US military has in the past taken out Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who had masterminded the September 11, 2001 terror attacks in America; Islamic State (IS) founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi; and Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, considered the fountainhead of terrorism in West Asia.“To those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this - we will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay. I will defend our interests and our people with every measure at my command,” Biden said in a speech from the White House.He added, “We have some reason to believe we know who they are - not certain - and we will find ways of our choosing, without large military operations, to get them.”The American president went on to strike a note of defiance. “We will not be deterred by terrorists. We will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuation,” he said.Bien is facing continuing criticism at home and abroad for the abrupt withdrawal of US and US-led international forces from Afghanistan despite his and his aides’ attempts to blame the unfolding mess on his predecessor former US president Donald Trump and his 2020 deal with the Taliban.Biden has also faced pressure to extend the self-imposed deadline of August 31 for pulling out all American troops and personnel from Afghanistan. He has repeatedly pushed back against criticism, arguing that it’s time to end America’s longest war, and that the troop pull-out process would be messy irrespective of when it is eventually carried out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-will-hunt-you-down-joe-biden-tells-perpetrators-of-deadly-kabul-attacks-101630038447358.html
27-08-2021||World||28 Taliban fighters killed in IS attack on Kabul airport. Latest updates||Two suicide bombers and gunmen of the Islamic State group's affiliate in Afghanistan attacked Afghans flocking to Kabul's airport on Thursday, killing at least 60 Afghans and 13 US troops. The Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) said in its claim of responsibility that one of its suicide bombers targeted "translators and collaborators with the American army".The ISKP's statement carried a photo of what the militant group said was the bomber who carried out the attack. The image shows the alleged attacker standing with the explosive belt in front of the black IS flag with a black cloth covering his face, only his eyes showing.Here are the latest updates after the deadly Kabul airport attack:1. A Taliban official told Reuters on Friday that at least 28 members of the hardline Islamist group were among the people killed in explosions overnight outside the airport in Kabul. "We have lost more people than the Americans," the official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters. He said there was no reason to extend the August 31 deadline for foreign forces to leave the country.Also read | Saleh says Taliban denying ISIS link is like Pak denial on Quetta Shura2. The evacuation of civilians from Kabul has been accelerated after overnight attacks near the airport, a Western security official stationed at the airport told Reuters on Friday. The official, who declined to be named, said flights were taking off regularly.3. Australia has stopped evacuation flights from Afghanistan after the attacks by the Islamic State suicide bombers, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Friday. Morrison said Australia's military personnel had been evacuated from Kabul just hours before the attacks and with security so precarious it was no longer safe to continue evacuations. "Our plan now moves into its post evacuation stage and that involves ensuring the process of returning, through our official humanitarian program," Morrison told reporters in Canberra.Also read | Curious case of ISKP emir Aslam Farooqui and Pak links4. The US on Thursday evacuated 7,500 people from Afghanistan after the twin blasts rocked Kabul airport. "From August 26 at 3am EDT to August 26 at 3pm EDT, a total of approximately 7,500 people were evacuated from Kabul. This is the result of 14 US military flights (13 C-17s and 1 C-130) which carried approximately 5,100 evacuees and 39 coalition flights which carried 2,400 people," a White House official said.Also read | 'We will hunt you down': Biden to Kabul attackers5. Norway can no longer assist in evacuating remaining citizens from Afghanistan's capital, Norwegian foreign minister Ine Eriksen Soereide has said. "The doors at the airport are now closed and it is no longer possible to get people in," Soereide told broadcaster TV2 on Thursday.6. US troops helping to evacuate Afghans desperate to flee Taliban rule braced for more attacks on Friday after the Islamic State attack. General Frank McKenzie, head of US Central Command, said American commanders were on alert for more attacks by Islamic State, including possibly rockets or vehicle-borne bombs targeting the airport. "We're doing everything we can to be prepared," he said.7. US President Joe Biden has pledged the United States would hunt down those responsible for the two blasts at the Kabul airport and said he had asked the Pentagon to develop plans to strike back at them. "We will not forgive, we will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay," Biden said in remarks at the White House. He promised US evacuations would continue. "We will not be deterred by terrorists, we will not let them stop our mission. We will continue the evacuations," he said.Also read | Key things to know about ISIS-K, group behind Kabul airport attack8. Amrullah Saleh, who has proclaimed himself the 'caretaker' President of Afghanistan, said that ISKP has links with the Taliban and the Haqqani network. Saleh also hit out at the Taliban for denying links with the Islamic State. "Every evidence we have in hand shows that IS-K cells have their roots in Talibs & Haqqani network particularly the ones operating in Kabul. Talibs denying links with ISIS is identical/similar to the denial of Pakistan on Quetta Shura. Talibs have learned very well from the master. #Kabul," Saleh said in a tweet.9. White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said that the US flag will be flown at half-mast until the evening of August 30 to honour those killed at Kabul airport. "As a mark for respect, starting today, the United States flag will be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds... until sunset on August 30, 2021, in honour of the victims of the senseless acts of violence in Kabul," Psaki said.10. Joe Biden's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has been rescheduled as the US president cleared his agenda to address bombings in Kabul.

27-08-2021||World||Curious case of ISKP emir Aslam Farooqui and Pak links||It has now been said that the so-called Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), which has claimed responsibility for dastardly suicide bombings at Kabul airport killing more than 103 persons, is a rival of the Taliban, but the curious case of ISKP chief Aslam Farooqui shows that lines are totally blurred. And yet again the links of all the principal terrorist organizations go back to Pakistan. At least 13 US service personnel including 12 Marines have been killed in the bombing with scores injured.While US President Joe Biden has promised to hunt the killers of Kabul airport bombings, the so-called ISKP has released the name and photo of one of the suicide bombers as Abdul Rahman Al Logari and claimed credit for breaching the airport perimeter security managed by the ruling Taliban and US forces. From the ISKP claim letter, the actual targets were US forces and their Afghan allies identified as spies, not the Taliban. The Kabul airport attack shows that Afghanistan will remain a swamp of terrorists and terrorism for time to come and even the keys to ISKP lie in Rawalpindi as revealed by Aslam Farooqui, the chief perpetrator of the March 27, 2020, Kabul Gurudwara attack.Also read | 'We will hunt you down': Biden to Kabul attackersOn April 4, 2020, the Afghan National Security Directorate (NDS) arrested Mawlawi Abdullah aka Aslam Farooqui, the so-called emir of ISKP, in Nangarhar province for the Kabul gurdwara attack in which one Indian and 26 Afghan Sikhs were killed. A Pakistani national, Farooqui was earlier associated with Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which operates in collaboration with the Haqqani network in Kabul and Jalalabad, and the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan before he took over as ISKP chief in April 2019 after replacing Mawlawi Zia-ul-Haq aka Abu Omar Khorasani. A Mamozai tribesman from the Orakzai agency on the Pak-Afghan border, Farooqui was arrested along with four other Pakistani nationals. A Kasargod, Kerala, resident Muhsin Tikripur was killed in the Gurudwara attack.After the Taliban over-ran Kabul, Farooqui was released like other terrorists from Afghan jails. He was last lodged in the Bagram jail.Also read | Saleh says Taliban denying ISIS link is like Pak denial on Quetta ShuraWhat is interesting about Farooqui is that while India was denied permission by the coalition forces to interrogate, the Pakistan Foreign Ministry sought custody of the ISKP chief ostensibly on the grounds that he was involved in anti-Pakistan activities. The fact is that the Afghan ambassador to Pakistan was summoned by the Pakistan Foreign Office and the demand to hand over Farooqui was conveyed as the fear was that the ISKP chief would spill out all his affiliations with the Pakistani deep state. However, thanks to the institutionalised channels between the Pakistan and UK intelligence agencies, Farooqui was apparently never interrogated on those lines. The then Afghan government rejected the Pakistani demand and made it clear that Farooqui would be tried under Afghan laws as he had committed crimes against the Hazara Shias and Sikhs.Even though the Taliban does not recognize the presence of TTP in their second home or Pakistan, the two terrorist groups operate on both sides of Durand Lines with the US as their common enemy. The Farooqui case shows that terrorist groups in the Af-Pak region may operate with different brand names but the product and factory are the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/curious-case-of-iskp-emir-aslam-farooqui-and-pak-links-101630036129925.html

The study published in the British medical journal The Lancet stated that around half of Covid-19 patients discharged from the hospital still suffer from at least one persistent symptom, most often fatigue or muscle weakness after a year, reports AFP.The researchers noted that one in three patients still have shortness of breath a year after their diagnosis and the number is even higher in patients who are severely affected by the disease. "With no proven treatments or even rehabilitation guidance, long Covid affects people's ability to resume normal life and their capacity to work. The study shows that for many patients, full recovery from Covid-19 will take more than 1 year," The Lancet said in an editorial published with the study.The study observed about 1,300 people hospitalised for Covid-19 between January and May 2020 in China's Wuhan, the epicentre of the disease. The share of observed Covid-19 patients with at least one symptom decreased from 68 per cent after six months to 49 per cent after 12 months.The study found respiratory discomfort increased from 26 per cent of patients after six months to 30 per cent after 12 months. It also found affected women were 43 per cent more likely than affected men to suffer from fatigue or persistent muscle weakness and twice as likely to be diagnosed with anxiety or depression.The study adds to its earlier research that warned authorities in different nations that they must be prepared to provide long-term support to health workers and patients affected by Covid-19. "Long Covid is a modern medical challenge of the first order," the editorial said. It called for more research to understand the condition and better care for patients who suffer from it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fatigue-shortness-of-breath-last-a-year-for-many-covid-19-patients-says-study-101630029817148.html
27-08-2021||World||Microsoft warns thousands of cloud customers of exposed databases||Microsoft on Thursday warned thousands of its cloud computing customers, including some of the world's largest companies, that intruders could have the ability to read, change or even delete their main databases, according to a copy of the email and a cyber security researcher.The vulnerability is in Microsoft Azure's flagship Cosmos DB database. A research team at security company Wiz discovered it was able to access keys that control access to databases held by thousands of companies. Wiz Chief Technology Officer Ami Luttwak is a former chief technology officer at Microsoft's Cloud Security Group.Because Microsoft cannot change those keys by itself, it emailed the customers Thursday telling them to create new ones. Microsoft agreed to pay Wiz $40,000 for finding the flaw and reporting it, according to an email it sent to Wiz.Microsoft said it had no immediate comment.Microsoft's email to customers said it has fixed the vulnerability and that there was no evidence the flaw had been exploited. "We have no indication that external entities outside the researcher (Wiz) had access to the primary read-write key," the email said.“This is the worst cloud vulnerability you can imagine. It is a long-lasting secret,” Luttwak told Reuters. “This is the central database of Azure, and we were able to get access to any customer database that we wanted.”Luttwak's team found the problem, dubbed ChaosDB, on Aug. 9 and notified Microsoft Aug. 12, Luttwak said.The flaw was in a visualization tool called Jupyter Notebook, which has been available for years but was enabled by default in Cosmos beginning in February. After Reuters reported on the flaw, Wiz detailed the issue https://www.wiz.io/blog/chaosdb-how-we-hacked-thousands-of-azure-customers-databases in a blog post.Luttwak said even customers who have not been notified by Microsoft could have had their keys swiped by attackers, giving them access until those keys are changed. Microsoft only told customers whose keys were visible this month, when Wiz was working on the issue.The disclosure comes after months of bad security news for Microsoft. The company was breached by the same suspected Russian government hackers that infiltrated SolarWinds, who stole Microsoft source code. Then a wide number of hackers broke into Exchange email servers while a patch was being developed.A recent fix for a printer flaw that allowed computer takeovers had to be redone repeatedly. Another Exchange flaw last week prompted an urgent U.S. government warning https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/08/21/urgent-protect-against-active-exploitation-proxyshell that customers need to install patches issued months ago because ransomware gangs are now exploiting it.Problems with Azure are especially troubling, because Microsoft and outside security experts have been pushing companies to abandon most of their own infrastructure and rely on the cloud for more security.But though cloud attacks are more rare, they can be more devastating when they occur. What's more, some are never publicized.A federally contracted research lab tracks all known security flaws in software and rates them by severity. But there is no equivalent system for holes in cloud architecture, so many critical vulnerabilities remain undisclosed to users, Luttwak said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-warns-thousands-of-cloud-customers-of-exposed-databases-101630030340811.html
27-08-2021||World||From suicide bombings to brutal executions: Key things to know about ISIS-K behind Kabul airport||ISIS-K or Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) has claimed responsibility for the suicide attacks on the Kabul airport, which killed scores including Afghans trying to leave Afghanistan and at least 13 US service members. Islamic State said a suicide bomber "managed to reach a large gathering of translators and collaborators with the American army at 'Baran Camp' near Kabul Airport and detonated his explosive belt among them, killing about 60 people and wounding more than 100 others, including Taliban fighters."Reports have said that ISIS-K, the regional affiliate of ISIS or Islamic State that is active in Afghanistan and Pakistan, had long planned attacks on American personnel and others. The Taliban condemned the blasts outside the Kabul airport on Thursday.What is ISIS-K?ISIS-K is named after an old term for the region now lying in northeastern Iran, southern Turkmenistan and northern Afghanistan and first appeared in eastern Afghanistan in late 2014 and quickly established a reputation for extreme brutality. It was founded by hardline elements of the Pakistani Taliban who fled into Afghanistan when Pakistan security forces cracked down on them, according to some experts on Islamist militancy in the region.Also read | 'We will hunt you down': Biden to Kabul attackersUS intelligence officials have earlier told CNN the ISIS-K membership includes "a small number of veteran jihadists from Syria and other foreign terrorist fighters,". They have said that the US had identified 10 to 15 of their top operatives in Afghanistan.What's their location?The group has built up a presence in eastern Afghanistan in recent years, especially in the provinces of Nangahar and Kunar. ISIS-K has formed cells in Kabul which have carried out a number of devastating suicide attacks in and beyond the Afghan capital since 2016. ISIS-K, which was initially confined to a small number of areas on the border with Pakistan, has established a second major front in northern provinces including Jawzjan and Faryab.ISIS-K includes Pakistanis from other militant groups and Uzbek extremists in addition to Afghans, the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point said.How did it strengthen its position?US intelligence officials have said that the movement used the instability that led to the collapse of the Western-backed government in Afghanistan earlier this month to strengthen its position and step up recruitment of disenfranchised Taliban members.Also read | US says more attacks likely as Biden vows to avenge deadly Kabul airport blasts"ISIS-Khorasan exploited the political instability and rise in violence during the quarter by attacking minority sectarian targets and infrastructure to spread fear and highlight the Afghan government's inability to provide adequate security," the US defense department inspector general for Afghanistan (SIGAR) said in a report.Are they linked to the Taliban?While ISIS and the Taliban are both hardline Sunni Islamist terrorists, they are rivals and oppose each other. ISIS-K have major differences with the Taliban and accuse them of abandoning Jihad and the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement hammered out in "posh hotels" in Doha, Qatar.According to the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, their differences are also ideological. "The hostility between the two groups arose both from ideological differences and competition for resources. IS accused the Taliban of drawing its legitimacy from a narrow ethnic and nationalistic base, rather than a universal Islamic creed," the center said.Also watch | Inside 10 days of Taliban rule: Living in fear amid pockets of resistanceThe Associated Press has reported that as the Taliban sought to negotiate with the US in recent years, many of those opposed to these talks switched over to the more extremist Islamic State.Also read | US flag to fly at half-mast until August 30 in honour of Kabul attack victimsResearchers have said that there are strong links between ISIS-K and the Haqqani network, which in turn is closely linked to the Taliban. "Several major attacks between 2019 and 2021 involved collaboration between ISIS-K, the Taliban's Haqqani Network and other terror groups based in Pakistan," Dr Sajjan Gohel from the Asia Pacific Foundation told the BBC.What have they targeted?ISIS-K has carried out a series of suicide bombings in Kabul and other cities against both government and foreign military targets. Experts have said these were aimed at establishing their credentials as a more violent and extreme militant movement.From the executions of village elders to the killings of Red Cross workers and suicide attacks on crowds, including a series of bloody suicide operations against targets associated with the Shi'ite minority, have been blamed on the group.Among its recent targets was a Sufi mosque, electrical pylons and fuel tankers and Shi'ite bus passengers in Kabul. US officials also believe an attack on a girls school for the mainly Shi'ite Hazara minority was the work of ISIS-K.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-things-to-know-about-isis-k-group-behind-kabul-airport-attack-101630028830242.html

Speaking with emotion at the White House, Biden seemingly addressed the Islamic State (IS)-affiliated extremists responsible for the attack and said that the United States will neither forget nor forgive the act. “To those who carried out this attack as well as anyone who wishes America harm know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,” Biden declared.Also Read | Terror in heart of Kabul, explosions rock airportMore than 60 Afghans were killed and at least 140 turned up with serious injuries after a series of deadly blasts at Kabul in Afghanistan, according to the country's ministry of public health. At least 13 US service members were also killed in the attacks, which included a suicide bombing at the airport, while 18 more were left injured. The US Marine Corps said 10 Marines were also among those killed; however, the central command did not identify the dead by service.The attacks come amid the evacuation efforts led by the US and other countries to get people out of the Afghan capital ahead of Biden's August 31 withdrawal deadline. As many as 1,000 Americans and many more Afghans are still struggling to get out of Kabul, according to the Associated Press.US president Joe Biden, in his White House address following the Kabul attacks, asked for a moment of silence to honour the fallen service members, bowing his head, and ordered US flags to be flown half-staff across the country. "We have some reason to believe we know who they are... not certain," Biden said while referring to the bombers and gunmen involved in the attack, adding that military commanders have been instructed to develop plans to strike IS "assets, leadership, and facilities."Also Read | India condemns Kabul airport attackCNN reports the ISIS in Khorasan, also known as ISIS-K, has claimed that the suicide attack at the Kabul airport was carried out by an ISIS bomber, a threat that the US defense department had warned of earlier this year.The IS affiliate in Afghanistan has carried out many attacks on civilian targets in the country in recent years. It is far more radical than the Taliban, who seized power less than two weeks ago. The most heralded American attack on the group came in April 2017 when the US dropped the largest conventional bomb in its arsenal on an IS cave and tunnel complex. The group more recently is believed to have concentrated in urban areas, which could complicate US efforts to target them without harming civilians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-kabul-attackers-we-will-hunt-you-down-and-make-you-pay-101630023310160.html

McKenzie's remarks, a thirteenth US service member has died from his wounds suffered as a result of the attack on Abbey Gate," the spokesperson said on Thursday (local time). "The latest number of injured is now 18.The injured US service members are in the process of being evacuated in C-17 aircraft equipped with surgical units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-flag-to-fly-at-half-mast-until-august-30-in-honour-of-kabul-attack-victims-101630024545831.html
27-08-2021||World||It was 'last resort': Capitol Police officer who shot woman supporter of Trump||The US Capitol Police officer who fatally shot a woman as she tried to force her way into the House of Representatives during the Jan. 6 attack said the shooting was a "last resort" because he believed she posed a threat to members of Congress."I tried to wait as long as I could," police Lieutenant Michael Byrd said in an interview with "NBC Nightly News" that aired on Thursday, in what were his first public remarks since the violence."I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers."Byrd described the shooting as an act of "last resort" as he spoke publicly three days after a review by the Capitol Police concluded he had acted lawfully and within department policy in shooting the supporter of then-President Donald Trump as she tried to force her way through a smashed window into the House of Representatives' Speaker's Lobby."It was a very terrifying situation," Byrd said.The shooting of Ashli Babbitt, 35, came on a day of violence that saw hundreds of Trump supporters fight their way into the Capitol, attacking police and sending lawmakers running.Babbitt was a US Air Force veteran who embraced far-right conspiracy theories on social media, including Trump's false assertions that his 2020 presidential election loss was due to fraud. She was one of four participants in the riot to die on Jan. 6.Far-right groups have embraced Babbitt as a martyr, arguing she was murdered. Her cause has also been taken up by Trump, who falsely claimed last month that the officer who shot her was the "head of security" for a "high-ranking" Democratic member of Congress.VIOLENCE RECOUNTEDPolice officers who fought the mob recounted scenes of violence in which rioters beat them, taunted them with racist insults and threatened to kill an officer "with his own gun" in testimony last month to a congressional committee.A Capitol Police officer who had been attacked by rioters died the following day. Four police officers who took part in the defense of the Capitol later took their own lives. More than 100 police officers were injured.The Capitol Police review of the shooting concluded that it may have saved lives."The actions of the officer in this case potentially saved Members and staff from serious injury and possible death from a large crowd of rioters," the department said. It added that the officer's family had "been the subject of numerous credible and specific threats."The Justice Department in April closed its investigation into the death of Babbitt, saying there was no evidence that the officer had acted criminally in the shooting.The worst violence at the Capitol since the War of 1812 delayed the certification of Democratic President Joe Biden's election victory by several hours and brought a huge military presence into the city for several months.Trump supporters, including some of his Republican allies in Congress, have since tried to play down the day's events. Representative Andrew Clyde, who was photographed on Jan. 6 helping to barricade the House chamber door against attackers, has since compared the mob to "a normal tourist visit."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-was-last-resort-capitol-police-officer-who-shot-woman-supporter-of-trump-101630024102836.html
27-08-2021||World||US says more attacks likely as Biden vows to avenge deadly Kabul airport blasts||US forces in Kabul were bracing for more Islamic State attacks after at least two explosions ripped through the Kabul airport killing scores of Afghans and 13 US troops in Thursday's suicide bomb explosions even as President Joe Biden vowed to hunt down those responsible. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the twin explosions in a statement and said one of its suicide bombers had targeted "translators and collaborators with the American army."A US official told Reuters the number of US personnel killed was likely to rise even higher. Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of the US military's Central Command, told reporters the explosions were followed by gunfight. McKenzie said the threat from Islamic State persists alongside "other active threat streams." "We believe it is their desire to continue these attacks and we expect those attacks to continue - and we're doing everything we can to be prepared," McKenzie said, according to Reuters.Also read | India condemns Kabul airport attackMcKenzie also said that potential attacks could include rockets being fired at the Kabul airport or car bombs trying to get in. They were the first US troops killed in Afghanistan since February 2020 and were the deadliest incident for American soldiers in the country in a decade.The Trump administration struck an agreement with the Taliban in that month last year that called for the hardline Islamist group to halt attacks on Americans in exchange for a US agreement to remove all American troops and contractors by May 2021. Biden announced in April that he would have all US troops out by August."We will not forgive, we will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay," an emotional Biden said in remarks at the White House adding that US evacuations would continue. "I have also ordered my commanders to develop operational plans to strike ISIS-K assets, leadership and facilities. We will respond with force and precision at our time, at the place we choose and the moment of our choosing," Biden said.Also read | Trump, Republican lawmakers lash out at Biden after Kabul attackHe gave no indication of a change in the August 31 US pullout target. He asked for a moment of silence to honour the service members, bowing his head, and ordered US flags to fly at half-staff across the country.Also watch | Inside 10 days of Taliban rule: Living in fear amid pockets of resistanceThe United States has been racing to airlift American and other foreign nationals and their families as well as some Afghans before its troops are set to fully withdraw from the country.McKenzie also said the US evacuation mission was not going to stop. "I think we can continue to conduct our mission, even while we are receiving attacks like this," McKenzie said, adding that US forces will "go after" the perpetrators of Thursday's attack. McKenzie said there were about 1,000 US citizens estimated to be still in Afghanistan.Also read | Oppn parties express concern over India’s external securityAfghan health officials were quoted as saying 60 civilians died, but it was not clear whether that was a complete count. Video uploaded by Afghan journalists showed dozens of bodies and wounded victims strewn around a canal on the edge of the airport.Thursday's attacks came after the US and allies had urged Afghans to leave the area around the airport because of a threat by Islamic State. The US embassy in Kabul a day earlier advised Americans to avoid travelling to the airport and said those already at the gates should leave immediately, citing unspecified "security threats."(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-more-attacks-likely-as-biden-vows-to-avenge-deadly-kabul-airport-blasts-101630022352738.html
27-08-2021||World||Twin explosions leave Kabul shaken||The international community reacted with alarm after deadly terror attacks rocked the airport in the Afghan capital, with the UN condemning the day’s developments and the Nato insisting that evacuation efforts in Kabul shouldn’t be halted.“This incident underscores the volatility of the situation on the ground in Afghanistan, but also strengthens our resolve as we continue to deliver urgent assistance across the country in support of the Afghan people,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters.In Brussels, Nato secretarygeneral Jens Stoltenberg said allied forces should continue to evacuate as many vulnerable people as they can from Kabul despite what he branded a “horrific terrorist attack”.“Our priority remains to evacuate as many people to safety as quickly as possible,” he tweeted after two deadly explosions hit crowds on the perimeter of the airport in Afghanistan’s capital.The attacks hit ahead of an August 31 deadline for US troops to leave the airport on the outskirts of the Afghan capital, and as allied militaries wind down their rescue operations.Belgium and the Netherlands have already halted their airlift from the airport and other allied countries are to follow suit in the coming hours and days, despite fears that at-risk people will be left behind.Taliban group ‘strongly condemns’ attacksThe Taliban have condemned the attacks outside Kabul’s airport, saying they occurred in an area controlled by US forces. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said his group “strongly condemns” Thursday’s strikes and is paying close attention to security. The attack was believed to be carried out by Afghanistan’s Islamic State group affiliate, which is separate from and more radical than the Taliban.Instability feeding terrorism, rues EUEuropean Council president Charles Michel said he was very concerned about a blast outside the Kabul airport, warning that instability in Afghanistan must not benefit terrorism. “Securing safe passage to the airport remains vital,” said Michel, the chairman of the 27 national leaders of all the member countries of the European Union.“We need to ensure the current instability cannot give rise to a resurgence of terrorism.”The deadly attacks came hours after western nations warned earlier on Thursday of a possible terror attack on Kabul’s airport, where thousands have flocked as they try to flee Taliban-controlled Afghanistan in the closing stages of a massive international airlift. Britain had clearly warned an attack could happen within hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twin-explosions-leave-kabul-shaken-101630019914032.html
27-08-2021||World||Kabul airport blasts: Joe Biden promises to retaliate; evacuations to continue||President Joe Biden vowed to continue evacuations from Afghanistan after explosions in Kabul killed 12 US service members, and said the US will retaliate against those responsible for the bombings.“To those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes America harm, know this -- we will not forgive, we will not forget, we will hunt you down and make you pay,” Biden said Thursday in an address from the White House.The two explosions outside Kabul’s airport killed 12 US service members, and The Associated Press said at least 60 Afghans died. Biden said US intelligence had determined that militants from ISIS-K, an affiliate of Islamic State in Afghanistan, were likely behind the blasts.Also Read | Afghanistan: ISIS claims responsibility as dozens die in Kabul airport blastsGeneral Kenneth McKenzie, head of US Central Command, said he expects more attacks as the US moves to continue evacuations and pull American forces out of Afghanistan by Aug. 31. The US State Department said it’s in contact with about 1,000 Americans it believes remain in Afghanistan and over two-thirds of them indicated they’re taking steps to exit the country.“We will rescue the Americans who are there,” Biden said. “We will get our Afghan allies out.”Biden was briefed on the attacks earlier Thursday by his national security team. The violence disrupted his schedule for the day, with the White House scrapping a planned virtual meeting between the president and governors over resettling Afghan refugees and delaying a meeting between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.The US and other nations had warned their citizens not to congregate near the airport in recent hours, citing a credible threat of a terrorist attack. Earlier in the week, Biden had warned that continued US operations in the country faced a growing risk of targeting by ISIS-K. It was unclear in the immediate aftermath of Thursday’s bombings who was responsible.Biden had previously said that he planned to withdraw all US forces by Aug. 31, but left open the possibility of a continued presence if needed to evacuate American citizens seeking to flee the country after the Taliban takeover earlier this month. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, called on Speaker Nancy Pelosi to bring Congress back into session to address Wednesday’s attack, adding that “our enemies have taken advantage of the chaotic nature of the withdrawal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-airport-blasts-joe-biden-promises-to-retaliate-evacuations-to-continue-101630014940259.html
27-08-2021||World||Covid-19 deaths worldwide near 4.5mn mark||The coronavirus disease has killed at least 4,461,431 people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP on Thursday.The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the Covid-19 pandemic’s overall toll could be two to three times higher than official records, due to the excess mortality that is directly and indirectly linked to Covid-19.On Wednesday, 11,899 new deaths and 767,147 new cases were recorded worldwide.Meanwhile, Australia’s new daily cases of Covid-19 topped 1,000 on Thursday for the first time since the global pandemic began, as two major hospitals in Sydney set up emergency outdoor tents to help deal with a rise in patients.New South Wales state, where Sydney is the capital, reported 1,029 new cases, exceeding the previous record of 919 a day earlier. Of the new cases, 969 were detected in greater Sydney, up from 838. The rapid rise in Covid-19 patients has forced Sydney’s Westmead and Blacktown hospitals, which service the city’s sprawling western suburbs, to erect tents to screen and swab patients to help manage capacity.Also, Japan suspended the use of 1.63mn doses of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine on Thursday, more than a week after the domestic distributor received reports of contaminants in some vials.Both Japan and Moderna said that no safety or efficacy issues had been identified and that the suspension was just a precaution. “Moderna confirms having been notified of cases of particulate matter being seen in drug product vials of its Covid-19 vaccine,” Moderna said.The US is projected to see nearly 100,000 more deaths between now and December 1, according to the nation’s most closely watched forecasting model. “Behaviour is really going to determine if, when and how sustainably the current wave subsides,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, director of the University of Texas Covid-19 Modelling Consortium. “We cannot stop Delta in its tracks, but we can change our behaviour overnight.”Vaccinations in Africa tripled over the past week, though protecting even 10% of the continent by the end of September remains “a very daunting task”, the Africa director of WHO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-deaths-worldwide-near-4-5mn-mark-101630014020328.html
27-08-2021||World||Trump, Republican lawmakers lash out at Biden after Kabul attack||Former president Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers lashed out at Democratic President Joe Biden on Thursday after 12 US troops were killed and 15 wounded in suicide bombings in Kabul.Trump, who has been sharply critical of Biden's handling of the Afghan crisis, called Thursday's suicide attacks in Kabul a "tragedy" and said they should have been prevented."This tragedy should never have been allowed to happen, which makes our grief even deeper and more difficult to understand," said Trump, whose administration -- in a February 2020 deal with the Taliban -- committed the United States to a full withdrawal from Afghanistan.Several Republican lawmakers said Biden should resign or be impeached."Joe Biden is responsible," said Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri. "It is now clear beyond all doubt that he has neither the capacity nor the will to lead. He must resign."Representative Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking Republican in the House, tweeted that "Joe Biden has blood on his hands.""The buck stops with the President of the United States," Stefanik said."This horrific national security and humanitarian disaster is solely the result of Joe Biden's weak and incompetent leadership. He is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief."The Republican minority leader of the House of Representatives urged Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker, to call the chamber back from recess to address the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan."It is time for Congress to act quickly to save lives," Representative Kevin McCarthy said. "Our enemies have taken advantage of the chaotic nature of the withdrawal."McCarthy said Pelosi "must bring Congress back into session before August 31 so that we can be briefed thoroughly and comprehensively by the Biden administration."McCarthy also called on Biden to "take decisive action to protect our troops, our citizens, and our allies without regard for an arbitrary deadline."Speaking on Tuesday -- two days before the attack on Kabul airport -- Biden said he was sticking with his plan to complete the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan by August 31.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell called the Kabul attack "enraging" and said "we need to redouble our global efforts to confront these barbarian enemies who want to kill our Americans and attack our homeland."A suicide bombing at Kabul airport, where an international airlift has been underway since the Taliban seized power, and another at a nearby hotel killed 12 US servicemen and wounded 15 on Thursday, according to the Pentagon, along with an unspecified number of Afghans.Drew Hammill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, dismissed McCarthy's call as an "empty stunt" and said the Biden administration has repeatedly briefed members of Congress.In a statement, Pelosi ignored McCarthy's call for the House to be called back from recess but said Congress "must continue to be kept closely informed" about developments in Afghanistan.The House adjourned for its fall recess on August 24 and is scheduled to return on September 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-republican-lawmakers-lash-out-at-biden-after-kabul-attack-101630013666228.html
27-08-2021||World||‘Everything is chaos here at the moment’||A former British Royal Marine who runs an animal shelter in Afghanistan says he and his staff were caught up in the aftermath of the explosion near the Kabul airport.Paul “Pen” Farthing said the group was outside the airport when the blast occurred on Thursday. “We’re fine but everything is chaos here at the moment,” he told Britain’s Press Association news agency. “All of a sudden we heard gunshots and our vehicle was targeted, had our driver not turned around he would have been shot in the head by a man with an AK-47.“We’ve been in the airport, and back out of the airport; the whole thing’s a mess,” he added.Farthing is trying to get staff of his Nowzad charity out of Afghanistan, along with the group’s rescued animals.They have been stuck outside Kabul’s airport as they try to get a flight out. He spoke just after the first reports emerged of two suicide bombings outside the airport.UK tells airlines to avoid flying below 25,000 feetBritain has issued a notice to airlines to avoid flying below 25,000 feet (7,620 metres) over Afghanistan after the twin attacks near Kabul airport on Thursday. “Following the shocking scenes in Afghanistan today, I have issued a NOTAM (Notice to Aviation) further advising airlines to avoid Afghan airspace under 25,000ft,” said Grant Shapps, the transport minister. “We will continue to keep this under review.”German Chancellor calls off trip to IsraelChancellor Angela Merkel has called off a planned weekend visit to Israel because of the situation in Afghanistan, the German government announced on Thursday.Merkel was due to travel to Israel on Saturday for her first trip to the country since Naftali Bennett succeeded Benjamin Netanyahu as the country’s prime minister. Her visit had been due to last until Monday.It was called off in consultation with PM Bennett “because of current developments in Afghanistan,” Merkel’s office said in a statement.Germany is one of the countries that has been scrambling to evacuate from Kabul its own nationals and Afghans who helped its forces during a nearly-two decade deployment in the country.Merkel’s office said the intention is for the chancellor to go ahead with her visit at an unspecified later time. Merkel is approaching the end of her time in office. She isn’t running in Germany’s national election on September 26 but it isn’t yet clear when she will step down. In Germany, the outgoing government stays in office until a new one is sworn in, and forming a coalition can be a time-consuming process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/everything-is-chaos-here-at-the-moment-101630013502172.html
27-08-2021||World||Terror in heart of Kabul, explosions rock airport||A group of suicide attackers and gunmen targeted crowds outside the Kabul airport amid a massive and chaotic evacuation effort from Afghanistan on Thursday, killing 64 people including four US troops, according to The Wall Street Journal, and raising serious questions about the security of flights by countries such as the US and India.The attackers, including two suicide bombers, launched their assault at a gate where crowds of Afghans had gathered to get into the airport, the only way out of the country since it was taken over by the Taliban on August 15.“We can confirm that a number of US service members were killed in today’s complex attack on Kabul airport,” said Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby. “A number of others are being treated for wounds,” he said, calling it a “heinous attack”.A senior Afghan official told WSJ that at least 60 Afghans were killed in the attack, with many more wounded,US officials said they were concerned that further attacks could occur at the airport following the twin blasts, which a Taliban official earlier on Thursday said killed between 13 to 20 people, including children.Western officials had warned of a major attack, urging people to leave the airport, but that advice went largely unheeded by Afghans desperate to escape the country in the last few days of an American-led evacuation before the US officially ends its 20-year presence on August 31.There was no claim of responsibility for the attack. Reuters cited a source familiar with US congressional briefings as saying that American officials strongly believe the Afghan affiliate of Islamic State, known as Islamic State-Khorasan, was responsible.The attack came just a day after a group of 140 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus was barred from accessing Kabul airport by the Taliban. The group was scheduled to join others on a military flight that was set to bring back more than 180 people to New Delhi, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The flight subsequently brought back 24 Indians and 11 Nepalese citizens from Kabul. The people cited above said it was too early to say whether India would mount more evacuation flights from Kabul before the August 31 deadline for the complete drawdown of US and foreign forces from Afghanistan.There was no official response from the Indian side to the attack, which came in the wake of several reports of a possible attack by the Islamic State on Kabul airport. A small team of Indian officials continues to be deployed at the airport to coordinate with other countries for the evacuation effort.Two explosionsPentagon spokesperson John Kirby initially tweeted that an explosion at Abbey gate of Kabul airport was the “result of a complex attack that resulted in a number of US & civilian casualties”. He also confirmed another explosion “at or near the Baron Hotel”, located a short distance from Abbey gate.Abbey gate was the entrance being used by American citizens for evacuation flights. Baron Hotel, located about 300 metres from the site of the first explosion, was being used by British troops as a base for evacuating UK citizens. There were reports that foreign troops began sealing and welding shut the airport gate.Videos and photos following the attack showed dozens of people lying prone in pools of blood outside the airport, including in a sewage canal near the perimeter fence where scores of Afghans had lined up for their documents to be checked. The videos suggested that the toll could be higher than the official figures. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said: “The blast at Kabul airport will indeed complicate the evacuation process. While it’s not clear who carried out the suicide attack, what’s clear is that it was designed to drive away or empty out the surging crowds at the airport waiting for evacuation. It’s also a signal to the civilians that there will be consequences if they try to flee the Taliban rule.”Biden holds meetingThe United States has been racing to carry out the airlift before its military is set to fully withdraw from the country by August 31. There was no indication from the White House that Biden plans to change the August 31 withdrawal target as a result of the attacks, a source familiar with the situation said.Biden was in a meeting with security officials about the situation in Afghanistan, where the US is in the final steps of ending its 20-year war, when the explosion was first reported, according to a person familiar with the matter.Biden, secretary of state Tony Blinken, defense secretary Lloyd Austin, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman General Mark Milley and vice president Kamala Harris monitored events via video links.In an alert issued on Wednesday, the US Embassy in Kabul had advised citizens to avoid travelling to the airport and said those already at the gates should leave immediately, citing unspecified “security threats”.A Western diplomat in Kabul said that areas outside the airport gates had been “incredibly crowded” again despite the warnings.Taliban ‘condemn’ attackViolence from Islamic State, if confirmed, creates a headache for the Taliban who have promised that their victory will bring peace to Afghanistan at last. Fighters claiming allegiance to IS began appearing in eastern Afghanistan at the end of 2014 and have established a reputation for extreme brutality.The Taliban did not identify the attackers, but a spokesperson described them as “evil circles”.“We strongly condemn this gruesome incident and will take every step to bring the culprits to justice,” said Taliban official Suhail Shaheen on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/terror-in-heart-of-kabul-explosions-rock-airport-101630013358160.html
27-08-2021||World||Afghanistan: ISIS claims responsibility as dozens die in Kabul airport blasts||Two Islamic State suicide bombers attacked crowds of people gathered outside Kabul airport Thursday hoping to flee Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, killing dozens including 12 US troops, the Pentagon said.The country's new Taliban rulers said the blasts killed between 13 and 20 people. A health official in the previous government said the toll could rise to 60.The blasts came as the August 31 deadline looms for the United States to withdraw its troops, and for it and other Western countries to end a massive airlift that has already evacuated nearly 100,000 people.The airport is the only part of the country under foreign control following the Taliban's return to power on August 15, and huge crowds have massed in the hope of being evacuated.Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban's main spokesman, told AFP that "between 13 and 20" people were killed and 52 wounded in the twin blasts, while Kabul hospitals reported six dead and up to 90 wounded.A health official in the pre-Taliban administration said the death toll could rise to 60, but said he could not be named and other sources could not confirm the figure.Twelve US troops were killed in the attack and 15 wounded, said General Kenneth McKenzie, head of the US Central Command.He said the blasts have been assessed as coming from Islamic State suicide bombers, and that the US airlift would continue despite the attack."ISIS will not deter us from accomplishing the mission," he said.The United States expects more Islamic State attacks in Kabul and is prepared to retaliate, McKenzie told a news conference.US President Joe Biden had earlier cited an "acute" terrorist threat from the regional chapter of the Islamic State jihadist group.The Taliban condemned the blasts, and said they happened in an area under US military control."The Islamic Emirate strongly condemns the bombing targeting civilians at Kabul airport," said a statement released by Mujahid on Twitter.'Total panic'Graphic video shared on social media showed bodies lying semi-submerged in a canal adjacent to the airport, where thousands have gathered since the Taliban takeover of August 15 hoping for a flight out.Also Read | India condemns Kabul airport attack"When people heard the (first) explosion there was total panic," a man name Milad told AFP."The Taliban then started firing in the air to disperse the crowd. I saw a man rushing with an injured baby in his hands."The US government and its allies had raised the alarm earlier in the day with a series of advisories warning their citizens to avoid the airport.No specifics were given, but Belgium's Prime Minister Alexander De Croo referred to a threat from suicide bombers.London also issued a warning to its citizens, saying "if you can leave Afghanistan safely by other means, you should do so immediately".'Truly heartbreaking'There were reports on social media late Thursday of a third blast north of the airport, but further details were not immediately available.After the blasts, images posted on social media showed men ferrying injured people to safety in wheelbarrows.In another picture, a boy was seen clutching the arm of a man whose clothes were soaked in blood.In the confusion after the first blast Thursday, one man said he dropped the documents he hoped would help him board a flight with his wife and three children."I will never ever want to go (to the airport) again. Death to America, its evacuation and visas," he said.More than 95,000 Afghans and foreigners have fled Afghanistan via the US-led airlift since the hardline Taliban movement took control of the country.Despite security warnings, huge crowds of people desperate to flee the Taliban continued to throng the airport, their bid for a way out becoming increasingly anxious ahead of next Tuesday's deadline set by Biden to end evacuations and withdraw troops.Biden has not budged on the hard deadline -- even as some foreign nations warned they would be forced to leave at-risk Afghans behind.Shortly after the blasts the White House said Biden was being briefed on the attack, delaying a planned meeting with Israel's visiting prime minister and cancelling another event.Several Western allies have already wrapped up their airlift operations including Canada, whose government said it was "truly heartbreaking" to leave behind those who wanted to be rescued.Germany's defence minister said Berlin has pulled out all its soldiers, while Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the "heinous" attack.Islamic State threatIn recent years, the Islamic State's Afghanistan-Pakistan chapter has been responsible for some of the deadliest attacks in those countries.It has massacred civilians at mosques, shrines, public squares and even hospitals.The group has especially targeted Muslims from sects it considers heretical, including Shiites.But while IS and the Taliban are both hardline Sunni Islamist militants, they are rivals and oppose each other.The Taliban have promised a softer brand of rule from their first stint in power, which ended in 2001 when the United States invaded because they gave sanctuary to Al-Qaeda.But many Afghans fear a repeat of the Taliban's brutal interpretation of sharia law, as well as violent retribution for working with foreign militaries, Western missions or the previous US-backed government.There are particular concerns for women, who were largely banned from education and employment and could only leave the house with a male chaperone during the group's 1996-2001 rule.Some of the Afghans massed outside the airport have foreign passports, visas or eligibility to travel, but most do not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/isis-claims-responsibility-as-dozens-die-in-kabul-airport-blasts-101630008548607.html
27-08-2021||India||BRICS nations call for differentiated responsibilities on climate change||New Delhi: The BRICS nations—Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, released a New Delhi Statement on Environment at the 7th meeting of BRICS environment ministers on Friday, emphasising the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) that means countries will act on climate change based on their respective capabilities.The statement said BRICS countries will cooperate closely ahead of the critical UN climate change negotiations (COP 26) and underlined that developed countries will have to honour their financial commitment of USD 100 billion per year to developing countries for climate change mitigation. “We agree to cooperate closely in the run up to the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC COP26) in the United Kingdom and the 15th meeting of the Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD COP15) in China. We took note of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group 1 contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report and noted that it is a clarion call for rapid, sustained and effective science-based responses to climate change,” the statement said.“We underscored the need to honour the commitments made by developed countries in the pre-2020 period even as we have moved into the post-2020 era, including the yearly US$ 100 billion goal for climate finance. We noted with grave concern the proposals for introducing trade barriers, such as unilateral carbon border adjustment, that are discriminatory,” it added. On March 10, the European Parliament adopted a resolution titled: “A WTO-compatible EU carbon border adjustment mechanism” which will put a carbon price on imports of a targeted selection of products so that ambitious climate action in Europe does not lead to ‘carbon leakage,’ according to the European Commission.The ministers acknowledged the importance of global action against climate change by recognizing the “fundamental equality of all people in accessing economic growth and sustainable development.” The statement also acknowledged the need to address marine plastic litter, cleaning of rivers, biodiversity and forest cover management.Union environment minister, Bhupender Yadav who chaired the meeting stated that India gives great importance to BRICS—”2021 is a very crucial year not only for the BRICS but for the whole world as well, as we have UN Biodiversity COP 15 in October and UNFCCC COP 26 in November. BRICS Countries can play a very significant role in addressing the contemporary global challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss, air pollution, marine plastic litter, etc.”COP 26 President Alok Sharma had met Yadav and other ministers earlier this month regarding raising ambition ahead of COP 26. Sharma in an interview to Hindustan Times had said “We want every country to set out plans to go to net-zero by the middle of the century.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brics-nations-call-for-differentiated-responsibilities-on-climate-change-101630088849920.html

His timing today was, however, the same as his heats timing yesterday--46.9 sec.Finishing five metres ahead of his colleague, Milkha Singh did not strain much to amprove upon his timing of yesterday.At close today, India had a tally of four gold medals, national champion, Malwa, having been adjudged winner in the flyweight division of the wrestling championships. Genpat Andalkar claimed a gold medal in the heavyweight class.India's first gold medal had come on Saturday when Tarlok Singh had claimed the 10,000 metres.But the expectation that Tarlok Singh might return a 'double' did not come true as he finished third in the 5,000 metres and had to be content with the bronze medal in this event.The 5,000 metres turned out to be a struggle between Tarlok Singh, Pakistan's Mubarak Shah and Japan's Yokomizo.Tarlok, who was leading till the last three rounds, was cleverly overtaken by the Pakistani who set up a terrific pace in the last lap to finish 20 metres ahead of the second placed Japanese.All the three athletes in this race broke the Asian timing of 14 min. 39.4 sec.Tarlok's timing of 14 min. 31.4 sec. was, however, better than his Indian performance.Local hero, Mohammad Sarengat gave another gold medal to his country today when he prevailed in a photo-finish with Ghulam Razak, of Pakistan, to win the 110 metres hurdles in the record timing of 14.3 see.India's decathlon participant, Gurbachan Singh, finished fifth in this event.Both Amrit Pal and Mohinder easily won their respective heats in the 1,500 metres to make sure of the first two places in the final tomorrow.In volleyball, India became the winners of Pool B when they defeated Cambodia 15-10, 15-6, 15-5.

Since these special coaches are aimed at sleeper class passengers, the fare was a tricky issue as it has to be lower than normal AC 3-tier fare but higher than sleeper class fare. Reports said, the base fare for up to 300 km will be ₹440 which is the lowest according to the distance, while the highest base fare is ₹3,065 for 4,951 to 5,000 km.The first Economy AC 3 tier coach will be fitted in a special Prayagraj-Jaipur Express, reports said.The air-conditioned three-tier economy coaches are being seen as a gamechanger as they will offer the best AC travel at the cheapest price, the railways claimed earlier. According to the railways' plan, around 806 new coaches are to be rolled out by this fiscal, either by this year or at the beginning of the next year. "By the end of 2021, or in 2022, we will 806 AC three-tier economy class coaches. All our coach factories will work simultaneously to manufacture these coaches. The Railways is getting future-ready and will ensure that all passengers get better travelling experience than ever before," a railway official earlier said.The AC and the fare are not the best features of these coaches as the railways promised improved design, individual AC vents for each berth etc. The features of these special coaches include the modular design of seats, individual reading points, mobile charging points, more headroom for the upper and the middle berths.But how will it be feasible for the railways? In the newly designed coaches, there is a 15 per cent increase in the numbet of berths than regular AC coaches as the railways has converted the side two berths into three berths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-railways-economy-ac-3-tier-fares-to-be-8-less-than-normal-ac-fare-101630084014434.html

27-08-2021||India||Samyukt Kisan Morcha calls for 'Bharat Bandh' on September 25||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, spearheading the anti-farm laws protests, on Friday called for a 'Bharat Bandh' on September 25.The SKM said the move is aimed at further strengthening and expanding the farmers' agitation which completed nine months on Thursday.Addressing a press conference at Delhi's Singhu border, Ashish Mittal from SKM said, "We are calling for a 'Bharat bandh' on September 25. This is happening after a similar 'bandh' was organised on the same date last year, and we hope that it would be more successful than the one last year which was held amid the Covid-19 pandemic."Mittal, who was also the convener of the all-India convention by farmers that concluded on Friday, said the two-day event was a success, and saw the participation of representatives from 22 states, of not just 300 farm unions but also members of organisations that work for the welfare of women, labourers, tribals as well as youth and students.During the convention, discussions and deliberations took place on the farmers' struggle that has been going on for the last nine months, and it focused on making their agitation against the farm laws a pan-India movement, he said."During this convention we understood how the government has been attacking the farming community with the pro-corporate laws, and how by capturing the market, farmers' produce will be bought at lower prices."The government which is on the verge of bankruptcy, is trying to recover the money from the farmers, labourers and the common man by increasing the fuel prices and prices of cooking gas. All these anti-public steps are to benefit the corporate. It is important to strengthen our agitation against all of these factors," Mittal said.He added that their demands for repeal of the three farm laws, legal guarantee for MSP of all crops, repeal of Electricity Bill, 2021, and no prosecution of farmers under the 'Commission of AQ Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas Bill 2021' were also reiterated during the convention.Mittal also elaborated on the farmers' upcoming rally in Uttar Pradesh scheduled to take place in Muzaffarnagar on September 5, saying it is expected to witness the participation by lakhs of people."A call for strengthening this movement will be made from there. The movement will be taken to every zila there, and we have appealed to people to participate in large numbers."We have also appealed to farmer and labour organisations at the zila and lower levels to come together and discuss the impact of these laws and create a collective agitation across the country," he said.On Thursday, the farmers' protest against the three contentious laws completed nine months since they first arrived at the Delhi borders. The farmers have been demanding the repeal of the laws which they are afraid will do away with the MSP system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government that has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/samyukt-kisan-morcha-calls-for-bharat-bandh-on-september-25-101630081712415.html

This is an evolving situation. Making long-term plans has not been the best of ideas,” Union ministry of home affairs (MEA) spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told news agency ANI.This comes in the aftermath of India announcing that all Afghan nationals must arrive in the country only on the emergency e-visas, which was announced by the home ministry on August 17 in view of the Taliban taking over Afghanistan after two decades.Bagchi further told reporters during a weekly press briefing that more than 550 people have so far been flown out of Afghanistan by India on six independent flights – either from Kabul or Tajikistan’s capital Dushanbe. “Of these, over 260 were Indians. The government also facilitated the evacuation of Indian nationals through other agencies. We were in touch with various countries like [the] US and Tajikistan,” he added.Referring to the deportation of an Afghan woman MP Rangina Kargar, who claimed she was treated “as a criminal” in India, Baghchi cited “confusion over the e-Emergency visa system” to be the reason behind the incident and termed it as “unfortunate.”Also Read | Afghan woman MP complains she was 'treated like criminal', deported from India: Reports“There were reports of a group of people who raided one of our outsourcing agencies where Afghan passports with Indian visas were there,” he told reporters.A senior official on Thursday said that over 1,000 visas issued by the Indian embassy were reportedly stolen in Afghanistan due to which more than 11,000 visas given to Afghans between August 12 and 14, were cancelled. According to a separate ANI report, India has issued around 300 e-visas to Afghans so far.The official also said that intelligence agencies had anticipated the stolen visas could be misused amid the situation in Afghanistan.Also Read | Over 1,000 visas issued by Indian embassy were stolen in Afghanistan: ReportBagchi also said that India was able to evacuate “some Afghan nationals as well as [those] from other countries,” and that several of them were Sikhs and Hindus. “Primarily, our focus will be on Indian nationals, but we’ll also stand by Afghans who stood by us,” he was quoted as saying.Throwing light on the overall evacuation process, the home ministry spokesperson said that the “vast majority of Indians” who wish to return have been flown out of Afghanistan. “I don’t have the exact number for that,” Bagchi added.The evacuation deadline for foreign nationals and Afghans are only a few days away after the US President recently reinstated his move to stick to August 31, even as allied forces pushed him for an extension. His reaffirmation had come soon after the Taliban gave an ultimatum that an extension would invite “consequences.”Meanwhile, explosions at Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport on Thursday, which was claimed by the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISIS-K), reportedly caused the death of at least 90 Afghans and 13 US Marines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-best-of-ideas-centre-on-not-allowing-long-term-stay-to-afghan-nationals-101630080116290.html
27-08-2021||India||CBI teams visit more Bengal families to investigate post-poll violence||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday recorded the statements of some families in at least three districts of West Bengal while carrying out an investigation into post-poll violence, said officials aware of the development. The investigation was ordered by the Calcutta high court on July 19. Two CBI teams went to South 24 Parganas and Nadia districts; while a third team revisited the home of Jaiprakash Yadav, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker who died in a bomb attack by motorcycle-borne assailants at Bhatpara in North 24 Parganas district on June 6. A fourth team is supposed to leave for north Bengal. Each of these four teams --- which comprise deputy inspector generals and superintendents from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Karnataka and other states – is being headed by a joint director. All the officers have arrived in Bengal. The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is providing security to the visiting teams. A CBI team recorded the statements of Yadav’s parents on Thursday. “On Friday, the family was asked to identify the victim’s blood-soaked clothes which were kept in the custody of Bhatpara police station. This was done because Yadav’s face was mutilated beyond recognition by the bomb that hit him on the head,” a CBI officer stationed in Kolkata said on condition of anonymity. Members of the four CBI teams did not talk to the media in any of the districts they visited. On Thursday, they visited Kolkata, Purulia, Nadia and Bankura districts and registered nine first information reports (FIR). One of these was in connection with BJP worker Abhijit Sarkar’s murder in Kolkata’s Narkeldanga area on May 2. The Kolkata Police has so far arrested seven people in this case. On Friday, CBI officers who visited Nadia district talked to the family of BJP worker Palas Mandal who was killed on June 14 in Krishnanagar town. In South 24 Parganas district, the officers met some families in the Usthi area that witnessed violence after Trinamool Congress (TMC) swept the polls. On June 18, the Calcutta high court asked the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to probe the allegations of murders, rapes, extortion and arson that were raised from across the state after the March-April state polls in which the BJP won 77 seats against 213 bagged by the TMC. The BJP has alleged that 36 of its workers have been killed since May 2. After studying the final report the NHRC filed on July 13, the high court, on August 19, ordered a CBI probe into allegations of murder and rape and a parallel probe into the other offences by a three-member special investigation team (SIT) comprising IPS officers posted in Bengal. The NHRC recommended a CBI probe and hearing of the cases outside Bengal. The state government told the court that the NHRC report was biased and prepared with a political motive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-teams-visit-more-bengal-families-to-investigate-post-poll-violence-101630080570428.html

27-08-2021||India||Pilot of plane hijacked in 1999 says Afghan airspace very risky, explains why||Taliban ground fighters do not follow rules and hence Afghan airspace remains very risky, Captain Devi Sharan, the former Air India pilot whose IC-814 was hijacked to Kandahar in December 1999 said at a time India is operating evacuation flights to and from Kabul. India has been allowed two evacuation flights daily as the airspace remains restricted. Back-to-back blasts near Kabul airport on Thursday threatened the security of the evacuation drive countries are continuing, but threats are in the airspace as well, Sharan said."There is a lot of grey area. We have to always monitor the corridor route which we are following because the Taliban government says something and somewhere down their forces are doing something else. In such a situation, entering Afghanistan's airspace is very risky. They can always shoot the aircraft down," Sharan told ANI."I have operated many times over Afghanistan while flying to Europe and the USA. Whenever we used to hear the voice of air traffic controllers who were mainly American people, it used to give us a sense of security. We never felt the need to take an alternate route due to an emergency while we used to be en-route Kabul and Kandahar. We were quite comfortable if we had to land in Kabul or Kandahar in case of a technical emergency. We were quite satisfied with that because we used to listen to American traffic controllers on ATC," said Captain Devi.Earlier, Devi Sharan had said that he did not find any change in the Taliban fighters after the fall of Kabul on August 15, from their photos and videos. Seeing Taliban fighters roaming with weapons on Kabul street, Devi Sharan remembered the fighters who surrounded his hijacked plane in Kandahar and said that unlike the claims made about a refined Taliban 2.0, he could hardly spot any difference.On resuming air operations between India and Kabul, Devi Sharan said, "If our government and their government make sure that no untowardly incident will take place and everything is safe, then only we should resume air operations otherwise we should not take the risk."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilot-of-plane-hijacked-in-1999-says-afghan-airspace-very-risky-explains-why-101630076122683.html
27-08-2021||India||Considering possibility of more evacuation flights from Kabul: India on Afghan crisis||India is considering the possibility of mounting more evacuation flights to bring back nationals still in Afghanistan even as the government has adopted a cautious approach to recognising any new set-up in Kabul in view of the fluid situation there. At least 20 Indian nationals and some 140 Afghan Sikhs and Hindus were unable to access Kabul airport to board a military evacuation flight on Wednesday, reportedly due to impediments created by the Taliban. The security situation at the airport has taken a turn for the worse after Thursday’s devastating suicide attack by the Islamic State-Khorasan that killed nearly 100 people, including 13 US military personnel. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi declined to give an exact number for Indian citizens who are still in Afghanistan, saying the figure changes as requests come in from people to be evacuated, though he acknowledged that at least 20 Indians had missed the flight from Kabul on Wednesday. “Our overall assessment is that the vast majority of Indians who wished to return have been evacuated, but of course, some more are likely to be in Afghanistan. I don’t have an exact number for that,” he told a regular weekly news briefing on Friday. Describing the situation on the ground as “very difficult”, he said India is in touch with “various parties regarding when we can mount evacuation flights”. The last evacuation flight had about 40 people, and there were reports that Afghan nationals were facing difficulties in reaching the airport. “Some Indians, say around 20...were also trying to reach [the airport] and as you’ve seen the kind of chaos at the airport, they could not reach. And so our flight had to come without these Indian nationals,” he said. Indian evacuation flights have so far brought back more than 550 people, including more than 260 Indians, from Kabul or Dushanbe. The government has also facilitated the evacuation of Indians through other countries. These evacuation efforts have involved coordination with several countries, particularly the US, which controls Kabul airport, and Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Iran. While the current focus is on the safe evacuation of people, India, like other countries, has adopted a wait and watch attitude on the issue of recognising any Taliban regime in Kabul. “The situation on the ground is uncertain...Currently, there is a lack of clarity or no clarity about any entity forming a government in Kabul. I think we are jumping the gun here regarding recognition,” Bagchi said. “We continue to monitor the situation very carefully,” he said, adding there various reports about whether the next set-up in Kabul will be inclusive and whether other elements of Afghan polity will find representation in it. “There is a peace process, and discussions are ongoing now. Let’s wait and see how it develops,” he said. Bagchi reiterated that India will “stand by Afghans who stood by us”, and said a recent incident of an Afghan MP being sent back to Turkey after she travelled to New Delhi on her diplomatic passport was the outcome of “confusion”. After the security situation deteriorated following the Taliban takeover on August 15, groups of people raided one of India’s outsourcing agencies handling Afghan passports with Indian visas. “In the light of the loss of Afghan passports containing Indian visas, our authorities were in a state of high alert,” he said, adding that the resultant confusion led to the “unfortunate incident of denial of entry” to the Afghan MP. Responding to a question on the status of Afghans who enter India through a new emergency e-visa regime, Bagchi said they would be allowed to stay in the country for six months. “We will take it from there...that’s the current plan for six months. This is an evolving situation, I think making long-term plans has not been the best of ideas considering the changes of the last few days,” he said. “India has always been a place where people have come in times of distress; people have come here before this problem started. Discussions are going on to see what can be the modalities, how to deal with Afghans already here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/considering-possibility-of-more-evacuation-flights-from-kabul-india-on-afghan-crisis-101630076849991.html

Writing for CPI(M) magazine 'Chintha', Pinarayi accused government critics of neglecting facts and deliberately creating confusion.“There are some unnecessary controversies surrounding the second wave. Some sections are trying to create fear among people by portraying the high numbers during the second wave as a cause of concern,” he wrote.Union minister V Muraleedharan has been leading the attack against the Pinarayi-led government over the spike in Covid-19 cases. He has repeatedly accused the state government of not following the health guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).On Thursday, the minister of state for external affairs urged the Kerala government to follow the guidelines prescribed by the ICMR for tackling the pandemic."The state, instead of using scientific methods to contain the spread, is trying to use pandemic for political objectives. I urge it to follow ICMR guidelines," Muraleedharan told news agency ANI.Also Read | Kerala using Covid-19 for political goals: What Union Minister said on spikeThe Kerala government has been facing flak over the Covid-19 response as the state continues to report the highest number of daily new infections in India. On Friday, Kerala reported more than 32,000 new Covid cases and 179 related deaths in the last 24 hours. The test positivity rate continues to hover around 19%.“If Kerala model is wrong in covid containment, then which model should we follow?” asked Pinarayi. “No one had died in Kerala due to a lack of oxygen. No person was deprived of medical aid or medical bed.”Highlighting the results of previous seroprevalence studies, Pinarayi said that Kerala has the least percentage of the population infected. He added that the southern state did not waste a “single drop of vaccine and successfully inoculated extra doses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-one-died-of-oxygen-shortage-pinarayi-defends-kerala-model-amid-criticism-101630069861238.html
27-08-2021||India||Once a TMC ally, Darjeeling Gorkha leader to launch new political party||Anit Thapa, a former general secretary of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM), which is an ally of West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), said on Friday that he will launch a new political party in Darjeeling next month. “I will make the announcement on September 9. Many intellectuals and literary personalities will join it,” said Thapa who, along with his associates, sided with the TMC government in 2017 when it cracked down on the Gorkhaland movement, forcing GJM founder Bimal Gurung to go underground. Gurung resurfaced in 2020 and offered to support Mamata Banerjee in the assembly polls held in March-April this year. Since 2017, Thapa was the general secretary of the GJM faction that was headed by Binoy Tamang, Gurung’s lieutenant-turned-rival. On July 15, Tamang resigned and handed over the party’s flag to Gurung. He has held meetings with Gurung as well. “I offer my best wishes to Thapa. I hope his party will be corruption-free,” Tamang said on Friday. In 2019, the state government made Thapa the chairman of the board of administrators of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), a semi-autonomous development body, after Tamang stepped down from the post to contest the assembly by-election in Darjeeling. He lost to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Thapa was removed from the GTA before the recent assembly polls and since then the autonomous body is being run by a senior bureaucrat. Since 1986, Darjeeling and Kalimpong have witnessed four movements in support of the demand for Gorkhaland, a separate state for Gorkhas. The regional parties are now divided. Some have forged an alliance with the BJP while the rest support the TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/once-a-tmc-ally-darjeeling-gorkha-leader-to-launch-new-political-party-101630069169389.html

Thakur was booked on the basis of the findings of a two-member committee that was constituted after the woman and her associate set themselves on fire outside the Supreme Court on August 16. The two later succumbed to their injuries. Minutes before their self-immolation, the two in a Facebook Live levelled allegations against at least five police officers of harassing her to save Rai in the rape case.

During Covid-19, they didn’t take any action. [Bollywood actor] Sushant Singh (Rajput) was murdered. Disha Salian was raped and killed, [and] yet the perpetrators roam freely,” Rane was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The union minister further said that Shiv Sainiks, who had gone to his house, were welcomed by the police. “What has Shiv Sena given to [the] Konkan region in [the] last two years? They thought I would be scared if they took action against me. But our journey has been successful,” he told ANI.Rane also addressed Sena leader Sanjay Raut’s “West Bengal is the tiger of the country” remark, saying that the former “speaks without any sense.” “Vinayak and Sanjay Raut will lead to the fall of Shiv Sena…The difference between Konkan and Kashmir is the same between making Mamata Banerjee the Prime Minister,” he added.What does the 'won't let Maharashtra become West Bengal' statement (by Narayan Rane) mean?

This is the second time since May 20, the peak of the second wave, that the state recorded over 30,000 fresh cases in 24 hours. Given the surge in the cases, the state government decided to bring back Sunday lockdown, which was done away with in the last two weeks because of the Independence Day and Onam celebrations.Kerala's Covid situation has deteriorated with the state seeing an Onam spike. State health minister Veena George put the blame on home isolation and recently said that a majority of the people are getting infected from their family members as infected people are not following containment rules properly in home isolation.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan too dismissed the constant attack on Kerala's Covid management as 'unwanted' and said that these are deliberate attempts to undermine people's fight against the pandemic. "These moves were to trigger public sentiments against the government and thus create a situation in which the fight against the virus infection was viewed lightly by the people," the chief minister wrote in the latest edition of the party's mouthpiece."In Kerala, not a single person had died due to the dearth of oxygen. No one has been denied access to health services or anyone faced a situation of not getting a hospital bed during emergencies," the CM wrote adding that those who are criticising Kerala's model are not aware that the second wave started a bit late in the state.The Union home secretary chaired a meeting on Thursday with the state government officials of Kerala and Maharashtra as these are the two states with an unusual graph of Covid at present. The Centre also suggested placing a night curfew in areas of high positivity. Cases of reinfections have been found to be higher in Kerala than in other states, which contributed to the ongoing surge that started in the last week of July. Another peak just after Onam was predicted and the state government was alerted accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-over-32-000-fresh-covid-infections-kerala-sees-another-surge-brings-back-sunday-lockdown-101630068504640.html
27-08-2021||India||Police can further probe Kodanad case, rules Madras high court||In another setback for former Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami, the Madras high court on Friday gave the go-ahead to police to conduct further investigation in the 2017 Kodanad heist-cum-murder case which is currently in the trial stage. Justice M Nirmal Kumer passed the orders while dismissing a petition filed by prosecution witness N Ravi seeking a direction to police to stop conducting fresh investigations. The court said the petitioner has no locus standi to oppose further investigations. The petitioner, who is also the joint secretary of AIADMK’s wing Amma Peravai in Coimbatore district had also sought for the trial at the Nilgiris sessions court to be fast-tracked and conducted on a day-to-day basis. Though Palaniswami is not a party in the case, the order is seen as a setback for him as he has repeatedly claimed that the DMK has begun fresh investigations to frame him and other AIADMK leaders. Also Read | 27% for OBC in medical colleges gets HC nodIn 2019, key accused KV Sayan alleged Palaniswami’s involvement in the crime. The DMK had then sought Palaniswami’s resignation even as the latter had denied the charge. This August 17, Nilgiris police questioned Sayan, leading to a political and legal slugfest in the state. Palaniswami alleged that a ‘secret statement’ was taken from Sayan to frame him. He even led a walkout from the assembly, and complained to Governor Banwarilal Purohit. Dismissing AIADMK’s allegations of a political vendetta, chief minister MK Stalin has said it was DMK’s election promise to bring the real culprits of Kodanad case to book. The advocate general of the state, R Shanmugasundaram reiterated in court today that there is no political motive. Besides the witnesses’ plea seeking a stay on further investigations, three out of the ten accused in the case also approached the Madras high court asking for Palaniswami and V K Sasikala who co-owned the estate with late J Jayalalithaa to be questioned. The case also came up at the trial court in Nilgiris on Friday where Sayan was produced but the court decided to defer the hearing as Ravi’s plea was being heard in the high court. The trial court’s next hearing is on September 2. The next hearing in the trial court is on September 2.There are several unanswered questions in the four-year-old case. The 900-acre Kodanad tea estate in Nilgiris was Jayalalithaa’s summer retreat. She purchased it with her close confidante Sasikala and her family in the 1990s. On the intervening night of April 23 and 24, there was a break-in and the estate’s security guard was murdered. Two of the accused met with road accidents where Jayalalithaa’s former driver C Kanagaraj also died. Sayan escaped with serious injuries, but his wife and daughter died on the spot. The charge sheet stated that wristwatches and a rhinoceros miniature were stolen from the estate. This raised questions on the motive as the accused were found to have gone to the estate in high-end SUVs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-can-further-probe-kodanad-case-rules-madras-high-court-101630067309142.html
27-08-2021||India||Over 550 people, including over 260 Indians, evacuated from Afghanistan: Govt||More than 550 people have so far been evacuated from Afghanistan via six flights following the Taliban’s takeover of the country, the Indian government said on Friday. Of the 550, over 260 are Indians, the government also said.“We have evacuated over 550 people in 6 separate flights, either from Kabul or Dushanbe. Of these, over 260 were Indians. GoI also facilitated evacuation of Indian nationals through other agencies. We were in touch with various countries, like [the] US,Tajikistan,” said Arindam Bagchi, spokesperson for the ministry of external affairs (MEA), news agency ANI reported.Further, the ministry said that the “vast majority” of Indians who wanted to return from Afghanistan have been evacuated out of the country. However, Bagchi said that he did not have the exact count of people who wanted to remain in the country. “Our overall assessment is that the vast majority of Indians who wish to return have been evacuated. Some more are likely to be in Afghanistan. I do not have the exact number for that,” he said.Also read | 'We are jumping the gun': MEA on recognition of Taliban rule by IndiaBriefing more on the operations, Bagchi said that the last flight from Afghanistan had close to 40 people in it and also said that some Afghan citizens, including Afghan Sikhs and Hindus, faced difficulties in reaching the Kabul airport on August 25 and so the flight had returned without them.The primary focus of the government would be on evacuating Indian nationals who are stranded in Afghanistan, he said, adding that the government would also “stand by” Afghan nationals. “We were able to bring out some Afghan nationals as well as nationals from other countries. Of these, many of them were Sikhs and Hindus. Primarily, our focus will be on Indian nationals, but we'll also stand by Afghans who stood by us,” he said.While the ministry said that there was no clarity regarding the formation of the government in Kabul currently, it also assured that the government is monitoring the situation in Kabul “very carefully.”Meanwhile, the United Kingdom earlier on Friday said that the country’s evacuation operation at the Kabul airport was in its “final hours” and also closed processing centres near the airport for further clearance. Few other European nations such as Spain, Italy and France have also announced their plans to end operations on Friday while the US has said that it will not extend its presence on the Afghan soil after August 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-550-people-including-over-260-indians-evacuated-from-afghanistan-govt-101630064820414.html
27-08-2021||India||'We are jumping the gun': MEA on question of recognition of Taliban rule by India||The ministry of external affairs on Friday reiterated that the first priority of the government at this moment is to safely evacuate people from Afghanistan. The question of whether to recognise the Taliban rule in Afghanistan or not comes later. "The situation on the ground is uncertain (in Afghanistan). The primary concern is the security and safety of people. Currently, there is no clarity about any entity forming a government in Kabul. I think we are jumping the gun regarding recognition," MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said during a press briefing on Friday.External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Thursday briefed an all-party meeting on the Afghanistan situation where he underlined that the current stance of India is to wait and watch. At the same time, India is engaged with important stakeholders and other countries on the Afghan issue. What need to be seen first is whether the new dispensation in Afghanistan will be solely a government of the Taliban or be part of a power-sharing arrangement with other Afghan leaders, the ministry has clarified.Also Read | India’s only investment in Afghanistan is on its people, will get full-value in return: JaishankarOn August 15, the Taliban completed its capture of Afghanistan except for the Panjshir province, as Kabul fell to the hands of the group. Since then, several rounds of consultations are going on regarding the next government of Afghanistan. While initially an interim set-up was proposed, later the Taliban reportedly claimed their government and names of several ministers have been already announced. But the anti-Taliban force which has been negotiating a peace deal with the Taliban is pitching for an all-inclusive government.Unless it's cleared who is going to govern Afghanistan, the question of recognition does not arise, the external affairs ministry has made it clear. India has been in touch with countries such as the US, UK, France, Russia, China, Germany, Qatar, Iran, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan as well as with the UN Secretary-General and UN Security Council on the developments in Afghanistan, the ministry has said.Countries like China, Canada, Tajikistan have already clarified their stance on recognising or not recognising the Taliban in Afghanistan. During the Taliban's previous rule in Afghanistan, they remained antagonistic with India as India refused to recognise the Taliban government and had supported the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, led by Ahmad Shah Massoud.India's evacuation drive from Kabul will go on, Bagchi said adding that a vast majority of Indians who wanted to return have been evacuated. Some Afghan nationals have also been rescued, the spokesperson said adding that the primary focus of India will be to evacuate Indian nationals but India will also stand by Afghans who stood by Indians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-are-jumping-the-gun-mea-on-recognition-of-taliban-rule-in-india-101630064250822.html

27-08-2021||India||Green activists hail top court’s decision to curb quarrying in Kerala||Green activists and conservationists have hailed the Supreme Court order to stay the Kerala High Court verdict that allowed quarrying in a 200 metre radius of populated areas. Last August, the High Court had stayed an order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) which stipulated that quarries in the state must be at least 200 metres away from residential areas. After the HC order many new quarries came up in ecologically fragile areas and now they will have to wind up. Nature lovers feel the latest order of the SC will help cap unmindful quarrying in ecologically sensitive areas (ESA) and those close to dwelling units. Earlier the minimum distance for quarrying was 50 metres away from populated areas and later the NGT raised it to 200 metres which was stayed by the HC. The state is burdened with mindless quarrying for quite some time now posing a serious threat to fragile areas of the Western Ghats that play a crucial role in breaking rain clouds over the sub-continent. Many hills have turned barren as the powerful quarry lobby started carving them. After the 2018 floods and landslides that claimed 400-odd lives, noted environmental scientist Dr Madhav Gadgil had said it was a man-made disaster pointing accusing fingers at many illegal quarries functioning in sensitive areas of the Western Ghats. “Illegal sand mining destroyed many rivers of the state and quarrying turned many lush hills barren. It seems the state is yet to learn a lesson from recurring tragedies,” said Dr S Vijayan, one of the members of the Gadgil Committee, formed to study growing human intervention in Western Ghats.“Judicial intervention in environmental issues is paramount. Quarrying, sand mining and illegal tree felling pose a big threat to the sensitive ecology of the state,” said N Badusha, president of the Wayanad Prakruti Samrakshana Samiti. The samiti played a crucial role in exposing the recent illegal tree felling in Muttil in Wayanad (north Kerala) in the guise of a weird government order. Last year the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the official advisory committee of the UNESCO, in a report expressed serious concern over the degradation of Western Ghats. It said if immediate action was not taken to check the overexploitation rich biodiversity of the mountain ranges would be in danger. Despite many such warnings, exploitation of mountain ranges which start from Gujarat to Kerala continues. Two expert committee reports (Gadgil and Kasturirangan), intended to save the Ghats, are gathering dust at administrative offices. Fearing backlash nobody dared to touch them. The state had witnessed violent agitation against the Gadgil committee in 2012. When all six states under the periphery of the Ghats opposed the Gadgil Panel recommendations, another committee was constituted under former ISRO chief Dr Kasturirangan. A mellowed one, Kasturirangan Panel had made some changes in the zonal classification and reduced ESA to 37 per cent from the 64 per cent suggested by the earlier panel. But many states opposed the Kasturirangan panel also forcing the government to freeze both reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/green-activists-hail-top-court-s-decision-to-curb-quarrying-in-kerala-101630061908977.html

Students of classes 9 to 12 can attend physical classes from September 1, while physical classes for students of class 6 to class 8 will begin from September 8.The decision was taken at the meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Friday. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal earlier told that the government was considering reopening schools as early as possible but the final decision would be taken only after consulting all the stakeholders. "There has been a mixed experience of states which have reopened schools. We have been monitoring the situation," the Delhi CM had said.On August 6, Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal had asked officials to set up an expert panel to deliberate the reopening of schools in the national Capital.While many states opted to reopen schools in July and August, the expert panel suggested that Delhi should take more time and should reopen schools only in a phased manner starting from September. According to the suggestion of the committee, the senior classes should be called to the schools first, following the middle-level classes and the primary classes. The committee also suggested a 50 per cent cap on the number of students to be present.After reopening in February, Delhi schools were closed in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic.Online classes will continue and parents will be able to opt for online classes. Parents consulted for reopening schools were also in favour of the resumption of physical classes.The states are reopening schools amid the threat of a third wave of the pandemic as the government experts have assured that physical classes can be resumed in a staggered manner following all Covid-19 precautions as those aged below 18 are not at any greater risk of contracting the infection than other age groups. Among states which have recently reopened schools, Himachal Pradesh had to reverse the move after several students tested positive amid an overall Covid spike in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schools-in-delhi-to-reopen-from-september-1-101630057723709.html

With his farmlands all submerged under saline water, which gushed into the villages through breaches in the river embankments, the future seemed bleak. Three months down the line, Das has something to rely upon. He along with fellow villagers, whose farmlands have also turned saline, are now growing salt-tolerant varieties of paddy, which were grown in community seedbeds on higher grounds with the government’s help.“The yield could be a bit less compared to what we used to get from the high yielding variety (HYV) of paddy. But in such highly saline conditions, the HYV won’t survive. We would get at least some yield from the salt-tolerant varieties,” he said.Three cyclones - Bulbul in November 2019, Amphan in May 2020, and Yaas in May 2021 – have highlighted the state’s vulnerability to the climate crisis. Over the years, farmers living in the coastal belt of West Bengal have been gradually shifting to salt-resistant paddy.After Amphan, the West Bengal government distributed around 550MT of salt-tolerant varieties of paddy seeds to around 91,000 farmers. After Yaas, around 1200 MT of seeds were distributed in the three coastal districts.“Each farmer was given a kit comprising six kilos of seeds along with seed-treating chemicals. Six varieties of paddy seeds – CSR-10, CSR036, CSR-43, Luna Swarna, Luna Sampad, Lunishree and Dudeshwar were distributed. Luna Swarna was distributed for the first time,” said Onkar Singh Meena, secretary of the state agriculture department.Also Read | Bengal professors’ body questions rationale behind ‘drinking poison’ by teachersGovernment officials said that with this 1200MT of seeds, salt-tolerant paddy could be grown in around 38,890 hectares of farmland which in turn will benefit around 30,00,00 farmers if all goes well.“With an estimated yield of at least three MT per hectare, if not more, we are expecting that the production would be around 1.16 lakh MT. This would be worth around ₹217.9 crore instead of zero crops because of high salinity levels after the cyclone. On average an HYV paddy yields around five MT per hectare,” said an official.As cyclone Yaas coincided with the perigean spring tide, it triggered a huge storm surge up to a few metres high and saltwater gushed into the villages. Nearly 1.42 lakh hectares of farmlands in three coastal districts – East Midnapore, North 24 Parganas, and South 24 Parganas - turned saline, which is around 2.5% of the state’s total cultivable land.“While the electrical conductivity in a normal soil is less than 1 decisiemens per metre (dS/m) after Amphan and Yaas when saline water entered the villages, the electrical conductivity went up to 34 dS/m. A normal high-yielding variety of paddy crop would die if the value were more than 10 dS/m,” said a state agriculture department official.As the saline water, which entered the villages during Yaas through breaches in river embankments, took time to recede community seedbeds were formed on higher grounds where the water had receded, and the ground had dried up.The community seedbeds were prepared so that the seedlings could be raised on time and later could be transplanted in farmlands when the water receded. Each community seedbed sprawled over two to three hectares which would serve at least 150 to 200 farmers. The farmers were convinced, and they came forward in large numbers, said Chowdhury Monirul Haque, assistant director of agriculture, Sandeshkhali block - II.While on one hand, farmers were not aware of the technology on how to produce good salt tolerant paddy, another impediment was that salt-tolerant seeds were not available in the initial stages, as farmers over the past few decades had shifted to high yielding varieties. The government took up the project Nona Swarna through which salt-tolerant seeds, produced from traditional varieties and stored in government research institutes, were distributed.Awareness programmes were held through live phone-in, television, and radio talks.Conservationist Debal Deb, founder of the rice seed banks Vrihi and Basudha, has some unpleasant memories when it comes to promoting salt tolerant paddy varieties.“After Cyclone Aila hit the Sunderbans in May 2009, I distributed four varieties of salt-tolerant paddy to around 40 villagers. Our initiative continued over the next four years till 2012 covering six blocks. In all, we distributed seven varieties. The villagers adopted it but only for a few years. The moment they saw that their farmlands have become fertile again and the effect of Aila had faded, they discarded the salt-tolerant varieties and returned to the HYV. Then came Amphan and Yaas and they were hit again,” said Deb.Experts say even though cyclones have been common in the Bay of Bengal for centuries, over the years their intensity is increasing because of the warming sea surface, leading to more evaporation and stronger winds. A recent World Bank report pointed out that the long-term trend of cyclone landfalls, between 1877 and 2016, shows northern Odisha and Sunderbans are the highest-impact zones.“Our analysis is that that severity of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal has increased over the years. This, in turn, is inflicting the damage in terms of raging winds and huge storm surge,” said Tuhin Ghosh, director of the School of Oceanographic Studies, Jadavpur University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/backtoback-cyclones-prompt-bengal-farmers-to-shift-to-salt-tolerant-paddy-101630056868338.html

The alleged incident at Khulichera area in Cachar district, near the border, on Thursday came at a time when the two governments are trying to find solutions to the 164.6km-long-border dispute following the July 26 clashes that killed seven people. While Mizoram Police refuted all claims of an attack and alleged forceful construction by Assam on their land, Assam Police said the work was being carried out three kilometres away from the border. “They did not attack anyone,” Mizoram’s Kolasib district superintendent of police Vanlalfaka Ralte said. Sharing details of the alleged incident, the labourers said that they were attacked by a group of masked men carrying guns and insisted that the accused were from Mizoram. One of them alleged that the group was attacked by around 30 people with stones and slingshots. “Some of them were carrying bows and arrows and a few had guns. It looked like they planned to kill us, so we left the area. Hundreds of slingshots were fired at our vehicle and we heard a few gunshots too,” the labourer said, preferring anonymity. Cachar superintendent of police Ramandeep Kaur said the identity of the attackers were yet to be confirmed. “Since the attackers were masked, we cannot say they were from Mizoram. The area is near the inter-state border which is a no-network zone. Our workers could not call for help immediately. We need to probe the matter carefully,” he said. Kaur also said that the attack will not affect the construction work. “The rest of the work will progress as per plan, and we will provide adequate security to the workers,” he said. Ralte, however, accused Assam of forcefully holding construction work on their land. “Assam is forcibly constructing the road on Mizoram’s land which angered the people here. They moved forward and tried to stop the work but did not attack,” he said. To this, Kaur responded: “This is an Assam government-sanctioned work which cannot be in Mizoram’s territory. The work is going on under Pradhanmantri Gramin Sadak Yojana, three kilometres from the Mizoram border according to the Survey of India map. They are violating the agreement between two states and now trying to spread lies.”Meanwhile, Carolyne Pachuau, an official in Mizoram’s Kolasib district claimed the overall situation at the border had improved ever since the violent clashes between forces of the two sides last month. Over 8,000 vehicles carrying essential goods have entered the state ever since the informal economic blockade by a few Assamese groups in Lailapur was lifted on August 7, she added. Things have changed, trucks carrying essentials are entering smoothly. But common people are still a bit hesitant to cross the border. We are conducting discussions among locals from both sides. We want peace to prevail,” she said. Police forces of the two states fought a pitched gun battle at a disputed border in southern Assam on July 26, in which six Assam policemen and a civilian died. Assam claimed Mizoram police opened fire on its forces who objected to a road being constructed by Mizoram on a patch of forested land it claims. Mizoram claimed the land belongs to it.Tensions flared up immediately but eased after central intervention. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rules Assam and the Mizo National Front, a part of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance, is in power in Mizoram.Can check for political reactions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assamese-workers-allege-attack-along-mizoram-border-101630056210565.html

State minister TS Singh Deo on Thursday fuelled the speculation about the change saying anyone who plays in a team “wants to be the captain” even as at least 20 legislators backing Baghel flew to New Delhi late on Thursday in a show of defiance.Baghel and Deo met Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, PL Punia, the in-charge of Chhattisgarh, and general secretary (organisation) K C Venugopal on Tuesday to thrash out a solution to the impasse in the state. The impasse has been caused by a power-sharing agreement put in place when Congress formed the government in the state in December 2018.Baghel said Venugopal sent him a message on Thursday that the former has to meet Rahul Gandhi. “As per his direction, I am going there and I do not have more information,” Baghel told reporters before flying to Delhi. “Why cannot they go to meet their leaders. I got a call therefore I am going, and they were going uninvited. Due to the pandemic, nobody could have visited Delhi for a long time and now they have gone to meet leaders,” he said when asked about lawmakers and ministers camping in New Delhi. Baghel refused to comment on Deo’s captain remarks.Also Read | Chhattisgarh HC order: ‘Sexual act with wife is not rape, even if forced’State ministers Ravindra Chaubey and Mohammad Akbar were also seen entering the Raipur airport before Baghel flew to Delhi.

He added there is rivalry even among siblings, and that he would “carry out the responsibility that has been given to him”.In December 2018, when Congress returned to power in the state with 68 of 90 seats in the assembly, Baghel, state minister Tamradhwaj Sahu, speaker Charan Das Mahant and Deo were seen as the contenders to the chief ministerial post.Baghel has since Tuesday met at least a dozen legislators and other functionaries close to him. He said on Tuesday that “those propagating the two-and-a-half-year power-sharing formula were trying to bring political instability and would never succeed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baghel-back-in-delhi-for-more-meetings-amid-signs-of-possible-change-in-guard-101630052428179.html

27-08-2021||India||Tiger buffer zones earn MP revenue; concerns remain over impact on conservation||The opening of buffer zones of six tiger reserves in Madhya Pradesh for tourists this monsoon has earned the state ₹26 lakh revenue even as there have been concerns about the impact of the move on conservation. Tiger habitats are closed in the rainy season. The move to open their buffer zones for tourism has drawn flak with wildlife experts saying revenue is being preferred over conservation.The zones with over 80 tigers were opened for tourism for the first time in the monsoon under the “buffer main safar (travel in buffer)” programme. Officials said the highest revenue of ₹12 lakh each was collected from Bandhavgarh and Kanha tiger reserves. The Bandhavgarh reserve is one of the most congested in India with 124 tigers including at least 45 in its buffer zone. Kanha has 108 tigers. They include 25 in its buffer zone. According to the 2018 tiger census, there were 526 tigers in Madhya Pradesh.Also Read | MP govt contemplating to reopen schools for Classes 6 to 8 from next monthPrincipal chief conservator of forests Alok Kumar insisted they were following all the guidelines and regulations to protect the tiger. “If reserve officials receive any information about the movement of tigers (in an area)...we do not allow the tourists there.” Kumar added the zones were opened following discussions with experts and conservationists.Wildlife Institute of India (Dehradun)’s senior tiger ecologist, YV Jhala, said there is no problem with the concept if it is being done in a regulated manner. “There is no fixed time of mating of tigers, and it was proved in many studies. The forest department should do this with a dynamic plan by giving priority to conservation.”Wildlife expert Suhas Kumar said tiger reserves are not set up to promote tourism and earn money. “Their prime objective is conservation by educating people and making them sensitive towards wildlife. The National Wildlife Action Plan, 2017, clearly said that if there is a conflict between tourism and conservation in the wildlife area, conservation should prevail.”Conservationist Ajay Dubey the concept makes tourism the prime objective. “In 2016, NTCA (National Tiger Conservation Authority) issued guidelines with a provision for a ban on the movement of tourists during monsoon for rejuvenation and favourable and peaceful environment for wild animals... but this has been diluted.” Dubey said buffers zones are nothing but supplementary areas for the free movement of tigers from overcrowded core areas. “The forest department has overlooked everything to generate revenue.”Vinay Varman, a former eco-tourism board managing director, said most of the tigers are killed in buffer zones in the absence of patrolling. “...tourist movement (there) can help forest officials in keeping an eye on tigers and in stopping free movement of poachers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tiger-buffer-zones-earn-mp-revenue-concerns-remain-over-impact-on-conservation-101630050147996.html

27-08-2021||India||Militants gun down 5 in Assam, set trucks afire||Guwahati Five persons were killed and one injured after suspected militants belonging to the Dimasa National Liberation Army (DNLA) fired indiscriminately at seven trucks and set them ablaze in Assam’s Dima Hasao district, police said on Friday.The trucks, loaded with cement, coal and other materials, were on their way to a cement factory at Umrangso when they were stopped at Diyungbra at around 8.30 pm on Thursday and attacked by the group.A cement factory’s refusal to yield to the DNLA’s extortion demands recently may have probably triggered the attack, police said.“The group fired at the vehicles for several minutes and then set them afire. Five persons were killed and one sustained injury. All of them are drivers and handymen of the trucks,” Dima Hasao superintendent of police Jayant Singh said. “Additional forces were rushed to the spot immediately after the incident and a combing operation is underway to nab the culprits,” he added. The injured person was rushed to the nearest government hospital.Formed in April 2019, the DNLA is an Assam-based insurgent group which seeks an independent nation for the Dimasa community through armed struggle. Dimasa is one of the indigenous tribes of the state. Around 142,413 Dimasas were concentrated in Dima Hasao district, as per the 2011 census, while others lived in neighbouring Nagaland. In recent months, nearly 20 members of the outfit have either surrendered or been killed in gun battles with security forces. DNLA claims to be fighting for protecting the tribe’s culture and language, and restoring the Dimasa kingdom, one of the earliest of the region. Rebel groups such as Dima Halam Daogah and Black Widow were initially operative in the region but gradually turned inactive.Assam has a history of armed groups representing various communities seeking sovereignty, a separate state or an autonomous region. Several of them, like the National Democratic Front of Bodoland and United Liberation Front of Asom (pro-talks faction), have given up the armed struggle and signed peace deals with the Centre.On May 14, two persons were killed in a grenade blast at Digboi in Tinsukia district, allegedly carried out by the United Liberation Front of Asom (Independent).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-killed-1-injured-as-suspected-militants-attacks-trucks-in-assam-district-101630034607050.html

27-08-2021||India||Chhattisgarh Congress on the line? As Baghel visits Delhi today, here's what we know so far||Amid rumours of a growing rift in the Chattisgarh Congress unit, the state's chief minister Bhupesh Baghel is set to visit the national capital for the second time this week on Friday, August 27, for a meeting with the party's senior leadership in Delhi. It was only on Tuesday that Baghel had travelled to Delhi to meet Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who also talked to state health minister TS Singh Deo in a bid to resolve a power tussle between the two senior leaders of the Chhattisgarh unit. There has been considerable speculation over a possible change in guard in the state, even as people familiar with internal party matters told news agencies that Baghel has rejected talks about a rotation of the chief minister's post.Also Read | Buzz over Chhattisgarh change of guard growsHowever, it is not just Bhupesh Baghel who is looking to consolidate support with the Congress high command in Delhi; in a show of strength, at least 20 legislators backing Baghel also flew to the national capital late on Thursday night. According to a report by the PTI news agency, several party MLAs who are close to Baghel left for Delhi, while two state ministers and some legislators are already camping in the national capital.The meeting on Tuesday seems to have been called to thrash out a solution to the impasse in Chhattisgarh, caused by a power-sharing agreement put in place when the government was formed in December 2018. However, PL Punia, in charge of the state's Congress unit, said that the talks among Baghel, Deo, and Gandhi centred around developmental issues and not leadership change. He also told reporters that the senior Congress leaders had not "summoned" any of the state's lawmakers to the national capital.According to senior leaders close to Chhattisgarh chief minister Baghel, the fresh set of meeting with the party leadership on Friday would bring up “many things still not discussed.”After meeting the former Congress president, Baghel had said that those who are talking about "two and a half years' (power-sharing formula) are trying to bring political instability and they will never succeed."Meanwhile, Singh Deo, who has remained in Delhi since the meetings on Tuesday, said, “If a person plays in a team, then doesn’t he think of becoming the captain? Everyone thinks about that but the question is not about thoughts, it’s about capabilities. The high command takes a decision.” Leaders close to the health minister said that they were staying in Delhi to avoid a situation of competing shows of strength in Raipur, and hoped for a quick declaration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-congress-on-the-line-as-baghel-visits-delhi-today-here-s-what-we-know-so-far-101630025772030.html
27-08-2021||India||Krishna River Management Board to meet today to discuss flow of funds, water allocation||The Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) will on Friday discuss among other issues budgetary support and the working arrangement for sharing of waters of the Krishna during the 2021-22 water year during its full board meeting. One of the agendas of the meeting, over the ongoing tussle between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in regard to the utilisation of Krishna water, is also to shift the KRMB headquarters from Hyderabad to Visakhapatnam.According to a notice by KRMB member-secretary DM Raipure, providing budgetary support to the board is one of the critical issues that will come up for discussion at the meeting to be also attended by water resources officials of the two states.During its third meeting, the KRMB proposed to create a reserve fund of ₹10 crore but so far both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have not contributed any amount. Though a budget of ₹18 crore has been approved for the 2021-22 financial years, the two states have not released any money so far. "Even after repeated correspondence with both the states, the KRMB did not receive requisite funds. The Board now has a bank balance of only ₹2.46 crore,” Raipure said.The KRMB has requested the two states to release ₹10 crore each immediately to meet its expenditure. The Telangana government released ₹3.5 crore last year against its allocated amount of ₹8.37 crore. "No funds were received from the Andhra Pradesh government in the last two years," Raipure added.According to the notice, the agenda of the meeting would also be to discuss the working arrangement for sharing of Krishna water during 2021-22 water year as Telangana requested an emergency sharing ratio of 50:50 against the agreed 66:34.Raipure further stated that Telangana's request for allowing it to carry over the unutilized share of water to the next year and Andhra Pradesh’s objection to it would also be discussed in the meeting.The meeting would also discuss the Andhra Pradesh government’s complaint against the construction of several micro-irrigation projects in Telangana and the utilization of 175.54 tmc feet (one thousand million cubic feet) of water against the allotted share of 89.15 tmc ft. The KRMB would also focus on Telangana’s demand for an additional share of 45 tmc ft of Krishna water since Andhra Pradesh was diverting Godavari water to the Krishna basin and the two states’ tussle over hydel power generation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/krishna-river-management-board-to-meet-today-to-discuss-flow-of-funds-water-allocation-101630020925123.html

This will be her first visit to Tripura since the alliance of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT) came to power in the state in March 2018. During her visit this time, Sitharaman is also expected to conduct meetings with the state government officials, according to people at the chief minister's office (CMO) familiar with the matter.Nirmala Sitharaman may also hold a meeting with Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb during her visit, according to an unnamed functionary of the chief minister's office cited by news agency PTI. She is also likely to hold a meeting with top state government officials later in the day to discuss in detail various issues related to the state's progress and development, the official added.Sitharaman, on the first day of her visit on Friday, is slated to inaugurate as many as 11 developmental projects which are worth ₹151 crore in total. Later in the day, she will also be paying a visit to a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccination centre at Gandhigram near Tripura's capital Agartala, as per updates provided by the functionary.On the second day of her visit on Saturday, the Union finance minister will travel to Udaipur (formerly known as Rangamati), the third-largest city in Tripura, to offer her prayers at the famous Tripura Sundari temple there. Notably, the temple is considered to be one of the 51 'Shakti Peethas', significant Hindu shrines and pilgrimage destinations scattered across India.Sitharaman, after offering her prayers at the temple, is scheduled to hold meetings with the members of a local self-help group in the district. Thereafter, she will fly back to Delhi during the second half of Saturday, the CMO official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirmala-sitharaman-on-2-day-tripura-visit-from-today-set-to-launch-slew-of-projects-101630021121958.html
27-08-2021||India||‘Huge amount of investment needed to meet 1.5 degree goal’: Ajay Mathur||India is inching closer to achieving one of its goals under the Paris Agreement that of having 40% of its electric power from renewable sources by 2030, Ajay Mathur, director general of International Solar Alliance tells HT’s Jayashree Nandi in an interview. He said India will possibly do more than that with major boost in development of battery storage facilities in the next few years but coal power will continue to be a large source of electricity generation till 2040s and that the 1.5 degree goal may be impossible without carbon capture and storage facilities or extremely large investments in clean technologies globally. Edited excerpts:How far are we from achieving one of our targets under the Paris Agreement of having 40% of electricity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030?Today we are at 33-34% that’s pretty close to 40%. However, one of the things that I would like to stress is that India’s internal targets of achieving 100 GW of solar and 60 GW of wind by 2022 and then the 450 GW by 2030 will take us way beyond the 40% target. It’s quite possible that in 2040 not just 40% of capacity but 40% of energy generation will come from renewable energy sources.What are the challenges in achieving our renewable energy targets?There is a challenge. We will achieve our 40% target there is no question about it. But if we want to keep growing the challenge is the price of electricity from renewable energy round the clock has to be less than fossil fuel energy. Solar is available round the day when the sun is shining but the largest demand for electricity occurs in the evening... What is important is that cost effective storage is available well before 2030... this will happen between 2022 and 2025. Because Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) had put out tenders for round-the-clock electricity from renewable energy... This is not to say that fossil fuel-based electricity will come to zero but the additional electricity will come from renewables plus batteries.How much of our electricity capacity is from solar and what is the growth trajectory like?In 2015, when we pledged our goals before the UN Paris Conference, less than 5% of the electricity was from solar and wind combined. Today, solar alone is around 11% and in the years to come solar plus wind plus large hydro plus nuclear will be 40% if we are able to meet the cost curve...We are expecting a doubling of 11% from solar to 22 to 24% in 2030.Many countries are pledging a net zero emissions goal by mid-century. Is that a feasible goal and are there foolproof intermediate plans to achieve it?We need to be sure that technologies are available for zero CO2 in all sectors not just power... So, the question is will we have cost effective technologies by 2030? That is the only way you can be net zero by 2050...A large number of resources will have to be invested by every country to enable net zero to occur. Net zero goal is based on two assumptions: that we have technologies and they are cost effective and second, that countries are politically willing to put in resources that are needed to offset the emissions that occur even at that time...Despite our progress in renewable energy, coal mines are being auctioned, thermal plants continue to supply a major chunk of electricity and PM Modi during his Independence Day speech said India will be a large gas based economy? Why so? Will coal continue to be a major energy source for us?Coal will continue to be a major source of electricity for the next ten years, may be even longer... I think the goal of the auctions is to replace coal that is imported and replaced by coal produced in India. In the net, there will be no increase in the amount of coal used in India. Already we have had four years when no new financial approvals for new coal capacity have occurred. Coal will however continue to be a major energy source possibly into the 2040s because we have existing coal mines and coal plants which will still be competitive and the total electricity we get from solar and solar plus batteries will be limited capacity. Coal demand and production will still be there but beyond 2027-2028 or around that time it will not grow any further.The latest IPCC report seems to suggest the 1.5 degree warming goal is nearly impossible. Is that goal still alive?The 1.5 degree goal is impossible to achieve unless there is very large net extraction of CO2 from the atmosphere. We need very large CO2 sinks like large carbon capture and storage technologies or large afforestation programs only then 1.5 degree is possible. Otherwise realistically speaking, we do not have cost effective technologies and therefore a huge amount of investment will be needed to meet the 1.5 degree goal. I don’t see that kind of political appetite for that kind of investment in almost any country in the world. It had been thought that by 2020 there will be a large number of carbon capture and storage facilities. There are two facilities that are working. Price estimates suggest they cost around 30 to 80 dollars per tonne of CO2 so the technologies are very expensive. The geology for CCS is also very specific. So, it is restrictive.What have been ISA’s achievements in furthering solar energy capacity globally?ISA is about enabling solarisation across the world. Solar will become the energy source of choice if it's easily doable, if it creates jobs and if getting money for doing it is comparatively easier as compared to getting money for doing fossil fuel-based projects. What ISA does is three things--first is looking at how we are able to capture the information on the progress that is happening in solar. We are giving out annual progress reports on solar technologies; solar investments and solar markets. This year, we will do these assessments for 98 countries. The second is if you need to do this you will need people and systems. You need human, institutional and financial capacity. We bring out a number of training programs across the cycle for bankers, policymakers and others. The other point is how do we bring money into it? A vast amount, around 95% of the cost of electricity generated from renewable energy even with storage is based on the capital cost as opposed to fossil fuels where only 50% is based on the capital cost. Clearly, the interest rate at which you borrow money becomes very important. Our focus is how do we create this risk mitigation and readiness. We are starting off by creating a blended finance facility—first it is for Africa and then we will expand it for Asia and Latin America. This is going to be a $700million facility which is going to provide risk finance and readiness capital.Solar rooftop projects haven’t picked up in a big way in Indian cities yet. Why?There are two major issues with solar rooftop projects. Electricity utilities are needed to commit to buying excess solar electricity generated by households and to supplying the electricity when households need it. Households need it at night so distribution companies will have to commit to generating companies that if we had solar roof tops, we would get electricity at night. That when I have excess electricity, they will buy it, which is typically in the afternoon when the company has too much electricity in hand. If it has to buy the electricity that I generate at the price at which it sells electricity, then it’s incurring a loss. So, distribution utilities have been extremely hesitant in providing full support to net metering facilities. Second problem relates to physical infrastructure. Bidirectional meters needed but they are still limited. Transformers also have to enable distribution. It will take time to develop physical infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/huge-amount-of-investment-needed-to-meet-1-5-degree-goal-101630023026338.html
27-08-2021||India||Minister blames survivor, says Oppn trying to ‘rape’ him||A political row pertaining to the Mysuru gangrape erupted on Thursday after Karnataka home minister Araga Jnanendra questioned the timing of the survivor’s visit to a deserted spot and alleged that the Congress was trying to “rape” him by targeting him in the case.While addressing reporters here, Jnanendra, a first-time minister who was inducted into the Basavaraj Bommai cabinet recently, said: “It was a deserted place. First of all, they should not have gone there at night. We cannot stop anyone from going anywhere. People don’t go there as it is deserted, but these two people had gone there. Now, people have blamed the police for not patrolling the area. I will look into these lapses.”Accusing the Congress of trying to “rape” him by trying to gain political mileage out of the case, Jnanendra said: “The rape has taken place there (Mysuru). But Congress is trying to rape me, the home minister, here. They are trying to get political mileage out of this incident. This is an inhuman act. We have to worry about how to prevent such incidents in the future and how our police force must work.”The Congress had criticised the law and order situation in the state after a 22-year-old woman was allegedly raped by five men near Chamundi Hill in Mysuru on Tuesday. The girl and her male friend, who was assaulted by the gang, are undergoing treatment in a private hospital.Chief minister Basavaraj S Bommai disapproved of the home minister’s remarks and said he had sought a clarification in this regard. “I just don’t agree with the comments made by my home minister regarding the gang-rape incident. I have advised him to give clarification,” he told reporters.Condemning the home minister’s remarks, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president DK Shivakumar urged the police to arrest his partymen involved in “raping the home minister”. “The Home Minister has taken the word ‘rape’ very lightly. He claims the Congressmen are trying to rape the home minister of the state and I demand the DGP file an FIR under section 376 of the Indian Penal Code against all the Congressmen who are trying to rape and immediately arrest them,” Shivakumar said.Later, a statement from Jnanendra’s office said he had withdrawn the remarks against the Congress leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/minister-blames-survivor-says-oppn-trying-to-rape-him-101630022770844.html

27-08-2021||India||Centre clears names of nine judges for SC||The decks have been cleared for India to get its first woman Chief Justice of India (CJI) in 2027. The Union government on Thursday notified the appointment of nine new judges to the Supreme Court, including justice BV Nagarathna, who will be in line to take over as the first women CJI in September 2027 for a tenure of a little over a month.Apart from justice Nagarathna, two more women judges are among the nine appointed to the top court. This is the largest number of judges appointed in the Supreme Court at one go.On August 18, HT reported that collegium cleared nine names for appointments in the apex court. HT first reported on February 21 that justice Nagarathna was among those in contention to be elevated, and that she could go on to become the country’s first woman CJI.The Supreme Court, which has a sanctioned strength of 34 judges, currently has only one woman judge, justice Indira Banerjee, who is set to retire in September 2022. The Supreme Court collegium’s latest push for appointment of three women judges can be seen as an important step in bridging the gender gap in an institution which has seen only eight women judges in the last 71 years.Justice Nagarathna, elevated from the Karnataka high court, is the daughter of former CJI Engalaguppe Seetharamiah Venkataramiah, who was in the top office for six months in 1989. This will be only the second instance of two generations of a family heading the judiciary. Justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud is in the line to become the CJI in November 2022, while his father, justice YV Chandrachud, was the CJI between 1978 and 1985.The other names cleared by the government are justices Abhay Shreeniwas Oka (chief justice of Karnataka HC), Vikram Nath (chief justice of Gujarat HC), Jitendra Kumar Maheshwari (chief justice of Sikkim HC), Hima Kohli (chief justice of Telangana HC), CT Ravikumar (judge in Kerala HC), MM Sundresh (judge in Madras HC) and PS Narasimha (senior advocate and former additional solicitor general).According to people familiar with the development, the new judges will take the oath of office on August 31.Of the nine judges, justices Nath and Narasimha will also be in line to become the CJI. As per the top court’s seniority norms, justice Nath will succeed justice Surya Kant as the CJI for seven months between February and September 2027; justice Narasimha will have a tenure of more than a year after justice Nagarathna demits office in October 2027.Narasimha is the ninth lawyer ever to be appointed directly from the bar. The recommendation for the senior lawyer came less than a week after the retirement of justice Rohinton F Nariman, who was only the fifth lawyer to be directly appointed from the bar. Narasimha will also be only the third lawyer to become the CJI.After the new judges are sworn in, the top court will be short of only one judge out of its total strength. Justice Navin Sinha retired on August 18, a day after the collegium finalised nine names for as many vacancies existing at the point of time.The collegium in the Supreme Court comprises CJI NV Ramana, and justices Uday U Lalit, AM Khanwilkar, Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao.It was the first collegium meeting in the last 21 months in which the five most senior judges could arrive at a consensus in forwarding names to the Union government for appointments in the top court.Since the retirement of justice Ranjan Gogoi as the CJI in November 2019, the collegium had not sent a single recommendation for appointments in the top court.As reported by HT on February 21, the impasse in the collegium, according to the people familiar with the development, persisted due to justice Nariman’s insistence on recommending justice Akil A Kureshi, currently chief justice of the Tripura high court, as a judge in the apex court.Justice Nariman had asserted that any recommendation to be made by the collegium of the five most senior judges must include justice Kureshi, who stood at number 2 in all-India seniority list of high court judges. A lack of consensus within the collegium stalled appointment of judges in the top court starting November 2019.The previous CJI SA Bobde’s 17-month tenure turned out to be the only one in Indian judicial history when a CJI demitted office without making any recommendation for the Supreme Court after the advent of the collegium system in 1990s.Both justices Bobde and Nariman, however, said at different platforms that it is time for the country to have its first woman CJI – an aspiration which will is likely to turn into reality in six years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-clears-names-of-nine-judges-for-sc-101630016773219.html
27-08-2021||India||The southern factor in India’s Covid numbers||India faced a brutal second wave of Covid-19 infections starting February that ran through the country till May. When this wave peaked on May 9, daily new cases fell sharply almost throughout India. However, in recent weeks, a growing outbreak in Kerala -- apparently sparked by Onam festivities -- has again started dominating headlines.On Wednesday, the state reported 31,445 new infections, making it responsible for more than two-thirds of all new cases reported across India on the day. The state’s tally on Wednesday was also the most infections lodged in any state in India in a single day since May 27, when Tamil Nadu recorded 33,361 new cases.It is a given that Kerala, of course, is the region reporting the highest number of new cases. But if we look at big states seeing high number of cases with respect to their population, we see others on the list are largely located in southern India. After Kerala (561 cases per million in the past week) on the list lie Maharashtra (37 cases per million), followed by Andhra Pradesh (25), Tamil Nadu (22), Odisha (20), Karnataka (20), and Telangana (9).Here are five charts that try to how the post-second wave battle against the disease has weighed heavily on southern India and Maharashtra.A minor rise in new cases and deaths visible across India againThe seven-day average of daily new cases in India has risen from a 156-day low of 24 infections per million for the week ending Sunday to 25.3 for the week ending Wednesday. While this may only be a 5% increase, and is heavily influenced by numbers from Kerala, it remains a cause of concern. In the same period, the seven-day average of reported deaths across the country (per million population) has seen an increase of 10%.And while the death trajectory has seen sudden spurts since June due to states such as Maharashtra and Bihar adding deaths to their tallies that had earlier gone unreported (see chart), the recent spurt is not due to any major death toll reconciliation.All figures used in this analysis have been normalised using the region’s population as it provides a common comparison point for areas vastly different in size and population.Kerala contributing 58% of all new cases in IndiaMore than 58% of all new infections reported across the country in the past week can be traced back to just Kerala – a statistic that underscores how large an outlier the state is to the overall trend.With population factored in, Kerala has reported 561 new cases per million in the past week against a national average of around 25. But when Kerala’s numbers are removed from the national tally, the latter sees a massive drop – there have been an average of around 11 new infections per million every day in the past week in the rest of India. Another way to look at these numbers is that, per capita, Kerala is currently reporting 52 times as many new cases in the past week as the rest of the country.But Kerala’s share of Covid-19 deaths is still not as badWhen the same calculations are applied to the number of deaths reported due to Covid-19 in the past week, Kerala’s numbers (though still high) see a marginal improvement. The state has been responsible for 35% of all deaths reported across India in the past week – a much lower share than its caseload.With population factored in, the state has seen 3.8 deaths per million residents against a national average of around 0.4 fatalities per million. Even removing Kerala’s numbers from the national tally to derive the “Rest of India” number doesn’t improve the national figure by much – it only drops to 0.3 deaths per million. To be sure, it still implies that Kerala is currently reporting 14 times as many deaths due to Covid as the rest of the country.This is not surprising as Kerala, despite its recent surge in infections, remains the region with one of the best case fatality rate (CFR) in the country – 0.5% against a national average of 1.3%.Six regions seeing 16 times as many cases than the restWhen the numbers from Maharashtra and five states from south India – Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Kerala and Karnataka – are taken together, we see that average new cases per million residents in these regions have grown 7% (from 76.8 to 81.9) in the past four days (against a national average of a 5% increase, as stated above).Together, these six states have reported 16 times as many cases as the rest of India (excluding these regions), where there have been just 5 new cases per million residents every day in the past week. Importantly, numbers in the rest of the country have not been rising as drastically in the past few days as much as they have been in the rest of the country (as can be seen in the chart here)....with a slightly better performance in saving livesThe death trend in these six regions again presents a slightly better grasp of how they have managed to keep fatalities relatively low. Despite having reported 16 times as many cases as the rest of India in the past week, these states have seen 9 times as many fatalities as the rest of the country – on average, these six states have seen 1 death per million residents, against 0.1 fatalities per million in the rest of the country.A fact worthy of note here is that these regions are only getting better. On June 1, these regions were seeing an average of 5.9 fatalities every day for every million residents – 4.6 more than the rest of the country at the time (where there were 1.3 deaths per million). This gap has almost steadily improved and has now been reduced to 0.9 deaths per million in the past week.ht||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-southern-factor-in-india-s-covid-numbers-101630014756264.html
27-08-2021||India||Army’s lightning takeover gave India heft in LAC talks||The Indian Army’s lightning takeover of strategic heights on the southern side of Pangong Tso a year ago stunned the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA), gave it (the Indian Army) heft in subsequent military negotiations, and eventually paved the way for the first and crucial round of disengagement of rival soldiers and weaponry from the Pangong Tso sector in eastern Ladakh, officials and experts tracking the developments said on Thursday.The bold moves on the Kailash range and other heights on the southern bank at midnight on August 29 were “a game changer and tilted the balance in favour of the Indian Army” for the first time almost four months after the border row erupted in early May 2020, a senior army officer -- one of the people cited above -- said on condition of anonymity.The PLA wasn’t expecting the Indian Army to take control of the southern heights when the entire focus was on developments on the northern bank where the Chinese had intruded into Indian territory and grabbed positions on Finger 4 overlooking Indian deployments, said a second official, who asked not to be named.“The five rounds of talks held before the August 29 action last year were focused on the Finger Area and other friction points where the PLA had unilaterally changed status quo. And then suddenly, the heights on the southern side of Pangong Tso were also on the negotiating table. It boosted our bargaining power,” this person added.The Indian Army occupied a series of strategic heights to prevent the PLA from grabbing Indian territory on the southern bank of Pangong Tso in a stealthy midnight move on August 29, 2020. In swift follow-up action that threw the PLA off balance, the Indian Army rushed its front-line tanks and infantry combat vehicles (ICVs) to the new heights held by its soldiers.The aggressive move sent a clear message to China that India had the military capability and resolve to change the status quo on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in its favour, said former director general of military operations Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd).“In the ensuing military talks, the Indian Army was negotiating the restoration of status quo ante (of April 2020) on the LAC from a position of relative strength.”The Indian Army ‘s control of ridgeline positions on the southern bank allowed it to completely dominate the sector and keep an eye on Chinese military activity, with the previously-held Indian positions scattered across Rezang La, Reqin pass, Gurung Hill and Magar heights.The Indian Army put further pressure on the PLA in early September 2020 with its soldiers taking control of key heights overlooking the PLA’s deployments on the Finger 4 ridgeline on the northern bank. Rival soldiers were then holding ground barely a few hundred metres from each other on the Finger 4 heights.Disengagement of rival troops and weaponry from the Pangong Tso sector took place more than five months later after the ninth round of military talks. “The developments on the southern bank last August hastened the disengagement process. Things were stuck before that,” said a third official.India and China wrapped up the disengagement process in Pangong Tso area in mid-February, with their armies pulling back forward-deployed troops, tanks, ICVs and artillery guns from strategic heights where rival soldiers last year fired shots for the first time at the LAC after 45 years. (The last recorded incident when bullets were fired at the LAC was in October 1975, when the PLA ambushed an Indian patrol in Arunachal Pradesh’s Tulung La sector and shot four soldiers dead.)The situation on both banks of Pangong Tso was extremely tense before the disengagement took place, with Northern Army commander Lieutenant General YK Joshi admitting in February 2021 that India and China were on the brink of war after the actions on the southern bank.Apart from the demolition of military structures erected by both sides after April 2020, the disengagement also saw both armies pull back troops deployed eyeball-to-eyeball on the Finger 4 ridgeline at heights of almost 18,000 feet.The second round of disengagement took place in early August when the two armies pulled back their forward deployed troops from Gogra or Patrol Point-17A, which was one of the friction points on the LAC, with the breakthrough coming after the 12th round of military talks.The disengagement was carried out on August 4-5, almost six months after the two armies pulled back their troops and weaponry from the Pangong Tso sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armys-lightning-takeover-gave-india-heft-in-lac-talks-101630009386008.html
27-08-2021||India||Restoration work of 2 prominent Mughal Gardens begins in Kashmir||The restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s two most prominent Mughal Gardens – Nishat Bagh and Shalimar Bagh – has started a month after the government signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the JSW Foundation for conservation of the UT’s heritage places.Conservation architect, Abha Narain Lambah, who is working with JSW Foundation, gave a detailed briefing to Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on Wednesday on the work being undertaken by the team for preservation and restoration of Shalimar and Nishat gardens.“The Lt Governor impressed upon the conservation architect to conduct the work of conservation, restoration, and preservation meticulously for restoring the original beauty and grandeur of the famous heritage gardens,” a spokesperson of the government said.Shalimar Bagh is the largest Mughal garden in Kashmir built by Emperor Jahangir for his wife Noor Jahan in 1619, on the banks of Dal Lake in northeast Srinagar. Built in 1633 by Asif Khan, the picturesquely terraced Nishat Bagh is also a Mughal garden situated close to the Shalimar on the eastern side of the Dal Lake. The Zabarwan Mountains form the background of the garden. In March 2020, Lambah, who runs an architectural conservation firm, was also appointed by J&K government to prepare a dossier to enlist prominent tourists’ spots of Kashmir like Mughal Gardens on the UNESCO World Heritage sites. Lambah’s firm has won 9 UNESCO Asia Pacific Awards for conservation projects.On July 28, the J&K Government inked a MoU with JSW Foundation, which is a social arm of multinational conglomerate JSW Group, for restoration & conservation of the gardens to restore the glory of these heritage places.The JSW Foundation is supporting the government of J&K, both financially and technically in preserving the two heritage gardens under corporate social responsibility (CSR), the government spokesperson had said.After the MoU, the J&K LG had said that was giving much-needed impetus to integrate the promotion of cultural heritage in UT’s development plan in order to connect the people from across the world with the glorious history of J&K.With its technical expertise, the support of the JSW foundation is expected to provide a “determined push” to the conservation work of the heritage gardens.The project for restoration and conservation of Shalimar and Nishat gardens is being monitored by the project monitoring committee, headed by the Commissioner Secretary to Government, Department of Floriculture Gardens and Parks.The project is being taken up in two phases. The estimated cost of the conservation and restoration project of Nishat Bagh is ₹7 crore while a similar project is envisaged for Shalimar Bagh also.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/restoration-work-of-2-prominent-mughal-gardens-begins-in-kashmir-101630008984140.html
27-08-2021||India||India condemns Kabul airport attack||India on Thursday condemned the terrorist attack near a gate of the Kabul airport that targeted crowds of people hoping to get on flights out of Afghanistan, saying the world needs to stand united against terror. Russian officials said at least 13 people were killed and 15 more injured, though reports coming in from Kabul indicated the death toll could be as high as 60. US media reports said up to 10 American military personnel were among the dead. Videos and images that emerged after the attack showed dozens of people lying prone outside the perimeter wall of the airport, currently the only way out of Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover on August 15. “India strongly condemns the bomb blasts in Kabul today. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims of this terrorist attack. Our thoughts and prayers also go out to the injured,” the external affairs ministry said in a brief statement. The “attacks reinforce the need for the world to stand unitedly against terrorism and all those who provide sanctuaries to terrorists”, the statement added in an apparent reference to the safe havens enjoyed by the Taliban and other terror groups in Pakistan. A group of suicide attackers targeted the eastern gate of Kabul airport amid a massive and chaotic evacuation effort from Afghanistan, raising serious questions about the security of flights by countries such as the US and India. The attackers, including two suicide bombers, launched their assault at a gate where crowds of Afghans had gathered to get into the airport. There was no claim of responsibility for the attack. Reuters cited a source familiar with US congressional briefings as saying that American officials strongly believe the Afghan affiliate of Islamic State, known as Islamic State-Khorasan, was responsible. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby tweeted that an explosion at Abbey gate of Kabul airport was the “result of a complex attack that resulted in a number of US & civilian casualties”. He also confirmed another explosion “at or near the Baron Hotel”, located a short distance from Abbey gate. Abbey gate was the entrance used by American citizens for evacuation flights. Baron Hotel, located about 300 meters from the site of the first explosion, was being used by British troops as a base for evacuating UK citizens. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said in a tweet in Pashto that the attack occurred in an area where US forces were responsible for security. “The [Taliban] strongly condemns the bombing of civilians at Kabul airport, which took place in an area where US forces are responsible for security. The [Taliban] is paying close attention to the security and protection of its people, and evil circles will be strictly stopped,”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-condemns-kabul-airport-attack-101630004783854.html
27-08-2021||India||TN to set up control room to receive complaints of sexual abuse in schools||Chennai: In a bid to bolster safety of school students, Tamil Nadu on Thursday announced setting up of a control room with a toll-free number and a private email facility to receive complaints on sexual abuse. An orientation module will also be prepared to raise awareness about Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act among all stakeholders. The announcements were part of the policy note tabled by school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi in the ongoing assembly session. The development comes in the wake of several teachers from prestigious schools being investigated on charges of sexually abusing children during online classes as well as in classrooms and sports fields. A few weeks after the DMK government took over, alumni and students of top schools in Chennai began sharing their bitter experiences with teachers and coaches on social media that snowballed into several complaints across the state. Police have also made a few swift arrests in the cases. Subsequently, the government issued guidelines on online classes as well as institutions to protect students from sexual abuse. Poyyamozhi on Thursday said that Child Abuse Prevention Week should be observed in all the schools every year from November 15-22 and a Student Safety Advisory Committee will also be set up in each school to monitor their safety. The control room will be set up at the Directorate of Public Instructions (DPI) campus in Chennai to receive complaints, specifically pertaining to sexual abuse and violence at schools from students, parents and others. “An orientation module will be also prepared for use by schools to raise awareness about the POCSO Act among all stakeholders and to boost safety in schools,” the minister said in the policy note. Among other measures are installation of safety boxes in school premises to enable students to lodge their complaints and feedback. Another helpline is functioning round-the clock- in the DPI campus to provide information, guidance to students and offer counselling. “This is a single point of contact for students, teachers and parents across the state to get their grievances redressed. So far, around 3.5 lakh calls have been received on this helpline,” said Poyyamozhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-to-set-up-control-room-to-receive-complaints-of-sexual-abuse-in-schools-101630004304204.html

The BBMP has justified its action by stating that the government has allowed commercial establishments to operate with a condition that all Covid appropriate protocols will be followed.The circular comes at a time when the Basavaraj Bommai government has turned a blind eye on political events, gatherings of its own party and administration but threatened strict measures against the public for any violations of Covid-19 norms.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Jana Ashirwad Yatra continues to be undertaken with hundreds of people attending them with no semblance of Covid appropriate behaviour like wearing masks, maintaining physical distancing or any other precautions to prevent another outbreak.“As a measure to contain the transmission of virus and prevent any further surge of Covid-19 cases in the city, it is essential to ensure that staff of commercial establishments/industries/hotels & restaurants/offices do not get infected and thereafter spread the infection to customers & public visiting such places,” the BBMP circular stated. The BBMP also said that it was the duty of the employers of such establishments to ensure regular testing of their staff and ensure 100% vaccination. “At least one dose of vaccination shall be complied with for employers by August 31,” the circular added.Karnataka has so far administered 3,84,67,795 doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the state, according to data from CoWin portal as on 9.40 pm on Thursday.This includes 2,93,06,361 first doses and 91,61,434 second doses.Bommai, who is on a two-day visit to Delhi, on Thursday said that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led union government has agreed to increase the quota of doses that will be distributed to the state in the coming months.“They (union government) have said that they will give us more vaccines in September and October,” Bommai said in Delhi on Thursday.The Karnataka government is hoping to administer at least the first dose of the vaccine to all eligible population by the end of the year and has planned to take its daily count up to 500,000 per day to achieve this goal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/follow-covid-norms-strictly-civic-body-to-business-establishments-101630004124622.html
27-08-2021||India||Karnataka minister BC Nagesh interview: Resuming schools right move, attendance improving||Karnataka was one of the first states to resume classes for Classes 9 and 10 during the pandemic. While the attendance in schools during the initial days has been low, newly appointed primary and secondary education minister BC Nagesh said that the numbers are increasing, and the government will take a call on reopening other classes on August 30. In an interview with Arun Dev, he also elaborated on the state’s plans to implement the national education policy. Schools in Karnataka reopened on Monday, but 21.08% attendance was reported for Class 10 and 19.5% for Class 9. Do you think parents don’t agree with the government on the decision to reopen schools? These numbers are good and in fact, they are increasing. Some districts have reported more than 50%. Even before the pandemic, the number of students returning after holidays is often low. This time, we think it will take about a week or two for the attendance to normalise since people have gone out of the cities and towns during the pandemic. We expect the numbers to pick up soon. The decision to reopen schools was the right thing to do because online education had several issues like lack of connectivity or access to devices. Even the surveys said around 40% of students were not getting access to education, so it was important to restart schools. What is the status of vaccinating the teaching and non-teaching staff at the schools? In all the districts we have achieved over 85% vaccination and 100% in some. This will be completed at the earliest. When will the schools reopen in the five districts where they are shut, considering that at least three have reported less than 2% positivity rate, which was the criteria for reopening schools? A review was held on the matter. The decision to reopen schools has been left to the deputy commissioners, who will decide based on the situation in those districts. When will the other classes resume? We will take a call on that on (August) 30. As said earlier, close to 40% of the students had difficulties in accessing online education. What steps are being taken to address this? To address this issue, we have asked all schools to conduct bridge courses, which would be a revision of the lessons imparted in online classes. Karnataka is one of the first states to implement the National Education Policy. How will it change the education system and how does the government plan to roll out this policy? We have seen reforms in the education policy in 1968 and 1986. The challenges, such as not having enough schools or not enough people getting education, of that time were addressed by then governments in those policies. Now, we have reached a point where many educationists are of the opinion that the current system of education is putting a lot of burden on the students. So, in the new system we are implementing, we don’t want to have examinations and ensure that children learn while playing. We want to develop that scientific temperament in them. Instead of teaching them in classrooms, we want them to learn from experiments. On the implementation aspect, we want to induct the first batch of students under the new NEP by 2022. There have been demands in the past, especially from the BJP, to change the history lessons in the syllabus regarding the rulers like Tipu Sultan and Mughals. Do you have any such plans? The history we are learning now is written by the British. For generations, we have been taught about the British conquests and our failures. Our history books said British united India, but if you look at it not politically, we were united culturally, maybe through the family system or other practices. That being said, there is no plan at present to change the syllabus. The previous education minister had tried to bring a solution to a tussle between schools and parents over the fees. What is your approach to the problem? We are attending to every complaint (on fee issues) that’s coming to us. The previous minister had proposed a fee formula, which was challenged in the court and the decision has been stayed. At present, we can’t do much since it is sub judice. But, whenever a complaint comes to us, we try to address the issue in the best way we can. But, we are very clear that no one should have to discontinue education because they couldn’t afford the fees. There has been a debate over whether Kannada or English should be the medium of education, with many arguing that education in English is important for a student’s future. What is your position on the issue? I believe a child would be able to grasp better in the language he or she is comfortable, which is their mother tongue. Learning in Kannada doesn’t mean that they would not have knowledge of English. That’s not correct.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-minister-bc-nagesh-interview-resuming-schools-right-move-attendance-improving-101630004004851.html
27-08-2021||India||After 22 residents test positive for Covid-19, BMC seals St Joseph’s boarding school||After 16 children and six adults from St Joseph’s boarding school and orphanage in Agripada in Mumbai Central tested positive for Covid-19, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday sealed the residential school. A total of 95 people from this boarding school and orphanage were tested for the viral infection as part of a fever camp organised by the BMC. Among the 22 people who tested positive for the infection, four children are below 12 years of age, and have been shifted to the paediatrics unit at Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central for treatment. Twelve other children among the 22 who tested positive for Covid-19, are between the age group of 12 years and 18 years, and have been shifted to the Richardson and Cruddas Jumbo Covid-19 facility at Byculla. There are six adults (above 18 years of age), who have also been shifted to the Richardson and Cruddas facility. BMC had organised a fever camp at St Joseph’s boarding school and orphanage on Tuesday between 10 am and 2 pm. It was organised under the Souter Street health post near Meghraj Sethi Road in Agripada after two people tested positive at Souter Street dispensary on Monday. As per policy, BMC organises fever camps in areas where they suspect high risk contacts of positive patients are likely to be affected by Covid-19, or in localities where a series of cases have been found in clusters in a short period of time. Earlier this month, Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal directed the BMC administration in all the wards to increase contact tracing by 1:20 from 1:15 (trace upto 20 high risk contacts from one positive case), and also increase the number of Covid-19 tests conducted in the city daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-22-residents-test-positive-for-covid-19-bmc-seals-st-joseph-s-boarding-school-101630003703657.html
27-08-2021||India||Home secretary takes stock of Kerala, Maharashtra Covid situation||New Delhi: Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla on Thursday reviewed the Covid-19 situation in Kerala and Maharashtra, which have seen a spike in the infections in the last couple of days.During the meeting, the overall management of Covid-19 situation in the two states was discussed. Of the 46,164 cases reported in the country in last 24 hours, 31,445 were reported from Kerala while 5,031 cases were reported from Maharashtra.Bhalla, while reviewing the efforts being made by the state governments to contain the spread of infections, said more efforts would be required to arrest the increase in infections, according to a statement by ministry of home affairs.“This would require adequate intervention in geographical areas having higher infection, through measures such as contact tracing, vaccination drives and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” the MHA said.Bhalla also suggested the state governments to explore the possibility of placing night curfew in areas with high test positivity rate.“The state governments were advised that they should continue with their vaccination programmes and incase they required more vaccines, the same would be provided to the extent possible… Efforts must be made to consume the vaccine doses received,” the statement added.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, member health Niti Aayog Dr VK Paul, chief secretaries and police chiefs of both the states also attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/home-secretary-takes-stock-of-kerala-maharashtra-covid-situation-101630003223097.html

The Centre’s counsel sought two days’ time to respond to the query.On Thursday, the counsel for the Union government Daya Sindhu Sreehari informed the court that the gap between the two Covishield jabs was based on a scientific study and the gap was necessary for effectiveness of vaccine.The central government, during the hearing, told the court that all the decisions regarding the vaccination programme are taken by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) and technical inputs are given by the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG).It further said that “based on the recommendation of NEGVAC, the schedule of COVISHIELD vaccination, under the national COVID-19 programme, was to administer the second dose after 12 to 16 weeks. i.e. after 84 days from the first dose”.“This provides the best protection against Covid-19,” the Centre claimed and added that the decision was taken based on efficacy and not availability of the vaccine.kitex in its plea contended that it had vaccinated around 5000 of its work force with the first dose but unable to administer the second dose due to the prevailing restrictions. It sought judicial intervention to speed up the process in view of mounting cases in the state.The UK started off with a gap of 12 weeks between two doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine which is made in India as Covishield by Serum Institute of India, but has progressively shortened this for vulnerable populations after it emerged that only two doses provided adequate protection against variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid.The case is being heard against the backdrop of a flare-up of infections in the southern state, likely caused by Onam celebrations last week.Kerala reported 31,455 cases on Wednesday with a test positivity rate of 19.03%, both highest in three months.The cases reported accounted for 70% of the national total on Wednesday.“We expected a hike after Onam. A special drive is on to increase testing and vaccination. Since sero prevalence is very low in Kerala we have to find the infected and quarantine them at the earliest,” Kerala health minister Veena George said on Wednesday.Meanwhile, responding to another plea,the Union government informed the court that it has no plans for a third dose or a booster dose as of now. A resident of Kannur in north Kerala moved the court saying that he took two doses of Covaxin but since this vaccine was not recognised abroad he was unable to join work in Saudi Arabia. He sought the court’s help for a third dose of Covishield.The Centre also said studies on mixing of vaccine doses were progressing and there was no plan for a third dose as of now.Earlier this month, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) accepted a proposal that a research be conducted to analyse mixing a dose each of Covaxin and Covishield. “Permission has been granted for research study at CMC Vellore on mixing of vaccine doses,” Dr VK Paul, Niti Aayog said at a press briefing on August 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jab-gap-related-to-efficacy-not-availability-govt-to-kerala-hc-101630003163808.html
27-08-2021||India||Zydus vaccine for kids likely to be available by Oct, says Centre||Zydus Cadila’s anti Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine, ZyCov-D, the first approved for use on people as young as 12 in the country , is likely to be available by the first week of October, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said during a briefing by the health ministry on Thursday.It still isn’t clear whether the vaccine will form part of the country’s ongoing drive to vaccinate all adults by the end of the year, or be reserved for the use of children. Currently, only those over the age of 18 years are eligible for vaccines in India. Responding to reports that the children with co-morbidities that made them more vulnerable to serious illness and death from Covid, Bhushan said this was an issue on which “the standing committee on Covid of NTAGI (National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation) makes a recommendation to the full NTAGI”.With a 10-million a month capacity by October (CHECK), the Zydus vaccine will add to overall supply of the jabs in India , albeit to a small extent. In an analysis published on Wednesday, HT pointed out that the country needs to deliver 10 million shots a day between now and the end of the year to meet its target of vaccinating all adults.On August 20, India’s drugs regulator approved the Zydus Cadila vaccine for emergency use. ZyCoV-D, the world’s first plasmid DNA vaccine for Covid-19, is a three-dose vaccine which will be administered on Day zero, Day 28, and Day 56.Bhushan, however, said it was too early to comment on whether the vaccine will be allowed for all children in one go or for those children that suffer from comorbidities.Vaccinating children could help the re-opening of schools. Although research has shown that a high level of coverage among adults also reduces infections among children, India is nowhere close to that. Till Thursday, around 50% of the eligible adults in the country had received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.Experts said that , however, say, if supplies are short then it makes sense to first vaccine children with comorbidities.“Eventually we will have to vaccine all children and not just those at risk because children can bring the infection home and expose those members who are at high risk, especially the elderly and sick in the family,” said Dr JS Bhasin, director and head, department of paediatrics, BLK Hospital.The vaccine was approved by the Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) after its experts assessed results from the company’s phase III clinical trials that showed the vaccine to have an efficacy of 66.6%.The vaccine is delivered via a “painless” intradermal applicator, making it essentially a needle-free vaccine.DNA vaccines stimulate both the humoral and cellular arms of the adaptive immune system according to experts.The vaccine was developed in partnership with the government’s Department of Biotechnology under the ‘Mission COVID Suraksha’, which involved the pooling of resources by several Indian research institutions for development and clinical trials.After receiving the approval, the company announced that it is already stockpiling vaccine doses, and is likely to produce 10 million vaccine doses a month by October.The company also plans to seek approval for a two-dose regimen of the vaccine separately, it announced.The Zydus vaccine is the sixth approved in India for emergency use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-vaccine-for-kids-likely-to-be-available-by-oct-says-centre-101630002687041.html
27-08-2021||India||Chhattisgarh HC order: ‘Sexual act with wife is not rape, even if forced’||The Chhattisgarh high court has discharged a 37-year-old man from the charge of marital rape, saying that sex with a legally wedded wife is not rape under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).The court, however, retained the charges against him under section 377 of the IPC for “unnatural sex”.The order by Justice NK Chandravanshi was issued on August 23 in a revision petition filed by the husband and his family on the charges framed against the man in the trial court, and was made public on Wednesday.The woman -- the two were married in 2017 -- lodged a complaint of dowry harassment and rape against the man. She also accused her parents-in-law of dowry harassment.The police, after a primary investigation submitted a charge sheet under section 498-A (dowry harassment), 377 (unnatural sex), 376 (rape), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the three accused.After hearing counsel for both parties, a trial court framed charges against the applicants under the sections, the order said.Subsequently, the three accused filed a petition with the high court seeking that the order of the trial court be set aside.The HC in its order on August 23 discharged the husband from rape charges.“Counsel for the applicants submits that the complainant and the applicant No. 1 are legally wedded wife and husband, therefore, none of the ingredients to constitute the offence punishable under Sections 376 and 377 of the IPC are spelt out against him, because, in India, marital rape is not recognized and the same is not an offence in view of Exception II of Section 375 of the IPC,” the judge said in his order.The court said that the IPC makes it clear that sex between a man and his wife, as long as the latter is not under 18, is not rape.“In this case, complainant is legally weeded wife of applicant No. 1, therefore, sexual intercourse or any sexual act with her by the husband would not constitute an offence of rape, even if it was by force or against her wish. Therefore, charge under Section 376 of the IPC framed against the applicant husband is erroneous and illegal. Hence, he is entitled to be discharged from the charge under Section 376 of the IPC”, the order stated.A 2013 report submitted by the Justice JS Verma Committee, which was set up after the December 2012 Delhi gang rape, recommended the removal of the marital rape immunity from the IPC but the statute is yet to be amended.In the past, Indian courts have takendivergent and contradictory views in such cases.In July 2019, the Delhi high court dismissed a petition urging it to direct the Centre to declare marital rape a ground for divorce.But earlier this month, the Kerala high court backed marital rape as a valid ground for divorce. A few days later, a sessions court in Maharashtra gave pre-arrest bail to a man while concluding that forcible sex with his wife was not an “illegal thing” though she said it left her paralysed.In 2017, the Supreme Court declared that “sexual intercourse with a girl below 18 years of age is rape regardless of whether she is married or not”. However, the top court refused to delve into the question of marital rape in this judgment.On the woman’s allegation of her husband forced her into an unnatural sex act, the court upheld imposition of section 377 of IPC.The court also upheld the dowry harassment charge framed under section 498-A of the IPC saying the cruelty of the accused has been affirmed through several witnesses.“The entire order is baffling. On one hand it says that ‘intercourse or any sexual act’ is not punishable with legally wedded wife and on another hand, it upholds the charge of unnatural sex. The legal reasoning of both are contradictory...” said lawyer-activist Sudiep Shrivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-order-sexual-act-with-wife-is-not-rape-even-if-forced-101630001543023.html

On March 16, 2020, the police submitted a chargesheet before the Aligarh court and the chief judicial magistrate took cognizance of it.According to section 196(a) of the CrPC, no court shall take cognizance of any offence under section 153A of the IPC except with the previous sanction of the central or the state government or the district magistrate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kafeel-khan-gets-interim-relief-from-allahabad-hc-for-amuspeech-101630001366212.html
27-08-2021||India||PM to unveil renovated Jallianwala Bagh Smarak||Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Saturday, will inaugurate via video-conferencing the renovated complex of Amritsar’s Jallianwala Bagh Smarak, a memorial to those who were martyred in the infamous incident on April 13, 1919, the Prime Minister’s Office informed in a statement on Thursday. He will also inaugurate new museum galleries constructed at the site.“Four museum galleries have been created through adaptive reuse of redundant and underutilised buildings. The galleries showcase the historical value of events that unfolded in Punjab during that period, with the fusion of audio-visual technology, including projection mapping and 3D representation, as well as art and sculptural installations,” a government statement read.The monument of Jallianwala Bagh serves as a remembrance of the indiscriminate killing of unarmed people who had gathered at the garden 102 years ago to protest the arrest of nationalist leaders Dr Satyapal and Saifuddin Kichlew over their agitation against the Rowlatt Act. The colonial administration had imposed martial law in Punjab and banned gatherings. On April 13, 1919, which was Baisakhi, Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer had marched his troops into the garden and ordered them to fire into the unarmed crowd at the garden. To escape the hail of bullets, many people had jumped into a large well in the garden, only to be drowned. It is now called the Shaheedi Well.All this would be brought alive at the renovated memorial through a sound and light show. The government statement also added that the restoration works were carried out in sync with the local architectural style of Punjab.Also Read | Chronicling the conspiracy behind Jallianwala Bagh, 1919“The Shaheedi well has been repaired and restored with a redefined superstructure. The heart of the Bagh, the flame monument, has been repaired and restored, water body rejuvenated as a lily pond, and the pathways made broader for better navigability,” the statement read.It added that key spots at the complex have also been illuminated while newer areas have been developed for housing the ‘Salvation Ground’ and the Amar Jyoti (immortal flame).The British Raj had later released the official casualty count as 350 killed, but the Indian National Congress had disputed it and claimed over 1,000 people were killed.The Union ministers of culture and housing and urban affairs, ministers of state for culture, the governor and chief minister of Punjab will be attending the e-launch along with the chief ministers of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha members from Punjab and members of the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust will also be present on the occasion.Earlier this month, to pay a “fitting tribute” to those killed in India’s struggle for Independence, the Modi government notified August 14 as Partition Horrors Remembrance Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-to-unveil-renovated-jallianwala-bagh-smarak-101630001302874.html
27-08-2021||India||LeT planned successive drone attacks in J&K: Intel||“Ek kaam to ho gaya, doosra baad me dekh lenge (One job is done, second will be taken care of later),” terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba’s handlers from across the border told their counterparts in India after two separate drone-based missions to Jammu and Kashmir on June 27, according to central intelligence agencies who intercepted the conversation.While the first mission referred to was successful, with two sophisticated improvised explosive devices (IEDs) exploding within a gap of six minutes inside Air Force Station, Satwari, Jammu, on June 27, the second mission failed after the Jammu and Kashmir police apprehended Nadeem-ul-Haq, a resident of Ramban, when he was returning after picking up a 5.5kg IED dropped by another drone in Jammu. Two more people — Nadeem Ayoub Rather of Shopian and Talib-ur-Rehman of Banihal were arrested on the same day.The central intelligence agencies have established a link between the two incidents through the audio intercept of LeT handlers in which they can be heard bragging about the success of the first mission (IAF base attack) while vowing to take care of the second mission at a later stage.A counter-terrorism official familiar with the development said, “LeT planned to carry out back-to-back drone attacks on June 27, sending drones probably from the same location in Pakistan. Powered by long-range batteries and flying at the height of 1 to 1.2km, the drones travelled at night. Technical help, including the know-how of global positioning system (GPS) for such operations is provided by the Pakistan Army or the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence).”In the Jammu IAF base attack, the bombs exploded at a distance of 50 yards from each other, and officials believe that the air traffic control (ATC), parked helicopters or radars were the targets.The target of the second IED, picked up by Nadeem-ul-Haq in Bathindi area (Jammu), is not known yet but it was to be used on the same day (June 27) somewhere in Jammu, a second counter-terrorism officer said on condition of anonymity. LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammad are known to share information only on a need-to-know-basis with their overground workers, couriers and operational teams.In both instances, central agencies suspect the drones flew in from a village in Pakistan about 14.5km from Jammu airport. The exact route could not be established as the drones returned after the drops, said the second officer.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is currently investigating both the incidents and has questioned several villagers to trace the possible route of the drones.Counter-terrorism officials cited above explained that LeT/JeM and ISI are increasingly using commercially available drones to avoid capture of their men and for deniability.According to an assessment by security agencies, since August 2019, when the Indian government abrogated Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and ended its special status, there have been close to 300 sightings of drones from across the border.Apart from LeT and Jaish, Khalistani terror organisations operating from Pakistani soil, too, are using drones to drop weapons, explosives and drugs in Punjab. On August 9, an improvised bomb in a tiffin box was dropped in Amritsar, allegedly by a Khalistan terror group.The government has already fast-tracked the process to procure anti-drone technologies in the last couple of months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-planned-successive-drone-attacks-in-j-k-intel-101630001006088.html
27-08-2021||India||Buzz over Chhattisgarh change of guard grows||Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singh Deo on Thursday said that anyone who plays in a team “thinks of being captain”, and chief minister Bhupesh Baghel is set to hold another set of meetings with the Congress leadership in Delhi on Friday, as signs of a possible change in guard in the state become stronger.However, in a show of strength, at least 20 legislators backing Baghel also flew to the Capital late on Thursday night.On Tuesday, Baghel and Singh Deo met senior Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, general secretary in charge of Chhattisgarh PL Punia and general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal to thrash out a solution to the impasse in the state, caused by a power sharing agreement put in place when the government was formed in December 2018.Singh Deo, who has remained in Delhi since the meetings on Tuesday, said, “If a person plays in a team, then doesn’t he think of becoming the captain? Everyone thinks about that but the question is not about thoughts, it’s about capabilities. The high command takes a decision.”The health minister stopped short of referring to any power-sharing deal, saying that the party has never “publicly” spoken about this. He added that there is rivalry even among siblings, and that he would “carry out the responsibility that is given by the “high command.” “He (Bhupesh Baghel) might be the CM for fifty years or ten years or two years. This is not fixed. Healthy competition takes place,” Singh Deo said.Senior leaders close to Baghel said that the CM would hold another set of meetings with the party leadership on Friday, with “many things still not discussed.” “There is a separate meeting of the CM with Rahul Gandhi on Friday.,” a leader close to CM said on condition of anonymity.The Baghel camp said that at least 20 MLAs and three ministers were travelling to Delhi to show their support of the sitting CM. “They are going on their own. They know that if the CM changes, the entire political hierarchy of the state will change,” said a functionary close to the chief minister who asked not to be named.Bhilai MLA Devendra Yadav, one of the lawmakers who left Raipur on Thursday night, said, “In Chhattisgarh, we have been serving the people under the leadership of Bhupesh Baghel. We are going to speak to the Delhi high command on the situation in the state. We are all together.”In December 2018, in the aftermath of a dominant Congress performance where they won 68 of 90 seats, even as the party’s Delhi leadership sought to put out leadership fires in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh emerged as a problem too.Four state leaders, Baghel, current home minister Tamradhwaj Sahu, current speaker Charan Das Mahant and Singh Deo flew to Delhi, all eyeing the CM’s post. As Mahant settled for speaker, friction between Baghel and Singhdeo meant that Sahu first emerged the frontrunner, but pushed by the idea that a third leader would take the top position, Baghel and Singh Deo, along with Punia and Gandhi reportedly came to a power sharing arrangement.Since Tuesday night, when Baghel was welcomed at Raipur airport with a show of strength, the CM has met with at least a dozen legislators and other functionaries close to him at the Raipur circuit house. At the airport, a combative Baghel said that it made him happy that a farmer like him had been given the responsibility of being CM and that “those propagating the two-and-a-half year formula were trying to bring political instability and would never succeed.”Still, among some sections in the state, the sense is growing that a major change could be in the offing. One senior MLA, who spoke to HT said, “I got a hint from people close to CM that change of guard could happen in next few weeks.Most however continued to hedge their bets, waiting for a “final decision” to arrive from Delhi, but urging that one be made quickly. “There is a total chaos because there is no communication from the party high command. We are afraid in taking sides in our party as a small mistake will ruin our political career,” said a legislator who asked not to be named.Leaders close to Singh Deo said that they were staying in Delhi to avoid a situation of competing shows of strength in Raipur, and hoped for a quick declaration. “The stance from the beginning is that we have lived up to what we had promised, and have stayed calm and patient. This is what will continue, and there is no point going to Raipur to cause confrontation without clear directions,” one of them said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/buzz-over-chhattisgarh-change-of-guard-grows-101630000943746.html
27-08-2021||India||CBI registers 9 cases as part of Bengal poll violence investigation||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday registered nine cases related to the post-poll violence in West Bengal, officials familiar with the developments said.Four special teams of the central agency, which were in the state between Monday and Thursday following directions from the Calcutta high court to probe cases of murder, attempt to murder and rape, also visited the affected families in Kolkata and North 24 Parganas to record their statements, they added. Cases were registered in Purulia, Bankura and Nadia districts as well, officials added.While one team visited the kin of Abhijit Sarkar, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker who was allegedly killed by Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers in Kolkata’s Narkeldanga area on May 2, another met the family of Jaiprakash Yadav, a BJP worker who died in a bomb attack by motorcycle-borne assailants at Bhatpara in North 24 Parganas district on June 6.The officials recorded the statement of Biswajit Sarkar, Abhijit’s brother, who was among several petitioners to move the Supreme Court for a probe into the alleged violence. The apex court allowed the Calcutta high court to look into the matter.Abhijit was the only BJP worker to have been killed in the state capital. At least seven persons have been arrested so far.BJP Lok Sabha MP from Barrackpore seat, Arjun Singh, alleged that Yadav was murdered as he worked to ensure the victory of Singh’s son, Pawan, from the Bhatpara assembly seat in the elections.“The attack was carried out by goons backed by Trinamool Congress. Yadav’s skull was blown apart,” said Arjun Singh.According to officials cited above, the first information reports (FIRs) were registered under various sections of the IPC in Purulia, Nadia and Bankura districts as well by the visiting teams.The Central Reserve Police Force has been asked to provide security to the members of the CBI visiting Bengal, a CBI official said on condition of anonymity.Each of these seven-member teams — which comprise deputy inspector generals and superintendents from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Karnataka and other states – is being headed by a joint director and accompanied by forensic experts and officers of inspector rank.Soon after the TMC swept the assembly elections on May 2, the BJP made allegations of widespread post-poll violence from across the state.Following directions from the high court on June 18, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) carried out an investigation and submitted its final report on July 13, recommending a CBI probe and trials outside the state.After studying the NHRC’s final report, the high court last week ordered separate probes by the CBI and a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the state police into the alleged violence.A five-judge bench headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal said the CBI will probe the serious allegations of rape and murder and a three-member SIT those of arson and loot under the court’s supervision.The state government has maintained that the NHRC report was biased and prepared with a political motive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-registers-9-cases-as-part-of-bengal-poll-violence-investigation-101630000766503.html
27-08-2021||India||Oppn parties express concern over India’s external security||The Congress and other opposition parties flagged India’s external security situation, particularly a possible “rise in terrorism” and “the challenges emerging from the re-emergence of the Taliban and its terror links” as “immediate concerns” at the all-parties meeting where external affairs minister S Jaishankar briefed them on the situation in Afghanistan.Even though the Opposition was united in its support to the National Democratic Alliance government on its stand on the Afghanistan crisis, leaders such as Mallikarjun Kharge (Congress), Saugata Ray (Trinamool Congress), NK Premachandran (Revolutionary Socialist Party) and Binoy Viswam (Communist Party of India) raised several key questions to the government on the evacuation of refugees, support to the Afghan people, impact on terrorism, India’s possible alienation in the region, and the tricky subject of engagement with the Taliban. Later, some opposition leaders alleged that they did not get satisfactory answers to some questions.After foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla made a powerpoint presentation on the evacuation of refugees by India, several opposition leaders posed questions. They asked if after August 31, which is the deadline for the American troops to leave Afghanistan, some Indians remain stranded in that country, “what would be the government of India’s evacuation strategy”.While a Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader talked about the possibility of Indians being stranded in other cities such as Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif, a Congress leader wanted to know if the government had an estimate on the number of Indians still stuck in Afghanistan. “The government admitted there are no estimates but assured that all Indians would be evacuated,” the Congress leader said. TMC’s Saugata Ray handed over a list of 125 people from West Bengal stuck in Afghanistan.The Congress expressed concern that there might be a rise in terrorism that would impact the regional security situation and suggested the adoption of “the strongest possible counter-terrorism measures” and the shoring up of India’s defences in Jammu and Kashmir. A non-Congress member asked about China’s possible nexus with the Taliban regime and Pakistan but claimed the government avoided giving any answers.Also Read | India’s only investment in Afghanistan is on its people, will get full-value in return: JaishankarA Congress leader also wanted to know if India is talking to the Taliban and argued that there was news of secret talks being held in Doha with them. He asked “whether such conversations were held”, and if they were, “what was the outcome of those deliberations”.The Congress and some other parties also pointed out the “perception” that India appears to be “isolated from our traditional allies in the region”. “What diplomatic or other strategic steps are being planned to strengthen our position both in the short term and in the long term?” questioned one of the leaders.Some parties suggested that India should not abandon the Afghan people as they like India and hate Pakistan. “It is very essential that India provides a sense of assurance and strongly expresses our solidarity with the people of Afghanistan and upholds the principles of fundamental rights and freedoms. What steps for humanitarian assistance are being taken by the government of India?” a leader asked.They also pointed out that Rangina Kargar, a woman member of the Afghan parliament was deported from New Delhi when she came in from Istanbul on August 20. According to the opposition, the government admitted its mistake and assured that such incidents will not happen in future.Viswam later tweeted, “Jayasankarji conducted the meeting in a democratic manner. congrats to him. Alas, his govt. had no answers for crucial questions: 1How many Indians stranded in Afghanistan? 2As our embassy is shut down, who will take care for their lives? 3Why US preponedtroop withdrawl to 15 Aug?

27-08-2021||India||Evacuation ops, helping Afghans priority: Centre at all-party meet||India’s priorities in Afghanistan are evacuating all its nationals and helping Afghans in distress, even as New Delhi waits to see whether the Taliban forms a new set-up on its own or shares power with others, the government told leaders of political parties on Thursday.External affairs minister S Jaishankar and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla briefed parliamentary leaders of 31 parties on the latest developments in Afghanistan after the capital Kabul was captured by the Taliban on August 15 following the collapse of the Ashraf Ghani government.The situation in Afghanistan is fluid and India is keeping a close watch on developments as it continues consultations with important stakeholders and regional countries. The Indian side is also continuing its engagement with the Afghan people and closely monitoring political and security developments, the MPs were told.Jaishankar told the lawmakers that India’s immediate priorities in the current circumstances included evacuating all Indian nationals and providing assistance to Afghan nationals in distress, according to people familiar with the briefing.In a detailed presentation for the MPs, the foreign secretary said the Indian side is watching whether the new set-up in Kabul will be solely a government of the Taliban or there will be power-sharing with other Afghan leaders, the people said on condition of anonymity.Union minister and leader of the house in the Rajya Sabha, Piyush Goyal, and parliamentary affairs minister Prahlad Joshi were present during the briefing held at the Parliament annexe. The briefing was attended by 37 leaders from 31 parties, including NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of the Congress party in Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, former Union minister Anand Sharma, TR Baalu of the DMK, and former prime minister HD Deve Gowda.Jaishankar said in a string of tweets: “Our immediate concern and task is evacuation and long term interest is the friendship for the Afghan people.” He said evacuation operations were conducted in “extremely difficult conditions especially at the airport”.The foreign minister noted in his tweets that there is “longstanding national sentiment on Afghanistan”, as well as “national concern now at developments”. India’s strong friendship with the Afghan people is reflected in more than 500 development projects, and this friendship “will continue to guide us”, he said. He added “India’s footprint and activities” in Afghanistan will be shaped by “ongoing changes”.The people cited above said the MPs were informed that India, which holds the rotating presidency of the UN Security Council for August, convened a special session on Afghanistan on August 16 and also made a statement at a session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.The broad message conveyed by most Security Council members was that the world community should use all tools to suppress the global terrorist threat in Afghanistan and guarantee that basic human rights are respected.India also currently chairs the UN 1988 sanctions committee, which oversees the designation and delisting of Taliban leaders. The sanctions committee is expected to play a key role in the issue of extending a travel exemption for sanctioned top Taliban leaders such as Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in September.Shringla informed the MPs about pre-emptive measures taken by India since last year, when the Taliban launched a campaign of attacks and violence following the signing of a peace deal with the US in February 2020. He noted the security situation was closely tracked as there was a history of attacks on Indian diplomatic premises in Afghanistan, including attacks on the embassy in 2008, 2009 and 2010.The pre-emptive measures included withdrawing India-based personnel from the consulates in Herat and Jalalabad in April 2020, scaling down personnel at the embassy in Kabul and closing the old chancery building in June this year, and evacuating personnel from the consulate in Kandahar during July 10-11, and from the consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif during August 10-11 in special military flights.The Indian embassy issued a series of security advisories for Indian nationals on June 29, July 24, and August 10 and 12. The final advisories asked Indians to leave immediately and warned them about the discontinuation of commercial flights.The external affairs ministry also set up a 24x7 special cell on Afghanistan and launched an e-visa system for Afghan nationals in distress.The government has so far evacuated a total of 565 people, including 175 embassy personnel, 263 other Indian nationals, 112 Afghan nationals, including Hindus and Sikhs, and 15 nationals of third countries. The government also facilitated the evacuation of Indians by other agencies.Among the challenges faced during the evacuation were frequent incidents of firing near Kabul airport and inside the city, multiple checkpoints set up by different groups, logistics and other issues at the airport, uncertainty in obtaining landing permissions for aircraft, and obtaining overflight clearances from regional countries since Indian military aircraft can’t use Pakistani airspace.A multi-agency team of Indian personnel deployed at Kabul airport has coordinated with NATO and US for landing permissions and access to the airport for evacuees. India also hired a local security agency to escort evacuees to the airport.The external affairs ministry’s special cell on Afghanistan, set up on August 16 to coordinate repatriation and other requests, attended 3,014 calls, responded to nearly 8,000 messages on WhatsApp and answered more than 3,101 emails.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/evacuation-ops-helping-afghans-priority-centre-at-all-party-meet-101630000286479.html
27-08-2021||India||Kerala officer who exposed illegal tree felling seeks security citing threats||Forest officer P Dhanesh Kumar, who played a key role in bringing rampant felling of protected rosewood and teak trees in Kerala’s ecologically fragile Wayanad to light in June, has sought protection for himself and his family citing threats. In a letter to the Special Investigation Team (SIT), probing the case, and the chief conservator of forest Arun RS, Kumar said people close to the accused were tracking his movements. He added he suspected a threat to him and his family. Kumar said when he questioned some of the accused last month, he was threatened in front of the jail officials. He alleged the main accused Roji Augustin threatened to implicate him in sedition and narcotic substances cases. Augustin is among the 12 people arrested in the case.Also Read | Shashi Tharoor checks on ‘patient Kerala’ at ‘roadside ICU’ during IYC protest“I regularly get threat calls. Even some of my family members were also threatened. Hence, it is humbly requested to give adequate protection to my life,” he said in the letter, which was leaked to the media. HT has seen a copy of the letter. Both Kumar and Arun R S refused to comment even as a police officer said Kumar will be given protection. The SIT has registered 300-odd cases in connection with the illegal felling. But conservationists and opposition leaders allege there is an attempt to protect the accused and forest officials who allegedly helped them. The forest department last month sought strict action against forest official N T Sajan for his alleged role in the illegal tree felling, but no action has been taken against him. Sajan allegedly helped the accused and tried to sabotage the case initially. He was transferred from Kozhikode to Kollam after the case surfaced.State forest minister A K Saseendran denied allegations of weakening the case. “The SIT is conducting a thorough investigation. If found guilty, nobody will be spared; let the final report come.” Opposition leader V D Satheesan questioned why the government was “scared” of acting against Sajan. “There is enough evidence against him. He even tried to implicate some of the upright officials,” he said. Satheesan accused the Chief Minister’s Office of protecting Sajan. In October 2020, the state revenue department issued an order allowing the felling of rosewood and teak grown by farmers on the revenue land allotted to them. Misusing the order, smugglers felled trees worth crores on private and forest land. As many as 101 rosewood trees were found to have been cut and smuggled. Kumar played a role in exposing the cutting of trees in Wayanad. Similar cases later surfaced in Idukki and a few other districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-officer-who-exposed-illegal-tree-felling-seeks-security-citing-threats-101629975922338.html
27-08-2021||India||Row in Kerala over 1921 Malabar rebellion||Reports about the removal of the people killed in the 1921 Malabar rebellion, including its leader Variyamkunnath Kunjahammed Haji, from the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR)’s “Dictionary of Martyrs of India Freedom Struggle” has kicked up a row in Kerala. Assembly speaker MB Rajesh on Wednesday compared Haji with freedom fighter Bhagat Singh, prompting an angry reaction from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The Hindu last week reported that a three-member panel, which reviewed the entries in the fifth volume of the dictionary, recommended the removal. The panel was of the opinion that the 1921 rebellion was never part of the independence struggle, the report added.Some historians and Left parties say the rebellion, also known as the Mappila uprising, was the first such against British colonialism in south India. Hindu groups and a section of historians contend it was a communal riot and Hindus suffered as a result. The rebellion was followed another massacre when 64 people arrested over it suffocated to death while they were being transported in a closed railway wagon to Coimbatore for trial. There is a memorial to them at Kerala’s Tirur railway station. The British captured and executed Haji in 1921.Also Read | Kerala alone accounts for over 68% of India’s new Covid-19 caseloadRajesh insisted that the attempt to delink the rebellion from the freedom struggle was aimed at dividing people. He added that the essence of rebellion was anti-British and anti-feudal but admitted there were some instances of what he termed “communal deviations”. “In an uprising, there can be some aberrations also. You cannot dismiss it as a communal riot. Terming it just a communal riot is a big injustice,” he said at an event in Kozhikode marking the year-long commemoration of 100 years of the rebellion.BJP leader and Union minister V Muraleedharan condemned the move to brand Haji a freedom fighter. “Ignorance is not an offence. But feigning ignorance for cheap political and communal gains is an offence. The sinister ploy to divide people on communal lines is unpardonable. Left parties are repeating their mistakes,” he said.BJP leader MT Ramesh said his party will oppose any attempt to glorify Haji while Hindu Aikya Vedi, a right-wing group, has decided to observe a black day at all venues where the rebellion is being commemorated.Haji’s family plans a sit-in in Malappuram to protest against attempts to sully his image. “ ICHR can delete his name from the dictionary but not from the minds of people,” said C P Ibrahim, one of his descendants.Hindu groups asked actor Prithviraj Sukumaran not to play Haji’s role two years ago when Malayalam filmmaker Aashiq Abu announced a movie on the Mappila rebellion. The film is scheduled to be screened by year-end. In 1988, a movie titled 1921 on the issue was a big hit.DID HE PLAY THE PART OR NOT? Historians are divided over the issue with KKN Kurup saying the rebellion was part of the freedom movement. Another historian MGS Narayanan said the move to omit Haji from the list of freedom fighters was “politically motivated.”Historian C I Issac said: “It was in fact a jihadi movement. Its main aim was to establish a religious province. It is quite unfair and illogical to give a nationalistic colour to a communal riot.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-in-kerala-over-1921-malabar-rebellion-101629958460607.html
27-08-2021||India||Ensure studies of kids orphaned due to Covid are not hindered: SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday directed all states and Union territories to ensure that the education of children orphaned on account of the Covid-19 pandemic continue without disruption -- including in private schools, at least during the ongoing academic year.A bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose suggested that this objective can be achieved by asking schools to waive fees or the state bearing half the expenses to reduce the burden on the affected children. The Court asked the states to come out with a policy in this regard in four weeks after having discussion with the private schools.“State governments are directed to act in cohesion with Child Welfare Committees and District Education Officers in having dialogue with private schools in which children in need are studying and see that their education for this year is not disrupted. This can be done by asking the schools to waive fees or the state bearing burden of part of fees,” the bench said.While the court was initially dictating the order for Andhra Pradesh in a suo motu case taken up to deal with the issue of such children, it later made it applicable to all states and Union territories.The court’s observation came on a day when the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) said at least 100,000 children lost one or both parents during the first and second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.In an affidavit filed through advocate Swarupama Chaturvedi, the commission, which has been running a dedicated website called Bal Swaraj for collecting such data, said that 101,032 children were abandoned, became orphans or lost one of their parents due to Covid-19 or other reasons between April 1, 2020 and August 23, 2021.Of this, the commission added, there were 8,161 orphans, 396 children were abandoned and 92,475 lost one of their parents. The affidavit specified that the deaths were caused by a variety of reasons, including Covid-19.“The data of children uploaded on the Bal Swaraj portal by the states/UTs comprises both categories of children, wherein the child has lost both or either of the parent to Covid-19 disease or otherwise from April 2020 onwards,” the affidavit read.The affidavit was submitted in response to another suo motu petition being heard by the top court for identification and rehabilitation of children who lost either or both their parents during the pandemic. The court is being assisted by amicus curiae (friend of Court) advocate Gaurav Agrawal in this case.While going through the report of the amicus curiae for each state, the bench said, “Our main concern is children in distress are taken care of and their education in private schools continues unhindered at least for this academic year.”In respect of around 2600 children registered under the PM CARES for Children scheme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May this year, the court allowed the concerned states to request the Centre for releasing funds to meet the payment of fees of children studying in private schools for this academic year.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati appearing for Centre submitted that PM CARES for Children scheme has provision for providing fees of children orphaned due to COVID-19 at the private schools, besides supporting them with expenses for uniform and books. Bhati said that this benefit is extended only to orphans due to COVID-19 and will not include those abandoned or who still have a surviving parent. Further, the Centre pointed out that the benefit can accrue only when district magistrates approve the beneficiaries. Out of 2600 children, only 418 have been approved till date.This is the third affidavit filed by the NCPCR in the matter. In an earlier affidavit providing information received from states up to July 23, the commission presented a figure of 6,855 orphans, 68,218 children who lost one parent, and 247 abandoned children.In its last hearing on July 27, the court pulled up the West Bengal government over the state’s low figure on the number of children orphaned during the pandemic.The court said it was not prepared to believe that in a big state like West Bengal, only 27 children lost both parents due to Covid-19 since April 1, 2020, and called for a response by the secretary of the Women and Child Welfare department to give the correct particulars.The latest affidavit of NCPCR showed that the state had registered 308 orphans and 6,270 children who lost either of their parents, besides two children found abandoned from April 2020 till August 23.Maharashtra is the only state in the country which has recorded a five digit figure of children affected during the reporting period with 470 children orphaned and 14,925 children who lost either of their parents, taking the total number of affected children to 15,401 (including six abandoned children).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-100-000-kids-were-orphaned-or-lost-a-parent-since-april-2020-ncpcr-to-sc-101629957380536.html
27-08-2021||Today's||In India, the democratisation of air travel||It has been four years since the central government, under the leadership of Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, embarked on the ambitious task of building a strong and affordable regional aviation system in India. The UDAN scheme has been seminal in its impact, having triggered air connectivity to hitherto unserved regions.The development and expansion of regional airports such as Darbhanga, Jharsuguda, Kadapa, Nasik, Belagavi, Jagdalpur, Hubli and Kishangarh have brought new destinations onto India’s aviation map and the concomitant unlocking of new economic opportunities in these regions (such as cargo) that were completely unexplored until five years ago.For instance, the Darbhanga airport, which was built at the time of Independence, and was fully functional from 1950 to 1962, had been wiped off the aviation map. The airstrip was revived under the UDAN scheme, and is now seen as a critical gateway for northern Bihar to the rest of the country. The airport offers connectivity with six to 10 major cities, and currently handles over 150,00 passengers annually.The Belgavi airport has facilitated travel for students to Belgaum, an education hub. The airport is being utilised for cargo operations as well, and soon will operate a flight training school — all in the span of a few years. Similarly, the Rupsi airport in Assam currently serves four key districts in Assam, as well as the neighbouring states of West Bengal, Meghalaya, and some parts of Bhutan.Also Read | The cost of crime and criminal justice in IndiaThe Jharsuguda airport in Odisha, another relic of the World War II era, was revamped for operations in 2019. Prior to this, the entire western Odisha region was uncatered for, and the only airport in Odisha was located in Bhubaneshwar, which is 339 km away from Jharsaguda. The airport handled more than 200,000 passengers in 2020-21 with 140 aircraft movements per week. The scheme has also opened up new modes of air transport such as helicopters which are providing access over 16 routes in the remotest areas of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.The UDAN scheme has given birth to as many success stories on the other end of the spectrum too i.e; airline operators. We have witnessed a proliferation of new regional carriers, some having pivoted their businesses on the UDAN model: Participation of airline operators in Regional Connectivity Scheme-UDAN rose from five to 11 in the last two years.Additionally, we were able to operationalise seven airports, two heliports and one water aerodrome in the last year despite the disruptions caused by Covid-19. Here’s why.Our metro routes are adequately served, and major airports such as Delhi and Mumbai have already reached the zenith of their passenger-handling capacities. It is but natural that the path ahead for the growth of civil aviation will be paved with greater regional and remote connectivity, and building and serving more underserved or unserved airports/airstrips.This would fundamentally change civil aviation from an elitist mode of transportation to one where even a person who wears a “hawai chappal” can travel by a “hawai jahaz” — as spelt out under the PM’s vision.This democratisation of air travel and opening up to a high-volume, low-cost model for civil aviation, much along the lines of the telecom revolution in India, will also have a tremendous bearing on allied sectors such as air cargo, which quite remarkably, boomed during the Covid-19 times. The share of Indian carriers in the international cargo business has increased from 2% to 19% in the last two years.Also Read | Joe Biden has got it wrongDuring the lockdown, air cargo proved to be a lifeline not only for essential commodities, but also for our farmers to ship agri-perishables, especially from the Northeast. Now, with Krishi Udaan becoming the next focal point for the government, air cargo may well become a major force multiplier for the overall growth of the civil aviation sector in India.At the macro level, the true benefits of this scheme will accrue in the form of huge economic paybacks in the long run. A study by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) reveals that the output and employment multipliers of the aviation sector are 3.25 and 6.10 respectively i.e. every ₹100 spent on air transport contributes ₹325 to economic output; and for every 100 direct jobs birthed in air transport, 610 jobs are created in the economy as a whole. Thankfully, the government took cognisance of this potential early on, and has been proactively supporting and engaging the aviation sector.Pre-Covid-19, India was the third-largest domestic aviation market in the world with over 341 million passengers having travelled in FY20. The country was poised to become the third-largest overall market in three years till the Covid-19 headwinds hit markets across the world. However, a huge inequality among flyers has been observed across the world. As per a study by climate campaign group, Possible, in India, only 1% of our households take 45% of the flights, and so, in terms of our potential, we have only scratched the surface.Under the visionary leadership of PM Modi, the government’s flagship UDAN scheme has allowed a huge chunk of first-time flyers to take flight trips at the cost of a first-class AC train ticket. And by connecting regional skies, we have begun the process of democratising and universalising the tenet that we can all “reach for the skies”!Jyotiraditya Scindia is the Union minister for civil aviation The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-india-the-democratisation-of-air-travel-101630069349088.html
27-08-2021||Today's||It is time to end the debate on marital rape in India||A division bench of the Kerala high court (HC) comprising Justice A Muhamed Mustaque and Justice Kauser Edappagath in a case recently held that “a husband’s licentious disposition disregarding the autonomy of the wife is a marital rape, albeit such conduct cannot be penalised, it falls in the frame of physical and mental cruelty.” This new judicial interpretation of cruelty as grounds for divorce is also espoused in section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act.In another judgment by the Chhattisgarh HC on August 23, in a criminal revision, the court relied on Exception II of Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), stating: “...sexual intercourse or sexual act by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under eighteen years of age, is not rape. In this case, [the] complainant is legally wedded wife of applicant No. 1, therefore, sexual intercourse or any sexual act with her by the applicant No. 1/husband would not constitute an offence of rape, even if it was by force or against her wish.”Exception II to Section 375 refers to sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his wife, the wife not being under 15 years old, is not rape. This implies that marital sex with a woman who is over the age of 15 is not rape, even if it is without her consent.Also Read | Minister blames survivor, says Oppn trying to ‘rape’ himBut in October 2017, in Independent Thought v. the Union of India, the Supreme Court (SC) ruled that sex with one’s minor wife, who is below 18 years old, would amount to rape — even with her consent. This effectively means that the law in the country penalises marital rape only where the wife is below 18 years old.Legally, there’s no anomaly between the two judgments as the Kerala HC judgment adjudicates a civil dispute and the Chhattisgarh HC adjudicates a criminal dispute. Legal principles are different in civil and criminal law. However, the judgments create a legal paradox for the future.The Kerala HC refers to the “autonomy of wife”, invoking the constitutional right to privacy in the institution of marriage. “Treating wife’s body as something owing to [the] husband and committing [a] sexual act against her will is nothing but marital rape. Right to respect for his or her physical and mental integrity encompass[es] bodily integrity, any disrespect or violation of bodily integrity is a violation of individual autonomy.” The Bench went beyond carving the ratio, writing an extensive obiter dictum in the judgment, which will have a significant impact on matrimonial jurisprudence.In an epilogue, constituting obiter dicta, it said: “Autonomy is now considered as a part of privacy and ennobled as a fundamental right... In a changed scenario of marriage in the society, shifting from the social philosophy to individual philosophy, we are afraid whether the present divorce law on enumerated grounds would stand to the test of constitutionality.”The argument is that if individual autonomy in a marital relationship is ennobled as a fundamental right, then marital sex without consent ought to be criminalised. If it is not criminal, then there can’t be individual autonomy in marriage, because individual autonomy and lifetime consent for sex in marriage are mutually exclusive propositions.Historically and universally, matrimonial jurisprudence has upheld the Anglo tradition that solemnisation of marriage results in giving unconditional and lifetime consent to sexual intercourse by the wife. It is this convention that the Kerala HC has challenged through its judgment.In the past, the SC has turned down petitions seeking the criminalisation of marital rape on multiple occasions stating that it is not in its jurisdiction and it is for Parliament to take a call. In 2019, the Delhi HC even turned down a petition seeking a declaration of marital rape as a ground of divorce — which the Kerala HC has judicially recognised in its judgment. The Law Commission (172nd Report, 2000) has opposed criminalising marital rape on the ground that it may amount to excessive interference with the marital relationship and refused to amend Section 375 in these terms. The government believes that if marital rape is penalised, the family system will be in tatters.The Kerala HC and Chhattisgarh HC judgments, along with the Independent Thought verdict, establish the need for a debate on marital rape because there can’t be an “artificial distinction” between the social predicament of a wife below 18 and above. It is unreasonable to say that a wife below 18 years has bodily integrity, but loses it on the attainment of the age of majority. Bodily integrity is inviolable at any age.The Kerala HC emphatically talks of “individual autonomy” which means consent in the “normal” sex life of a couple is itself a material question. Sexual violence and perversion are wrong, invoking both civil and criminal provisions. Consent in sexual violence and perversion is beyond question, but if consent in the normal sexual life of a couple is under consideration — as is implied by the Kerala HC by using terms such as individual autonomy and right to privacy — then any sexual act in a marriage without consent is criminal. It is for the apex court to clear the air.Seema Sindhu is a practising lawyer at Supreme Court.

27-08-2021||Today's||Joe Biden has got it wrong||For almost a month in November-December of 2001, Khyber (I am not using his full name given the conditions in Afghanistan) was by my side wherever I went — to Tora Bora, Jalalabad where Osama bin Laden was seen last; the dreaded Pul-e-Charkhi prison outside Kabul; or an appointment with a senior member of the Northern Alliance.Khyber, a Kabul University student who wore baggy jeans and an oversized leather coat, was my interpreter. He was at my guesthouse at 8am and left late at night. We had at least one meal a day together and when we travelled, we stayed in the same room. Hotel rooms were at a premium in Afghanistan those days. On the Tora Bora trip, four of us were packed in one room, Khyber, our driver, the AK-47-wielding security guard and me.But Khyber was more than my interpreter. He was my guide to Afghanistan, the key to understanding a simple people caught in a complex web of circumstances.Also Read | The cost of crime and criminal justice in IndiaI worked with another Afghan interpreter on a trip to Mazar-e-Sharif, the capital of Balkh, and Sheberghan, the capital of the adjoining province of Jowzjan, a few months later in 2002. Let’s call him C. I am not sure if he would like to be identified even by his first name because he said he worked on and off with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).He had shown me a GPS tracker, which, he said, was given by the Americans. C was my interpreter when I interviewed Abdul Rashid Dostum, the Uzbek warlord who would go on to become vice-president of Afghanistan, and Mohammed Mohaqiq, a top Hazara leader.As the Americans evacuated Afghans in recent weeks, I wondered if Khyber and C were among them.Back in 2001 and 2002, they had seemed eager to work with foreigners, actually enthusiastic about it. Though the money was good — at rates fixed by the Afghan foreign ministry — it could not have been the sole or chief motivation.They were driven by their belief that Afghanistan had moved on. That the Taliban, which had fled Kabul, was done, gone. And the 1996-2001 Taliban regime was a nightmare that would never recur. The British, who occupied Kabul from 1838 to 1842, did not invade Afghanistan again (they played only a supporting role in the invasion of 2001); and the erstwhile Soviet Union did not repeat its 1979 invasion.But the Taliban returned, handed back the country they had abused, mauled and looted for five years and then abandoned, outmatched by American firepower.I am not sure if Khyber and C follow US politics. Robert Gates, a former CIA director who served as secretary of defence to a Republican president, George W Bush, and a Democrat, Barack Obama, had this to say about President Joe Biden in his 2014 memoir: “I think he has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.”The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/joe-biden-has-got-it-wrong-101630067969240.html
27-08-2021||Today's||Afghanistan’s anarchic jihadist landscape||The Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) has claimed responsibility for the attacks on Kabul airport on August 26. The terror strike, which happened in the final days of the United States (US)-led withdrawal from Afghanistan, accelerated by the Taliban’s takeover, has reportedly claimed the lives of more than 13 US soldiers along with over 90 Afghan civilians. Prior to this, since the inception of the ISKP in 2015, only one US soldier had died in operations against the terror group.Despite the Taliban being a predominant part of the Afghan jihadist landscape, it is imperative to remember that more than 20 terror groups have thrived in Afghanistan. Many of these groups are not Afghan and come from the neighbourhood due to the availability of safe spaces, resources, and access to financial tools such as smuggling, opium cultivation and arms trade. All of this is tied to a level of ideological cohesion and acceptance of the fact the Taliban reigns supreme — but this has not prevented deep differences and conflict among these groups.The US withdrawal has thrown up a striking contrast between claims and reality. President Joe Biden has claimed that “al-Qaeda is gone”, and maintained that the US mission has been accomplished as it got the perpetrators of 9/11. At the same time, Khalil Haqqani, who, as per the US state department, has ties to al-Qaeda, gave a speech at a mosque in the middle of Kabul. Both Biden’s own intelligence apparatus, as well as the United Nations (UN), have highlighted that al-Qaeda very much remains. Even though the US and the Taliban signed a deal in January 2020 in which the latter agreed to disallow al-Qaeda, it has already backtracked on its commitment. And now with little US intelligence presence in Afghanistan, the Taliban-al-Qaeda nexus is free to surge once again.Also Read | Over 550 people, including over 260 Indians, evacuated from Afghanistan: GovtBut there are others too. The Taliban views — and uses — groups such as ISKP as both a threat and an opportunity. ISKP has fought against the Taliban in Afghanistan, with both having different interpretations of what an Islamic state should look like. The Taliban offered itself as a force against ISKP, and this found resonance in both western and eastern capitals.Afghan forces have regularly dismantled the hierarchies of ISKP. After the Taliban conquest, it reportedly executed former ISKP leader Abu Omar Khorasani. Other fighters are either going to merge into pro-Taliban factions in various provinces or lie low till they are able and capable to regroup.Interestingly, the initial cadre of ISKP was widely known to be former Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters, pushed across the Durand Line into Afghanistan by Pakistan’s military operations. In its formative years, a Pashtun-heavy ISKP was also infiltrated by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which offered weapons and money.Despite Pakistan’s blessing for the Afghan Taliban, the TTP has often conducted attacks inside Pakistan and has become emboldened on the back of the victory of the Afghan Taliban. The group’s leader, Noor Wali Mehsud, appeared on CNN, saying that the Taliban’s victory is a victory of all Muslim people. The TTP is a wild card in this theatre. Pakistan hosts most of the Taliban’s shuras, and backs the Haqqani Network, the “sword arm” of the Taliban that now reportedly controls Kabul. But Pakistan is yet to gain leverage over the TTP.One of the best methodologies to view other terror groups in Afghanistan is to investigate the country’s jihad ecosystem from the outside in. The TTP is not only a made-in-Pakistan issue for Pakistan itself, but has also dragged China in. A recent terror strike in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that killed nine Chinese engineers was blamed on the TTP along with the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a group having ties with Uyghur extremism in China’s restive Xinjiang province. Beijing’s push to control ETIM is not new and has previously brought it at odds with its ally, Pakistan.Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has said he did not want militants from Afghanistan coming into his country. Islamists from places such as Chechnya and Dagestan have previously joined groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda while other mujahideen from the Arab world along with those from Central Asia and beyond also joined the Bosnian war between 1992 and 1995. For both China and Russia, domestic considerations have played a significant role in their decision to build a rapport with the Taliban.In all of this, the country that gets short-changed significantly is India. Groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), designed to target Kashmir, have found little attention in the ongoing international discourse around Afghanistan. Much like the Taliban, the LeT and the JeM also run on the support of the “Rawalpindi Shura”, with the Pakistan military and its intelligence cohort in the ISI offering support in both cash and kind. Reports of ISI chief Lieutenant-General Faiz Hameed meeting the Taliban in Kandahar and JeM chief Mufti Rauf meeting the Taliban’s deputy chief and Mullah Omar’s son, Mullah Yaqoob, showcase the web that Pakistan has managed to create for itself in Afghanistan. But even as Pakistan sets itself up once again, in Steve Cohen’s memorable words, to negotiate with the world with a gun to its own head, the real victims remain the Afghans.How the Taliban handles this heterogeneous landscape and these complexities, while attempting to politically mainstream itself, will be its biggest test. As scholar Harsh Pant noted, in Afghanistan, there is never an endgame, but always a game in progress.Kabir Taneja is fellow, Strategic Studies Programme, Observer Research Foundation, and the author of The ISIS Peril: The World’s Most Feared Terror Group and its Shadow on South Asia The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/afghanistans-anarchic-jihadist-landscape-101630067609039.html
27-08-2021||Today's||The cost of crime and criminal justice in India||Crime and its management are becoming increasingly costlier. And this impacts us in two ways: First, the cost of managing crime often results in diverting resources, including budgetary allocations from other areas of governance. Second, crime impacts the quality of life and the levels of happiness in society.Along with its humanitarian costs, internal and external armed conflicts pose a risk to the country’s economic growth and development. Measuring the economic consequences of violence, therefore, becomes pertinent in developing resilient initiatives and optimally allocating resources.National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data revealed that 120,980 cases of non-heinous crimes were reported in the first quarter of 2021, while the number stood at 111,419 last year. There were 1,217 more cases of snatching reported in 2021 (3,829) compared to 2020 (2,612).India does not officially estimate the cost of crimes, unlike other countries. For instance, the crime calculator devised in the United States (US) estimates the aggregate cost of six major offences to the tune of $5,176.45, according to RAND, a non-profit research and analysis institution.Crime and Covid-19Crime is a major affront to peace in society. In its 2021 report, the Global Peace Index depicts a world in which, despite the hostilities and upheavals of the previous decade having subsided, they have been replaced by a new wave of unrest and instability due to Covid-19 and escalating tensions between several global powers. The index ranked India 135 of 163 nations and reveals critical aspects of India’s evolving security situation as well as their impact on economic growth.Also Read | Climate risk maps can mitigate the crisis and protect vulnerable livesOver the past year, India’s overall peacefulness has improved by 0.7% (Global Peace Index, 2021), owing to improvements in the arena of ongoing conflict, but the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has been ruinous, with the number of cases across the country prompting repeated lockdowns. According to some estimates, India’s economy contracted by 7.3% in the last year.The full scale of this pandemic on global peace is still unfolding. It has been observed that while some forms of violence have decreased in the short-term, mounting frustrations, unease and economic instability due to frequent lockdowns have resulted in increased civil and political unrest in India.Crime and conflictIt is estimated that India lost more than a trillion dollars of its GDP to violence in the past few years. During 2014-2018, the cost of violence incurred by the country went from $177 billion in 2014 to $742 billion in 2016 (Global Peace Index, 2017). India’s security concerns are also exacerbated by the convergence of interests between China and Pakistan. Additionally, the deepening of Chinese influence in Nepal has increased the threat to India’s internal security. The porousness of the border makes cross-border trafficking of contraband, weapons, and personnel relatively easy.Further, the continued unrest in Kashmir has increased tensions between India and Pakistan in the past few years. The recent incident of drone attacks in Kashmir uncovers a new page in terror tactics. Consequently, the country has seen a gradual increase in the allocation of budget for internal security issues. In the budget released by the Government of India in 2020-2021, $66.9 billion has been set aside for the ministry of defence. It has been observed that the primary contributor to the cost of containing violence is military expenditure. The data published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute released in April 2021 states that in 2020, India was the third-highest military spender in the world, behind the US and China (SIPRI Report: Trends in World Military Expenditure, April 2021).Also Read | In Kabul, India’s twin agendaThis hefty rise in manpower costs substantially increases the cost of the economic impact of violence and results in concerns about the sustainability of India’s defence modernisation. Lowering the cost of violence can result in a higher peace dividend towards India, but increasing terror attacks on the security forces coupled with geopolitical realities, make the realisation of the dream highly unlikely.The economics of crimeContrary to popular belief, Indian states do not spend enough on the criminal justice system. It has been observed that this pandemic has exacerbated the woes of the chronically under-funded justice system in India. It can be observed that the three heads of costs at all levels of governance are: Policing costs, legal and prosecution costs, and prison costs, in addition to many other indirect fallouts of crime. The India Justice Report 2020 shows that the increase in budgets for the police, prisons and the judiciary have not kept pace with the overall increase in state expenditure. Over five years, while police budgets, on average accounted for 3-5% of state expenditure, average prison budgets across states and Union Territories (UTs) stood at only 0.2%.The cost of crimeAccording to the India Justice Report, the majority of large and mid-sized states (Bihar and Punjab) spent between 3% and 5% of their overall budget on policing, whereas some states, such as Nagaland, Mizoram, and Manipur, spent as much as 6-13% due to their unique conditions. Goa had the highest growth in the country, exceeding the state’s overall spending by 4.4 percentage points. This means that if Goa’s overall state spending climbed by an average of 12.6% over the five-year period, policing spending grew by an average of 17%. With respect to the prison system, states continue to place a low priority on prison expenditure. Only four of the 16 states/UTs with the highest increase in jail spending. An overall analysis of this report could represent that poor budgeting has resulted in capacity restrictions in the judicial system.While these inputs present us with a good starting point, detailed studies are required to document the true cost of crime and criminal justice in India. Efforts are underway to revamp the criminal laws of our country. A holistic overhauling of the criminal justice system, however, requires us to develop a better understanding of the cost behind crime and criminal justice. Therefore, a cost of crime calculator based upon scientifically sound methodology is urgently needed for better planning of criminal justice in India.GS Bajpai is vice-chancellor, Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law, PunjabThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-cost-of-crime-and-criminal-justice-in-india-101630059328509.html
27-08-2021||Editorials||The Islamic State strikes terror||The brutal suicide attack outside the airport in Kabul that killed nearly 100 people and injured many more on Thursday has dispelled the impression that the Taliban was firmly in control of Afghanistan. It has also sparked renewed concerns about the war-torn country again becoming a staging ground for jihadi elements of various hues. The attack, for which the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) has claimed responsibility, was not entirely unexpected. It came after repeated warnings over the past few days from countries such as the United States (US) and the United Kingdom about a possible terrorist assault on the airport by the very same group.With one devastating attack, the IS-K has signalled that it is still in the game in Afghanistan and retains the capability to strike, almost at will, in urban centres. Soon after the Taliban’s triumphant march into Kabul on August 15 was celebrated by al-Qaeda and sundry terrorist groups around the world, the IS had dismissed the victory as a takeover coordinated by the US in line with the controversial peace deal that was signed by the Taliban and the Donald Trump administration in February 2020. The IS’s newsletter even derisively referred to the Taliban as “Mullah Bradley” or an American proxy.Also Read | Afghanistan’s anarchic jihadist landscapeWestern powers had wrongly conflated the IS-K’s inability to hold territory in Nangarhar and Kunar provinces in eastern Afghanistan, and the surrender of hundreds of its fighters in late 2019, as a reflection of its diminished capabilities. The group continued carrying out deadly terror attacks in Afghanistan’s cities, including a daring jailbreak in Jalalabad in August last year and a suicide bombing outside a girls’ school in a Shia neighbourhood of Kabul in May. Afghan experts believe the IS-K recruited more fighters for an urban terrorism campaign after it became convinced last year that it would only be a matter of time before the Taliban came to power. Its latest assault poses significant challenges for the Taliban, especially at a time when the group is attempting to prove that it is the genuine purveyor of an Islamic system based on Shariah, while attempting to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the world community by providing governance to the Afghan people. There is little evidence to suggest the current crop of Taliban leaders can govern effectively, and a running battle with the IS-K will only add to the misery of the Afghan people struggling to emerge from a tragic 20-year war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-islamic-state-strikes-terror-101630068210109.html
