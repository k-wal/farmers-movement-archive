Those students who feel they could have done better if they had appeared for the final year exams, they will be given a chance when the situation normalises,” he said.The state government is more keen to ensure that the academic year starts on time in June than re-opening schools.“Schools in rural areas where there isno pandemic spread can start whereas in cities online education can be given priority,” he said.The CM also said that doorstep distribution of newspapers will be allowed from June 7.Delivery of newspapers was banned in Mumbai and Pune.He further said the state government’s consistent focus since the last two months has been on curbing the pandemic.“Ramping up the number of laboratories and testing will be priority,” he said, adding that 28,000 of 65,000 COVID-19 patients in the state have recovered and discharged.Maharashtra’s COVID-19 case count as on May 31 stands at 67,655 with 2,286 deaths, mainly fuelled by Mumbai’s case count of 39,686 and 1,279 fatalities, which is the highest in the country.Thackeray listed health and education as the priority areas for his government, saying the Covid-19 pandemic has also taught positive lessons.Taking a swipe at the Opposition, the CM said he felt bad that attempts are being made to “malign” the image of the state.Referring to speculations about a survival threat to his tripartite government, Thackeray, who heads the Shiv Sena, said he wasn’t worried since people are backing the ruling dispensation.Meanwhile, he also appealed to fishermen to not venture into the Arabian sea following the Met department’s observation of a brewing cyclonic storm that could hit the coasts of Maharashtra and Gujarat by June 3.“People on the west coast should remain alert.Administration is fully geared up to tackle any eventuality,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-cm-uddhav-thackeray-advises-caution-as-state-relaxes-more-curbs/story-pZ8Cg6d2HRtCusMLUgki3O.html
31-05-2020||Delhi||DMA writes to Delhi govt to issue protocols and appoint nodal officer for better coordination||The Delhi Medical Association (DMA) has written to the Delhi government demanding the appointment of a nodal officer, and standard protocols to ensure coordination between the government and the 117 private nursing homes and hospitals that were roped in to treat Covid-19 patients.The government had last week ordered these institutes with a minimum bed capacity of 50 to reserve 20% of beds for Covid-19 patients and 70 had complied, according to an official. In the letter to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on May 26, DMA’s Nursing Homes and Medical Establishment Forum (NH and MEF) wing wrote that serious Covid-19 cases admitted in nursing homes will need to be treated in tertiary care centres.Dr. Ajay Bedi, honorary secretary of DMA’s NH and MEF wing, said, “In such a case, the patient needs to be shifted and for this there has to be a nodal officer whom we can call. This officer should be responsible for arranging the bed for the transfer to higher tertiary care facilities and transportation in case of death.”They also demanded that the doctors and paramedical staff at these facilities be covered under the state government’s insurance scheme for healthcare workers. The DMA highlighted the difficulty in segregating Covid and non-Covid patients, and also staff shortage in such institutions.“We are as it is functioning only with just over half our staff strength as the rest live far away and cannot report for duty without public transport. For Covid-19, we will have to keep dedicated staff as we will have to reserve 24 beds. We don’t know how we will manage it,” said the medical director of a 120-bedded hospital in West Delhi, requesting anonymity.Many of the designated Covid-19 hospitals in the private sector are on the brink of reaching capacity. The number of cases have been increasing in the city in the last few days, with over 1,000 new cases being reported for four days in a row on Sunday. The Association of Healthcare Providers (India) -- which has at least 10,000 member hospitals across the country -- had also raised concerns over several smaller medical institutions finding it difficult to conform to the strict guidelines issued in the matter by the Delhi government. “It is difficult for smaller hospitals to completely separate the Covid and non-Covid areas, have separate entrances or stringently implement the standard operating procedures by the health ministry to prevent the spread of the infection,” said Giridhar Gyani, director-general, Association of Healthcare Providers (India). “We suggest that the government could designate two or three hospitals entirely in each district to get the same number of beds.”Dr. PK Bhardwaj, secretary, Delhi Voluntary Hospital Forum, an association of major hospitals in the city, said: “Many hospitals that were constructed more than 10 years ago do not have planned isolation areas. This means that the air conditioning system and the gas pipeline is shared throughout the hospital. Now, this pipeline is also used for suction of fluids that go into a central repository, this can lead to further spread of the infection within the hospitals.”When contacted, a senior Delhi government official aware of the development said, “The government is working on protocols for these hospitals. It will have details about what kind of arrangements have to be made at these hospitals. We are making all the possible arrangements to ensure people don’t face any kind of difficulty.”On designating hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients, another senior government official said, “We would have preferred to designate full hospitals en-bloc to treat the rising cases, but hospitals did not come forward for that.”Dr. Jugal Kishore, head of the department community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said, “This is the time when all medical institutions should pitch-in. As far as appointing a nodal officer is concerned, the government should appoint area-wise nodal officers for better coordination between various hospitals. The number of ventilator-beds available should be accessible to all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dma-writes-to-delhi-govt-to-issue-protocols-and-appoint-nodal-officer-for-better-coordination/story-lIIB5ibhkC0jsRV6rqnZ8M.html
31-05-2020||Mumbai||Air India pilots’ body claims crew harassed on Delhi-Moscow flight||Air India’s narrow-body pilot wing- Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA) on Sunday wrote to its management complaining of harassment to its crew on Saturday saying they would not operate any other flights than the ones carrying essentials (cargo) if there’s a repeat of the same behaviour with the crew. On Saturday, a Delhi-Moscow flight had to return to Delhi after one of their cockpit crews was found positive Covid-19.The union stated that the crew on the Delhi-Moscow flight on May 30 had a “traumatic day” after one of the pilots tested positive for Covid-19, following which, the rest of the crew were made to wait the entire day without food or refreshments. However, Air India has refused to comment on the issue.ICPA alleged that health officials at Delhi airport failed to comply with government orders and the protocol to be followed before and after flight for Covid testing, for crew operating Vande Bharat Mission flights.The union also alleged that the crew were harassed by the health officials at the airport and were being forced to be taken to a government medical facility for seven days. ICPA said that it was only after the institutional quarantine facilities refused to accept the crew that they were allowed to go home to follow home-isolation for 14 days. The letter read, “...you will appreciate the fact that we are operating flights under Vande Bharat mission as “national duty” and the treatment meted to the operating crew is distasteful. We do not appreciate the treatment perpetrated to our crew and if history repeats itself, we will not be in a position to operate any flights other than the essential services.” The union also pointed out that the post-flight Covid-19 testing was not carried out and the crew were not accommodated in a hotel as per the protocol. The letter stated, “...It can be construed as a lack of coordination between Air India, ministry of home affairs (MHA), Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and health officials at the airport.”The ICPA mentioned about the circular issued by the ministry of health and family welfare and DGCA circulars (dated 23 March 2020), that stated, “If a laboratory positive case of Covid-19 is found in a flight, the entire crew has to be de-rostered for minimum 14 days. The crew need to follow home-isolation during the time in their own country.” The pilot’s body sought clarification on the protocol to be followed by their colleagues when a positive case of Covid is found on a domestic flight and when a positive case is found on a flight for Vande Bharat mission. ICPA also asked to clarify the kind of flight operations that will qualify a set of crew, for the minimum 14 days home isolation after their de-rostering.Lastly, the pilot’s body also asked to clarify if the MHA standard operating procedure (SOP) laid down for movement of Indian nationals stranded outside the country requiring RT-PCR test for passengers, was being followed. 50 flights operated to and from Mumbai on SundayChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) saw a total of 50 scheduled flights which include 25 departures and 25 arrivals on Sunday. CSMIA connected to 14 sectors which were operated by five airlines. CSMIA catered to a total of 5,535 passengers which include 4,203 passengers at departures and 1,332 at arrivals. The highest passenger load capacity was seen on the Patna route departing out of CSMIA. The first flight departed to Kolkata at 6:0am while the first flight arrived at 8:10am from Lucknow which was operated by SpiceJet and IndiGo, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/air-india-pilots-body-claims-crew-harassed-on-delhi-moscow-flight/story-fLDVbf1NkKLrCFtdQX18wO.html
31-05-2020||Delhi||No respite for poor students with no smartphones, Internet||Malkeet Singh’s 12-year-old son, a Class 6 student at a private school in west Delhi, is worried ever since his school switched to online lessons and tests following the Covid-19 lockdown. As no one in his family owned a smartphone, he was unable to appear for the seven tests conducted by his school recently.“We had repeatedly conveyed our problem to the class teacher and the school but to no avail,” said Singh, a contractual driver who lost his job during the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19. Singh’s children are among the several hundred students admitted under the Economically Weaker Section quota in the 1,700 private schools in the capital every year and are entitled to free education. Parents with an annual income of less than ₹1 lakh can seek admission under the EWS quota.However, the switch from classroom teaching to online education has left them in the lurch.Earlier this month, Hindustan Times had reported that students enrolled in private schools under the Economically Weaker Section quota are struggling to attend online classes due to the lack of devices and high-speed Internet and have been unable to take their exams as well. A plea in this regard was also filed in the Delhi High Court by the NGO Justice For All which contended that over 50,000 such students would be affected by the decision of private schools to conduct online education.“Schools can make temporary provisions for students who are not able to access online education. Instead, they have been ignoring these children who are unable to catch up due to lack of access to devices or the Internet. An alternative mechanism should be arranged for such students so that their academic year is not under threat,” said advocate Shikha Sharma, secretary of Justice for All.Despite the Delhi government’s submission in the ongoing case—which said that under the Right to Education Act, schools should provide equipment if such children were unable to access online education—little has changed on the ground.Laxman, a resident of Nangloi who works as a carpenter, said that his family had no means of getting a smartphone with his meagre means. The family is currently struggling to ensure that their son finishes his holiday homework on time.“My son, who studies in Class 3, had his tests earlier this month. Since we have no high-end smartphone or computer, we had to borrow phones from our relatives or neighbours and all his submissions were delayed. While formulating plans of how to conduct studies during this pandemic, schools and authorities should think of alternative measures for families like ours as well,” he said.Families with multiple children also had their own share of struggles. “There is just one phone in the house and I have three children. They have all received tons of homework and we don’t know how to help them all. There are constant fights between them to attend classes,” Rakesh Thakur, a Kalyanpuri resident, whose children study in classes 5, 3, and 2, said.SK Bhattacharya, the president of Action Committee of Unaided Recognized Private Schools, said it wasn’t practically feasible for private schools to bear the additional burden of providing smartphones and laptops to children and wait for the reimbursement from the Centre.“We haven’t received any written complaint from EWS students on the matter so far. I don’t think there is anyone in Delhi who does not own a smartphone. Besides, they should also look at what is happening in government schools. Why this targeting of private schools? If they are so sympathetic to the cause, they should distribute laptops among all such students,” he said.“Government schools are conducting online classes for classes 9 to 12, which is outside the ambit of the Right to Education Act. Private schools are conducting online classes for everyone, including junior-level classes up to Class 8. The RTE Act clearly mandates that the educational material has to be provided by schools. So while during regular teaching, the books and materials were provided by private schools, the necessities of online education should also be provided by them,” a senior official from the Directorate of Education said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-respite-for-poor-students-with-no-smartphones-internet/story-TBTwKW5X2GN5elhceReGSK.html
31-05-2020||Mumbai||Schools in rural, remote areas can open others can begin online classes: CM||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday directed the education department to begin the academic year from June by opening schools physically in remote and rural areas and virtually in the rest of the state.The schools in rural and remote areas will function with maintaining social distancing norms while in others the government hopes to start online education.The school education department is preparing a standard operation procedure (SOP) for the new academic year, tapping all possibilities of offline and online education through pre-loaded tablets, TV and radio channels, among others. Thackeray held a video conference with education ministers, officials, experts from the field and legislators representing teachers on Sunday, to discuss the options to begin the academic year. The CM said that the academic year should not be wasted and the state should lead the way by setting an example of tiding over the difficulties arising out of the pandemic. The CM was also told that online education could hit a hurdle as only 3.3% of the total 2.30 crore households have computers. However, 70% of households have TV sets, which can be used as a medium of instruction. This is one of the options that the government is keen to tap.“The education department also expressed fear of girls dropping out due to the rising unemployment and the cut in the spending capacity of households. In such a scenario, opening schools is important,” said an official from the education department. “Some of the private schools have already started their academic year online. The problem lies for students in rural areas, where online platforms do not work. Thus, we have decided to open the schools in remote and rural areas. We will have another meeting in the next three-four days to decide the modalities on opening the schools,” said Omprakash Babarao Kadu, minister of state, school education.School education minister Varsha Gaikwad said that her department is preparing a statement of purpose (SOP) for the new academic year in consultation with experts from the education sector. Vandana Krishna, additional chief secretary of the department, said that Google has offered to provide their Classroom platform free of cost. However, principals said that the government should wait at least till July to reopen schools. “It seems like a hasty decision to start schools in June irrespective of the zones that they are in. Even in green zones, the risk still remains as opening borders has facilitated free travel of people across regions. Children should not be put at risk just because we want to start schools,” said Prashant Redij, principal, Hilda Castelino High School in Kandivli. “While online learning in places like Mumbai can carry on, we don’t know how many students will be able to access it considering the availability of devices,” he added. Ghanshyam Sonar, convenor, All India RTE Forum, said that the penetration of internet is low in the state, a factor that needs to be looked at before proposing online education. “Most students in the state do not have access to technology and even when they do, internet connectivity is an issue. Teaching has to focus on the learning outcome of students. Merely one-directional videos cannot be called teaching,” said Sonar. As per the data obtained by the state education department , only about 27% households have smartphone or electronic devices. Kapil Patil, member of legislative Council from teachers constituency, attended the meeting. He said that Thackeray has assured to withdraw all teachers engaged in non-teaching activities. “Of the 5.5 lakh teachers employed in government and aided schools, nearly 10% are engaged in non-teaching activities. The CM said that the government is coming out with a strict notification banning authorities from engaging teachers in non-teaching activities. This will help state in availing more teachers imparting education, online or offline,” he said.Parents said that they would not prefer sending their children even if schools start from June. “Most parents will not send their children to school for the next few months irrespective of the situation because there is a lot of fear. Especially in cities like Mumbai and Pune, no attempt should be made to start schools because the turnout would anyway be low,” said Alka Gade, a city-based parent. On May 11, HT reported a survey conducted by ParentCircle, an online forum, which stated 54% parents from the city have said that they would not send their children to school at least for a month after they reopen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/schools-in-rural-remote-areas-can-open-others-can-begin-online-classes-cm/story-bKAY5qkab5lJ2dXReXS1wK.html

He was 62. He was involved in several projects related to riverfront development, public spaces, buildings across India.Remembering his contribution to Delhi’s landscape, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia tweeted, “The spaces he created have become architectural landmarks for our city brought alive by his imaginative design. RIP.”According to Sachdeva’s friends, he wasn’t keeping well for the past few months and was admitted to a hospital recently for treatment. He is survived by his wife, son and daughter.AGK Menon, his friend and noted urban designer, remembered him as an innovative, humanistic designer who focused on “indigenous quality of design” in his work.“He tried to use the local construction techniques, indigenous designs in his work to create something extraordinary. This you will find in most of his work,” Menon said.Dilli Haat, Menon said, is one of his most important works. “It is an inclusive public space, which has been designed over a Nullah. The place is contemporary yet traditional,” said Menon.For the past few years, he was working on the Delhi government’s ambitious Chandni Chowk redevelopment project, work on which started in December 2018 after much delay.The project was close to him as it involved pedestrianisation of one of Delhi’s most congested markets without disturbing its heritage. The biggest challenge in the project was to get all the stakeholders to agree to the design.Nitin Panigrahi, deputy general manager of Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), tweeted, “PradeepSachdeva ji shall be remembered for his passion for inclusive urbanism & architectural heritage revitalisation Redevelopment Project of #ChandniChowk may inspire policy makers to recognise his impetus to make public streets inclusive for all #pedestrian or #cyclist alike and urban designer renowned.”He was also the main consultant for the Jama Masjid Precinct redevelopment project, work on which is yet to start.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/architect-who-designed-dilli-haat-garden-of-five-senses-dead/story-XTnEJMgp4Nmor4NnX8lGyI.html
31-05-2020||Delhi||Firing at Republican Party of India leader’s farmhouse, guard injured||An unidentified man on Sunday shot at a 50-year-old security guard deployed at the farmhouse of a leader of the Republican Party of India’s (RPI) in outer Delhi’s Nihal Vihar, police said. The security guard suffered bullet injuries on his leg, they said adding that a case has been registered in the matter. According to the police, the suspect first approached the guard, Hari Nath, asking him about the whereabouts of the RPI leader Mohammad Shakeel Saifi. When the guard asked the suspect to contact his employer on his mobile phone, the suspect fired two rounds at him.Deputy commissioner of police (Outer) A Koan said that Nath suffered bullet injuries in his legs and was shifted to Balaji Action Hospital. “A case of attempt to murder with sections 25/27 of the arms act has been registered at the Nihal Vihar police station and the investigation is on ion the matter,” the DCP added.A police officer associated with the investigation, on the condition of anonymity, said that Saifi—the national president of the minority cell of RPI— was at his farmhouse with his family when the firing took place around 9 am. RPI is led by Ramdas Athawale, the Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment.Saifi was not available for a comment as multiple calls and text messages sent on his cellphone remained unanswered.The officer said the injured security guard told the police that he was on duty alone when someone knocked at the farmhouse’s main gate. The guard opened the gate to find a man wearing a mask. “The man asked the guard about Saifi. Nath responded asking him to call Saifi if he wanted to meet him. At this, the man pulled out a pistol and fired two shots. The attacker fled as Nath screamed for help,” the officer said.The police said they were informed about the incident around 9.15 am following which a team rushed to the spot immediately. “The CCTV camera installed near the crime scene at Saifi’s farmhouse was defunct. We are scanning CCTV cameras in the neighbourhood to ascertain the suspect’s identity,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/firing-at-republican-party-of-india-leader-s-farmhouse-guard-injured/story-3Z6s5vxCikrjvrgx687QsL.html
31-05-2020||City||Migrant workers struggle to feed families, stare at unpaid rents||Navi Mumbai Migrant workers, who left their hometowns hoping for a better life in the city, have been forced by the coronavirus lockdown to stare at an uncertain future. Belapur-based Sajan Jha, 35, worked at a restaurant as a cashier until it shut down due to the lockdown. Jha lives with his wife and two daughters, one aged three years and another nine months. He had returned with his family from Darbhanga in Bihar only a few weeks before the lockdown. “One day, a local Gurudwara provided us food, it lasted for a while, another time an NGO provided milk powder for my daughter. We have almost run out of money and I am mainly worried for milk for my young daughter,” said Jha.Jha then sent out a message to a friend seeking ration for his family and 14 others in his area, all of whom have been struggling to make ends meet. The message found its way to Navi Mumbai police on Sunday and within hours, the police provided rations to the families.“I cannot put food on my plate while my neighbour starves. We are worried about the future. We will face hunger for a while but will not leave Mumbai. We will not get work back home,” Jha said.Manish Singh, 36, is also on the same boat. Singh worked at a restaurant and only a few days before the lockdown was set to start his own small canteen. His family lives in Uttarakhand and he tried to return on the Shramik Special train, but his name wasn’t listed.Singh said he will wait it out until lockdown is over before returning home.“The canteen may not start. I will find something in the village. In hindsight, I think it is okay to stay hungry for some time rather than die like animals trying to get back home. When I get ration and cook for myself, I share it with someone needy in the area,” he said Ravindra Prasad, 40, and his wife stay with their nine-year-old twins – a boy and a girl - in Belapur on rent. For three months, Prasad has not paid his monthly rent. The landlord has not come asking for money but Prasad knows he will have to arrange the money soon.He used to run a snacks cart and would earn Rs 12,000 per month. After the cart was shut, Prasad does not know what the future holds except his option to return to Bihar.“I will have to return home with my family. I will work at a farm and earn whatever little I can. We are daily wage workers, we cannot sit at home for six months and eat peacefully,” said Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrant-workers-struggle-to-feed-families-stare-at-unpaid-rents/story-NzEAq4gkhvrmbzT67yFZEL.html
31-05-2020||City||Lineman electrocuted; four booked for negligence||Gurugram: Four days after he joined work, a 34-year-old man, who worked as a lineman for a private company, was allegedly electrocuted while repairing a technical fault at a power cable in Kanhai village on Friday. The police said they have booked four people from the private company where he worked for negligence on the complaint of the victim’s brother. According to the police, the incident was reported on Friday around 4.30pm when the victim, Yashvir, had gone to repair the power cable. The police said while repairing the line, he suffered a voltage shock when he was perched on the top of a tower at a height of about 12 metres and collapsed. Some colleagues and passersby rushed him to a private hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival, said the police.The police said the discom had given the contract for repairing the power line to the private company where the victim worked.His brother, Santram, alleged that his brother was not provided adequate safety gear, which led to his death. “On March 23, he had returned to our native house in Panipat. During the entire lockdown period, he was staying at home in the absence of work. He had joined work four days ago. Had his employers provided him with safety gear, he would have survived,” said Santram.Santram also alleged that his brother was threatened to resume work during the lockdown or face termination. “He was called to work after completing his shift and threatened with non-payment of salary if he refused to work,” he said.A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said that police had initiated a probe and no persons have been arrested so far. A case was registered against the four accused persons under sections 304-A (causing death by negligence) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) at Sector 40 police station on Sunday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lineman-electrocuted-four-booked-for-negligence/story-j07O2gwzRxXyuWneYMMMHN.html

Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said that shortcomings in hospitals or in sample-taking have been taken care of and adequate facilities are now available to take care of city residents.Khatri said that the majority of patients are asymptomatic and don’t need hospitalisation or serious medical care. “Such patients can recuperate in isolation centres or at their homes and need to be observed by healthcare professionals from time to time,” he said, adding that this was why residents didn’t need to worry.The deputy commissioner also said that a standard operating procedure for Covid-19 management would be issued soon to make people aware about what to do for patients in home isolation, what action to take in case a person living in the neighbourhood was reported positive and what kind of precautions people living in containment zones must take. Guidelines would also make it clear when testing has to be taken and when it would be appropriate to get admitted into a hospital.Additionally, the district administration also said that residents can seek help via the helpline number 1950, which is operational 24X7. Officials also said that till date over one lakh persons have called the helpline and sought help or information from authorities pertaining to complaint resolution, online movement passes, registration of migrant and distribution of food and apart from matters has been done.Additional commissioner Aprajita said that 40 operators were available 24 hours to attend to calls from city residents pertaining to various issues.

31-05-2020||City||Gurugram’s Covid-19 tally almost doubles in three days||Gurugram:The district registered 97 new Covid-19 patients on Sunday, taking the tally of positive cases to 774, health officials said. With this, the district now accounts for a whopping 37% of all Covid-19 cases in Haryana, as per the state health department’s bulletin.The state reported a total of 2,091 positive cases till Sunday evening.According to the officials, Gurugram’s tally of positive cases has almost doubled in just three days, with 369 new Covid-19 cases recorded since May 28 when the tally stood at 405. Notably, it took more than two months for the district to record its first 350 cases, the officials said. Till May 27, 337 people were found positive for the virus. The health officials attributed the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases in the district mainly to relaxation in lockdown restrictions. Currently, the district has 487 active cases, they said.This trend, experts say, is worrying, especially since the district’s test positivity rate (TPR) -- the ratio of positive cases to samples tested -- is also on the rise. According to official figures, Gurugram’s TPR soared from 10% on May 27 to 24% on May 28, and further climbed up to 53% on May 29. Meanwhile, the number of new tests being conducted daily has not significantly increased.For example, on May 22, when 353 new samples were tested from Gurugram, the district recorded just 11 new Covid-19 cases, resulting in a TPR of 3%. However, on May 28, 286 new samples from the district were tested, of which 68 were found positive, with a TPR of 24%. On May 30, more than half of the 350 new samples tested came back positive.“An increasing test positivity rate is not necessarily a cause for alarm, as it indicates that surveillance systems are working effectively. However, given that the number of daily tests being conducted has not significantly improved, it could mean that background prevalence of the disease in the population at large is quite high,” said Rajesh Kumar, epidemiologist and former professor of community medicine at PGIMER, Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-s-covid-19-tally-almost-doubles-in-three-days/story-KMypaZ2R4zbLhsdlSjKMZO.html
31-05-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Offices reopening, day cares shut, parents face a difficult choice||With the lockdown being eased and the city’s offices slowly sputtering back to life, working couples are faced with a difficult choice — how to maintain a healthy work-life balance, with day care centres in the city continuing to stay shut. While some of them are ensuring that one partner stays back home, others are planning to hire full domestic helps who can stay at home with the child.Smita Pal, the mother of a four-year-old, said she has been working from home since the lockdown began. Now, while her husband has started going to office, she expects her office routine to resume soon. With day care centres closed due to restrictions, she and her husband are under pressure to find a solution.“My son goes to school and then to a day-care facility normally. But, with daycare centres shut, we are not sure how we will manage, once my office starts operations. We are a nuclear family and for the past two weeks, we have been pondering over the choices that we have before us. It will be a huge challenge for us,” said Pal, who has started looking out for a 12-hour domestic help, who could possibly stay at home in her absence. “We opted for day care centres earlier, since we didn’t prefer our child staying at home alone. With so many constraints now, however, we are being compelled to make difficult choices and have started looking out for a domestic help,” said Pal.Another parent, a mother of a 2-year-old, who did not wish to be named, said that she and her partner were stressed about leaving their child behind after offices resume full time work from June. “I am supposed to join work from the first week of June, while my husband is already working. Since it’s a new job, I’m not sure if I can opt for work from home. We don’t know what to do especially now that day care facilities are no longer an option,” she said. “Cases are rising, infections are rising, but at some point, one has to start going back to work. A possible solution is to hire a full-time domestic help. But there are concerns surrounding that too. We can’t be sure if someone is an asymptomatic carrier and taking such a risk might not pan out well,” she said.Shveta Sharma, who works in the hospitality sector, said that she was unsure about sending her five-year-old daughter to school or day care till at least December, since the number of Covid-19 cases were rising steadily. “It doesn’t feel safe. We don’t feel confident about sending our daughter away anywhere. Day cares are not an option and so far, we are trying to build a balance at home,” said Sharma. She said that employees at her company were free to work from home, but challenges remained. “One is required to meet clients for sales. We are not sure for how long can we afford to stay at home. Leaving children alone at home is not an option either. There is a lot of dilemma for all working parents,” said Sharma.Gurugram so far has registered 774 number of cases with three deaths due to Covid-19.Sharma added that support and clear communication from employers to employees was crucial in such periods. “Sometimes, organisations inform employees a week or two in advance when they make changes to their working guidelines during the pandemic. Adapting to such situations requires planning, especially for working families. We can’t simply leave our child behind with no one else to take care of them. Communicating in advance will allow parents to work on possible solutions,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-offices-reopening-day-cares-shut-parents-face-a-difficult-choice/story-mIxXJoB2O4lXRY3uJk8oYM.html
31-05-2020||Gurugram||Religious places suggest delayed opening, hotels ready to welcome guests||The district administration has decided to follow the revised night curfew timings issued by the ministry of home affairs — 9pm to 5am — and held a meeting with representatives of religious organisations, restaurants and hospitality industry for a phased exit from the lockdown.The meeting was chaired by divisional commissioner Ashok Sangwan while Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gururgam was also present.Officials said that decision to open religious places and business establishment would be taken on the basis of guidelines issued by the Union health ministry. The inputs from local stakeholders would help in phased exit from lockdown that was imposed on March 22.In the meeting, representatives of religious organisations asked the authorities to show restraint and delay the opening of the religious places in the city as there was a possibility of large crowds gathering at these places, which could further the spread of Covid-19. The representatives also said that it would be difficult to prevent people from visiting religious sites once they are open, as per a statement issued by the administration.“We have to exit the lockdown in a phased manner. The state government has to decide on the services which can be opened. In phase one, the guidelines will be applicable to three kinds of institutions that include hotels, religious places and shopping malls,” said Sangwan. He also asked the religious organisations to share plans for ensuring social distancing while performing prayers and other rituals at the places of worship.The representatives of the hotel and restaurant industry asked the district administration to allow the resumption of business as they are ready to follow all the safeguards prescribed by the government. They also said that there was no problem with regard to safety and security, as guests continue to stay in city hotels.In the meeting, Sangwan said that a standard operating procedure based on the guidelines of health ministry would be prepared. He said that hotel rooms should be properly sanitised and permission can be granted for room service, but serving walk-in customers won’t be allowed. He also called for adequate social distancing among guests and said that gyms and swimming pools in hotels would not be allowed to operate.In the case of restaurants, the divisional commissioner said that only take-away service would be allowed and that the permission for hosting guests would be given later, based on the emerging situation. The representatives asked the authorities to allow 50% guest capacity in restaurants.Authorities also said that suggestions in this regard can be emailed to dcgrg@hry.nic.in.Earlier in the day, a notification was issued by deputy commissioner changing the curfew timings. The order said that movement of any individual whomsoever for non-essential purposes shall henceforth remain restricted between 9pm and 5pm from May 31 to June 30. The order also said that persons above the age of 65 years, persons having co-morbidities suffering from chronic diseases, pregnant women and children below the age of 10 years shall avoid coming out in the open except in the case of a medical emergency or essential requirement as specified in the national directive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/religious-places-suggest-delayed-opening-hotels-ready-to-welcome-guests/story-MHfFSmeCoeY4at9tzGRADN.html
31-05-2020||City||Gurugram: Clear skies today; more rain expected after June 3||Gurugram: Heavy rains accompanied by squalls of winds and lighting lashed the city for the second time this week, resulting from a western disturbance (WD) passing through the national Capital region. According to forecasts of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the next few days are likely to see an increase in temperature by two to four degrees Celsius, while fresh showers are expected after June 3.The IMD had said Saturday that the combined influence of a WD and an east-west trough in lower tropospheric-levels would bring further rainfall to parts of NCR and the northern plains over the weekend. Gurugram received 5mm of rainfall until 8:30am Sunday morning, while gusty winds of speeds between 40 and 60kmph and heavy showers were observed late afternoon.Sunday’s maximum temperature, according to IMD data, was recorded at 33 degrees Celsius (down from 34.1 degrees Celsius the previous day), while minimum temperature was recorded at 20 degrees Celsius (down from 21 degrees Celsius the previous day).The impact of these weather events, officials said, is likely to diminish by tomorrow, bringing back clear skies to Gurugram. Going by the IMD’s seven-day forecast for the city, “partially cloudy skies” are expected to prevail till June 3, with maximum temperature not exceeding 37 degrees Celsius and minimum temperature not falling below 27 degrees Celsius.“But a fresh WD will manifest from the night of June 3. South-westerly winds blowing through Rajasthan due to the formation of a low pressure zone in the Arabian sea, and their movement via the Gujarat coast, would bring moisture to parts of north-west India and NCR,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, spokesperson, IMD.The combined effect of these two weather systems, according to the IMD, will lead to thunderstorms and light rain activity over NCR between June 3 and June 5, peaking on June 4. However, these conditions will also ensure that temperatures in the region remain low, with heat wave conditions not expected till at least June 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-clear-skies-today-more-rain-expected-after-june-3/story-EXJn3erqfQXbfQvJKSVwEN.html

Police officials said that 50 personnel will be deployed on the Sirhaul border starting Monday to control the traffic movement. However, the border with Delhi will remain sealed till fresh directions are issued by the state government, the officials said.As per the new plan, three different lanes will be set up for pass holders, essential services, and paramedical and sanitation workers. The extreme right lane will be for heavy vehicles and they will be checked 100 metres before the barricades. The initiative has been taken to ensure a smooth flow of traffic at the border, the officials said.Also, no motorist will be allowed to stand huddled during checking, the police said, adding that social distancing is very important to contain the Covid-19 spread.The Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Saturday had issued new guidelines for phased re-opening of areas outside the containment zones. In its new order, the MHA said that there shall be no restriction on inter-state and intra-state movement of persons and goods. But it also said that if a state, based on reasons of public health and its assessment of the situation, proposes to regulate the movement of persons, it will give wide publicity in advance regarding the restrictions to be placed on such movement, and the related procedures to be followed. The new guidelines will come into effect from June 1 and will be implemented until June 30.Muhammad Akil, commissioner of police, Gurugram, said that they have not de-sealed the border and are allowing people without passes in case of emergency. “With the growing number of cases connected to Delhi, we are taking extra precautionary measures to ensure the residents are safe and healthy. All essential services will be given separate lanes to pass the stretch, but checking will be conducted based on suspicious activity,” he said.The police said they are manning all the 11 borders to ensure no illegal activity or trafficking takes place.The inter-district borders with the state are open, said the officials, adding that the police personnel are deployed at all the borders connecting to other districts such as Faridabad, Nuh, Jhajjar, and Rewari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-border-with-delhi-to-remain-sealed-three-separate-lanes-for-checking/story-gx94wwB5OSeqc6DfwRskdO.html

31-05-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram police ask businesses to ensure visitors remove face mask once before entering premises||The police have directed all banks, jewellery stores and malls to ensure that customers remove their masks in front of CCTV cameras once they enter the premises so that their face can be captured.The police said the move was to ensure that no one takes advantage of a mask to rob or dupe anyone.An advisory was issued in this regard by state’s director-general of police (DGP) Manoj Yadava earlier this week to ensure that banks, jewellers, cash-dealing establishments and other companies are not targeted by miscreants and criminals.The police in every district in the state have directed the above-mentioned establishments to display the advisory, asking people to remove their masks while entering the premises.The state government had earlier made it mandatory for people to wear a face mask at work and public places in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Muhammad Akil, commissioner of police, said as people started commuting after the relaxations were announced, many complaints were received from people, alleging that incidents of snatching by people wearing masks were on the rise. “We have directed all the crime investigation units to ensure all the business establishments are well covered with CCTV cameras and they adhere to the newly released advisory,” he said.Akil said if any criminal activity takes place, the suspects can be apprehended with the help of the CCTV footage. “The miscreants, robbers or any criminal can take advantage of the current situation and escape through the vacant lanes or roads. People dealing in cash should take extra precautionary measures while carrying a large amount of cash while travelling or returning home,” he said.The deployment of police across the city has been increased and the crime unit staff has been deployed in market areas in plain clothes.“We are requesting people to inform the police control room(PCR) if they find any unusual activity or suspect anyone behind the mask. Immediate action will be taken and a team from the nearest police station/PCR will be sent to the spot,” said Akil.Each police station has also been given the task of taking care of the locked houses as thieves can take advantage of the situation as most of the migrant workers have returned to their home towns due to the Covid-19 pandemic, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-police-ask-businesses-to-ensure-visitors-remove-face-mask-once-before-entering-premises/story-uyAFtSv9c0xXPieoNkGSlN.html

The officials said that sectors 1 to 6 of Vaishali will be placed under the scheme and there will be strict restrictions on the movement of residents in the locality which has emerged as a Covid-19 hot spot.Till May 31, as many as 34 Covid-19 positive cases have been reported from Vaishali. The concept of sector scheme is already in place in Khoda and Loni, which have also witnessed the majority of cases in Ghaziabad. Under the sector scheme concept, teams of police, magistrates and health department officials take over an area for strict surveillance, sampling and contact tracing while ensuring restriction on movement of residents. Khoda locality was sealed on May 10, while Loni was put off bounds on May 27. “The sector scheme will be implemented in sectors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Vaishali locality. There will be restriction on movement of people in and out of the locality. Essential supplies like milk, vegetables, medicines and other necessary services will be provided by the administration. Apart from these, teams of health department, police and administrative officials will remain deployed at Vaishali till further order,” Aditya Prajapati, sub-divisional magistrate, said.Under the scheme, Vaishali has been divided into two zones comprising four sub-zones. Each sub-zone will be assigned with a team of officers who will check for violation of lockdown norms, and also take up legal action against violators.“Under this scheme, intensive sanitsation will be carried out in Vaishali, and we samples will be collected to find people who may have contracted the virus,” Prajapati added.Vaishali shares its borders with Delhi and hosts an estimated population of about 1.5 lakh people.“People from Vaishali will not be allowed to leave the locality, and they have been advised to stay at home. However, people engaged in essential services like police, doctors, paramedics and even media persons will be allowed to move out,” Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city) said.According to official records of the administration, Vaishali has five category 1 containment zones (areas where at least one case has emerged), and also two category 2 containment zones ( areas where more than one positive case has emerged).The district officials have been mulling over implementing the sector scheme in Vaishali and also inspected the area on Saturday.“We have decided that any area from where a large number of cases are reported will be subjected to the sector scheme in order to contain the spread of the Covid-19 infection,” said an officer from Ghaziabad district administration.32 NEW CASES REPORTED, TALLY AT 319The Ghaziabad district on Sunday recorded 32 new Covid-19 cases which took the district tally to 319 cases.

31-05-2020||City||Noida: Marked improvement in Okhla Bird Sanctuary habitat due to lockdown, say experts||Noida: Out of bounds for visitors and low on pollution since March, combined with favourable weather conditions have resulted in an improvement in habitat at the Okhla Bird Sanctuary, ecologists and officials of the forest department claim.According to the forest department, a pair of Common Cuckoo (Cocculus Conorus) birds called papiha was spotted at the sanctuary after a gap of two years.“A pair of Coculus Conorus was spotted on Sunday. It was after two years that the bird spotted in the sanctuary. This is the breeding season of terrestrial birds. Due to favourable weather, the sanctuary has seen good green cover. We take this spotting as a sign of improvement in habitat as well,” said Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.According to an ecologist from Wetland International who recently visited the sanctuary, the habitat has improved, with cleaner water in wetlands because of absence of industrial effluents in the river Yamuna during the lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. They also held negligible human disturbance as a bonus towards the improvement in the habitat, especially for the breeding season of terrestrial birds, allowing a better and freer environment to the birds to move about.“There is a clear visible improvement in the sanctuary. The chirping is loud and clear even from the entry gates, and the movement of birds, which were earlier often seen at good height or in the core part of the sanctuary is now visible uniformly. More and more species diversity was much evident in one swipe view,” said TK Roy, ecologist and Delhi state coordinator of Asia Waterbird Census, Wetland International.He further pointed out that favourable climatic conditions such as lesser heat, and occasional rains recently, also helped the sanctuary retain its greenery in the month of May when summer is at its peak usually, which is something he feels is favourable for the ongoing breeding season of the terrestrial birds.Stating that as the lockdown led to industries halting operations, the water quality of the wetland – that comprises a large part of the sanctuary – has shown visible improvement.“The foul odour of the water which was there before has almost gone. Earlier, the water here was almost blackish but this has improved as well,” Roy added.Earlier in February, the forest department had the water samples tested, which had revealed high oil and grease content, low oxygen levels and several faecal pollutants, leading to odour and darker colour in appearance. According to the forest department, while there are no sources of pollution within the bird sanctuary itself, it holds around 19 untreated drains in Delhi, discharging industrial and domestic effluents in the river, responsible for the polluted wetland.“We are yet to get water samples tested so as to understand how much the water quality has improved. However, there is a clear, visible improvement in the odour and the colour of the water. This has led to an overall habitat improvement of the sanctuary. Also, while migratory birds often leave by the end of March, there are still plenty of them staying back,” said Srivastava.Meanwhile, a total 70 species of birds, including summer migrants, were seen on Saturday itself at the sanctuary by experts.These species include summer migratory birds such as Common Hawk, Common Cuckoo, the Indian Golden Oriole, Blue-tailed Bee-eater, Streaked Weaver and resident terrestrial birds including the Indian Grey Hornbill, Brown-headed Barbet, Coppersmith Barbet, Yellow-footed Green Pigeon, Black Drongo, Green Bee-eater, Spotted Owlet, Grey Francolin, Yellow-bellied Prinia and Striated Grassbird.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-marked-improvement-in-okhla-bird-sanctuary-habitat-due-to-lockdown-say-experts/story-Tk3W8lOddyhEbWTbtmgdkN.html
31-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad gets two ventilators for non-Covid emergencies||A 70-year-old woman, who was rushed to MMG Hospital on Saturday after complaining of breathlessness, was denied admission and instead referred to Meerut Medical College. Reason: The hospital didn’t have any spare ventilators for non-Covid related emergencies.The incident on Sunday caught the attention of UP’s state minister for health and Ghaziabad MLA, Atul Garg, who immediately called a meeting of district health department officials and decided to dedicate two ventilators for non-Covid critical patients at MMG District Hospital.“The 70-year-old woman was brought to MMG Hospital on Saturday with complaints of breathlessness and had to be referred to Meerut as there were no spare ventilator available with us for regular patients at any government hospital. We already had five ventilators at Sanjay Nagar Hospital, which was recently dedicated for Covid patients since the hospital is now functioning as L2 category dedicated Covid hospital,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO).“Five more ventilators had arrived, of which three were given to Sanjay Nagar, while remaining two were sent to Agra. Since we had no non-Covid ventilators at any of our hospitals, the patient was referred to Meerut. She is a non-Covid patient as of now and her tests will be conducted,” CMO added.He said that after the patient was referred to Meerut, the minister called the CMO and hospital authorities of the two hospitals for a meeting.“The patient was from Kaila Bhatta and required ventilator support. Since it was not available, we had to send her to Meerut. I have called the CMO and the officials of the two hospitals. We will have non-Covid ventilators by Sunday evening,” Garg, said.Following the discussions, two ventilators were made available to MMG Hospital on Sunday evening.“During the meeting with the minister, it was decided that two ventilators available with us taht were to be sent to Agra, will now be given to MMG Hospital, which is a non-Covid government hospital,” the CMO said on Sunday evening.Under the instructions of the UP government, the state officials have come up with three-tier dedicated Covid hospitals — L1, L2 and L3 . The hospitals have also been provided with ventilators, oxygen supplies and other equipment to deal with Covid patients.“Now we have achieved the target of one lakh Covid beds as directed by the chief minister. The figure of Covid beds in L1, L2 and L3 category hospitals as of Sunday is 1,01, 236. We will now focus on quality improvement. Under this, we will focus on provision of equipment, medicines, medical teams, infra red thermometers, pulse oxymeters and ventilators for Covid-19 treatment,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP principal secretary (health).Meanwhile, the Ghaziabad authorities have planned to implement the lockdown guidelines issued by the UP government from June 1, but such relaxations will not be available in containment zones in the district.The officials said that majority of the containment zones, about 90% as per the list issued on May 30 with new definition, fall under the Ghaziabad city areas.According to a list prepared by the Ghaziabad district administration, the district has 65 identified category 1 containment zones, of which only seven are in rural areas.The list includes five category 1 containment zones in Vaishali, four in Vasundhara, six in Maharajpur and Jhandapur, 11 in Khoda, three in Indirapuram and seven in Vijay Nagar among others. All the areas are in the zones which have already categorised as Red Zones.The district has another set of seven, category 2 containment zones, where more than one case has been reported. The category 2 containment zones include six zones in urban areas and one in rural. These include two in Vaishali, one each in Indirapuram, Vasundhara and Jhandapur.The state government has also defined a new set of guidelines for sealing of residential highrises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-gets-two-ventilators-for-non-covid-emergencies/story-faxbqdZFihZBnlpW3GQByO.html

31-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Restrictions to ease from today but Delhi border to remain closed||Ghaziabad: After the Uttar Pradesh government issued guidelines for removing lockdown restrictions from June 1, the Ghaziabad district administration said Sunday the relaxations will be fully implemented. Ghaziabad, however, will not be opening any of its borders with Delhi.The state government had earlier in the day issued a set of guidelines, “Unlock 1.0”, for removing restrictions but specifically stated that the local administrations of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad districts will roll out their own directions in line with public interest.The guidelines from Lucknow came a day after the Union ministry of home affairs issued details of a three-phased plan which aimed at lifting stringent lockdown restrictions which were in place since March 25. The MHA’s plan also removes restrictions on inter-state and intra-state travel but Ghaziabad on Sunday decided against opening its borders with Delhi over concerns of rise in the number of coronavirus (Covid-19) infections.The district shares its borders with Delhi at UP-Gate, Kaushambi-Anand Vihar, Seemapuri and Loni areas.“We have decided to adopt all guidelines issued by the UP state government but have decided against opening our borders with Delhi till further instructions. Entry at the borders will be restricted in line with the earlier directions issued by the district administration. Apart from that, all guidelines issued by the UP government will be put in place from June 1,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.Travel restrictions at the border have been in place since April 20 when the district magistrate had issued orders prohibiting travel, other than for essential and emergency services, between Ghaziabad and Delhi. The officials had attributed the decision to the rising number of Covid-19 cases due to cross border travel.Renewed directions were issued on May 25 citing the same reasons and specific categories of commuters were allowed on the basis of their identification cards or valid passes/authorisation letters.“In areas of the national Capital region like Noida and Ghaziabad, the local administration along with police and health officials, will issue directions keeping in mind public interest. Whatever restrictions are to be put in place, including issuance of passes, etc., will be decided by the local administration,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).In its guidelines issued Sunday, Lucknow stated that all industrial activities can open up but only those outside containment zones, that too with precautions.“All industrial activities have been directed to start. If there are night shifts then there should be proper arrangement of buses, etc. All district magistrates have been directed to hold discussions with traders’ associations and chalk out plans to open up markets. All markets will open from 9am to 9pm and this has been planned so that there is no large gathering at any one point of time,” Awasthi added.Till May 31, shops in the 34 different markets in Ghaziabad were allowed to open on alternate days from 10am to 5pm. Fruit and vegetable markets are also allowed to open for retailing from 8am to 8pm. The same will now be allowed to open only till 2pm from Monday. “We have devided that earlier directions about opening of markets will be in place till further orders,” the Ghaziabad district magistrate said.“There will still be restrictions on opening of weekly markets in urban areas. Street vendors can open up but only in open areas. Saloons and beauty parlours, etc., will be allowed to open but will be directed to maintain social distancing and use of face masks, one-time use of cloth and towel, and preferably use disposable items,” Awasthi said.He added that taxis, cabs, three-wheelers, autos and e-rickshaws will be allowed to ply but with defined seating capacity.“Only two persons are allowed on two-wheelers but both should be wearing helmets and masks. The UP State Road Transport Corporation buses, stage-carriages, contract buses and city buses will resume operations within the state as per seating capacity. If they don’t follow norms, action will be taken up under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles’ Act as well as the Disaster Management Act,” Awasthi added.Officials said that parks will also be allowed to open from 5am to 8am and 5pm to 8pm each day while sports complexes and stadiums will open without spectators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-restrictions-to-ease-from-today-but-delhi-border-to-remain-closed/story-TC493f2vDPpzH43Tu0VIKP.html

The parole was extended to allow him to attend to his ailing wife. However, on May 22 he was directed by the bench to surrender at the Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai as he was unable to travel to Nagpur due to the lockdown.

At present, with 90% students off-campus due to the lockdown, it has once again attracted wildlife.A resident of the campus on Sunday reported a leopard crossing her path at 6:45pm while she was walking her dog. “The leopard crossed my path near the system controls building. A guard had to chase the leopard away and it coolly walked into the woods,” said Falguni Banerjee Naha, PRO of the institute. She added that the leopard was later also spotted from the terrace of another building the same day.In the last week of April, residents of the campus reported two sightings of leopards with the college administration within 24 hours this week. The IIT-B campus is spread over 550 acres bordering the Sanjay Gandhi National Park and this has its pros and cons. While students of the institute pride themselves on living so close to nature that sighting deer, various species of birds and cattle, among other animals is a common feature, many have also complained about uninvited and unpleasant guests.While dog attacks on staff and students, as well as cattle being found inside hostel rooms and classrooms are common, there have also been instances when leopards have entered labs on campus and in another case, a wild bull had attacked a student as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-b-resident-spots-leopard-on-campus/story-NQajita9YIsVqVSDd15dtL.html

31-05-2020||City||Time that govts crack down on profiteering in the name of Covid-19||New Delhi: A retired teacher, Arvind’s dental treatment at a neighbourhood private clinic had remained incomplete and pending for the last two months because of the sudden lockdown. So following relaxation in the lockdown rules, he visited his dentist to get the job completed. This time, his bill included two additional, unexpected items that he was not aware of: Rs 1200 for a pair of shoe covers, a pair of gloves, a head cover and a disposable gown and Rs 1500 for the Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) worn by the doctor. If you look at the price of disposable gloves, shoe cover, head cover and the gown online, the four items would not have cost the dentist more than Rs 250, so there was a neat profit of Rs 950 on them alone. What he was charging for the PPE too was also quite high. The PPE consists of goggles, face shield, mask (N-95 or surgical), gloves, overall gown, head cover and shoe cover. Their prices have come down since the beginning of the Covid crisis and according to the price list issued by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in the beginning of May, for example, it ranged between Rs 812 (with N95 mask) and Rs 660 (with three-ply mask). Even if the dentist had paid Rs 1,000 for it, he is still making a profit of Rs 500. When you are already charging for the dental services, why should you make a profit on the PPEs? That’s unscrupulous manipulation of the situation.But these profit margins pale into insignificance when you see the charges imposed in the name of Covid-19 by some of the private hospitals around the country -- the many complaints and tweets by anguished consumers bear testimony to the crass commercialisation and undue exploitation of consumers in these highly difficult times. A Kolkata resident, for example, said he was charged Rs 12,000 towards PPEs (for four people) and Rs 2,000 for masks (for four persons) during a 20 hour stay at a private hospital for treatment of vertigo. A Pune resident complained that he was asked to pay as much as Rs 9,000 per PPE or a total of Rs 27,000 per day for three PPEs. A Delhi resident said he was charged Rs 18,000 towards PPE for three days’ stay at a private hospital for a non-covid treatment. Many consumers say that they are now most worried about going to a hospital --- even if it is for a non-covid treatment, because of the exorbitant rates charged by hospitals for PPEs and such other Covid-related expenses. Hospitals say that their staff have to wear the PPE even while treating non-Covid patients, particularly because many of the patients might be asymptomatic, but carriers of the virus. That’s fair enough, but what is certainly not fair is the abuse of the situation to earn extra profits, at the cost of the consumer.In fact health insurance companies are also crying foul over the exorbitant rates charged by private hospitals vis-a-vis Covid-19, both in non-Covid as well as Covid cases, particularly the steep rates on PPEs and some related charges. Insurers point out that if, for example, there are ten patients in a unit, the cost of the PPE should be divided among them all. After all, nurses and doctors on duty will wear the same PPE and see all of them. It is therefore incorrect to charge each patient, the full cost of PPE. Insurers are also refusing to pay some of these charges, leaving even those with health insurance, in a deep crisis.It’s time that state governments came to the rescue of consumers and cracked down on private hospitals and clinics using Covid-19 to make a fast buck. There are enough laws in their armoury to do that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/time-that-govts-crack-down-on-profiteering-in-the-name-of-covid-19/story-P9mOUOx8kRyvhKQOgBNV3L.html

The new set of relaxations also permit re-opening of hotels, restaurants and other hospitality services apart from shopping malls from that day onwards for all areas outside the containment zones.In the list of areas that remain inaccessible in this stage of lockdown, the state government has decided to keep schools, colleges, training and coaching institutions shut till the end of June. Cinema halls, gyms, metro rail, bars and auditoriums, public swimming pools, international air travel of passengers will also be barred for usage across the state. In the containment zones, only essential services would be permitted. As for curfew, Karnataka government has followed Centre’s footsteps and decided to observe the shutdown from 9 pm to 5 am daily with all non-essential movement restricted.The state is continuing with protective measures from the previous lockdown, which include wearing masks, maintaining social distance, banning consumption of tobacco and liquor in public places, limiting only 50 people in marriage and fine on spitting in public places. The state government’s order also mentions screening and hygiene, frequent sanitisation, staggering of work hours and encouraging work from home.Even as the government announced these new rules, the state grappled to contain the count of Covid-19 affected as it registered the highest ever single day jump in new cases. 299 new Covid-19 positive cases have been registered on Sunday, taking the tally to 3,221 cases which includes 1,218 discharged persons and 51 deaths.The large spike was primarily attributed to migrants in the state returning from Maharashtra with 90 per cent of the new cases having travel history to the neighbouring state. Yadgiri, Raichuru, Mandya, Bidar and Hassana continued to account for the bulk of new cases as well as the total number of cases in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-extends-lockdown-till-june-30-records-highest-surge-in-cases-in-a-day/story-0DJ2rnNPna2vtbwwCVnQ3M.html

The police have also been inquiring about his financial transaction. Alwari was produced in the court on Sunday and has been remanded to police custody till June 9. Alwari was arrested on Saturday after the Military Intelligence unit found several calls were coming to Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) from abroad but the numbers were Indian. The calls that were coming from abroad were landing in the illegal telephone exchange in Govandi and later they were diverted to J&K showing the Indian numbers, said deputy commissioner of police Akbar Pathan of the crime branch.The two mobile numbers were traced to Govandi. These two numbers were kept under surveillance. All the calls received by the parallel exchange were made from abroad, added officer. Apart from Mumbai crime branch, the central agencies are also probing if a terror or spy network was operating using multiple SIM boxes as several calls were made to defence establishments in J&K, added official.Following information, the Mumbai crime branch’s unit 6 conducted raid in Govandi in Alwari’s residence and arrested him. During raid police seized a total of five SIM boxes, of which one was inactive, and have also recovered 223 SIM cards, 10 mobile phones, a laptop modem, connection board and batteries in the raid.Alwari was previously arrested in Thane in 2017 for similar crimes. After scrutinising the number and its call records it was found Alwari made and received several calls from other countries like Nepal, several countries from the Gulf and Europe. The accused would illegally convert voice-over-internet telephony (VoIP) calls from abroad into a local call through the illegal international gateway.A SIM box routes international calls as local calls, allowing the box operator to bypass international rates charged by local mobile network operators. The SIM boxes are fitted with hundreds of GSM SIM cards procured using fake IDs.There is a possibility that the parallel exchange suspected to be used for anti-national activities by unfriendly nations.In February this year, the crime branch has busted a similar racket operating from Noida in Uttar Pradesh and Changaramkulam in Kerala. Police seized a total of eight SIM boxes and recovered 686 SIM cards from the raids in the two cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/police-probe-anti-national-activities-by-illegal-telephone-exchange-in-govandi/story-b1zepHJU7JMW1hiFiax15H.html

31-05-2020||Mumbai||Nisarga, first tropical cyclone since 1891 that may hit Maharashtra coast during June||As the India Meteorological Department (IMD) confirmed on Sunday that weather system in the Arabian Sea would intensify into a tropical cyclone, experts said it would be a rare event for Mumbai and Maharashtra coast in June.As per IMD’s Cyclone E-Atlas, a repository that tracks tropical cyclones and weather depressions over the north Indian Ocean since 1891, no weather system has turned into a cyclone and made landfall near Mumbai or along the Maharashtra coast during June. “Only two depressions, in 1948 and 1980, have come close but never turned into a tropical cyclone during June, indicate records,” said Akshay Deoaras, an independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, UK. “Stronger than usual winds and rain are expected at the coast of Maharashtra on June 2 evening and in the first half of June 3. As the warning period will be less, disaster preparedness in coastal areas is immediately advisable,” he added.While IMD is yet to declare the landfall site for the cyclone, private weather forecasting agency Skymet said landfall is expected over north Maharashtra and south Gujarat border. “It will be a cyclonic storm that will move rapidly over these regions leading to intense showers but the weather system will not intensify into a severe or extremely severe cyclone. South Gujarat and north Konkan, including Mumbai, will receive maximum rain on June 3 and the situation will improve thereafter,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet, adding that rain over the city can cause localised flooding.According to weather models, rain will commence over the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) from June 1, mainly in the form of passing showers. On June 2 and the first half of June 3, there will be persistent rainfall along with winds. “The highest intensity is expected between June 2 evening and the morning of June 3. The weather will start normalising from the second half of June 3, after which mostly clear skies and humid weather conditions will continue in Mumbai,” said Deoras.He added it was still unclear whether the weather system would finally develop into a tropical cyclone. “Though there is a consensus among weather models regarding the intensification and track of this low-pressure system, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the low-pressure’s peak intensity. Only the very recent forecasts have suggested the formation of a strong tropical cyclone,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/nisarga-the-first-tropical-cyclone-that-may-hit-state-coast-during-june-since-1891/story-X0W0bKbLYBG7qmadkmjhhM.html

CITU has alleged that the state government is exploiting these professors by not paying them the pending salaries.CITU state president Vijendra Mehra said, “As per the University Grants Commission (UGC), these professors should be paid Rs 1,000 per lecture but in institutes like Regional Centre, Dharamshala, they are only getting Rs 500 per lecture. Likewise, these professors should get Rs 50,000 maximum salary as per UGC rules but they are only being paid Rs 25,000 salary.”“These professors are conducting online classes during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, they have not been given their salaries from February to May,” Mehra said.He said it is a violation of notifications and orders issued by the Centre on March 20 and March 29, 2020, according to which salary of an employee working in government, semi-government and private sector cannot be deducted or withheld.CITU has demanded immediate intervention in this matter by the state government and HPU administration to protect financial and emotional securities of the professors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/release-pending-salaries-of-guest-faculties-in-hpu-trade-union-to-hp-govt/story-za4107yi77hmsi3lqnSkhN.html

We want to increase highways revenue income which will be increased up to Rs one lakh crore as toll income from the highways,” said Gadkari during the webinar.“Yesterday (on Saturday), we got a loan from a foreign bank to be infused in infrastructure projects. We are in talks with big banks and have 400 infrastructure development projects for which RBI has given its in-principle approval for providing finance for the same. Our focus is enhancing the purchasing power, increasing market liquidity which is necessary to accelerate the economy,” he said.Stress on increasing the liquidityGadkari said, “The current situation is a blessing in disguise as nobody wants to trade with China. Japan has already declared its intentions regarding seeking foreign investments. How we bring foreign capital and investment in India needs to be thought out.”“Similarly, upgradation of technology is also important. We need to convert problems into opportunities. During the lockdown, we need to understand the art of living during Covid crisis till we get vaccines. We need to understand our limitations and move forward in these trying times,” Gadkari said.An additional loan of Rs3 lakh crore for MSME sectorThe minister pointed out that the additional loan of Rs 3 lakh crore released by the banks without collateral would help the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME ). During the webinar, Prashant Girbane, director-general, MCCI, raised issues related to cash flows, delayed payments and migrant labourers as the cause of concern before the chambers. To this, Gadkari said the government has recently announced a slew of measures including making available liquidity.“Six lakh MSMEs will be covered and two lakh MSMEs will benefit from the same. Whatever outstanding which needs to be paid is from government undertakings, state undertakings and major industries. We have issued instructions for immediate release the funds and states too have been instructed. We have requested that small industrialists must be given money first.”“It is incorrect that industries are completely dependent on migrant labourers when in actuality it is only 20 per cent. Then, start the industries from thirty per cent and the numbers will increase. Give a letter to the collector and try to bring back the migrant workers by winning their confidence,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/highway-infra-boost-worth-rs15-lakh-crore-in-two-years-gadkari/story-TmgIvVXV8QtEaKw9VtrUeM.html

The community migrated from Pakistan in 1947 and was settled in Nowshera, Udhampur, Kathua, Rajouri and Poonch districts but we have not been given any political representation.”“We have no political voice. We had a MLA in 1987 from Gandhi Nagar assembly constituency and since then there has been no representation. We request Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Delimitation Commission to do justice with us.” Wazir also demanded minority commission in Jammu and Kashmir. “Why is the Centre reluctant in setting up a Delimitation Commission? Why minorities are being deprived of the benefits in J&K,” he said.While Muslims constitute 68.31% of the total population of erstwhile J&K state as per Census 2011, Hindus comprise 28.44%, Christian 0.28%, Sikh 1.87%, Buddhist 0.90% and Jain 0.02 %.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sikh-community-in-j-k-demands-six-assembly-seats-implementation-of-minority-commission/story-L8Ne8urFCZKTvUV2nJRDYN.html

31-05-2020||City||IGMC, Shimla to raise public awareness of heart attack symptoms||In order to increase awareness of heart attack symptoms among people, the department of cardiology at Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla (IGMC) has started a project to improve the use of life-saving treatment in peripheral hospitals of the district using tele ECG diagnostic support system and capacity building of the medical officers here. Doctors intend to improve the awareness of heart attack symptoms in the community through public awareness activities. There are about 25 hospitals in the Shimla district that are participating in the heart care model and doctors are hopeful that it will increase the delivery of life-saving treatment and save the lives of many patients.Head of the cardiology department at IGMC, Prakash Negi said that heart attack is one of the common causes of death in the country and in Himachal Pradesh. High death rates are mainly due to the non-availability of timely treatment, he said. An online data of the state heart attack registry has indicated that only about 30% receive life-saving medicines which are more effective if given in the first few hours of a heart attack. The reasons for the low use of these life-saving drugs are due to the late reporting of patients to hospitals. The delayed reporting to the hospital is mostly due to ignorance on the part of patients, he said.People’s participation in creating awareness about heart attack symptoms, guiding others about the importance of timely reporting to the nearest hospital will save many lives.Patients with heart attack commonly experience chest pain that may move to arms, neck, shoulder, and back. Many patients may also experience marked weakness suddenly, breathing difficulty, may have cold sweats. Some of the patients may also have vomiting, blackout, or loss of consciousness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/igmc-shimla-to-raise-public-awareness-of-heart-attack-symptoms/story-kXTAlpLkWvDxh3y3qPqGdP.html

31-05-2020||Pune||Pune lacks squash infrastructure, says U-17 national champion||For two-time under-17 squash national champion Yoshna Singh who also scored 90 per cent in the Cambridge board examination recently, time management is the path to excellence. According to Singh, Pune lacks quality squash infrastructure in comparison to Mumbai. “In Pune, there aren’t a lot of coaching facilities for squash. I train under Abhinav Sinha who is from Mumbai. I am glad that we have a squash court at Brahma Sun city, where I practice,” Singh said.With her coach in Mumbai, Singh takes online coaching sessions and she is helped by her father and fitness trainer Sandeep Narwade to maintain her focus on the game.“My father first learned the sport by watching videos on YouTube and now he helps me train. If the tournament is scheduled in Mumbai then I have sessions with my coach,” Singh said who is ranked fourth in the under-19 Squash Rackets Federation of India (SRFI).Singh had a tough 2019 since she had to appear for Class 12 exams and also focus on her training. Singh who studies at Vibgyor high, NIBM, excelled in her IGCSE A level (12th Grade) exams with the first rank in commerce stream and third across all streams.“I had planned my year in such a way, where I had divided months for training and studying. My school Vibgyor high, NIBM, has been very supportive always when it comes to my training. With their help, I managed everything well and secured good marks in my exam,” she said.Singh will be now moving to an Ivy League college - the University of Pennsylvania, in the US for further studies.Along with studying, getting trained under top-class coaches for the next four years is on her mind right now.“It will be a completely different exposure as I will be playing with my college team and it will help me take my talent to a different level,” Singh said.Mumbai: Squash hub When it comes to squash, Mumbai dominates above other cities, since infrastructure is yet to get developed in smaller cities.“Mumbai is the hub of squash, players are also coming from other districts but since good training facilities are available in Mumbai, it is producing quality players,” Singh. saidIn the upcoming years, Singh will focus more on playing international tournaments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-lacks-squash-infrastructure-says-u-17-national-champion/story-RTxbI0wfErw61edVS7sBHM.html

31-05-2020||Pune||YourSpace: Lockdown affecting health but exercise a must, say readers||Exercise and gym are an integral part of my life. It is as important as breathing or praying. Hence, the news of lockdown threw my routine off-track. While I did sulk for a day or so wondering what would I do for my fitness regime, within no time I planned a routine that didn’t require me to go outdoors. During the two months when the lockdown was imposed and jogging and walking weren’t allowed on the society premises, I indulged in cardio exercises, yoga, abs workout, and strength training. I have also done some crazy stuff like brisk-walking or jogging inside the house for 5-10 km, 100 suryanamaskars at a stretch, or covering 50 floors climbing up and down the stairs. As for my husband, who has been playing cricket for 3-4 hours every weekend since the past 12-13 years, the lockdown was upsetting. However, since we have a pet dog that needs daily walks, my husband’s exercise meant taking her for early morning and late evening walks within the society premises. My teenage daughter, an athlete, did indoor exercises like chin-ups on the pull-up bar, plank, or suryanamaskar. We have been indulging a lot in salads and seasonal fruits like watermelon, muskmelon and grapes to improve our immunity.Various reports have indicated that Covid-19 is going to be a part of our lives for another year or two. Does that mean we will shut ourselves for two years? The health experts say that the way to build immunity is by eating healthy food and exercising. I am glad that the state government has permitted physical exercise on society premises and public parks now. The fear of catching the virus is still there. But in my view, people should take all precautions like wearing mask, using sanitiser and maintaining social distancing, but they should go out and get their muscles moving by walking, jogging, running or cycling in the fresh air. If not, do indoor exercises. Bottom line is – stay active.Garima MishraLockdown kicks in mental stressI am a little more concerned about the indirect impact of lockdown on our mental health. Most of us have missed going to gym and daily walks. Some might have compensated for it by exercising at home. However, the feeling of being locked inside the house has also left many stressed. Whether voluntarily or by order, I cannot meet friends and family, cannot travel to places I want to, cannot be a part of social activities, and my business opportunities are also reduced during the last two months. Particularly, when I am self-employed and cannot expect a full or part salary when I don’t work. This is taking a toll on self-confidence, pushing many others like me towards an unhealthy state of mind, even depression. Words of wisdom and motivation do not help under such circumstances. If the lockdown is extended any further, the mental health of many will get beyond recovery. I am wondering how can one sustain their morale in these difficult times. Are there any exercises that we can continue at home to keep ourselves fit mentally until we are back to normal if we ever are going to be? Mandar ShindeMaintain healthy immune systemIn these Covid-19 times, which is full of negativity with bombarding of news related to the deadly virus on media, each passing day I have realised the importance of being positive and maintain a strong immune system and good health to keep the disease at bay. In fact, my family has been practicing yoga, pranayam, and other exercises to keep healthy and Covid-19 away during the lockdown period. We also take care to have healthy food. Chitra Mohodhome and office chores unendingThese two months have been specifically very horrible for working women like me with work from home deadlines and taking care of every family member during the lockdown. My 15-month-old child expects his mother should spend time with him. It is very difficult to fulfil the expectations of the office boss and family members during these times. My mental stress has increased and long discussions and meetings through online mode cause severe headache and issue of earache has started. I am unable to do any exercise, though few of my family members are able to do it. I am only trying to manage my office work and house chores. Unavailability of baby care facility and maid-housekeeping services makes my life more difficult during these months. Nalinee SuryawanshiChange your workout regimeI have been trying to workout on my terrace with bricks or stones as my weights, and tera bands. The steps of my building, of course, cannot replace what I can do on the ground or gym but is sufficient to tire me. The major challenge is to find creative ways to keep changing the routine of exercise, but is certainly doable since that is the need of the hour. Keeping the immunity strong is a must during this pandemic and it can be achieved with a mix of good exercise, good nutrition, and rest as well which is fairly doable.Roshan ShettyRegular exercise kept us freshI work at the science park in Savitribai Phule Pune University. I am actively working for popularisation, spreading awareness about science, making science exhibits and kits which are helpful for students at school as well as college. We are habitual of daily morning exercises at home, evening walks, and outdoor exercises. This is an important part of our daily routine before lockdown made me and my family to keep indoors. It was a struggle in the beginning for 3-4 days, but we found out the solution. We continued with daily morning exercises. The evening walk was done at home with restrictions. We increased breathing exercises along with playing indoor badminton. We did more dance practices which made us feel fresh. In the old days, people used to do all the work at home and keep their diet. Since all were home, it resulted in increased household work as well. The same thought we tried to implement. The increased exercises definitely kept us fresh and healthy, but we controlled and managed our eating schedule. Eating less sugary and fatty food and having fresh food is the key to be fit and fine. Harshada BabrekarMore bonding under lockdownThere were so many doubts when lockdown began initially, but it brought out the best in some people. People kept themselves busy with challenges and experimented with stuff in the kitchen, brought out budding artists. Everyone seems to have found some new interest that they never pursued and made an attempt to accomplish them. So in short, for my family as well it turned out to be a time where we could bond better. Keeping the kids occupied was a task initially which we now master without a doubt. Exercising in this period proved beneficial. Thanks to all the online classes we could keep ourselves occupied. So now I and my son spend our evenings dancing together, so playing his favourite sport cricket. Taking necessary precautions, but at the same time making the most of this time. Deepika Fernandes - ShewalePerformed yoga for energy, healthIt was a good life experience but sitting at home was a new type of learning to help the family in household work. It was difficult to sit at home every day. There was no outside life due to lockdown. We formed a small group in our society and exercised at home, performed yoga while maintaining social distancing. In the last two months, we have stayed energetic and healthy. Atul JainSuryanamaskar for better healthFor every individual, exercise plays a very important role in maintaining fitness and fight health-related problems. But now these two months of lockdown have restricted us from performing regular physical activities in the way it used to be done before. But, exercises such as yoga and suryanamaskar can be done regularly. I personally follow a regular routine of performing yoga and suryanamaskar to keep me and my family fit. Suryanamaskar comprises a series of twelve yogasanas performed in a sequence. It is a series of gentle flowing movements synchronized with breathing and can be performed on a mat at home. It is an independent and complete physical exercise that helps tone up the functioning of various systems in the body. It also improves circulation of the blood and reduced stress, calms the mind, removes lethargy, and makes our mind alert and increases the flexibility as well. Until the lockdown is lifted I personally believe it is important to keep ourselves fit and increase our immune systems by performing suryanamaskar regularly to fight this invisible enemy because it has been observed that the virus mostly affects the people with prior diseases. It is important that we remain calm and meditate to keep our minds peaceful. If we want to be happy and live a healthy life, we should perform suryanamaskar- the best exercise daily. Suvarna DeolankarIsolation period dedicated to fitnessI took lockdown as an opportunity to improve on my fitness rather than making it an excuse to not exercise. So, instead of the one hour morning walk and exercises on the bench of the jogging park, I planned out that time at home. I do 15 suryanamaskars followed by yoga and pranayama. In the evening, I used to be in the gym for an hour. Instead, now I sweep and mop the floor followed by exercises chalked out by Dr Pramod Tripathi and conclude with Art of Living’s Sudarshan kriya. To fight Covid-19, you need immunity and a strong upper body. My exercise regimen ensures that. Vinita DeshmukhExercise for a better lifeIf you are healthy then only can you be happy and make others happy. Exercises, yoga, and meditation make you feel better and stress out. Every morning a little time for yourself makes you fit and healthy. Yes, in lockdown we are not able to go out but my family is taking care of their health by playing indoor active games, morning meditation with yoga. It helps us to be happy and fresh for the entire day. Fresh and homemade food helps us to enjoy this lockdown happily as happiness is also the key to a healthy life. So be happy, healthy, and fresh with good and energetic food. This will help you survive from this lockdown period stress-free.Reshu AggarwaalLockdown, a necessary stepLife under lockdown has made every individual stays at home to be safe and prevent themselves from Covid-19. Staying home for more than 2 months now has made individuals lazy and lethargic. We cannot go out for morning or evening walks, gym, or any extracurricular activities which makes us stay fit and healthy. Lockdown has made to be home 24*7, hence with no other option left we have to do light workouts or yoga at home. However, looking at the current situation and an increased number of positive Covid-19 cases, this lockdown is necessary. I hope that the government is taking all the required steps to control Covid-19 cases and would definitely show some good results as far till now.Rohan GoyalOpportunity to improveAfter the Covid-19 pandemic led to a nation-wide lockdown in order to combat the situation, it has brought about several drastic changes in the way people use to interact and function. The social isolation norms have forced many to step away from their day-to-day activities, such as those who use to go out for the gym and other physical activities have to be at home. Apart from this, work from home has emerged as a new way to deliver work and this extended lockdown period can easily make people fall into bad habits, especially for those who are pre-diagnosed with health issues such as diabetes, cardiovascular and other health-related issues. With the uncertainty and changes in the way people live, we need to be more conscious of mental health. As there are several benefits related to positive mental well-being such as reduced anxiety and stress, clearer thinking and mood-improvement, self-esteem boost. This will tend to improve calmness in you.We all must take advantage of this lockdown and utilize the time to detox our mind and soul and also try to improve the bond with our relationships. We should always try to become a better version of us and the current situation is the best opportunity.Shalini SharmaYoga to burn caloriesLockdown severely restricted and made it obligatory to remain indoors. It is not possible to go jogging or walking. One has to be fit and burn calories, the best option I have adapted is yoga for 45 minutes every day in the morning. It increases my flexibility and improves my respiratory, energy, and vitality. Yoga has exploded all over the country. ​​​​Anoop Panjwani​​Outdoor activities will improve immunityIt has been more than 2 months of lockdown because of the Covid-19 pandemic.​​ The routine health activities like jogging, morning walk, gym, swimming, trekking have been completely stopped.​​ Senior citizens and other residents are demanding some guidelines to maintain health.​​ The basic outdoor activities will improve immunity and empower us to fight any kind of disease.​​​Akhil Singh​​||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/yourspace-lockdown-affecting-health-but-exercise-a-must-say-readers/story-liBF6B29ILHmYb7hyNO9EM.html
31-05-2020||Pune||Outgoing air passengers outnumber incoming flyers at Pune’s Lohegaon airport||The number of flyers leaving the city surpassed those landing at Lohegaon airport, as limited number of domestic flights resumed operations from May 25.On Saturday, 745 persons arrived through 10 flights, whereas 1,148 left the city through eight flights. As of May 30, 3,676 passengers arrived in Pune, while 7,563 flew out of the city. As per the numbers shared by Pune airport director Kuldeep Singh, for every one passenger who arrived in the city, two have left Pune.With the number of Covid-19 cases rising in the city and costly road travel, people have preferred to fly and most of them are returning to their native places, said an aviation expert.As per information shared by Singh, on May 25, the first day when the domestic flight services resumed across the country after almost two months, 672 passengers arrived in the city through nine flights while 985 left the city through eight flights. On May 26, 719 arrived in the city through 14 flights while 1,434 left the city through 14 flights; on May 27, 663 came into the city through 14 flights while 1,364 left the city through 13 flights and on May 28, 552 arrived in the city through 12 flights and 1,313 left the city through 12 flights.According to Dhairyashil Vandekar, an aviation expert, although airports have started functioning, they must streamline the state policies regarding airports and those arriving through flights. And since the first transmission of the virus in the country happened through flight, safety precautions and screening must be given highest priority.She said, “Pune is a commercial and education hub and so we have many who have migrated to the city, which is now a Covid-19 hotspot. So, it is obvious that people want to leave the city. Those leaving the city are the ones who did not find rail or road travel safe and can now travel via a flight which is not only the fastest means of transport, but also the safest.”“The state government must now come with a common policy for those arriving through flights from red zone districts instead of completely banning flights. The situation is still evolving and new developments will keep coming in. Also, in addition to thermal scanning the passengers, airports must also opt for pulse oxymeters to screen fliers,” Vandekar said.Train travellersAccording to officials, a total of 1.16 lakh people left Pune district via 91 trains since the lockdown began. A total of 37 trains carrying 47,000 passengers travelled to Uttar Pradesh, while 23 trains carrying 30,000 passengers travelled to Bihar. The remaining trains were scheduled to travel to various other states.Back to the skyDate arrival pax departure pax arrival flights departure flightsMay 25 672 985 9 8May 26 719 1,434 14 14May 27 663 1,364 14 13May 28 552 1,313 12 12May 29 525 1,390 13 12 May 30 745 1,148 10 8||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/outgoing-air-passengers-outnumber-incoming-flyers-at-pune-s-lohegaon-airport/story-VeLTPPlpGCZ9MlAOSdZHIL.html
31-05-2020||Kolkata||Private bus owners in West Bengal divided over resuming services||The West Bengal government has allowed inter-district movement of state transport undertaking and private bus services from Monday, but the private operators are divided over recommencing services with a lesser number of passengers owing to the social distancing norms.While the Bus Minibus Samannoy Samity on Sunday said that it will recommence services in some routes on an experimental basis, the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates said it will not be possible to run buses with only sitting capacity passengers on current fares as that would lead to losses.In a meeting of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates on Sunday, it was decided that a memorandum will be given to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Transport Minister Suvendu Adhikary on Tuesday, seeking formation of a regulatory body for revising fares, its general secretary Tapan Banerjee said.Rahul Chatterjee, secretary of Bus Minibus Samannoy Samity (coordination committee), another body of bus owners in the state, said that buses will be run on some routes in Kolkata and the districts from Monday on an experimental basis.They, however, demanded that the government consider an increase in fares so as to keep the services going without causing losses to the owners.“As it is, the buses have been idling since March 22.A lot of money has to be spent to make these roadworthy again.We seek the government waive road tax for the period that the buses have not been plying and also seek the Centre’s intervention in reducing insurance premium,” Chatterjee said.He said that the government should also provide its infrastructure for sanitising the buses at its various facilities and also provide face masks and gloves and hand sanitisers to the staff.The West Bengal government, in an order issued on Saturday, allowed intra-state (inter-district) movement of government and private buses from June 1, with passengers not more than the actual seating capacity of the bus.“No passenger shall be allowed to travel standing in the bus. All passengers shall wear face masks and gloves during the entire journey,” the order said.It has not said anything about restarting of inter- state bus services.West Bengal Transport Corporation is already running buses on 40 city routes, while SBSTC and NBSTC are running buses in the districts in south Bengal and north Bengal.All these STUs have already recommenced inter-district bus services from May 27.Private bus operators have stayed away from resuming services as their demands for increasing fares were not met by the state government.The private bus operators had demanded a nearly three-time hike in fares, claiming that carrying only 20 passengers at a time in each bus as per the government directive for maintaining social distancing norms owing to the coronavirus pandemic would lead to huge losses for them.The state government had earlier allowed only 20 passengers in a bus at a time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/private-bus-owners-in-west-bengal-divided-over-resuming-services/story-Xto6nkIOYtdHtGVJy3NrPM.html

31-05-2020||Jaipur||Industrialists in state voice discontent with govt stimulus package||More than 80 percent industrialists in Rajasthan, a majority of them owning micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), are dissatisfied with the centre’s stimulus package, FICCI has found in a survey.The online survey by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry or FICCI included 107 industry members, mostly of MSMEs in Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Kota, Ajmer, Bhiwadi, Alwar and Bhilwara to capture the status of operations, feedback on migration of labourers and the Rs 29 lakh crore stimulus package announced by the centre recently.In the survey, 83.2% of respondents mentioned that the stimulus package was “not so effective”, 15% respondents found it “effective” and 1.8% found it “very effective”.Atul Sharma, director, FICCI Rajasthan state council, said most of the small and medium industries were looking at a relief package instead of a stimulus package. “These units are under financial burden as they are not getting any revenue, but there is cash outflow. So, they were looking at some relief in expenses and some kind of grants from the government,” he said.He said the industry association had apprised the state government and the centre of its demand before the package was announced. “The three main components of the package were waiver of fixed charges in electricity bills for the lockdown period, help in payment of salaries to workers in the lockdown and waiving interest on loans. However, these have not been met,” he said.According to the survey, 72% respondents said migration of labourers has affected their business.Sharma said the government’s recent initiative to create an online labour employment exchange is a good idea. “This is a good initiative and would help the existing and new industries in finding human resource as per their needs. There are many established portals for white collar jobs but this one is a great initiative for blue collar jobs,” he said.Almost 90 percent respondents in the survey said their capacity utilisation is below 50 percent. The survey found that 27.1% respondents are operating at less than 10% capacity, 32.7% respondents are doing capacity utilisation between 10% and 25%, 89.7% respondents are doing capacity utilisation of less than 50% and 2.8% respondents indicated capacity utilisation above 75%.Sharma said this is partly due to labour shortage, but mainly due to lack of demand.“There is no place to send the material to as there is no demand,” he said.Ashok Kajaria, chairman, FICCI Rajasthan State Council & CMD, Kajaria Ceramics Ltd said, “We hope Lockdown 5.0 or Exit 1.0 would bring more positive changes and liberal guidelines as now thrust of both central and state government is on reviving the economy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/80-industry-owners-dissatisfied-with-centre-s-stimulus-package-ficci-survey/story-PMaFInLRPI8eyhvv12ATVM.html

Migrants were flown back home from Andaman & Nicobar a day after 60 stranded workers returned to the state from Leh by a service flight arranged by the state government. “The expenses of both the flights are borne by the Hemant Soren government”, an official statement said here.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage The returnees will be sent by buses to their respective districts after health test, officials said. The migrants said they were given food and shelter by the Andaman administration, NGOs and fellow natives, settled in the island for several decades. Migrant workers were flown back home in charter flights by the Jharkhand government after the chief minister wrote to Union Home minister Amit Shah on May 21, seeking permission to operate flights to bring back stranded migrant workers from Andaman-Nicobar Islands, Ladakh and the northeast as they could not be ferried by buses or trains. The returnees from Andaman & Nicobar had requested the Jharkhand government to make arrangement for their return as they were stranded in the Island following the nationwide lockdown. The chief minister had also agreed that bringing migrants from some places by train or buses was very difficult and air route was necessary to end mental stress of the migrants. After emerging from Ranchi’s Birsa Munda Airport, a labourer said, “Many of us worked in road construction projects and endured much pain due to the lockdown.” He said they were engaged in road construction between South Andaman and North Andaman. Another labourer said, “We were staying in South Andaman and got food from the administration, NGOs and some people from Jharkhand who have stayed there for a long time.” The migrants went through health screening before they boarded the flight at Port Blair, officials said. Four years ago, a young tribal woman, who then worked in a shop there, had told visiting journalists from Jharkhand that her forefathers had come to the Island from the state several decades ago and their generations have settled there and also contributed to the development of Andaman. “Now several generations have settled here (Andaman) and are earning livelihood,” she said, tracing her roots to Jharkhand. According to a Port Blair-based journalist, several natives of this region of the country, which is now known as Jharkhand, were brought to the island in 1930s by the British for infrastructure works and they stayed there since. “Even a place is named as ‘Ranchi-Tegri’ and some of the states natives also stay at Bartang,” he said. Nearly 4.5 lakh of around 7 lakh migrant workers spread across the country have reached Jharkhand since May 1 by special trains, buses and now flights. Till Friday, 313 out of the total 522 confirmed coronavirus cases are migrants. The infection has claimed five lives since the outbreak of the pandemic on March 31. Jharkhand Water & Sanitation Minister Mithilesh Thakur, who reached the airport to welcome the third batch of migrants returning by flight in as many days, said another flight would take off from Andaman on Sunday. “This is the third flight which brought migrant workers from places where trains or buses are difficult to bring them. Tomorrow another flight will take off from Andaman & Nicobar Island,” Thakur told reporters. “The government is working to give employment to them in the state,” he added. Besides Thakur, senior MLA and former deputy chief minister Stephen Marandi was also present at the airport and handed food packets to returnees. They said Jharkhand is the state where the first train and the first flight carrying migrant pravasis reached the state during the lockdown. A migrant, who hails from Bokaro said, “We were in distress, but now feel relieved after reaching Ranchi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/after-leh-jharkhand-govt-flies-180-migrants-from-andaman-in-charter-flight/story-ft60VBxCCCyILVBZE5LMxO.html

India took 79 days to record these many deaths, while some of the major Covid-19 hotspots - such United States, United Kingdom, Spain and Italy - took less than a third of this duration to rack up similar counts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/active-covid-19-cases-increase-in-delhi-but-recovery-rate-improves-to-43-per-cent/story-IZNnAvrY7aYyHSjjUpwl2K.html
31-05-2020||Delhi||JCC members’ incitement caused Delhi riots: Police||A city court heard the bail application of Safoora Zargar, the 20-week-pregnant Jamia Millia Islamia student, and Jamia Co-ordination Committee(JCC) member on Saturday and posted the matter for further hearing on June 4. Meanwhile, it granted interim bail to co-accused Ishrat Jahan for 10 days (June 10-19) on the grounds that her marriage is scheduled on June 12.The Delhi police special cell on Saturday told the court that members of JCC incited people at different protest sites, created blockades and caused the riots in north east Delhi earlier this year. The special cell, which is the anti-terrorist unit of the force, registered a case to probe if the riots were part of a larger conspiracy.Thus far, two members of JCC have been arrested in the case. The riots, between February 24-26, left at least 53 people dead. The JCC is a group of former and current students of the university that came together to coordinate the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests outside the varsity. A JCC member, who wished not to be named, told HT, “JCC’s idea was to resist the fascist law combination of CAA/NRC/NPR. Road blockade is a way of protesting all over the world...We have reiterated that JCC believes in the constitution and democratic ways of social transition and right to dissent....Delhi police want to suppress all the resistance against the government... and it’s fascist laws. There has been backlash from the court about the arbitrary nature of the enquiry, and from the public about their revengeful actions.”During the proceedings, Special Judge Dharmender Rana also sought to know the link between Unlawful Activites Prevention Act (UAPA) under which Zargar and the other accused have been arrested and the road blockades: “What is the connecting link between UAPA and road blocks. UAPA cannot be invoked for blocking roads. Show me the link.”The police said that the idea was to frustrate the people, paralyse the government and orchestrate riots. “It is not just about Safoora Zargar. She is a part of the chain... People sitting in various sites were asked to move and block the roads...,” the police said. The police said that the intent was to create blockades such as the one at Shaheen Bagh, and cause riots thereby giving a wrong impression during the visit of US President Donald Trump.At Shaheen Bagh, locals were protesting since December 15, 2019, against the CAA and NRC. They were evicted on March 25 this year in view of the lockdown as well as prohibitory orders issued under Section 144 CrPC. Opposing Zargar’s bail application, public prosecutor Irfan Ahmed, said she visited Chand Bagh (where many incidents of violence were reported) and delivered a provocative speech. Meanwhile, Natasha Narwal, arrested member of Pinjra Tod, was produced before a special judge. The matter was heard in the evening; the order is yet to be uploaded. Devangana Kalita, another accused, was sent to three day police custody in connection with the FIR filed in the Daryaganj violence case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jcc-members-incitement-caused-delhi-riots-police/story-fCLIvBTsELkUqPRymCSJ0K.html

From June 1, lockdown will be enforced in containment zone A, while containment zones B and C will be offered relaxations. “It is felt necessary to continue to implement the lockdown in the affected areas (containment zones) to effectively contain the spread of Covid-19 and open up activities in other areas for socio-economic revival,” said a government notification issued by the chief secretary.The order said a strict lockdown will be imposed in the affected areas, with no relaxations. Relaxations will be allowed in containment zones B and C from June 1, with the resumption of work in tea gardens, jute mills, micro, small, medium & large industries, and the construction industry .Intra-state movement of government and private buses has also been allowed with passengers not exceeding the seating capacity of the vehicle. No passengers will be allowed to travel standing and all passengers must wear masks and gloves.While the Union ministry of home affairs has allowed opening of religious places from June 8, Bengal has allowed it from June 1 with not more than 10 persons gathering at a time. It was not immediately clear if Bengal will revise its stand. The state has also allowed all offices and industries to resume work with 100% workforce beyond the “affected areas”.Restaurants and shopping malls have been allowed to open on June 1. Government offices will function with 70% of the workforce on a rotational basis. While the government said it encouraged private offices to adopt a work-from-home policy, the number of staff in offices will be decided by the companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/lockdown-5-0-bengal-allows-some-relaxations-restaurants-malls-can-reopen/story-NzyZpP6rauKIuftzhSTY1O.html

He was arrested from his Punjabi Bagh house in the city, having landed in the country around two months ago, in the wee hours of Saturday. A court had declared him a proclaimed offender in 1993. Nirmal, the manager at UCO Bank, had been booked by in 1990 in a case registered at the CBI Police station. He had also remained in jail for two years before being bailed out. On being granted bail, Nirmal went underground, while his family cremated an ‘unclaimed body’ by showing it as that of Nirmal, the CBI now says. With Nirmal ‘dead’ in the record of the CBI, he got a fake passport in the name of NS Batth and migrated to the US, where he managed to get citizenship. Later, he also got his wife and children with him and was leading a lavish life there. His wife Parminder Kaur Batth had also started a web news channel, named Bulandh TV. “Following a tip-off that Nirmal is alive and has come back to Patiala, we conducted a raid and arrested him. On seeing us, he fell unconscious. He was provided medical aid,” said inspector Vikas Kumar, who led the CBI team, adding that he would be produced in court after his covid-19 test report. Sources said a close aide of Nirmal, who had entered into a tiff with him in recent times, had informed the central agency about his whereabouts. Now, the CBI has also named his wife Parminder in a new FIR charging her with cheating, for concealing the whereabouts of her husband, and helping him flee.&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&Strap/BlurbNow a US citizen, the then bank manager had committed a fraud of Rs 2.5 lakh in UCO Bank in Chandigarh in 1985; then enacted the drama of his own death with the help of wife to flee abroad||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cbi-arrests-fraudster-declared-dead-30-years-ago-in-patiala/story-2Q17cdxVUzWkYGoGor7K0O.html

The market saw a trickle of customers since recent relaxations. However, a covid case was reported in the market on Friday, prompting the authorities to close the market. “After a shopkeeper tested positive, the administration has asked all of the shopkeepers to take precautions. As many as 60 traders will have to shut their shops for some more days,” Amritsar Federation of Cloth Wholesalers’ chairman Jatinder Singh Bhatia said.He said the infected trader had made a business trip to Kashmir, but it is yet to be ascertained from where he contracted the infection. “Ever since we opened our outlets, we are taking precautions and following the government guidelines,” he added.Over 5,000 traders are into wholesale cloth business across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/trader-contracts-virus-amritsar-s-new-cloth-market-shuts-again/story-eANmPticFPtr4vWIqZNyGL.html
31-05-2020||Chandigarh||SAD to launch state-wide stir if free power to farmers goes||Chandigarh The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday resolved to launch state-wide protests, in case the Captain Amarinder Singh government in Punjab scraps free power to agriculture tubwells. No schedule for protest was announced. In 1997, the SAD-BJP government had introduced free power for all tube wells across Punjab. “We will not let the government impose bills on tubewells. If that happens, the government will have to face the anger of people of Punjab,” SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said in the party’s core committee meeting. On Wednesday, the state cabinet took an in-principle decision saying that it will provide direct benefit transfer (DBT) of power subsidy to farmers for using tubewells. The decision will put an end to existing system of giving in advance a lump sum amount to PSPCL for electricity consumed by 14 lakh tubewells in the state. The issue has given the Akalis a chance to touch base with the state peasantry, its major vote bank, which had distanced itself from the SAD, after series of incidents of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib in 2015. The then Akali-BJP government in the state was blamed for the desecrations. By resorting to the party’s old style of agitation politics, SAD see a chance to mobilise its workers, and rejuvenate its beleaguered support base in rural Punjab.Dismissing a statement by Amarinder that the cabinet had never contemplated any move to scrap the free power facility for farmers and replace it with a direct benefit transfer scheme (DBT), the core committee resolved, “If the Congress government tries to force the decision on farmers through the backdoor under the pretext of cash subsidy to farmers, the SAD will not remain a mute witness to it,” it said. “Initially, Punjab ministers confirmed the decision of imposing bills on tubewells. When when we declared to launch an agitation against the government, the CM and the state government panicked and felt compelled to deny the move,” Sukhbir told the core committee. The committee also condemned the government for allowing 80% increase in fee in medical colleges and sought its withdrawal. It also condoled the passing away of former MP Gurdas Singh Badal. In other major issues, the core committee sought a package for the poor from the state government. “The Congress government announced relief of Rs 676 crore to liquor contractors and land mining mafia (Rs 84 crore) but has not given a penny to farmers, labourers, domestic power consumers or the industry,” it said. The SAD has also demanded a CBI inquiry into the sale of spurious seeds and another impartial inquiry into reported losses of Rs. 5,600 crore caused to the state exchequer due to a scam in liquor sale. “The scam is patronised by the MLAs of the ruling party and the hot-spot is Rajpura and Patiala. No action is being taken,” the party said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-to-launch-state-wide-stir-if-free-power-to-farmers-goes/story-ysKYjeNETjLjQDd2b2RXUP.html
31-05-2020||Chandigarh||Will not compromise with farmers’ interest, says Captain Amarinder Singh||Rejecting allegations of withdrawal of free power to farmers in Punjab, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Saturday said his government is ready to forego the portion of fiscal deficit enhancement offered by the Centre, but would not compromise with the farmers’ interest at any cost.Dismissing the Centre’s suggestion on replacement of free power to farmers with direct benefit transfer (DBT) unacceptable and attack on the federal structure of the nation, the CM said he will take up the issue with the Union government for trying to impose such anti-farmer condition on the cash-strapped state in the guise of extending fiscal support amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Asserting that the free power facility for farmers will continue till his government is in power, Amarinder said his government will take loans to bridge the fiscal deficit, and the government of India cannot dictate the terms of a sovereign loan being taken by a state government.The CM also lashed out at Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief Sukhbir Singh Badal for trying to pin the blame for the Central government’s misdemeanours on the state government, which had unwaveringly been providing free power to farmers since taking over in March 2017, despite the massive fiscal crunch it had inherited from the erstwhile Akali-BJP regime. Amarinder asked Sukhbir to quit the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre and demanded Union minister and Akali leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal’s resignation from the Union cabinet. He pointed that it was the government at the Centre that took the decision directing the states to withdraw the free power.Terming their allegations malicious, mischievous and unsubstantiated, Amarinder hit out at the Akali leadership for not fighting for the rights of Punjab and its people, including farmers, at the Centre or in Parliament, and resorting, instead, to petty and shameless politicking even on such a grave issue of national concern.“If you have even an iota of shame, you should leave the NDA coalition, of which you are a part, immediately, and join my government in working for the people of the state,” the CM said in a statement, criticising Sukhbir and Harsimrat over their pathetic attempts to mislead the people of Punjab with their patent double standards, blatant falsehoods and unfounded allegations.Amarinder clarified that the state cabinet had, in its last meeting, given an in-principle approval to undertaking certain reforms to become eligible to avail additional borrowing of 1.5% of gross state domestic product (GSDP) amid Covid-19, as mandated by the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/will-not-compromise-with-farmers-interest-says-captain-amarinder-singh/story-XSbztqH1tjprXGhu5BUVLI.html

31-05-2020||Chandigarh||PRTC to double buses plying on Punjab roads from tomorrow||The Pepsu Road Transport Corporation (PRTC) is set to nearly double the number of buses it is currently plying on the Punjab roads from Monday with a view to ensuring that commuters using public transport do not face any inconvenience. Two hundred buses will be pressed into service against the present 110. The state government-run transporter had resumed its service on May 20 after relaxations in the ongoing lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The decision on stoppages is yet to be taken as the buses currently are running directly from one boarding station to the other and that too on inter-district routes. The state government is yet to give nod to the private transporters to begin service.PRTC managing director (MD) Jaskaran Singh said besides increasing number of buses, the depot managers have been directed to follow the time table strictly.“Earlier, the buses waited for the number of passengers as per occupancy norms before starting journey. But from June 1, the buses will run as per the timetable. More buses will ply on key routes, especially towards Chandigarh so that people could easily visit the state capital for work,” the MD said. “The number of buses will be increased gradually. Service on other key routes and in other rural areas will be resumed as per the state government’s directions,” he added.The corporation, which has fleet of 1,073 buses in nine depots, faced a loss of ₹51 crore in the first 60 days of the lockdown, with average daily loss pegged at ₹85 lakh. Also, not many people are preferring to travel in public transport due to fear of contracting coronavirus. With only 30% of occupancy, the PRTC is already finding it financially unviable to ply its buses on roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/prtc-to-double-buses-plying-on-punjab-roads-from-tomorrow/story-bdJvxfRfR86d65X0HhAZJM.html

Ministry of external affairs (MEA) deputy secretary Sandeep Kumar said the repatriation process has been initiated but the date of their return is yet to be finalised. A senior official of the Land Port Authority of India (LPAI), which manages the Integrated Check Post (ICP) at the international border, said, “We expect the return of those stranded after Monday. It will most likely be on Tuesday.”The ICP also facilitates India’s trade with Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Satbir Singh (60), his wife Jasmeen Kaur along with three others from Amritsar had gone to pay obeisance at Nankana Sahib on March 10. They have been staying at the house of Amrik Singh, a Lahore residemt. “The health department in Pakistan has conducted their coronavirus tests as part of the repatriation process and they were found negative. My father is unwell as the medicines prescribed to him are not available at drug stores there,” said Satbir’s son Kamaljeet Singh, who deals in auto spare parts in Amritsar. On May 27, the Indian government had facilitated the return of 179 Pakistani nationals, who were aso stranded due to the lockdown, through the land route.

The state governments are also in a severe economic crisis as their sources of income were nosediving. In such a situation, everyone was expecting some relief from the PM,” Jakhar said.He said the “so-called” package of Rs 20 lakh crore had nothing to do with farmers and people of the low-income group. The economy of the country was in dire straits and the Union government was on a completely disoriented path which had no policy or intention to lead the country, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pm-s-open-letter-to-people-a-nasty-joke-jakhar/story-XKLNt4SbWVpq31MeO1iUGL.html

Arshdeep Singh Sidhu and Lovepreet Singh Thind, who run IELTS coaching institutes, complain of losing peak business season from April to September. “We cannot demand this, but it will be a goodwill gesture from the building owners if they waive off the pending rent. Bathinda is an academic coaching hub and state should have some relief plan for this sector,” said Thind.Sukhraj Singh, who had ventured into the business of PG accommodations for girl students two years back, has to close down operations earlier this month.Sharda Kapoor, who has taken a flat and two independent houses on rent, is also worried about the business that she had started 15 years back. “There has been no income in the last two months and the rental amounts are piling up. Soon, I will have to take a final decision,” she said.Navneet Goyal, who owns a stationery shop, says order of closure of coaching institutes has severely hit our business. “IELTS training centres contribute a sizable amount to the local economy. I am facing over 85% loss in business,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pg-owners-small-entrepreneurs-battle-for-survival-in-bathinda/story-yUcN2iBtgKricm6dlvmDKN.html
31-05-2020||Chandigarh||Pandemic, curbs push IELTS centres, visa facilitators to brink in Jalandhar and Ludhiana||Those running International English Language Testing System (IELTS) coaching centres and visa consultancy firms in Jalandhar and Ludhiana are out of business. There are around 1,500 IELTS and visa consultancy firms in Jalandhar district and 750 in Ludhiana, many of them struggling to pay the rent and salaries to the staff. An umbrella organization of such firms — Study Abroad Association — in Ludhiana recently submitted a memorandum to deputy commissioner seeking relief in rent and other measures to pull out them out of the distress. The memorandum was forwarded to the chief minister’s office.The centres in Ludhiana train around 35,000 to 40,000 candidates for immigration every year and most of them run from rented premises that costs between ₹1 lakh to ₹2.5 lakh a month. President of the association Mitesh Malhotra, who runs seven IELTS and visa consultancy centres in Ludhiana, said the period between April and September is the peak season, when a majority of aspirants join universities or colleges abroad.“Even if we start IELTS classes by June or July-end with 30% of capacity, only one-fourth of the 40,000 students will be able to go abroad for the January intake and the commission that we will get from the universities will arrive by April next year,” he said.Criticising the government for not supporting coaching and consultancy establishments at this time, Malhotra said governments hold NRI sammelans (congregations) to appreciate the contribution made by NRIs for the development of the state, they have no regard for the establishments that help in making these people NRIs.Gagneet Singh Grewal, who runs a visa-cum-consultancy centre in Ludhiana’s Ferozepur Gandhi Market, said, “If the government fails to curb the spread of coronavirus, some countries might not allow the migration of Indians and many students who had earlier planned to study abroad might drop the idea.”Nina Rahul Gupta, who runs an IELTS and immigration centre in Jalandhar, said “We have been providing IELTS classes online for our students. There has been uncertainty among the students due to travel restrictions and we are flooded with queries.”Also, trainers at several IELTS centres in Jalandhar are waiting for salaries since April.

31-05-2020||City||Parents protest outside Panchkula school over ‘fee hike’||More than 40 parents protested for over two hours outside St Soldier Divine Public School, Sector 16, Panckula, over a ‘hike’ in fees, on Saturday. They raised slogans of “No school, no fee” and “Make education free for all”. In a signed letter that was later pasted on the school’s gate, the parents wrote: “ Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, we are not in a position to afford the fee structure uploaded by the school on its portal.”Parents demanded that there should be full fee concession for three months – April, May and June, as no classes were conducted.“From July onwards, we will only pay the amended tuition fee of ₹3,050 per month. No additional cost like annual charges should be levied for whole academic year,” the letter said.One of the parents who participated in the protest said: “In February, the school revised the fees from ₹3050 to ₹3,367, which we thought is the annual hike of 10%. In March, when we logged into the school portal to submit the fees, we found the school was now charging ₹5,200.”“When we raised the issue, the fee was reduced back to ₹3050 for April and May. But now, from June onwards, it has been changed back to ₹5,200, plus ₹2,200 as bus charges.”Another parent said: “We are not ready to pay the hiked fee. Due to the lockdown, many businesses have been adversely affected. Many have taken salary cuts and lost jobs. Amid such a scenario, how can school authorities expect us to pay the increased fee?”Neera M Singh, manager of the school, said, “In the previous academic year, the school was charging fees under two heads; one was monthly fee of ₹3,050 and another under the ‘other charges’ category, which the school charged twice a year, amounting to ₹20,000.”“This academic year, on the parents’ request, we combined the two fee structures and added 10% hike, as per government norms. So, the new fee was ₹ 5,200. This was conveyed to parents much in advance.”The manager said: “For the lockdown period, the school is charging last year’s fee of ₹ 3,050 and nothing else. The parents don’t understand that the school has only merged the fee structures and has not raised it much.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/parents-protest-outside-panchkula-school-over-fee-hike/story-jKwnqRI3B7BvaSnmYNiunL.html

31-05-2020||Chandigarh||Parents protest against fee collection by schools in Chandigarh||Parents staged protests on Saturday outside St Kabir High School, Sector 26, and St Joseph’s School, Sector 44, against the collection of fees despite classes being suspended amid the Covid-19 lockdown. Similar protests were witnessed outside two private schools in the city on Friday as well.In the last one week, over eight such protests have been held by parents.The parents said their economic condition has taken a huge hit amid the lockdown and they can’t afford to pay the fees due to loss of jobs. They added that schools were charging for facilities like air-conditioners and electricity which are not being used as classes are suspended.Nitin Goyal, president of the Chandigarh Parents’ Association said, “Due to the UT administration’s negligence and greed of the school managements, parents have been forced to come out on the roads.”GS Bakshi, administrator of St Kabir High School, said, “I am aware that parents have been financially affected by the pandemic. However, some parents are misusing the Covid situation. They have probably been mislead or misinformed. We made it clear that if any parent has a problem, they can discuss the situation with us. The approach of pressurising the school management by staging protests will not work. We will follow the rules laid down by the UT administration and expect parents to do the same.”Monica Chawala, principal of St Joseph’s School, could not be reached for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/parents-protest-against-fee-collection-by-schools-in-chandigarh/story-PwWoPVEW0er9ZMu6k9QRXP.html

The MHA guidelines have also paved way for opening of religious places. But resumption of Delhi Metro services will have to wait for third phase of lifting of restrictions as per the MHA guidelines.Delhi government is in favour of resumption of Metro services to revive normal transport and commercial activities.As per its recommendation to enhance timing of opening markets, the MHA has extended curfew timings. The shops that stayed open from 7 am to 7 pm can keep their shutters up till 9pm.The MHA has said that lockdown will continue till June 30 in containment zones to be be demarcated by district authorities.Delhi currently has 122 containment zones -- areas three or more Covid-19 cases have been found. So far 53 containment zone have been decontained after no fresh cases were reported in 28 days, according to official data.

No one can predict that the coronavirus will go away if the lockdown is extended for one or two months. We have to learn to live with it and we have to arrange for everything required to treat Covid-19 patients,” Kejriwal said at a press conference on Saturday.The Delhi government will explore the possibility of allowing hotels, restaurants and other hospitality services to function in the light of MHA guidelines, the government source said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/most-recommendations-of-delhi-govt-about-lifting-lockdown-accepted-by-centre-source/story-V32blTpXArdM80Z3IG6b6M.html
31-05-2020||City||Khanna police station torture: Unable to meet SIT officials, LIP leaders remove kurta in protest||High drama was witnessed outside the office of Khanna senior superintendent of police (SP) Harpreet Singh on Saturday as Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) leaders Manwinder Singh Giaspura and Sarabjit Singh Kang, along with their supporters, removed their kurtas in protest after they were not allowed to meet the SIT officials looking into the police station torture case.The case pertains to the alleged stripping and torture of a former sarpanch’s husband, her son and husband’s aide by inspector Baljinder Singh, the former station house officer (SHO) of Khanna. A video purportedly showing the incident was also circulated on social media sites.The special investigation team (SIT), formed by DGP Dinkar Gupta, was in town to investigate the matter when LIP leaders, along with their supporters, demanded to meet them. The party leaders said that there were several other people who wanted to file their complaints against the former SHO for torture.“We came here to meet additional director general of police (ADGP) Dr Naresh Arora, who is heading the SIT, but weren’t allowed. We staged a protest following which the SSP has assured us that he will arrange a meeting with SIT members, but after sometime, the ADGP left the office. In protest, we have removed our kurtas,” said Giaspura.The LIP leader also alleged that instead of taking action against the SHO, police have transferred the inspector to Ferozepur. He demanded an FIR against the SHO and his dismissal from the force. “If an FIR is not lodged against the former SHO, we will block national highway,” he added.Later, superintendent of police (SP, detective) Jagwinder Singh received complaints from the complainants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/khanna-police-station-torture-unable-to-meet-sit-officials-lip-leaders-remove-kurta-in-protest/story-j3uqyS0CfDM0ArasZWb7EK.html
31-05-2020||Mumbai||State proposes submerged plateau off Malvan to be declared as protected area||Less than a week before World Environment Day (June 5), the Maharashtra forest department has proposed the declaration of the 2,011 sq km Angria Bank as a protected area.The proposal seeks to declare Angria Bank as a ‘Designated Area’ under the Maritime Zones Act, 1976, which if approved by the Centre, will be the first such marine protected zone in India located in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ).Angria Bank, 105 km (56.7 nautical miles) off Malvan in the Sindhudurg district of Konkan region, is considered a submerged plateau. The coral formation, located at a depth of 20 to 400 metres, consists of 29 genera and 39 species of both hard and soft corals with the reef showing no evident signs of bleaching (turning white due to rising sea surface temperatures as an aftermath of climate change) yet. This is based on an expedition carried out in collaboration with Centre for Marine Living Resources (CMLRE) under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, Mangrove Foundation and Wildlife Conservation Society between December 18 and 30.The study found 123 species of fish, 43 species of invertebrates, numerous species of dolphins and whales among other marine animals including the critically endangered sawfish, which is protected under schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The proposed boundary for protection is approximately 61-km long and 50-km wide.Though India may miss its international Aichi target of identifying 10% marine-protected areas by 2020, protecting Angria Bank will contribute to it since limited marine areas around the country are currently protected.Aichi targets are an international framework of identifying wildlife and marine protected areas by 2020 developed by the International Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The proposal to conserve the area was made by the state mangrove cell on April 29 and approved by the state chief wildlife warden on May 27. “Though marine regions have been notified as sanctuaries under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, the Union environment ministry does not have powers to afford legal protection to a marine area beyond Indian territorial waters (12 nautical miles) owing to jurisdictional constraints. Thus, protecting this area falls within the purview of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976,” read the proposal. The proposal was submitted before the state government for final approval earlier this week, and will soon be sent to the Union environment ministry. “This will be a feather in the cap for the protected area network for Maharashtra and India. Based on the final approval, we will be able to showcase the marine wealth close to the state’s coastline. Considering the threatened status of the rich coral diversity, protecting this massive area is essential from the conservation point of view,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra.“Protected status will restrict threats such as overfishing, oil, natural gas and mineral exploration, no hindrance for marine traffic, and most importantly protect the coral, algal, and other marine diversity,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove cell).On May 6, the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun had also written to the Inspector General of Forests under the Union environment ministry proposing Angria Bank as a ‘Designated Area’ for marine biodiversity conservation under the Maritime Zones Act, 1976. The ministry is yet to respond to WII. Marine biologist Sarang Kulkarni, who carried out the first documentation of the marine biodiversity of Angria Bank in 2010, said, “This is a welcome decision as this area is India’s Great Barrier Reef. While there are reports of coral bleaching across the world, this is one site along the Indian coastline where corals remain untouched despite the rising sea surface temperatures. Enhanced conservation efforts are needed to ensure the biodiversity remains protected.”Angria Bank was identified as one of India’s 106 important coastal and marine biodiversity areas by the Wildlife Institute of India. “While helping achieve the Aichi target 11, protecting the submerged bank will act as an insurance against climate change as the area is a carbon sink providing benefits to the entire country,” said Vardhan Patankar, programme head (marine conservation), WCS-India.Marine biologist Deepak Apte, director, Bombay Natural History Society, said, “This is refreshing news about the state’s intent to declare Angria Bank as protected. It was due to marine biologist Sarang Kulkarni’s efforts, who first video-graphed these reefs and prepared base documents in 2010 that drew focus across international platforms. Subsequent expeditions under Mangrove Foundation provided further scientific evidence of the need for its protection.”Historical significanceAs per a proposal prepared by the Maharashtra forest department to protect the bank, the name Angria was derived from Kanhoji Angre, who served as an admiral under Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Considering the strategic location of the bank, the anchoring point was identified as a naval base for the Maratha empire against the Dutch, British and Portuguese. Using this point, Angre ensured never to allow enemy ships to pass the anchoring point and is said to have not a lost a single battle at sea. His name was spelt as ‘Cunhojee Angria’ in British documents, which led to the name of the submerged plateau as Angria Bank. In 1951, the Indian Navy commemorated their naval prowess by naming the Western Naval Command INS Angre in tribute to Kanhoji Angre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-proposes-submerged-plateau-off-malvan-to-be-declared-as-protected-area/story-Z12GaVMR87JVJ0scdmo0zH.html

31-05-2020||Mumbai||Maha fresh norms expected today?||The state government is expected to issue its revised lockdown guidelines on Sunday. An official said the government is going to provide further relaxations in a “gradual and calibrated manner”, but coronavirus cases are bound to go up as this happens. The official added that the state government is moving “cautiously” and relaxations would be given on the degree of “contact” and “essential” nature of the service.Covid-19 hotspot areas such as Mumbai, MMR and Pune are likely to remain under lockdown even as the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Saturday issued guidelines for the phased reopening of activities outside containment zones. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has already indicated that he is not keen to lift curbs in Mumbai, Pune and MMR.The MHA, in its guidelines, has allowed opening up of religious places/places of worship, hotels, restaurants, and other hospitality services, and shopping malls from June 8. The state government has not decided yet, but is unlikely to allow the opening of malls, among others.“We are moving with caution. It is known that cases do surge when relaxations are lifted. We have been preparing for it. Besides that, providing relaxations in curbs would depend on the degree of contact among people, how essential is the service that is being allowed. Mode of transport is also a criteria being looked at, while allowing anything,” said a senior official requesting anonymity. Officials said that there could be some relaxations given in Mumbai, MMR and Pune to restart economic activities, including opening of standalone shops. The state government has already asked the Centre to restart Mumbai suburban train services for essential services providers, including doctors, nurses, healthcare staffers and civic body employees.“So far no decision has been taken, but a majority of the curbs will remain in place in the red zone. However, deliberations are on to allow the opening of standalone shops, allowing morning walk on a trial basis, but if there is crowding, it would be suspended,” a senior bureaucrat said. The government is also considering if private offices can be allowed to resume operation with less staff. However, without public transport, relaxations could not work.Besides that, the state government could remove some of the municipal corporations, excluding municipal corporations of Mumbai, Pune, from the red zone category. Dhule, Solapur, Aurangabad, Malegaon, Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Akola, Amravati and Nagpur cities are in the red zone.Depending on the number of cases rising daily, a particular municipal corporation could be put in non-red zone where economic and industrial activities could commence, officials said. “Like it was done earlier, surrounding areas of Pune were not kept in the red zone as the Covid-19 cases were in control. Secondly, several industries are there in the belt, which have been reopened,” he added.Semi-urban areas and rural areas fall under the non-red zone category, where a chunk of activities has been allowed from May 22. The state government is, however, unlikely to open up inter-district travel as they are seeing a rise in cases in rural areas after travel relaxation from urban areas was provided.Thackeray has directed district authorities to strengthen healthcare infrastructure across as relaxations would lead to an increase in cases. Mumbai, Thane and Pune have been ramping up capacity of beds. “It is expected that once further relaxation is provided, Covid-19 cases would go up. Our top consideration is to look at the extent and acceleration of the spread in the state. We have already started to strengthen the health infrastructure to tackle the surge,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-fresh-norms-expected-today/story-RKGTa3I4XtdBJgznqPvM9M.html
31-05-2020||Mumbai||State hikes petrol and diesel prices by ₹2 each||The Maharashtra government on Saturday decided to charge additional cess of ₹2 per litre each both on petrol and diesel. The new prices will come into effect from June 1. The decision was taken to tide over the financial crisis being faced by the state government after a lockdown was imposed from March 23 to contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.In Mumbai, as on May 30, petrol prices are in the range of ₹76.25 to ₹76.31 per litre, while diesel prices are in the range of ₹66.15 to ₹21 per litre. The state charges cess of ₹8.12 per litre on petrol and ₹1 on diesel. This has been increased to ₹10.12 per litre and ₹3 per litre respectively, said a senior official from finance department.The state government is expecting an increased revenue of ₹3,000 crore in this financial year (₹300 crore a month) from the hike, said the official.The financial crisis has led the state government to declare a 67% cut in its spending for developmental works this fiscal, in view of the estimated revenue losses of more than Rs40,000 crore in March and April 2020, owing to the Covid-19 outbreak.The state, expecting the cumulative losses to be more than Rs50,000 crore in the current fiscal, has also decided to not take up new development schemes and scrap or defer the schemes that can be put on hold. Among other measures, the government has also decided to stop recruitment for government jobs, meaning that recruitment underway for 35,000 posts is unlikely now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-hikes-petrol-and-diesel-prices-by-2-each/story-Jz753Vz40Gqqa7fOzre26N.html

However, celebrations were low-key because of the Covid-19 precautionary measures. instead of a grand parade at the iconic Khetarpal Drill Square, a solemn ceremony was held in Habibulah Hall, the NDAs main auditorium. Only cadets of the passing out course and some members of the faculty attended the event, which was presided over by the Commandant, Lt Gen Asit Mistry. A total of 335 cadets graduated from the academy, including 226 from the Army , 44 from the Navy and 65 from the Air Forc. About 20 cadets from foreign countries were also part of the ceremony.A release from AFPI said many cadets who trained at the institute held senior appointments in the passing out course, including academy cadet Adjutant Loveneet Singh, battalion cadet Captain Rajdeep Singh and squadron cadet Captain Arunav Laroiya. They were part of the 5th AFPI Course (2016 – 17). Adjutant Loveneet Singh was awarded the Commandant’s medal for dedication to duty and Captain Arunav Laroiya was awarded the commandant’s medal for exceptional leadership.Loveneet Singh’s father Rupinder Singh is a farmer who belongs to Jalalabad East in Dharamkot tehsil and Laroiya’s father is assistant general manager (IT) from Patiala. Rajdeep Singh’s parents are teachers from Nangli village in Baba Bakala tehsil.Given the circumstances the cadets, instead of taking leave as per regular routine, will be proceeding to their respective service academies shortly.Cadets in the 8th AFPI Course completed their training at the Institute in April this year and were scheduled to join NDA in July, but the commencement of the next NDA course is likely to be delayed because of non-completion of all SSB interviews so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/18-afpi-cadets-pass-out-of-nda/story-G2ktttCA4WByx16vkNad4L.html

Another care-taker of the temple, Shyamsingh Thakur, was also sleeping in the temple premises. The three accused – Anil Bhujad, his brother Sunil and a man identified as Karela – entered the temple and assaulted Saraswati and Thakur.“As Saraswati was grievously injured in the attack and Thakur rushed outside the premises to call for help, the three accused took away the donation box containing ₹6,800, a copper urn and other valuables from the temple. They also shattered the window panes of the temple,” said a Virar police officer.The police registered a case under sections 394 (injury while robbery) and 427 (mischief) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and arrested the three men on Thursday evening, based on the description given by the Saraswati and Thakur.

Rao was arrested in 2018 in connection with the Elgar Parishad case.On Thursday evening, Rao was rushed to Sir JJ Hospital from Taloja jail after he fell unconscious. His family, however, was informed about his hospitalisation on Friday evening, and hence could approach the special court only on Saturday. In the plea filed through lawyers Nilesh Ukey and Arif Siddiqui, the accused’s family sought direction to the hospital to give Rao’s detailed medical report.Rao earlier moved a plea for an interim bail, following which the court asked Taloja prison authorities to provide the accused’s medical report. However, on Thursday when the case came up for hearing, the prison authorities failed to submit the report, after which the court sent them a reminder to submit the report and scheduled the hearing on June 2. Meanwhile on Saturday, Rao’s wife P Hemalatha released a statement, in which she urged the Centre and the Maharashtra and Telangana governments to provide exact details of her husband’s health condition. She also urged the three governments to release her ailing husband on bail immediately owing to his health condition. “Through the local Chikkadapalli police in Hyderabad, we came to know around 8.30pm on Friday that Varavara Rao’s health condition was precarious and he was moved to Sir JJ Hospital, Mumbai from Taloja jail. They [Telangana Police] told us that they got that one sentence information from Pune Police and did not know any further details,” read her statement.Hemalatha pleaded to the authorities to conduct a proper medical check-up of her husband and permit video conferencing with him to know his actual health condition. “I am not in a position to travel to Mumbai as I am 72 and not in good health and have been under severe stress for the past 12-14 hours in particular and 18 months in general,” her statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-court-asks-mumbai-hospital-to-submit-health-report-of-varavara-rao/story-pnLO4Sy6anpNsPxEp93C5L.html

This is the first coronavirus death of an employee reported in the Thane civic body. The tax inspector was posted at quarantine centres in Bhayandar Pada on Ghodbunder Road and contracted the virus from the area, TMC officials said. On May 18, he was tested positive and admitted to Horizon Prime Hospital. “The assistant tax inspector was discharged from the hospital last week after recovery. But he was admitted again after two days, as his health deteriorated. He also suffered from diabetes, hypertension and asthma and was on ventilator. His wife and two sons were also hospitalised after being tested positive, but they recovered after treatment,” said Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner of TMC. The assistant tax inspector’s colleague from Majiwada Manpada ward said he was looking forward to retirement. “He was proficient in his work and achieved 108% target of tax collection. This year too, he was aiming to meet a target of 102%. He was among the list of 64 employees who were to retire today and was looking forward to life after retirement. We never thought he will not make it,” his colleague said. The Municipal Labour Union alleged that most staffers above 55 years are on Covid duty despite suffering from comorbidities. “The assistant tax inspector reached retirement age and had several health conditions. Why was he then posted at a quarantine centre despite being in the high-risk category?” Ravi Rao, president of union said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-civic-body-staffer-dies-of-covid-19-on-the-day-he-was-to-retire/story-ozehoW3v6wyzvKpKucGn2J.html
31-05-2020||Mumbai||67% drop in NO2, 39% in particulate matter during three phases of lockdown||A 67% drop in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels while a 39% drop for particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) were recorded during three phases of the lockdown in the city as compared to the same period in 2019, states an analysis by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).The three phases, first period from March 25 to April 14, second from April 15 to May 3, and the third from May 4 to 17, saw maximum percentage decline for NO2 during the first two weeks (72.4%). PM2.5 levels fell maximum during lockdown 2.0 by (50.3%). PM10 also saw maximum reduction during the second phase by 52.6%. However, there was a lower percentage reduction in all three pollutants NO2 (59.5%), PM2.5 (32.3%), and PM10 (24.6%) during lockdown 3.0, as compared to levels during the same period in 2019.Nitrogen dioxide is a toxic gas that contributes to aerosol formation that can worsen respiratory conditions formed from the burning of coal, oil, and vehicular emissions. PM2.5 is breathable particulate matter which is 2.5 microns in size or smaller while PM10 are larger particles. Both can cause health complications.“The analysis shows us that the reduction percentage kept declining with time because values were getting saturated at the lowest possible natural levels or background levels,” said Gufran Beig, director, SAFAR. “This means that during the first phase maximum reduction in vehicular emission allowed NO2 levels to fall to its lowest but reduction in PM levels fell by around 34% because they are secondary pollutants from vehicular emissions. However, by the second phase, NO2 gradually declined from the background level while PM levels fell to its lowest. By the third, percentage reduction gradually declined as base levels for both pollutants were reached in previous phases.”On comparing drop in pollutant percentages with other cities, Pune showed a maximum decline in NO2 followed by Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Delhi, while PM decline was maximum in Ahmedabad, Delhi, followed by Mumbai and Pune. “The impact of unseasonal showers helped reduced pollutant concentrations for cities like Pune and Delhi during lockdown 3.0,” added Beig.While the analysis of the fourth lockdown 4.0 is being compiled by his team, Beig added that with pre-monsoon showers predicted for Mumbai next week, low pollution levels are expected to maintain. “The impact on monsoon will show a further decline and how much more background pollutant levels can fall during lockdown 5.0,” said Beig.PM concentration, year’s lowest on SaturdayThe concentration of PM2.5 was the lowest this year, at 15 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3), on Saturday morning which increased to 22 µg/m3 by the evening. SAFAR said the drop was due to a light drizzle between Friday night and Saturday morning. The World Health Organization (WHO) PM2.5 safe standard for 24 hours is 25 µg/m3, while the national safe standard is 60 µg/m3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/67-drop-in-no2-39-in-particulate-matter-during-three-phases-of-lockdown/story-t9daEKUvZMZcKKiGuvOsTJ.html

31-05-2020||Mumbai||CM: Hold final-year exams ensuring no one gets infected||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray said on Saturday that final-year university exams should be conducted while ensuring not a single student is infected of Covid-19. However, the dates of the examination have not been decided yet. Thackeray also directed the vice-chancellors and officials to explore other options including an alternative where students opt for grades based on the previous semester’s performance or take the examination. A legal opinion will be sought in this matter.“University examinations should be held ensuring not a single student gets infected by coronavirus. The worries of students and parents should be ended by determining the exact method of examination and by finalising the timetable,” Thackeray said, as per the statement from the chief minister’s office (CMO).The decision was taken in the meeting between the CM, higher and technical education minister Uday Samant and vice-chancellors of all state universities on Saturday via video-conferencing.“It was also discussed whether students should be given an option to choose if they wish to give the final-year exam or they want to opt for grades based on the earlier semesters’ performance. A legal opinion will be sought on it,” a Mantralaya official said.The vice-chancellors and Samant are divided over the issue after the minister wrote to the University Grants Commission (UGC) seeking to cancel final-year exam. Following which, Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari wrote to the CM objecting to the move and directed him to resolve the issue. There are around eight lakh final-year students in the state, and 1.5 lakh are from University of Mumbai (MU).The final-year examination had become a flashpoint between the state government and the Governor. Koshyari had asked Thackeray to issue suitable instructions as not conducting final-year exams would be in violation of UGC guidelines and the provisions of the Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016. Shiv Sena’s youth wing, Yuva Sena, headed by Aaditya Thackeray, had demanded that exams should be cancelled while BJP-backed Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) was pressing the Governor to hold the exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-hold-final-year-exams-ensuring-no-one-gets-infected/story-JtIp392Qd1hfhOvlLLi7sO.html
31-05-2020||Mumbai||23-year-old woman moves HC to abort 24-week foetus||A 23-year-old unmarried woman from Ratnagiri district has moved the Bombay high court (HC) seeking termination of her 24-week pregnancy that resulted from a consensual relationship.Acting on her plea, a bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice NR Borkar on Friday directed the civil surgeon, Ratnagiri to set up a board consisting of doctors qualified and suitable to give an opinion as envisaged under section 3 of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971.The woman has been ordered to appear before the board on May 30, following which the board has been directed to submit its report to the HC by June 1. The woman’s petition will come up for further hearing on June 2.The woman moved the HC seeking permission to medically terminate her advanced pregnancy contending that “being an unmarried single woman delivering the child will be a social stigma and she cannot carry on the pregnancy and raise the child”.Her counsel, advocate Harshad Bhadbhade pointed out that the woman became aware that she was pregnant only on May 20. The pregnancy was the outcome of a consensual relationship with a man, from whom the 23-year-old has since separated.Bhadbhade submitted even such factual situation was covered under the MTP Act, 1971 and necessary direction allowing termination of the pregnancies advanced beyond the statutory limit of 20 weeks can be issued even in such cases.Section 3 of the MTP Act allows medical termination of a pregnancy with a gestation of 12 to 20 weeks, only if at least two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion, formed in good faith, that continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury physical or mental health; or there is a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.Explanation to the section clarifies that where the pregnancy is alleged to have been caused by rape or it occurs as a result of failure of any family planning device or method, the anguish caused by such unwanted pregnancy may be presumed to constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman, and thus permits MTP in these two additional categories.MTP of pregnancies advanced beyond the statutory limit of 20 weeks are done only on orders of the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/23-year-old-woman-moves-hc-to-abort-24-week-foetus/story-5sFHyVglgTNzRbK9tPKwDJ.html

The coronavirus situation has lifted their safety resolve a notch higher. Three staff of Pune fire brigade have been infected with Covid-19 while on duty, and they are willing to resume work after recovery. Fireman Anup Sable, 50, was the first to be contracted by the virus while carrying out his responsibilities as a driver. He was tested positive on May 5, and will resume duty on June 15 after the mandatory home quarantine. Sable lives near Tadiwala road, one of the hotspots in the city. “We are trained to put our lives at risk to safeguard residents, be it fire or an unprecedented situation like Covid-19,” he said. Prashant Ranpise, Pune chief fire officer, said, “Firemen are also Covid warriors. Instead of fire or disasters, we are now fighting coronavirus. Our routine work has been replaced with spraying disinfectants and catering to the needs of the civic body and the city to contain the spread of the virus. Unfortunately in this process, my men are also exposed to the virus. Till date, about three of our staff have been infected, including a driver, a senior staffer and a fireman. The driver has recovered and the other two are in quarantine centres.” Sable, who has been working in Pune fire brigade for over 24 years, said that he faces social boycott post-recovery. “People walk away from me when they see me on the housing colony premises as there is a general fear among public over the virus spread. I am eager to resume duty and serve people.” Sable’s medical expense was covered by Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) insurance, but he had to pay for preliminary and confirmation tests.Sable visited a private hospital when he experienced fever, cough and breathlessness, the first symptoms of Covid-19, and he was advised to take antibiotics. When his medical conditions did not improve, he got himself tested for Covid-19 at another private hospital and the tests came positive on May 5.“I immediately called my wife (47) and daughter (20) to get themselves admitted too and they also turned positive. I was on duty on May 1, a day before I got the symptoms. As it had rained heavily, a tree collapse was reported and I went with team to clear the area. I also visited Naidu hospital for personal work. I do not know how or where I got infected and there is no point in blaming anyone. Fortunately, I and my family underwent treatment and are cured.”The family of three returned home after completing their treatment and are since then in home quarantine. Sable said, “Although I have tested negative in the second confirmation tests before discharge, I feel a bit weak. I also have diabetes and high blood pressure and so will take proper rest before resuming duty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-fireman-fights-covid-on-fire-with-confidence-to-resume-duty/story-rvkGTvuo0JuAXlVD7a1IdK.html

31-05-2020||Pune||Navale hospital staff in Pune protests for salary dues of 6 months, management assures dues will be cleared||At least 450 staff members of Kashibai Navale Hospital and Medical College, in Narhe, on Saturday protested outside the hospital over non-payment of salary from December last year.Currently, the hospital has Covid-19 (coronavirus) patients mostly from rural Pune.One of the protesters, who works in the nursing department of the hospital from the past four years on condition of anonymity, said, “We have been waiting for the management to settle our dues from the past six months now. We want a clear assurance from Maruti Navale sir (chairperson of Sinhgad institutes) on this as the management is not giving any clear answers.”“Our hospital is a Covid-19 isolation centre and so only the staff which is not involved in the treatment of the patients is protesting,” she added.Navale hospital is attached to Kashibai Navale Medical College and is run by Sinhgad Technical Education Society (STES). Founded by Navale, STES has been facing financial troubles for the past two years.Despite multiple attempts, the hospital dean Dr Shalini Sardesai, the dean of the college and MN Navale chairperson of Sinhgad institutes could not be reached for comments. The protestor added, “While talking to us in the afternoon Navale sir clearly said that the trust has no money to pay us unless the students pay their dues. It has become very difficult for us to continue with our routine expenditure without salaries for six months.”“Later in the evening after an internal meeting, the management has now assured us that they will release part payment before June 30 and the remaining before August 30. We will resume work from Monday as we do not want the patients to suffer,” the protestor said.Dr Ramchandra Hankare, chief health officer, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said, “It is a private hospital and only the management can answer for the salary dues as it is an internal matter. As far as Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act (MESMA) 2006 is concerned the hospital has to impose it on their staff, we as administrators cannot do it.” The Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act (MESMA) 2006 was implemented on May 29 in Pune for doctors and nurses in private hospitals. Consequently, the administration has the power to take action against doctors and nurses who refuse to treat COVID-19 patients, as well as those who do not attend medical services. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune Zilla Parishad, said, “As soon as I heard about the protest, I did check if there are any pending bills, but I found that there are no pending bills with us under any government schemes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navale-hospital-staff-protests-for-salary-dues-of-6-months-management-assures-dues-will-be-cleared/story-DPQV8ghppEb7lRW6C3wBWN.html

31-05-2020||Pune||Parents anxious about plan to reopen schools in Pune||After Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister, Ajit Pawar, on Friday, made it clear that schools will not reopen in June, but govt is considering reopening them in July, teachers and parents want to further delay the reopening of schools.Concesso Britto a teacher at Bishop’s School ( Mohammadwadi ) said, “ Parents will not send their kids till the contagion is over. There are more than 40 students in a class. It is essential to postpone the reopening of schools as it is risky for students, teachers and parents.”Clarence D’Souza, a teacher from a school in Salunke Vihar said “ The management had called us to the school to discuss about reopening but we categorically told them that the parents and teachers think that the contagion is far from over and there is a serious risk to the lives of the students. The classrooms are usually crowded and social distancing is mandatory. Similarly, recesses will bring the students together, leading to violation of social distancing norms. When adults are violating social distancing norms, then school students are younger and not mature enough to understand the dangers of intermingling. We have communicated that the schools can start in either August or later, once the epidemic starts receding completely from the city.”Sabeeha Shaikh, a parent from Kondhwa said, “I am extremely concerned about schools reopening. What is the guarantee of my child’s safety and I am also worried about arrangements at school. I think life is far more important than starting the school. We are ready to wait for the next six months rather than endangering the lives of our children,” she said.Manjushree Patil, a parent from Lohegaon said, “We have been keeping a close tab on the situation. The schools must not reopen in July as the virus is still spreading in the city and we fear that our child are at risk. The government must send clear guidelines to the school and inform the parents about what it plans to do with the academic session.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/parents-anxious-over-plan-to-reopen-schools-in-july/story-zwBmXyj1UUgZjyCZetgFoL.html
31-05-2020||Delhi||17 more occupants of shelter near AIIMS test positive for Covid-19||Seventeen occupants of a shelter near the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Friday, more than a week after 21 from the same shelter were found to have the contagious infection. The shelter houses outstation patients who visit the national capital to be treated at the premier institute, as well as their caretakers and relatives. Officials said the infections in the shelter could be traced to two kidney patients who tested positive on May 18. Friday’s positive cases take the total number of Covid-19 cases in the shelter to 40.All of the occupants who tested positive on Friday were quarantined contacts of the 21 who tested positive on May 21.Apart from the 17, an occupant of another shelter that also houses outstation AIIMS patients also tested positive. Both shelters are run by the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB).District magistrate (south) BM Mishra, said, “All the 18 occupants tested positive on Friday and were shifted to AIIMS Jhajjar quarantine facility. We requested the AIIMS authorities to admit these occupants to the hospital here, but they preferred to send them to Jhajjar.”Mishra added that at the shelter near AIIMS where 17 tested positive, around 35 remaining occupants have been put under in-situ quarantine. Samples of all the other occupants of the temporary shelter where one person tested positive were collected on Saturday to test for Covid-19.A senior district official, who asked not to be named, said, “Initially after the 21 cases were reported from here, we requested the shelter authorities to move the remaining occupants out to nearby schools, but they refused. The shelter home should have been cleared and sanitised for a few days.”However, DUSIB officials refuted the claim.“It is the district authorities who decide which set of people will be put in quarantine, and where. We did not get any such request to move occupants out from the shelter. We have been sanitising the shelters regularly and have also fixed minor issues like low water supply,” said a senior DUSIB official, who did not wish to be named.The Delhi high court in an order this week had asked the Delhi government, DUSIB and AIIMS authorities to improve their coordination in such cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/17-more-occupants-of-shelter-near-aiims-test-covid-ve/story-8RGmhd9yB8CZ4SnqpWXi8K.html
31-05-2020||Delhi||Lockdown 5.0: Delhi-specific relaxations likely today after high-level meet||With the nation entering the fifth phase of the lockdown on June 1 (Monday), malls and less crowded places of worship in Delhi are likely to open from June 8. The Delhi government on Saturday, however, remained undecided on allowing restaurants and hotels to reopen for full-fledged business. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has called a meeting of top officials on Sunday to iron out Delhi’s lockdown rules for phase 5. Since activities allowed under “Unlock 1” plan of the Centre will come into effect only from June 8, the Delhi government is likely to state that “status quo” be maintained until then. This means that the current rules and relaxations may continue till June 8.“The Central government has issued a basic framework for unlocking more services and utilities. The Centre has given the power to the states/union territories to enforce stricter rules, if needed, without diluting that framework. So, Delhi will issue a nuanced order for the city after detailed deliberations with officials. A call will be taken on Sunday on issues such as opening of malls on an alternate basis or fully, allowing dine-in service in restaurants, and opening of hotels, salons and spas, among others,” a Delhi government spokesperson said. Earlier in the day, Kejriwal while addressing a digital press conference had said the city cannot remain under a permanent lockdown. “We cannot engage in a permanent lockdown. No one can predict whether the coronavirus will go away if the timeline of the lockdown is increased by a month or more. We have to learn to live with the virus and we have to arrange for everything required to treat Covid-19 cases,” he said. After the Centre’s order, a senior government official said the 122 containment zones in Delhi will get no relaxation till June 30. But despite the Centre’s order, confusion prevailed over interstate movement of people, which has been a major pain point for thousands travelling between Delhi and neighbouring cities of Noida, Gurugram, Faridabad and Ghaziabad.“The Centre in one clause said no pass/permission is required for interstate or intrastate movement. But the second clause says that a state can regulate movement of people to safeguard public health, which means states will still have the power to seal borders if they feel a need to continue doing so,” a senior revenue department official said. The things/activities that will not start or open in the capital in the fifth phase are schools, colleges and other educational and training institutions. A state education department official said the government will hold more consultations with parents, teachers and other stakeholders with regard to opening of educational institutions -- a decision that will have to be taken by July, according to Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) guidelines. The Delhi Metro too will remain shut for now, according to MHA guidelines. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) tweeted saying: “In light of the guidelines issued by the government, Metro services will remain closed for commuters until further notice.”All public transport, expect the Metro, are operating with restrictions in the national capital. All offices, industries and standalone shops are allowed to open. All markets and shopping complexes are operating on an odd-even basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-specific-relaxations-likely-on-sunday-after-high-level-meeting/story-MRA3AulSxBKHjlUGj9fGeI.html
31-05-2020||City||HT Chandigarh debate: Don’t make patients pay for Covid-19 safety measures||Recent reports of non-Covid-19 patients in private hospitals being billed anything between Rs 1,800 to Rs 5,000 for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE kits) and Rs 50 for sanitisers used by health workers treating them indicates how such hospitals are prioritising profits above all else during a pandemic.A hospital in Panchkula recently billed a woman Rs18,000 for PPE kits of seven health workers attending to the birth of her child, including two PPE kits for the infant.When asked to comment on the matter, a hospital spokesperson not wishing to be named, said, “We are following Haryana health department guidelines and are charging as per the guidelines and not charging unnecessarily.”A Chandigarh resident too recently protested when he was charged Rs 50 for a sanitiser at a private hospital. When questioned, the doctor present confirmed the costs and added that Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000 was also being charged for PPE kits.He said costs of sanitising the hospital and other safety measures meant increased expenses at a time when fewer patients were coming in.Another hospital in Mohali charged a patient Rs 4,200 for a PPE kit from a patient undergoing medical intervention for a kidney ailment.Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur told Hindustan Times recently that an order had been issued on overcharging for PPE kits in certain hospitals. It stated that irrational usage and overcharging for PPE kits had been observed in certain private hospitals, adding unnecessary burden to the patients. “A serious note of this is being taken and all private hospitals are directed to use PPEs as per guidelines already issued. Cost of these if passed on to the patient should be justified and not unnecessarily included in the bill,” she added.The order also reads that any such complaints by the patients will be viewed seriously and appropriate action would be taken.INFLATED COSTSShould patients pay for Covid-19 safety measures?Why do private hospitals expect patients to pay for PPE kits used by health workers?

31-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi four steps ahead of the virus, will have 9,500 beds ready by June 5, says CM Arvind Kejriwal||Delhi is several steps ahead of the coronavirus disease and by June 5, will have in place 9,500 hospital beds for Covid-19 patients, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday as the national capital reported 1,163 new cases of the infection, crossing the threshold of 1,000 for the third day in a row.As on Saturday, the national Capital had 18,549 Covid cases of which 10,058 were active cases. As many as 8,075 people have recovered and 416 people have died of the disease. Delhi has recorded a two-fold increase in Covid cases since May 14, a trend that is worrying, Kejriwal conceded. He urged residents of the city not to panic because a a majority of the patients are either asymptomatic or show mild symptoms like cough, cold and fever. The chief minister said most such patients were recovering from the disease in their homes and had not admitted themselves in hospitals — with some not even needing any medication.“Being the chief minister of the people of Delhi, I want to assure you that we are four steps ahead of Covid-19, and are making arrangements way more than what is required for Delhi to fight the virus,” he said.The chief minister held out an assurance that there was no shortage of hospital beds for Covid-19 patients and as of Saturday, as many as 4,500 beds were vacant.“From the 4,500 beds we had last week, the government has now arranged a total of 6,600 beds for the treatment of Covid patients, out of which only 2,100 are occupied. In just a week, we arranged 2,100 beds. By June 5, Delhi will increase its bed capacity to 9,500 beds. We are even taking over hotels, where oxygen concentrators and beds are being arranged by hospitals,” Kejriwal said.For the first time, the government on Friday had notified five hotels to be fully used as “extended Covid hospitals” for patients with moderate symptoms on a payment basis, adding 1,000 beds. It also designated Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital in Ashok Vihar-IV, Wazirpur and Satyawadi Raja Harish Chandra Hospital in Narela as dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, increasing the number of beds in Delhi by another 400. GTB Hospital was asked to earmark 500 more beds for Covid patients. On Saturday, the government asked GTB Hospital — having a capacity of 1,500 beds — to turn into a dedicated Covid hospital by June 2. In Saturday’s digital press briefing, the chief minister said the government will launch a dedicated mobile application and a website for people to check the availability of Covid-19 beds and ventilators in hospitals.“Even though the health infrastructure in Delhi for Covid is fairly adequate for now, family members of patients are still facing difficulty and confusion remains regarding where to take a person for treatment. For the convenience of the people, we are developing an app that will be launched on Monday<’ the chief minister said. “The app will show the data and status of beds and ventilators available in each hospital in Delhi. People who do not use smartphones can access this information on a website that is also being created. Besides, this information will also be available on the government’s 1031 helpline,” he said. Senior officials in the health department said the number of Covid beds in Delhi government hospitals will be increased to 4,600 by next Friday (June 5) from around 3,830 beds as of Saturday. Gauging the high demand among families for private hospitals, the government is also augmenting the number of beds in private facilities. The number of beds in private hospitals as of Saturday was 2,677 compared to only 677 last week. This will increase to 3,677 by June 5. Kejriwal urged people to consider opting for government hospitals as far as possible. “A lot of people want to be treated in private hospitals. But just like our government schools, even Delhi government hospitals will provide you with the best of facilities. I am assuring you this,” he said. According to data available with the Delhi government, Covid cases in Delhi have spiked since the lockdown was significantly relaxed on May 18. Now all modes of public transport, except the metro, industries, offices, shops are allowed to operate.Kejriwal also appealed to the people to not share malicious and unverified content on social media. “Some people create, post, and share videos for petty and dirty politics,” he said, citing two videos that he said had been falsely passed off as footage of Delhi government hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-four-steps-ahead-of-the-virus-will-have-9-500-beds-ready-by-june-5-says-kejriwal/story-In2AA3I7jEGdWRn3oOC37L.html
31-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi government fixes timeline for disposal of Covid-19 bodies||The Delhi government on Saturday directed Covid-designated hospitals in the city to arrange a funeral within 38 hours of a person dying of the infectious disease, to prevent bodies piling up in mortuariesThe order, issued by Delhi’s health secretary Padmini Singla, states that the hospital has to send the body of the Covid-19 patient or of those suspected to have the infection to the mortuary within two hours of the death. The family must contact the mortuary within 12 hours, after which the hospital has to arrange a cremation or burial within 24 hours, in consultation with the family.The order comes days after HT reported that bodies were piling up inside the Lok Nayak hospital mortuary. On Tuesday, there were 108 bodies in the mortuary — 80 in storage racks and 28 on the floor.The Delhi government on Friday also told the Delhi high court that they had taken urgent steps to ensure there was no delay in the disposal of the bodies of persons who died of Covid-19 or were suspected to have died of the disease.As per the new guidelines for the disposal of Covid-19 bodies, if the family does not contact the mortuary within 12 hours, an intimation will be sent through the area station head officer (SHO) about the date, time, and place of the funeral, in consultation with the area municipal corporation to ensure that the family attend. The delivery of this intimation has to happen within 12 hours of receiving the message from the hospital. This date and time of the funeral has to be fixed in such a manner that the family gets at least 24 hours intimation.So far, Delhi has recorded 416 Covid-19 deaths.In case of abandoned or unidentified dead bodies, the order states that the Delhi Police has to complete all legal formalities within 72 hours, and the body has to be disposed of in another 24 hours.For those whose address is outside Delhi, the medical director of the hospital has to send a message to the resident commissioner of the state or Union Territory, who will be asked to respond within 48 hours. If no reply is received, the body will be “cremated” in the next 24 hours, the order states.The responsibility of timely disposal of dead bodies will lie with the medical director of the hospital where the person died, or where they were brought dead. The respective municipal corporation will help make arrangements for all such burial or cremation, the order states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-government-fixes-timeline-for-disposal-of-covid-19-bodies/story-UvP0K8bwqAOl2f4F1laaiK.html
31-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s largest wholesale medicine market Bhagirath Palace shut till June 4||Delhi’s largest wholesale market for medicines, Bhagirath Palace in Chandni Chowk, has been shut till June 4 after at least 12 people tested positive for Covid-19 from the area in the last 10 days.Traders said that on Saturday, one block of the market — comprising around 50 shops — was shut. The remaining market will be closed from Sunday onwards till June 4. Ashish Grover, a trader in the market and general secretary of Delhi Drug Dealers Association, said, “There are nine to ten blocks in the market area. Today (Saturday), we have closed one block of the market from where five Covid-19 positive cases were reported in the last 2-3 days. The market will remain entirely closed from Monday till June 4, so that it can be properly sanitised and the virus spread can be stemmed. On Sunday, the market anyway remains closed. In total 12 cases have been reported from the market since May 22.” He added that two Covid-19 patients are being treated at hospitals, while the rest are in home isolation. According to various traders’ associations, Bhagirath Palace has been essential in the capital’s war against Covid-19, being the state’s largest wholesale market for medicines. It was open even during the lockdown period because the shops were listed under essential services. The market in Chandi Chowk is located between Lal Quila (Red Fort) and Chandni Chowk metro stations. It has around 570 shops, where more than 2,500-3,000 people work. The wholesale market is surrounded by another wholesale market where surgical goods and electrical items are sold.Grover said that Bhagirath Palace was a very congested market comprising narrow lanes, so social distancing was not entirely possible. However, he said that despite taking all other necessary precautions — like compulsory wearing of masks and gloves — the number of Covid-19 cases has increased in past 10 days. Hence, the traders were “terrified” and opted to shut down the market for a few daysDistrict administration officials said that traders have told them about the about closure of the market and rising Covid-19 cases. They said that the market will be sanitised completely. Traders at the market have assured that the medical supplies in the city will not be hit. “Visitors come to the market from different parts of the city and even many traders do not reside in Central Delhi. So it is very hard to track from where the disease is coming. We will get the market sanitised thoroughly,” a district administration official said.The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) had also requested lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to give immediate directions to authorities to sanitise all markets across the city after a number of cases started emerging from Bhagirath Palace. Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general CAIT, said that markets and traders cannot be left at the mercy of God and authorities should properly sanitise markets.“Since markets are places where heavy footfall of people is always expected, the sanitisation process is all the more necessary. The CAIT has urged Delhi LG to convene a joint meeting of traders with heads of different agencies in Delhi and to chalk out a collaborative strategy for sanitisation, upkeeping and maintaining safety measures, as directed by the government in every market of Delhi,” Khandelwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-largest-wholesale-medicine-market-bhagirath-palace-shut-till-june-4/story-WAbEDj7qec8np0jT5AVhZL.html
31-05-2020||Delhi||Amid protest, Delhi University announces it will hold online open book exams for final year undergraduate students||Amid strong opposition from scores of students and teachers, Delhi University (DU) late Friday confirmed the tentative dates for the final year undergraduate exams and said they will be conducted online in the ‘open book format (OBF)’.The exams are tentatively scheduled to begin from July 1 for 2.4 lakh final year students, including those enrolled with the SoL and Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board.The online exams will be of three hours each – two hours for answering questions and an hour extra for downloading the question paper from an online portal, and once done, for scanning and uploading the answer sheets. The question paper will have six questions; students will be asked to attempt four. Additional time and assistance will be given to persons with disabilities. The exams will be held in three shifts a day for different courses and would test the understanding and analytical skills of students.For many like Mohit (21), a final year BA (prog) student at Delhi University’s School of Open Learning (SoL), the decision is bad news. Mohit (who goes by a single name) used to work as a laundry person before the nationwide lockdown rendered him jobless. He lives with his family of four in a one-room house in north-west Delhi’s Sangam Park. He has not been able to attend a single online class over the last two months due to poor internet connectivity in his locality and for want of space in his house. “We have been struggling to survive without work amid the lockdown. I take laundry contracts from hostels and paying guest students and since all of them have left town post-lockdown, I have no work. It’s tough enough for me to give exams in the normal format, let alone online. We just have one mobile phone at home; one that is very old and very slow,” he said.Hundreds of students living in remote areas and in states with poor internet connectivity have been opposing online exams. Ever since it came to fore a few weeks ago that the university was considering holding exams online, students have held online protests, ran Twitter campaigns, and took part in hunger strikes at home to protest the move. Three students have also filed a petition before the Delhi high court challenging the open book online examinations.Several students said they could not even submit online practical assignments during a recently held exam due to the poor internet connectivity. A final year Botany (Hon) student at Daulat Ram College, who lives in a village in Dibrugarh, Assam, said, “We recently had our online practical exams and it was horrible. I was standing on my terrace all drenched in sweat in the middle of the day trying to upload my PDF on time. The allotted time got over and I could not upload it as the file was bulky and the connectivity was poor. My teacher later allowed me to send it over email. It took me hours to do even that.”For many students, even internet connectivity is a secondary issue, the primary being that they don’t have any gadgets. Madhavi, a third-year student of an off-campus college and resident of Jharkhand’s Ramgarh district, said, “My father is a daily wage earner and I can’t ask him to buy me a smartphone. I had bought one in my first year of college with money I earned by taking tuitions but that phone is not working now -- its screen got damaged. I cannot even check my mails and then on Friday, my friend called and told me about online exams,” she said.Although the university has assured help, several visually challenged students raised concerns about the availability of scribes. “Generally, our college helps us get scribes to write our exams. Now living away so far, I do not know how I will manage to get one in my village,” said a final year visually impaired student of Kamala Nehru College. The University administration on Saturday, however, asked college principals to get applications from students who need information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure for the exams.The notification further states that the university has engaged common service centres (CSCs)— ICT access points created under the ministry of electronics and information technology. “The students can avail of the facility free of cost. There are more than 2 lakh functional CSCs located in all gram panchayats and villages across the country. The information on CSCs will be available on the DU website,” said dean of examinations Vinay Gupta said in the notification. The dean said those who will still not be able to take the exams will be provided a chance to do so after September, once OBE exam results are out.Several teachers said many CSCs in villages don’t have updated technology. Pankaj Garg, a teacher at Rajdhani College, said, “Most of the CSCs mentioned on the website are in a bad shape with no proper connectivity. This decision would adversely affect the economically weak students. If they are unable to take the OBE exams, then they have to wait till after the OBE results. This would delay the declaration of their results and affect future plans.”Rajesh Jha, member of the DU executive council, said DU is trying to experiment with a form of examination that has never been used amid the pandemic crisis. “This switch from one mode of exams to another is in violation of the university rules. Even teachers are confused about how to set the paper,” he said.Seema Das, a member of the DU academic council, said, “The format is very different as questions are set to evaluate the analytical knowledge of students. It requires extensive discussions on topics. We could not even take proper classes because of the lockdown. This format can still be used for a small set of students and not in a set-up like DU.”Despite several attempts, Gupta did not respond to calls and texts for comment. A member of DU’s task force to combat Covid-19 pandemic said, “The administration will have to take some extraordinary measures in this extraordinary situation. We cannot wait for a long time as we will have to start the admission process in August. A chance will be given to those who won’t be able to attend these exams.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/amid-protest-du-announces-it-will-hold-online-open-book-exams-for-final-year-undergrad-students/story-uSgFX3QrQIeeTxCzi4DGlK.html
31-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi PWD asks contractors to estimate cost increase in construction projects||Delhi’s Public Works Department (PWD), which is working on some of the Capital’s most important infrastructure projects, has asked concessionaires to evaluate and estimate cost increases in ongoing projects due to the lockdown, and submit a report in the first week of June. PWD officials said that the tentative increase in the estimated cost of the projects is likely to range between 10% and 12% for the current quarter. Experts have said any potential increase in costs would also likely delay the respective project, because the revised estimates would require government approval.The officials said the cost of construction material has increased due to the nationwide lockdown, in place since March 25 to curb the spread of Covid-19.Hiked duties on diesel and petrol in Delhi also made transporting construction material costlier. With these factors together playing a role in bumping up the cost of the projects substantially, officials said the evaluation exercise will give the department an idea of the “financial health” of the projects.The Delhi government had, on May 5, raised value-added tax (VAT) rates on petrol and fuel.“At present, the duty on petrol and diesel has been increased, so the transportation cost of construction material will also go up. The cost of construction materials such as stone grits, steel, iron, and others have also increased. These will most definitely escalate the cost of infrastructure projects,” a senior PWD official said.The official said stone grits are procured from Rajasthan, but mining is yet to re-start properly in the state due to a shortage of labour, which has made available materials more expensive. “We have asked our concessionaires to evaluate costs and file a report by the first week of June. The average cost escalation of major projects is expected to be around 10% to 12% for the current quarter,” the official said.Another PWD official explained that costs will only escalate in long-term projects, which usually take more than 18 months to complete.“Small-scale projects are unlikely to be affected. Long term projects such as the Barapullah Phase-3 elevated corridor will face the impact of cost escalation,” the official said.He explained that, for instance, the estimated cost of Barapullah Phase-3 project so far is ₹1,260 crore. If a cost escalation of 10% is projected, its revised cost will end up being ₹1,386 crore.The PWD is working on projects such as construction of a 1.2-km tunnel between Purana Qila Road near Mathura Road and Ring Road, which is part of the ITPO Pragati Maidan Redevelopment Project; Barapullah phase-3 elevated corridor; Ashram underpass; flyovers at Seelampur and Shastri Park; and Benito-Juarez Road underpass in south Delhi. Construction at a majority of infrastructure projects was on hold since November last year, when the Supreme Court banned work due to toxic pollution levels in the city.That ban was fully lifted only in February. But work was stopped only weeks later on March 25 when the nationwide lockdown came into force.The Centre had, last month, asked states to allow construction work at important infrastructure projects after April 20, an order that did not extend to Delhi due to the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the Capital. The Delhi government gave its nod to resume construction activities on infrastructure projects on May 3.Sewa Ram, professor at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) said that apart from costly construction materials and high transportation cost, slow pace of work also results in a project’s cost escalating. “Cost escalations also cause hindrances in the progress of the project, because it requires approval from the government which further consumes time. Resource mobilisation will be a big problem for the government as well. In some projects that are yet to start, the government may relook some of the projects or halt them temporarily,” Ram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-pwd-asks-contractors-to-estimate-cost-increase-in-construction-projects/story-2mEntbBC3vfHq6XnD562PP.html
31-05-2020||Delhi||Air India pilot tests Covid-19 positive, rescue flight to Moscow turned around||A special Air India flight that took off from Delhi airport on Saturday morning to bring back Indian citizens stranded in Moscow, under the government’s Vande Bharat initiative, was called back midway when the airline found out that one of the pilots on-board had tested positive for the coronavirus disease, the airlines said in a statement.Air India did not clarify who was responsible for the lapse that allowed the pilot to board the aircraft with 16 other crew members. An internal inquiry is underway, the airline said. All the 16 crew members were quarantined after they flew back, the airline said. Under the government’s Vande Bharat mission, the national airline is flying back Indian citizens stranded abroad because of the suspension of international flights and lockdowns for the Covid-19 crisis. The first phase of Vande Bharat Mission, completed during May 7-16, resulted in the repatriation of 16,716 stranded Indians on 64 flights from a dozen countries. The second phase represents a massive scaling up of the programme, with 429 flights by Air India (311 international flights and 118 feeder flights) from 60 countries. According to the officials at Delhi airport, Saturday’s special flight left Indira Gandhi International Airport at 6.40 am for Moscow to bring back 135 Indians. At around 9.30 am, the pilots were told to return to base. “At the time when pilots were asked to return to Delhi airport they were already flying over Kazakhstan. They had completed around three hours of flight. It took them another three hours to return and the flight landed in Delhi by 12.30 pm,” said an official who requested anonymity. In a statement, Air India said it had to recall the aircraft operating from Delhi to Moscow immediately when it was noticed that one of the cockpit crew had tested positive in a pre-flight Covid-19 test.“On return, immediately after landing all cockpit and cabin crew have been tested and all laid down medical precautions are being taken to ensure their health and safety. All of them have been quarantined. Another aircraft was sent to operate the Vande Bharat flight to bring back Indians from Moscow,” the airline said.The airline’s spokesperson did not respond to a query from HT about the procedure of pre-flight Covid-19 tests for the special flight’s crew members; another query on how the pilot had boarded the aircraft after he tested positive also elicited no response. A second official at the airport, who is aware of the procedure that’s followed, said once a flight ‘s schedule is fixed, all crew meant to fly on that plane undergo a coronavirus disease test a few hours before departure time. “The test results are sent to the authorities at the landing port if they demand {the results}. In some countries, including India, they ask for test results of the arriving crew in any relief flight,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pilot-tests-ve-rescue-flight-to-moscow-turned-around/story-egxgX3ZvVyn7c3mgfOBFTL.html
31-05-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram Police restricts border checks for rush hours on Saturday; curbs to remain in place in Lockdown 5.0||A day after imposing travel restrictions at the Delhi-Gurugram border that led to heavy congestion on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, the police on Saturday somewhat relaxed the checking of vehicles. While the police continued to check for the movement passes during the rush hours, for the rest of the day, however, they only conducted a random check of the vehicles. Meanwhile, although the ministry of home affairs (MHA), on late Saturday evening, allowed for the unrestricted movement of goods and people between states, the Gurugram district administration decided to continue with the present restrictions in view of the public health situation in the state. On Saturday morning, those with movement passes pasted on the front screen of their vehicles were allowed to pass easily unlike Friday when every vehicle was stopped for checking. The checking on Saturday mainly took place between 7.30am and 9.30am and then from 5pm to 7.30pmCommuters who travelled on both Friday and Saturday said that the congestion was far less on Saturday as compared to the previous day. The volume of vehicles on weekends is much lower than it is on the weekdays and the traffic police were also not stopping every vehicles, said the commuters. “On Friday, there was heavy congestion and it took me around 35-40 minutes to cross the border. Even those with passes were being stopped and asked about the destination for which they were headed. Today (Saturday), however, the police were not stopping those with movement passes for questioning and letting them through. The combination of light traffic and a greater leniency on the part of the police resulted less traffic congestion. As such, It took me less than 15 minutes to cross the border,” said Keshav Anand, a resident of Sector 55.A spot visit by the HT team to the expressway revealed that, around 1pm, on the Gurugram to Delhi side of the carriageway, police personnel were checking vehicles for passes in only the extreme left lane while toll operators were checking vehicles in the other three. However, they were only stopping commercial vehicles. On the Delhi to Gurugram carriageway, despite heavy police presence, free movement of vehicles was being allowed only through a single lane.“We do not have adequate manpower to stop and check every single vehicle. Even if we do this for 10-15 minutes, it leads to a kilometre-long pile-up and it takes more than 30-45 minutes for the traffic to return to normalcy. We are thus allowing most vehicles to pass through and are only stopping those that have more than one or two occupants and have vehicle registration number plates that do not belong to either Delhi or Gurugram,” said a police official at the spot.The vigilance at the border was increased on Friday after Haryana home minister Anil Vij directed the main roads as well as internal roads connecting the four districts of the state with Delhi to be sealed, alleging that a bulk of the new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in Haryana were related to Delhi.Gurugram police officials said that there would be no change in the deployment and checking at the borders unless new directions are issued in this regard.“We will continue to have thorough checking at the borders until we receive any new direction from the government stating otherwise. Only those engaged in essential services, and those with movement passes will be allowed to allowed to cross over to Delhi or vice versa,” said Chander Mohan, DCP, traffic. Mohan, however, denied that Gurugram Police were carrying out random checking for most of the day, and said it may have happened momentarily. Restrictions during Lockdown 5.0On Saturday evening, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) issued a fresh set of guidelines on the phased re-opening of activities outside containment areas across India. Although one of the rules stated that there will be ‘unrestricted movement of persons and goods’ between states and within states, a clause to rule stated that a state or a Union Territory could regulate movement based on an assessment of the public health situation. The movement, however, can only be restricted if the details about the restrictions have been publicised well in advance by the local administration. When asked about the movement of goods and persons between Haryana and Delhi, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri said that Gurugram will be operating with this clause. “At present, we will be regulating the movement of people and goods as per the MHA’s enabling clause. It is an NCR-wide decision. Any change in this regard will be initiated depending on the situation following a thorough review of public health with regards to coronavirus,” said Khatri.When asked about the problems faced by the people in the past few days regarding the issuance of movement passes through the SARAL Haryana portal, Khatri said that it is likely the servers are being updated towards the end of the month and hence, people were facing such issues. On Saturday evening, application for movement passes through the portal returned to normalcy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-police-restricts-border-checks-for-rush-hours-curbs-to-remain-in-place-in-lockdown-5-0/story-CWhrLmgJXrxUNfGwscvD7I.html
31-05-2020||City||Tricity buzz: HT Chandigarh reporters’ tracker on all those making, or faking, news amid coronavirus lockdown||JAWAHARPUR LOOKS HEAVENWARDS TO END CORONA CURSEWith 46 Covid-19 cases, Jawaharpur village in Dera Bassi sub division of Mohali district is seeking divine intervention to end its corona curse. From organising havans to akhand path, villagers are trying to appease the Almighty to bring back smiles on the faces of residents. The 200-year-old village became a hotspot and was declared a containment zone. Malkit Singh, the first from the village to test positive, is leading the prayers to rescue the village from such hard times.COVID WARRIOR BABLA GETS DRIVE-PAST SALUTE FROM GRATEFUL RESIDENTSAs parts of Sector 30-B, Chandigarh, turned into a containment zone, local area councillor Devinder Singh Babla played a proactive role in redressing people’s grievances. Residents decided to express their gratitude for his services last Sunday by planning a drive past Babla’s house. While people drove past offering their thanks, Babla could be seen wearing a mask and waving back at them. At the recent House meeting as well, he highlighted how a woman from Sector 30 was supposed to get married on June 5 but couldn’t make preparations due to the lockdown. Municipal corporation commissioner KK Yadav assured him that the authorities will help with the wedding preparations. Now that’s a people’s representative, indeed.UT cop announces home delivery serviceWhen a Chandigarh Police inspector took to Facebook to announce that Swagath, a restaurant in Sector 26, Chandigarh, is open for home deliveries, it left many surprised. The UT administration allowed home delivery by eateries, while relaxing the lockdown. Congratulatory notes poured in but there were a few queries such as: “Are you running this?” A resident sarcastically remarked, “Home delivery bhi police hi karegi? (Will the police now do home delivery also?)” It’s another matter that Chandigarh Police proactively provided food to the needy during the curfew and lockdown since March 23.HAPPY BIRTHDAY ON DUTY, GRP STYLEBirthdays are special and no lockdown can stop the celebrations, even for those on duty. The other day, assistant sub inspector Lakhbir Singh of the Government Railway Police (GRP) was on duty in Mohali, overseeing the return of migrant workers to their native places amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Since he could not go home or get an off on his birthday, GRP deputy superintendent of police Davinder Singh Matharu arranged a cake-cutting ceremony at his office, while the men in khaki, who are like second family, sang the birthday song on the ASI’s special day.POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE, TWO LABS GIVE TWO CORONA RESULTSThe Union Territory health department was caught by surprise when a 91-year-old woman from Sector 15, Chandigarh, tested negative for Covid-19 within hours of testing positive. The laboratory at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, and a private lab gave different results for the woman’s swab samples. Though the private lab authorities, which first confirmed that the woman was infected, has taken one more sample for investigation, the UT health department has said that the PGIMER report, which suggests the woman is not infected, will be treated as final. A senior UT official said: “They can send the samples to John Hopkins but I am sure they will get the same result.”COUNCILLORS MEET ON VIRTUAL TURF VIA VIDEO-CONFERENCEFor the first time, the general House meet of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation was conducted via video conference on Friday. While it mostly went off with them maintaining discipline and speaking only when their turn came, when an argument broke out, it was all noise and all one could hear was the echo of “ek minute mayor madam”. Switching their cameras and microphones off, many councillors just disappeared from the meeting, while one of them appeared to be driving while participating in the video-conference. Managing the camera angle was the toughest job for one of the women councillors. Even after media persons alerted her, all others could see were her lips on the screen.BJP, CONGRESS IN CREDIT WAR OVER PANDEMIC DONATIONSAfter the initial appreciation for the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation in containing coronavirus, Congress and BJP leaders were back to their usual game of one-upmanship. Each party’s members claimed they had done more than their rivals for helping people during the pandemic. The arguments became particularly heated on the issue of donation of PPE kits and sanitisers. MC Commissioner KK Yadav intervened and said, “The MC welcomes donations from both parties. Help as much you want!”SALONS CLOSED IN CHANDIGARH, RESIDENTS HEAD FOR PANCHKULA, MOHALIEven as Punjab and Haryana allowed barber shops to open, the UT administration did not come out with its standard operating procedure (SOP) for opening salons in the city. Sources said senior UT officials want to wait till the end of Lockdown 4.0. Meanwhile, residents made their way to neighbouring Panchkula and Mohali to get groomed after two months of staying home.RELIEF FOR PANJAB UNIVERSITY V-C AS NAHAR GOESThe term of Panjab University dean, students’ welfare (DSW), Emanual Nahar ends on Sunday. Last May, vice-chancellor Raj Kumar was not in favour of extending his term but syndicate members prevailed. Nahar, who is in the rival camp, has been a headache for the vice-chancellor, leading to a controversy that brewed for four months and even saw students locking down Students Centre. The matter went to the Punjab and Haryana high court and PU was pulled up for removing Nahar unceremoniously. Finally, the V-C can heave a sigh of relief.PARENTS LOCK HORNS OVER SCHOOL FEE DURING LOCKDOWN It’s the first time that the tricity of Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali has seen protests by parents outside schools almost every day. Some parents say they don’t want to pay the fee till classes resume after the Covid-19 situation improves, while others say the charges should be minimal. So far, the education department has turned a blind eye to the protests. Education secretary Arun Kumar Gupta and director, school education, Rubinderjit Singh Brar have not commented on the protests.(Contributed by Hillary Victor, Munieshwer A Sagar, Shailee Dogra, Rajanbir Singh, Amanjeet Singh, Ovais Dar and Srishti Jaswal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tricity-buzz-ht-chandigarh-reporters-tracker-on-all-those-making-or-faking-news-amid-coronavirus-lockdown/story-VJjdr4spbnPCD8aB4CrS2L.html
31-05-2020||City||Wildbuzz: Claws of law tighten grip on killers of migratory falcons||The wheels of justice have turned slowly for endangered migratory falcons and resident raptors. The pace gathered momentum last week. In a series of raids and crackdowns on a section of pigeon fanciers of Punjab who were slaughtering raptors such as the Tundra Peregrine falcon, the Punjab Wildlife Preservation wing arrested two fanciers from Sandoha village of Bathinda district and questioned another fancier from Gharuan village near Mohali. The wildlife officials also arrested two youths from village Lahora near Ludhiana, who were in illegal possession of two specimens of the resident raptor, the Black kite.The raids were launched in response to exposé in the Wildbuzz column on April 22, 2018, and May 10, 2020. This writer had furnished brutal ISIS-style videos of raptor slaughter to the highest authorities at the level of the Union ministry of environment and forests, National Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, the Punjab Wildlife Preservation wing and the International Convention on Migratory Species Office, Abu Dhabi, in April 2018 and May 2020. India is a signatory to this Convention on the protection of all raptors. Confirming the crackdown, Punjab principal chief conservator (wildlife), Dr Kuldeep Kumar, told this writer: “We are going to go strictly by the law. Raptors such as falcons enjoy the highest protection under the laws and it is a non-bailable offence. We want to put an end to this practise once and for all. We had earlier launched a sensitisation and awareness campaign in Punjab to get pigeon fanciers not to kill raptors. We aim to also find out to whom the pigeon fanciers have passed on the falcons or sold them after capture, if they did not kill them.” Irked by raptors such as the Shikra, Eurasian Sparrow hawk, and the migratory Tundra Peregrine and Laggar falcons preying on their expensive pigeons, some fanciers captured raptors and made videos that were posted on TikTok and YouTube and went viral on WhatsApp. Some of these latest videos, which draw a huge number of views, ‘likes’ and ‘shares’, show gruesome beheading of the raptors or simply the wrenching off of the falcon’s head by a muscular Punjabi hand. Pigeon fanciers also shoot down falcons and make videos of that illegal act. Rogue pigeon fanciers in other states of India and Pakistan are also believed to indulge in this brutal killing.Acting on a coordinated drive initiated by Dr Kumar, divisional forest officer (DFO), wildlife, at Bathinda, Swarn Singh, traced the pigeon fanciers to Sandoha village who had trapped a falcon from a high tower and then passed it off to someone else. The two videos showing the illegal acts by the Sandoha pigeon fanciers had been sent to the wildlife authorities by this writer in April 2018. “The persons arrested from village Sandoha near Maur are Gurprit Singh Mand and Nirmal Singh Billa. We have asked the Police to trace the person to whom the fanciers passed on the falcon,” Swarn Singh told this writer.A team from the Ropar wildlife division led by DFO, wildife, Monika Yadav and range forest officer, Prem Singh, traced Gurvinder Singh from villager Gharuan, who had put up videos of him wrenching off the head of a falcon. “We have questioned him and taken his statement. He will be produced before the court,” Yadav told this writer. While the pigeon fanciers from Sandhoa village were arrested on the basis of the offending videos, the wildlife wing is yet to initiate the arrest of Gurvinder Singh of Gharuan who had put up a number of videos displaying acts in violation of wildlife protection laws.As part of the crackdown on rogue pigeon fanciers, a team led by DFO, Phillaur, Khushwinder Singh, nabbed two youths of village Lahora near Ludhiana. “Though it does not seem they were pigeon fanciers, they had two Black kites in their possession. We are questioning them and one of them is Gurprit Singh,” Khushwinder Singh told this writer.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wildbuzz-claws-of-law-tighten-grip-on-killers-of-migratory-falcons/story-qmZ6coTVX10r75Tnb6LIBI.html

The woman had posted an advertisement for a sofa and a chair on an online website and she got a call from a person at 7:30pm on Friday who inquired about the furniture she had posted for sale. After the sale was decided upon, the caller said that for payment, he will send a QR code to the woman which he asked her to scan.As soon as she scanned the QR code, Rs 50,000 was deducted from her bank account, according to the complainant. The complainant claims to have called the customer and told him that money was deducted from her account instead of depositing. The caller, then, allegedly sent another QR code which also was scanned by the complainant while hoping for the return of the money lost in the earlier transaction. However, Rs 40,000 was transferred from the complainant’s account after the second scan, according to her complaint. Consequently, the woman realised that she had been cheated and reported it to the local police after a total of Rs 90,000 was deducted from her account.A case under Section 420 (punishment for cheating) of the Indian Penal Code along with Sections 66(c) and 66(d) of Information Technology Act was registered at Wanowrie police station. Police inspector (crime) Saleem Chaus of Wanowrie police station is investigating the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/woman-loses-rs-90-000-in-online-fraud/story-zHYjdeUztVZbiAGnUmDolK.html

The water supply timings are erratic, sometimes starting half-an-hour late, and stopping half-an-hour early. On Saturday also, the water supply remained hit. We are already paying taxes to bring 24-hour water supply to the city. The least the MC can do is ensure water supply timings are fixed.”Preeti Verma, president of the Sector 35-B Bhakra Beas Management Board residents welfare association (RWA), says they have been receiving muddy water for the last four days. “The water supply has become very erratic. On Saturday afternoon, we did not have water supply and had even received muddy water in the morning.” She says she had spoken to the municipal corporation (MC) officials about a week ago, but to no avail. Sudershan Joshi, a member of the Sector 44-C RWA, added that they had been receiving muddy water as well.Chandigarh Residents Associations Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) chairman Hitesh Puri said, “Around two to three days ago, the water supply was clean but now we have started getting muddy water. When we open the taps in the morning, we get around half-a-bucket muddy water.” He added that CRAWFED had written to the MC commissioner to fix issues with the water supply of the city.Taking stock of the situation, MC chief engineer Shailender Singh said, “Around three days ago, we had started an additional motor which had sucked up some mud. We had removed the mud but we will check again if people are still facing this problem.”MC councillor Anil Kumar Dubey, who is the chairman of the water supply committee, added that a meeting has been called on Monday to discuss all complaints regarding water supply in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/muddy-water-supply-irks-residents-in-chandigarh-s-southern-sectors/story-1Sh1XZICAPHapsP9vwKKIN.html

Satpute started organising virtual job fairs and has provided employment to locals from western Maharashtra and Marathwada. Through Job Showcase, Satpute has provided jobs in retail, banking, manufacturing, e-commerce, production and allied sectors. “The industries are facing a severe shortage of manpower due to the mass migration of labour and hence, we have facilitated the recruitment through virtual job fairs where the interviews are conducted through video conferencing by the human resource personnel,” said Satpute.According to Satpute, the job aspirants from the rural areas of the state cannot travel to the city and the metropolitan centres for interviews. so digital technology came in handy for direct interviews and detailed discussion on the job profile. Interviews are held and a decision is taken with immediate effect. At least 100 candidates were selected from Karjat –Jamkhed assembly segment represented by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA Rohit Pawar during the lockdown period. Similarly, 40 candidates were chosen from Barshi in Solapur district where former inspector Bhausaheb Andhalkar supported the initiative.Beneficiary candidate Dayaneshwar Ulage from Karjat-Jamkhed said, “The initiative has given hopeto the rural youth who are searching for job opportunities during the lockdown and economic crisis. I had applied for Baramati Agro and my process has been completed. I am thankful to our local MLA and virtual job fair for organising the meeting online.”Pawar said, “The initiative is aimed at providing job opportunities to the needy during the tough times. The interviews are conducted online through video conferencing. We have received more than 3,000 applications from various job aspirants so far.”Dilip Pawar, operations head, Yashashwi Group, said, “During the two-month lockdown, companies have been facing serious shortage of manpower. During the lockdown, transport system had shut and it was a challenging task to travel from the district to the company address. Online interviews do not require travel and it is convenient for both the HR and the job aspirant. We have done more than 100 interviews so far and the response has been encouraging.”Satpute said that the extreme shortage of manpower had created opportunities in different sectors where the skilled aspirants can get jobs at decent salaries. “This is how they are seeking out a living and keeping their home and hearth going. We will be extending the facilities to other areas as well,” said Satpute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-entrepreneur-comes-to-rescue-of-unemployed-youth-in-rural-areas/story-9ePgIAekRiSnPppds02PzI.html

When I got to know about the Covid-19 pandemic, I booked a ticket for March 28, but unfortunately, the lockdown was announced and I was stuck here.”However, when things started to get difficult, Bhuyan contacted Sachin Jamage, state executive president of Vande Mataram Sanghatana for help. Right from giving food packets and ration to plane tickets, the Sanghatana has helped her in many ways.“We came in contact with her 10 days ago. We enquired and verified her situation. Accordingly, we first provided her with ration as she was living alone in Chandannagar. We had been in touch with her since then. When the domestic flights resumed, she wanted to go back to Shillong and hence we booked a ticket for her. Her flight was scheduled for 2am on Tuesday. As there is no transport service available, one of our volunteers Sanchit Karve brought his car and we dropped her to Lohegaon airport,” said Jamage.Bhuyan who lost her father four years ago said she went through a financial crunch. “My father worked in the state police department. My mother, sister and I are dependent on my father’s pension for income, so it was difficult for me to survive in Pune. I got the contact of Vande Mataram Sanghatana through social media. Sachin and his team were supportive and were in continuous touch with me during the lockdown days. They provided me with food and helped me get home,” she said.“I had connecting flight from Pune to Delhi and then Delhi to Shillong and finally I reached here on Wednesday. Now I am in quarantine for 14 days after which I will go back home. All credit goes to Sachin and his team for helping people in distress,” said Bhuyan.BOXVolunteers of Vande Mataram Sanghatana have been working tirelessly for the past 69 days to help the needy. As of May 28, they have distributed more than 3.5 lakh food packets, provided 3,500 ration kits to needy and donated 1,000 masks.

Banthia was a top junior player.Training for three hours, fitness for one hour and four hours for academics (business finance), Banthia has a packed schedule. If it was not for the Covid-19 lockdown, the Pune-based player would be in the middle of the US college tennis season. Right now, he is lockded down.How training with the Wake Forest University team helped you as a player?It is currently one of the best phases of my professional career, where I am getting to train in world-class training facilities under top coaches like Tony Bresky and Chris Eaton. It is a completely different environment from what we have in India. Actually there was a myth earlier in our country, that a player going to play US college tennis cannot be a good professional tennis player, but now it has changed. Currently we have many players who are now getting aware of the importance of training in top facilities.What are the benefits of playing US college tennis?You get to train with players from across the globe and the competitive level is very high. I am on a full scholarship programme where my food, stay and academic fees has been taken care of by the university. This helps a lot as you can solely focus on your game and training regularly with players from other countries helps physically.What’s the process for college tennis players?There are three divisions – Division 1, 2 and 3; based on their rankings coaches provide scholarships to players. Division 1 is top where most professional players come from. All the three divisions have different scholarships patterns.What is the structure of the tournaments?There are 150 teams in the Division 1 which are divided into different conferences. Our team, Wake Forest University falls under Atlantic Coast Conference. January to May, is the peak season for the tournaments.Top 16 teams qualify for NCAA Indoor National Championship which takes place in January, while for the NCAA Outdoor National Championship top 32 teams qualify. (Teams with highest points from their conference qualify for these tournaments)In these tournaments one team plays nine matches (three doubles; six singles); doubles match is of one set, while singles is of three. Winning two doubles matches gives you one point, while there is one point each for winning a singles match. Team wins the tie when they earn four points out of seven.These two tournaments are like the Grand Slam of college tennis and one needs to fight hard to winKnow the playerName: Siddhant BanthiaAge: 20Team: Wake Forest University teamCoaches: Tony Bresky, assisted by Chris EatonTitles won by team: 2018 - NCAA champion, Indoor National Champion and ACC conference champions; Ranked No 1; 2019: NCAA runner-up, Indoor national runner-up and ACC conference champions.

31-05-2020||Pune||Coming to US for college tennis? ‘Ensure you’re in shape and not playing catch-up’||Tennis players in India are increasingly getting admitted into US colleges simply to access the training and competition that exists there, both of the highest level. Mark Weaver, coached Rutuja Bhosale at Texas A&M from 2013-2017. Rutuja Bhosale is currently ranked 443 in the Rutuja Bhosale (Women’s Tennis Association) singles and 196 in doubles. Bhoslae played a key role in the Fed Cup where India qualified for the World Group play offs. Bhosale competed for Texas A&M from 2013-2017 and received a degree in University Business Studies. “Bhosale competed at the highest levels in the US and left as an all-American player, which is the highest of honours that one can receive in US college tennis,” says Weaver. Here explains the benefits of getting associated with United States university tennis. How does playing college tennis in the US help a player?Playing college tennis in the US can be beneficial in so many ways. With an individual sport like tennis, it is one of the very few times in a person’s playing career that they can be part of a team; other than playing in the Olympics or Fed Cup/Davis Cup, that is generally about it. College tennis has become extremely popular internationally over the last 20-30 years. What are the main challenges for Indian tennis players enrolling in US colleges?Being on a collegiate team, especially being in the top programmes such as Texas A&M, can be very demanding both on your mind and your body. We compete at a very high level where winning and losing is a very fine line. Often, positions on the team with regards to the line-up and who is playing and who is not playing can be of the finest margins. Therefore, it is important to already come in being a great shape. It is hard to play “catch up” especially if you come in too far behind your teammates.In general, from your experience, how many players turn professional after playing college tennis?I would say anywhere from 10-20 turn pro per year once they have completed their college career.What are benefits of spending five years playing US college tennis?Some of the benefits of playing college tennis in the US is the high level of coaching and training that is given on a day to day basis. Basically everything is paid for while the athlete is working on a very valuable college degree. In college, pretty much everything is set up for the student-athlete to just go out and play and get better without having to worry at all about setting up practices or competitions. Travel is all planned out for the student athlete. We give the student athletes all the finest fitness and training they need to succeed at the highest of levels.January to May is peak season for US college tennis? What have you suggested for players during the lockdown?The main things we are telling our players now is just try hard to stay in shape by working on their fitness and of course to rest their bodies and stay healthy. Even if not everybody can practice for now, they can still control the things that they can control, such as fitness and nutrition as well.Know the coachName: Mark WeaverAge: 47Team: Texas A&MCoaching experience: 8 years at Briarcrest Country Club as director of tennis in College Station, Texas, while serving as the volunteer coach for Texas A&M from 199-2007. 8 years as assistant coach/associate head coach for Texas A&M 2007-2015.

31-05-2020||Pune||Pune tennis players eye US universities for better training, facilities||For players who want to excel in professional tennis, one eye is set on becoming a top junior player and another one on US college tennis teams.Following the footsteps of Arjun Kadhe, Rutuja Bhosale – many players are now opting to spend five years of their career at US universities as it gives them a chance for overall development with academics and sports.“If you have a good game then there is no issue in opting for U.S college tennis. The best part is you get a scholarship, education is free and you have a lot better facilities to train. Generally, in India players evolve after the age of 23 so spending 18-23 in the U.S is always a good decision,” explains Hemant Bendrey, coach of Ankita Raina, Rutuja Bhosale and Arjun Kadhe.“One can easily get back into professional tennis circuit after they are back from the U.S and in those four years you get a lot of exposure,” added Bendrey.Kadhe was part of the Oklahoma state university team in 2014-17 while Bhosale joined Texas A&M from 2013-2017.“It was one of my career-best decisions, as it developed me as a person and a player. I became a much better player and not only on the court but also off the court it has taught me many things about life,” said Kadhe who was national collegiate athletic association (NCAA) no 1 ranked player for four seasons.“When you play college tennis, it is that you play for your team than yourself which I learned while playing for my team. It gives you an intensity which helps you a lot in the professional circuit,” added Kadhe who graduated with a business management major and marketing minor.For Bhosale, initial days were tough with the team and with academics as understanding the accent of the professor was not easy.“My coaches and my academic advisors helped me a lot and they were very helpful. Visiting Texas A&M helped me a lot because before that, I was very shy and had no idea of what to do with my career and my life but as time progressed I became confident,” said Bhosale.“I don’t know if I hadn’t chosen to go for college tennis, where I would have been right now professionally and I don’t regret those four years,” added Bhosale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/city-tennis-players-eye-us-universities-for-better-training-facilities/story-SDJafnnXzaEacoPauDH4lJ.html
