A video to this effect was being circulated on social media, which forced API Jitendra Thakur to transfer Sawant.The video clip shows Sawant forcing the women fishmongers, who were drenched to their bones after they came ashore with freshly caught clams and shellfish near the shallow waters of the coast, to do sit-ups, causing the women embarrassment. Some men were also in the group who had gone to catch clams and small fish.As soon as they were walking to their homes in their wet clothes, Sawant stopped them and told them they had violated lockdown and did not maintain social distancing, so as a punishment, he forced the women and men to do sit-ups while Sawant recorded the entire incident. As fishing activities are stopped, fishmongers, especially women, enter the shallow waters to catch small fish like clams and shellfish for home consumption. This action by the police officer resulted in his transfer to the Palghar control room, said API Thakur. “We are investigating who circulated the video on social media, and we will book the accused,” Thakur added. The entire incident is now being investigated by Vilas Naik, deputy superintendent of police, Palghar as it showed the police in a poor light.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cop-forces-women-to-do-sit-ups-transferred/story-7G5WecmQ2AFgenfIJUIwoI.html
15-05-2020||Mumbai||Containment zones in Mumbai down to 692 from 2,800+||After the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) change in approach, the number of containment zones in the city has reduced to 692, from the earlier more than 2,800.Among the first few changes in standard operating procedure made by municipal commissioner IS Chahal, when he took charge on Friday last week, was creation of watertight containment pockets. Earlier, if a Covid-19 positive case was found in a building, BMC tagged the building as a containment zone and sealed it. As part of its new approach, the civic body has now removed standalone buildings and chawls from the list of containment zones, dividing the 2,800+ zones into two – containment zones and sealed buildings. There are now 1,271 sealed buildings in Mumbai within the 692 containment zones.Chahal had said on Wednesday, “I am now rationalising the number of containment zones. A population of 5,000 to 6,000 is ideal for one containment zone. However, in Mumbai, every building is one containment zone. Of the 2,800 containment zones in the city, 1,153 are standalone buildings, with a single Covid-19 case.”Chahal said he realised manning so many “so-called containment zones” was a waste of police manpower. “The number 2,800 rises rapidly everyday and scares people. They think yet another big area has been engulfed by Covid-19.”BMC has now used natural boundaries such as roads, nullahs, chowks to seal the zones. Zones can be made of a few buildings with cases, a square or an area that is easy to lock in. While these zones will be manned by the police, the sealed buildings will have to carry out “self-management.”The cooperative managing bodies of these buildings will have to ensure nobody enters or exits the building and BMC will be responsible for sanitising the building, taking co-morbid people from the building to quarantine centres for observation, if necessary. For the larger containment zone, BMC and Covid warriors appointed from among elected representatives such as corporators and MLAs will be responsible for operating the zone, such as distributing food packets and handling fever clinics.After analysing the containment zones, sealed buildings and the cases, it was seen that the number of cases in a ward is no longer directly proportional to the number of containment zones. Explaining the implication, a senior civic officer said, “If one building has a newly discovered Covid-19 case, but is already in or adjoining an existing containment zone, it will be added to this zone, and will be sealed. We are no longer creating a new containment zone for every building. A ward may have an overall high number of cases, but can have few containment zones if the cases are concentrated in one area that can be locked in.”For example, going by the data for cases as of May 12 and containment zones as of May 14, the E ward (Byculla) with 1,347 Covid-19 cases has 19 containment zones and 112 sealed buildings, as opposed to the C ward (Marine Lines) with 134 Covid-19 cases, which has 27 containment zones and 18 sealed buildings. Five wards in the city have cases shooting above 1,000. The F-North ward (Wadala and Sewri) with 1,205 cases has 22 containment zones and 90 sealed buildings. The G-North ward, which houses Dharavi, has 1,382 cases and 11 containment zones, with 7 sealed buildings. The G-South ward (Worli and Prabhadevi) with 1,171 cases has 14 containment zones and 41 sealed buildings. The K-West ward (Andheri) with 1,073 cases has 13 containment zones and 91 sealed buildings. However, the P-North ward (Malad) with only 287 cases has 28 containment zones and 41 sealed buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/containment-zones-in-mumbai-down-to-692-from-2-800/story-JNRjEZFzWaop4AdsiWl8zL.html

15-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai university administration meets college heads to plan final year exams||In a relief to students, the University of Mumbai on Friday indicated that it will soon release the schedule for semester examinations for final year students. The university administration held meetings with all heads of departments and principals of affiliated colleges to discuss the way forward for examination and the new academic session. Last week, the state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant had announced that all final year students will have to appear for their final semester exams between July 1 and 30. He had also announced that all other students will be promoted to the next semester. Following Samant’s announcement, some final year students had started an online petition asking the government to scrap exams. Meanwhile, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has issued recommendations and guidelines for promoting students to the next academic year.In line with Samant’s directions and following the UGC directive, the university administration, headed by vice-chancellor Suhas Pednekar, consulted with 857 principals, deans and heads of departments over a series of meetings on the matter. The discussions pertained to the examinations to be conducted by colleges, evaluation of papers, ATKT (allowed to keep term), internal marking and grading pattern to be adopted under the circumstances.While usually semester exams of the University of Mumbai are held in April and May, this year most exams had to be scrapped owing t the lockdown. After confusion over exam dates, Samant clarified last week that all students, except those in final year, will be promoted to the next year. He directed universities and colleges to adopt UGC recommendation and promote students based on a 50-50% gradation formula--50% will be based a student’s performance in internals and other projects in the current semester and 50% will be based on the student’s performance in the previous semester. Those with ATKT would be passed temporarily but would have to appear for an exam within 120 days of the start of the new semester.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-university-administration-meets-college-heads-to-plan-final-year-exams/story-dBYgGfIOSQcSj4xaYztWhJ.html

The hoteliers alleged that their establishments have been excluded from the list of hotels being circulated to the passengers so that a few favoured can grab the business.“We have received complaints from our members that the passengers were given a list of hardly 12 hotels to choose from. This is an injustice to others and is hurting their business,” said Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, president, HRAWI.He added that HRAWI had submitted a list of 40 member hotels to the authorities who wanted to aid them in this work.BJP leader Krishna Hegde, who is fighting for the hoteliers, said such moves will only wreck the bleeding hotel business. “The hotels were already running in losses and on top of that, the civic body told them to start this facility. They spent lakhs and equipped their staff to deal with this situation. However, they are now not getting any business,” rued Hegde.Guardian minister Aslam Shaikh said the state government will take action against this. “I have received no complaint till date but if anyone approaches, will ask officials to investigate and take action,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/readied-hotels-but-not-included-in-vande-bharat-list/story-Z1LGXZEuBIXLYZUSPJu0vK.html
15-05-2020||Mumbai||MPCB warns Badlapur effluent treatment plant after Waldhuni river turns red||The state pollution control board has pulled up wastewater management after the members of the Ulhasnagar Citizens Forum filed a complaint with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) attaching photographs of Waldhuni river which had turned red due to industrial effluents. Waldhuni, a tributary of the Ulhas river, supplies water to cities in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.On Thursday evening, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) issued a notice to the Badlapur common effluent treatment plant (CETP) directing them to respond within 48 hours about the source of the pollution, and that the CETP had failed in curtailing effluents. “If the CETP fails to respond to the direction notice by Sunday, we will initiate legal action and also consider shutting down the plant, which means industries functioning in the area will not be working as well,” said SL Waghmare, regional officer (Kalyan), MPCB.A three-member team from MPCB surveyed a nine-kilometre stretch of the river from Ulhasnagar railway station to Badlapur, to check the source of the effluents. “We found that the effluents were being released into the CETP where effective treatment was not taking place. However, the source of the red colour is still unclear,” said Waghmare.The CETP is run by an association of local industrial units. According to CETP operators, 22 pharmaceutical, textile, food processing and chemical industries were functional during the lockdown, sending effluents to the CETP. Normally, 163 industries (130 chemical and 33 textile) are functioning. “The source of the effluent is coming mostly from red dye from one of the textile industries. Our vigilance team of three members have been directed to investigate and inform MPCB at the earliest,” said Khushal S Jain, member, Badlapur CETP. “We will ensure the matter is resolved. If industries are shut it will lead to further job losses in this difficult period.”According to MPCB’s daily CETP report published on its website, surprisingly all water quality parameters were within safe limits. “The red colour is still there, but within the next couple of days, water quality will further improve,” said Waghmare.Complainant and member of the citizens’ forum Sanjay Burman denied MPCB’s claim. “The colour has further intensified into almost a maroon shade on the surface of the river, and the foul smell has increased. All state authorities are in hand in glove with the chemical mafia for a long time. The lockdown has finally exposed this,” he said.“The fact that CETPs have not been performing to the required standards is not hidden from MPCB for many years. Time and again MPCB has offered cover to CETPs instead of taking punitive action,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti, a petitioner in the matter before the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mpcb-warns-badlapur-effluent-treatment-plant-after-waldhuni-river-turns-red/story-2LuyAB8VR5416b5fu8uSNJ.html

He said that farmers were running out of patience due to the delay.Addressing mediapersons, the MP said the government has made the payment process so complicated that both the farmers and the commission agents are suffering.“Two days ago, the agriculture minister said that the farmers had only received payment for wheat procured till April 25 and not a single penny was paid to them for purchases made thereafter,” Hooda said.“The government has so far paid only Rs 1,500 crore out of the 12,500 crore due. About 65 lakh metric tonnes of wheat has been procured in the state so far, while the estimated arrival is close to 120 lakh metric tonnes.

15-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab in a fix over new discharge guidelines for asymptomatic cases||The Punjab health department is in a fix over the new discharge guidelines of Union ministry of health and family welfare for treatment of asymptomatic patients of Covid-19.The new guidelines say any patient can be sent to ‘home isolation’ if he is asymptomatic when he is tested positive.However, the state health department has strong reservations on the issue, keeping in mind the history of large number of suspects jumping the home quarantine.“We are discussing the issue at the higher level and with our experts as people often jump home quarantine and pose danger to others. Guidelines are being framed on the discharge of the asymptomatic patients,” Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, nodal officer for Covid-19, said.Notably, more than 75% of Covid-19 cases in Punjab are asymptomatic. In case of 1,225 Nanded-returnees found positive for the virus, only around 35 were showing symptoms.As per the Union health ministry guidelines, a patient has to follow 17-day home isolation from the date of testing and if he or she does not develop fever for 10 days, there is no need for testing after the home isolation is over.Notably, Punjab on Thursday also modified Union health ministry’s new discharge protocol for symptomatic patients.“The ministry says if any symptomatic patient with no fever or other symptoms for three consecutive days can be sent to home isolation. However, Punjab has amended this protocol. When symptomatic patients will stop showing symptoms during treatment, we will observe them for five days and will discharge only if he continues to remain asymptomatic,” a senior health functionary.STATE WITNESSES SHARP DIP IN DAILY ADDITION OF CASESDr Bhaskar said only three patients tested positive for the virus on Friday and the state has added just 18 cases in past four days.“What is more satisfactory for us is that the dip was witnessed when our testing has increased in the past ten days. The surge in the cases earlier was due to testing of Punjabi’s stuck in other parts of the country, including Kota and Nanded,” he added.Since May 10, Punjab has conducted more than 9,000 tests and has recorded 112 new positive cases, most of whom are Nanded-returnees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-in-a-fix-over-new-discharge-guidelines-for-asymptomatic-cases/story-00JF6I4SPwAs81XVsO3apJ.html

15-05-2020||City||AYUSH dept distributes immunity booster tablets in containment zones||Gurugram: Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Gurugram, the district ayurvedic officer has started distributing immunity booster tablets to the senior citizens residing in the containment zones.In the past 15 days, the Haryana AYUSH Department has sent out 23,000 packets of Guduchi Ghanvati for senior citizens and frontline workers in nine out of 34 containment zones in Gurugram, officials said. The department dispenses ayurvedic medicines through all the district ayurvedic officers in the state. “We have been distributing the medicines for the past two weeks,” said Manju Bangar, district AYUSH officer. The medicines are handed over to the MCG councillor of the respective area for further distribution.In Dundahera, which has reported 21 Covid-19 positive cases till now, around 2,000 packets of Guduchi Ghanvati were given to the MCG councillor on Thursday. Virender Yadav, MCG councillor, Dundahera, said he has distributed the medicines to some senior citizens. “Some AYUSH workers had come to my locality on Thursday and they gave me around 2,000 packets of ayurvedic medicines,” Yadav said. A week ago, such medicine packets of similar quantity were given to the MCG councillor of Jharsa where 37 Covid-19 cases have come till now. Hemant Kumar, councillor, Jharsa, said, “The AYUSH team had given the medicines to me. I have distributed 40 packets till now and rest of the medicines will be given out soon.”Along with the medicines, the AYUSH team has given a feedback form to the area councillors or society presidents which they have to give to the senior citizens so that the AYUSH department can know if people are actually consuming these immunity booster medicines. Bangar said, “We have told the councillors/society presidents to ask senior citizens to fill in a feedback form so that we can also know if they are using the medicines or not. In the present scenario, we will have to wait for the form to reach us.”On Friday, Gurugram reported nine new Covid-19 cases, taking the total tally of positive cases to 179 in the district.Dr Geetanjali Arora, Panchakarma specialist, AYUSH Gurugram, said that it is not possible to give the medicines to every household in a containment zone. “Area councillors and society presidents have been given the task of distributing the medicines to the senior citizens.”Initially, the AYUSH department was providing Guduchi Ghanvati and Anu Tel (oil), but now it is only distributing Guduchi Ghanvati. “We were earlier giving Guduchi Ghanvati and Anu Tel. But now we are not distributing Anu Tel due to supply shortage,” said Bangar.Guduchi Ghanvati is believed to help keep cells healthy and get rid of diseases. The application of Anu tel (oil) helps in reducing any respiratory inflammation, AYUSH officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ayush-dept-distributes-immunity-booster-tablets-in-containment-zones/story-78KRAbbsMogZaoXORALWRP.html

The 20-year-old was allegedly subjected to racial discrimination and brutally attacked by locals from Faizapur, Gurugram in Haryana just for passing through the locality on Sunday afternoon.Reportedly, she was saved by people and police were called. The NHRC noted, “The police instead of initiating the requisite legal process, asked the victim to compromise. Accordingly, a notice has been issued to the chief secretary and the commissioner of police, Gurugram, calling for a detailed report within four weeks along with status of the investigation and counselling provided by the authorities to the victim.”The Commission would also like to know about present health condition of the victim and the status of the medical treatment being provided to her by the district authorities, it added.The Commission further observed that it is “disgusting” that a woman from North-Eastern part of her own country has been subjected to racial discrimination and physical assault by a local family in the NCR region.Reportedly, the victim was stopped by an elderly woman, who rudely interrupted her from passing through the road stating that it was a private property.The woman reportedly abused her in a racial tone and as the altercation started, the victim was called “corona”.In the meantime, the other family members also came out and started beating the victim with sticks. The woman, who was also hit on her head, was somehow saved by some local people and the police was called.NHRC said the victim is reportedly undergoing medical treatment and her CT scan results are awaited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/human-rights-body-takes-cognizance-of-racial-attack-on-manipur-woman/story-5LSBoJ9i56KWRtBd4fVtLK.html
15-05-2020||Mumbai||Monsoon onset in city to be delayed beyond June 11: IMD||The onset of the southwest monsoon over the city is likely to be delayed beyond June 11, the weather bureau said on Friday. Independent meteorologists said that the monsoon’s arrival over Mumbai was unlikely before June 15.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday issued its forecast for the onset of the southwest monsoon over Kerala on June 5 with a model error of ± 4 days while the advancement over the Andaman Sea, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and some parts of southeast Bay of Bengal is expected over the next 48 hours.“Since there is a delay over Kerala, we can infer that there will be delay over nearby areas extending up to Maharashtra. We can further infer that it will be slightly delayed for Mumbai from its new onset date of June 11,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD.Many factors were considered to determine the date of onset for Kerala, said Mohapatra, including a low pressure weather system that is likely to intensify into cyclone Amphan over southeast Bay of Bengal. “Once it becomes a severe cyclonic storm moving north-northeast, it will influence the surrounding environment by pulling moisture, affecting the progression of the southwest monsoon. As the cyclonic system dies down, further monsoon progression is expected,” he said.Last year, Mumbai witnessed its most delayed monsoon onset in 45 years after the southwest monsoon was declared over the city on June 25, 2019. In 2018, it had arrived on June 9 and in 2017, on June 12.HT had reported on April 16 that the duration of the southwest monsoon over Mumbai has been extended by eight days after the weather bureau announced revised monsoon onset and withdrawal dates. The new onset date for Mumbai is June 11 (against June 10 originally) and the new withdrawal date has been declared as October 8 against the existing September 29.Akshay Deoaras, independent meteorologist and Ph.D. researcher at the University of Reading said the coming cyclone was not the only reason for the delay. “Another important reason for the delay was the lack of support of phenomena such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation [a rain-bearing weather system]. “The presence of such factors can speed up the monsoon’s progression along the west coast,” said Deoras. “Current forecasts don’t indicate a robust progression of the monsoon towards Maharashtra after its onset over Kerala. We can anticipate its arrival in Maharashtra in the third week of June, resulting in a delay of a week in southern parts of Konkan while arrival in Mumbai, most of Vidarbha, Marathwada and central Maharashtra is unlikely before June 15.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/monsoon-onset-in-city-to-be-delayed-beyond-june-11-imd/story-uVb1UbchxitUDkQBIn3VjM.html

The survey was done by the organisers of the fund.The fund has been established to provide the immediate distribution of finance to young leaders on the frontlines of the response to Covid–19, with donations distributed across countries and sectors.Jayathma Wickramanayake, a United Nations special envoy for youth, added: “The Covid-19 Young Leaders Fund is exactly the bold action that is required to champion young people who are so bravely combating the coronavirus disease on the frontlines”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-doctor-wins-global-funding-to-deal-with-covid-19/story-1LfRzaCxuIMzaJbG0x4j4L.html
15-05-2020||Delhi||Most DU students lack resources, material to give online exams||Twenty-year-old Sachin Pathak, a student of Delhi University, is worried about his final-year exams in July. Reason? His phone’s keypad is not working. And the phone is to be shared with his sibling—another final-year student of DU. They are residents of Delhi’s Burari area where father works as a daily wage labourer.“I don’t even have a touch-screen phone. How is it possible for me to finish my paper within two hours with such slow Internet and then look for a place where I can scan it and upload it within an hour? The cyber cafes, if open, will have a queue,” Pathak, who wants to apply for jobs after getting his degree, said.“I have plans to study via correspondence and apply for jobs to support my family. If the exams are conducted online, I will not be able to score well,” he added.Hundreds of DU students like Pathak posted their concerns on social media on Friday using the hashtag #DUAgainstOnlineExams which had over 48,000 tweets till Friday evening. The “Twitter storm” comes a day after DU announced that it may conduct an open-book online examination for final-year students if the Covid-19 situation prevented it from holding a regular pen-and-paper examination. Using memes and video messages, students highlighted their concerns about the online open-book examination, including poor Internet connectivity, lack of access to devices, inability to download reading material, risk of impersonation, and lack of familiarity with the open-book examination mode.While the notification released on Thursday refers to final-year students, first- and second-year students are also anxious about their mode of examination. Harsh Suri, a resident of Kashmir and a first-year student in Hindu College, said, “We’re stressed because there is no clarity yet. Students from Jammu and Kashmir are neither able to attend their online classes nor download 100 MB reading material on the 2G network. Even laptops don’t work on 2G network and we are unable to research for our assignments. How are we supposed to give our exams? Even to tweet against the online exam took me 20 minutes.”Amal K Simon, another final-year student and a resident of Kerala, said, “We don’t have reading material at home and everything is in Delhi. Besides, we have never appeared for any kind of open-book test before and are not trained for it. So many of my friends from remote areas run the risk of having their job offers rescinded because they will be unable to appear for these exams.”The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad on Friday submitted a memorandum to DU vice-chancellor asking for wider consultation with all stakeholders and recommending measures like multiple modes of examination and the promotion of intermediate students based on their earlier marks. The Vice-Chancellor was unavailable for comment.Meanwhile, the varsity’s Covid-19 task force constituted to look into academic matters during the pandemic, on Friday, wrote to all principals asking them to compile e-resources to help students. “There are many students who don’t have their books. So we have asked principals to identify and share e-resources which can be compiled by us and sent to students who can use them,” Payal Mago, a member of the task force, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/most-du-students-lack-resources-material-to-give-online-exams/story-VvVPFzCIpDbtOsK9W7zXkN.html
15-05-2020||Delhi||South district admin says JNU should allow stranded students back on campus||The South Delhi district administration on Friday wrote to the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), raising issues faced by its students stranded in the NCR due to the Covid-19 lockdown. The district administration has suggested the university allow these students back into the campus taking all precautions.In a letter addressed to JNU vice-chancellor Jagadesh Kumar and registrar Pramod Kumar, sub-divisional magistrate (Mehrauli) office wrote, “It’s to inform that several emails have been received in this office from the students of JNU regarding denied of entry into the campus due to fear of COVID-19 infection. Students have also informed that they are facing difficulties as their money have exhausted and requested their entry into the campus to stay in their respective allotted hostels [sic].”“Keeping in view the severity of the situation, JNU may approach the district surveillance officer for medical screening of the students who are willing to enter the campus to avoid hardships to them at this critical juncture [sic],” the letter added.The university had, on March 19, asked the students to vacate their hostels citing the lockdown announced by the Delhi government. Following this, several students had left for their homes or their friends’ or relative’s places. The remaining students were allowed to stay back in hostels after the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24 and public transport facilities were suspended. The university, however, had prohibited the entry and exit of students from the campus citing safety measures.JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Aishe Ghosh said that the union has written to the administration requesting them to allow the students stranded in the NCR back to their hostels. “The students can be screened and can be asked to quarantine themselves for the appropriate amount of time. The campus has adequate space that can be utilised as a quarantine facility. We have written to the district magistrate office as well,” she said.South Delhi district magistrate BM Mishra said that considering the hardships of stranded students, his office has suggested the JNU administration allow them entry to the campus.A final-year PhD scholar, who did not wish to be quoted, said that she had to leave the campus on March 21.”I had come to Munirka to live with a friend, thinking that I’d be back to the campus within a few days. When the lockdown was extended, her parents took her back to their home in Noida. Now I’ve been living here alone and the landlord is asking me for the rent. I can’t afford the rent. I’m totally out of money,” she said.Both the JNU vice-chancellor and registrar did not respond to calls and texts for comment. A senior official, who wished not to be named, said, “The university will discuss this and will soon make a decision keeping in mind the safety and security of the JNU community.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/south-district-admin-says-jnu-should-allow-stranded-students-back-on-campus/story-L0suExH8DXd66wnlqHGK5L.html

15-05-2020||City||Gzb chalks out plan to deal with rising cases in Khoda||Ghaziabad: The district health department has chalked out a plan to deal with the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Khoda, a densely populated locality that has seen 26 positive cases so far, officials said on Friday. The health department has deputed 100 teams, each comprising three health workers, for conducting the door-to-door survey in the area, which was sealed on May 10. “Besides, we have also deployed five expert teams in different sectors of Khoda who are taking up random sampling. Each team comprises a doctor, a pharmacist and a lab technician. Further, our teams are also distributing medicines to the residents in Khoda and we have planned that at least two face masks will be given to each household through CSR funds,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO).The Ghaziabad district on Thursday had seen 19 new Covid-19 cases, of which eight were from Khoda, the officials said, adding that one positive case was found from the locality on Wednesday during the random sampling.“Majority of cases in Khoda have links to people who had attended religious congregations. The Khoda locality is already sealed by the administration and we expect that we will be able to contain the number of cases as people are staying indoors,” Gupta said.Located between Ghaziabad, Noida and Delhi, Khoda has an estimated population of about 2.85 lakh living in about 42,000 households. The district administration on May 10 had sealed 50 out of 52 entry points in Khoda and restricted the entry of residents. The officials further said that some cases have also come in from Vaishali, Jhandapur and Loni, and health teams are actively trying to control the spread of deadly virus in these areas too. On Friday, three new Covid-19 cases were reported in Ghaziabad, taking the total count of positive cases in the district to 172, the officials said. They added that one case each was reported from Shalimar Garden and Vaishali Sector-1, while a two years old baby girl from Dasna has also tested positive for the deadly virus.“The child’s mother is a Covid-19 patient,” the CMO added.Of the 172 positive cases, 106 patients have been discharged from different hospitals so far while two have died. A total of 568 reports are still pending, the officials said.Gupta said that to clear off the pending tests, the state officials have asked for taking up sampling of only high-risk cases or those showing symptoms.“The message has been received from state officials that sampling for the next three days will be done only for high-risk cases and also for those who show any symptoms. The high-risk category includes people who are primary contacts of Covid-19 positive cases or those who are affected by severe acute respiratory infection,” the CMO added.On Thursday, the district magistrate’s office did not release the daily statement of Covid-19 cases, but the statement by the state surveillance officer revealed 19 new cases in Ghaziabad. Besides, five more positive cases from Wednesday were added to the Thursday’s new cases by the health department officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gzb-chalks-out-plan-to-deal-with-rising-cases-in-khoda/story-PmkD8yOz5JkTPf7K7pm0pO.html
15-05-2020||City||1,420 leave for home in Bihar in first Sharmik special train from Ghaziabad||The first Sharmik special train, ferrying migrant workers to Bihar, departed from Ghaziabad junction Friday evening. As many as 1,420 persons who were stranded in the city after the nationwide lockdown was imposed boarded the train and will reach their home towns such as Muzaffarpur, Chappra and Hajipur in Bihar on Saturday.The officials of the Ghaziabad district administration said more trains will be roped in to take workers to their home towns.On Friday afternoon, hundreds of passengers who had received text messages about confirmed seats on the train had reached the Ghanta Ghar Ramlila Ground where arrangements for checking their IDs and screening them for symptoms of coronavirus disease(Covid-19) had been put in place. They were later taken in Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) to Ghaziabad railway station, about 1km away.“I had applied on the UP government portal— jansunwai.up.nic.in— a week ago to go back home, and received a text message on my mobile on Thursday. The message said that I should reach Ramlila Ground around 2pm. Since the company in Noida’s Sector 62 where I used to work is shut, I have no option but to return to my hometown Muzaffarpur,” said Manish Kumar, one of the first passengers to board the train.Officials said the passengers did not have to pay for the tickets which were issued to them after they were screened at Ramlila Ground.Laxman Mahto was stuck in Loni since the lockdown came into force on March 25 boarded the 20-coach train with five other family members. He had come from Muzaffarpur to visit his daughter on March 15.“I had booked a ticket to return home in March, but the train was cancelled due to the lockdown. For the past two months, I had been staying in Loni. A neighbour got us registered on the UP government portal and we booked six seats to return to Bihar. These seats were confirmed through an SMS on Friday and we arrived at the Ramlila Ground,” said Mahto.However, many people who want to go to their homes in Bihar were not able to get a confirmed seat on the train, and will have to wait longer. “On Thursday, I had got a call on my mobile asking me if I wish to go to my home town in Bihar but had not received any SMS. When I arrived at Ramlila Ground, officials told me that I will have to wait as I had not received a confirmatory SMS which is must for boarding the train. I even vacated my rented room in Karhera, and came here in the hope to board the train,” Mahesh Saini, who is an ice-cream vendor and is from Chappra in Bihar, added.Ramzan Ali, who is from Saran district in Bihar, and had come from Khoda said only two of his eight family members received confirmatory messages and the rest will have to wait.Siddhanth Mishra, a cloth trader in Khoda village, had registered 11 of his family members and was lucky enough to leave for home with all of them. “ We will be travelling to our home town Nalanda, which is about 150km from Muzaffarpur, where the train will drop us. We received the SMS two days ago and were ready with our luggage. I know how to use the internet and mobile applications, so we registered on the portal and are now heading home. But I also feel bad for other migrant workers who don’t know how to use smartphones and internet, and are headed home on foot with their children and belongings,” Mishra said.There were many people from other states who had reached Ramlila Grounds hoping they will be able to go home as well.“After I reached here, I was told that train will ferry passengers going to Bihar. I had vacated my rented room in Delhi, and arrived here to go to my home town in Mau district in UP. It seems we will now have to look for a shelter home here. We will wait in Ghaziabad, and see if we can get a train or a UPSRTC bus that might be plying from Morta” said Kripa Shankar Pandey, who had come with his wife and children from Gandhinagar in Delhi.Many who are fortunate enough to be able to head home hope they will find a stable source of income in search of which they had come to cities like Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad.“I hope that I get a job in my home town in Vaishali district in Bihar. I think I will not return to the city, and just want to reach my home somehow. My landlord in Khoda has been very helpful. Since I got seats for my family, I vacated my rented room and somehow arrived here from Khoda. The SMS I received allowed my family to move out of Khoda which has been sealed because of the coronavirus outbreak,” said Santosh Kumar who worked as a driver in Delhi. After the lockdown, Kumar was left out of work and decided to head home.Officials said until Thursday, as many as 37,438 persons had registered themselves with the UP government portal for travelling from Ghaziabad to Bihar.“Those who did not receive a confirmatory SMS will have to wait for some more time. We cleared the boarding passes of about 1,420 persons for the first train to Bihar. In the next few days, we expect that more trains will head towards this and other routes. We will also soon receive the list of people who have registered on the portal want to go to other states,” said Sanjay Kumar, officer on special duty, Ghaziabad Development Authority(GDA), who is also in-charge of travel arrangements of migrant workers in the district.“The migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh who have not registered on the portal are also being taken in UPSRTC buses from Morta,” he added.Additional district magistrate Santosh Kumar Vaishya said there was around a two-hour delay in departure of the train as there were a lot of people at the station who had to be screened and allotted seats. The scheduled departure time of the train was 7pm, but it left the station at 9.10pm. “We have issued nearly 1420 boarding passes. The train will directly stop at three stations of Muzaffarpur, Chappra and Hajipur in Bihar. All passengers were screened and food packets were also provided to them,” he added.According to district officials so far, nearly 17,007 migrant workers, including 10,219 from UP, have been sent to their home towns with the help of 461 buses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-420-leave-for-home-in-bihar-in-first-sharmik-special-train-from-ghaziabad/story-hBfMkEYkq0Ug9PyPCBcMnO.html

And hundreds of people working at the airports have devoted themselves to smoothen the process of import, transport and distribution of such products. At Delhi airport, there are almost 400 people working round the clock to avoid glitches in the supply. As a part of the government’s Lifeline Udan initiative, as of May 11 with the help of 506 flights, 862.39 tons of essential cargo have been transported to different parts of the country. Convincing their families has been the biggest challenge for most. “I haven’t met my mother for 20 days, and for their safety, I prefer staying away. She has been worried for me but understands the importance. I always wanted to serve the nation and this is my chance,” says Anshul Gupta, project head (medical supplies) and cargo manager.Sanskiriti Yadav, assistant manager, cargo, says that she is staying in Delhi, away from her Lucknow-based parents, but is disheartened at the behaviour of her neighbours. “I walk four kilometers daily to reach my workplace. My neighbours look at me in disgust and ask me to stay at home for their safety, but what I’m doing is for the safety of millions,” adds Yadav. “To keep my team motivated, as some haven’t met their families for weeks, we have meetings and sessions every morning. I tell them to perform yoga and have immunity boosters. They are informed on a daily basis about precautions to be taken during this time,” explains Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ground-heroes-aid-essential-cargo/story-EUZermMmtuRL29SHvJxNFK.html

The move assumes significance after the number of Covid cases in the state coincided with the arrival of migrant workers as many of them have tested positive. The state government has already given nod for the running of a large number of Shramik Special trains, originating from different states, to facilitate the return of stranded migrant workers. In addition to giving permission to press buses for ferrying them back, it has also allowed small vehicles to be pressed into service for the purpose of bringing them back from nearby states and locations.With media reports highlighting the plight of migrant workers, a sizeable number of whom started to trudge back home on foot in the absence of proper co-ordination, chief minster also issued an appeal asking them not to walk or make detours to reach the state. “Adequate steps are in place to facilitate your return. There is no need for putting yourself to such hardship,” he said.“All those who have reached railway station or the borders of the state will be sent to their native places by suitable transport. There is absolutely no need to walk. All you need to do is to inform the nearest police station of the block office and arrangements will be made for forward journey,” the chief minister said.He also directed officials to maintain proper arrangements at the designated quarantine centres and assured migrant workers that there was no cause for apprehension even as he appealed to all those put up at these centres to maintain discipline and co-operate with the administration.“Observing the mandatory quarantine period with norms prescribed for social distancing and hygiene is in the overall interest of the concerned, their families and society,” Kumar said, in an apparent hint at stray instances of attempts to create disturbance by inmates at few places.As for the expenditure incurred on rail fare for boarding special trains, Kumar asked officials to complete advance planning for the reimbursement of the amount spent, along with an additional sum of Rs 500, into the account of all those staying at quarantine centres.The state government has mandated that the amount would be directly transferred into the bank accounts of all those completing the compulsory 21-day quarantine period. “In any event, the amount will not be less than Rs 1,000 announced for each of the migrant workers stranded in the places f their work, in wake of the nationwide lockdown,” Kumar said, reiterating government’s decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/facilitate-early-return-of-migrants-to-mitigate-risk-of-infections-nitish-to-officials/story-xZvHu9VDduJSowRM0bFwxM.html
15-05-2020||Patna||Covid cases top 1,000 in Bihar, 100 in capital; migrants account for 44%||The incoming migrants contributed to a steady spurt in coronavirus, adding to 44% of Bihar’s 1,018 cases, with seven deaths so far, after 19 people tested positive for Sars-CoV-2 on Friday.Covid-19 cases in Patna touched 100 on a day when Bihar breached the 1,000-mark barrier since the first three Sars-CoV-2 cases were reported in the state on March 22.Khagaria and Siwan reported five cases each, followed by Vaishali, Jamui, Madhubani (2 each) and Nawada, Lakhisarai and Patna (1 each).Thirty-two among those infected by the virus so far in the state were policemen, of which 22 belonged to the Bihar Military Police (BMP), while 10 others were from the district police constabulary, said Jitendra Kumar, additional director general of police (headquarters) during a joint media briefing.“The district cops, who tested positive, had returned from leave. We kept them at quarantine centres and tested them before being allowed to rejoin duty, which is when they tested positive. Eight of the 10 cops had recovered,” he added.“The number of cases of coronavirus has gone up after May 3, when 391 workers tested Covid-19 positive among the total 449 migrants infected by the virus so far,” said health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh.Of the 391 migrants testing positive, 122 had come from New Delhi, 105 from Gujarat, 77 from Maharashtra, 23 from West Bengal and 21 from Haryana, besides some other states, he added.As on date, 2.72 lakh migrant workers were staying at 5,162 block quarantine camps, after 2,46,160 migrant workers had reached Bihar by 195 Shramik Special trains till May 14, said Anupam Kumar, secretary, information and public relations department.He said 36 such trains were scheduled to reach Bihar on Friday and 40 others were planned for Saturday.The chief minister had asked his officials to arrange for expeditious transportation of as many migrants from the state who wanted to return because their risk of contracting the infection was higher in event of delay in returning to the state. Kumar said a “senior officer” had tested positive for the virus when he went to a quarantine camp to address an issue, involving some people, who had tested positive and were residing there.He, however, refused to disclose the officer’s rank.Meanwhile, the health department was making concerted efforts to scale up Covid-19 testing in the state.Singh said testing using TrueNat machines would commence in the next 24-48 hours at the Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College in Gaya, the Vardhaman Institute of Medical Sciences, Pawapuri, and at Siwan.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar had on May 7 directed officials to procure these machines and install them at all district hospitals for speedy coronavirus test results. He has also directed officials to ramp up state’s Covid-19 testing capacity.The Indian Council of Medical Research had recently okayed the diagnostic machines, generally used for testing drug-resistant tuberculosis, in an effort to bolster testing capacity.At the moment, Bihar is testing around 1,900 to 2,000 samples on an average daily. Kumar wants it to be scaled up to 10,000.With 27 Covid-19 patients having been cured in the last 24 hours, the total number of recoveries in the state went up to 438.As of Friday, Munger reported 122 cases, followed by Patna (100), Rohtas (77), Nalanda (66), Buxar (59), Begusarai (47), Siwan (43), Kaimur (33), Khagaria (41), Bhagalpur (33), Madhubani (32), Bhojpur (29), Jehanabad, Nawada (26 each), West Champaran (25), Gopalganj (24), Aurangabad, Muzaffarpur (18 each), Darbhanga (16 each), East Champaran (15), Banka (14), Lakhisarai (13) Katihar, Arwal, Purnea, Sheikhpura (12 each), Samastipur, (11), Kishanganj, Saran, Saharsa (10 each), Madhepura, Supaul (9 each), Gaya, Vaishali (8 each), Sitamarhi (7), Araria (4) and Sheohar, Jamui (3 each) till the time of going to the press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/covid-cases-top-1-000-in-bihar-100-in-capital-migrants-account-for-44/story-1JSLnogipT7pFaVzfP39gK.html

How would they feed data,” said Giriraj Rastogi, office bearer of the Chemists and Druggists Federation, Uttar Pradesh, a body of medicine retailers and whole-sellers.“These drugs are not scheduled, hence customers, particularly women, will raise objection when asked for their name, contact or address,” said Vikas Rastogi of the Lucknow Chemists’ Association.There are scheduled drugs, such as those used as sleeping pills for which customers have to give details while purchasing them, but the new order is yet to be circulated among public.The medicine sellers said the other way could be to first issue a message among the public and also make alternative arrangement for collection of data so that the entire sale is noted with the FSDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/now-give-personal-details-while-buying-cold-cough-and-fever-drugs/story-ciOFAcI1wwbkmDd56PSRUI.html
15-05-2020||Delhi||As lockdown sets to ease, DUSIB readies guidelines for shelter homes||The Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) is preparing guidelines for its shelter homes to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) once lockdown norms are further relaxed from May 18.The NGOs running the government’s 223 shelter homes say that people living here are likely to step out in search of work depending on the relaxation in lockdown norms and so there is a need for guidelines for better Covid-19 management. The government had also set up 126 temporary shelters after the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 25.Bipin Rai, a member of DUSIB, said, “We are preparing a list of dos and don’ts for shelter homes for the better management of Covid-19, especially now (once the further relaxation in norms is announced).”“This would include the regular thermal screening, counselling and regular health check-up of occupants, training the shelter home staff, etc. We will issue the guidelines in a day or two,” Rai said.So far, very few cases of Covid-19 have been reported from the government-run shelter homes. But with further relaxation in norms, people living here are likely to step out in search of work. “The chances of spread of infection will increase, as people start moving in and out of the shelters. Though we have put in place measures such as the regular spraying of disinfectants, use of sanitiser, etc., there is a need to create more awareness about the disease. If the government issues some guidelines, it will help the NGOs running the shelter homes better,” Rajesh Kumar, executive director, Society for Promotion of Youth and Masses, said.According to a DUSIB official, just five or six cases of Covid-19 have been reported from government-run shelter homes. Indu Prakash, a member of the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee for homeless shelters in Delhi, said, “If there are some basic protocols in place, it will help in better management at the shelters. Regular thermal screening and regular check-ups will be useful.”While there is fear among people about Covid-19, there is growing desperation to get back to work. Vishal Kumar, who used to sell books at the Nizamuddin Railway Station before the lockdown, has been staying at a shelter at Sarai Kale Khan. “I have been out of a job for two months now. I have been helping cook at the shelter home, but now I want to get back to work. I hope the government relaxes norms so that I can look for work,” Vishal said.With people at the shelter homes waiting to get back to work as and when possible, Vinay K Stephen, chief functionary of Sadik Masih Medical Social Servant Society (SMMSSS), said it would be a challenging task to manage people the shelters when the lockdown is relaxed. “The guidelines will be helpful to manage people as we can tell them what they should do or not do at the shelter homes,” Stephen said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-lockdown-sets-to-ease-dusib-readies-guidelines-for-shelter-homes/story-tpYDgLPaADZP0b1uE7vVrI.html

15-05-2020||Lucknow||UP: Fresh guidelines bring clarity on emergency OPD||After weeks of confusion, the Uttar Pradsesh health department’s fresh guidelines have brought clarity about the running of emergency OPD service at private hospitals.“The guidelines are welcome. They have evolved from the learnings in India and abroad. Their focus is to make the health services run smoothly,” said Dr Sandeep Kapoor, director of Healthcity Hospital.HIGHLIGHTSFor admissions, all people, particularly those with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) symptoms and those coming from hotspots should be tested. Till their report comes, they should be kept in an isolation area before admission to other wards.Doctors and medical staff attending them should follow infection prevention protocol, and wear protective gear.For emergency surgery, PPE kits should be used and sampling done. If the patient tests positive, the protocol should be followed. Also, if any patient tests positive after admission, the protocol should be followed for disinfecting the ward and quarantining the high-risk staffThe guidelines say a hospital should inform the chief medical officer (CMO) if a fresh case is reported from the hospital. Thereafter, the patient should be shifted to a Covid hospital.Also, patients admitted in the same ward on beds immediately next to a Covid positive patient (on all four sides) should be considered high risk (patient) and shifted to an isolation ward, according to the fresh guidelines.Their status is to be checked after five days and before 14 days elapse, the guidelines add.“Close the ward for 24-hours, wash beds with detergent, wipe with a 70% alcohol solution later. Sanitise all equipment in the ward. If high-risk patients test negative, follow the protocol of 14-day quarantine. Also, the low-risk patients can be discharged adequately,” the guidelines say.“Hospitals now need not fear sealing or closure of the entire establishment, if the hospital and staff have learned and adequately follow the infection prevention protocol (IPP). The best part is that the guidelines are clear about what steps have to be taken in each situation,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general of the Association of International Doctors.“The guidelines ensure all remain safe from infection, not just the patient, but also the doctors and the medical staff. I welcome such guidelines,” said Dr Anoop Agrawal, secretary of the UP Orthopaedic Association.All staff, who have been within a distance of two metres from a Covid positive patient for more than 15 minutes, shall also be sent to quarantine and their RT-PCR test be done. Other staff (low-risk) shall remain in quarantine till the report of the high-risk staff comes.If all high-risk staff test negative, the low-risk ones should be called back on duty, while the high-risk staff shall still follow quarantine, according to the guidelines.“Guidelines may also be modified, depending on the situation in future,” said Dr Kapoor.

The UT administration has issued an order under SOP (standard operating procedure) wherein they asked people to pay for their accommodation. The Centre had sanctioned ₹1 crore each for Leh and Kargil districts. Where are those funds,” she asked.Aghast over money being charged by Ladakh residents, Sayeeda also wrote a letter to commissioner secretary Rigzin Samphel and took up the matter with party MP Jamyan Tsering Namgyal.The BJP councillor added that people, largely women of Chuchot Yogma village, 10 km from Leh, wanted to meet Leh district commissioner on Thursday so as to urge him to send their relatives, who were returning to Ladakh, to their homes rather than keeping them in quarantine centres, however, the commissioner did not show up.“While maintaining social distancing, these women raised slogans against Leh DC. The police lathicharged the protesters leaving four women injured,” she said.The councillor also alleged that students being ferried by buses were charged ₹500 to ₹1,000 in total contravention to government order of free transportation.Commissioner secretary Samphel did not respond to repeated calls. Leh district commissioner Sachin Kumar Vaishya said that “There was no need” (to react to her claims) and that “these are routine works”.Later, Sachin shared a clarification issued by his office on Thursday, a part of it read, “the passengers who do not wish to stay with their relatives and friends can stay in administrative quarantine facilities being run by the district administration without any charges (FCI, Dharma centre etc). However, those who do not wish to stay even in these quarantine facilities can stay in the centres identified by the administration at their own expense. However, they shall undergo mandatory 14 days home quarantine.”Sources said that the Thursday clarification was in fact issued on Friday following uproar by people and the BJP councilor.Calls to BJP MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal went unanswered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ladakh-administration-charging-money-from-returnees-in-quarantine-centres-allege-bjp-councillor/story-7Eo5LGZGfaN5xK8svyr6FI.html
15-05-2020||City||Delhi: 18-year-old killed after motorcycle hit by crane in Vivek Vihar||New Delhi: An 18-year-old student, riding his brother’s motorcycle, was killed after his vehicle was rammed by a crane allegedly being driven against the traffic on the road near east Delhi’s Vivek Vihar police station Wednesday night, the police said.The crane, a police investigator privy to the probe said, was allegedly being operated by a contractor on the behalf of the municipal corporation for picking up garbage. “The crane driver was taking it away at the end of the day when the accident took place,” said the investigator, requesting anonymity.The teenager, Akshat Gaur, had given his class 12 examinations earlier this year and had recently acquired a learner’s licence, said this uncle, Manoj Gaur.He said Akshat lived with his mother and older brother in Krishna Nagar. His father works in the finance department of a prominent hotel in Myanmar.The investigator cited above said the mishap took place around 9.40pm on Wednesday when Akshat left his home to get his older brother’s Duke motorcycle refuelled.“The accident took place just a few metres from the police station’s main gate. When we got to know of the accident, we rushed to the spot only to find the teenager lying unconscious on the road while the mangled remains of this red and black motorcycle lay near him,” said the investigator. Nearby, the crane driver, 33-year-old Ram Pukar Shah, was surrounded by the public. “His crane stood against the traffic, making it clear that he was driving on the wrong side of the road,” said the officer cited above. Akshat was rushed to GTB Hospital in a police vehicle, but he was declared brought dead. His learner’s license in his wallet helped the police ascertain his identity.“My nephew was excited when he got his learner’s licence. Recently, he had told me that his driver’s licence was due, but that he wouldn’t be able to get it due to the lockdown,” said his uncle.Manoj alleged that not only was the stretch of road, where the accident took place, poorly lit, even the crane driver hadn’t switched on his headlights.While the investigator mentioned earlier confirmed that streetlights at the spot were indeed dysfunctional, he said it was a matter of probe whether the driver was using the crane’s headlights as claimed by Manoj, as there were no eyewitnesses to the accident.“We are checking CCTV footage from the area to verify the allegations of the crane not using its headlights. While we know that the crane was moving against the traffic, footage will further help establish that,” said the investigator.None of the two people involved in the accident were inebriated, the investigator added. After the fatal hit, the driver made no attempts to escape. “He told us that he didn’t see any point in escaping with such a large vehicle,” the investigator said. Shah has been arrested after being booked under relevant IPC sections for death due to negligence.In 2018, there were at least 460 accidents in the national Capital due to driving on the wrong side of the road. A total of 69 people were killed and 483 were injured in such accidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-18-year-old-killed-after-motorcycle-hit-by-crane-in-vivek-vihar/story-Nz1j2QBkRGsq8VEa79Xw3M.html
15-05-2020||Delhi||Govt aims at planting 40 lakh saplings, highest so far||The Delhi government has set a target to plant around 40 lakh saplings across the national Capital in 2020-21—the highest ever so far. The plantation drive is to begin July first week, officials said.According to officials in the forest department, the nodal agency for plantation in the city, preparations are on in full swing for the monsoon, which is the ideal time for planting saplings, despite a few hurdles in transportation because of the ongoing nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19. The projected plantation for this fiscal is almost double that of last year’s (23 lakh saplings). This, despite the fact that last year, the target was lower than the previous year’s 32 lakh, which has been the highest until now. This was mainly because greening agencies had raised concerns over the lack of plantation area. Plantation areas primarily comprise vegetation-deficient areas, such as wastelands and clear barren patches, that are not available in the city as such. The massive plantation targets were part of the Delhi government’s strategy to mitigate air pollution in the Capital by increasing green cover. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had kick-started the drive in 2018. “We have already completed last year’s target in December and are moving on to this year’s, which is a huge target to meet. The plantation will be carried out in the south (Asola), west (Alipur) and north divisions, where large patches of land are available. The overall target is distributed among at least 20 greening agencies,” a senior department official, who did not wish to be named, said. He added that this year the target is higher, mainly because of the afforestation drive to be taken up at the Yamuna floodplains, as per directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the custodian of the floodplains, has been assigned the target of planting 10 lakh saplings followed by five lakh each by the forest department and the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC). The forest department will distribute five lakh saplings for free to citizens to plant, another official said. The other agencies involved in plantation include the New Delhi Municipal Council, the North and East municipal corporations and the Public Works Department (PWD), among others.More than 90% of the saplings to be planted will be native species such as peepal, bargad, gular, jamun, gulmohar, sheesham, arjun and pilkhan, among others. However, a senior DDA official said that so far they target planting around four lakh saplings, as per the space available, of which around 1.80 lakh will be planted on the Yamuna floodplains. “As per the space available for plantation on the floodplains and in the various parks, we are preparing to plant four lakh saplings. On the floodplains, around 1.23 lakh shrubs and about 57,000 tree saplings will be planted. We have prepared estimates and floated tenders. There is a slight delay in the process because most of the services are shut due to the lockdown,” the official said, not wishing to be named. He added that as per a third-party audit of last year’s plantation, the survival rate of saplings has been around 90%-95%. The DDA is already in the process of restoring a part of the floodplains, which includes developing forest and nature trails in different zones of the floodplains. However, forest department officials said that they had already discussed the target with the representatives of the DDA and will hold a meeting with them soon over the issue. According to experts, since the government is looking at a huge target, the maintenance and survival of saplings are of primary importance. CR Babu, professor emeritus at the Centre for Environment Management of Degraded Ecosystems at Delhi University, said, “It is a welcome step. Before they embark on the massive greening exercise, the various agencies must put out the survival rate of the previous plantations and ensure the maintenance of saplings.” He added that developing a floodplains forest would play a huge role in enhancing the water quality of the Yamuna and in maintaining the ecological biodiversity of the river, which must be done at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-aims-at-planting-40-lakh-saplings-highest-so-far/story-VtmI3UiIqcYlY6bFbYEwBL.html

The case was later transferred to NIA. “Lakdawala’s arrest is important considering the number of times he has travelled to Karachi under the guise of conducting cross-border trade, where he used to meet Pakistani spied possible code named as Akbar alias Ali and Rizwan,” said an NIA media releaseAn officer, requesting anonymity, said, “Lakdawala’s role is important considering that he was directly involved in depositing the money into the bank accounts of the Navy personnel at regular intervals through different methods.”The espionage racket started in 2018. The first arrests were made on December 20 when the agencies arrested seven Indian Navy personnel from Visakhapatnam, Mumbai and Karwar bases, along with one hawala operator. Later in February, three more navy personnel were arrested in the case along with one Pakistani-born Indian national Shaista Qaiser.Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agencies had honey-trapped sailors through Facebook, WhatsApp and online dating sites, and were allegedly paid through Indian conduits for getting crucial information regarding positioning of Indian Navy ships and submarines at its critical bases, said sources in the intelligence agencies. The sailors fell for ‘women’ on the dating sites, which were profiles created by ISI, and the women later would introduce them to a businessman who elicited information the sailors, said NIA officials. When the sailor would refrain from revealing information, the ‘women’ would then blackmail them by threatening to reveal their online chats. This way they extracted information about positions and movements of our vessels, added NIA officials.During searches at the house of Lakdawala, several digital devices and incriminating documents were seized by NIA, he said, adding further investigation in the case was underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/operation-dolphin-nose-nia-arrests-key-conspirator-from-mumbai-for-leaking-vital-navy-information/story-2jKcPy3WmY77tRn5O3B9wM.html

The airline decided to shift the official as the current head of the department is set to retire soon.The promotion and transfer order (HT has a copy of it) is dated May 13 and states the officer to be transferred as general manager (GM) of Air India’s medical services in the airline headquarters in New Delhi. “An airline source said, “The said officer heads a region currently and has been asked to join the medical department in Delhi to head it, pan India.”The said officer was posted in Mumbai when the harassment complaint was filed, after which he was transferred to Hyderabad by the then chairman and managing director- Ashwani Lohani.The airline spokesperson said, “These are internal issues on which we would not like to make any comment. Transfer of senior officers is routine administrative exercise as per administrative and operational requirements to ensure optimum utilization of human resources in sync with laid down rules and norms.”Senior Delhi based officials said that the airline decided as their medical services department needs an officer as its current head is set to retire soon.A senior airline official said that the medical services department is playing a key role to serve the country, in the current situation when Air India is operating repatriation flights for the government.Capt.

15-05-2020||Chandigarh||Financial problems of educational institutions will be raised with Centre: MP Manish Tewari||Anandpur Sahib member of Parliament Manish Tewari has assured that he will raise the issue of financial difficulties being faced by educational and technical training institutes amid the Covid-19 lockdown with the central government.Tewari held a meeting with principals and vice-chancellors of different colleges and universities through video conferencing on Friday.Representatives of the educational institutes said they managed to pull through the months of March and April, but now, the situation was out of their control. They said there was no other way to earn revenue for them except charging fees so that they can pay salaries to the teaching and non-teaching staff.They said children from economically weaker sections can be exempted from paying the fees, but those who have the means, must do so. They also demanded for an economic package from the central government, stating that the government has an under-taxation of ₹5 crore for universities, which they should be allowed to use, or must be provided a loan, which they will gradually withdraw later.Tewari assured the representatives that he will try to get their problems resolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/financial-problems-of-educational-institutions-will-be-raised-with-centre-mp-manish-tewari/story-tt2aCMI3zF9th0PRedYKGK.html
15-05-2020||Chandigarh||Now, HC gives Chandigarh admn, MHA 24 hours to reexamine curfew relaxations||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday gave 24 hours to the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) and the Chandigarh administration to examine and make changes if the curfew relaxations by the latter were not in consonance with the ministry’s guidelines.After hearing arguments from the ministry, UT and the petitioner, the high court bench of chief justice RS Jha and justice Arun Palli, while asking UT and MHA to hold a meeting, observed that the issues raised in the petition can be best resolved by the MHA itself, as the import and object of the guidelines can be best understood by it. The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by lawyer Pankaj Chandgothia against lifting of curfew restrictions by UT from May 3.The court expressed its concern about how so many relaxations were granted by the administration that too at a time when the number of cases was rising. It specifically referred to opening of public places, such as Sukhna lake. It also questioned as to how free movement was permitted between 7am and 7pm and almost all kind of shops in neighbourhood markets were allowed to open from 10am to 6pm.During the hearing it also came to light that even as on May 2, parts of certain colonies and sectors were declared as containment zones, subsequently on May 4, the entire areas of Bapu Dham Colony, Sector 38, Sector 52 and Shastri Nagar were decided to be treated as “containment zones”. But no formal order in this regard was issued. On its part, UT told the court that prohibition from Centre was on opening of entertainment parks. Hence, places like Rock Garden were kept closed, but Sukhna lake was opened in line with the MHA guidelines. Senior standing counsel, UT, Pankaj Jain also reasoned that Chandigarh, being the capital of Punjab and Haryana, had a unique administrative positioning, and both Mohali and Panchkula helped in regulating the flow of vehicles. On opening of markets, the court was told that Chandigarh did not have standalone shops, and neighbourhood markets were opened only with odd-even formula to avoid large gatherings.Additional solicitor general of India Satya Pal Jain formally did not file any reply on whether UT’s orders were in violation, but added that all parties had the common objective of defeating Covid-19, and steps taken by UT were also with bona fide object and not with any mala fide intent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/now-hc-gives-chandigarh-admn-mha-24-hours-to-reexamine-curfew-relaxations/story-dZWaBqHXSs1fEpaGQOpPQO.html

15-05-2020||Lucknow||With no export or inter-state trade, Malihabad mangoes headed for Lucknow||Good news for mango lovers. This year the markets will be flush with mangoes. Orchard owners say since mango export and inter-state mango trade have been badly affected following the lockdown and ongoing corona crisis, the mango growers in Malihabad belt have no option than to pump in the supply to the state capital or neighbouring districts. This was also likely to bring down the prices of the luscious Malihabadi Dussehri to as low as Rs 15 per kg.“It’s a double whammy for mango growers. Not only are they battling the lockdown effect on the mango crop but also there is less produce this year. We don’t have any option than to pump in whatever produce we have to Lucknow or neighbouring districts since the traditional buyers from other states haven’t placed any orders this time. But this will only be possible if lockdown opens and there are plenty of vehicles available to facilitate transportation of mangoes,” said Insram Ali, president of All India Mango Growers Association.Ali said Lucknow’s mango belt that also fetched it the title of ‘mango capital’, comprised of Malihabad, Mall and Kakori. “In all three tehsils, the records of the horticulture department suggest mango is produced on 23,589 hectares of land. Mallihabad is said to be the largest contributor to the total mango production (from the mango belt) with over 10,000 hectares of land engaged in mango farming,” he added.He said the lockdown effect had also kept the international buyers at bay. “In UP, every year, the mango growers used to export around 10 tonnes of Dussehri mangoes to the Gulf countries and this time, following the lockdown there are no buyers from abroad,” he added.He said the association had also approached the UP Government, demanding its intervention in saying the mango crop from getting spoiled. “Since mango is a perishable fruit and its shelf live is less than other fruits, hence we need proper transportation to supply the fruits to the nearby markets. Government should facilitate the transportation and should also buy the mango produce in order to save mango growers from bankruptcy,” he said.Dr Shailendra Rajan, director ICAR-Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture (CISH) that aims to train the farmers in getting maximum yield said, “The yield is not as good as last year. But, harvesting and marketing are becoming major challenges for the mango growers as there is extreme shortage of labourers. In other parts of the country also mango growers are facing the same issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/with-no-export-or-inter-state-trade-malihabad-mangoes-headed-for-lucknow/story-q7tSrJpiPcDNQQCpSghh6M.html
15-05-2020||Mumbai||Unlicensed pet shops, dog breeding centres to shut down in Maharashtra post lockdown||Pet shops, dog breeding centres and marketing centres without valid licenses in Maharashtra will not be allowed to remain open post lockdown.The state animal husbandry department issued directives to all district collectors, circulated on Friday, to ensure such centres need to file for fresh registrations before the Maharashtra State Animal Welfare Board (SAWB) at the earliest to ensure they remain functional.“Based on the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act,1960, amended in 2017 and 2018, to include latest guidelines, we have only registered eight pet shops and five dog breeders from Pune, while no other such centres across Maharashtra have been registered so far,” said Dr Prashant Bhad, assistant commissioner, animal husbandry department.At the moment, all pet shops and breeding centres in Mumbai are functioning without our consent, said Dr Bhad. “We have not received the inspection reports for any centres in Mumbai. Based on our clearance, valid centres can apply for registration,” he said.The directive follows an Animal Welfare Board of India’s (AWBI) advisory to ensure pet shops avoid keeping exotic animals while breeding centres follow scientific norms to mitigate the spread of zoonotic diseases. “Animals in pet shops are kept in immunocompromised and unhygienic conditions. Once these rules are enforced, it is less likely that we have zoonotic outbreaks. This is a very positive order and must be followed,” said Ambika Hiranandani, legal advisor to SAWB.The People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India said the state needs to pass orders not to display animals for sale on any online platforms. “When the lockdown was announced many owners left animals and birds locked in their shops to starve and suffer. Violators must be dealt with strictly in accordance with the provisions of the law,” said Meet Ashar, associate manager, emergency response team, PETA India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/unlicensed-pet-shops-dog-breeding-centres-to-shut-down-in-maharashtra-post-lockdown/story-LgkRPs2CqeqRabiqrmh01K.html

The traders, including owners of garment stores, shoes shops, cloth shops etc, said they are reeling under losses as they have to pay electricity bills and salaries to employees, besides meeting other expenses even as their shops have been closed for almost two months now.The different bodies that participated in the flag march, include the district unit of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, Ludhiana Consumer Products Distributors’ Association, among others. Members of the Business Bachao Morcha led by district president of Youth Akali Dal (YAD), Gurdeep Singh Gosha, also participated in the march.Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal district president Arvnder Singh Makkar and Gurdeep Gosha said, “The government has allowed factories to open but factories cannot run for long unless shops are opened for sale. The government should allow shops of all the trades to open so that small traders can cater to their needs and pay the expenses, including electricity bills and salaries of its workers.”Ludhiana consumer products distributors’ association president Harkesh Mittal said,”Due to prolonged lockdown, our staff is also planning to migrate to their native places. We were supporting them morally and financially as of now but if our retail outlets are not opened with immediate effect, our staff is also willing to leave soon. In the absence of skilled staff, opening the shops will become difficult. For a small trader, it will become extremely difficult to look for new labour in these times of crises.”The shopkeepers rued that on hand while the government has allowed liqour vends to open, it has failed to open garment and cloth shops.Model Town market association (regd) president Amarjit Singh said the shopkeepers are ready to follow all the guidelines issued by the government. “The government can impose restrictions on timings for opening the shops but it should take steps to bring some relief to the traders. The shopkeepers will follow all the guidelines and maintain social distancing at their respective shops,” said Singh.The district administration has, so far, allowed opening of shops selling essential goods such as electric fans, air conditioners (ACs) and its repair shops, electricians, supply of books, stationery shops, vehicle repair and supply of spare parts, supply of electrical and sanitary goods, supply of construction material such as cement, bricks, sand, plywood, glass etc, supply of inverters, plumber and carpenter services and supply of hardware and paints.

15-05-2020||City||HT Chandigarh debate: Those who can afford it should pay school fees during the lockdown, say residents||SCHOOLS MUST BE GIVEN SOME RELAXATIONS TOOPrivate schools have to take care of their own finances and provide quality education to students. Their contribution must be recognised and in the present scenario, some relaxation must be given to them. It is desirable that the heads of private schools discuss the issue with the director, school education, Chandigarh. Usha Verma, ChandigarhGOVERNMENT SHOULD FUND SCHOOLSIt is not a good idea to expect private schools not to take fees from students and hold back the salaries of teachers, who work hard and are also conducting online classes now. However, to find a middle path, some fee concession should be given to parents facing financial problems. Schools need money to pay the salaries of teachers and non-teaching staff and to look after other expenses such as maintenance and upkeep of buildings, electricity and other costs. If the government does not want them to take tuition fee then it should fund the schools.Saikrit Gulati, ChandigarhDON’T MAKE PARENTS PAY FOR FACILITIES NOT USEDI’m a parent and my children study in a private school in Chandigarh. It seems neither the school education department nor schools want to focus on real issues during this time of the pandemic. - Schools are only interested in full fee and want it paid as soon as possible- Schools are least bothered about teachers and their salaries. In most schools teachers are paid peanuts and are on yearly contract so they don’t have to be paid gratuity and many have unqualified teachers. Very few schools have teachers with Central Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET) qualification in Chandigarh- No school wants to share its balance sheet and details of FDs- No school in the current situation is asking parents to go for National Council for Educational Research and Training books and most parents sooner than later have to buy books from the school or the booksellers they remember. This loot is going on for years but there isn’t any strong law or action.While the education department asked parents not to pay fees till the lockdown was lifted, many parents think schools need funds for salaries and other small expenses. However, when I paid the fee last month, I noticed the schools were charging development fee (Rs 5,000-plus), One time fee (Rs 400-plus), computer lab fee and other lab fee as well (Rs. 1000-plus). Many parents are fine with tuition fee but when children are not using school infrastructure why should schools should charge lab fees and development fee at least during the lockdown?DineshCHARGE FEES ON PRO RATA BASISSchools authorities should charge fees on pro rata basis to meet unavoidable expenses incurred during the lockdown. At the same time they should display their income and expenditure statements on notice boards or websites for transparency. The schools can also afford to meet the liabilities from the reserve funds they have been creating. In future they should be vigilant to curtail expenses according to the changed times.S K Gupta, MohaliCONSIDER EACH FAMILY’S SITUATIONI am a student of Panjab University and had been a student of a private school in Chandigarh, so I feel I am a perfect candidate to answer the question on schools charging fees during the lockdown. According to me the school fees is divided into many sub-parts such as the tuition fee, transport fee, lab fee, infrastructure fee, activity fee, admission fee and so on. During the lockdown only the tuition fees should be taken from the students to pay the teachers. There is no point in taking full fees from the parents as their children are not using some services. Also taking private tuitions and coaching classes into account, same rules should be imposed on them. Many parents who have their own businesses have negligible sources of income nowadays, so each family’s financial situation has to be considered. Ridhima Gupta, Student of University Institute of Engineering and Technology, ChandigarhAUDIT SCHOOL ACCOUNTSThis is not the end of the world for private schools. Students should get a fee waiver as education is the fundamental right of every citizen . As far as salaries of teachers are concerned audit of the accounts of the schools should be done by the regulatory authority to see how much money the schools have in reserve for necessary expenditure.Rajesh Mehta SHARE THE BURDEN EQUALLYA lockdown for such a long period is the first of its kind which is now leading to an economic slowdown all over the country. Under such trying and testing conditions it is the moral duty of every citizen and institution to respond positively to the best of their ability. Teachers and other school staff must be paid salaries. Likewise, parents must pay fees to schools as the institutes cannot bear the whole burden. Let us share the burden equally. Paramjeet SinghPARENTS WHO CAN AFFORD TO SHOULD PAY THE FEEMany parents will find it tough to pay the school fees during the lockdown. We know how badly the country has been faring economically in the last few months. Paying school fees in this situation will be tough. Even though some relaxations have been given by the government to allow people to run their businesses, many have not fully opened up. If we look the industries, only a few workers are allowed to work. That’s why many people do not have the money to pay fees. However, the schools are in a similar situation, some need money to pay teachers and cover other expenses. The best thing to do would be for schools not to charge fees but parents who can afford to do so should give it and others should not be pressurised. Schools running short of funds should be given half salaries to meet day to day costs.Manoj Pillai THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO MAKE PROFITSKeeping in mind that this period is a very sensitive time having direct implication on economic instability of individuals it is suggested that no fee be charged during the lockdown period. If schools do require the money urgently they should charge fees on a monthly basis, that too without any additional administrative charges. Some schools should also consider fee waivers as this is not the time to make profits but to act on humanitarian grounds as well.Ramandeep Kaur Bhogal, MohaliSCHOOLS SHOULD SET EXAMPLESThe primary responsibility of a school is to educate students. This is the time for institutes to help out the youngsters and their families by charging a basic fee for salaries of teaching and non-teaching staff and not for services and facilities not being used by the students. Ask for fees to be paid on a voluntary basis – those who have the financial resources to do so should pay. Form a fee pool and ask parents who can to contribute for additional expenses. Reach out to alumni for help. Do everything possible to generate funds to keep the school going, but not to make a profit.AK Gupta||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ht-chandigarh-debate-those-who-can-afford-it-should-pay-school-fees-during-the-lockdown-say-residents/story-ZXEBnPUFBAaiumXzXLdT6M.html

According to Principal Secretary, Health, Sanjay Kumar, five of the cases were reported from Khagaria district, while one person tested positive in Siwan. All of them are adult males.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage The state had reported its first couple of cases on March 22 and the tally crossed the 100-mark on April 19. The steep rise in incidence since then has been attributed, to some extent, to influx of migrants who have been returning to their native places in droves, by the ‘Shramik Special’ trains or hired vehicles. Bihar Health Department has put the number of “migrants testing positive” between May 4 and May 15 (till 10 AM) at 358. A total of 2.46 lakh people have come to the state by the rail route, ever since the first Bihar-bound ‘Shramik Special’ reached Danapur on May 2, officials said. Government officials coming in close contact with infected people have also been found to be vulnerable to the infection. The department on Friday confirmed that a young IAS officer of 2017 batch, posted in Nalanda district, was among those who had tested positive on Tuesday. In addition, more than 30 police personnel have tested positive across the state, 21 of them from Bihar Military Polices 14th battalion at Khajpura locality in Patna, where an infection chain was triggered with over 20 residents of a by-lane Bijli Gali having tested positive last month. Nonetheless, Bihar boasts of a good recovery rate and a low mortality rate. Till Friday morning, the number of those who have recovered stood at 412. Only seven persons have died most of them with co-morbidities the figure being a tiny fraction of the nationwide fatalities, though the state comprises 10 per cent of the country’s population. The number of samples tested so far is 43,371, the department said. With the recent spurt, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has been making efforts to drastically raise the daily average of testing currently at around 1,800 samples to 10,000 or more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/covid-19-tally-breaches-four-digit-mark-in-bihar/story-ljliCyfWjBl1ePXk8BvlSI.html

The teachers are warned of action if they failed to join duty, according to a civic official.Meenakshi Raut, PMC school board administrative officer, issued the notices to these teachers on Thursday (May 14) directing them to join duty immediately or face suspension.Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal had suspended 12 teachers a few weeks earlier for failing to join the survey work.The notice issued by Raut states that “as these teachers are not participating in the survey work, the health department submitted the report. The school board has issued them a final notice and forwarded the to additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal for final action”.Vaishali Jadhav, PMC assistant health chief who is incharge of survey work, said, “A total of 944 teams are carrying out door-to-door survey in the city and the fourth round is on. With many teachers remaining absent, it becomes tough to make alternate arrangement for survey work. Some teachers are not joining duty despite giving reminders. Hence, we gave the report to additional municipal commissioner.”Jadhav said that at least 3,000 staff are involved in the survey work.The survey work is going on under the leadership of Jadhav in the city. The survey teams include staff from health department, various departments of PMC and teachers from school board.The survey teams visit houses and take information from residents regarding symptoms related to Covid-19 and also guide them regarding the flu centres set up by the civic body. The teams also carry out contact tracing of Covid-19 positive cases and immediately send them for screening.One of the health department officer on condition of anonymity said, “As there is panic regarding Covid-19, teachers are avoiding the duties by giving various reasons. As health department staff are aware of the medical situation, they are doing the duty seriously.”One of the teachers who got the notice said, “For every work, the government involves teachers. The survey work poses health risk. I have small kids and no one is at home to take care of them. Who will look after my children when I am out for survey duty with no maid coming at home? Even parents are not allowed at home to look after kids because of the lockdown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/79-civic-teachers-to-face-suspension-for-not-participating-in-coronavirus-survey-work/story-3oF8mg5xOCgplgloaIqHGO.html

The 38-year-old of Azizpur village says he learns with his children. “I am lucky to be part of my children’s education. The videos are so interesting that even I like to watch them,” he said.Every morning at 9, videos land in 20,000 WhatsApp grounds across the state through which the education department delivers e-content for digital learning. The groups are named SMILE, acronym for department’s initiative called Social Media Interface for Learning Engagement.“Education department has launched several initiatives to ensure continuous learning for all students through digital means in this crisis period. The department’s objective is to keep students engaged at home and to prevent learning gaps in this crisis period,” said Manju Rajpal, secretary of school education department.SMILE programme is one of those initiatives. All students of Class 1 to 12 get 30-40 minutes of e-content at 9am in WhatsApp groups of their parents. “Children in 13 lakh households and 3.4 lakh teachers are connected with the programme through the WhatsApp groups,” Rajpal said.Government teachers are mandated to call five parents or students every day to motivate the child to watch videos and clear any doubts that they may have in the e-content. “Teachers have a personal connect with their students and their calls will add immense value to our efforts in creating impact,” the secretary said. Many teachers, like Singh of Sriganganagar, go around the village to remind parents about the video every morning.On Saturdays, there’s a quiz to test e-learning. Panchayat-level education officers (PEEO) have created two groups each; one is for parents and the second, for teachers. The e-content is reviewed by a team of experts at Rajasthan State Council of Education Research and Training (RSCERT), state’s academic body. The department’s digital library currently has over 500 videos and is publically available through the SMILE YouTube channel for any child to access.Rajpal said the department has received more than 1,000 videos from teachers from every district across grades and competencies since the programme was launched on April 9 during the lockdown to prevent spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19).For students who don’t have access to internet, the department has launched a radio programme called Shikshavani. This is a one-hour broadcast on 25 stations of All India Radio, which begins at 11am. “The content includes interesting stories and recordings on life-skills for children,” Rajpal said.Education minister Govind Singh Dotasara held a video conference on Thursday to review the programmes. More than 4,000 officials of the department attended the review.“We have received feedback from over 2.5 lakh parents, students and teachers on the e-content. 92% students and parents reported to like the material being sent and found it beneficial. 96% teachers reported to like the e-content,” the minister said after the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/rajasthan-students-learning-with-smile-during-lockdown/story-mPOlFMXklxgVcUeisqJlIM.html

15-05-2020||Mumbai||Don’t use 3 Mahul buildings as Covid-19 quarantine facilities without court’s nod: Bombay high court to Mumbai civic body||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to not use the vacant buildings at Mahul – meant for resettlement of project-affected persons (PAPs) – as quarantine centres for suspected Covid-19 patients without permission from the court.The bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Amjad Sayed passed the order, even as BMC stated that the three empty buildings at the Mahul PAP Colony, also known as Eversmile Complex, will be used only as a last resort, if the suspected coronavirus patients could not be accommodated elsewhere in the M-West ward.The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) jointly filed by Sharda Tevar – the mother of an undertrial prisoner lodged at Arthur Road jail – and a non-governmental organisation (NGO) – Ghar Bachao Ghar Banao Andolan – which is working along with the homeless, slum dwellers and marginalised communities on housing, food and water rights issues.The petitioners contended that Mahul is the most unsuitable area in the city to quarantine Covid-19 patients and suspects, as residents in the locality develop a variety of health issues, particularly severe respiratory problems, and it will be counter-productive to quarantine Covid-19 patients at PAP Colony.Their PIL stated that patients suffering from Covid-19 already have severely compromised immunities, which manifest in severe respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia. So sending suspected Covid-19 patients to Mahul would defeat the very purpose of quarantining them and would instead accelerate their respiratory ailments, and could even prove to be fatal to such patients.“Indeed, others who have been rehabilitated to Mahul in the past have reported a series of severe respiratory ailments like asthma and tuberculosis within a short period of moving to Mahul,” the PIL said.According to the petitioners’ counsel, advocate Ronita Bector, three judicial forums have declared the PAP Colony to be uninhabitable because of the high levels of industrial pollution and the toxic air quality, and HC had last year in September restrained the state government from shifting any slum dweller or PAP at Eversmile Complex.In response to the petition, BMC has filed an affidavit stating that the number of Covid-19 positive cases is likely to go up to 2,946 in the M-West ward, where Mahul is located, and 70℅ of the cases are expected to be from densely-populated areas, such as slums. It adds that considering 10 contacts of every patient would likely be quarantined, the municipal corporation will have to arrange for a quarantine facility for around 30,000 people, and in the view of an extreme shortage of space for quarantine facilities, it had decided to use the three buildings.The affidavit further stated that the civic body has identified three completely vacant buildings at Eversmile Complex for accommodating 1,100 high-risk and low-risk contacts. But the buildings will be used only as a last resort and only if the number of Covid-19 patients in the ward increases and their contacts could not be quarantined elsewhere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/don-t-use-3-mahul-buildings-as-covid-19-quarantine-facilities-without-court-s-nod-hc-to-bmc/story-aVqSMpC8u2XrSMF8TwCQ9I.html

Authorities had a tough time managing the rush of migrants apart from regular patients. No trains are running from Kapurthala and migrants are going to Jalandhar to board the train. Workers are allowed to deposit their travel forms when found healthy, which makes them eligible to board the special trains.Dr Sandeep Dhawan of the civil hospital said around 4,000 migrants had been screened and given a fitness certification. “Most come after applying online while some come directly but we are screening all migrants,” said Dhawan.“A large number of migrant workers queued up in hospitals in Phagwara. Around 250 migrants were examined till afternoon and hospital authorities had to deploy a staff member with a loudspeaker to appeal to the migrants to maintain distance,” said senior medical officer Kamal Kishor.The state government is running free trains to Daltonganj in Jharkhand, Katni in Madhya Pradesh, Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, Gajipur and Banaras in UP, Lucknow, Gorakhpur and Ayodhya, Azamgarh, Darbhanga, Bahraich, Sultanpur, Mujaffar Nagar, Akbarpur, Sultanpur, Barkakhana, Azamgarh, Faizabad, Gorakhpur, Sitapur, Rai Bareli, Pratapgarh, Unnao, to Mau in Uttar Pradesh and Bettiah, Darbhanga, Katihar, Gaya and Chapra in Bhiar from Jalandhar.

15-05-2020||Delhi||Lockdown hits street smartness stray animals, leads to spike in accidents||Focusing on the bigger picture often leads to the neglection of everyday, seemingly banal things, and something similar is happening with stray puppies who were born just before the lockdown was announced. These puppies, in search of food, run towards cars thinking that they are feeders, and often end up getting run over. “Lot of these babies were born just before the lockdown and started emerging a month ago. There’s hardly any traffic and the streets are like highways for them. They move freely without looking out and get run over by cars. Even the older dogs, who had knowledge of traffic and would sit on the sides, are now sitting in the middle of the roads. These dogs have lost their sense of traffic,” says, Amritika Phool, a Gurugram resident who is involved in animal welfare work. Another menace is the lack of understanding of animal behavior on the people’s part. “People who have sympathy, but don’t really understand their behavior, throw food from moving cars towards them. This leads them to think that any car that’s slowing down might have food for them. This is bringing dogs to the roads, leading to accidents,” adds Phool. Read: Feeder passes to feed strays come as a relief amid lockdownGurugram, with its leafy stretches near the Aravali Biodiversity Park, has a flourishing wildlife, which is on the periphery of danger. “Since the lockdown, I have seen injured puppies or piglets who have been run over. Their mothers are howling on the road. Sometimes, they run after the cars in anger because they don’t know any other way to express,” says Akanksha Pundir, an entrepreneur from Gurugram.The authorities have stepped up and are helping residents involved in feeding and taking care of the strays, “The Haryana Police has been incredible. I asked them if they will feed the dogs if I deposited the food with them and they agreed. I regularly check with them and leave food once every week. We also fixed a tub for water for cows near the Arjangarh border stretch,” shares Pundir.  Our Day 47 of #feedingstrays in #Delhi. And today let's show you some puppy love! Aren't they simply adorable? Please feed stray animals around you. Also leave a bowl of water. #AnimalsArePeopleToo #BeKind #OneKindAct #StayHome #lockdownindia pic.twitter.com/95fsjM3vH0The animals will switch to auto-reconditioning once the lockdown is over but that will still take time. One probable solution is controlling their population. “The government has to get actively involved in sterilization and do this before the mating cycle.

15-05-2020||Chandigarh||Activists, locals oppose Kinnaur’s Kashang Hydro Power Project||Activists and locals in Kinnaur have asked the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) to not extend environment clearance to the integrated Kashang Hydro Project. Around 1,000 environmental activists from across the world and local residents have written to the ministry raising concern over the ecological damage the will be caused due to the project.They alleged that on April 30 this year, a portion of a mountain near the project caved in destroying apple orchards and killing one Nepali migrant worker in Pangi village.“This area in the high Himalayas, falling in the Satluj Valley, is known for its geological and ecological vulnerability, and is also the site of Stage 1 of the 243 MW-Integrated Kashang Hydropower Project, which is already operational,” said a Sushil Sagar Negi, a local and president of Paryavaran Sanrakshan Sangharsh Smiti. “Stage II, III and IV of the project will come up on the same mountain, which will spell doom for our lives, livelihoods and biodiversity,” he said. The MoEFCC had granted an Environment Clearance to the four-stage project back in April 2010 with the condition of 10-year validity.Only stage I of the project has been completed within the deadline by the Himachal Pradesh Hydropower Corporation Limited (HPPCL), which now is seeking an extension.The Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the ministry is due to discuss the matter today.Manshi Asher, convener of Himadhara Environment Collective, said that their petition to the Union ministry raises some important points to buttress their demand.The petition claims that underground blasting and tunnelling for hydropower projects disturb the local geology and soil erosion triggering slope failures and exacerbating landslides in an area, which is already disaster prone. It alleges that lack of safety compliance and non-accountability by HPPCL means that locals have to bear the cost of the damages to fields, farms, forests and human lives.“The project is a threat to the local ecology, floral and faunal biodiversity as it falls in the Lippa Asrang Wildlife Sanctuary, home to the Himalayan Brown Bear and endangered Snow leopard. The eco-sensitive zone is also rich in floral biodiversity. However, the environment impact assessment report submitted a decade ago does not mention this,” villagers alleged in the petition.They also alleged that it also poses a threat to tribal livelihoods and land-based economy and more than 1,000 families, who depend on horticulture and cultivation of cash crops such as peas, potatoes and kidney beans and forest produce like Chilgoza pines and kala jeera.The submission also alleges violation of the Forest Rights Act and Tribal Laws. The individual and community rights of Lippa village are yet to be settled despite an NGT order. They said that the project is also financially non-viable due costs overruns in the first phase.“A CAG report has slammed the HPPCL for initiating work without approval from the gram sabha and increasing the financial risk to the project,” said the petition.It submits that the Kashang Project has almost no economic benefits and humongous ecological, livelihood and social costs.“Allowing the project is an invitation to more disasters in the fragile Himalayas, already bearing the load of the climate crisis,” it concluded.Some of the prominent signatories, include Medha Patkar, Prafulla Samantara, Himanshu Thakkar, Ashish Kothari and Roma Malik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/activists-locals-oppose-kinnaur-s-kashang-hydro-power-project/story-P838PSeWTkpwL2X64nDsiK.html

The epicentre was in Pitampura in North-West Delhi, PTI reported.This comes nearly a week after an earthquake of 3.4 magnitude struck near Sonia Vihar in North-East Delhi. Tremors were felt in parts of the national capital and the adjoining areas after the earthquake.No casualty or loss of property was reported. The quake occurred at a depth of five kilometres.This was the third earthquake in the national capital amid the nationwide coronavirus lockdown. Delhi witnessed two back-to-back incidents of low-intensity earthquakes in April with same location and nearby areas as the epicentre.On April 12, a moderate intensity quake of magnitude 3.5 hit the national capital at a depth of 8 km. The very next day, another low-intensity earthquake of magnitude 2.7 shook parts of Delhi. The earthquake, with its epicentre near Wazirpur in northeast Delhi, occurred at 1.26 pm at a shallow depth of 5 km, said JL Gautam, Head (Operations) at NCS, an institute under the Ministry of Earth Sciences.Of the four seismic zones in the country - Zone II, III, IV, V - Delhi falls under ‘Zone IV’. “Of these, Zone V is seismically the most active region, while zone II is the least,” says a release on country’s seismic zones by the Ministry of Earth Science.The national capital is vulnerable to earthquakes but it is rare for it to be the epicentre of a quake. Delhi, however, experiences tremors when a quake hits regions as far as central Asia or the Himalayan ranges, known to be a high-seismic zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/low-intensity-earthquake-hits-pitampura-in-delhi-fourth-in-more-than-a-month/story-HOAM9FcGVDxOTgYh1BdMCI.html

15-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh residents rue shifting of wholesale mandi from Sector 26 to ISBT-17||After the wholesale vegetable and fruit market was shifted from Sector 26 to the Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT) in Sector 17, many residents have complained that the mandi has become a source of noise pollution and garbage accumulation.As per Subhash Narang, president of the Sector 22-B market opposite to ISBT-17, in just a couple of days, the new location has become a nuisance. “Though most of the shops are closed, the parking of our market is already full with the carts of the vendors. These are also lined up outside affecting the flow of traffic.” He added that garbage could be seen strewn all across ISBT premises on Thursday.NOISE WOES HIT ADJOINING SECTORSOrganizing secretary of the Sector 21 RWA Sandeep Bhalla said, “From 5am onwards, the mandi comes alive. Police vehicles use loudspeakers when patrolling the area and the noise affects the sleep cycles of many residents.”Bhalla added that some vendors came to the sector without necessary passes. “Two entry points to Sector 21 are blocked but still vendors manage to come through. They don’t possess necessary passes and most of them don’t even wear masks properly.”The Federation of Sector Welfare Associations of Chandigarh (FOSWAC) has sent a letter regarding this to the UT administration and the police and said they will meet the officials on Monday after public dealing resumes in government offices.RESIDENTS FEEL UNSAFEGeneral secretary of the Sector 18 RWA Kamaljit Singh Panchii said many residents were fearful of being so close to a mandi where hundreds of vendors came daily. “On the first day, a tea seller was taken away for displaying flu-like symptoms. He was already inside the mandi and wasn’t even thermally screened. The administration needs to establish only one entry and exit point so that residents can stay assured that suspected Covid patients are not allowed to enter the mandi.” He added that it would be best if the mandi was shifted to the Sector 39 grain market site as it is at the periphery of the city and better suited.Meanwhile, officials said the mandi had been shifted owing to a number of positive cases coming up in Bapu Dham Colony in Sector 26. “The shift is temporary and the premises are sanitized daily.” UT adviser Manoj Parida has also issued an order under which the traders will have to pay for any damage to the infrastructure of ISBT including dumping of garbage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-residents-rue-shifting-of-wholesale-mandi-from-sector-26-to-isbt-17/story-yf9WP8Kv6JGKfXGAqU7h0M.html

A video of the incident went viral on social networking sites, following which the police recorded the statements of the victim and the accused for further action.Deepak Uppal, husband of Congress councillor from ward number 21, Kitty Uppal, was seen in the video beating the man, Sundar, with sticks. Uppal said he came to know that Sundar, claiming himself to be his brother, was taking around 100 labourers to Khanna in 10 vehicles parked near the spot without any permission or social distancing measure. “When my friend Subash Kumar and I objected, and asked to produce a permit, Sundar, who was inebriated at that point, opened attack on me,” Uppal said, adding that he thrashed him in self-defense and handed him over to the police. Sundar, however, alleged that Uppal had thrashed him for no reason and the police personnel standing nearby just stayed mute spectators.Moti Nagar station house officer inspector Varunjit Singh said, “Sundar was taking labourers in vehicles without permission. He assaulted Uppal and his friend Subhash, while accusing Uppal of thrashing him.

15-05-2020||Delhi||Online exams really an option? DU students say nay||Limited broadband access, the existing digital divide and a dearth of laptops and computers are among the major concerns being raised by the students of Delhi University (DU), who are vehemently opposing the idea of online examinations. Some students have been vocal about their concerns towards the possibility of exams being conducted on an online platform or open-book examination, and others feel that the environment of lockdown is too stressful to study. “Bachhon ke paas laptops hi nahi hai. Many of my friends aren’t that technologically advanced to even know how to operate computers and laptops. Visually impaired students will have problems if they are not assisted by helpers as they are used to being helped by technicians in computer labs in colleges. This is the ground reality of the campus,” says Sanjay Kataria, a final year masters student of DU. Students claim that since online classes weren’t much of a success, online exams seem a far cry. “My friends from Jammu and Kashmir have suffered because of the poor internet conditions there. How can we even think of online exams when we are not even able to attend online classes because of the present internet connectivity problems all over India,” asks Amal K Simon, a final year graduation student of Ramjas College. Lacking clarity about how and where the online exams will be conducted, final year students worry about getting their degrees much later, and therefore expect a delay in getting placements, if any available due to the slow down in the economy. “The authorities have to develop a special software where students can’t do any malpractices... But then also, the question of availability of internet for everyone remains! Online exams is not an option,” says Sneha Sarah Shaji, a final year student of Hindu College.

Reeling under losses, the industry has been demanding permission to operate in mix land use areas for over two weeks. Different industrial organisations, including Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (CICU), Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation and Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association (JNSSMA), had even warned the state government of agitation if it failed to allow industrial activity in mix land use areas by May 17.The industry rued that the large industry allowed to operate in designated areas would not be able to survive as it was dependent on micro and small industry. The matter was also raised by congress MLAs Surinder Dawar and Sanjay Talwar in a meet held with the additional chief secretary, industries and commerce, Vini Mahajan on Thursday. President of JNSSMA, Jaswinder Singh Thukral, and president of FICO, Gurmeet Singh Kular, said the decision was welcomed as around 50,000 micro and small units (mostly cycle parts, tools and hosiery) were situated in mix land use and non-designated areas of the city.Thukral said, “I had also raised the issue in the meet held with Vini Mahajan at Bachat Bhawan on Thursday as the industry is reeling under losses even when they can operate by complying with all the guidelines on the basis of which the medium and large industry has been allowed to operate in designated areas.”The industrialists rued that apart from losses, they have also been losing their labour, which was moving back to their home states in absence of work.Representing hosiery industry, president of Knitwear and Textile Club, Vinod Thapar, and president of Bajwa Nagar Hosiery Association, Darshan Dawar, said the labour had started movement and if the labour in the hosiery industry had moved out, it would have been a major blow to the industry.“The hosiery industry has already suffered a loss of over Rs 1,000 crore due to the lockdown and the decision by the state government to allow operations in mix land use areas has provided a much needed relief,” said Thapar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-industry-hails-state-s-decision-to-allow-operations-in-mix-land-use-areas/story-Y23qDEEEtrqi8Aij2WZ5RL.html

15-05-2020||City||Journey of migrants from Maharashtra not easy amid lockdown||On Wednesday morning, three days after he had left from Goregaon, Lakshmi Morya reached Asaipur in Uttar Pradesh (UP) after having spent the last of his savings — ₹3,000 — to get a place on a truck crowded with migrant labourers and daily wagers. “It was a horrible journey,” said Morya, recalling how one of the 50-odd passengers fell off the truck and injured himself. These travellers are among the thousands of migrant workers who are leaving the city out of desperation, after the nationwide lockdown was imposed in March to contain the spread of Covid-19.There are an estimated 6 lakh migrant workers in Maharashtra who have been given food and shelter in relief camps set up by the state government since March. For those who survive on daily wages and worked in cities like Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nagpur, Nashik and Kolhapur, the lockdown has meant their sources of earning have dried up. During the lockdown, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region has witnessed an unprecedented reverse migration of labour. “With lockdown, there was no business or earning. There was no ration-paani to live by. At least in my village, I wouldn’t have to worry about the next meal,” said Mahfooz Husain, who worked as an autorickshaw driver in Mumbai and made a 60-hour journey to UP on Monday afternoon. He is now quarantined on the borders of his home in Tapni village and is not sure if he will return to Mumbai once the lockdown eases.“The hardship with which people have left is disturbing. It could also mean that people will not want to return for a long time,” said Tahir Momin, a power loom owner and former legislator. Momin said in Bhiwandi, one of India’s largest textile hubs, approximately 70% of its labour force had left the state during the lockdown. Despite some transport being arranged to take migrants back to home states, many feel they cannot afford to wait as long as it takes to avail the special train and bus services. “The entire stretch of the western express highway along Mira-Bhayander road is lined with migrant workers, most on foot, going home to UP, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar. They are carrying whatever little they have and walking with their families,” said Shailesh Mishra, a social worker who has been distributing food and water to labourers in the area.On Thursday morning, hundreds of migrant labourers gathered on the highway in Kolhapur district and as the crowd swelled, police had to be deployed. Superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh said those who had gathered were not aggressive and were mostly labourers who had applied for seats on the Shramik Special trains that are returning migrants to their home states. “They were impatient because they were not allowed to travel but others, who were with them, had got to do so. So they took to the streets to demand [transportation],” said Deshmukh.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has approved ₹54.75 crore from his relief fund for travel arrangements to take migrant labourers to their home states and bring back those from Maharashtra who are currently stranded elsewhere. Shramik Special trains are plying from different cities in Maharashtra and Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has arranged buses that take migrant labourers to state borders, free of charge. “We have so far taken 79,000 migrants up to our borders with Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, and Karnataka,” said MSRTC vice-chairman and managing director Shekhar Channe.However, these options involve long waits. Autorickshaw driver Vijay Yadav, who wants to return to Jaunpur in UP, is waiting to hear back about his application for a seat on a Shramik Special train. “It’s been 15 days since I filled my form. I have no money, no food,” said Yadav. For those who can afford to pay between ₹3,000 and ₹6,000, travel by truck seems the quickest option. Sunil Yadav, from the non-governmental organisation Pani Haq Samiti in Mumbai, said he sees two trucks filled with workers leave from Goregaon every day.Sandeep Kumar, who has worked as a carpenter in Mumbai since 2015 and lived in Ghatkopar, said he and six others, walked from Ghatkopar to Thane from where they got on autorickshaws to Bhiwandi. At Bhiwandi, they were able to get passage on a truck, paying ₹3,000 per head. The journey to Hariya in UP took three days and in this time, Kumar ate twice. “We saw a lot and struggled a lot even to reach back to our homes,” said Kumar, who is nevertheless relieved to be home. “I do not think I will return anytime soon to Mumbai. I will work in Hariya,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/journey-of-migrants-from-maharashtra-not-easy-amid-lockdown/story-9fzl0lD4cpI6kQHzU4KefI.html

The CM also told the MLAs to coordinate with panchayat pradhans and other party functionaries of the area to make arrangements for quarantine of the returnees.CM Thakur also said that the coronavirus lockdown has adversely affected the economy of the country as well as the hill state. “Now, steps must be taken at local level to take up developmental works and start economic activities,” he said, adding that the state would be immensely benefitted by Rs 20 lakh crore package announced by the Centre as almost 90% of the state’s industry falls under the micro, small and medium enterprises category.Highlighting his government’s measures taken up for benefit of the working class, the CM said, “The government had also decided to enhance the upper income ceiling for the selection of below poverty line beneficiaries to Rs 45,000. This will increase the number of households under the National Food Security Act by 1.5 lakh, thereby, making them eligible for subsidised ration.State BJP president Rajiv Bindal lauded the efforts of the state government to combat the pandemic and said, “It was due to the efforts of the government that Himachal Pradesh is among the least affected states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sensitise-people-of-your-areas-about-coronavirus-himachal-cm-tells-bjp-mlas/story-pNnKQRp5YFvbUeANKwMbcL.html

By Thursday evening, several wine shops had opened in the district. Neeraj Kapoor, a liquor contractor, said, “The contractors have decided to open the vends for now, as the government has assured to look into their grievances.”Leading a group of contractors in the district, Varinder Sharma said only over-the-counter sales would be done and there will be no home delivery.There are around 750 vends in the district, including those in Khanna, Samrala and Jagraon. The state government earns an annual revenue of around ₹1,100 crore from liquor vends, which comes to over ₹3 crore on a daily basis. The government had allowed the contractors to open the vends on May 6, but they had been demanding compensation for the losses incurred in the last financial year due to imposition of curfew on March 23 and review of excise policy 2020-2021 including withdrawal of quota condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/liquor-vends-to-open-in-ludhiana-no-home-delivery/story-NT7wVrHCNrNk5pzm0dKlFM.html

Several adaptive trials have been conducted in these districts and have indicated very good prospects,” he added.He also mentioned that these advanced varieties meet the total rice recovery (out-turn ratio) of raw rice fixed at 67% under the ‘Custom Milling Policy’ fixed by the Government of India and have acceptable levels comparable to other varieties for various quality parameters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-advises-farmers-on-non-basmati-varieties/story-T0Yec1eDOkrRhd4GWrdpOK.html

The national carrier is operating the Vande Bharat Mission flights to bring home Indians stranded abroad owing to the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent suspension of airline services.One of the passengers, who is a diabetes patient, said he and around 50 other passengers quarantined at a five-star were made to pay a lump sum amount of Rs 87,000 each for their stay.“Why should we bear this cost unnecessarily? The flight ticket cost per head was Rs 49,660. I have already spent almost Rs 2 lakh in a matter of five days for my wife and me,” the 60-year-old retired government official said.According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), all international passengers arriving in the city are being sent to hotels for institutional quarantine, while those reporting symptoms at the airport are sent to isolation wards in hospitals. These instructions are issued when the flights are booked giving passengers a choice to decide the hotel they would like to stay in.The senior citizen, however, clarified that while he was aware about the mandatory quarantine, he had chosen a relatively cheaper hotel.Also Read: Indian Covid-19 vaccine development to be backed by PM-CARES“Our hotel was changed to a five-star one in Santacruz at the last minute and we had no say on it because the district collector’s staff had taken over the process from BMC, creating confusion. The entire process is being handled in an unprofessional manner without consulting experts,” the passenger said.Another passenger, a 46-year-old Thane resident with kidney ailment, was taken to a hotel closer to his residence. “My parents are heart patients and I returned from London to take care of them. I am currently 15 minutes away from home but can only speak to my family over the phone. I have already paid Rs 63,000 for the isolation period,” he said.One of the other passengers said that even low-risk fliers were being quarantined. “I am not a threat to my neighbours as I live alone. I was identified as low-risk passenger at the airport. There is no need for me to be at a hotel but we have no option,” said the 32-year-old woman, who is a Khar resident. The BMC admitted that there were certain issues cited after the first flight from London landed, but directions were passed to resolve them.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“At one of hotels, the accommodation was full, and one group of passengers faced problems. But they were accommodated at a similar category hotel with almost the same charges,” said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.“After passengers claimed that they were being asked to pay the entire amount for 14 days, we instructed the hoteliers’ association to charge accommodation fees in four different instalments. Passengers now may not pay at one go. The problems were only faced for passengers in the first flight. Thereafter, 10 five-star hotels are now offering rooms at a concessional rate for Rs 4000 inclusive of all meals and facilities per day.” Meanwhile, the passengers also claimed that they had a harrowing experience after landing at Mumbai airport. The retired government official said that he and his wife were made to wait for four-and-a-half hours at the airport before being taken to the hotel even though they did not have any symptoms of the Sars-Cov-2 virus. “We landed at 1.30pm and reached our hotel at 6pm. At the airport, my wife sat on a wheel chair while I was standing throughout,” he said.Also Read: India Inc backs labour code plan on minimum wageThe senior citizen explained how the norms of social distancing or using adequate protective equipment were not followed at the airport. “Most airport officials we reached out for help were not wearing masks or gloves. There was no coordination, no proper distancing and confusion over going from one section to another. A day after our flight, we read reports that one of the airport staff was tested positive for Covid-19. My wife and I are both scared that we may have contracted the virus at the airport,” he said.Officials from Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) said the entire process was being handled by the Airport Health Organisation (APHO) with instructions from the Centre.“As this was the first flight, there were some issues. However, following improvisations, the process is much smoother now,” said an MIAL spokesperson, adding that the passenger movement was staggered, as the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) did not allow anyone to move from one section to another until they followed the mandated process.“All the airport staff are using personal protective equipment without which CISF does not allow them to enter. It took passengers more time to leave the airport as every process – from screening, filling self- declaration forms, downloading the government app, immigration, customs and identifying allotted hotels for quarantine – were monitored carefully,” the spokesperson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/we-were-made-to-pay-entire-amount-for-14-day-quarantine-period-at-hotels-say-vande-bharat-mission-fliers/story-wMSxnFz4G3Q6FAFzQmxAEI.html

15-05-2020||Mumbai||Discharge of Covid-19 patients under ICMR’s policy can increase spread, claim experts||The relaxation in the discharge policy directed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) may not be suitable for the country’s most populated city, where 42% of its population dwells in slums, experts claimed. However, the state health department said that citizens should believe in administration’s dexterity. Recently, ICMR released a new discharge policy for Covid-19 patients, which stated that mild and pre-symptomatic patients will be discharged from Covid-19 centres if they do not develop fever in three days. HT reported on Thursday that with the ICMR’s new policy coming into effect, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) would have to release around 2,500 asymptomatic patients from the Covid Care Centres-2 (CCC-2). These patients are carriers of Sars-Cov-2 that causes novel coronavirus. The government’s previous rule stated that Covid patients can be released only if their swab test reports came negative twice in two consecutive tests. But as per the new rule released on May 9, very mild, mild and pre-symptomatic patients will be discharged without any test. An analysis of BMC data revealed that G North ward (Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim) has the highest number of asymptomatic patients at 529, followed by the G South ward (272), which is among the worst-affected wards with multiple containment zones and a large number of slum pockets. The 121 asymptomatic patients at CCC-2 facilities in M East wards (Govandi, Deonar and Chembur) will also be discharged. At a time when the state health department has confirmed signs of community spread in the state, the release of these patients can further increase the number of Covid cases, claimed experts. “Despite so many hassles, we conducted the contract tracing and isolated the asymptomatic patients from the slums so that they don’t spread the infection. But with the release of these patients, we will be back to square one,” said a civic official from G North ward which comprises of Dharavi — the biggest slum in Asia with a population of 8.5 lakh.Doctors also claimed that ICMR needs to be more rigid to the largest city in India due to its demographic differences. “The new policy states that mild patients can be discharged after 10 days of the onset of the symptoms. But in several cases, we have seen that patients remain positive even on the 25th day. Premature discharge will further spread the infection among people living in small-sized households,” said Dr Vijay Natarajan, chief executive officer, Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre.Data procured by HT shows that there are also several discrepancies in the screening of high-risk contacts of Covid patients from the most-infected wards. Wards such as G North and South, D and F North, which recorded the maximum number of coronavirus cases have quarantined one of the lowest number of high-risk patients in CCC-1 (type 1 Covid care Centres) facilities, which highlights that a large vulnerable group of people are yet to be identified and isolated as high-risk patients.“Areas such as Govandi, Bandra (East) and Dadar have a large number of tuberculosis (TB) patients. If Covid patients get discharged without getting cured, those with compromised lungs can contract the infections,” said Dr Ravikant Singh, a health activist from Doctors For You.“Hospitals are running on limited resources and the rules are being changed keeping mind that if the number goes up further as predicted by the Health Ministry. But we also need to understand that policies need to be formulated on scientific evidence not on administrative requirements,” said Anant Bhan, a global health expert. “We need to keep a check if the discharged person actually turned negative through tests,” he added.The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States also revised its guidelines on May 6 and stated that no negative test for the virus if required for discharge. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer said that depending on the impact and demographic spread of the virus, all the affected countries changed their policies, including China and Italy. He urged people to believe in experts from ICMR who have years of experience in the field and run several research before making policy changes. “When we say that a person is positive, it doesn’t mean he is still a spreader. He is just a carrier. Studies have shown that after ten days of the disease onset, the virus may not be infectious,” said Dr Awate. “Also, asymptomatic patients are not active carriers. They don’t sneeze or cough so the chance of infection spread is extremely limited,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/discharge-of-covid-19-patients-under-icmr-s-policy-can-increase-spread-claim-experts/story-z6Pxv1q0dZ0wjKkGu51aFM.html
15-05-2020||City||Maharashtra government wants to extend lockdown, waiting for Centre’s plan||The state government is in favour of extension of the ongoing lockdown till the end of the month. However, the government, during the meeting of the senior ministers and officials on Thursday, decided to wait till Sunday for the Centre to clarify its plan before making an announcement.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, his deputy Ajit Pawar and other senior ministers from the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government met at the bungalow reserved for Bal Thackeray memorial at Dadar to decide the course of action.The state leadership was unanimous over the extension of the lockdown with some more relaxations for industrial and commercial activities. The government is also in favour of allowing a few activities in red zones, by imposing stricter norms on containment zones.The meeting was convened to finalise the state’s official stand on the lockdown and its exit plan from it before conveying it to the Centre. “The CM has already spoken to district and divisional collectors. The government expects the Centre to relax some restrictions even in red zones,” said an official from the government. According to officials, while the Centre is expected to ease the restrictions for industrial and commercial activities, even in urban areas, the government has the power to continue with the stricter norms. “We are not in favour of allowing inter-district activities even in green and orange zones. There could be more relaxation in movements and industrial-commercial activities in these zones. We intend to introduce a few more activities in red zones too, by tightening the restrictions in containment zones. With the help of the central security forces, the zones will be sealed like ‘military curfew’, so that relaxations outside them are implemented with discipline,” another official said.Besides the CM and DCM, public works minister Ashok Chavan, revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, public undertakings minister Eknath Shinde, water resources minister Jayant Patil and senior officials attended the meeting.The ministers also emphasised on the need to ensure that packages announced by the Central government be implemented in the state properly. They also discussed the measures to be taken for revival of the state economy. An expert committee of bureaucrats, including retired IAS officers, has said that industrial sector and other activities must be opened across non-containment zones. The committee has also recommended emphasis on Mumbai by launching a special project to re-start the state economy and also suggested a special programme to support vulnerable groups namely street vendors, drivers and self-employed service providers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-government-wants-to-extend-lockdown-waiting-for-centre-s-plan/story-LWf5xnkBqe1HE3PDPgzxlM.html

15-05-2020||City||What hit HP in fight against Covid-19||SHIMLA/DHARAMSHALA At the beginning of May, Himachal Pradesh was inching closer towards becoming a coronavirus-free state with only one active case.The state seemed to have ticked all the right boxes and contained the spread of Covid-19. May 5 was the cut-off date as the state had not recorded a fresh case since April 23. The government was ready to make an announcement to this effect.However, a day before May5, the hill-state recorded a fresh case in Joginderngar of Mandi district. Next day, a youth from Sarkaghat died of the contagion. In less than two weeks, the state recorded 30 cases. The total positive cases in HP soared to 74, including two deaths. So, what went wrong ?MISTAKE OF OPENING THE BORDERSThe biggest mistake that the Himachal authorities committed was to open the borders of the state on April 26 to facilitate the return of those stranded in the other states.Thousands of people thronged the state-borders, chocking the inter-state barriers and throwing social distancing norms to the wind.The arrangements made by the bordering districts to screen the returnees were not enough and many entered unchecked.More than 50,000 people entered the state in less than a week, prompting the authorities to close its borders again.Things got spiral out of control as the government committed another mistake by sending the returnees direct to their homes, instead of placing them under institutional quarantine.So, why the government was forced to open the borders? The people, who were abiding by the government’s request of ‘stay put where you are’ started raising questions when two MP’s were allowed to quietly enter the state.Further, the government’s April 23 decision of bringing back stranded students from Kota, Rajasthan, added fuel to the fire, as others began to ask, “Why only they, what about us?”THE BIG SPIKESince May 4, the state has recorded 30 cases, including one fatality. Seventy per cent of the cases had travel history to other states, mostly Delhi-NCR and rest were their contacts. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur admitted that the number of cases have gone up after the people started returning to the state. “Over one lakh people have already entered the state and 55,000 more have applied for e-passes,” he had said in a press meeting two-day ago. He, however, also said that the state government could not have left its people stranded in the other states to fend for themselves.LACK OF RESOURCESThe state is still struggling to get rapid testing kits, while there is also a dearth of PPE kits and masks. Against its demand of 30,000 rapid testing kits from the Centre, Himachal only got 4,800 kits and these were too returned for being faulty. The state also lacks an adequate number of ventilators. Currently, there are only 60 ventilators in the health institutions across the state.STRENGTHENING THE QUARANTINEAfter much damage was done, chief minister announced to is make quarantine mechanism more stringent. Those returning from other states, especially red zones and those with influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms, are being quarantined in institutional facilities.Home quarantine has also been made stricter. Harsher penalties are being imposed for jumping quarantine.“Each and every person entering the state has to undergo thorough medical examination, then only it should be decided whether the person has to be kept under institutional quarantine or home quarantine,” Jai Ram had directed the district officials through video conferencing two-days ago. The state is also considering to create paid quarantine facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/what-hit-hp-in-fight-against-covid-19/story-6tMrFnY66UqtpQATKesqaP.html

Last night the army, police and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) had launched a joint operation after receiving an input about presence of militants at Yumrach village in the district, a police official said. He said the search operation turned into an encounter after the militants shot at the search party indiscriminately . “The troops immediately took cover and retaliated, however, the militants managed to escape taking the cover of darkness. A case has been registered and investigation is underway,” a police statement said.The police said searches were still under progress in the area to track down the militants.Last week, J&K police had got a big breakthrough in South Kashmir after operational commander of Hizbul Mujahideen, Riyaz Naikoo, was killed in an encounter at his native village, Gulzarpora Beighpora. He was killed along with his associate, a militant from Pulwama. Since the lockdown was announced in Kashmir on March 21, as many as 33 militants and their two associates were killed in 15 gunfights in different parts of Kashmir. Most of the encounters took place in four districts of South Kashmir- -Pulwama, Shopian, Kulgam and Anantnag. 20 security personnel had lost their lives in 18 in gunfights and two army men were killed in ceasefire violation on the Line of Control. Director general of police Dilbagh Singh had recently attributed the surge in attacks to fresh infiltration reported from north Kashmir’s Uri and Kupwara sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/encounter-breaks-out-in-kulgam-militants-manage-to-flee/story-a3pXBi3ZtRsXzJ4h4QFTAJ.html

15-05-2020||Mumbai||HC directs MoEFCC interim panel to decide on vehicular access to Matheran ESZ during lockdown||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday directed an interim monitoring committee appointed by the Ministry of Environment and Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) to decide on a plea by former Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA Suresh Lad seeking to temporarily lift the Ecologically Sensitive Zone (ESZ) status of Matheran in a bid to enable small vehicles to bring in essential commodities for the 4,500 residents of the hill station. The committee has been asked to take a decision by May 15 while petitioners have been asked to raise objections, if any, against the decision by May 16. A single bench of justice SJ Kathawalla, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL), was informed by advocate Gaurav Parkar that Matheran depends on tourism to earn a living, but since the lockdown was imposed the business has stopped. It was further informed that hand cart pullers and horse carts used to carry goods to the town were not available, and urged the court to allow small vehicles to visit the town with essential commodities.The state said that after 2003 when Matheran was declared an ESZ, MoEFCC was directed to form a monitoring committee, with a two-year tenure each, to oversee the needs of the residents vis-à-vis ecological impact of vehicular activities. However, even as the tenure of the last committee ended, no new committee was formed. The state asked that MoEFCC should be asked take a decision on the same as the state does not have an authority to decide on the issue.On Thursday, additional solicitor general Anil Singh submitted an affidavit filed by Lalit Bokolia, director in the MoEFCC, which stated that an interim committee has been formed under the chairmanship of Konkan Divisional Commissioner on May 13 which would decide on the application of the petitioner. The affidavit further stated the committee would have a tenure of six months and that a full-fledged committee would be formed in three months.After perusing the affidavit, justice Kathawalla observed, “While the decision to restrict vehicles in Matheran was taken in 2003 in the spirit of protecting ecological balance of Matheran ESZ, one cannot lose sight of the fact that in the current situation, it is also extremely essential to balance an individual’s right to procure with ease basic essentials and food supplies required to sustain life, which is at the very core of Article 21 of the Constitution.”He further observed, “A via media needs to be arrived at, whereby a vehicle is allowed to reach the core area of Matheran with essential supplies/goods on a regular basis and at the same time also ensure that such vehicles follow pollution norms so as to protect the ESZ of Matheran.”The petition has been placed for further hearing on May 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-directs-moefcc-interim-panel-to-decide-on-vehicular-access-to-matheran-esz-during-lockdown/story-fqixVNtK5o4VtXHQrm849I.html

The complaint was lodged against the portal with the cybercrime police station at Bandra-Kurla Complex in Mumbai.The article claimed that the Governor recommended and facilitated travel of a model from Uttarakhand, who was stuck in Maharashtra due to lockdown. She was allegedly first sent to Delhi in an Army helicopter and then taken to her home at Dehradun in an Army vehicle between April 24 and 25.“The contents of the news are false, fabricated and based on nefarious design with an intent to malign the unblemished image of Hon’ble Governor,” states the statement released by Raj Bhavan.“Actually, no such recommendation was given by Raj Bhavan, Mumbai in the matter,” said a BKC cyber police officer. A non-cognisable complaint has been registered under sections 500, 501 of the Indian Penal Code for defamation. “We shall be seeking permission from the court for investigating the matter,” the officer added.Maha bicycle mayors write to CM In a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, five bicycle mayors from the state (Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Pune and Nagpur) have stressed on prioritising use of bicycles during and after the lockdown.

15-05-2020||Mumbai||State sees highest spike in cases for 2nd day in a row||For a second consecutive day, Maharashtra reported its highest 24-hour spike in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases with 1,602 new infections on Thursday, taking its tally to 27,524. On Wednesday, the state had reported 1,495 cases. Of Thursday’s infections, 20,441 are active cases, said state health officials. However, officials, said there is no exponential growth and that the state has also not reached the stage of community transmission — where the source of infection is not known.Mumbai also recorded its highest one-day jump with 991 cases, taking its count to 16,738. The state’s toll breached the 1,000 mark after 44 deaths were recorded on Thursday, bringing the number to 1,019. Of them, 25 are in Mumbai, 10 in Navi Mumbai, five in Pune, two in Aurangabad and one each in Panvel and Kalyan. Of the 44 deceased, 34 were patients with comorbid conditions, said health officials. The death toll of Mumbai is 621.As the Centre is planning more relaxations post May 17, when the third phase of the lockdown ends, the number of fresh cases is rising rapidly in Maharashtra. Since more than a week (from May 6), the state is getting over 1,000 cases daily and by May 17, it is likely to breach the 30,000 mark. In May (last 14 days) alone, the state has reported as many as 17,026 cases. The first case was reported on March 9.The number of fresh cases has increased significantly this month, considering the average was around 500 new cases daily till April-end, which turned into four digits since May 6.The daily cases in the past eight days are as follows — May 6: 1,233; May 7: 1,216; May 8: 1,089; May 9: 1,165; May 10: 1,278; May 11: 1,230; May 12: 1,026 and May 13: 1,495. Besides, on May 10, the state also declared an additional 665 cases respectively, saying that they were registered in the past few days and are being declared as per the Central government’s directive to bring the data at par with the national figures on ICMR’s website. Between April 19 and 30, the state was getting around 500 new cases daily.In the past fourteen days since May 1, the state has reported as many as 17,026 cases, whereas the total number of cases registered in April was 10,201.Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER,) said, “The numbers are rising, but it cannot be called as exponential growth as in that case, the numbers multiply for daily cases. If the number of fresh cases becomes double on a daily basis, only then it can be called exponential growth.”“The state has also not reached the community transmission stage as it comes with exponential growth only,” he added.Meanwhile, the number of recoveries jumped to 6,059 with 512 more patients recovering on Thursday.Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, health department, said that the doubling rate of cases has improved to 11.1 days from 10 days. The state government has decided to take the rate to 20 days in the days to come, said the health minister Rajesh Tope.

On Thursday, the state also completed 52 days of lockdown, which was imposed from the midnight of March 23, a day before the nationwide lockdown imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was partially lifted on April 20 in areas where there are no cases or they are minimal in number.On Monday, the health department also declared it had conducted 2,40,145 tests at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra.

15-05-2020||Mumbai||Expert panel defers Mumbai’s marina plan||The Mumbai Port Trust’s (MbPT) plans for a ₹364.84-crore marina at Prince’s Dock has been deferred by an expert panel of the Central government. In a meeting held via video-conferencing on April 28, environment ministry’s Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) has raised concerns over the impact of the reclamation for migratory birds and roosting sites.EAC has also stated that ‘project proponent’ needs to be ‘mindful’ of the possible increase in traffic volume owing to the recreational facility and asked for detailed designs of the marina with ‘impact during floods/storm surges’.With a decline in port activities, MbPT has envisaged a major urban overhaul of the eastern waterfront stretching from Wadala to Colaba in the city. As part of the plan, the port trust proposed a marina with a capacity for 300 yachts on an 8.02-hectare land at Prince’s Dock in south Mumbai. The project falls under Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ)-II, CRZ-1 (B) and CRZ-IV as per approved Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) 2011, the committee notes.The Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) had recommended the proposal for clearance in December 2019. Sanjay Bhatia, chairman, MbPT, said, “They (EAC) have raised some queries. We will reply to that.” MbPT had earlier received CRZ clearance for undertaking reclamation for an Offshore Container Terminal (OCT) in 2006. While reclamation was undertaken in 2015-16, few pockets were left un-reclaimed, and the project was shelved. The new marina project has been proposed by “re-storing water bodies by re-excavation of existing part basin”, the committee notes.It states, “However, the committee also desired to know the impact of such reclamation on near shore areas for migratory birds and roosting sites, if any, with focus on whether such reclamation and subsequent impact (both positive and negative) on migratory birds will affect Navi Mumbai International Airport air safety.”In its letter to MbPT in 2019, Mumbai-based Urban Design Research Institute (UDRI) had objected to the development of a marina in the area saying that it is “a high-capital project that will exclusively cater to a select few privileged owners of yachts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/expert-panel-defers-mumbai-s-marina-plan/story-Z5RgjZoQYmeqC8amBqY7FP.html

The UPSRTC is providing buses at concessional rates in all 75 districts. The buses will be available at 115 bus stops in these districts for ferrying the workers, he said. “The government has also issued a GO in this regard. It seems industrialists are not aware of the arrangement made by us for providing mobility to workers,” said Rajesh Kumar Singh.In a bid to kick-start the industrial activities in the state, the centre has permitted the industries not only in orange and green zones but also in red zones, in all notified industrial areas across the state.District authorities at most of the places played the role of facilitator and permitted industrial activities in their respective regions. But due to the shortage of public transport labourers could not reach their units.Industrial activity across the state came to standstill from March 25, the day centre-imposed lockdown across the country to check the spread of coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/upsrtc-starts-bus-service-for-ferrying-workers/story-L6nCCgaPClpCiL8TWN52oL.html

Change in shop timings was also possible, it was learnt.Saying it was the “administration’s call” to allow shops with odd and even numbers to open on alternate days, sources said the Centre had allowed opening of all shops in the inner sectors for 12 hours straight in its phase 3 lockdown guidelines. “In the upcoming lockdown phase the union territory is contemplating opening of all shops in internal markets as the Centre too is focusing on the welfare of small traders,” said sources familiar with the matter. UT authorities, however, remained non-committal about other relaxations, even as traders in the city demanded opening of the marketing hub of Sector 17 and other prominent shopping zones such as Sector 22; including malls. Allowing cab services and public transport was also on the residents’ wish list, especially when such restrictions were being relaxed in neighbouring states and private and government offices being opened gradually in the city. WAIT FOR CENTRAL GUIDELINES: PARIDAWhen contacted, UT adviser Manoj Parida said he was unable to comment on the nature of relaxations in the next lockdown phase in the city till the Central guidelines were announced. Chandigarh was a Centrally administered territory unlike states which could take their own decisions. “So we will have to wait for the relaxations the Centre provides in its new guidelines and accordingly it will be reviewed at the level of the UT administrator for a final decision,” said Parida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/odd-even-restrictions-might-be-lifted-for-shops-in-chandigarh-s-neighbourhood-markets/story-NligziHI09SF2ec0lxRZVJ.html

15-05-2020||City||Mohali spends ₹1.33 crore to sent migrant workers back home||Mohali district has run up a tab of Rs 1.33 crore to ferry migrant workers back home to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar due to the Covid-19 lockdown even as 15,000 workers and their families were sent back in a week, deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said on Thursday.There was also a 30% drop in the number of migrants wanting to go back home as industries opened and farming jobs were renewed because of paddy transplantation.On the budget for a train journey, Dayalan said running a Shramik Special cost Rs 9 lakh, tickets amounted to Rs 7.5 lakh, 60 buses to transport labourers to the railway station meant an additional Rs 1.25 lakh. Water and refreshments for the journey cost Rs 30,000.Eight trains had left Mohali for various destinations of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (UP) in a week.Six more trains were proposed for both the states, Dayalan said, adding that the money was being spent from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and funding of Rs 2.18 crore allocated by the Punjab government for Mohali out of Rs 53.43 crore for all districts in the state to tackle the Covid-19 crisis.TRAINS SENT WHERE MAJORITY WANTED TO GOOn how the administration started sending back the workers from May 7, with eight trains leaving Mohali up to May 14, taking migrants to UP, Bihar and Jharkhand, Dayalan said data was compiled, statistics worked out and district wise departure schedule planned for the entire population of outbound migrants. First, districts where a large chunk of workers belonged to, such as Hardoi in UP, were targeted and then others were sent to multiple adjacent destinations in special trains.Six more trains are also proposed on May 15, 16 and 18.30% DROP IN NUMBERS OF WORKERS WANTING TO GO BACKDayalan also said that about 30% migrant workers registering with administration to go home had decided not to do so with easing of lockdown restrictions in labour-intensive industrial and construction sectors coupled with work opportunities in the paddy transplantation period.However, the administration was “geared up to help others wanting to return. In fact, we are also going to extend boarding facility from Mohali to the migrants from Ropar and Nawanshahar seeking to go back to districts listed by the Mohali administration,” he said.Those wanting to go to destinations not in the current schedule of the administration would be sent in trains headed there from neighbouring districts.BUSES GOING TO MANIPUR, ANDHRADayalan also said 225 workers were sent from Sirhind in buses towards Manipur and Andhra Pradesh while 900 would leave for Madhya Pradesh on Friday. People seeking to go back on private vehicles were also being issued permission after due screening.Health checks of the workers, once at the collection centre and then at the railway station were being done. Bus transportation (to the station) was provided free of cost and food, water and biscuits were provided by the administration.All vehicles had departed exactly at the scheduled time.The eighth special train which left Mohali Railway Station for Bihar on Thursday carried 1,501 migrant workers back to their home state with stoppages at Katihar, Patna, Champaran and Barauni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-spends-1-33-crore-to-sent-migrant-workers-back-home/story-1tarbPrVC1MOu8UM8tvSgO.html

His family members, including two children, who were walking a few metres behind him survived the collision.According to the police, the victim, Vipin Singh, worked as a daily wager at a private company in Udyog Vihar Phase 1. The firm was shut since the nationwide lockdown was imposed in March, and Vipin was left out of work, said victims’ younger brother, Pushpendra Singh, in the police complaint.Pushpendra, 32, said, “My brother was walking at least 20 steps ahead of us. We had started our journey around 12.30am, and were ascending the Jharsa flyover when a speeding canter truck hit my brother from behind. After the collision, the canter truck lost balance and rammed into another truck. The truck driver did not stop, while the driver of the canter truck abandoned his vehicle and escaped on foot.” A case has been registered against the canter driver.The police said the victim sustained severe injuries and was rushed to the Sector 10 civil hospital by the highway patrol team. A police officer privy to the investigation in the matter, requesting anonymity, said, “The incident took place around 1.30am. The victim succumbed to his injuries during treatment. The canter, which had a Delhi registration number, has been seized and we are trying to trace the suspect.”Police officers said the victim was accompanied by his wife, children, and his brother’s family. At least ten people, including the victim, were among those walking together to their village Shiv Singh Purwa. In the police complaint, Pushpendra said, “My brother and I had moved to Gurugram several years ago in search of work, and had been staying on rent in Sirhaul village. I worked in a garment firm in Udyog Vihar. After the lockdown, we had been out of work and decided to return to our village for a better living. So, we all decided to walk to Sitapur and had only walked for a bit when the incident took place.”The victim’s body was handed over to the family after an autopsy on Wednesday, following which the family returned to UP in an ambulance, the police said.A case was registered against the driver of the canter truck under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 304A (death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code at Sector 40 police station on Wednesday, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/migrant-worker-walking-back-home-with-family-run-over-by-truck-on-jharsa-flyover/story-NjV7k4MxIiwnhQioSkY6FP.html
15-05-2020||Gurugram||Farrukhnagar keeps Covid at bay through restrictions and social distancing||Farrukhnagar, one of the four blocks in the Gurugram district, has managed to keep coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases at bay since the beginning of the outbreak. Surrounded by Covid-19-affected areas from all sides, the block has not reported a single case till now. Health department officials say they have collected more than 200 samples in the block after contact tracing and random sampling, while municipal and police officers say they have managed to restrict interdistrict and interstate movements. The Gurugram district is made up of four blocks, namely Gurugram, Pataudi, Sohna and Farukkhnagar. The two blocks, Gurugram and Pataudi, are adjoining Farukkhnagar. While Gurugram city has reported 160 Covid-19 cases, Pataudi has seven cases till now. Other bordering districts, such as Jhajjar has 87 cases, while Rewari has six cases.“We have been vigilant even before the lockdown was announced,” said Dr Aruna Sangwan, senior medical officer, Farrukhnagar. “We have conducted testing of more than 200 people after contact tracing and random sampling. Compared to Gurugram, the population in Farruknagar is less and most people live in the rural areas,” said Sangwan. The block has a population of over 66,000 people, with 24,000 residing in urban areas and the remaining 42,000 in 26 villages. Recently, there were cases of infected people visiting the block A lab technician, who worked at Sohna and lived in Farrukhnagar, tested positive for Covid-19. According to the health team, all his immediate contacts tested negative. Sangwan and her team has been coordinating with the urban local body(ULB) and the village committees since the beginning when cases were reported in Gurugram city. “We continue to hold meetings with village committees, asking them to restrict movement. Many of them used to visit Delhi and Jhajjar to supply milk. We asked them to restrict their movement. It is now controlled as people are aware. But we keep on conducting random sampling,” said Dr Sangwan. The health team has been running mobile OPDs in Haryana Roadways buses to reach out to people in villages. Dr Rajpal Nain of the mobile team, said, “It is the harvest season due to which farmers experience allergies or flu-like symptoms. During our visit, we find people inquiring about these symptoms. They often think it is Covid-19. We explain them about the disease and, if necessary, take their sample.” Restricting movement KK Yadav, secretary (administrative head), municipal committee, Farrukhnagar, said, “Throughout the lockdown the municipality has put its own barricading at the vulnerable points, such as the roads connecting different districts or blocks. Even the roads to the congested parts of the city has been barricaded allowing only two-wheelers and pedestrians.” He said that after the relaxation in the lockdown after May 3, they have been taking extra precautions. “Barber shops and salons have been asked to maintain a record of their customers that is being checked by municipal employees,” said Yadav adding that they have been doing regular review meeting and flag marches in urban areas. His team of 35 people have been doing sanitisation in cowsheds and temples.Procurement in rural areasIn the rural areas, on the other hand, procurement of wheat and mustard is underway. For the first time, the Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board (HSAMB) had set up five separate mandis(markets) for the procurement of wheat. Apart from the main Farrukhnagar market, where mustard procurement is taking place, small mandis have been set up in schools, stadiums and community centres.“It is for the first time, these small mandis at almost 7 kilometres distance from the main mandi, have been set up to procure wheat from the farmers. Each mandi allows only 50 farmers to drop their produce. Only 10 farmers are allowed at a time in order to maintain social distancing,” said Mohan Jowel, executive officer, HSAMB, Farrukhnagar. According to Jowel, police personnel help in ensuring that the rules are not violated. “Police and our teams explained farmers about using masks and maintaining social distancing. There are some elements in villages who are not willing to understand the situation. The police helped us in dealing with those people,” he said. Strict actionAccording to Savit Kumar, station house officer(SHO), Farrukhnagar, FIR has been lodged against at least 20 people for crossing the borders or for opening shops. “We have been following the district administration guidelines, allowing movement from 7am to 7pm. But on crucial borders, we are not allowing people without movement passes. Five police teams have been deployed to check the registers maintained at the nakas (check posts), recording the in and out movement of people,” said Kumar. Theekri Pehr, a kind of patrolling done by villagers, was initially carried out in all the villages. “Now, it has been discontinued after meeting with the village heads. They are being done only in the villages on the border areas,” said Kumar. With the ease in restriction, officials are now worried of the spread of infection. According to them, they are only creating awareness regarding social distancing and using masks, asking people to restrict interdistrict movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farrukhnagar-keeps-covid-at-bay-through-restrictions-and-social-distancing/story-X6WvksUkHNHPfGA6dwpt8N.html

15-05-2020||Noida||Meagre meals and no ration force migrant workers to beg for food||Nirmala Devi, a migrant worker who lives in a jhuggi in Sector 43, Noida, holds on to her toddler as she turns her hopeful eyes towards people walking away from the counter of a Sector 41 liquor store. She feels uncomfortable stretching her hand out to them, but the biting reality of hunger and the toddler hanging onto her make her beg. Nirmala Devi, a daily wager, who along with her husband, a construction worker, hails from a village in Patna has had no earnings since the lockdown was announced on March 24; she also has no ration card and the meals supplied by the community kitchen are insufficient for her and her family. Begging, she says, is the only option left. “I could somehow manage with the meals from the community kitchen, but not my child. She cries at night, hungry for milk that we have no money to buy. For the past few weeks, I am surviving on the mercy of others. People give us money; some buy me food or milk. I never imagined that I will have to stand and beg in this city,” she says.“The meals from the community kitchen are often irregular -- sometimes the distributors don’t bring the food or it is not enough for everyone. We did try to walk back home to Patna, but the police caught us from near Sector 50 and sent us back,” she said.Meanwhile, a man buys two packets of milk and a biscuit pack from a neighbouring store and hand them to her. She humbly accepts them with folded hands, keeps the milk in a sack and gives the biscuits to her daughter.Asked if she owns an Aadhaar card, Jan Dhan account or a ration card, she said, “I received no money in my Jan Dhan account and despite giving our name for a ration card, we have neither received the card nor the ration. The last ration I received was in March -- about half a kilo of dal, five kilos of rice and atta, potatoes, oil and a few packets of spices,” Nirmala Devi said.There are many like her across the city. A number of migrants are forced to beg for food, and are living on the mercy of people out shopping for rations and other items.Nine-year old Muskaan and her six-year-old sister were among those looking to the goodness of others to survive. Standing in front of a super store in Sector 76, all Muskaan and her sister beg from high-rise dwellers of sectors 77 and 76 is little bit of rice or flour or some milk. Her family migrated from West Bengal to Noida and were working as daily wagers, but that stopped when the lockdown was clamped.“Our mother goes to get meals from the Bhangel community kitchen, and we come here to get whatever help we can get,” Muskaan said.Ram Swaroop, another migrant from Bihar who lives in the slums of Sector 16, said, “The last earning I got was ₹450, a day before Holi (March 9), when a contractor took me and a few others to clean a vacant plot of bushes and garbage. There had been no work since then. The food van comes here, but sometimes they stop, sometimes they don’t. I have family to feed, what option do I have other than begging?”Despite the tall claims of the district administration, ration and community kitchen meals are still not reaching those that need them the most. But officials insist that it is reaching the poor.“There has been no changes in the meals we are supplying since Day One of lockdown. We try to reach as many people as we can. When we get calls from people that food is not being delivered in their areas, we direct the distribution teams to ensure that they cover those areas as well,” Vir Singh, tehsildar and in-charge of city’s largest community kitchen at Mamura, said. The kitchen dispatches meals to over 17,000 people daily.While there are no official number available as to how many poor migrants live in the city, a rough estimation puts their number at 1 lakh -- based on the number of meals being distributed through the community kitchens. Around one lakh to 1,00,436 meals are distributed through 16 community kitchens, officials said.Stating that meals are served twice a day – without exceptions—Singh said the main aim is to ensure that the supplies don’t run out.“It’s wrong to say that meal deliveries are sometimes skipped. One day we ran out of rice, so before it could reach us through official channels, I put in ₹50,000 from my pocket and sent the workers to buy the rice to ensure that meals are not skipped,” he said.Officials attribute faulty deliveries to the difficulties of serving a large population.“There could be some exceptions and maybe, on occasion, people missed their meals, but we ensure that the meals dispatched from community kitchen reach everyone. Social workers, too, help us ensure that food reaches everyone,” Rajiv Mohan Saxena, who heads the Harola community kitchen, said. It distributes food to over 14,000 people daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/meagre-meals-and-no-ration-force-migrant-workers-to-beg-for-food/story-yhw5o4x5Y8p1slmp1Wd0sI.html

15-05-2020||Delhi||Biggest single-day spike as Delhi Covid-19 cases cross 8,000||New Delhi: Delhi saw its highest single-day spike in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases so far, with 472 recorded on Thursday. The surge takes the city’s Covid-19 tally to 8,470, according to Delhi’s daily health bulletin. Before this, the highest number of cases recorded in a single day was 448, on May 7.Delhi breached the highest single-day spike in case numbers for the fourth time in May on Thursday. From just over 3,500 Covid-19 cases recorded till April-end, the numbers have shot up with nearly 4,500 cases being recorded in the city in just 14 days.With lockdown curbs being relaxed after May 3 , when its second phase ended, and further easing expected after May 17, experts said they expected the number of cases to rise even further.“The numbers will go up as more people move about. Even the lockdown has not been very effective in curtailing the spread of the infection in congested areas. If you see the slums or redevelopment colonies, there are several people living in one room. They will step out in the summers. The chance of spread owing to the use of community toilets is very high as well,” the official added.Health care workers and patients going to hospitals continue to be another group at a higher risk of infection. “There are several health care workers and patients and their families who have visited the hospitals who are testing positive. This is still a major concern in the city,” said another district official on condition of anonymity.At least 500 health care workers in Delhi have tested positive for Covid-19 so far.Nine deaths recordedNine more deaths have been added to Delhi’s cumulative Covid-19 toll, taking the total to 115, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government. However, none of these were recorded in the last 24 hours, according to the report.The revised toll still puts the city’s mortality rate at 1.3%.A three-member death audit committee has been reviewing case sheets and death summaries, and adding the numbers to the daily report.A discrepancy in the number of deaths recorded in the daily bulletin and those reported from individual hospitals was highlighted last week, after which the government instituted new standard operating procedures (SoP) for dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, asking them to report their deaths by 5pm each day or face action.The government has also removed a hospital-wise break-up of deaths from its bulletin. “The committee is working on clearing the backlog of cases within this week, after which there shouldn’t be an unusual spike in the number of deaths. The new SoP has certainly helped in speeding up the process,” said a senior official from the Delhi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/biggest-single-day-spike-as-delhi-covid-cases-cross-8-000/story-5db5akpH7KnZIoZChnBdXL.html
15-05-2020||Delhi||HC tells Delhi govt to take call on online sale, home delivery of liquor by May 15||The Delhi High Court has asked the Delhi government to decide on the online sale and home delivery of liquor in the national capital by May 15. The Delhi government assured the court that it would decide by the mandated date.A bench of justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal was hearing a plea by a 21-year-old law student, Aadhaar Gaur, who had sought a ban on the sale of liquor in the city. He had challenged the May 3 notification of the Delhi government, which had permitted the sale of liquor.On Wednesday, during the hearing, the Centre informed the bench that several states had started the online sale of alcohol. Gaur submitted that the petition was not maintainable and that a similar matter had been dismissed by the Supreme Court of India.The Delhi government’s counsel submitted that the sale of liquor was a matter of public policy and it was for the state to make a decision. The court sought to know from him as to what decision had been taken pursuant to the May 11 order of the HC, where it had directed both the Centre and the Delhi government to decide on the online sale of delivery at the earliest.The Delhi government counsel assured the court that the decision by the government would definitely be taken on or before May 15.Following such submissions, the court refused to pass an order and said that all the contentions of the petitioner had already been heard and considered.“Having considered the contentions of the counsel for the petitioner, we do not find any need or case made out to take a different view than that taken in the order dated May 11. Though the counsel for the petitioner contends that the submissions as made by him today were not considered on May 11 but all the said factors were considered and debated during the hearing, though may not be recorded in the order since the Supreme Court had to make a decision; only constructive suggestions which could help the GNCTD in taking a decision were recorded in the order aforesaid.“This petition is also thus liable to be dismissed and is dismissed but binding the GNCTD to take a decision as assured,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-tells-delhi-govt-to-take-call-on-the-online-sale-and-home-delivery-of-liquor-by-may-15/story-jQgUO6fJaN23L7Io83zqxM.html
15-05-2020||Delhi||Essential service providers to be given smooth passage: Haryana to Delhi HC||The Haryana government has given an undertaking before the Delhi High Court that it would issue e-passes for inter state movement of all those engaged in providing essential services, including medical professionals within 30 minutes of receipt of application. Each e-pass shall be valid for the entire duration of the lockdown and could be used for multiple visits, the state government told the high court.The submission was made during the hearing of public interest litigation (PIL) by OP Gupta who had moved the court against blanket restriction on movement of people from Delhi to Sonepat were put in place to curb rising coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. Severe restrictions were also put in place at the Delhi-Gurugram border by the Haryana government after it claimed that several cases in Gurugram had their root in Delhi. The curbs on movement of people involved in essential services have now been eased. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicA bench of justices Manmohan and Sanjeev Narula said that essential service providers shall not be quarantined unless and until they test positive for Covid-19 or are found in contact with a patient. The bench told Haryana additional advocate general (AAG) Anil Grover that the state government was bound by the undertaking it had given to the court to allow the unhindered movement of essential service providers with e-passes.The state government had claimed that since about 56% of the coronavirus cases in the national capital region (NCR) districts — Gurugram, Faridabad, Jhajjar and Sonepat — had Delhi connections, it will allow back and forth movement of medical professionals from Delhi only on production of movement passes.Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayTaking up the PIL, the HC had on May 8 said that orders of the Sonepat district magistrate (DM) restraining the movement of doctors, nurses, court officials and trucks from Delhi to Sonepat constituted an infringement of the constitutional provisions. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) had on May 11 asked the states to ensure that interstate movement of medical professionals, nurses, paramedics should be facilitated. The directions came after the issue of restrictions being imposed by some states, including Haryana, was flagged during a meeting between the cabinet secretary and state governments last Sunday.Grover also told the court that the free movement of trucks carrying both essential as well as non-essential goods between Delhi and Haryana (except to and from containment zones) as well as transiting through Haryana shall be allowed.Also Read: Biggest single-day spike as Delhi Covid cases cross 8,000He assured the high court that the Delhi-Haryana border is open and the roads near the border have not been dug up, adding that the state border would be kept open.The petitioner had claimed that even doctors, nurses and court officials who either reside in Sonepat or work there are being prevented from entering or leaving the city.Following the submission by the Haryana government, the HC bench disposed of the plea. Dr Harish Gupta, member of the Delhi Medical Association (DMA)and National Medical council (NMC), said that the order was necessary because several doctors and nurses serving in Delhi live in Gurugram.“Many doctors, both in the government and private sector, were facing problems since their houses were in Gurugram. Around 100 doctors from the Safdarjund Hospital also reside in Gurugram and were finding it difficult to commute because of the restrictions.“So, it was very much required as you cannot stop healthcare workers from performing their duties,”he said.The Delhi government also welcomed the undertaking by its Haryana counterpart.“We are glad that the Haryana government has agreed to ensure the unhindered movement of essential staff, for which we were appealing from Day One. Stopping their movement was a violation of the Centre’s orders. This is the time to work together as a nation and fully support our Corona Warriors,” a Delhi government statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/essential-service-providers-to-be-given-smooth-passage-haryana-to-hc/story-f8ncSgH1xmMKSqgPLRMLSN.html

The 29-year-old prisoner was admitted for a surgery at the Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) hospital on Sunday. Doctors had tested him for the virus on Monday. Jail officers said that the hospital informed the prison department on Wednesday about the inmate’s test results. The prisoner has been shifted to the Covid-19 speciality Lok Nayak hospital. Prison officials said the inmate was asymptomatic and was brought to the prison in December last year in connection with a robbery case. Additional inspector general, Raj Kumar of Tihar prisons said, “19 prisoners in Rohini district jail, with whom he (29-year-old prisoner) was in contact during his prison stay have been tested. They did not show any symptoms but we have still isolated them as a precaution. The prisoner, who tested positive, is not a new prisoner. He was in prison for 4-5 months. Along with the 19 prisoners, some jails officials and a few doctors who had interacted with him have also been tested. The result is awaited.”This is the first case of a prisoner in Delhi testing positive for the coronavirus disease. Officials said that all superintendents of Tihar jail, which houses around 15,000 prisoners, is already on high alert. Rohini jail is a smaller complex compared to Tihar and houses around 2,500 prisoners. Tihar Jail officials are on high alert after reports of the disease spreading rapidly in Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail. In Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail where 4,000 prisoners are lodged, within a week of one prisoner contracting the virus, the infection had affected 184 prisoners and prison staff. It also prompted the Maharashtra to look at releasing half the prisoners in its jails to contain the spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rohini-jail-inmate-1st-prisoner-to-test-ve-in-delhi/story-tHD03MqTP1vryEW6rIhORN.html

Senior officers said officers deployed to screen passengers will be given a webcam each to record their boarding passes. The webcam recording will be synchronised with the CCTV camera footage of the security hold area (SHA) making it easy for the security personnel to track any passenger later if need be, the officers said.The new method has been adopted following one of the directions from the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) issued Wednesday, asking CISF, the force that secures the airport, to stop stamping the boarding passes as a measure to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know today“Our men who are stationed at the security check area, with a stamp, will now be given a webcam each. They’ll record every boarding pass. This is to ensure zero direct contact between passengers and our officers. The recordings will be collected as a database and can be used whenever required,” a senior officer from the airport, who wished not to be named, said.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe officer said that the new method shall cause no additional delay. “However, we are yet to get results. Stamping of boarding passes did not take time and we hope recording, which will only take a few seconds, will also not take much time,” the officer added.In one of its earlier orders, dated March 19, the BCAS had said, “It is learnt that one of the most common methods of transmission of Covid-19 seems to be through infected surfaces. It is, therefore, desirable to avoid touching surfaces that might be infected due to human touch.”Also Read: Rs 2L-crore concessional credit offer to 25 million farmersIn the same order issued Wednesday BCAS said passengers are being advised to use hand sanitiser frequently while travelling during the Covid-19 pandemic. After the orders were given, it was also decided to allow passengers to carry sanitiser up to a limit of 350ml in their handbag.Indira Gandhi International airport, like other airports in the country, is yet to start passenger flights. All domestic flights in the country were suspended March 25 onwards, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19.

An investigation has revealed that these goods were sourced from traders in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.According to senior customs officials, as per the guidelines of Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), these goods are, at present, prohibited for export because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.“Late Wednesday evening, following a tip-off, we checked an identified consignment scheduled to be sent to China and found 5.08 lakh (508,000) face masks packed in it. The packet had been misdeclared as plastic pouches. Following another tip, when we checked a series of parcels in the courier section of the Delhi airport’s cargo area, we found other parcels that had been declared as fabrics too. When opened, 950 bottles of sanitisers, containing 57 litres in all, and 952 PPE kits were recovered. These were scheduled to depart for the USA, UK and UAE,” said a senior customs official, who wished not to be named.The officer said further investigation is underway to track the source of these consignments. “Our information suggests that these items were sourced from traders and dealers in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-customs-halts-illegal-export-of-protective-gear-sanitisers/story-t7TONtrHn3qSg8HqewTSyO.html

We closed our office as soon as we came to know about the first case on Tuesday,” Gupta said.Around 10 officials of the market committee have been in direct contact with the two Covid-19 patients. “All are in home quarantine and their samples will be taken on Friday for testing,” he said.Ghazipur Mandi is the second-largest wholesale vegetable and fruit market in the city, after Azadpur. The Ghazipur wholesale market is spread over one square kilometre area and receives around 400 trucks a day. The wholesale market every day gets around 1,300 tonnes of vegetables and fruits supply. Ghazipur market caters to the fruit and vegetable supply to East Delhi markets as well to Noida and Ghaziabad markets.Ashok Kheda, a wholesale trader in Ghazipur market, said it was a “wise” decision to completely shut the market, otherwise the situation could turn worse.“Wholesale markets are vulnerable to the spread of coronavirus disease because of crowding. This is the first time that Covid-19 cases have been reported here. Closing the market for two days will surely have some impact on vegetable and fruit supplies in the eastern parts of the city but it is necessary for the greater good of the public,” he said.A senior district administration official, who wished not to be named, said the exercise of spraying of disinfectant in the market has begun and would be completed by Friday evening. “Contact tracing of the two patients is underway and testing of those who had come in contact with them will be conducted on Friday. I’m hopeful that the market will start functioning smoothly from Saturday,” the official said.This is not the first time that Covid-19 cases have been reported from Delhi’s wholesale markets.On April 24, a total of 300 shops were closed at Azadpur APMC, Asia’s biggest vegetable and fruit market, after the death of a trader who tested positive for Covid-19.

However, within hours, the two had to make other arrangements to leave after an argument broke out between the other occupants, reportedly angered by the admission of the transwomen, and shelter home employees.“We stayed there for a few hours and we were given some food and water. But when some residents started arguing with officials in the shelter home, we decided to leave. We did not want to cause any trouble and stay in a place where our own safety is at risk,” Preeti said. The duo is now housed with a non-governmental organization in the locality.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicSuch complaints of discrimination by occupants of shelter homes is not new, social activists working with the transgender community in the city said.Ever since the lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March to control the spread of the infectious Covid-19 disease, the sources of income of many members of the transgender community such as sex work, begging, and ‘mangti’ — a traditional occupation during weddings and other celebrations — have dried up.“The transgender community has been hit hard by the pandemic. Many are either sex workers or used to ask for money in traffic junctions and that has stopped now. We have received some complaints that the occupants of some shelter homes objected to sharing space with transgender persons,” said Sumukhi Deka, a Delhi-based activist.Deka said that Saransh, an organization she has co-founded, has accommodated three transgender women who faced trouble in a shelter home in east Delhi. They faced threats and were subjected to physical violence by other occupants due to which they left. Also Read: ‘Govt left migrants to mercy of God’: CongressLast week, a similar incident was reported from west Delhi’s Rohini, where a transgender woman was asked to vacate a shelter home by its residents. Though the officials intervened and attempted to resolve the matter, the transperson left the following morning and the shelter home is currently unaware of her whereabouts. Sunil Kumar Aledia, the national convener at National Forum for Homeless Housing Rights (NFHHR) said that aim of shelter homes is to ensure that occupants are safe and provided with a comfortable facility, however, unless there is awareness of issues pertaining to gender dysphoria, the stigmatization against transpersons will continue to pose problems for them.“We had rescued four transgender persons a few days ago from near the New Delhi railway station and after spending a night at the shelter home, the District Magistrate made alternative arrangements for them,” Aledia said. The four had tickets for Gujarat dated May 15. “Since that shelter home was only for men and we had no other option but to make some arrangement for the night, our volunteers stood at the gate all night to ensure that they were safe. The next morning we moved them to our office in south Delhi and they will board the train to Surat on Friday. There are no dedicated shelter facilities for transgender persons and we have raised this issue multiple times with the government,” Aledia said.A senior official of the district administration said that transgender persons are usually relocated with NGOs to ensure their safety.Also Read: Street vendors to get loans of up to Rs 10,000“We want to ensure that these people are safe. Many occupants in homeless facilities have a limited understanding [of issues pertaining to transgender communities]. To prevent any physical and sexual crime against transgender persons, it is important that they be moved to alternative facilities,” the official said.Rudrani Chettri, who spearheads trans rights group Mitr Trust said that the community is severely affected by the pandemic. “We have been distributing food packets and groceries to homeless transgender persons who have no means to earn for themselves now. But they are not receiving any benefit from the government. Many don’t have ration cards and government documents,” Chettri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/transpersons-in-delhi-shelter-homes-tackle-abuse-prejudice/story-nIZt1ZqMBgJue5EuxdisDI.html

The police, however, said the incident was reported on May 7, following which they had arrested a local resident.Ramniwas Solanki, the general secretary of the MCD Teachers’ Union, said that the crowd of around 500 became agitated after finding the gate of the school closed. Solanki claimed that the school was locked following a Delhi government order that said all schools turned into ration centres will remain shut on Thursday.Also Read: Indian Covid-19 vaccine development to be backed by PM-CARES“It was declared a ‘Closing Day’ on which no ration will be distributed and we (teachers) were required to take stock of how much ration has been received from godowns and how much of it had been distributed in the last one month and send reports to the Delhi government,” Solanki said.Around 1,000 Delhi government and corporation schools have been functioning as ‘Hunger Relief (food distribution) Centres’ and ‘Ration Centres’ since April to provide relief for people during the nationwide lockdown. More than 40,000 Delhi government teachers have been engaged on ration distribution duty. The hunger centres open at 8am and close by 6pm, daily.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicRice and wheat flour are part of a standard ration kit that are being distributed .“We had already put up boards outside the school gates announcing that no ration will be distributed on Thursday. However, the crowd that turned up in the morning wasn’t ready to go back empty-handed. First, the men abused us. They then started pelting stones and broke a classroom’s window. We had to hide some of our female colleagues and call the police for help,” said Bharat Lal Meena, principal of the Nagar Nigam Prathmik Bal Vidyalaya, Prem Nagar, Rohini Zone.Also Read: Delhi finalises lockdown 4.0 plansReacting to the incident, north corporation commissioner, Varsha Joshi, said, “We are writing to the Food Supply and Consumer Affairs (FCS) department of Delhi Government on the subject. The concerned deputy commissioners and additional directors of education (of the corporation) have regularly raked up the issues being faced by teachers on duty, but to no avail. These issues have been cropping up due to non-availability of a proper list or non-availability of ration.”“Our DCs and ADEs have been writing to concerned district magistrates regularly requesting for more police presence at these centres. Our additional commissioner (education) has also written to the secretary FCS today,” she said.A senior government official said, “The food and civil supplies department has taken cognizance of the matter and the issue will be resolved at the earliest. This month around 2.5 million individuals, who do not possess ration cards, have availed essentials under the special scheme. Ration is distributed to all centres from central storehouses in every district. The demand and supply across all centres is taken into account.”Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pramod Kumar Mishra, however, claimed that the incident was reported on May 7 but the video of stone pelting was circulated on social media on Thursday.“There was a local resident of Prem Nagar Phase III, Lal Kishan, who was forced to return home without ration for two days. On third day, after again not managing to get ration, he got agitated, picked up some stones from nearby railway tracks and started throwing them at the school building. Seeing him, some other agitated locals also joined in,” the DCP said.Mishra said that the police was informed by the locals and they arrested Kishan. “We dispersed the crowd and Kishan was put under preventive custody. He was released on bail the next day. There was no official complaint from any authority,” the DCP said.A similar incident had taken place on Monday in Tigri in a South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) school, where six female teachers were allegedly manhandled by a crowd of ration seekers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/crowd-pelts-shut-ration-centre-with-stones-tries-to-break-open-gate/story-JjSCMMtmHlJ5xRWqPmbIxI.html
15-05-2020||Noida||A day after furore, UP panel to review fares for travel to, from Delhi airport||The Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) on Thursday formed a three-member committee to review its chartered taxi and bus fare structures proposed to ferry commuters from the India Gandhi International Airport to Noida, Ghaziabad and other districts of Uttar Pradesh.The corporation’s managing director Raj Shekhar said the committee comprises senior officials from the department of operation, technical and regional transport authority. “They will look into the matter and submit recommendations in 24 hours. UPSRTC will introduce some changes in the fare structure,” he said.Several people had criticised UPSRTC, saying the exorbitant fare would burden those already suffering during the lockdown. On May 9, the state transport corporation had issued a letter to its regional managers in Noida and Ghaziabad stating that booking a sedan for up to 250km from the airport would cost Rs 10,000. Each additional kilometre would cost Rs 40. Booking an SUV would cost Rs 12,000 for first 250km and Rs 50 for each additional kilometre. Similarly, a single seat in a non air-conditioned bus would cost Rs 1,000 and a seat in an air-conditioned bus would cost Rs 1,320 for 100km. The charges would double for a distance between 101km and 200km.Since Noida and Ghaziabad share a border with the national Capital, paying such a huge fare was termed irrational by several residents, who also tweeted about the matter.The corporation’s managing director clarified that the services were not limited to just Noida and Ghaziabad. He said that people could book a cab for an entire day and travel to any district in UP. “People can book a taxi from the airport for an entire day and travel to different districts like Bareilly, Moradabad, Meerut, etc. The taxi drivers will bring empty vehicles and they can’t book or lift commuters on return. The commuters need not share the ride with others, unlike other taxi services,” he said.He said that at present, people from abroad are quarantined in Delhi. “We have engaged some buses to ferry them from the airport to hotels. We have not charged them until now,” he said.UPSRTC, in a press statement, said, “We received information from different sources that the UPSRTC’s proposed chartered taxi and bus fare is high. Taking cognisance of the matter, we formed a committee. We resolve to facilitate the safe journey of commuters.”The corporation is yet to start this chartered bus and taxi service from the airport as most people brought back to India via the Vande Bharat Mission are quarantined in Delhi.Shekhar added that UPSRTC is reviewing its order, especially pertaining to the Noida, Ghaziabad commute to and from Delhi. “We will introduce some changes in the fare structure once we receive the recommendation from the committee,” he said.UPSRTC runs over 10,000 buses, while it has a few taxis in each district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/upsrtc-forms-three-member-committee-to-review-taxi-bus-fare-structure-after-facing-criticism/story-qJ0Q4Wk4zhpIXmK2CyxwhO.html

It’s a big challenge for us, but we are equal to the task. As per the chief minister’s directive, we have to facilitate in the next seven days all those who want to come to the state either by trains or buses. We are planning more trains in the coming few days,” said Kumar.A total of 2.25 lakh migrant workers were staying at 4,671 block-level quarantine centres of Bihar to prevent them from going directly to their villages in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.Bihar had received 1.99 lakh migrant workers by 161 special trains amid lockdown 3.0, till May 13. Another 4 lakh migrants were scheduled to come by 267 additional trains.

The family of the retired special bureau official had to run from pillar to post for cremating his mortal remains.A senior doctor of Government Medical College and Hospital, Jammu, on the condition of anonymity, said, “After residents led by councillors of ward numbers 6 and 7 didn’t allow the deceased’s cremation at Jogi Gate crematorium on Wednesday night fearing that it would spread the infection in the area, the body was brought back to the mortuary of the hospital. On Thursday, it was taken to another facility in Shastri Nagar and finally cremated by the hospital staff in the presence of two family members of the deceased, including his son-in-law.”However, at Shastri Nagar crematorium also, the locals objected to the cremation, but the district officials and police intervened in time and the body was cremated under the supervision of a naib tehsildar, the senior doctor said.‘CREMATION DONE AFTER CHIEF SECRETARY’S INTERVENTION’Sources said it was only after chief secretary BVR Subrahmanyam’s intervention that the cremation of the former special bureau official took place.The son-in-law of the deceased said, “We still have not been given a medical report mentioning the cause of death of my father-in-law. I doubt he may have died of some other reason and not coronavirus.” “We had a harrowing time in cremating him. A septuagenarian, who served the special bureau and worked for the country, deserved a dignified cremation and for that matter, whosoever dies, has the right of a decent burial or cremation,” he said.‘HOSPITAL DENIED AMBULANCE AT FIRST’The deceased’s son-in-law also cornered the hospital, saying that they initially refused to provide them an ambulance and their staff for the cremation.The hospital authorities, however, rubbished the allegations. “The elderly was brought to the emergency on May 12 at 7:20pm. He was immediately examined by the doctor on duty and declared brought dead. Since his attendants suspected his death due to the coronavirus, on their insistence, the body was shifted to mini mortuary. His nasopharyngeal swab was taken for the virus and sent for testing on priority basis. The test was reported positive on Wednesday,” they said. The hospital management also claimed that they immediately provided an ambulance to the family for transporting the body to the cremation ground.Local Congress councillor from ward number 7, Ritu Choudhary, said, “Given the magnitude of the infection and ever increasing death count, the administration should identify a proper place for the cremation of those dying of coronavirus. Earlier, a 61-year-old woman from Udhampur, who also succumbed to the coronavirus, was also cremated at Jogi Gate. At that time, I had pacified my people telling them that it was a government decision.”“It’s a densely populated locality and people are afraid of infection,” she said. The BJP leader also appealed to the government to inform the elected councillors in advance before permitting the cremation of any coronavirus victim in their respective areas.It was the second death due to the coronavirus in Jammu region and 11th in Jammu and Kashmir.Meanwhile, repeated calls and messages to the Jammu district commissioner and senior police officers didn’t evoke any response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/locals-oppose-cremation-of-72-year-old-former-special-bureau-officer-who-died-of-coronavirus/story-uFDl8nFQ9GCgmLwyw68vHN.html

With workers in short supply, contractors begin their poaching Yogesh JoshiWith shortage of workers due to lockdown, industrialists from parts of Pune district have complained about poaching of labourers by contractors. The industrialists during their meeting with Pune divisional Commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar on Wednesday raised the issue of contractors poaching labourers who are currently in short supply after many of them left for their native places at a time when various industries have resumed operations in view of relaxations in the lockdown.“I heard some of the issues raised by industrialists during our meeting. I am now compiling a report to be sent to government for necessary action,” said Mhaisekar on Thursday during the press conference.The Divisional commissioner assured industrialists and members of industry body Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) of issues raised to be addressed.“There is currently mismatch between demand for labourers and supply. As a result of which the labourers are also asking for more wages. It is part of economics,” said Mhaisekar.Industries facing this issue are mostly from Chakan-Talegaon belt where most firms are from automobile sector and has seen reverse migration on large scale.According to Secretary, Federation of Chakan Industries (FCI), Dileep Batwal, there is continuous movement of labourers from Chakan. “With many workers leaving Chakan in past two months, industries are facing massive shortage of labourers. This has resulted in labour contractors poaching workers. The situation may even create law and order problems if the government does not address it immediately,” said Batwal.As per estimates by Federation of Chakan Industries, there are around 2.5 lakh labourers working in various industries of which around 1 lakh have left for home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/massive-movement-of-migrants-as-28-shramik-trains-carry-35-000-migrants-out-of-pune-division/story-p1HmZYHKx3636AXTFomlQJ.html

15-05-2020||Pune||After two months, Covid-19 doctors to get hotel accommodation in Pune||Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad on Thursday, promptly assured hotel accommodation for civic doctors attending patients affected with Sars-cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection when asked about a complaint from a team of doctors. He said ten rooms have been sanctioned for doctors at the government’s VIP guest house.On May 12, a team of 12 doctors serving at the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) Dr Naidu Contagious Diseases Hospital, wrote to municipal commissioner Gaikwad and state chief secretary Ajoy Mehta with a list of grievances that needed to be addressed. One of the main grievances of the doctors was the absence of hotel accommodation, forcing them to go home to their families and risk infecting them.Pune city is among the Covid-19 red zone districts in the country with 163 deaths and 2,800 positive cases as of May 13.When asked about this letter and the grievances raised by the doctors, Gaikwad said he had already issued instructions long back, but apparently they had not been implemented by the lower staff.“We have enough lodging facilities in private hotels and government rest houses with us and I have instructed our officers to provide them to the doctors. We had not received any requests from Naidu Hospital. I have now asked the Naidu hospital administration to provide the list of the doctors and medical staff who wish to avail of these facilities,” Gaikwad said.The doctors spoke about the serious problems they were facing because of the lack of alternate accommodation for them. One of the doctors on condition of anonymity said that he was not being allowed to use the lift in his housing society and had to climb up many floors using the stairs, after a hard day’s work.“After reaching my flat, I remove my clothes in the public area outside the door itself and then enter the house and go straight to the bathroom for a hot water bath,” the doctor said.Another doctor on condition of anonymity said that he had to commute quite a distance from the hospital to his residence and added to this was the risk of infecting his family members which needed to be avoided as was being done for other doctors treating Covid-19 patients.The doctors in their letter said they had been working for the last two months at a stretch even though they were expected to work for 21 days and then spend seven days in quarantine. They pointed out that the district administration had made lodging arrangements for doctors from the Sassoon General Hospital. The same facility should be extended to them..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-two-months-covid-19-doctors-to-get-hotel-accommodation-in-pune/story-cYRtgX66MFcie6SaIW873J.html
15-05-2020||Pune||Domestic violence calls up 12 times in 5 weeks of lockdown, say Pune police||The Women’s social security cell and Bharosa Cell of the Pune police has reported 598 calls from women in distress suffering domestic violence during the one-and-half months of the lockdown from March 10 to April 25. On a monthly basis, this cell receives about 40 calls from women, on an average, said assistant police inspector Swati Kedar Khade from the Social Security Cell of the Pune police.According to Khade who is also coordinator for the Bharosa Cell which seeks to provide assistance and counselling to senior citizens, women and children, the police addressed all the cases by conducting telephonic counselling sessions and visits to homes wherever required.“Most of the calls were about husband harassment or harassment by the in-laws. Problems sometimes arise due to small houses and personality clashes. When such calls come in, we try to persuade them to adjust during the lockdown. We make individual calls to the woman as well as her husband and so far it has worked,” said Khade.While some women were strong, there were others who would start crying over the phone and needed to be pacified. “We have had calls from women who said they had to leave their homes. In such cases, the nearest police personnel visit the house and check the situation. If things cannot be resolved, then the woman is taken to the Women’s rescue home as a temporary arrangement,” she said. Social activist and counsellor Rama Sarode expressed the fear that domestic violence cases could rise in the future with rising job and financial insecurity due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Substance abuse and alcoholism could further aggravate the situation, said Sarode, who is an advocate.She and her husband Asim, a human rights activist and lawyer run the Sahyog Trust. The trust has produced a 3-minute film called “A deep Breathe’ / Ek Lambi Saans on social media to create awareness about domestic violence. This film hints at taking a deep breath to break the pattern of violence. It has some messages on how domestic violence affects the children, the family and how it is not just physical but also verbal. Sarode said she has received more than 20 distress calls of domestic violence since the lockdown began as compared to the regular calls which are more.“The only frustrating this that we do not have a legal recourse from the judiciary as we are not able to file cases during lockdown. Legal aid or any other aid for domestic violence should be considered as part of emergency services by Government,” said Sarode. Sarode said that many cases of domestic abuse go unreported when the women in question do not have access to a phone or is unwilling to report for the sake of her children.Jaya Valenkar, of the women’s rights organisation, Jagori, said for a woman to complain over a helpline, she needs to have access to a telephone while being 100% sure that she is not being overheard. With almost 57% of the women in the country not having access to phones, their options for registering complaints under the lockdown are now limited, said Valenkar. Sometimes, women rely on other family members to report on their behalf. But since the perpetrator is right there, they are unable to seek help, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/domestic-violence-calls-up-almost-12-times-in-5-weeks-of-lockdown-pune-police/story-AO1IremQ01OicXqT2QQSNJ.html
15-05-2020||Pune||2 lakh Nepalese stuck in Pune count days to return home, good samaritans come to their rescue||For thousands of Nepali Nationals who work in Pune, and have made the city their home since many years, the lockdown has spelt disaster. Says Gautam Mohan, “I was working at a small dhaba near Ramwadi and would cook Chinese food. I would get paid Rs 12,000 per month and with my wife also working we were managing our lives well. But when the lockdown was announced, the dhaba shut down and I was suddenly jobless.”Gautam was lucky compared to the 45 men who not only lost their jobs but also had no roof over their heads. Umesh Bista, member of the Nepali Jansampark Samiti Bharat said, “These men worked in various restaurants in and around Vimanagar, Tingrenagar and at night slept there itself. On the day the lockdown was announced they were asked to leave. Now they had no roof over their heads besides no pay.”So Bista and his samiti members got into action. “We took in as many of these men as we could in our own homes. But 16 of them could not be accommodated. So, we rented a shed in Dhanori and kept these men there. Our samiti delivers ration so that these guys can at least feed themselves,” he said.According to Mohanraj Bishwakarma who heads the Pragati Nepali Samaj Bharat, there are about two lakh Nepali nationals working in Pune and PCMC. “At least 50-60% of these people are working in restaurants. And these restaurants are now closed. The result? Most are jobless. Only those who are working as security guards still have their jobs, but for the majority, no income is a serious problem,” he said.Ikram Khan, owner of Soho restaurant in Kalyaninagar who heads the Sarva Dharama Samabhav Trust feeds at least 700-800 Nepalese in and around Kalyaninagar, “It happened quite by chance that my driver Bhim who is a Nepalese told me about his neighbours who all worked in eateries in our area. They had lost their jobs and were hungry at home. So, I packed rations for them. But they had no cooking gas. So, I decided to cook in my restaurants compound. It started with 50 Nepali nationals; however, word spread fast and Nepali nationals from Ramwadi, Kharadi, Vimannagar and nearby places started pouring in. Now I arrange food for 1,000 nationals. Even non-Nepali locals started coming for food. We welcome all,” said Khan.Khan has enlisted 10 Nepali men from the group to cook in his compound. He provides them with the infrastructure like utensils, gas and the ingredients from his restaurant’s kitchen. “My friend Nitin Sahasrabudhe provides 250 eggs daily. The Weikfield group sends us 25 kgs of mushrooms every two or three days. I have drum stick trees in my garden, we pluck those. And I add about 10-12 kgs of bottle gourd. All this is cooked and added to the dal. It is served with the rice. People come here with their own utensils and take the food home for their families. We also pack 250 parcels and give to the migrants on the roads around our area,” Khan added.The Pune Faith Community Church for Nepali nationals too is doing its bit. Says Pradip Bajracharya its pastor, “We have 300 members and most are now jobless. We distribute ration packets that lasts for a week for one family.”While some Nepali nationals are being taken care of by good Samaritans what about the rest of them? Mohanraj says, “We got a message from our Embassy that the govt of India would take care of the Nepali nationals stuck in India and the govt of Nepal would look after the Indians in our country. But that is not happening. We are left to our own devices. We want the Indian govt to consider running trains for us that can take us to the border. Yes, the borders are currently sealed, but they should open up soon. It is not possible for Nepalese to live here without any job or money. We want to go back home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/2-lakh-nepalese-stuck-in-pune-count-days-to-return-home-good-samaritans-come-to-their-rescue/story-KDDL5b9fXefoFJlPYv9mDI.html
15-05-2020||Chandigarh||Summer vacations extended by two weeks in Chandigarh’s government schools||After days of lingering over a decision on whether Chandigarh government and government-aided schools would open or remain closed, the education department said on Thursday that they would remain shut during the lockdown for the next two weeks. The UT administration had earlier announced the summer breaks from April 14 to May 14, during the curfew imposed in the wake of the Covid epidemic. However, written communication to various stakeholders from the office of district education officer says government and government aided schools will remain closed till further orders. The notification comes just a day before schools were supposed to re-open. The move affects over a lakh students studying in 123 government schools and 8 aided schools. Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director of school education, Chandigarh, said, “Schools will remain open during winter vacations and even on Saturdays to make up the loss of instructional hours / teaching days. We can review our decision of vacations anytime as per guidelines of ministry of home affairs and the local situation.”HS Mamik, president of the Independent Schools Association (ISA), said that some schools have suggested they be allowed to open partially, or at least their staff should be allowed to continue on odd-even rotation basis. “Thus with 50% staff attending school on alternate days, social distancing will be easier and material for online learning can also be created easily,” he said, adding that it would also help then understand what preparations are needed before schools are opened.Speaking of this, Brar said, “We have authorised the DEO to give permission to private schools to open partially, subject to certain conditions on a case to case basis.”In most private schools, summer holidays get over by May 17, with students being asked to report the next day. The association of schools said that online classes will run for students till they get clear instructions from the education department on the future course of action.Nitin Goyal, head of the parents body of Chandigarh students, said, “Going by the rising number of Covid infections in the city day by day, all schools must remain closed. Private schools are in a hurry to reopen because they are only eyeing the fees.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/summer-vacay-extended-indefinitely-in-chandigarh-govt-schools/story-JDQ40iGAfhUpuoivPERc0L.html

Many scattered units are also situated in the city. PPCB and the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) had been tightening the noose around the dairy owners for dumping dairy waste into the Buddha Nullah, the seasonal stream which runs through the Malwa region of Punjab and, after passing through Ludhiana, drains into the Sutlej river.One of the dairy owners in Haibowal dairy complex, requesting anonymity, said, “We are not aware of any kind of consent to be obtained from the board which is why we never applied for it. Following MC and PPCB directions, the dairy owners have already stopped dumping waste into the nullah.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/comply-with-pollution-control-norms-or-face-music-punjab-dairy-units-told/story-ZtZGLfxBwEbogoOR3RjKxL.html

If convicted, a person could be jailed for up to a month, or fined Rs 200, or both. Officers associated with cases said one more person has been booked under the same section in Kotla Mubarakpur. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicVijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west), said the action comes in line with the DDMA order of April 22, which called for “strict compliance” of directions that house owners will not demand rent from migrant workers for one month. It required district magistrates to spread awareness about this and, in case of non-compliance, take legal action. In Mukherjee Nagar, most complainants were students preparing for competitive exams. “If they approach us, we try to sort it out with the landlords. If that doesn’t work, we register FIRs,” Arya said. Also Read: Biggest single-day spike as Delhi Covid cases cross 8,000A 22-year-old student, who did not wish to be identified, said his family in Bihar was going through a financial crisis after his father, a diabetes patient, stopped his business fearing infection. “The house owner asked me to either pay rent or vacate. Since I was unable to return home and don’t have anywhere to go, I approached the police and registered a case,” said the student. A student in her 20s who lives in the same neighbourhood said the person who ran her paying guest (PG) facility barred access to the kitchen. “My parents are unable to send money. It was a do or die situation for us. We survived on fruits and snacks for two days before filing a case,” she said, requesting anonymity.

I have Rs 42,000 electricity dues and pay the cook Rs 16,000 per month. If I don’t get some help, how will I be able to continue to accommodate them?” he said. He alleged some students had dues pending for months. BS Vohra, president of East Delhi Residents Welfare Association Joint Front, said while he expected house owners to waive or postpone rent, it was unfair to book them as it could be their only source of income. “An FIR is not the way as it is harassment for both parties. The chief minister must step in,” said Vohra.Prior to the DDMA order, CM Arvind Kejriwal had requested house owners to not insist on for rent for a month or two and if possible, take it in instalments.Varkey Parakkal of Student’s Tenants Union Delhi, said, “We wrote to the Union and Delhi governments, requesting that students’ rents be waived and landlords be compensated since we know many depended on it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/police-book-landlords-for-insisting-on-rent-house-owners-say-they-have-little-choice/story-DWdX59dLGYaG6Vrzuyx3NL.html

15-05-2020||City||Life in lockdown: Unorganised sector in dire need of govt support, says this Ludhiana-based trader||Although summer is the peak season for ready-made garment traders, the lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has forced them to keep their shops shut since March 23, leaving them with no source of revenue.Arvinder Singh Makkar, who owns a wholesale ready-made garment shop in Akal market of Chaura Bazaar in Ludhiana shared that though he has already started receiving orders from shopkeepers in small towns, he has been unable to dispatch the goods to revive the income cycle.“Most of the wholesale shopkeepers already have summer clothes stocked in their shops or godowns that they have not been able to sell due to the lockdown. This is a major concern for us,” said Makkar, who is also the president of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal. He said that a delegation from the association recently requested the district administration to allow them to open shops while putting safety measures in place. “Now everyone is aware of coronavirus and concerned about their safety. We are only requesting the administration to support us in opening our businesses gradually as now we need to live with this virus,” he added.Makkar said the unorganised sectors were hit hard by the curfew and that the government should come to their aid. “The unorganised sector is facing a huge financial crisis. The government should provide businesses with tax benefits and waive off electricity bills,” he added.Amid the lockdown, with his business operation remains shut, Makkar, a resident of Vishal Nagar, has been spending time at home playing online games with his two sons based in United States and Gurugram. “To boost my immunity, I have been doing yoga every day and eating healthy. I’m not so fond of watching television so I spend my day talking to my friends on the phone and playing ludo with my sons online,” he said.Makkar, who will be turning 60 on May 17, said his only wish is that humanity succeeds in winning the war against Covid-19 and the situation normalises soon so that people can earn for their loved ones’ survival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/life-in-times-of-lockdown-unorganised-sector-in-dire-need-of-govt-support-says-ludhiana-based-trader-arvinder-singh-makkar/story-FnF5qnN4UjgVfhq7J92doL.html
15-05-2020||Pune||Pune police provide transport facility to stranded workers||After being stranded for about two days without a roof, a group of about 40 migrant labourers were provided with a private bus by the Pune Police to take them to Madhya Pradesh.At least 30 to 40 migrant labourers took shelter at an open ground near a temple in Vadarwadi, Vishrantwadi after they were left out of the process of boarding a bus which was supposed to take them to the Pune railway station to board the Shramik Express on Monday.The labourers were natives of Damoh, Jabalpur, Narsinghpur, and Shahdol districts of Madhya Pradesh.On Tuesday morning the wage labourers were seen camped outside Vishrantwadi police station.Having been left stranded outside the police station for a day, the labourers went back to their houses in Vadar Vasti area of Vishrantwadi. The workers, however, allege to have been barred from using the houses they had just left unless they pay rent. As the families had nowhere to go they took shelter at an open ground near a temple in Vadarwadi, Vishrantwadi to sleep.They were provided with food by the police station officials on Tuesday evening.“Yesterday (Tuesday), in the evening we got food, and the police then asked us to adjust for one more day,” said Anil Pal, 18, a migrant labourer.“When we went back to the room on Sunday night, the owner refused to open the locks. He said now we will have to pay rent or pay money to use it for one day. So we spent the night in an open ground near the temple,” said Pal.“In the morning (on Wednesday) the police gave us food, sanitiser and masks and a doctor used a machine to check our temperature and we were told to board a bus which will take us to Pune station and later a train to the border of Madhya Pradesh (MP),” said Pal.“After that, we have no idea what will be done. The police were saying that maybe the local government there (in MP) will make some arrangements,” he added.While some labourers had come to the city a few months ago, some had reached merely days before the lockdown was announced.Babita Pal, a woman in her 20s with speech impairment, looked on in desperation to find someone who would understand her. Babita was with her husband and a 4-year-old daughter Vaishnavi. While Vaishnavi clutched on to a packet of biscuits unaware of the chaos.“We have been waiting here to be able to go home. The questions that we ask officials remain all unanswered. I had reached here only five-six days before the lockdown was announced. Since then, I have had no work or money,” said Loh Chand, a man in his 40s, travelling with three other family members.The daily wage earners landed at the police station as they had responded to police calls stating their application had been approved and that they will be put on a bus to the railway station, according to multiple people’s accounts.According to Pournima Gaikwad, DCP, zone 3, said, “Sometimes real count of labourers is higher than the train accommodation. There are few such occasions where we are not able to rehabilitate the labourers (who have left rented home and cannot go back) we take care of their food and accommodation.”“We have made plans to erect temporary shelters for people who are found walking in an attempt to reach home in a different state. They will be provided with food, water, and a space to rest until an accommodation is arranged. We are trying to get the PMC to accommodate them in the shelters for homeless,” said DCP Gaikwad.“We are helping in whatever way we can. In our zone, we have started asking private buses to take people to their states for whoever is willing to pay for the service,” said DCP Pankaj Deshmukh of zone 4.“The private buses also need money to complete the journey. We are urging them to keep the cost as low as possible. We have also made arrangements for doctors for screening and food in a parking lot in Kharadi,” said DCP Deshmukh.“The police at the local level are making as many arrangements as they can. Every zone gets to release only a certain number of people in PMPML buses to the train station as the trains are limited. The information is provided five to six hours prior to the train departure,” according to DCP Gaikwad.In the limited time, hopeful travellers are called upon; some make it to the train, some are left behind, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-police-provide-transport-facility-to-stranded-workers/story-Aw0YPnApXJkQSg3Ho86SzL.html
15-05-2020||Pune||Concerned about new discharge protocols by ICMR: Covid-19 hospital CEO||PUNE: The Union health ministry’s revised discharge guidelines for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients has evoked concern from the chief executive of a prominent hospital in Pune engaged in the treatment of Covid-19 patients.“The recommendations suggest that we should discharge such patients (mild/very mild/pre-symptomatic cases) by the 10th day without doing the virus swab test. We have seen patients who are swab positive even on the 14th and 15th days and some extending up to the 25th or 30th days. Premature discharge of such patients from the hospital will lead to a continuing spread of the virus within the community,” cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr. Vijay Natarajan said.Chief executive officer (CEO) of the Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre, Lavale, he noted that the recommendation of enforcing 14 days home quarantine “is very impractical in most Indian small-sized households”.The hospital at Lavale, has devoted a separate five storey building for the Covid-19 pandemic with a capacity of 500 isolation beds which includes 30 beds in the ICU (intensive care unit) with four ventilators. It has a dedicated staff of 200 nurses and 150 doctors, including faculty and resident doctors. COn May 9, the Union health ministry revised its discharge guidelines for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients stating that mild/very mild/pre-symptomatic cases admitted to a Covid-19 care facility will undergo regular temperature and pulse oximetry monitoring.“The patient can be discharged after 10 days of symptom onset and no fever for 3 days. There will be no need for testing prior to discharge. At the time of discharge, the patient will be advised to follow the home isolation for further 7 days as per guidelines available at (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/GuidelinesforHomeIsolationofverymildpresymptomaticCOVID19case s.pdf),” the guidelines said.The government’s previous rules said a laboratory-confirmed case had to be tested on day 14 once and then again in a span of 24 hours. If both the results were negative then the patient was fit to be discharged from the health care facility.Dr. Natarajan noted that while the government machinery was doing its best within the limited resources of manpower, infrastructure and equipment, “it is extremely important that policies be guided by scientific evidence rather than administrative convenience.”At the hospital, Covid-19 patients are being admitted since April 8 and the average occupancy has been varying from around 150 to 200 patients and about 8 to 10 patients in the ICU. Till date a total of 415 patients have been treated in the hospital of which 285 have been discharged. The CEO expressed satisfaction that all the necessary precautions were being taken and his hospital did not have a single case of infection among the healthcare staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ceo-of-covid-19-hospital-expresses-concern-over-new-discharge-rules/story-a5Kyy3Oe9lC6nMe7wYpwaM.html
