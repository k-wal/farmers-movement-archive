The Maharashtra government needs to look into this matter seriously.”He said the migrants need to be registered and their personal details, as well as identification proof, should be submitted to the local police station.Congress state unit chief and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat also slammed CM Aadityanath, saying that Maharashtra has been playing the role of ‘aunt’ to the migrants because UP failed to take care of them as a ‘mother’. “We have taken care of the migrants for the last two months of the lockdown by providing them food, shelter and making arrangements for their journey back home. In fact, they have complained of being deprived basic facilities after reaching to their home state of UP,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-bona-fide-migrants-should-be-allowed-to-work-in-maharashtra-raj-thackeray/story-EyCd9lku0D81S92Mc789pO.html

The city also reported 1,430 new Covid-19 patients, taking the total number of cases to 31,972. The overall fatality rate of Mumbai is now 3.2%. A total of 8,404 patients have been cured and discharged. Dharavi on Monday recorded 42 new cases, taking the total count for the area to 1,583. No new deaths were recorded in Dharavi on Monday. War room planAmid criticism that patients are finding it hard to get beds at public hospitals, the state and city authorities are working out a system to improve the situation on the ground. Each of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) major hospitals — Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General, BYL Nair, KEM, JJ, and all peripheral hospitals — has been assigned an IAS officer and will also get an individual war room with CCTV cameras installed in each Covid-19 and ICU ward. The war rooms will manage a real-time dashboard of bed availability, and data will be updated every 30 minutes. According to information released by the civic body, each bed at these hospitals will also be given a unique identification code for better management through BMC’s centralised system of the helpline 1916. Bed capacityBy May 31, Mumbai will have beds to accommodate 44,000 active Covid-19 cases, despite the number of active cases expected by that date is predicted to be only 28,000, BMC said. The civic body currently had 30,000 tier-2 Covid care centre (CCC2) beds and is planning to reach a target of 14,000 dedicated Covid hospital beds. After acquiring 80% of the beds at private hospitals, 2,624 Covid beds and 3,020 non-Covid beds have been added to the city’s pool. These beds will be allotted to patients by BMC, at government-controlled rates, while the remaining 20% will be available with the hospital for commercial use. BMC also took over 100% of the ICU beds at 33 private hospitals, increasing its capacity by 417 Covid ICU beds, and 538 non-Covid ICU beds at government rates. Each of BMC’s 24 wards will have an additional 100 general beds and 20 ICU beds from other private hospitals. Those with diabetes, hypertension at greater riskAs of Monday, of the total number of deaths in the city, 67% of victims had co-morbidities. Around 26% had diabetes; 24% had hypertension; in 32% of the deaths, both diabetes and hypertension were found; 8% of the victims had heart disease, and 10% had other co-morbidities. Of the total Covid positive cases in Mumbai, 5,709 were above 60 years old cases and 463 of the deaths were also from this age group, which has the highest fatality rate of 8.1%. Among victims below 50 years of age, 20% had comorbidities.Till Monday, 11,517 cases were from the 40-60 years age group (456 deaths; 4% fatality rate). The highest number of cases (13,133) was recorded in the age group below 40 years, with 69 deaths and a fatality rate of 0.5%. Of the total cases, 40% were of women and 60% of men; 37% of the total deaths were of women and 63% of men. Of the 38 deaths recorded on Monday, 27 had comorbidities; 26 were men and 12 were women. Three deaths were of patients below 40 years; 15 of the victims were above 60 and 20 were between 40 and 60 years of age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-death-toll-crosses-1-000-mark-ias-officers-assigned-to-all-major-hospitals/story-aVWzWjgnNLuQ2cUoMING0K.html
25-05-2020||Mumbai||Landlords demand rent despite government advisory, claim they have no choice||Despite the state government’s advisory last month to defer rents by three months, landlords and homeowners have now started putting pressure on tenants to pay the rent or face eviction.Landlords have pointed out that for a majority of them, rent is the main source of income. The tenants meanwhile contend that they have not received income for the last two months and are in no position to pay up.“I have had no work since the last three months due to the lockdown and I can’t pay the rent. The landlords need to reduce the rents,” said Amrutaa Dasgupta, an actor who resides at Yari Road. “As the landlord was pressuring me, I had to ask the police to intervene as there was no way I could even vacate this place,” she said.The state government on April 17 had issued an advisory asking landlords and homeowners to defer collecting rents by three months given the lockdown has affected the source of income of many people.However, landlords have defended their stance, pointing out that even they have expenses. “I have to pay my EMIs and will not be able to pay them if I don’t get the rent. If the tenant delays, the bank will charge me interest for the same,” said Chandramohan Sharma, who has rented out his premises at Juhu.Some property owners have given discounts to their tenants. “I have asked my tenant to pay half the rent since even they have no income. However, it is not possible to waive off the entire amount as even my expenses will get affected,” said Sachin Gala, who is renting out his Hindmata flat.According to Liases Foras, a real estate research firm, there are at least 5.50 lakh houses in Mumbai that are put on rent. “The condition will only worsen in the coming days, especially due to job losses and salary cuts,” said Pankaj Kapoor, CEO, Liases Foras.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/landlords-demand-rent-despite-government-advisory-claim-they-have-no-choice/story-IkG98qKH6sJMjEoXyO16RP.html
25-05-2020||Mumbai||Fisherman seeks HC intervention to set up testing facilities in Ratnagiri||The Bombay high court has directed the state to respond to the plea of a fisherman from Ratnagiri who has complained that ever since intra-state travelling was permitted, Ratnagiri had seen a surge in Covid cases. The petitioner has claimed that till April-end there were only seven positive cases, of which two died. However, after travel restrictions were lifted there were 108 cases. He further informed the court that as samples had to be sent 237 kms away to Sangli and Miraj, results were delayed, hence additional testing facilities should be set up in Ratnagiri itself.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice SS Shinde, while hearing public interest litigation filed by a fisherman Khalil Ahmad Hasanmiya Wasta through video conferencing, were informed by advocate Rakesh Bhatkar that the entire Konkan region had been declared a non-red zone since the Covid-19 outbreak. He further submitted that since travel restrictions had been lifted to allow stranded students and migrants to return home to Konkan and Ratnagiri, there was an apprehension that the number of cases would rise.Bhatkar submitted the data prior and post the lifting of travel restrictions and said that there was a visible increase in the number of Covid-19 positive cases. The plea pointed out, “state authorities issued passes to migrants and 44,531 applications were allowed to enter Ratnagiri district and nearly 30,000 persons entered without official passes. As per government data, 29,259 persons are home quarantined. A district with a population of 16.15 lakh persons has six functioning hospitals, out of which two hospitals are reserved for Covid-19 treatment.” In light of the above, the petition said that the administration was not equipped to meet with the increased demand for Covid testing.Bhatkar informed the court that as there was a shortage of testing facilities and samples were being sent to Sangli and Miraj which was already inundated with samples from other districts. As a result, the testing units there were unable to provide timely reports and hence testing facilities should be set up in Ratnagiri as per the ICMR list.After hearing the submissions, the court directed government pleader Priyabhushan Kakade to take instructions from the authorities and asked him to respond to the plea during the next hearing on May 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fisherman-seeks-hc-intervention-to-set-up-testing-facilities-in-ratnagiri/story-FnNDsVXjN1ujFfvBFK9q0L.html
25-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC is testing at 65% of its capacity||Even as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) increases the number of tests conducted for Covid-19 in the city, experts have urged the civic body to expand the scope of testing. At present, BMC is at 65% of the official testing capacity.According to BMC, around 4,500 samples are tested daily for Covid-19. The official testing capacity of private and government labs is over 7,000 samples a day.“We have extended the lab capacity as a precautionary measure if Covid-19 cases spike further. We are conducting enough tests every day,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, BMC.BMC’s data shows that between May 13 and May 23, despite the increased testing capacity, fewer than 4,500 tests were conducted on many days. For example, BMC conducted 2,673 tests on May 13; 3,112 on May 14; 3,260 on May 18; and 3,209 on May 22.The data also shows 32 of every 100 tested samples are Covid-positive. Most tests are conducted in containment zones and hotspots. “As these areas have the highest number of cases, the rate of identification of Covid-19 is also high. This means we are testing the right section,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.Experts said the identification rate shows more tests are needed. “Mumbai has a population of over 2 crore. We are testing around 4,500 samples which is far from adequate. The more we test, the more we identify, and the more we can stop the chain of infection,” said Anant Bhan, global health expert. However, laboratories say they’re working at capacity. “Every day, we get over 600 samples. Some days, it goes over 900. This causes a pile-up of samples and we fail to give reports within 24 hours. At present, I have 300 samples that came on Friday,” said a lab technician from a private laboratory. Last week, BMC instructed labs that Covid-19 test results must be declared within 24 hours of receipt of samples.For those with severe cases of Covid-19, delays in receiving results can be critical.On May 10, a 35-year-old resident of Vakola developed a fever. After an x-ray indicated he had pneumonia, he tried to get himself admitted but was refused by two hospitals. On May 13, he tested for Covid-19 at Hinduja Hospital. The test results came on May 16. “No one agreed to admit him without a Covid-19 test. For 48 hours, he was at home without any medication,” said the patient’s brother. The patient was died in hospital, a few hours after being admitted on May 16. The Association of Medical Consultants (AMC) has criticised BMC’s Covid-19 policy. “First, as patients don’t get treatment until they get the report, their health deteriorates. Then they are rushed to hospitals, and collapse within hours. As there is no policy to treat suspected patients, they are either kept at home or quarantined in facilities. Due to this, more people get infected,” said Dr Deepak Baid, president, AMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-is-testing-at-65-of-its-capacity/story-mrqbpwIFyYFnFlnOmm5Q5L.html
25-05-2020||City||RWAs worry as Panchkula admn allows domestic helps to work in houses||Resident welfare associations (RWAs) are worried as the administration has issued orders allowing domestic helps to work in houses in Panchkula. The Federation of Residents’ Association (FORA), Panchkula, took up the matter and said that house maids, vendors and pedestrians could be seen flowing down the sectors without properly covering their faces with masks. FORA president RP Malhotra said, “Maids need financial help and it is the duty of the administration to give them a monthly assistance for sustenance instead of just allowing them to carry on with their jobs as if everything was back to normal.” “As per the instructions issued by the administration, it is difficult for people to provide their maids a place to stay in their houses. As such it is not only that the maids can infect residents, but they too can get infected from people as they work in a multiple houses,” said Malhotra. He said that if at all household workers were to be allowed to work, the administration should get them all screened or tested against the Covid-19. Malhotra further said that the association had taken up the matter with the deputy commissioner as well, but got no response as yet.FORA senior vice-president Bharat Hiteshi said the benefits of lockdown had been nullified by massive relaxations such as allowing maids to work and opening of parks where people throng in group with caring about social distancing norms. Not satisfied with orders restricting senior citizens and kids below 10 years from walking in parks, the association members said that it’ the aged people who need to boost their immunity the most and keep themselves in high spirits. They said keeping them confined to their homes would only add to their loneliness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rwas-worry-as-panchkula-admn-allows-domestic-helps-to-work-in-houses/story-B3STJdEqq5EocRAxspftTO.html

Five friends set out on three motorcycles on Sunday night for Haji Malang, 17km from their house. They carried food with them. “On the way up the hill to the dargah, a group of people asked them to leave as lockdown was in place. They had an argument,” said Shahanawaj.“My brother and his friends came downhill and were discussing where to go when the group, probably locals, followed them. They started frisking my brother and his friends and checking their mobile phones. Then, they started beating them. One of them took out a sharp object and stabbed my brother four times,” said Shahanawaj.Shadab was bleeding and his friends managed to get out of the area and took him to hospital but he was declared dead.Shadab was working as a customer care service officer in a company in Mumbai and had got married in February.When the police reached the spot, they found a mobile phone. Later in the morning when a man came looking for the phone, he was detained by the police.Deputy commissioner of police, P Shewale, said, “Our team reached the spot after being alerted about the murder. We have registered a murder case. We are questioning the villagers and have detained a few persons for questioning but we are yet to make any arrest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/24-year-old-stabbed-to-death-near-haji-malang/story-bST2k72P0jVotbqwh0C7ZL.html
25-05-2020||Mumbai||Do not reopen schools in June, stakeholders tell education department||As the state education department is exploring possible options to reopen schools in some parts of the state in June, experts have said the government should not rush to restart schools.The department had asked for suggestions from the stakeholders including school owners, principals and parents regarding reopening schools in the state. Most responses opposed starting of schools before July. “While red zone areas are at a high risk, even green zones have some risk involved because migration is taking place from red zones to green zones and cases might come up. Reopening schools might put the lives of lakhs of students at risk, and thus needs to be pushed as late as possible,” said the head of a school chain in Mumbai. On May 23, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad spoke to a set of experts and senior officials in the education department. “Almost all stakeholders agreed that classes must not begin for primary students till at least July-end. Some suggested extending the guidelines for students till Class 8. School for Classes 9 and 10 could begin in green zones and orange zones,” said an expert present at the meeting. Parents said the department should wait and continue with online teaching until the risk is completely eliminated. “There is no point in hurrying at the moment as we all know there is immense risk involved. Parents won’t send their children to schools in such a situation even if they reopen,” said Anubha Sahai, president of the India Wide Parents Association. Anil Bornare, coordinator of BJP Teachers Cell, said in cities like Mumbai where many schools are in densely populated areas, following social distancing norms is a tough task. “It is okay if there is a delay in reopening but this risk cannot be taken,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/do-not-reopen-schools-in-june-stakeholders-tell-education-department/story-ULbMG6VGEKuBXOJRmPhQcM.html

25-05-2020||Mumbai||With migrants leaving city, housing societies face shortage of security staff||Several housing societies in the city have lost their security guards as migrant workers have started leaving the city. A considerable chunk of the migrants who left the city were security personnel manning building gates or commercial establishments; and their departure has led to a dearth of manpower. In many housing societies, members have started taking turns for daily chores such as operating water pumps and electricity meters, while a few others have wooed their security personnel with extra incentives. Agencies providing security personnel said half of their workforce has left and there was no possibility of their return anytime soon. “Housing societies are complaining about shortage of security personnel as most of them have left the city in the past few days. Working committees of the societies are facing many challenges; from complying with the municipal corporation norms related to health protocols of tenants to arranging security. In the absence of the security personnel, the tenants are left with no option but to take responsibilities of daily chores including operations of water pumps and electricity meters,” said Nitin Nikam, president, Tilak Nagar Residents Welfare Association. He also said that in the absence of the security personnel, incidents of thefts are on the rise and are expected to increase gradually. Amar Bahadur Singh, partner, Ranger Security Services, said 60% of his workforce has left the job and many among the remaining are about to leave at the first possible opportunity. “Most of the security personnel engaged in Mumbai are from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, and draw monthly salary between ₹8,000 and ₹15,000. We have not been able to provide security personnel to many housing societies despite having agreements,” he said. He, however, said there would be a trend of influx in the next few weeks as the labourers cannot afford to stay back in their home states. “There are no jobs and other facilities there in their home states, making it difficult for them to look after their families by living there,” he said.Mahendra Hemdev of Marine Drive Residents Association said the society he lives in has made arrangements for helps and security personnel to stay at building premises. “They come from far flung areas like Virar and Vasai with their families at their native places. We could retain them because of the arrangements. I know a society in Khar where the society members manage everything from security to other activities themselves after their security personnel left,” he said. Santosh Singh, director of Bombay Intelligence Security – an agency with more than 7,000 employees serving various societies in the city, said, “We have been managing our workforce by providing them accommodation and food facilities. We fear that many of our employees may leave after drawing this month’s salary. Many of them have made their passes and are waiting for their turns.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/with-migrants-leaving-city-housing-societies-face-shortage-of-security-guards/story-iStnd75RHCz8HilJxVqcsM.html
25-05-2020||Mumbai||Recovery rate of Covid positive BEST staff crosses 50%||The recovery rate of Covid-19 positive employees of the Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking reached 50% on Monday with four patients getting discharged in a single day, said BEST officials.Data released by undertaking on Monday states that of the 208 BEST staffers, who tested positive including five cases reported on Monday, 104 have successfully battled the disease and have been discharged. There have also been eight deaths.“As compared to others (other government undertakings), till date we have managed to control the spread of the virus among our staffers. We are the only public undertaking who managed a recovery rate of 50%. There were around eight fatalities; we are working on it,” said Dr Anil Kumar Singhal, chief medical officer, BEST.In addition, 80% of the patients currently under treatment are either asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms. BEST administration is confident that more patients will be discharged soon and the recovery rate will increase further. However, three staffers have been admitted in intensive care units (ICU) while 10 are on oxygenated beds in critical condition.Elaborating on the matter, Singhal said the first BEST employee tested positive on April 14, following which BEST medical department with civic health staff conducted massive screening operation. Thousands of BEST workers and their family members who possibly came in contact with positive patients have been screened for symptoms since then.“This immediate screening of suspected patients helps identify positive patients at their early stage, which helps improve chances of recovery,” said Singhal.However, Shashank Sharad Rao, leader of BEST Sanyukta Kamgar Kruti Samiti (BSKKS), accused BEST administration of poor management. “The number of BEST staffers testing positive each day is increasing because the administration is not taking proper care of its staff. There were no social distancing in buses and staffers were carrying out duty without gloves and sanitiser.”Refuting these allegations, Singhal said BEST is taking all necessary steps to maintain the health and safety of their staffers and their family members.More than 150 staffers were kept under home quarantine to avoid further spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/recovery-rate-of-covid-positive-best-staff-crosses-50/story-W6YFlIe4BW6Tk6NHqgcuIN.html

25-05-2020||Noida||Noida’s wholesale vegetable market will open only for three hours daily||From Wednesday, the wholesale market for vegetables and fruits in Noida Sector 88 will now be open only for three hours. The timings have been changed due to the reduction in number of vendors visiting the market as many vegetable sellers have left for their home towns in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, officials said.“The market will be open for only three hours from 4am to 7am from Wednesday onwards. Presently, the market is functioning from 10pm to 6am. Shop owners had requested the change in timings as vendors usually come in the wee hours. Also, earlier over 400 trucks were arriving at the mandi, but now less than 200 truck-load goods are being sold,” said Santosh Kumar Yadav, secretary of Noida Mandi Board, on Monday.Regarding maintaining of social distancing, Yadav said, “We are trying to maintain it as far as possible.” There are a total of 115 shops in the mandi which sell vegetables and fruits. However, shop owners at the mandi complained that the visiting vendors do not follow the social distancing norms. “When we try to stop them, they start quarrelling with us. But all visitors are being given entry through the sanitization tunnel,” said Mange Ram Sharma, a representative of Shop Owners’ Welfare Association.Raj Singh, another member of the association, said that there’s a fall in the number of sellers as well as buyers by more than 50%. “Hence, we requested to reschedule the timings of the market. Three hours in the early morning are sufficient as only a few buyers and sellers would come at nights,” Singh said.Meanwhile, Gajendra Tyagi, secretary, Dadri Mandi Board, said, “At Dadri, we just have 20 shops where vegetables are sold. Presently, around 200 quintal vegetables are sold daily. We are trying to maintain the social distancing norms.” Salim, a shop owner in Dadri mandi, said, “We are operating in three shifts to maintain social distancing.”Malkhan Singh, secretary, Dankaur and Jewar Mandi Board, said, “At Dankaur, around 15 shops sell vegetables and around 35 vendors sell vegetables at Jewar. We are maintaining proper social distance.” Farmers complain of low price for their produceDue to the lockdown, farmers, who sell their produce at the wholesale mandi in Noida Sector 88, said they are getting Rs 2 to 8 per kilogram for various vegetables in auctions. However, whole sellers are selling the produce for Rs10 to 15 per kg and retailers sell it at Rs 20 to 25 in residential sectors.Virendra Dhada, farmer leader and former chairman of district panchayat, said on Monday, “Farmers bring their produce to the wholesale market. Their produce is auctioned here. For tomatoes these days, farmers normally get Rs 2 to Rs 3 per kg. They are sold at Rs 10 per kg by in wholesalers. Then retailers purchase the vegetable from here and sell it at Rs 20 to Rs 25 per kg.”“Likewise, cucumber is purchased from farmers at Rs 5 per kg. It is sold in wholesale at Rs 10 to 15, and at Rs 20 to 40 in retail. Bitter gourd purchased from farmers at Rs 7 per kg is sold at Rs 15 to 20 in wholesale and Rs 40 to 50 in urban residential areas by retailers. While for lady fingers, farmers get Rs 8 per kg, and the vegetable is sold at Rs 15 to 20 at wholesale and Rs 40 to 50 in retail,” said Dhada.Hargovind Singh, a vegetable farmer who came to the wholesale market, said, “In the last one week, I got a price of Rs 2 to 3 per kg for tomatoes in auction at the mandi.

The cause of the fire is yet unknown, and the authority has set up a six-person committee, to be headed by its additional chief executive officer Praveen Mishra, to probe the matter.The Noida building was shut on Monday when the fire broke out due to Eid, and there were no injuries. Four fire tenders were sent to the spot, and doused the fire in two hours. The office is housed in a single-storey building near the arterial Udyog Marg. Officials said it seemed the fire may have caused due to a short circuit, but added that the exact cause would be determined only after the probe report is submitted.“We got a call at 9.10am about a fire in the industrial accounts section of the building. We used four fire tenders to control the fire. No one was injured, but some files were burnt,” said Arun Kumar, Gautam Budh Nagar’s chief fire officer.The committee has been asked to submit the probe report in a week’s time, officials said.The committee will also aim to establish responsibility for the incident, and will evaluate losses in the fire. Crucial files in the industrial department related to land allotment and other details related to industrial property were unaffected.“Only the false ceiling and some furniture caught fire in the industrial department,” said Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty, Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/probe-ordered-after-fire-breaks-out-at-noida-authority-s-main-admin-building-none-hurt/story-2tVoetUeuDiKI5CQjPmqfK.html
25-05-2020||Delhi||Six workers in home quarantine evicted by house owner for not paying rent||A man was arrested for evicting six tenants who were under home quarantine in outer Delhi’s Nangloi, after they came in contact with a Covid-19 patient, for not paying their rent, the police said on Monday.While the police are yet to contact the evicted men, all of whom are daily wage workers, an investigator said they have reached their village in Bihar’s Bhojpur district, after hiring a private vehicle.The landlord, Sona Lal (41), was booked under the Indian Penal Code’s Section 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by a public servant) and the Disaster Management Act’s Section 51 (refusal to comply with government’s directions), according to A Koan, deputy commissioner of police (outer district).“In the first week of May, two of these workers had visited Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital to meet a friend who had fallen. That man was later tested positive for Covid-19,” Koan said.“The two men and the four others they lived with were put under home quarantine,” he said.Koan said that they were put under home quarantine from May 11 to May 25 on the orders of the Punjabi Bagh sub-divisional magistrate.“On Friday evening, when a constable visited them to ensure they were complying with quarantine norms, he found the six men were missing,” the DCP said.“We booked and arrested the landlord after we were informed that he had evicted the six men,” Koan said.The officer said neighbours and residents of the area said the men were evicted for not paying rent.An officer involved in the investigation said Sona Lal denied the claims, and said the six sneaked out of the house on Wednesday without informing him.“While we continue to probe his claims, why would the tenants sneak out when only five days of their quarantine remained? If that was the case, the owner of the house should have alerted us,” the investigator said.In April, an order by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority had called for “strict compliance” of directions that landlords will not demand rent from migrant workers and students for a month. It required respective district magistrates to spread awareness about this directive and, in case of non-compliance, take legal action.The Delhi high court, last week, had ordered that while tenants would be liable to pay rent for the period the city has been under lockdown, the payments could be postponed owing to the circumstances.If convicted under the IPC’s Section 188, Lal could be jailed for a month, be fined Rs 200,or both. If he is found guilty under the Disaster Management Act, he could face between one or two years in prison.Since the lockdown, there have been multiple instances of confrontations between house owners and tenants over rent payments. The police have also booked several landlords for evicting their tenants or forcing them to pay rent during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/six-workers-in-home-quarantine-evicted-by-house-owner-for-not-paying-rent/story-u2emicyLff8NbLdt5ctMCK.html
25-05-2020||Noida||Zee News channel’s office sealed in Noida, 14 new cases reported||The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration on Monday sealed five-storeyed building of Zee Media in Film City, Sector 16A for its thorough sanitization and disinfection after another employee tested positive from a different floor of the building. All the previous cases of the media company were from fourth floor of the building, but an employee tested positive from second floor on May 24, health officials said.“Based on the finding of new positive case in different floor of the building, the entire building has been closed for sanitization and containment of the disease to other places as per the Epidemic Disease (COVID-19) Regulation Act, 2020. The entry of employees has been stopped till the building is completely disinfected,” Dr Sunil Dohre, district surveillance officer, said in a release on Monday.The release further stated that after due sanitization and following the safety protocols, the building will get fitness certificate from health officials to resume its operation.On Monday, 10 employees of the news channel tested positive. “All patients were in institutional quarantine. While nine of them hailed from GB Nagar, one was cross-notified to Delhi. They all have been shifted to the hospital for treatment. The five-storey office building has been closed for sanitization and disinfection,” said Dohre.So far, a total of 49 Zee Media employees have been found positive for the infection. Of the 49 patients, 33 are from GBN, the health officials said. After the first case was reported from Zee on May 15, the health department had taken 51 samples of employees, of which 28 were found Covid-19 positive. Till now, health officials have screened 400 employees of the organization to trace close contacts of the positive patients. Besides, samples of 50 more employees who are close contacts of the positive patients are collected and they have been put under institutional quarantine, the officials said.When contacted, Sudhir Chaudhary, editor-in-chief of Zee News, said that right from day 1, when the first lot of his employees were sent for sampling, Zee Media is following all the Covid-19 safety norms. “It is the biggest media house that has volunteered sampling of all its employees. For us, the safety of our employees is on top priority. We are getting the tests of those employees at our own cost, where the district administration is not able to do it on time,” he said.Hoping that his team will emerge as Corona warriors soon, he said most of the employees are either quarantined or have been assigned to work from home. “I am sure that our team of dedicated journalists will soon come into action again,” Chaudhary said.Meanwhile, the overall tally of Covid-19 cases in the district has gone to 359 with addition of 14 new cases on Monday. However, five patients, undergoing treatment for the coronavirus disease, were discharged after being cured, the health officials said. The district surveillance officer said that of these 14 new Covid-19 cases, 13 were tested positive from different government labs in the district while one was tested positive in a private lab. “Till Monday evening, the number of positive cases reported in the district was 359. Of them, 235 people have been discharged from different hospitals. While five patients have so far lost their lives and 16 have been cross notified from other districts and states, we now have only 119 active cases,” Dohre said.About other five patients, Dohre said that they were from various areas of the district and were found suffering from influenza like illness. “The list includes a 55-year-old male of Sector 105, a 63-year-old male of Sector 12, an 11-year-old boy of Sector 5, a 24-year-old male from Salarpur village and a 68-year-old female of Sector 36,” he said.The district surveillance officer also said that so far 10,222 samples have been taken for testing in the district. “Since Sunday, 199 samples have been sent to different government laboratories and another 144 samples to the private laboratories. GB Nagar’s sampling ratio of 4,867 samples per million is also better than national sampling ratio of 2,333. This shows strong surveillance system in the district,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/zee-news-channel-s-office-sealed-in-noida-14-new-cases-reported/story-XiiXvREeNF3950yQA5nwyK.html
25-05-2020||Noida||Eid in lockdown, special meals in community kitchens, prayers at home||With several areas of the two cities being containment zones, Noida and Ghaziabad saw deserted mosques as people celebrated the festival of Eid in their homes and offered prayers indoors. Stating that this is one of the most isolated Eids they have ever experienced, imams of different mosques in Noida supported the social distancing and praying at homes, saying this is for the well being of everyone.Meanwhile, community kitchens in Noida prepared special meals for poor and migrant workers on Monday, with the community kitchen at Mamura, one of the biggest in the city, adding sewaiyan (sweet vermicelli) to its menu for over 12,000 people.“A festival is a festival but given the current scenario this is the best we could do. For Eid, we decided to change the menu for a day so instead of regular khichdi or sabzi-chapatti, we prepared poori, sabzi, pulao and sewaiyan for lunch and it was distributed among 12,000 people, including those living in the slums of Chijarsi, sector 62 and 63, and the shelter home at Mamura, including others,” said Vir Singh, a tehsildar and head of the Mamura community kitchen. He added that though the number of takers of meals have dropped by two to three thousands due to the reverse-migration, meals are however still being served.At the Harola community kitchen as well, the menu was made special to mark the occasion. “We replaced regular khichdi with poori and sabzi for Eid today and about 8,000 meals were distributed today,” said Rajiv Malhotra, head, Harola community kitchen in Noida.According to the imam of Greater Noida’s Shahberi mosque, Muhammad Zakir Nadvi, only five people went to the mosque as a festive gesture to offer prayers, while it was made clear for others to offer prayers at their respective homes.“Last year, over 2,000 people offered prayers on Eid at the Shahberi mosque but this year, it was only five of us. Word was spread that people must read namaaz and celebrate Eid within their houses. Right now, the highest priority is to fight this pandemic,” said Nadvi. He added that the mosque at Sector76 and the Jama Mosque at Sector 8 also bore a deserted look, with only five people offering prayers, against a gathering of over 10,000 seen last year.Raza, who works as an electrician, also had a distinct Eid. While his family was stuck in the Sarfabad area of Noida, which was declared a containment zone and sealed a few days back, he got stuck elsewhere and now lives at a friend’s place in Bhangel, Noida.“On Saturday night, my area was declared a containment zone while I was still out installing an AC somewhere. My family suggested I stay out and go to a friend’s place so I can still continue my work. This Eid is so different, when even indoors, I can’t celebrate with my family despite being in the same city,” he said.Zakir Ali, a resident of Ghaziabad’s Dasna, also said that the Eid was different, but he supported the call of social distancing.“Everyone in our area stayed indoors and it was clarified earlier only that the mosques will remain closed. This is the first time when I did not go to the mosque on Eid, but I understand. It’s this pandemic that we need to stop first. Thankfully, our country is safe from its clutches as compared with the way it spread in Italy and the US, so we support the administration,” said Ali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/eid-in-lockdown-special-meals-in-community-kitchens-prayers-at-home/story-3CyfVHmHLI6hEgAAoo9VBO.html
25-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Doctors, staff of Women’s Hospital in quarantine after 30-year-old woman tests positive for Covid-19||Ghaziabad: At least 13 healthcare workers, including five doctors, at the Women’s Hospital in Ghaziabad were sent to 14 days of quarantine after a 30-year-old woman, who delivered twins on May 23, tested positive for the coronavirus (Covid-19) on the evening of May 24. The hospital authorities said that by the time the reports of the woman came through, at least 23 normal deliveries and six C-sections has been done in the same labour room after the 30-year-old’s delivery.According to hospital authorities, the woman, who is from Siddharth Vihar, was admitted to the hospital, located within the MG Hospital complex, on May 23 and delivered her first daughter, at around 4pm while she delivered her second daughters 41 minutes later. She was discharged on the afternoon of May 24. She as well as the twins have now been admitted to the Sanjay Nagar District Hospital, a dedicated Covid facility.“We had got her sampling done on May 22 and the reports came out positive for Covid-19 on the evening of May 24. But by then the damage was done. We prepared a list of our staff who had attended to the delivery and other works. These include five doctors and five nurses besides one pharmacist and two class IV employees. All these were sent to quarantine at a facility arranged for them at the third floor of the hospital on Monday,” said Dr Deepa Tyagi, the chief medical superintendent of the hospital.The hospital has also suspended deliveries on Monday and referred patients to other government facilities in Ghaziabad and Meerut.“We took up only one delivery at 5am on Monday as the woman was admitted with us. Rest of the eight women who were admitted for deliveries were sent to other government facilities in ambulances to Meerut and Dasna in Ghaziabad,” Dr Tyagi added.The health department late Sunday night had issued a list of 10 positive cases and the list included two Covid-19 positive pregnant women - one of these is the woman from Siddharth Vihar while the other is a Nandgram resident.“The records of the second woman from Nandgram are being traced. So far, we have come to know that the second woman did not deliver at our hospital and possibly mentioned wrongly in the list,” Dr Tyagi added.Woman, husband and twins kept in waiting for two hours in ambulance:To add to woes, the woman from Siddharth Vihar, after she tested positive, was brought to the L2 category dedicated Covid-19 hospital at the Sanjay Nagar District Hospital but the staff also brought along her husband in the same ambulance with couple’s two newborn daughters.“We waited with our two daughters in the ambulance for two hours but hospital officials did not admit my wife to the hospital. The ambulance was made to wait at the gate of the Covid ward in scorching heat,” the husband said.Ambulance driver Vinod Kumar and emergency medical technician Brij Kishor, who were tasked to ferry the woman in the ambulance, said that the ambulance arrived at the hospital at around 11.57am and kept waiting till 1.50pm.“The hospital authorities and the chief medical officer (CMO) were in talks about whether to admit the twins along with the mother or not. We have the Covid-19 positive report of the patient. But the discussion took time and the couple kept waiting in the ambulance at the main gate,” Vinod Kumar said.Dr NK Gupta, CMO, said he will inquire why the husband of the woman was brought along in the same ambulance.“There was absolutely no need to bring her husband in the same ambulance. There was delay in admitting the woman as initially, the Sanjay Nagar hospital authorities told us that the reports of the woman were not available with them. Later, there was a delay to finalise whether the newborn twins should be admitted to the hospital along with their mother or not. Finally, it was decided that the twins will be admitted and their Covid-19 tests will be conducted,” the CMO said.Over the issue of quarantine of the staff members of the Women’s Hospital, the CMO said that they will be in quarantine for a period of 14 days.“We will get their tests conducted. The entire labour room was sanitised as per procedure and will resume functioning from Tuesday. We are also getting the list of other women whose deliveries were conducted in the same labour room. Their tests will also be conducted,” he added.Dr Naresh Vij, the chief medical superintendent of the Sanjay Nagar Covid Hospital, did not respond to repeated calls for comments over the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-doctors-staff-of-women-s-hospital-in-quarantine-after-30-year-old-woman-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-E6OZxZsc8YPRLk0Skmi6nJ.html
25-05-2020||Noida||Over two-thirds of the workforce of NSEZ units return to work||As many as 21,867 workers have returned to their jobs and another 9,000 are working from home as on May 24, after the government granted permission for resumption of commercial activities in special economic zones (SEZs) and export-oriented units (EOUs), during the third and fourth phases of the ongoing nationwide lockdown from May 6.The Noida Special Economic Zone (NSEZ) units initially weren’t very successful in bringing back their workforce in the first week of May as only 2,000 workers of the total strength of 45,000, could resume their work.SEZ development commissioner (north India) Lalit B Singhal said bringing back nearly 31,000 of the 45,000, which is over 68%, in less than three weeks was a major achievement. “These numbers indicate that even during the crisis caused by pandemic, the NSEZ units are providing economic support to 30,000-odd families. I am sure that if the situation improves, then our units will run with at full strength by mid-July,” he said.Singhal further said that apart from these 30,867 workers, as many as 83,000 others are also working from home as part of the IT units of NSEZ. “We have provided opportunity to young men and women of this region to work from home and support their families at this difficult juncture. Their services are also having a positive impact on export and creating more forex. To facilitate them, we had permitted companies to allow them to take laptops and desktops home. We have so far allowed around 45,000 laptops and desktops for them,” he said.The development commissioner also said units operating in 34 SEZs of this region, covering Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, have made exports of ₹70,800 crore in the fiscal 2019-20. “In the same fiscal, these SEZs generated 3.8 lakh direct employments, besides creating over 10 lakh indirect jobs. The nationwide lockdown caused by Covid-19 has halted the operation and growth. But since we have restarted slowly but steadily, we are sure to regain momentum within two months,” he said.Even units operating in NSEZ, are also hopeful of a quick revival. Ashish Pradhan, chief executive officer (CEO) of e-Shakti, a customised garment unit in NSEZ, said his company has already reached 50% of its pre-Covid capacity. “There were 1,430 staff members present on the eve of the lockdown. When we recommenced on May 7, we had about 200 employees back on the first day, which reached 724 on Saturday. I am expecting it to be over 875 (61% of our capacity) before the month is over. Since increasing manpower to optimum level is difficult, as factories have been asked to follow social distancing norms strictly, we will ask for more space in the NSEZ to overcome this problem,” he said.Echoing similar views, Ajay Goel, president of NSEZ entrepreneurs’ association, said the quick turnaround has brought a lot of positivity and optimism to workers. “The lockdown will cause a loss of around 10% revenue this financial year. But, as our workers have started coming back to work and China is all set to face the crisis in the long run, we are all set to grow at 20% the coming financial year. Our workers are mostly migrants from Bihar and UP. As the agriculture sector at this time of the year does not provide occupation for many, they have started expressing an interest to return to work. Due to unavailability of transport, workers from Bihar are finding it more difficult to return as compared to their UP counterparts,” he said.Anticipating things to be normalised by July-end, another NSEZ entrepreneur Tarun Matreja of Usha Fabs Private Limited said that due to lockdown, the NSEZ units could not fulfil the pending orders within the promised delivery period of 9-13 days. “However, we remained in constant touch with our customers informing them about delay in their orders. We are deeply grateful to thousands of our customers who chose to wait and not cancel orders. Now, we have shipped out more than 80% of these delayed orders,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/over-two-thirds-of-the-workforce-of-nsez-units-return-to-work/story-iTXjHkwRIdEjBl6vN8XLML.html

He was detained and questioned, after which he confessed to the crime, the police said.“The boy knew the victim for the past year and a half, and was under the impression that Sharma would have at least a few thousands (of rupees) on him. On the night of the incident, he assaulted him but when the victim resisted, he attacked him with a knife and bricks, causing his death,” said Rajesh Kumar Singh, the deputy commissioner of police, Zone 3.On the day of the incident, the victim had ₹50 on him, which was taken by the boy.

25-05-2020||City||Acting principals of Delhi College of Arts, Sri Aurbindo (evening) divested of charge||New Delhi: The Delhi University administration Sunday night repatriated the officiating principals of Delhi College of Arts and Commerce (DCAC) and Sri Aurobindo College (evening) back to their parent college, the Sri Aurobindo College (morning). As per the provisions of the Ordinance XVIII 3(C) of the University, an officer on special duty (OSD) is ordinarily appointed for a period of six months as officiating principal of a college, if and when the need arises. The term can be extended with the prior approval of the vice-chancellor.“Rajiv Chopra, appointed as OSD for DCAC on October 1, 2013, has completed more than six years as OSD. I am directed to inform that Rajiv Chopra may be repatriated back to his parent college with immediate effect,” DU’s deputy registrar (colleges) wrote in a letter to the University Representative of DCAC.“The chairperson/university representatives of the governing body of the college is requested to temporarily hand over the charge of principal to the most senior teacher of the college, who fulfils the minimum eligibility requirements for appointment as principal,” the letter added.Chopra said he was unaware of the reason as to why he was “suddenly” repatriated back to his parent college from the post of officiating principal. “I have no idea why the university administration has made this decision overnight. I have been serving DCAC since 2013 as officiating principal and was later selected as the principal, but the matter was taken to the court and it is still sub judice,” he said.Namita Rajput, who has been serving as OSD at Sri Aurobindo College (evening) for three years, has also been repatriated to her parent college, the Sri Aurobindo College (morning). “We got a letter from the university representative. Ordinarily, OSDs are appointed for six months or till a permanent appointment is made, whichever is earlier. Their term can be extended. I completed three years at SAC (evening) in April as officiating principal and have been repatriated to my parent college with immediate effect,” Rajput said.Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) president Rajib Ray questioned the timing of the letters. “OSDs should be there for six months and that time period in both cases has elapsed multiple times. The repatriation letter also has glaring errors like addressing OSDs as principals. This should be rectified and a complete governing body of the college concerned should take appropriate action.”A senior university official said the decision was taken because both principals had completed their terms as officiating principals. “The tenure of officiating principals is six months. Both the principals have competed their terms a long time ago. There is nothing controversial about the decision,” the official said. Despite several attempts, DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi did not respond to calls and messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/acting-principals-of-delhi-college-of-arts-sri-aurbindo-evening-divested-of-charge/story-mUhFRM7rRnw7gzYQBPlvsL.html
25-05-2020||Delhi||AAP’s Sanjay Singh and BJP trade barbs on Tiwari playing cricket in Haryana||Aam Aadmi Party leader (AAP) and Rajya Sabha member of Parliament Sanjay Singh criticised the Delhi chief of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Manoj Tiwari, MP from North East Delhi, for playing cricket in Sonepat of Haryana in violation of the lockdown norms.Calling it an “insensitive act”, Singh said that the BJP MP is busy playing cricket when thousands of poor migrant labourers are walking back to their homes every day.Singh said, “But ignoring such a humanitarian crisis how can an elected public representative go to another state to play cricket? How can a public representative be so much insensitive?”The AAP leader also trained his guns at the BJP-led Haryana government, which, earlier this month, had banned the entry of even essential service providers. “The BJP-ruled (Manohar Lal) Khattar government stopping doctors or nurses, who work in Delhi but live in Haryana. The COVID warriors are being stopped and the BJP government has closed all the roads which are connecting Delhi and Haryana…But they don’t stop BJP MP Tiwari who had gone there to play cricket. This shows how insensitive the BJP is and how much hatred they have against the poor people,” Singh said.Tiwari hit back, saying the AAP is making an issue out of nothing. “I had permission to travel to the district in Haryana. The Centre has allowed sports activity in lockdown 4.0. There were no spectators and I ensured social distancing,” said Tiwari.Neelkant Bakshi, Delhi BJP’s media in-charge, said, “He had gone to meet someone in Gannaur with prior permission. On the request of a private stadium owner, he played there. He is the one who is on the ground since lockdown started helping and feeding the needy, which the AAP leaders have failed to do so.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-s-sanjay-singh-and-bjp-trade-barbs-on-tiwari-playing-cricket-in-haryana/story-oVdTtastSS5PUfJMXPwejK.html

I will recommend that alternative ways such as direct sowing and bed planting of rice should be opted.”‘MAKE USE OF WEEDICIDES IN CROPS’He said that farmers opting for bed planting and direct sowing of rice (DSR) technology should remain alert about the weed and use weedicides as recommended by the agricultural university. “Such weedicides can be sprayed through super seeder or lucky seeder machines, while sowing the crop,” the V-C said, adding that DSR technique is not recommended for light soil, but provides encouraging results in heavy and moderately heavy soil areas. V-C Dhillon also rubbished social media rumours that claim that the university was against the new technologies. “The university had given nod to bed planting of rice in 2007 and the technique of direct sowing of rice was given a nod in 2010,” he said, adding that a crop should be sown when there is enough moisture in the soil and air, and the field should be watered only after 21 days of sowing.The agricultural expert also said that the farmers who have never done direct sowing of rice should stick to the conventional method and use the new technology on one-fourth of the land on an experimental basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/use-less-labour-intensive-alternatives-in-paddy-sowing-pau-to-farmers/story-QqT93LBfYG1KeYfU5TICaI.html

25-05-2020||Gurugram||Students clean cars to raise funds for underprivileged||Over 30 teenage residents of The Ivy condominium in Sushant Lok-1 have joined hands to raise funds for underprivileged people during the lockdown by cleaning cars of the occupants.The young residents, who have formed a group called Santa Brigade, step out around 6am and clean at least 10 cars in the condominium every day in return for money to buy groceries, fruits, vegetables, sanitisers and mask for the needy in their area.The brigade members said they have been able to collect ₹15,000 over the last three weeks. The car owners pay them anything between ₹200 and ₹1000 for a wash, they said.After the lockdown was imposed, the residents’ welfare association (RWA) of the condominium decided to engage only essential staff. Car cleaners were asked to resume work only after May 31. This gave the Santa Brigade an opportunity. Rannveir Malik (14), co-leader of the Santa Brigade, said that his elder brother college-going Siddhant (19), started the group on May 1. “Today we are a team of more than 30 students and we have already started to do some meaningful and satisfying work to help the needy by providing ration, vegetables, face masks, hand sanitisers, clothes and milk to people in need. We are collecting money and buying daily needs items for the needy,” he said. Muskaan Grover, a 17-year-old class 12 student, said that the initiative it made her realise the actual worth of money and hard work. “It felt good to serve those in need, especially in such difficult times. Such times call for unity and seeing everyone come together made me feel like there’s hope. We get up early morning and collectively wash cars, and with the donation we help the underprivileged people,” she said.Fondly called reindeers and elves (just like Santa’s team) by the RWA members, the group members are aged between 13 and 17 years. They used their pocket money to buy car-cleaning soft cloth and detergent. In their support, the RWA provides them water and space.The group has also helped a tailor who used to sit outside the condominium but was out of work because of the lockdown. The students now gets him to stitch masks to distribute them to the people in slums. “We provide the raw material and the tailor stitches nearly 100 masks every day and is paid ₹500 daily,” said Nihal Grover, another student.Vijay Chopra, RWA president, said that as a community they take pride in the heartwarming initiative of their children in condominium and are supporting them in the noble cause. “These children are literally sweating it out to raise funds for Santa Brigade. I am glad that the youngsters have come out of their comfort zone to reach out to the needy. I am sure the current times have taught them to be more grateful for all the help they have at home and also not take life and privileges for granted. We are proud of them and happy to support them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/students-clean-cars-to-raise-funds-for-underprivileged/story-fOEpsgnRHAv5dkdYY8d8rJ.html
25-05-2020||Gurugram||Private hospitals cannot deny treatment to Covid-19 patients: Gurugram administration||The district administration on Monday issued an order making it mandatory for all private hospitals and nursing homes to treat Covid-19 patients who require critical health services. No private hospital in the city can refuse admitting a Covid-19 patient, who is already undergoing treatment for other health issues. Instances have been reported where patients have been denied treatment after they tested positive for Covid-19. The district has so far witnessed 284 cases of the virus.Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, issued an order on Monday stating that private hospitals or nursing homes in Gurugram shall not refuse any patient approaching them for treatment of Covid-19 and other critical services. The order reads, “In the recent past it has come to notice that some private facilities are refusing to treat patients with symptoms of coronavirus and other critical services, which is a grave matter in times of such epidemic.” National capita Delhi has already directed all private hospitals to reserve 20% beds for Covid-19 patients.As per the order, if any hospital or nursing home refuses treatment to any patient, action will be taken against them under the Epidemic Act.Recently, a 25-year-old Covid-19 positive woman had to deliver her baby in Faridabad after a private hospital refused to admit her and Gurugram’s Civil Hospital turned her away for lack of facility for pregnant women who test positive for coronavirus. The health department, however, said that now they have converted its Sector 31 polyclinic as facility for Covid-19 pregnant women.Once a patient tests Covid-19 positive in private hospitals, almost 90% of the time they are referred to Civil Hospital, Sector 10. This often leaves them in a lurch, said Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer.“It has come to our notice that a person taking critical health services in a particular hospital, if detected with Covid-19, is immediately referred to the government hospital. Patients requiring special health treatment related to nephrology or cardiology cannot be left in a lurch even if they test positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus. It can prove to be detrimental to their health and even prove fatal.”A member of the Indian Medical Association member, who preferred anonymity, said, “Nursing homes are not equipped to tackle Covid-19 patients, especially they require critical care. Big hospitals having proper equipment and facilities should be considered.”Health officials said that private hospitals are referring out patients citing Medeor Hospital for critical Covid-19 patients. The 120-bed Medeor Hospital in Manesar is a designated Covid-19 hospital that was inaugurated this month for tertiary care. In Gurugram, 100-bed ESIC hospital and 30-bed Civil Hospital are admitting patients with Covid-19 symptoms. A few asymptomatic, especially male patients, are kept in Ssector 9 quarantine facility.As per the order, with rising cases of people infected with the virus, it is necessary to ensure optimum utilization of available resources, like private hospitals and nursing homes, for treatment of Covid-19 patient so as to ensure appropriate medical care is provided to all patients. Interestingly, the district administration this month had issued an order directing only six private hospitals of the city to keep 100 beds ready for Covid-19 patients.Despite all these arrangements, critical Covid-19 patients are shifted to PGIMS Rohtak. The city earlier this week reported two coronavirus deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/private-hospitals-cannot-deny-treatment-to-covid-19-patients-gurugram-administration/story-yQiIvHjabqPcPSs0HFBPBO.html
25-05-2020||Gurugram||Factory owners face 10-15% increase in expenses due to sanitisation measures||Members of the Udyog Vihar Chamber of Industries on Monday expressed concerns over a 10-15% escalation in operational costs brought on by the purchase of disinfectants, sanitisers, thermal screening devices, disinfectant tunnels and the other Covid-related expenses over the last month.The Haryana government’s standard operating procedure (SOP), issued on April 19, mandated these requirements for resuming operations of factories. The factory owners submitted affidavits, stating they would follow the guidelines, failing which they are liable to penalties, ranging up to the sealing of non-compliant units.Ashok Kohli, the president of the Udyog Vihar Chamber of Industries, said, “This is an additional expense that we are facing. The maintenance cost has escalated 10 to 15 per cent for every factory owner, as per a review of the maintenance expenses for the past one month. Even if lockdown ends by the end of the month, this additional expense will still be a liability and we will have to plan to adjust this expense in a suitable way.”In a meeting on Monday, factory owners said they are already facing losses due to the prolonged shutdown of factories and disruption of the supply chain.Manmohan Gaind, the president of Manesar Industry Welfare Association, said, “We are buying disinfectant chemicals in bulk. We bought hundreds of thermal scanning devices to check temperatures and many cartons of sanitisers. The total expense on all this, as per my calculation, amounted to roughly 20% of my monthly maintenance cost of factory premises. We have to comply with the guidelines, otherwise, my factory will be sealed. As this cost is mandatory, we are expending it from our profit margin. But currently, we are not making any profit at all after we resumed operations.”“We cannot increase the costs of products because we will lose our clients. We need to maintain patience and wait for the situation to stabilise once the Covid-19 fear is over and the pandemic is under control. Even after the government has allowed factories to restart, there are still many restrictions on the workers’ movement. We wish the government will do away with these restrictions,” said Praveen Yadav, the president of Gurgaon Udyog Association.The nationwide lockdown since March 25 forced factories to shut for a month and has currently led to a shortage of workers due to the exodus of migrant workers to their home states.“This is a critical phase for us. We cannot think of adjusting additional expenses by increasing product costs currently. We will take a call on it next month,” said Pawan Yadav, president of IMT Industrial Association, Manesar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/factory-owners-face-10-15-increase-in-expenses-due-to-sanitisation-measures/story-eiWRS37ktLI0tJb7sFCVRP.html

The state government had appointed Pramila Kumari as its chairperson in February this year, but it did not show any urgency to fill up the vacancies of members, superannuated early this month.A former member of the commission said that the chairperson alone was not empowered to take any decision without support of the members. As per the rules of BSCPCR’s constitution, the chairperson requires attendance of at least three out of the six members to take any decision.The BSCPCR hogged the media glare recently when its chairperson directed all private schools across the state to abstain from taking tuition fees, including transportation charge, for the months of March and April—the lockdown phase—when schools remain closed.“Technically, the direction was invalid, as it was taken without proper quorum of the commission. The quorum is complete only when at least four members, including the chairperson, is present in the meeting,” explained the former member, adding that the BSCPCR is also facing a major problem in executing its orders, as all the executive power is vested with the secretary, which is vacant since January.Chairperson Pramila Kumari said that the commission has requested the department to appoint a suitable person as the secretary of the commission to discharge the duty for the purpose it was constituted. “The post has fallen vacant in January on retirement of Kishori Paswan,” she said.Role of the commission assumes considerable significance during the phase of crises caused due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as children, mostly living under the government’s protection or otherwise need special care to fight the pandemic. “It has the power to supervise functioning of the shelter homes for children, remand homes and look after the interest of the children at large,” said another a child development project officer (CDPO), posted with the commission.Principal secretary of social welfare department, Atul Prasad, said, “The process for selection of members of the commission would also be expedited once the department resumes normal functioning. The panel headed by the departmental minister would recommend the panel of members to the chief minister for his final clearance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bihar-child-rights-commission-turns-toothless-body-as-govt-delays-appointments/story-knDZRI1w9UB5gKaJaoU0aL.html
25-05-2020||Gurugram||Road rage: Senior executive of retail outlet assaulted in Gurugram||A 42-year-old senior executive of a retail outlet was allegedly assaulted on Sunday by three men in a case of road rage in Sushant Lok-1, the police said. The victim sustained injuries to his face and arm, they added. The police said they arrested the three suspects from Wazirabad Sunday late night and they were produced before the district and sessions court in Gurugram on Monday and were granted bail.According to the police, the incident took place around 5pm when the victim, Anish Khanna, was driving towards DLF Phase 4. When Khanna reached Block C of Sushant Lok-1, a Scorpio SUV coming from the opposite side collided head-on with his Maruti Suzuki Ciaz car, the police said. The bumpers of both cars suffered minor damage, they added.“I was driving my car from Sushant Lok-1 towards a condominium in DLF Phase 4. As I exited gate 1 of Block C, a Scorpio Car coming from the HUDA Metro station side at a high speed suddenly turned towards the gate without giving an indication and hit my car,” said Khanna, a resident of Ardee City.According to the police, the man driving the SUV demanded money for the damage. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said, “The victim asked him to come along to the police station following which he started making phone calls. They both drove to the police station in their own cars. Meanwhile, the prime suspect, Dev Singh, called his two friends, Pradeep Prasad and Purshottam Prasad, who came on a motorbike,” he said.The police officers at the Sushant Lok police station advised them to visit Sector 43 police station as the alleged incident was out of their jurisdiction following which the two parties left the police station.“As we entered the Sushant Lok-1 gate, the Scorpio car, which had two people inside now, intercepted my way. One of the suspects was on the bike. They got down from their vehicles and attacked me and my car. One of them started smashing the windscreen and broke it, while the other man broke the rearview mirror and smashed the driver side window,” said Khanna. He added that he tried to protect his face as the suspects started hitting him while he was standing near the car.“I was bleeding severely from my right arm. I rushed to the emergency of a private hospital and got my treatment done. On my way back, I informed the police control room,” said Khanna.The police said the victim had provided the SUV’s registration number and they identified the three suspects, who are from Wazirabad, after checking the CCTV camera footage of the incident.A case was registered against the three suspects under sections 279 (rash driving), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 336 (act of endangering life), 341 (wrongful restraint), 427 (causing damage) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Sushant Lok police station on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/road-rage-senior-executive-of-retail-outlet-assaulted-in-gurugram/story-2aacIn4pgNGWHv0aoIFi3M.html

MC chief engineer Shailender Singh said the engineering branch had prepared three major agendas worth ₹155 crore — civic amenities for villages for ₹100 crore, road works due for 2020-21 fiscal for ₹45 crore, and ₹10 crore of development works for Manimajra. He said the road works already allotted last year had begun and will pick up pace soon. SPENDING FOR COVIDAnother agenda item is enlarging the scope of ward development funds in the wake of coronavirus pandemic. Ward 1 councillor Mahesh Inder Singh Sidhu said under ward development fund, a councillor can spend ₹80 lakh per year on his ward, but the spending is mostly on civic works. “In the meeting, we will raise the demand to broaden the scope of ward development fund by including pandemic-related expenses, with proper safeguards of course,” he said. Ward 25 councillor Jagtar Jagga said, “Instead of park swings or proper roads, people these days expect us to provide them masks and sanitisers, or to help them financially on priority. “A provision should be made in the councillor’s ward development funds on these lines,” he said. Notably, MC will also place agenda for buying 20,000 pieces of PPE kits worth ₹2 crore. “MC staff has been working aggressively in the containment zones. The tender to procure the PPE kits has already been floated, and 34 companies have applied for it. The agenda will be placed before the House for approval,” said an official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/155-cr-development-works-on-agenda-in-chandigarh-mc-house-meet/story-wjKjdrgkKc2fJUQHnFHUlL.html
25-05-2020||Gurugram||Volunteers conduct classes over the phone for children who lack access to internet, smartphones||A group of volunteers in the city are teaching government school children through one-on-one classes on a range of subjects, including mathematics, English and Hindi over the landline. These volunteers have taken up this initiative to make sure that children who are not able to access the internet or do not have a smart phone can still make use of the e-learning curriculum published by the state education department since April onwards. Shivnath Sharma, who works as a carpenter in Chakkarpur, said that had this initiative not been there then his kids would not have even touched books. “I have two small kids and both of them are being taught via phone by the volunteers. My wife is not educated and I can’t afford either a smart phone or a laptop. If the volunteers had not contacted us, then my kids would never have been able to study during the lockdown,” said Sharma. On April 16, to prevent the loss of academic sessions during Covid-19 lockdown, the Haryana government decided to teach students from classes 1-12 through various e-learning platforms. According to the school education department of government of Haryana, around 71% government school children in the city are availing e-learning initiative. According to an estimate, at least 29% of the students in the city are still not able to access online education. As such, these volunteers with the help of education department have zeroed down on such students and have started conducting classes over the phone. Viren Jain, a high school student in the city who founded the Volunteer for Change programme, put together a core team, involving two of his friends, Krishnav Verma and Aryan Chopra, and a host of other enthusiastic volunteers, who came up with the idea to teach government school kids over the phone. Following an approval from the directorate of education, Haryana, these volunteers have started working with three government schools in Gurugram. “During the lockdown period, for around a month, nothing really happened for government school children. Also when e-learning started, there were many students who didn’t have access to e-learning. So we came up with this concept to teach children through the phone,” said Jain. Today there are 200 volunteers who are a part of this project, which started in the first week of May.The district education department (DEO) of Gurugram, Indu Boken, said that this is a wonderful initiative undertaken by the volunteer group. “They are carrying out activity-based learning. Most of it is happening in the primary and the elementary sections. It’s really great for the children,” said Boken.However, volunteers say it has never been an easy ride for them. The first challenge was to strike the right chord with the children and win their trust so that they become friendly and share their difficulties.Rishabh Ratnu, who has been teaching a primary school kid, said, “The first few calls helped me to get comfortable with the student whom I was going to teach. The first thing she said was, “We have kept roza (fast). Have you also done so?” I politely replied: “I haven’t, but for you I can keep it.” Ratnu started teaching mathematics to the student, who belong to a primary class. He even made audio programmes for her to learn the concept of the subject well. Most of the volunteers take classes on the phone thrice in a week for around 40 minutes. Indrani Sen, a volunteer who has been teaching a government school student in the city said, “The class would normally be of 40 minutes or an hour depending on how well the student has understood the subject. I even ask my student to make worksheets and inform me if he fails to grasp a concept.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/volunteers-conduct-classes-over-the-phone-for-children-who-lack-access-to-internet-smartphones/story-qOxnzrZ4wUjf8WmssXxKlM.html
25-05-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram University to hold exams for final year students in July-August||The Gurugram University (GU) administration on Monday said physical examination for final year postgraduate students will be conducted in the second week of July or the first week of August. The university administration said it will also organise a 15-day crash course for students right before the exams . The exams will be held in batches of 30-40, they said.The university has been conducting online classes for the students amid the lockdown. The administration said nearly 80% of students have attended classes online, however, around 20% of students were not able to attend them either because of poor internet or due to no access to smartphones or laptops. Dr Markanday Ahuja, vice-chancellor of the university, said, “We know that there are a few students who were not able to attend e-classes. For such students, we will be conducting classes at Rao Tula Ram Model College for 15 days right before the exams.” Students said the 15-day crash course will benefit them. “We have been told that a committee has been set up and that a core group of teachers will decide how our examinations will be conducted. When the lockdown was enforced and our college was closed, our syllabus was not completed. The university held online classes, but not everyone has internet access. So, these 15 days crash course will be beneficial for us,” said Lakshi Bhardwaj, final year student, , MA English.GU teachers they will come out with a small summary of the entire syllabus and clear all doubts of students during the crash course. Dr Suchitra Vashisth, professor in the English department, GU, said, “We have already covered the syllabus through the online classes. So, we are going to focus on the important points and clear the doubts of students. We are also going to make a short summary of the entire syllabus. I believe that online classes can never replace physical classes.”First-year and second-year students, the university officials said, might have to take their exams in December. They added the duration of the exams might be reduced and the number of questions may be cut down. “We can conduct a physical examination for the entire university in shifts. We will have to make a few adjustments: change the exam duration, reduce the number of questions, and so on. Most of the question papers are already prepared, but if the current situation worsens, then most probably we will take the exams for first and second-year students in December,” said Ahuja. The VC has also said whenever the new session starts all vacations will be cut short to accommodate the classes which have been lost to the lockdown. “In the upcoming session, which will start once the lockdown is over, we will cut short the vacations. We have two months of vacation apart from the 15-day Dussehra break and a 15-day winter vacation every year. Adjustments in this 90-day period will be made in the upcoming session ” added Ahuja. The administration also said despite all the restraints, GU will add two new courses this year — Masters in Physiotherapy and Masters in Pharmaceutical Science. “The government has also asked us to curtail expenditure as far new initiatives are concerned. These two courses won’t cost us much because we will be adding them to the existing departments and we have the infrastructure available already,” added Ahuja. However, the university doesn’t plan to add any new seats and the administration expects the admission process is to go on till October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-university-to-hold-exams-for-final-year-students-in-july-august/story-WSQ3NRQrs5p6UBNdWpmSmL.html
25-05-2020||City||Gurugram: With no support in their home towns, many migrants stay back||GurugramThousands of migrant workers have left Gurugram for their home states as their source of income dried up due to the Covid-19 lockdown. However, many migrant families have stayed back as they do not have any family support, alternative source of income or their own house in their home towns. Now, such migrants are dependent on the supply of free ration by the district administration or forced to take loans in order to buy groceries.“Hum ko to ab yehi rehena hai. Ghar par kuch nahi rakha hai (We will have to live here only. Our home town does not have any resources),” Kamala, a migrant worker from Madhya Pradesh, said while standing outside her shanty at Kanhai village in Sector 45. Unlike hundreds of migrant workers who left their shanties in the area, Kamala did not leave Gurugram for her native state after the lockdown. For the past two months, Kamala and her husband have been living on sporadic supply of free ration from the district administration and borrowing groceries from the local shops.“We stayed back because there is nothing for us in our home town. We had a house there which was destroyed during a storm and was never rebuilt. We do not even have a ration card there. In our home town, we will die due to starvation. Here, I can at least borrow some money and groceries to survive,” said Kamala, who works as domestic help at four houses in Sector 45.In a rapid survey of 100 migrant workers done by Safe in India Foundation (SII) and Agrasar (both Gurugram-based organisations working for workers) earlier this month, it was found that 76% of the workers did not receive their salary for April and 86% of those, who have stayed back, want to go back to the same company after the lockdown.At another patch of shanties in Kanhai village, Sripath Kharwar and his family are the only ones left behind. On Saturday afternoon, there was an eerie silence in the area, punctured only by the sounds of passing by vehicles. Several auto-rickshaws belonging to migrant workers who left were parked in front of the vacant shanties. “My children are alone as other families have left. But those people had something or someone to go back to. Where should I go now?” said Kharwar, a daily wager from Madhya Pradesh. On May 21, he was offered work for just two days at a construction site nearby and earned Rs 800 for each day’s labour.“Currently, we are surviving on whatever work I was offered. I do not even know if I will get any work tomorrow. I owe around Rs 20,000 to grocery shop owners and other people,” Kharwar said while alleging that the administration did not provide free ration on a regular basis. His two children, seven-year-old daughter and four-year-old son, had to drop out of a private school just before the lockdown due to lack of money.However, Vivek Kalia, estate officer-II, Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran, denied the allegation. “We are still providing food at the community centres. The migrant workers can go there and collect it. The verification of free ration forms is still underway. As soon as it gets completed, ration will be distributed among the migrant workers. Many of them have already received the supply,” said Kalia, who is also the nodal officer for food distribution in the district.At Silokhera village, South City-1, most of the migrant families from West Bengal have stayed back. Without any source of income and occasional supply of free ration, the families are facing a financial crisis and most of them are debt ridden.“No government officials provided us any special train or bus to go to West Bengal. The private agents are demanding Rs 5,000 for each passenger, which I can’t afford as I have four persons in my family. Though my other family members live in Malda, I cannot afford to return,” said Shakir-ul Ali, who stays in a rented room in Silokhera village. He has been a resident of Gurugram for more than four years and works as auto-rickshaw driver. “I now owe around Rs 15,000 to my friends and other grocery shop owners. I have to pay around Rs 4,500 every month, as my landlord has refused to let me stay here without paying rent,” Ali added. The officials said that trains and buses are being arranged for all the migrant workers who want to return to their native states. Mahesh, station house officer (SHO), Sector 40 police station, said, “Recently, migrant workers from North-east states were sent home. Police personnel in our jurisdiction are going around and asking the migrant workers to be registered for the journey. All those who are from West Bengal will also be ferried to their home as soon as buses and trains are arranged for them.” Regarding the alleged harassment by the landlords on pretext of rent, the SHO said that whenever such an incident was reported, the police have taken necessary steps against the suspects. In April, the Haryana government had issued directions stating that landlords should not demand house rent for a month from migrant workers, students and paramedics in rural areas of the state. As per the order, if any landlord is found forcing such tenants to vacate, they would be liable for strict criminal action.However, the only silver living for such migrant workers is the recent ease in lockdown restriction. As work at construction sites has resumed and cabs and auto-rickshaws have been allowed to run, such migrant workers hope they will gradually find some job and would be able to sustain their families.Nand Kishore, a migrant worker from Uttar Pradesh, stays in South City-1 with his family and younger brother. He works as auto-rickshaw driver and is also attached with a cab aggregator in the city. Kishore said that he had to borrow around Rs 25,000 to survive. However, for the past one week, things have improved for him. “Since last Sunday, I have been driving around my auto-rickshaw. The business is not that good but I earn enough money to survive. It has been more than two decades since I came to this city. Things would have been worse if I had chosen to return to my home town. Nobody even remembers me there,” Kishore added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-with-no-support-in-their-home-towns-many-migrants-stay-back/story-g9n9Ruh4aI0eJJM7X73wnI.html

Doctors advised him to come for a review after a week, and then the lockdown was announced and I was stranded in Mumbai,” said Nag.Nag made three attempts to return, but each time lockdown was extended and flights did not operate.“I booked my tickets thrice — April 7, April 15 and May 4 — but each time I could not travel because the lockdown was extended. Though I was staying with my aunt in Mumbai, I was desperate to return home and even arranged for movement pass by road when the government announced lifting of the embargo on domestic flights,” said Nag.The uncertainty over flight operations from Mumbai till late Sunday evening did not help his cause.“I was constantly watching the news last evening… I lost 14 kg after surgery and still feel weak, but I had no option as I reached the airport three-and-a-half hours before the scheduled departure,” he said.“Even today, I was not sure whether my flight will operate when I reached Terminal-2 of the Mumbai airport, as around 50 flights were cancelled from Mumbai,” said Nag, feeling much relieved to have returned home at Gaighat in Patna City.Ten flights — five of SpiceJet, four of IndiGo and one of Air India — had operated from the Patna airport till 5pm on Monday, as domestic flights operation commenced after two months since the lockdown on March 25. One flight of IndiGo was scheduled to operate at 7pm, said Patna airport director BCH Negi.“We had 1,424 incoming passengers and 724 outgoing passengers by 10 flights. GoAir will resume operations from June 1.Nag was appreciative of efforts to maintain social distancing inside terminal building of both Mumbai and Patna airports, but said there were no such restrictions outside. He also said there was no one to take the health declaration (on coronavirus symptoms) either at Patna or Mumbai airports.“We were checked by infrared thermometers both at Mumbai and Patna airports. Officials checked our status on the Aarogya Setu mobile app, but there was to ask us to fill our health declaration form,” Nag signed out.TAKING OFF11 flights operated from Patna airport on MondayFive departures each of IndiGo and SpiecJet; and one of Air IndiaThere were 1,424 incoming passengers and 724 outgoing passengers by 10 flights till 5pm on MondayDGCA has approved 17 daily scheduled flight departures from Patna airport as per calibrated flight operations due to Covid-19GoAir will commence flight operations from June 1Vistara will re-start operations from Patna from June 15||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/stuck-in-mumbai-for-2-months-cancer-patient-from-patna-flies-home/story-M7jHedJEogrFDGEEVq7cuL.html

The accused are Surjit Singh of Chabhal village, Tarlok Singh of Chappa village and Amar Singh of Chhina Bidhi Chand village. The case has been registered on the complaint of Pungrain inspector Gurpreet Singh, who was deployed as an investigator at Baba Deep Singh rice mill in Chappa village where the Pungrain had stored its paddy. “On being suspicious about the stored paddy in the mill, I, along with other employees of the department, conducted an inspection on May 20. We found that more than 1.9 lakh bags (each containing 37.5 kg) of paddy were missing. The value of the missing bags has been pegged at Rs 1.25 crore,” he said. He said when he further investigated the matter, it came to the fore that the three partners had stolen the paddy during the lockdown period. “Our investigation revealed that the trio took away the paddy taking advantage of the lockdown,” he added.

25-05-2020||Chandigarh||Water supply disruption leaves Chandigarh residents high and dry||Water supply in Chandigarh was disrupted due to maintenance work on Monday, leaving residents at the receiving end. Many residents said they hadn’t been getting enough water for around a week now, and the authorities were failing to act on it. The pumping of raw water from Kajauli to Chandigarh was stopped due to an emergency shutdown by the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) for erecting a tower on the Kharar-Mohali power line. Municipal corporation (MC) officials said the work will stop on Tuesday but it might take till Wednesday for the supply to normalise.Even on Monday, while residents were assured of normal water supply at least in the morning, many said it started by around 7am, instead of 4am, and went out by 9am. President of the Sector 41A LIG Duplex residents’ welfare association (RWA) Vijay Chikarsal said, “The water supply was delayed and the pressure was so low that our overhead tank did not fill up.” However, the water woes for Sector 41A have been continuing for about a week now. Chikarsal said he had even written to their local area councillor, Hardeep Singh, asking that the water pressure be improved but to no avail.Jyoti Bhardwaj, a resident of Sector 47, said they had been facing water problems throughout this month. “After we kept asking the MC officials to fix it, the water supply was restored for about ten days, but now again we are facing an issue,” he said. General secretary of the Sector 33B RWA, Kuljinder Singh Sra, said the supply had been erratic this month and often could not even reach the first and second floors of their houses.Chandigarh Resident Associations Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) has also written to the MC commissioner KK Yadav about this. Chairman Hitesh Puri said that CRAWFED members will approach the commissioner regarding this on Tuesday. MC officials tasked with supplying water to the city said they hadn’t received any complaints from these areas. “There is no problem from the supply side. Maybe some local-level faults could be causing a hindrance which we will get checked,” they said, adding that the use of unauthorised pumps on the main water supply can also lead to such problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/water-supply-disruption-leaves-chandigarh-residents-high-and-dry/story-WGkSYBxi3Ck9wRCxjXcvhJ.html

25-05-2020||Chandigarh||Capt now meets Manpreet, Channi, deadlock over chief secy continues||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh met his ministerial colleagues Manpreet Singh Badal and Charanjit Singh Channi on Monday, but could not break the deadlock over their demand for removal of chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh. The meeting between Amarinder and the two senior ministers, who were the first to seek the 1984-batch IAS officer’s removal from the top bureaucratic position, took place at a lunch hosted by the chief minister at his farmhouse in Siswan village near Chandigarh. Besides finance minister Manpreet Badal and technical education minister Channi, sports and youth affairs minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi and Congress MP Manish Tewari also attended the luncheon meeting.The deadlock over the chief secretary’s removal came up for discussion expectedly, but both Manpreet Badal and Channi suggested to the chief minister to call a meeting of the state cabinet and discuss the issue with all members. The much-awaited meeting ended without any forward movement on the issue. When contacted, Manpreet Badal, whose father had passed away recently, confirmed the meeting, stating that on reaching Chandigarh after the 10-day mourning period, he got a message that the chief minister wanted to meet him to offer his condolences personally. “The chief minister invited me to his residence. I got to know that he (Amarinder) wanted to call the chief secretary also, but I requested him not to do so and the CM was gracious enough not to invite the officer,” he said. The finance minister said a range of issues, including the state finances, capital expenditure and Covid-19 management measures, were discussed. “The chief secretary issue also came up as the chief minister wanted to know how to move forward on it. But I suggested to him that since this (chief secretary’s removal) was a unanimous decision of the state cabinet, why doesn’t he call a cabinet meeting and ask what to do. This was my considered view,” he said, confirming that Channi also agreed with him.The unprecedented row between the chief secretary and senior cabinet ministers had started when they had a showdown over the proposed changes in the excise policy at a pre-cabinet meeting on May 9 amid the Covid-19 lockdown. The ministers, led by Manpreet Badal and Channi, got upset over the chief secretary’s demeanour and behaviour towards them and walked out of the meeting. At the cabinet meeting two days later, the ministers ‘unanimously’ gave an ultimatum to the chief minister to sack Karan Avtar or they would not attend meetings as long as he was there.Amarinder later divested the officer of the charge of financial commissioner, taxation, but this failed to placate the ministers. Monday’s luncheon meeting was the first between Amarinder and his two ministers since. As a part of his efforts to break the deadlock, the chief minister had last week also hosted a lunch for Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar, cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and MLAs Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Pargat Singh and Sangat Singh Gilzian. All five had earlier vociferously sought the officer’s removal and a probe into the excise revenue losses, demands which they reiterated during the last week’s meet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/capt-now-meets-manpreet-channi-deadlock-over-chief-secy-continues/story-sJKxtjdFkv2QPbOxrB84FK.html

25-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab’s first hotspot SBS Nagar is Covid-free again||Punjab’s first Covid-19 hotspot Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar was declared virus-free again on Monday as two remaining patients were discharged after having recovered from the disease, in what officials say was a result of strict containment measures and surveillance on those coming from outside the district. The district also became containment zone-free as restrictions were lifted from its last contained village Gunachaur. “The curbs imposed on the village were removed as per the revised guidelines of the Union health ministry for containment zones. The two remaining patients were discharged from the isolation ward of Guru Nanak Mission Charitable Hospital, Dhahan Kaleran,” deputy commissioner Vinay Bublani said. The virus outbreak took place in the district in March when it reported 18 back-to-back cases, including one death. Fourteen family members of the deceased, Baldev Singh, a Sikh preacher who returned from Germany via Italy, were also infected. But the district, which was counted among 10 Covid-19 hotspots in the country, did not report a single positive case between March 26 and April 24. It was on April 22 that SBS Nagar was declared as Covid-free. Three days later, a Jammu-returned Balachaur village youth, who returned from Jammu, tested positive. Later, at least 75 persons who returned from Takht Hazur Sahib Maharashtra’s Nanded, were found infected besides 10 cases with travel history. Civil Surgeon Dr Rajinder Bhatia said, “We have treated 101 patients from SBS Nagar and 11 from other districts who were found positive here.”“Strict enforcement of norms in containment zones was the key in curbing the spread of the virus. We conducted maximum sampling of the suspected patients or close contacts of those found infected. More than 2,100 people have been tested till date. As many as 24 villages, including 15 of Banga sub-division alone, were sealed,” Bublani said. Additional deputy commissioner Aditya Uppal said, “We have three-tier surveillance system up to the village level to monitor the residents, especially those coming from outside the district or the state. Our ASHA and ANM workers monitoring people on the ground are assisted by 13 rapid response teams which are further supervised by senior medical officers.” At least 10 such people who were tested positive were traced in their villagesby these workers, said Uppal. “A 25-year-old Balachaur youth secretly entered the district on April 21 night. He was detected the next day due to strong surveillance and his sample was collected,” he added. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Deepika Singh, Covid-19 nodal officer, said they have launched a portal ‘Stop Covid’ to gather data of those coming from outside the district or Punjab and ensure they are kept in institutional quarantine with the health department’s help. “We have set up 14 inter-district checkpoints where our medical teams conduct check-ups of travellers,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-s-first-hotspot-sbs-nagar-is-covid-free-again/story-QwyTxQC2m6CvDmedm25RnK.html

Chandumajra, who along with a five-member delegation walked from Anandpur Sahib to SBS Nagar as part of the ‘Insaaf March’, said an attempt by the Punjab Police to close the case as that of robbery was nothing but a “childish cover-up” to protect the real culprits.Later, they submitted a memorandum to the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district deputy commissioner in this regard. “If it was a case of robbery, how come the robbers left behind their motorcycle? People and the victim’s family members want to know the real truth and motive behind the murder. Illegal sand mining is going on with impunity under political patronage of Congress leaders,” he said.The Capt Amarinder Singh-led government misled people by promising to end illegal sand mining in a time-bound manner, he added.

25-05-2020||Mumbai||Wadala GSB mandal cancels Ganpati celebrations due to coronavirus||This year’s Ganeshotsav celebrations may be muted because of the Covid-19 pandemic. On Monday, one of the richest Ganpati mandals in the city, Goud Saraswat Brahmin Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samiti of Wadala,  announced its decision to postpone its Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations to February 2021 due to the outbreak of Covid-19. Other mandals said they intend to go ahead with their plans for Ganesh Chaturthi, which is on August 22.  Popularly known as GSB Wadala, the mandal’s 10-day Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations are extremely popular. Ulhas Kamat, president of the mandal, said “We have lakhs of people visiting our pandal. With the guidelines that are in place, we know it will be difficult to manage the crowds.” Social distancing norms defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) require people to maintain a distance of at least 6 feet between one another. “So, for the safety of everyone, we have decided that celebrations will be held during Maghi Ganpati,” said Kamat. Maghi Ganesh Chaturthi will begin on February 15, 2021.  The 66-year-old GSB Wadala is considered one of the richest mandals in the city and sees a footfall of 8,000 devotees per day.“We will begin preparations for Ganeshotsav in November,” said Kamat, adding that the mandal also intended to have its regular Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations in 2021. Other mandals in the city said they intend to go ahead with the festivities in August. “We haven’t heard of any other Ganpati mandal deciding on postponement or cancellation of celebrations except GSB Wadala as of now,” said Naresh Dahibhavkar, Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti (BSGSS), the umbrella body of Ganpati mandals in the city.RG Bhatt, trustee of Goud Saraswat Brahmin (GSB) Seva Mandal, King’s Circle, said, “A Ganpati with a long legacy cannot just be postponed like this because that will mean a gap of a year, which religiously cannot be permitted. We will speak to the chief minister and decide on guidelines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/wadala-gsb-mandal-cancels-ganpati-celebrations-due-to-coronavirus/story-i69lXuktL1efepNqywy8OK.html

The Delhi government’s advertisement for recruitment of civil defence volunteers had stoked a controversy as it incorrectly referred to the people of Sikkim as a separate category from Indian citizens. Though the AAP said it was an error by an official who had been suspended, Jakhar tweeted: “Claim of being a mistake is belied as AAP patronised terrorists and separatists during Punjab assembly election ’17 also (sic)”.At a press conference in Chandigarh, Cheema accused the state Congress chief of making the “unfortunate” remarks to hide his own failures and that of the Congress government in Punjab at a time when the entire country is combating the coronavirus. “Jakhar is merely trying to regain the lost political ground after he lost elections in different parts of the state. If there was any truth in his allegations, what was the Congress government doing for three-and-a-half years? Why it did not take any action?” he asked.“What about numerous faux pas by the deputy commissioners and a minister that left many people embarrassed and hurt the Sikh sentiments in Punjab. Jakhar used to hold two press conferences every week to speak out against mafias during the previous Akali regime, but is maintaining total silence now as all those activities were still going on under the Congress government,” Cheema claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/aap-asks-punjab-cong-pres-to-apologise-for-remarks-or-face-state-wide-protest/story-KfFYdY5dlrZsga94CN39EI.html
25-05-2020||Mumbai||Over 70% urban professionals willing to working from home post lockdown: Survey||A survey conducted with 1,082 urban professionals across 10 Indian cities has found that 80% believe that working from home (WFH) will have a positive impact on air quality while 70% said they were willing to continue WFH even after the lockdown ends.The clampdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic over two months now resulted in several professionals forced to WFH to ensure the spread of Sars-Cov-2 virus could be contained.Conducted by Delhi-based communications initiative, Climate Trends, along with market research company YouGov, the survey was carried out online between April 26 and May 7 across - Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Pune and Surat. Each of the 10 cities accounted for 10% each of the sample size.Results from Mumbai showed nearly 95% respondents said they were directly impacted by air pollution, and 69% were willing to work from home as it may lead to cleaner air and less traffic. Over 71% wanted to WFH to avoid crowded places and shared mobility. Additionally, 47% respondents said they were willing to buy affordable electric vehicles provided there was the availability of charging infrastructure. While 65% preferred to walk shorter distances, 52% Mumbai respondents would still consider public transport options more often. “Mumbai had the highest number of respondents that said they were personally impacted by air pollution as one of the primary reasons for opting for WFH even after lockdown. If people are willing to avoid crowded places, governments, policymakers, and employers may now need to look at a structured WFH practice in a phased manner with equal or more productivity than the office space,” said Aarti Khosla, director, Climate Trends.“Not just employees but the trend showed nine of 10 employers think that their company has saved on operational costs since employees began WFH provided availability of proper work infrastructure and increased productivity by cutting down on commute time,” added Khosla.Pan-India results showed 90% respondents thought air pollution impacts them personally with nearly one in two respondents indicating that they suffer from pollution-related ailments.Sudhir Srivastava, chairman, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board said, “Organisations today have adapted to the current abnormal situation through WFH, and some many continue with this concept once the crisis is over. As a result, the commute will be less and may have a positive effect on air quality. However, public transport may see a setback in the coming days. It is an evolving situation, and changes are being carefully monitored.”The survey results drew a mixed response from city-based urban planners and experts citing a small sample size and practical feasibility of WFH for those citizens whose work needed them to step out irrespective of their choices. “Everyone cannot work from home as there are certain professions who have to go to the field. There is a need for graded evaluation for which kinds of professionals can transition to WFH completely, which is happening in international cities,” said Pankaj Joshi, director, Urban Design Research Institute. “However, we must realise that we are talking of an extremely small percentage of society. Only 8% of India has broadband access, and we need to be sensitive to how this pandemic will shape other sectors, especially agricultural and working class that cannot fathom such options.” WFH is a large global experiment currently underway, said, researchers. “If we can nail it right, the benefits will be across several levels of our society from improved productivity, to improved family interactions and cleaner liveable cities,” said Navroz Dubash, professor, Centre for Policy Research.Transport planner Vivek Pai said, “Complete WFH is possible for not more than 25% professionals. The survey results might be an immediate reaction to the current fear of the pandemic, which is driving such recommendations. We will have to see how the situation changes over the next six months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/over-70-urban-professionals-willing-to-working-from-home-post-lockdown-survey/story-R5LF3bi5xFM3gcw5FD9CIM.html

25-05-2020||Delhi||Action being taken against fair price shops that stay shut, despite orders: Delhi government tells high court||The Delhi government has informed the Delhi High Court that it has issued warnings and imposed penalties on the license holders of fair price shops (FPS) after complaints were received against them for keeping their shops shut..In a compliance report filed by the government, that additional standing counsel, Anuj Aggarwal, told the court that there have been some instances of sealing or suspension of shops due to alleged irregularities or in case of detection of Covid-19 positive cases resulting in the closure of shops, leading to the staggered supply of ration.Aggarwal added that in cases where action has been taken against the erring FPS licensee, appropriate linking and delinking of cards is made to a nearby alternate location, so that the beneficiaries are not inconvenienced and they are informed about the change.The report comes while hearing a plea by an NGO Rozi Roti Abhiyan Adhikar seeking implementation of the provisions of the National Food Security Act regarding the establishment of the Grievance Redressal Committee to address concerns of the public. On the last date of hearing, the court had expressed disappointment at the Delhi government’s inaction in providing ration to the poor, despite orders . It had asked the government to file a compliance report in this regard.The government, in the report, said that the ration shops are open throughout the week and instructions have been issued accordingly. It said on April 29, it was decided to open the Fair Price Shops for the distribution cycle of May in a staggered manner to ensure the convenience of beneficiaries and smooth distribution of ration while adhering to social distancing norms.“….as per the norms in place, with the closure of one distribution cycle under Public Distribution System (PDS), the other distribution cycle can be taken up by the FPS only after ‘opening of sales’, which requires inspection of availability of stocks in the FPS and maintenance of necessary registers .“Therefore, the process of ‘opening of sales’ by circle food supply inspectors and food supply officers was undertaken in a staggered manner. Accordingly, in view of the staggered opening of sales, only a limited number of FPS were allowed to be open for distribution,” the report said.The government also said that with respect to the complaints of the petitioner about the number of FPS shops closed, action as per rules is under process against erring shops . It said that directions have been issued to all the concerned authorities for compliance of opening of shops during working hours. It also said that 1,74,000 e-coupons have been issued to beneficiaries, who do not have an aadhaar card. It also said that 29.76 lakh non-PSD beneficiaries have been provided relief benefits from the Designated Distribution Centres.The matter would be now heard on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/action-being-taken-against-fair-price-shops-that-stay-shut-despite-orders-delhi-government-tells-high-court/story-gP83vozr43vShn21fPtfkJ.html

Complainant Brigadier Neeraj Kumar Soni, who lives in the Chandimandir cantonment, told the police that he bought the phone online on May 11 from a firm named 2GUD. The transaction of Rs 9,799 from his credit card was carried out in favour of Flipkart Internet Private Limited.The phone’s delivery was promised by May 16 initially, and later deferred to May 21. However, he didn’t receive the order by then.Brigadier Soni said he later received a call from a man identifying himself as the e-commerce firm’s representative. “He said they were unable to deliver the phone. So, I asked for a refund and he asked me to provide a Google Pay or Phone Pay account information to get the money back,” the complainant told the police.Brigadier Soni gave the caller his daughter’s Google Pay account details and sent back a message to the caller on a different mobile number, as asked by the latter. Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Rajbir Singh, the investigating officer, said the caller allegedly told the complainant to download a form from the link that was sent. However, he declined it immediately.Later, the complainant was asked to open the phone’s calculator and type the last four digits of his bank account.

An official said on anonymity that till date the civic body has distributed around 40,000 kits only.The opposition parties are blaming the ruling BJP, accusing the party of politics in ration kits distribution. The opposition claims preference has been given to the elected members from the Bhartiya Janata Party.According to the opposition party members, more kits are available in the areas where BJP members are representing but the main containment zones are getting fewer kits.Nationalist Congress party Parvati constituency president Nitin Kadam said, “I appealed to municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad and mayor Murlidhar Mohol to conduct an inquiry in kits distribution. For example the kits are distributed in Taljai slum on Saturday and Sunday but the 1 litre oil bag is missing from the kit. If PMC is paying money for the kits, the administration should ensure that the kit has all the elements which are promised.”NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena’s elected members criticised the kits distribution delay and said on anonymity that as the scheme is good, they did not want to bring politics in it but unfortunately the ruling BJP is doing politics over this issue.According to Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol, the main reason for the Covid-19 spread is that people from slum areas venture out to purchase essential items and another source is community toilets.“To control citizens’ movement in containment zones, PMC decided to give free ration kits. The door-to-door distribution of the kits will begin from Saturday. Each ration kit contains groceries worth Rs 800. These kits will have the PMC logo on it,” said Mohol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-fails-to-distribute-ration-kits-oppn-slams-bjp/story-8wzxf9ONLp32H0C5O5YaZI.html

25-05-2020||City||NCP chief Sharad Pawar meets Maharashtra governor||NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Monday met with Maharashtra Governor B S Koshyari at Raj Bhavan here.The NCP claimed that the meeting took place on the invitation of the governor and no political issues came up for discussion.Speaking to reporters after leaving Raj Bhavan, senior NCP leader Praful Patel said it was a courtesy meeting at the request of Koshyari.When asked whether Pawar and the governor discussed any political issues, Patel said, “It was a routine meeting between them. It was not about any particular political issue or topic”.However, the timing of the meeting is significant as it took place against the backdrop of strained relations between the Shiv Sena, which heads the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of which the NCP is one of the key constituents, and the Raj Bhavan.Pawar was one of the key leaders from Maharashtra who had openly complained about Koshyari’s “intervention” in the functioning of the state administration.Recently, the governor had taken a strong objection to a letter written by state Higher and Technical Education Minister Uday Samant to the University Grants Commission, recommending cancellation of final year university exams.In a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Koshyari had said that “not conducting the final year examinations by universities amounts to breach of UGC guidelines”. He also asked Thackeray to issue suitable instructions to Samant for his “unwarranted intervention”.Earlier in the day, an editorial published in the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ slammed the governor for being in favour of conducting final year university exams in the state, and said health of students cannot be put at risk amid the COVID- 19 crisis.The Sena had also expressed its displeasure with Raj Bhavan over “frequent meetings” between Opposition BJP and the governor. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis had recently complained to the governor about the “failure” of the Thackeray government in handling the Covid crisis.Last week, Thackeray, who heads the Sena, had skipped a meeting called by Koshyari to take stock of the situation.Earlier, the Sena had criticised Koshyari when he did not act on the Maharashtra Cabinet’s recommendation in April to nominate Uddhav Thackeray as member of the state Legislative Council from the governor’s quota.Thackeray was eventually elected unopposed to the Upper House earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-meets-maharashtra-governor/story-yjDXtt1QZhfRLlAmqlNMZO.html

The duo cited health issues and claimed that there are no proper facilities in the jail amid the Covid-19 outbreak. ED’s counsel, Hiten Venegaokar, objecting their plea argued that the Arthur Road jail is in the red zone, and thus no one is permitted to either enter or exit the prison premises. It was further submitted that it is not advisable to allow a prisoner to go out in society and put others at the risk of contamination. Venegaokar also argued that the high-power committee of the Bombay high court has barred interim bail for those accused in cases under PMLA.The special court, after hearing both the sides, rejected the plea of Wadhawans made for interim bail.The central agency initiated probe against the father and son after it came to light that the two obtained loans unlawfully from PMC Bank with the help of other bank officials. ED probed the money laundering allegations against the Wadhawans and listed 19 subsidiary companies of HDIL Group as accused, which allegedly were used by the Wadhawans to launder money. The duo had obtained the loans under the names of these companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pmc-bank-fraud-pmla-court-denies-interim-bail-to-rakesh-and-sarang-wadhawan/story-bG9yku0XhWryoxEEC1kJFK.html

Jammu police had arrested a suspect, also a minor, in the connection.After postmortem was conducted, the victim’s family carried the body to Satwari chowk on the national highway and staged a protest. The blockade of the chowk led to huge traffic jam, leaving vehicles stranded on all directions.The family alleged police inaction led to the murder of the minor. “Had the police acted in time, Ritik’s life could have been saved,” said his father.Another family member alleged that Ritik murder was a handiwork of the entire accused (suspect) family. “The murder was executed by entire family as Ritik’s face was disfigured with acid to conceal his identity. The murder does not seem to be a solo job. Now they (accused family) have cleverly shifted the entire blame on minor, knowing that being a minor he will soon go scot free,” he added.Meanwhile, Jammu senior superintendent of police (SSP) Shridhar Patil confirmed that the police had detained a suspect in the connection. On being asked about suspect’s involvement in Ritik’s murder, SSP said, “It will be premature to arrive at any conclusion now as the investigation is still underway.”Sources said the boy (suspect) with whom Ritik last talked on May 20, had been betting over online games. They said Ritik had lost bet and owed money to him.Meanwhile, traffic was resorted after over four hours, when senior police officers assured the victim’s family of fair probe. Thereafter, the family preformed the last rites of the deceased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jammu-minor-murder-alleging-police-inaction-kin-block-highway/story-XgBrF9rgtNk1TYpKIuDT5I.html

It is for the first time that the Haryana government has approved the proposal by CCSHAU to setup a government-aided organic certification agency. With HOCA, there will be no hurdle in marketing and export of organic produce from Haryana as the agency will also be equipped with a sophisticated testing laboratory for pesticide residue and nutritional testing,” Singh said.The university has got the society registration under the Haryana Registration and Regulation of Societies Act, 2012 and the V-C will be the ex-officio president and controlling officer of Deendayal Upadhyay Centre of Excellence for Organic Farming.Singh explained that there are two systems of organic certification. One is self-certification system (Participatory Guarantee Scheme) but it is not effective for export. The second is third party certification which is mostly adopted for export but involves higher cost. “The HOCA will help organic growers of Haryana obtain the third party certification in a cost effective and transparent manner that will enable them to sell their produce with certification mark in domestic as well as international market,” the V-C said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-govt-to-set-up-organic-certification-agency-at-agri-varsity/story-kOKONZ2YRYDHki0COX6zIL.html

25-05-2020||Mumbai||TISS releases exam results of students whose fees were pending||The Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai, on Monday released the results of the students whose final semester marks it had withheld over pending fees. While results were declared online late last week, many students- beneficiaries of the Government of India-Post-Matric Scholarship (GoI-PMS) - had complained that their results had been withheld. They said that the administration had not released their results as they hadn’t been able to pay their final year fees owing to a delay in disbursement of the scholarship funds from their respective state governments.A total of 1,252 students graduated from the institute’s over 70 programmes this year. Of these, 86 students are recipients of the GoI-PMS. Institute authorities claimed that owing to the lockdown and technical glitches, the results of students with dues could not be displayed. “We have cleared the process in the results portal. All those students who have paid the first-year fellowship to the institute have been cleared and can now access their results. Those who haven’t deposited the first-year fees have been informed to do so at the earliest to access their results,” said MP Balamurugan, deputy registrar of the institute.While the institute doesn’t charge a tuition fee from students coming from the Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBC) categories as well as economically weaker sections, it levies a dining hall and hostel charge. The total for four semesters for GoI-PMS comes to around Rs65,000, which they pay after receiving their scholarship from their respective state governments. However, amid a nationwide lockdown after the Covid-19 outbreak, many GoI-PMS students have not received their scholarship amounts from the state government and many have taken to fund raising attempts to be able to pay their fees. “We are aware that many of our students have to complete joining formalities and a large number of them are placed in the healthcare sector. The results of 31 out of 39 GoI-PMS students from Maharashtra have been cleared. From outside Maharashtra, there are 47 GoI-PMS students and we have released the results of seven of them. The rest will be able to see their results once they clear their first-year fees,” said Balamurugan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tiss-releases-exam-results-of-students-whose-fees-were-pending/story-BvIYLi3WVpTLkAIiHWh8gI.html

25-05-2020||Chandigarh||Hike of Rs 53 proposed as paddy MSP is peanuts, say farmers||The proposal of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) to increase minimum support prices (MSP) of kharif crops is “peanuts,” farmers in Punjab have said. “We reject the commission’s recommendations to offer peanuts by increasing paddy MSP by Rs 53 this year. They have taken such decisions while sitting in air-conditioned rooms without any reality check on the ground,” said Sukhdev Singh Kokari, general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan). According to the recommendations approved by the Union cabinet, the MSP of paddy (common) is Rs 1,868, an increase of Rs 53 from Rs 1,815 last year and paddy (Grade-A) is Rs 1,888 (Rs 1,835 in 2019). For maize crop, the amount proposed is Rs 1,850, an increase of Rs 90 from Rs 1,760 last year.The prices of cotton (medium staple) are Rs 5,515, up Rs 260 from Rs 5,255 last year, and that of long staple Rs 5,825, up Rs 275 from Rs 5,550 last year.Numerous challengesThe farmers face numerous challenges when it comes to sowing of kharif crops from June 10 due to shortage of labour in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic situation.“The farmers are going through tough times due to unavailability of labour and the meagre increase in paddy prices will rub salt into their wounds,” Kokari said.Jagmohan Singh, state general secretary of BKU (Dakaunda), said the input cost on paddy sowing was going to increase manifold after the labour exodus from the state.Prices of fertilisers and pesticides were increasing too due to the lockdown. Black marketing of Punjab agricultural University recommended seed varieties PR 128 and PR 129 was also pushing up input costs this time, he added. ‘Adopt MS Swaminathan’s recommendation’“Instead of the giving meagre hike in MSP, the Centre should have adopted the formula forwarded by the chairman, National Commission on Farmers, Dr MS Swaminathan, under which farmers are assured of MSP which accounts for the basic costs incurred on production plus 50% profit on that,” Singh said.The farmer leaders said labour costs were expected to double this year as migrant workers charged Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 per acre for sowing paddy while local labour in Punjab demanded Rs 5,000 to Rs 5,500 per acre.According to the state agriculture department, around 26.3 lakh hectares was expected to be covered under paddy cultivation, 5 lakh hectares under cotton and 2.7 lakh hectares under maize.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hike-of-rs-53-proposed-as-paddy-msp-is-peanuts-say-farmers/story-wwUg98Agsq8QVmodKIbEjK.html

25-05-2020||Chandigarh||Police beat up on-call cardiologist in Srinagar, say doctor manhandled policeman||A senior cardiologist at Shri Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital has alleged that he was harassed and beaten up by the police while he was en route to the hospital on May 23. The police have launched an enquiry while maintaining that the doctor had manhandled the policeman on duty. The complainant, Dr Syed Maqbool, was crossing Hawal Chowk when he was stopped by a policeman and asked to take a different route. The doctor showed him his I-card and the hospital’s duty roster to show that he was the cardiologist on call that day but to no avail.“On May 23, I was the cardiologist on call for SMHS and all other associated hospitals. I requested the policeman to allow me to pass as I was already getting late due to a traffic jam. However, the cop started abusing me. I got off my vehicle and asked him to confer with someone at his office, which enraged the policeman further. He started hitting me with his baton. In the meantime,the station house officer (SHO) arrived and dragged me to the policestation,’’ said Dr Maqbool.POLICEMAN LIKENED DOCTORS TO THIEVES: DOCTOR“On reaching the police station, the policeman took away my phone and the identity card. I repeatedly requested him to allow me to call my head of department and medical college principal as I was to deal with all emergency cases but the officer said all doctors were thieves who thrive by selling duplicate medicines and taking commission.”“It was only after I apologised that I was allowed to call my colleague and ask him to depute someone else. I was let go after my brother submitted a bond. My vehicle is still in police custody.’’Dr Maqbool alleged that the SHO warned him not to tell anybody about me being taken into police custody.‘OFFICER THREATENED TO STRIP ME NAKED’“The officer was extremely rude and threatened to strip me naked. I was harassed while performing my duty amid the Covid-19 pandemic.’’Upon being released, instead of going to home, Dr Maqbool walked six kilometers to the hospital and performed two angioplasties.“I am a senior interventional cardiologist who has represented state and country at multiple and national and international forums with multiple awards to my credit and if this is how I am treated by the police, I shudder to think what will become of my juniors. All of this while the world is dealing with a deadly disease that is killing thousands of people everyday,’’ he said.On being questioned about the manhandling charges, the cardiologist categorically refuted the charges: “The police ae lying. There are CCTV cameras on Hawal chowk and the footage will reveal the truth. Should I be found guilty, I am ready to face punishment. However, the arrogant police officer must be brought to book,’’ he said.DOCTORS DEMORALISED, THREATEN STRIKE Srinagar Medical College principal Dr Samia Rashid said she had taken up the issue with all top officials of the administration who had promised that action will be taken against the offending officer.“The doctor was on call and still he was stopped and jailed. This issue has demoralised our doctors, especially those on the frontlines. We are willing to go on strike against the police’s treatment of doctors.’’DOCTOR COMING FROM WRONG SIDE : POLICESrinagar SSP Haseeb Mughal said the doctor had reportedly tried to manhandle the policeman.“We had filed a complaint against the doctor after he reportedly manhandled a policeman who stopped him as he was coming from the wrong side. When the policeman stopped the doctor, he pushed the policemen saying he was in a hurry. Now, he has filed a complaint so I have asked the Hazratbal SP to investigate the matter. We have already taken legal cognisance of his misconduct,’’ the SSP said.‘WON’T ALLOW ANYONE TO MISBEHAVE WITH JAWANS’ “If one of our jawans are found at fault, disciplinary action will be taken but at the same time we will not allow anybody to manhandle and misbehave with police personnel who are on duty 24/7.’’The issue has created an uproar on the social media with many doctors saying frontline workers in Kashmir were being mistreated by the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/police-beat-up-on-call-cardiologist-in-srinagar-say-doctor-manhandled-policeman/story-EesLV0oAugdRoa2SxYMQ2M.html
25-05-2020||Pune||Pune city hospitals face staff crunch as nurses leave for hometowns||Even as the Pune civic administration has taken control of 80 per cent of beds in private hospitals, there is a severe staff crunch at many of these hospitals as nurses from other states have returned home during the lockdown, and are now unwilling to come back.During a meeting on Saturday with top authorities, including Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram, representatives from many private hospitals flagged the issue.According to these hospitals, a few hundred nurses, especially from Kerala, have resigned and returned home during lockdown as they feared contagion.In Pune, 70 per cent of nursing staff in most hospitals with more than 100 beds are from Kerala.Some of these nurses, according to Ram, have refused to come back to the city due to pressure from family, as reported by hospitals.“These hospitals are primarily concerned that even as they handover beds to government, there may not be sufficient nursing staff. As we assured them that we will also appeal these nurses that the government will provide all kinds of for the treatment of Covid patients,” said Ram.Ram further said that there is need to build confidence among these staff as there is fear. “We will try and convince these nurses, many of them from Kerala, not to leave jobs. If necessary as last resort, we will act against them under MESMA.”The state government on Friday decided to take charge of 80 per cent of total operational beds in private hospitals in Pune, Mumbai and other cities.The Pune district administration held a meeting in this regard with private hospitals and they were appraised about the decision.Pune-based Nobel hospital, which has been treating Covid patients, reported at least 100 nurses have resigned during past three months to return home.Most of these nurses, according to hospital authorities, are from Kerala.“We have been getting resignations of many nurses even since government have started special trains taking back migrant workers have started. On a daily basis, an average of seven want to leave even as we try and convince them to stay back,” said Dr H K Sale, one of the directors at Noble hospital, adding that he hasn’t accepted most of the resignations.According to Dr Riya Punjabi, medical superintendent at Inlaks and Budhrani hospital, the hospital is facing a class IV staff-crunch, but is able to manage at present with the strength of nurses working.“At Budhrani hospital, around 50 staff out of 260 have returned to their homes in the last two months. Some of them are reluctant to come back due to the Covid scare. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is now helping us with contacts of others where we can call and ask them to work,” Dr Punjabi said, adding thatsome staff living in Tadiwala road and Yerawada, which are red zones. Chief nurse at the Nobel hospital Trupti Nanda said that 80 per cent of the 400+ staff at the hospital hails from Kerala.“Of these 400-odd nurses, around 100 have returned to their respective towns in Kerala even as many still come to me with resignations,” said Nanda, adding the main concern for them is safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-city-hospitals-face-staff-crunch-as-nurses-leave-for-hometowns/story-DAiMYfWEREF9UaW3SlO7qJ.html

25-05-2020||Pune||Monday Musings: Preparing for phasing out of lockdown 4.0||Now that the economic engine is coming back to life with the gradual phasing out of lockdown 4.0, what should we expect in public places? Will people follow the cardinal rules of prevention from Covid-19 that we are all familiar with? Masks in public places, use of sanitisers, frequent handwash with soap and social distancing? Going by the indications that are available, social distancing is the first casualty that one sees at a number of places. Last week, we reported about this busy pre-dawn market on Satara road where retailers and wholesalers by the hundreds gather every morning to do their trade. There was absolutely no social distancing of any kind in this area which adjoins micro-containment clusters. In Pimpri-Chinchwad, red zone restrictions were lifted on Thursday and as per that order, all market areas and all shops, including salons and garages, could now remain open from 9 am to 5 pm. Although people were wearing masks, here too, social distancing was missing. In Pune, which has seen 248 Covid-19 deaths and 4,600 positive cases as of May 23, a number of shopkeepers are among those who have tested positive for Covid-19. The most glaring case is that of a medical wholesaler in the peth areas where seven shop assistants tested positive and spread the infection to 41 of their contacts in different parts of the city, including their own families, the shop owner and his family. While economic activity cannot be halted indefinitely and shops, offices, markets and public transport will start functioning sooner than later, it is for each individual to take the responsibility of protecting the self and family. As reported by us on Sunday, Dr Amar Fettle, Kerala’s state nodal officer for Covid-19, has advised a series of simple and easy to follow precautionary steps and strategies in the post-lockdown phase when we start stepping out for work and other activities. “ When you step out of the house, imagine that pink and green viruses are floating all over the place and on all kinds of surfaces- cars and shop counters. Keeping that in mind, always use a simple face mask. Remember that the virus will not come to your house on its own, unless you bring it. To avoid this hospitality, put on the mask every time you leave the house,” is his simple advice. “Wash your hands with soap every time you leave the house and enter. Sanitise your hands every time you leave shops, banks and offices. Wash your hands again and again till you are bored….”Washing of feet after coming from outside as was done by our previous generations; maintaining social distance in public places; taking special care of the elderly and those with conditions like diabetes, and teaching children ‘cough hygiene’ are some of the other steps that he has recommended.Dr Fettle urged people to listen only to medical experts; obey the guidelines issued by the government and the local authority and pay no heed to advice on social media. Maintaining health to build immunity, consuming healthy foods; fruits, vegetables and green leafy vegetables; avoiding hospitals for small illnesses and ensuing enough sleep and peace of mind would be important. As he advised, we need to be alert about our own safety; that of our family; our neighbours; friends who are in frequent contact and helpers such as housemaids. For now, this is the only universe that we need to focus on. abhay.vaidya@hindustantimes.com ****||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/monday-musings-preparing-for-phasing-out-of-lockdown-4-0/story-qRA0OTyLThWj5KyMlAAIVJ.html

25-05-2020||Patna||Migrants walk through ‘hell’ to reach ‘heaven’ in Bihar but stare at uncertain future||They had left their homes for greener pastures in faraway Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and Rajasthan.The corona-fuelled lockdown having shattered their dreams, they are now walking, cycling and hitchhiking hundreds of miles under an unforgiving sun blazing down at over 40 degrees to reach their homes in an impoverished Bihar, where an uncertain future awaits them.Hungry and exhausted, these migrant workers are arriving at Sonathu and other villages in Bihar’s Aurangabad district from places as far-off as Surat, Mumbai, Delhi, Jaipur and Chennai every day, carrying tales of trauma and tribulation.But nobody comes to embrace them and all are curtly directed to forlorn government schools and other buildings that pass off as institutional quarantine centres that would be their home for the next 21 days.Sonathu gram panchayat, with a population of around 10,000, has already received over 400 migrant workers, its head Poonam Devi told PTI over the phone. The area, about 60 km from state capital Patna, was a naxalite hotbed until a few years ago.Every returnee has a story to tell about how they made it back to their village, says Poonam Devi.“Coronavirus has forced people to walk through hell to reach heaven (home),” Moti Kumar, who hails from Dhamni village, said after returning from Chennai.Kumar and 11 others--a fellow villager and the rest from Banka district--commenced their daunting journey from Chennai on foot on May 13. It took them nearly 11 days to reach home.In the southern metropolis, the migrants from Bihar worked in a factory manufacturing rubber items for cars.“Losing our jobs and left with no money to pay for room rent, we started walking towards Bihar. But police drove us back from the Tamil Nadu-Andhra Pradesh border.“We were determined to reach home. So we sneaked our way through a forest and reached a national highway,” Kumar, who is now in home quarantine, said.Kumar’s group hitched rides on trucks to reach Jharkhand, from where they again set out on foot, and finally reached their village.His relative Gyanendra Kumar Singh said every day they see people trundling down the roads lugging suitcases and bundles clanking with utensils, betraying their migrant status.Satyendra Kumar, an advocate and social worker based in Daudnagar in the district, said 16 young men recently pedalled over 1,000 km from Delhi to reach their homes.At least 1,200 returnees have been housed in four quarantine centres in Daudnagar sub-division, he said.Some worked in cloth mills in Gujarat, while others were engaged in carpet making in Jaipur. Those in Delhi worked as masons and also in cable manufacturing units, Kumar said.All of them have managed to escape hunger and hoplessness in cities they had made their home. These cities, bustling with commercial activity and throbbing with life, fed their dreams of a better future that their tiny, somnolent villages cannot offer.Poonam Devi said jobs under MGNREGA and agricultural activity that are far less paying are their only options.“While the returnees are still in quarantine centres, their families have started approaching us for jobs under MGNREGA,” she said.Satyendra Kumar said under the state government’s instructions, MGNREGA job cards have been readied for 1,100 of the 1,200 returnees housed in the quarantine centres in Daudnagar.Many of these migrants were earning between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 a month outside Bihar.Shafalta Singh, a college principal and resident of Dhamni village, said, “These are difficult times but our village has the culture of accommodating everybody.” Looking at the brighter side of the reverse exodus of the migrant labourers, Satyendra Kumar said it may end the migration of “ropanniya” (seed planters) from Sitamarhi district in Bihar and Palamau and Latehar districts in Jharkhand to Aurangabad.The “ropanniya” outsiders take contract to plant paddy and get paid handsomely.Like Aurangabad, lakhs of migrants have returned to the villages of Bihar and many more are set to arrive on ‘Shramik Special’ trains, while in a departure from the trend, over 2,200 migrants from Khagaria district have returned to work in Telangana.The the exact number of migrants from Bihar working in other states is not yet known.In the initial days of homeward migration, Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi had put the number at 27 lakh.His estimate was based on the number of people who had received the state government’s assistance of Rs 1,000 per head and others who applications were being processed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/migrants-walk-through-hell-to-reach-heaven-in-bihar-but-stare-at-uncertain-future/story-K5glaR3mxCVDZBSfuwkAWK.html

25-05-2020||Bangalore||Bengaluru airport introduces ‘contactless journey’ to contain Covid-19||The Bengaluru airport management is introducing a unique feature of parking-to-boarding contactless journey for the passengers as the domestic flight resumes from Monday. In order to contain coronavirus transmission among passengers and staff, the Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) introduced the new feature of contactless journey right from pre-entry check to security check and boarding. “Contactless would be the buzzword at the Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru when operations resume from May 25,” the BIAL said in a statement on Sunday.

The technology will continue to enable a seamless airport journey, with greater emphasis on health and safety, the statement said. “We have introduced innovative contactless procedures to minimise exposure at the airport,” Hari Marar, managing director and chief executive officer of BIAL, said. “These enhancements demonstrate our continued commitment to keep our passengers safe in this environment.” According to the BIAL, the features include pre-entry process, where the passengers have to wear masks and carry e-boarding or printed passes. The travellers will undergo thermal scan and will have to show that the Aarogya Setu app on the passengers mobile phone has the ‘you-are-safe’ message. “CISF personnel will verify the boarding pass and Government-issued Photo ID using an electronic device or through a magnified glass screen,” it said. The doormats will be soaked with bleach at the terminal entrance to disinfect the shoes, the BIAL said. There will be contactless self-service kiosk where the passengers will collect the baggage tag before proceeding to the airline counter to drop-off luggage. A transparent partition has been installed at the airport, to ensure the safety of both airline staff and passenger at the airline bag drop counters. Under the new contactless process, body scanning will be done using door frame metal detectors. Stamping of the boarding pass has been suspended, as directed by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, the BIAL said. Before boarding, the airline staff will once again do thermal screening and then permit boarding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/bengaluru-airport-introduces-contactless-journey-to-contain-covid-19/story-m7YWTRrXVIj6ppzaQYtPMM.html

25-05-2020||Delhi||Namaz from home, virtual hugs: This Eid, Muslims appeal to stay indoors amid coronavirus scare||Shunning the old order is never easy, especially when it comes to deep-seated cultural and religious practices. But unprecedented times call for equally strong overhauls. As virtual becomes the new reality, Muslims across the country plan to offer Eid prayers from home and wish each other on video calls.“Eid for us has always been about opening our homes and hearts to our friends and celebrating with them with good food and banter. This Eid, we’ve decided to donate to various NGOs and charities that are looking after the most affected populations across the country,” says filmmaker Faraz Arif Ansari. The Sheer Qorma director has a message for all: “As a responsible citizen, we have to make sure we take every precautionary measure to stop a catastrophic spread of the virus. Congregating to perform the prayer could endanger lives, an act that is strictly forbidden in Islam. It is absolutely crucial that we celebrate Eid at home. Look out for one another, be compassionate and kind. Kindness will save the world.”When we talk about Eid in Delhi, it is hard to not mention Jama Masjid and the Walled City. People from all over, irrespective of religion, flock to this part of the Capital to partake in the revelries. The air is redolent of the aroma of delectable kebabs being slow-roasted over coal fire. Mosques have a steady stream of the faithful offering prayers. Abu Sufiyan, founder of Purani Dilli Walo ki Baatein, has been involved in community service, helping those affected severely by COVID-19.“Old Delhi has always been the centre of our syncretic Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb, and this time too, we are coming forward to help those in need, irrespective of their religion, region or ethnicity. With #EidApnoKeLiye, we plan to help raise funds and ration for migrant labours and other marginalised communities. To extend a helping hand in the hour of need is the true essence of Eid.”  Follow @puranidilliwaley Thank you Mufti Mukarram @zingyzest @girl.pilot @ranasafvi @wajid_khan_artist , @naziaerum @ishqurdu @nasheet_s @farazarifansari @syed.sadia & @delhi6wala for sending out message on #Eid #Eid2020 #eidmubarakA post shared by  Purani Dilli Walo Ki Baatein™ (@puranidilliwaley) on May 23, 2020 at 11:15am PDTAuthor Rana Safvi, who has been known to host gala feasts and keep an open house, echoes the sentiment. “ Iss baar Eid nahi, Eidi manaao. Hum har saal apne baccho ko toh Eidi dete hi hain, par iss saal unn logo ko bhi ration-paani do jinke paas kuch nahi hai. I will make something sweet for the family in the morning, but the celebrations would not be of the same scale,” she says. Read: Ramzan under lockdown: The indomitable spirit of the Walled CityFestivities are incomplete without the constant buzz of the doorbell, neighbours and family sharing traditional delicacies, and the little ones prancing about in shiny new clothes. But this is no time for nostalgia. “No one should have any FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Don’t be afraid of the situation as we are all in the same boat. There is no point in putting yourself and others around you at risk,” says 32-year old visual artist Nasheet Shadani. Sharing his plans for the day, he says it is going to be an e-Eid. “I plan to do video calls and share photos of the celebrations from my home. For the kids, Eidi (token money and gifts) will be transferred online,” he says, adding that he, along with some friends, is helping raise funds and ration for those who cannot afford it. “It is important to help those in the lower-income groups who have been rendered jobless. They are too self-respecting to ask for any charity. So we are identifying these people and providing ration to them,” he says.Even in the bleakest of time, a ray of hope shines through. Author Nazia Erum feels that one should look at the positives. “This too shall pass and next year we will have Eid where we will be with our loved ones. These are testing times for all of humanity, not just a particular community or country. Help those who need it the most. The money you would usually spend on Eid, divert it to the lesser-privileged,” she says. The pandemic has also brought with it new opportunities to express creativity, she feels. “I made and hand-painted paper lanterns at home with my kid. We also made toys at home using ice-cream sticks for a baby cousin,” she adds.

25-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi Metro all set to resume operation after Covid-19 lockdown, lays down rules for passengers: Report||After being shut for more than two months, the metro rail services in Delhi will resume soon, Hindustan Times’ Hindi language publication Hindustan reported on Monday.However, the metro which is known for its crowded coaches, will see very less number of people. Hindustan quoted Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) officials as saying that the passengers will have to follow social distancing norms and maintain a distance of one metre while travelling in the metro. Those who are sitting in the coaches will have to leave one seat vacant (occupying alternate seat). The DMRC has pasted stickers on the seat with a message of social distancing.All this will be monitored by metro officials through CCTV cameras, Hindustan reported.The revised guidelines, once implemented, will allow only 50 passengers in a metro coach. The DMRC runs metro trains with four, six and eight coaches on various routes. After the new guidelines, the longest train (of eight coaches) will have 400 passengers during a trip.Before the lockdown was implemented, 2,500 passengers used to travel in DMRC’s longest metro train.However, some passengers will be allowed to stand in coaches, Hindustan reported quoting DMRC officials.The DMRC has 300 metro trains which conduct 5,000 rounds on various lines (blue, red, yellow, violet etc). The metro connects many nearby cities to Delhi, like Noida, Ghaziabad (both in Uttar Pradesh), Gurugram and Bahadurgarh (in Haryana).The DMRC officials told Hindustan that after services resume, they will suffer 75 per cent operating loss. The DMRC has already suffered a loss or Rs 600 crore during the lockdown, and now, with reduced capacity, the train is likely to operate under more daily loss.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-metro-all-set-to-resume-operation-after-covid-19-lockdown-lays-down-rules-for-passengers-report/story-PuUqk2JuEbkONcTuoATxMM.html
25-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body withdraws notice sent to doctor for prescribing Covid-19 swab test||A day after HT had reported that a Ghatkopar physician was issued a show-cause notice for prescribing a coronavirus swab test to an asymptomatic patient, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Sunday has withdrawn the notice amid widespread criticism from the medical fraternity.As per the notice issued by Ajit Ambi, the assistant municipal commissioner of N ward, Dr Chetan Velani was found violating the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897; the Disaster Management Act, 2005, as well as the guidelines issued by BMC over Covid-19 testing. Stating that prescribing the swab test to an asymptomatic patient was in violation of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the civic body notice said Dr Velani’s licence would be cancelled if he failed to respond within 24 hours of receiving the letter. Ambi did not respond to HT’s calls. Dr Velani has refuted BMC’s allegations. “On Sunday, when I asked BMC to provide the details of the asymptomatic patient [who was allegedly prescribed the swab test], they couldn’t give me any information. Why would I waste the government’s resources if the patient is not a Covid suspect?”The physician himself was quarantined for 14 days, after he had been exposed to an asymptomatic Covid-19 patient. “The government should give some freedom to doctors on identifying the Covid patients. What if I don’t prescribe a swab test to a suspected patient and he dies owing to health complications? Then they will impose a medico-legal case on us,” said Dr Velani.Other doctors, too have come out in Dr Velani’s support. Dr Deepak Baid, president of Association of Medical Consultants, said that the physician did not violate any rule, as he prescribed the swab test after physically examining the patient. “ICMR wants us to wait until the patient shows symptoms. In the meantime, their health conditions keep deteriorating and the virus is transmitted to others, too. Instead of threatening us for doing our duty, the government should do theirs and provide us with PPE [personal protective equipment] to work,” he said.According to the rules of the Indian Medical Council (IMC), only the apex body holds the power to cancel the licence of a doctor. The corporation can’t cancel the registration of any doctor registered with the medical council. We are the only authorised body,” said Dr Shivkumar Utture, president of Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-withdraws-notice-sent-to-doctor-for-prescribing-covid-19-swab-test/story-udjqzeUlfYtAdeLstlCuJK.html
25-05-2020||Mumbai||6 customs officers in Mumbai test positive for Covid-19||Six customs officers have been tested positive for coronavirus in the past one week.Three of them, including a deputy commissioner of customs, are from the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), Nhava Sheva. He last reported to work on May 12 and was under home quarantine after he developed symptoms. On May 20, his test results came positive, said senior officials from the customs department.A commissioner and an assistant commissioner working with the air cargo at Sahar have also been tested positive for coronavirus.According to the internal communication accessed by the paper, the commissioner has been admitted to Apollo Hospital in Navi Mumbai and is responding well to the treatment, while the assistant commissioner has been quarantined at home.“All the officers who had worked with the duo have been asked to remain in isolation at home,” said a source, privy to the information.An officer deployed with the directorate general of vigilance (DGoV) department in the new customs house at Fort, too, has been found to be infected with the virus.Some customs officers have alleged that their seniors have insisted them to report to work, despite the fact that they can work from home.“Officers involved in active clearance of cargo have to report to work. However, those posted in the ancillary sections [which do not are not considered as essential services under the Centre’s guidelines] are also being asked to report to work,” a senior customs officers has alleged.Earlier, a sepoy posted at the new customs house had died on April 11 at Kasturba Hospital due to coronavirus.

25-05-2020||City||Lockdown forces many to change profession||For the past 14 years, Kalyan Harale, a resident of Ulhasnagar, used to leave his home around 7am to reach his office in Santacruz. The lockdown announced on March 22 changed it all. The real estate firm shut, leaving Harale, who worked in the administration section, jobless. Faced with the responsibility of his wife, 22-year-old engineering student son and elderly parents, the 48-year-old decided to start selling vegetables on a cart in Siddharth Nagar in Ulhasnagar.“It has been two months now. As I saw residents struggle to get vegetables in the initial phase of the lockdown, I decided to do the job,” said Harale. “I got in touch with local vegetable traders and started to sell vegetables on a hand cart. I earn around ₹300 a day and make half of my monthly salary, but we are managing.”Harale is one of the many who had to change their means of livelihood to sustain the lockdown. Another case in point: Raju Bausakar, 52, a resident of Dombivli, who has a photocopy shop near Brahman Sabha hall in Dombivli (East), now sells biscuits and bread outside it. “Since I opened my shop 30 years ago, I have never shut it for such a long period. I used to earn at least ₹15,000 a month. One of my daughters work, but I don’t like sitting idle. I go out and earn whatever little I can. I set up the stall at least thrice a week,” said Bausakar, who lives with his wife and two daughters.For Smita Palsekar, 47, a Kalyan resident, whose husband is bed-ridden after an accident, and who has two school-going children, not earning was not an option. “I have a fabric shop in Khadakpada in Kalyan (West), which has been shut for two months now. I used to earn around ₹60,000 a month. I now sell vegetables at housing societies, which give me permission to enter,” said Palsekar.She hired a pick-up for ₹15,000 a month to transport and sell vegetables. She earns around ₹1,500 a day. “I have got several regular customers in housing societies. I also take orders in advance,” she said.Santosh Gupta, 36, who has a laundry shop at Adharwadi in Kalyan, now goes out on a bicycle every morning to sell bananas. His family of three is in Madhya Pradesh. “I came to Kalyan as a construction worker and later opened a laundry shop. After the lockdown was announced, my friends gave me the idea of selling bananas. I get ₹40 for a dozen and manage to earn ₹800 a day,” said Gupta. “I have to send at least ₹10,000 to my family. I used to earn around ₹40,000 from the laundry shop, but I have to adapt to the changing circumstances. It is better than not earning at all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-forces-many-to-change-profession/story-zKPQB9C8o3UWm7C1G0aphP.html

25-05-2020||Mumbai||HT Salutes: Visually impaired IIT student raises funds, essentials for his Koli community||A few days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the national lock-down on March 24, Kailash Tandel received a call for help. The 36-year-old had recently started a doctoral thesis at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, and Bhagwan Vival often ferried him in his auto rickshaw inside its large leafy campus. Vival, in his 40s and a resident of the eastern suburb of Chandivli, wasn’t making enough money to run his household. Mumbai may be the most affected city in the country today, but even in March the effects of the coronavirus pandemic were felt almost immediately in a city. The heat was sweltering, businesses large and small had closed down and public transport, including three-wheelers had been stopped to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease.Tandel, who is visually impaired, decided to turn to his institutional department to raise funds for the driver; within a day, he collected ₹5,000. That’s when he decided to do this on a larger scale.A first-generation doctoral scholar in his family, Tandel belongs to the Koli community — one of the oldest surviving indigenous communities of the islands that were reclaimed and stitched up to form the city of Mumbai as we know it today. Traditionally, the community earns money through fishing, but the lock-down had put a stop to it. Some of the busiest fish markets in the city like Bhaucha Dhakka or Sassoon Dock in South Mumbai remain closed. “Some fisherfolk have started fishing for either self-consumption or selling their wares at a small-scale level but unless the markets open, there will be no business,” said Tandel, whose father Ganjan and brother Harshad, are fishermen. “Initially I waited to see if political representatives or community leaders are reaching out to the Koli communities. When I saw there was no help coming, I started collecting funds to help the fisherfolk,” said Tandel, who sought funds from IIT-B colleagues, connections to networks through his earlier alma mater, the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), and ration kits from non-governmental organisation, Yuva.In the past two months, he has built a team of 15 volunteers — from his own residential colony at Machimaar Nagar colony in Colaba — to provide dry ration, sanitary napkins and medicines to over 800 residents of Machimaar Nagar, Sudaam jhopdi, Darya Nagar and Murti Nagar, spread across southern Mumbai.The volunteers, including brother Harshad and his wife, Leena, make a list of people and their needs, note their mobile numbers and call them once they have kits ready. Apart from distributing the kits, the volunteers have also distributed 300 sanitisers.“We have also reached out to people with disabilities in areas like Palghar (on the outskirts of Mumbai) with the help of IIT-B For Justice,” said Tandel, referring to a collective of students, researchers and faculty members in the institute.“When I lost my eyesight, it took me 15 days to realise that I cannot see anymore but once I accepted the reality, it was easier to tackle all the problems,” Tandel said, who turned blind at age nine due to a genetic condition called retina pigmentosa. “A person can accomplish anything if his mind is still active. I am no different than people who have vision because I can also perform the same tasks with the help of technology,” he said and added that technology played an important role in organizing volunteer efforts through Zoom video conferencing calls and seeking funds on social media platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ht-salutes-visually-impaired-iit-student-raises-funds-essentials-for-his-koli-community/story-ubyBZvefLXbxo7dawVT0nJ.html
25-05-2020||City||Food stalls to be allowed on railway platforms from June 1||Railway authorities have decided to allow stalls selling food and books, besides food courts to start functioning on the platforms from June 1, when 200 passenger trains are set to resume operations, eight pairs of which will run on Punjab route. The decision was taken by the railway board for the convenience of passengers. However, there are certain guidelines which need to be followed by the stall owners.Senior divisional commercial manager (DCM) Vivek Sharma said that at railways stations, passengers usually follow the ‘take away’ system and most stations do not have a dinning facility. So stall owners will work the same way but they will have to take care of social distancing at their stall. Besides, it will also be mandatory for them to wear masks and gloves.Sharma added that at stations like Ludhiana and Amritsar where there are food courts, the staff will have to get the food packed for passengers.He added that the license fee for the period the stalls remained closed, will not be charged from stall owners.ONLY PASSENGERS WITH TICKETS WILL BE ALLOWED INSIDEThe reservation for trains resuming from June 1 has already started and this time, seats are being reserved even for general coaches as only those passengers with confirmed tickets are being allowed inside. No unreserved tickets (general tickets) are being sold at the counters.Moreover, the berths are not available on the trains. There are over 300 passengers on the wait list. Besides, the bookings for Saryu Yamuna Express to be running on June 1 and June 3 has been closed as there are already a large number of passengers on the wait-list. For the train for June 6, there are over 445 passengers on wait-list for sleeper coach in Saryu Yamuna Express. Similar were the status of other trains as well.Senior DCM Vivek Sharma said that the chart of a train is released four hours before the departure of the train from the station. So passengers whose seats are not be confirmed will know four hours in advance so that they don’t come to the station unnecessarily. He added that all passengers will be properly screened before being allowed to board the train and TTEs have also been directed to avoid close contact with passengers. “Although, passengers with confirmed tickets will be allowed to board the train but still TTEs will still come for checking. They have been provided gloves, masks and sanitisers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/food-book-stalls-to-be-allowed-on-railway-stations-from-june-1/story-oeFn0TOfQHwrlRGs1VquUO.html
25-05-2020||Mumbai||2 from Mumbai are MBA CET toppers||Two candidates from the city – Mumbai-based coaching institute teacher and mentor Shashank Prabhu, 34, and engineering graduate Ankit Thakker, 24 – emerged toppers of the state’s MBA common entrance test (CET) , as the results were announced on Saturday. A total of 1.1 lakh students appeared for the exam on March 14 and 15 and the results were delayed by two months.Shashank scored 159 out of 200, while Ankit scored 155 and got the second rank. Both of them scored 99.99 percentile. “This is my second attempt at CET as I wanted to better my score and be eligible for a seat in one of the top B-schools in Mumbai,” said Ankit, a resident of Chembur, who got his engineering degree from the Institute of Chemical Technology two years ago.This is the third time Shashank got the first rank in the entrance test and the sixth time he scored 99.99 percentile. Shashank said the overall scores of CET aspirants dipped this year because the visual reasoning (VR) part of the paper was more difficult compared to the past few years. “Surprisingly, Maths was easier,” said Shashank, a resident of Dombivli.While 16 students with scores between 159 and 146 scored 99.99 percentile, seven scored 99.98 percentile in the exam this year. A total of 1,041 students scored 99 percentile and above, while over 1,200 candidates scored less than 1 percentile in their test.The qualified candidates can now register themselves for the online counselling session, following which students will get to choose the institutes they want to seek admission in. The CET cell, however, is yet to announce an admission schedule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-from-mumbai-are-mba-cet-toppers/story-Mgnjha90REa5OAqxg15p5J.html
25-05-2020||City||Migrants in Navi Mumbai fall prey to fraudsters||Desperate to reach home, migrants have become easy targets of fraudsters, who cheat them of their savings by promising road transport or seat on trains.“My only wish was to see my ailing father one last time. An acquaintance told me a truck was charging ₹4,000 for the journey to Samastipur in Bihar. I paid, but the police caught the truck on the highway and we were brought back to Panvel,” said Sabina Mallik, who works as a house help. “I have no money left and my father is no more. I want to go back home. I did many rounds of the registration centre for the special train and am now waiting for my name to appear on the passengers’ list,” said the mother of a five-year-old, who lives in a chawl in Panvel.Many who have been cheated shy away from reporting to the police, fearing action against them.Bittu Singh, 32, from Araria in Bihar, who works as an electrician for housing projects in Panvel, used to earn ₹800-₹1,000 a day. “After one-and-a-half months of the lockdown, I was left with ₹1,800. A friend told me they were arranging a small vehicle and I gave him ₹1,500. I didn’t hear from him after that. I didn’t have the patience to lodge a complaint,” he said.Satish Gaikwad, senior inspector from Kalamboli police station, said, “When they come for registration for Shramik train, they tell us about being cheated. We tell them not to go in unauthorised transport vehicles.”The Navi Mumbai police have so far registered 40,000 migrants for Shramik special trains.Babasaheb Tupe, senior inspector from Kamothe police station, said, “Our advice to migrant workers is wait for your turn.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrants-in-navi-mumbai-fall-prey-to-fraudsters/story-vgdn2oXYbd11fio0QD0VPJ.html
25-05-2020||Chandigarh||Fruit and veggie vendors have hiked rates, complain customers in Chandigarh||After the municipal corporation (MC) discontinued the use of Chandigarh Transport Union (CTU) buses to supply vegetables and fruits, complaints have come in of vendors not charging rates fixed by the UT market committee daily and increasing prices.A round of the city revealed that most vendors were marking up prices by at least Rs 10 for bananas, melons, watermelons, potatoes and onions. They also did not have rate lists on display.“What is the point of issuing a rate list if vendors don’t comply with it? They are rude to us when we mention the rates fixed by the market committee and refuse to sell to us,” says Ashok Prashar, president, HIG flats resident welfare association (RWA), Sector 43-B.He claims he was charged Rs 40 over and above the given rate per kilo for items such as ginger and capsicum.MANY VENDORS WITHOUT PERMITS“There is a major problem with illegal vendors coming into sectors without permits and charging what they fancy. They use rehris (carts). We have informed the police many times about them, but no action is taken,” says Kuljinder Singh Sra, general secretary, Sector 33-B RWA.Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Residents’ Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED), said he would request the MC and UT market committee to resolve the issue.When questioned, the vendors said they were compelled to increase prices as wholesale mandis were charging more, a claim refuted by an official of the UT market committee. “Some vendors without passes buy vegetables and fruits from middlemen who overcharge them and they pass on the costs to customers,” said an official who did not wish to be named.PLEA TO REINTRODUCE CTU BUSESMeanwhile, Ajay Jagga, member, District Consumer Protection Council, has written to UT adviser Manoj Parida asking that CTU buses continue to sell farm produce even after easing of the lockdown. “The CTU as well as the market committee benefited from the arrangement. The presence of an official on the bus will ensure that vendors won’t hike their rates,” he said.Parida’s response, however, was that the buses were used earlier since markets were closed, but now with easing of restrictions, people could go to mandis to buy what they wanted. The buses had to be operated as public transportation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fruit-and-veggie-vendors-have-hiked-rates-complain-customers-in-chandigarh/story-wapXMUo3sn5AuvErJpNCSI.html
25-05-2020||City||Train to ferry 1.6K migrants to Kerala cancelled from Thane at last minute||A Shramik special scheduled to ferry 1,600 migrants from Thane, Mumbai and Navi Mumbai from Thane to Ernakulam in Kerala was cancelled a few hours before the scheduled departure at 6pm on Sunday, prolonging the workers’ wait to return home. The Central Railway (CR) officials blamed the cancellation on the lack of coordination between the state and Kerala governments.“The train was ready to depart for Kerala, but it had to be cancelled after a request from their government,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officer, CR, Mumbai. “According to the Thane collectorate, the train had to be cancelled as the Kerala government did not give consent for it on the grounds of non-availability of e-pass,” said a senior official from CR.The list of 1,600 passengers was made by representatives of the Malayalee community, based on the request of migrants. The train was the first scheduled service between Thane and Ernakulam, as the previous one departed from LTT, Mumbai.“The passengers from Thane, Vasai, Andheri and Navi Mumbai travelled to the station at least three-four hours early to complete the formalities such as medical test and verification. Around 2pm, the passengers were told the train had been cancelled,” said Shashikumar Nair, general secretary, All Thane Malayalee Association. “I reached the station, with my two children and a friend who is five-months pregnant. A few days ago, we got an inquiry call from the gram panchayat office in my village, Kaiparambu, in Thrissur district in Kerala. Late on Saturday, we got the confirmation about the train,” said Shreeja Shaji, 36, a resident of Vasai. “We were told the Kerala government cancelled the train due to lack of quarantine facility. It was so disappointing to hear this, as a few days ago the Kerala government said they are equipped with a quarantine facility for four lakh migrants,” added Shaji.“As soon as we learned about the cancellation, we informed around 60% of the passengers who were on their way to Thane station,” said Nair.A group of six women from Andheri, in the 22-25 age group, who were worked at an ayurvedic centre, said they are clueless about the future. “We have lost our jobs. After our train was confirmed, we vacated our rental homes. Now we don’t where to stay,” said one of them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/train-to-ferry-1-6k-migrants-to-kerala-cancelled-from-thane-at-last-minute/story-t96WkjL7YXReV70515U6pM.html
25-05-2020||Mumbai||Maha allows 50 flights to operate to and from Mumbai||The state government on Sunday allowed the operation of 50 flights to and from Mumbai from May 25, ending the uncertainty over the resumption of domestic flights in Maharashtra. Mumbai is one of the six cities selected by the civil aviation ministry for starting domestic flights. “We have decided to start flight operations from Mumbai. Initially, 25 flights each for landing and take-off will be allowed to operate from the city. Operations will be increased gradually,’’ said state minority affairs minister Nawab Malik. The Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL), which operates the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (CSIA), confirmed the same. “Starting May 25, 2020, CSMIA will resume 25 commercial passenger flight movements on departure and 25 on arrival,” said the MIAL spokesperson.However, a senior civic official from the city said they are yet to receive a standard operating procedure to follow from the state government, while there is no clarity on how passengers will commute. The decision came hours after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray publicly expressed reservations on resuming commercial domestic operations in Maharashtra, considering the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases. He said that he was not keen allowing interstate movement as there would be rise in cases in the state. Before that, Thackeray also spoke to Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri, requesting him to allow only minimal flights in the state. The state government has also informed MIAL that they will provide all possible assistance for smooth start of operations, but in a phased manner.“Today, I spoke to the aviation Minister, Hardeep Singh Puri. I told him let us get an estimate of things. We don’t want this lockdown to go on for five years. We also want to start flights, but we need to find out certain things, such as how will passengers come? What precautions will you take, how many employees would be needed at the airport, if it is supposed to begin etc.,” Thackeray said in a live address on Sunday. He also added that the state is working on a plan to allow interstate movement. However, even though 50 flights will resume from Monday, there is no clarity on how passengers estimated at around 27,000 daily (as per estimates by MIAL) will commute from the airport to their destinations. Public transport, including taxis, buses, app-based cabs are not permitted in the city. Inter-district commute is also not allowed. As such, the commute of airport and airline staff also poses challenges. It was not clear from which part of cities they will commute and whether it falls in containment zones, which have total movement restrictions, said a senior government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Earlier, on Sunday morning, state home minister Anil Deshmukh also openly criticised the decision of starting domestic flights in red zones. He said that opening of airports in red zone is extremely ill-advised as it will be add stress on these zones. Mere thermal screening of passengers is not adequate. With maximum Covid-19 cases across the country, Mumbai is currently in the red zone.P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We are yet to receive a standard operating procedure to follow from the state government. Basic preparation will be screening of passengers and a stamp for home quarantining them. Passengers will have to manage their own commute and in exceptional cases, the airport operator will be making arrangements. Everybody will be allowed to go home with a stamp.”For passengers who will be arriving for a short visit in the city, the BMC officials will not stamp them, while considering the number of days they are on a visit. BMC officials said that the only concern is about passengers who might have their houses in containment zones, for which an SOP from the state government is awaited.The commencement of operations from Mumbai is subject to the following conditions mandated by the state government: Guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare are strictly adhered to; all arriving passengers shall be hand stamped at the airport for 14 days home isolation and for self-monitoring their health; all passengers are required to make their own travel arrangements to and from airport; airlines shall verify that the addresses of passengers are not from the containment zones; passenger manifest containing detailed contact addresses and mobile numbers of all arriving passengers shall be submitted by airlines,at least six hours prior to the flight’s arrival time, to MIAL for submission to the BMC Commissioner, said a senior official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-allows-50-flights-to-operate-to-and-from-mumbai/story-mpJe2AWMyrawoRfU5C1eDI.html

25-05-2020||Chandigarh||IIT Ropar develops anti-microbial coating for PPE kits, fogging sprays||A research team from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Ropar comprising Narinder Singh, C Raman Suri, Harpreet A Singh and Amanpreet Singh have developed noble synthetic materials for anti-microbial coatings on personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, sprays for disinfecting tunnels and fogging purposes.According to Singh, these materials are non-volatile in nature, with no foul smell and possess very high anti-microbial activities and show high shelf life on different metallic and non-metallic surfaces.He said the team has developed two types of coatings: Hydrophilic and hydrophobic. Therefore, one can use them based on the area of application. Hydrophilic materials are primarily meant for fogging and spraying on walls; while hydrophobic are specifically designed for coatings on PPE kits, hospitals and furniture.He added that the materials have excellent physico-chemical properties, and they can be used in a broad range of temperatures under varied environmental conditions.Singh said the team had tested the materials against broad range of microbes and established the mechanism of action of materials. Singh said the institute is filing the IPR and several private companies have already contacted the institute and technology is transferred to E2H Technologies LLP under non-exclusive licensing.He added that the institute would provide the non-exclusive technology transfer to other companies as well and the team was also developing rapid test kits for the diagnosis of Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/iit-ropar-develops-anti-microbial-coating-for-ppe-kits-fogging-sprays/story-GDeu0Li2M1glPjOOARSIRM.html
25-05-2020||Mumbai||Drug addict held for friend and sadhu’s murder in Nanded district||A 25-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly murdering his friend and a sadhu (seer) in Nagthana village of Nanded inside an ashram early on Sunday. Sainath Lingare, who is a drug addict, was arrested around eight hours later within the Tanur police station limits along the Maharashtra-Telangana border, the police said. According to the police, as per their preliminary inquiry, it has been discovered that Lingare wanted to break inside the ashram and steal money and had asked his friend Bhagwan Shinde, 50, to be an accomplice. When refused to be an accomplice in the crime, the accused strangled the victim and dumped his body in the ashram’s bathroom. He then entered the room of the sadhu, Swami Rudra Pratap Maharaj, 33. When the seer woke up, Lingare threw chilli powder in his eyes, which he had carried with him, and before the victim could raise an alarm, the accused strangled him, the police said.“Lingare then dumped Maharaj’s body in a car and tried to flee but his vehicle dashed into the ashram gate. Hearing the noise, the other sadhus, who were sleeping on the ashram’s terrace, came down, said Anantre,” said inspector Ashok Anantre of Umri police station at Nanded.Lingare had parked his friend’s bike at his home near the ashram. He took the two-wheeler and managed to flee. The others in the ashram informed the police about the murders, following which they began investigations. “We had alerted the police in the neighbouring districts and shared Lingare’s picture with them based on eyewitnesses’ statements. Around 4pm, Lingare was nabbed from Tanur area, Vijaykumar Magar said, superintendent of police, Nanded district, said. “Lingare is a resident of Nagthana village and is a drug addict. He was charged for murder around 10 years ago, but he was a minor then. He had killed a man along with his father. He also has a case of car theft against him” said police inspector Ashok Anantre of the Umri police station. During the inquiry, we learnt that Lingare and Shinde had met each other at a zilla parishad school, around 700 metres away from the ashram. Lingare has been booked under sections 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender), 452 (House-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal code (IPC).“We are trying to ascertain how much money has he robbed from the ashram,” said Anantre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/drug-addict-held-for-friend-and-sadhu-s-murder-in-nanded-district/story-aVAoLisEHbzDty3BN9SfmK.html
25-05-2020||Mumbai||‘Politics during Covid not our culture’: Thackeray slams BJP||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday put his former ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in his line of fire for playing politics while the state government is battling against the Covid-19 pandemic. Two days after BJP staged a protest against the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), Thackeray, in his address to the state on Sunday afternoon, said that his government will not indulge in politics “as it does not suit the culture of Maharashtra”. The CM added that Covid-19 cases in the state are likely to increase by May end. Since last week, the state is recording over 2,000 new cases daily, but the Centre’s projection that Maharashtra would have around 1.25-1.50 lakh cases has not come true. Thackeray said that the state is prepared to tackle the surge in cases.“These are testing times, nobody should indulge in politics now. Even if you do, we will not because the people of Maharashtra have faith in us,” Thackeray said.“I have honestly said the Centre is helping us. But GST refund is yet to reach us, should I make it an issue? Earlier PPE kits were not coming. There is still a deficiency in the supply of medicines. We are yet to get the money for the trains...Just playing politics for the sake of it does not suit the culture of Maharashtra...” the CM said.The BJP, led by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, had staged Maharashtra Bachao (Save Maharashtra) agitation on May 22 and demanded a financial package worth Rs 50,000 crore for farmers and daily wage earners.In a veiled jibe at the Opposition party, Thackeray said that the state government is not going to announce “empty packages” but do “actual” work. “Some people are asking why have you not announced a package? Till now many packages [by the BJP] worth crores have been announced. They are packaged nicely but when you open, it is an empty box. The MVA government does not announce empty packages,” he said. Following Thackeray’s address, BJP leader Ashish Sheler took to Twitter and said, “The CM says first they will defeat corona and then announce package. This is like saying giving water to someone after he dies. He earlier said they would defeat corona before monsoon, now he says numbers are going to increase. Earlier he said Central team has given no projection, now he says numbers are lower than their projection. Sir, daily the direction and speeches are changing. Who is he actually telling not to do politics? To MP Sanjay Raut and minister Jayant Patil?”Thackeray also outlined the state government’s steps taken for the people and migrant labourers including widening the scope of Shiv Bhojan scheme, following up with the Centre to give food grains for people who do not have ration cards, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Aarogya Yojana, etc. He said that 5.5 to 6 lakh migrant workers have been provided food till now.“The public insurance scheme gives 100% free treatment to all. This is a package, should we announce it and advertise or should we keep working?” said Thackeray. The CM added, “Cases will increase. We have created hospital infrastructure for it. By the end of May, we will make 14,000 beds available. We already have 7,000 beds, including 3,000 in our field hospitals.”The CM also said that he has sought more time from the civil aviation ministry to prepare for the resumption of domestic air travel in the state. “Today morning I spoke to [Hardeep Singh] Puri and told him that let’s get an estimate… of how the passengers would come; what measures would you [Centre/ministry of civil aviation] take, what measures do we [state government] would need to take. If we have to reopen the airport, what would be the required of staff, etc,” he said.A tweet by the chief minister’s office stated that Thackeray spoke to Puri on the resumption of domestic flights: “He [Thackeray] communicated his views that till the time MIAL plans and fine tunes airport operations, they should initiate minimum possible domestic flights from Maharashtra from May 25th which are purely emergent in nature like for international transfer passengers, medical emergencies, students, and cases on compassionate grounds.”Thackeray said that imposing lockdown immediately and lifting it in a go is akin to “putting axe on both your feet”. He said that just as the state went into a graded lockdown in March, the lifting of the lockdown would happen gradually. He hinted that there could be more relaxations after May 31, when the fourth phase of the lockdown ends.The CM also appealed to people to celebrate Eid inside their homes and not come on the streets. “Several exemptions have been made but it’s important not to crowd shops when they open. We will still need to follow instructions. Congregations, religious functions are still not allowed. Celebrate at home to emerge out of this situation in a better and effective way,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/politics-during-covid-not-our-culture-thackeray-slams-bjp/story-mtV82k6XCNBu0XgSm4l9dN.html

The man arrested has been identified as Vikas, a native of Jind, Haryana, and currently living in Sector 27, Panchkula. Complainant Mohit Sheokand told the police that on Saturday night, his mother and he were out for a walk in the society complex, when two men– Vikas and Amit Mor, arrived in a car at the main gate and started hurling abuses at him.Later, the duo entered the society premises with iron rods and attacked him, Sheokand alleged. Police said as per the complaint, seven to eight accomplices of the accused then attacked his father and brother with iron rods and sticks. Investigating official, assistant sub-inspector Rajbir Singh, said as per the complainant, one of the accused snatched his iPhone and gold chain during the commotion.“The complainant said the accused had a fight with him on May 8 as well, but they later reached a compromise. The attack seems to be a fallout of the enmity between them,” Singh said. A case has been registered against eight persons under Sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence commit¬ted in prosecution of common object), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 323 ( voluntarily causing hurt), 379-B (snatching and use of force), 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrong¬ful restraint) and 506 ( criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code at the Chandimandir police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/one-arrested-7-booked-for-assaulting-man-at-housing-society-in-panchkula/story-ki0her2suwPEuvdUBzqE9M.html

25-05-2020||Mumbai||Govt college medical students allege they are being discriminated over accommodation||Medical students from government colleges working with Covid patients have alleged that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has refused to accommodate around 90 resident doctors from St George Hospital in hotels. They claimed that they had to wait for hours on the road after their duty to find alternative accommodation. The state medical department had arranged for the West End Hotel at Marine Lines for the resident doctors who are on duty at St George Hospital, which has been converted into a Covid hospital. On May 20, six-seven government resident doctors went to the hotel to stay, but the BMC officials did not provide them accommodation there, the students have alleged. “They didn’t let us in stating that the hotel is reserved for BMC staffers on Covid duty and had asked us to leave. We had to wait on the road from 2pm to 4pm, after which we were informed that we had been given alternate accommodations at Bengal Hotel,” said a second-year postgraduate student. However, when they reached Bengal Hotel, BMC officials cited the same reason and asked them to leave. “Then we had to go back to our hostel and stay with resident doctors who had not been on Covid duty, thereby risking their chances of infection,” said the student. The students have also alleged that unlike BMC officials, they have been given cheap hotels without proper ventilation. “We feel suffocated when we enter the rooms. Also, the bathrooms aren’t cleaned properly,” said another resident doctor. The students have written letters to the collector seeking proper accommodation. “BMC doctors are getting five-star hotels such as the Taj, while we get unhygienic hotels. We are also working 24/7 and risking our lives. So, why are we being discriminated?” said a student.An official from St George Hospital informed that the decisions of the government medical colleges are taken by the city collector, while for medical colleges under BMC, the responsibility is undertaken by the civic commissioner. Dr Ramesh Bharmal, director of medical education, BMC, said, “The hotel accommodation is different for the students of BMC and the state government. I am personally not aware of such an incident. But will look into it.”Dr TP Lahane, director of the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) did not respond to HT’s calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/govt-college-medical-students-allege-they-are-being-discriminated-over-accommodation/story-8whaZmAcHid5Lxs0HpdkxM.html

The residents allege that there has been a two-fold increase in the bill amount from the previous bills.The city-based activist also raised the issue of the increased bill on twitter.Ranjana Sadolikar who heads citizen’s Unity Forum, Kamothe, said, “At this point of time when the entire country is going through a financial crisis it is unjust to increase the water bills by the developing body. I raised the issue with Cidco as well as tweeted about the problem and tagged chief minister’s office, home minister, Anil Deshmukh, guardian minister, Eknath Shinde among many. Cidco then rolled back their decision and have decided to implement the increase after six months.”“The increased water bill came as a big surprise for everyone as there was no prior intimation regarding this,” said Sadolikar.Priya Ratambe, public relations officer, Cidco said, “The revision of water charges has been deferred for next months in Cidco area of Navi Mumbai.”“The decision of rate revision of water charges was of January 2020 and implemented in the billing cycle of Feb-March 2020. This rate revision was done after 15 years considering the procurement of water and maintenance charges of supply equipment’s,” said Ratambe.She further said, “However considering the pandemic, Cidco has decided to defer the rate revision of water charges for the next six months. Though no revised bills will be issued, the settlement will be done in the next billing cycle as per old rates.”Suresh Sadolikar, secretary Vrundavan Park, Kamothe said, “ We got a message from Cidco to pay the water bill of Rs 1,17,009 on or before May 31 against water charges for months of February and March, our previous bill was only Rs 5,1247. I hurriedly called Cidco officials who said that the rates have been increased in a slab wise manner from February 20.”“None of the societies was given any circular regarding the increase in water bill hence, we argued with officials terming it unjust. We also said that it was unjust to increase the bill at this critical point,” said Sadolikar.“There is a two-fold increase in the bill from the past water bill for the same consumption due to an increase in the rate for water charges from Rs 7 per cubic meter to Rs 20 (slab wise) per cubic meter. However the increase rate will not apply for the next six months,” said a Cidco official.The residents who were surprised at the sudden inflated bill are of the view that as of now they are not in a position to take the financial burden hence, the developing should have considered the circumstances first.Similarly, Subham Rane, committee member, Exotica society said, “We were shocked to get a double bill of around Rs 3 lakhs instead of Rs 1.05 lakh towards the water charges of society. I immediately complained about the issue to the Cidco officials who assured that issue will be looked in,”“Later on I got an intimation that the bill amount was as per increased charges, but the increased charges will be applicable after six months. We are relieved for now at least,” said Rane. Residents are also of the view that Cidco should first improve the quality of service, bridge the gap between demand and supply then think to increase the water charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cidco-defers-water-charge-hike-by-6-months-after-residents-protest/story-dF4FckmRpUl9mLbqDcZvnJ.html

25-05-2020||Chandigarh||Epicentre Bapu Dham Colony accounts for 72% of Chandigarh’s total cases||One month after the first Covid-19 case was reported in Bapu Dham Colony on April 24, the area, which has since become Chandigarh’s epicentre, now accounts for city’s 72% positive cases.Of the total 262 cases confirmed in the city since March 18, when UT’s first case came to fore, 189 are from the congested colony in Sector 26, which has 2,500 multi-storey houses.While the curfew was lifted in most of the remaining city on May 3, Bapu Dham Colony continued to be sealed. But there have been 146 more cases since.Sporadic testing, scattered use of institutional quarantine and poor enforcement of social distancing norms within the containment zone are behind UT administration’s failure to break the chain of infection in the colony, say health experts. Residents trying to sneak out of the colony, while even clashing with cops on duty, are another challenge.QUARANTINE AND SOCIAL DISTANCINGA senior epidemiologist at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), not wishing to be named, said the consistent rise in cases made it clear that violation of the quarantine rules was rampant in the containment zone.“Declaring an area as containment zone is not only to isolate a certain population from the city, but to also ensure that the residents within the zone practice social distancing. Infection spread in Mohali’s Jawaharpur village was apparently restricted because residents adhered to social distancing and quarantine within the village. That is missing in Bapu Dham Colony,” said the expert.An internal report prepared by Chandigarh Police had recently flagged violation of social distancing in Bapu Dham Colony as people were freely roaming even during the night curfew.A report by five experts from different departments of PGIMER also suggested that colony residents, irrespective of their health status, should be quarantined at some different location as was done in the case of Dharavi in Mumbai. However, the administration’s efforts in this regard were too little, too late.Two quarantine facilities were set up at girls’ hostel number 8 at Panjab University and Government Model School, Raipur Kalan, only on May 22, when the number of cases in the colony had reached 147.“We have seen family members of several positive cases interacting freely with their neighbours and roaming around. By using institutional quarantine early, this could have been avoided and the infection chain broken,” said Varinder Pal, a resident living in the containment zone.TESTING PICKING UP ONLY NOW From April 24 – when the first surfaced in the area – till May 18, only 569 people were tested in the colony, out of which 128 residents were found infected.On May 22, the UT health department scaled up testing, and decided to test all residents living in the same building as positive persons. Since then, 272 residents have been sampled at the sampling centre set up in the colony itself.“The testing has not been aggressive. Most people live in one-room dwellings and the administration has practiced the same approach as that for well-organised colonies. Testing of not only close contacts, but also of immediate neighbours is important here. What they are doing now, should have been done when the number of cases was inching towards the 100 mark,” the PGIMER epidemiologist said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/epicentre-bapu-dham-colony-has-72-of-chandigarh-s-total-cases/story-FZGwaEMPtGuArNouJQ3bDN.html

Officials said upon her return, she was placed under quarantine in a three-star hotel in Faridabad. Thirteen new coronavirus cases were reported from the district on Sunday, taking the district’s tally to 208. Yashpal Yadav, deputy commissioner, Faridabad, said that during her 14 days’ quarantine period, her samples were taken again and she has tested positive. “We have shifted her to a room in a hotel in Faridabad and have placed her in isolation,” he said.He said there are 221 foreign returnees in Faridabad who had landed in Delhi this month and were placed in quarantine in different hotels in the city.“Ten people were shifted to Sonipat, two were shifted to Nuh, four to Jind, and 61 to other districts. Ten people were released after they completed their 14-days’ quarantine period,” said Yadav.The health department said a total of 134 people are currently in quarantine ward in ESIC Medical College and Hospital, out of which 110 tests were conducted and one woman was found to be positive.According to officials, the district has so far recorded 208 cases of coronavirus, of which 115 people have recovered. The administration last week had added 12 new areas to the revised list of containment zones, while two zones in the district were de-notified after no Covid-19 cases were reported from these areas in the last 28 days.The deputy commissioner further said, “We had sent the samples of 9,288 people, of which 208 tested positive and the results of 550 are awaited. At least 80 people are currently hospitalised.”The infected people have been admitted to the ESIC hospital, officials said, adding that at least 9,285 people are under home quarantine in the district and 7,449 people are on surveillance for influenza-like illnesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/foreign-returnee-tests-covid-positive-in-faridabad-tally-now-at-208/story-IMEexCaEfadHoflKGFnehO.html
25-05-2020||City||Angry over affair, Ambala man kills elder brother||Five days after a 35-year-old man was found dead at a house near Tangri river in Ambala, the police on Sunday arrested his younger brother who confessed to murder.The accused was identified as Gaurav, a labourer in his late 20s, who had earlier said that his brother Ravi had died by falling from his bike on Tuesday late night. Police said their father had lodged a similar FIR. Gaurav told the police that Ravi, also a labourer, had been in an affair with their paternal aunt for the last three years. She was a mother of four girls and wife to an alcoholic, police said, adding that Gaurav had cautioned Ravi against the relationship on multiple occasions.On Tuesday, the brothers got drunk and got into an argument. Police said Gaurav hit his elder brother with a heavy object, and later took him to a hospital but the doctors declared him dead.Mahesh Nagar station in-charge Jaswant Singh said, “We have recovered the evidence including the heavy object and blood-stained clothes. We arrested Gaurav and presented him before a court, which sent him to judicial custody.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/body-found-in-ambala-younger-brother-confesses-to-murder/story-QU857XiuxYjGJ4e77XfubL.html
25-05-2020||Delhi||AAP decries ‘ugly politics’ after High Court approves of audit||New Delhi: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of indulging in “ugly politics” during a health crisis, pointing to an order by the Delhi high court that refused to scrap the state government’s Death Audit Committee and said it was following guidelines “in full letter and spirit”.A plea filed the All India Lawyer’s Union last Thursday alleged that the Delhi government’s data about the number of persons suffering from and dying of the deadly pathogen was incorrect, and had asked for its audit committee, which certifies all Covid-related deaths, to be scrapped.On Friday, a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan, while refusing to issue any direction against the committee, said the whole case of the petitioner was “based upon presumptions and surmises as the same has been filed on the basis of some newspaper reports without any proper research” and “there is no doubt that members of the committee are experts in their subject and field”.In its four-page judgment, uploaded on the website on Saturday, the court said, “……It further appears that on the basis of the guidelines issued by the Central government, the data is being collected from the hospitals in a proper format. It also appears that the respondents [Delhi government] have constituted a Death Audit Committee on April 20, 2020, for auditing the data in question received from different hospitals in Delhi and thereafter publish the same…There is no doubt that the members of the committee are experts in their subject and field. There seems to be no arbitrariness or discrimination being done nor is there is any material to show false fabrication of data in question being published by the respondents.”Reacting to the judgment, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday tweeted, “I am glad that honourable Delhi High Court has put an end to ugly politics being played by some opposition leaders on such a sensitive issue. Delhi govt is providing correct figures related to Corona every day to the people.”AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said, “After high court order declaring Delhi government’s Covid death figures correct, BJP should apologise for playing politics over the dead. The Delhi high court has noted that the Death Audit Committee is a competent authority comprising of experts. It rejected the plea seeking its scrapping. The High Court finds no arbitrariness or discrimination, no false fabrication of data. The BJP chose to do dirty politics even in the time of such massive health and humanitarian crisis.”The BJP, which is the ruling party in all the three municipal corporations in Delhi, said the death figures quoted by its leaders are based on information available with the civic agencies.Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, said: “The BJP didn’t go to the Delhi high court in this regard and we don’t know what facts were placed before the court in this matter. We are not doing politics. We have just stated the facts based on the information provided by the three municipal corporations. If the Delhi government thinks that the information provided by the municipal corporation is wrong, then they are free to take action against the corporations.”He added that the death figures was cited by the government’s own doctors. “The Delhi government should come out with datewise and hospital-wise data about Covid-19 deaths. This will put the matter to rest. People of Delhi have the right to know the truth.”While BJP leaders said they respect the Delhi high court order, they stood by the claims made by the corporations.Jai Prakash, the standing committee chairman, North Delhi Municipal Corporation said the “figures we have stated are based on the information collected by our officials from the cemeteries and cremation grounds” and that there have been 350 cremations and burial as per Covid-19 protocols in the region, “of which close to 272 were confirmed cases”. Bhupinder Gupta, chairman of South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s standing committee, said: “Our figures are based on the reports provided by the hospitals. We have had 381 dead bodies cremated or buried in our facilities. If we go by the Delhi government data, are the doctors at the hospital lying?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-decries-ugly-politics-after-high-court-approves-of-audit/story-2BfnJJsGqPxTFqLa3U6z4J.html
25-05-2020||Delhi||Squabble over use of 100W bulb ends in tenant’s death in Delhi||A petty argument over the use of a 100 watt bulb between a homeowner and his tenant took a violent turn on Friday when an e-rickshaw driver died after he was allegedly slapped by his landlord and, while reeling from the impact, his head hit the wooden armrest of a sofa, police said.The e-rickshaw driver, 35-year-old Jagdesh from Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh, lived in the house for the last two years with his wife, Varsha, and their eight-year-old daughter.The homeowner, Amit, has been booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code, and has been arrested, said Ved Prakash Surya, deputy commissioner of police (north-east). “Jagdesh would drive a rented e-rickshaw to make a living. His wife is a homemaker. During the lockdown, they had not been earning anything, but they didn’t go back to Aligarh as we have no work back home. Jagdesh was expecting work to resume soon,” said a second senior police officer familiar with the case who asked not to be named. They paid a monthly rent of ₹5,000, which included the electricity bill. “Their owner of the house is a blacksmith, and he too hadn’t been earning anything either during the lockdown. He wanted to keep the electricity bills low to save money,” the second officer said. According to the police complaint, at around 7pm on Friday, Amit walked up to Jagdesh’s flat and found his wife using a 100 watt bulb. “He got angry with me for using that bulb. I tried to tell him that I needed more light for cooking, but he removed the bulb and left,” Varsha said to the police in her statement. She also alleged that Amit was drunk at that time, but police could not substantiate this allegation.According to Varsha, Amit returned with a bulb that consumed less power sometime later but began scolding her again. “My husband who was lying down on a broken sofa placed on the terrace at that time asked him not to scream. That made Amit angry. He walked to the terrace and slapped my husband hard,” she alleged. As per the allegations made by Varsha, the slap caused Jagdesh to fall, and his head to hit the wooden armrest of the broken sofa. “He fell unconscious. I sought help from a relative to take him to GTB hospital in his e-rickshaw,” said Varsha in her complaint. Jagdesh succumbed to his injuries on Saturday at the hospital. The police quoted a doctor as saying that he died of head injuries. Amit was arrested shortly afterwards and his statement recorded. According to the police, he said that he wanted to lower power consumption, as he was financially distressed due to slowdown in business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/squabble-over-use-of-100w-bulb-ends-in-tenant-s-death-in-delhi/story-5FxXBCcedbMU3ShjlPQIWM.html
25-05-2020||Delhi||Containment zones to hunger centres, 13k volunteers lend Delhi a helping hand||In November 2019, 26-year-old Dheeraj Kapoor and 33-year-old Naveen Kumar were new civil defence volunteer recruits deployed by the Delhi government at a busy traffic intersection in south Delhi. They were there to ensure that private vehicles with odd and even registration numbers ply on alternate dates adhering to the government’s fortnight-long road space rationing strategy.However, as the authorities eased the restrictions of the nationwide lockdown, implemented to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), with time, the city police reduced its deployment on Covid-19 duty in a phased manner and returned to regular law and order duties. This led to the district administration relying more on civil defence volunteers since May 4, remarked several district magistrates that HT spoke to. There are 13,000 active volunteers on duty. The government needs at least 10,000 more volunteers immediately and at least 25,000 more in the next few months as businesses, commercial activities and public transport resume operations, and the number of positive cases continues to spike, senior government officials said on condition of anonymity.Currently, Kapoor works full-time in one of the 87 Covid-19 containment zones in the city – from manning barricades that seal the area to ensuring doorstep delivery of essential goods. Kumar works in one of the 1,800-odd hunger centres run by the city government, which feeds around 500 people twice a day.“In the last few months, I have witnessed quite an unexpected journey – from manning vehicles on odd-even days and volunteering for election duty to helping victims during the north-east Delhi riots and now Covid-19 management,” Kapoor said over the telephone.“From manning barricades in containment zones and providing essential goods to the residents of sealed areas to distributing ration and cooked meals at hunger centres, helping the police maintain law and order, and ensuring social distancing at railway stations and liquor shops, civil defence volunteers in Delhi have been playing a major role since the day the nationwide lockdown was imposed (March 25),” Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said.Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev said, “In the next few days, we are looking forward to more volunteers joining our ranks as the city resumes normalcy with the functioning of business, commerce and public transport.”There are almost 46,000 volunteers registered with the Delhi government, according to a senior official with the revenue department. They are not bound by an employment contract and are entitled to emolument of around ₹730 for a day’s work when engaged in duty, he said. “Of the 46,000, around 13,000 are active volunteers. Others have not reported for a long time. We have deployed them in containment zones, food distribution centres, screening centres, shelter homes, quarantine centres, etc.,” the official in charge of the civil defence registration process said, requesting anonymity. However, a total of 25,000 volunteers are needed for effective Covid-19 management, he added.The official said that civil defence volunteers are needed throughout the year and the government occasionally publishes advertisements in newspapers to inform potential volunteers of that. The minimum age requirement is 18 years and there is no bar on the maximum age.Delhi currently has a sanctioned strength of 237,938 civil defence volunteers, according to records of the Union home ministry.The recruitment official in Delhi government said, “To ensure social distancing, especially in public transport, the government plans to deploy more volunteers. We need at least 25,000 volunteers in the next few months as more businesses, commercial activities and public transport are expected to further restart operations.”According to Jugal Kishore, the head of the community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, “Community participation plays an important role in public health initiatives. It can help change perception and aid in the effective implementation of rules and regulations for the welfare of the community if the volunteers are trained well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/city-s-civil-defence-volunteers-on-the-frontlines/story-OvWwu4KVDvDLpO11m7C8fK.html
25-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi weekly markets still shut, vendors say ‘lack of clarity’||Even as markets across the city were allowed to open up in a staggered fashion last week, Delhi’s street vendors said a lack of clarity on the state government’s part has kept them from resuming weekly markets. While Delhi government officials said weekly markets could reopen, provided they ensured social distancing, police said civic agencies would need to give them permission.With social distancing now obligatory in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, street vendors’ associations, some resident welfare associations (RWAs) and market associations demand that the government demarcate dedicated vending zones, in accordance with the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014. Usually, vendors in weekly markets usually line up their carts and shops in packed lanes, right next to each other, and attract large crowds, making ensuring social distancing a task.The exact number of weekly markets in the Capital and vendors associated with them is not known. In fact, civic agencies are yet to begin surveys to identify genuine vendors in Delhi as per the Street Vendors Act. Street vendors are still to reopen their shops even in popular markets like Connaught Place, Karol Bagh, Sarojini, Lajpat Nagar. While some vendors in smaller local markets have reopened businesses, confusion is still writ large.Rajiv Kumar Gupta (45), head of a weekly market in east Delhi’s Madhu Vihar, said local authorities have asked them to wait till at least May 31. “There are 100-odd vendors in the weekly market we used to set up in Madhu Vihar, Mandawali, Vinod Nagar and other places across the week. We have now been told to wait till May-end,” Gupta said.While the Delhi government’s order regarding relaxation in lockdown norms in the fourth phase explicitly mentions that markets can open, following an ‘odd-even’ arrangement, it does not mention weekly markets and street vending. However, the order also reads that all commercial and industrial activities that are not specifically prohibited by the guidelines will be allowed in the city. “Everyone is interpreting the order differently. As there is no mention of a ban on street vending or weekly markets, we thought we are allowed to operate. But we have been asked by the police not to start work. The government should have clearly stated the rules for street vending and weekly markets like it has done for markets areas,” said Satish Kumar, a street vendor in Karol Bagh market and a member of the area’s Town Vending Committee.Vendors in Karol Bagh said they are unsure whether they can set the weekly market up on Monday or not. Likewise, vendors in Narela are yet to restart weekly markets.Senior police officers meanwhile said civic agencies needed to permit the operation of weekly markets, and added that the daily restriction on movement between 7pm and 7am would be a hurdle.Deepak Purohit, DCP (west), said, “They haven’t got permission from civic agencies yet. So, only the main shops are opening right now in the manner ordered by the government. But vendors providing essential products like vegetables and fruits were never stopped in the first place.”Monika Bhardwaj, DCP (north), said it is not possible to allow weekly markets since they generally operate in the evening, when complete restrictions on movement, except essential services, are in effect. “They are unable to operate because the lockdown comes into effect at 7pm everyday, which is around the time weekly markets open,” she said.A senior Delhi government official aware of the matter said street vendors can start work, but have to ensure social distancing, and adhere to the odd-even sequence. “As for weekly markets, civic agencies have to devise a mechanism to ensure social distancing,” the official said. Another senior government official said there weekly markets can operate provided social distancing is ensured, but also said it was up to civic bodies to ensure a social distancing mechanism.The National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI) said municipal agencies should start work at developing dedicated vending zones.Arbind Singh, national coordinator, NASVI, said, “The creation of dedicated vending zones in the National Capital is long-pending demand. It should have been done immediately after the Street Vendors Act was passed in 2014, but it is even more important now as social distancing has to be ensured.”The New Delhi Traders Association (NDTA) in Connaught Place has also requested the Delhi government to relocate vendors from the market as it is “impossible to ensure social distancing”, said Atul Bhargava, president, NDTA.RWAs in the city, too, said vendors and weekly markets are important in residential areas, but agreed there was a need to regulate them to prevent the spread of the disease. “We are all interdependent. Weekly markets cater to a large population, but there is a need to regulate them and provide dedicated space,” said Atul Goyal, president of URJA, an association of RWAs in Delhi.Civic agencies, meanwhile, said they are yet to decide on the matter. The North Delhi Municipal Corporation has called a meeting next week to discuss the issue. “Vendors are important and cater to a large population. We have called a meeting to discuss how we can streamline vending in our jurisdiction and ensure social distancing, especially in weekly markets,” Jai Prakash, standing committee chairman, north corporation.The South Delhi Municipal Corporation’s mayor Sunita Kangra said, “It is difficult to maintain social distancing in weekly markets. We are not planning to give permission to weekly markets immediately. But we are trying to work out a way so that these markets can operate while ensuring social distancing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lack-of-clarity-social-distancing-troubles-keep-delhi-s-weekly-markets-from-resuming-business/story-qH3IvkHx0V3ZhD4pFS58FK.html
25-05-2020||Delhi||No quarantine for asymptomatic passengers landing at IGI airport||New Delhi: The Delhi government has decided to go with the Centre’s standard operating procedure (SOP) for domestic flights arriving at the Indira Gandhi International Airport from Monday, when operations resume in parts of the country. This means passengers who land in the National Capital and are asymptomatic will not require quarantine or isolation. On Sunday, Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev issued an order directing all concerned authorities to “ensure compliance” to guidelines issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare.The annexed guidelines in the order — which HT has seen — said, “Asymptomatic passengers will be permitted to go with the advice that they shall self-monitor their health for 14 days. In case they develop any symptoms, they shall inform the district surveillance officer or the state/national call centre (1075).”It said, “Those found symptomatic will be isolated and taken to the nearest health facility. They will be assessed for clinical severity in the health facility. Those having moderate or severe symptoms will be admitted to dedicated Covid health facilities and managed accordingly. Those with mild symptoms will be given the option of home isolation or isolated in a Covid care centre…”Though the Centre allowed states to prepare their own SOPs, the Delhi government chose to abide by the guidelines broadly drafted by the Union ministry, Dev confirmed on Sunday.Several states have rolled out stricter rules for arriving passengers. Karnataka, for instance, will mandatorily quarantine people coming from worst-affected states, while Himachal Pradesh and Mizoram said they will allow only residents who were stranded elsewhere to return. Maharashtra, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu had till Saturday opposed the decision to restart flights. On Sunday, aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri and officials from his department held several meetings with other states to convince them to allow services to resume. For departures, Delhi has drafted protocol that covers areas including the airport entrance, the area outside the terminal, baggage scanning, check-in, security check and waiting area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-quarantine-for-asymptomatic-passengers-landing-in-delhi/story-2BXRGIqKkgL0fQJwoByKOK.html
25-05-2020||Delhi||First case of Covid-19 in Tihar Jail as assistant superintendent tests positive||The first case of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Tihar prison complex was reported on Saturday. An assistant superintendent of Jail Number 7 tested positive for the virus on Saturday, prison officials said. The official had got himself tested on Friday. The prison’s director-general Sandeep Goel said, “His test results arrived Saturday. He was asymptomatic but the test results showed he had the virus.” The official lives in the staff residential complex near the prison. “Contact tracing at his workplace (Jail No.7) and residence is complete. It has revealed one member of the jail staff as a close contact and five others as casual contacts. The five casual contacts include two prison officials and three jail inmates,” Goel said. At least nine residents (all prison officials) of the residential complex where the officer lives have also been told to quarantine themselves at home. Jail officials said that after the contact tracing process was over, the close contact was tested for Covid-19. His result is awaited. He is quarantined at home. The two casual contacts (members of the jail staff) are also quarantined at home. Meanwhile, the three inmates (casual contacts) have been kept in the isolation barrack. The prison department has turned single cells inside the prison into isolation wards. According to jail authorities, new prisoners are lodged in a separate sub-jail (number 2) for 14 days. They are shifted to other parts of the jail and allowed to lodge with other prisoners after completing the 14-day quarantine period. Goel said that all the contacts are presently asymptomatic and their medical condition will be monitored. This is the first case inside the Tihar prison complex, which is also the most crowded prison in the country. Until the nationwide lockdown, implemented on March 25, Tihar had around 13,000 prisoners. Currently, there are around 9,500 prisoners. As part of the measures to decongest the prison, the government released around 3,000 prisoners on interim bail and parole. The prison department has also cancelled the biweekly visit of inmates’ families to contain the spread of the virus. With the lower courts closed, the prisoners’ hearings are held via video conferencing from prison. Rohini jail, which has around 1,200 prisoners, has reported 18 Covid-19 cases, while Mandoli jail, where around 3,000 prisoners are lodged, has one case so far. In all the 20 Covid-19 cases found in the three jails, all the patients remain asymptomatic, according to jail authorities. All jail superintendents are on high alert after learning how the virus spread rapidly inside Mumbai Arthur Road jail, leading to at least 180 officials testing positive within a week, even though the jail houses less than 4,000 prisoners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/first-case-of-covid-19-in-tihar-jail-as-assistant-superintendent-tests-positive/story-o8o3Tn7f5da0OutxWzqKqK.html

This is despite the fact that the police and clerics all over the district had previously mutually decided to forgo the festivities this time.Places of worship in Gautam Budh Nagar had closed down even before the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24. Section 144 of the CrPC has also been implemented in the district, under which the gathering of more than four people is banned.However, to ensure that there are no violations, the district police remain vigilant.“We are on alert, and extra force and QRTs have been deployed all across the district. However, we do not anticipate any issues. We had met the clerics before alvida jumma (last Friday of Ramzan) and they believe that in the current scenario, festivities must take a back seat,” deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Sankalp Sharma said.The commissioner of police had also visited mosques and met clerics on Friday to assess the precautions being taken. Shops around Jama Masjid in Sector 8, Noida’s largest mosque, remain closed as they are part of a containment zone. The police are encouraging people to follow the norms of social distancing. “The priority right now is for the country to overcome this pandemic. No prayers are being offered at the masjid for over two months now and we are asking the public to celebrate eid at home,” Salim, a cleric at the Nithari masjid, said.The district has more than 140 mosques and shrines; there are around 40 in the city area and more than 100 in Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/eid-in-lockdown-cops-on-alert/story-TEONVdvo7zhUt4MyYr58kJ.html
25-05-2020||Noida||Realtors to employ migrant workers returning home, submit proposal||The Uttar Pradesh (UP) government has accepted a proposal by real estate developers to employ thousands of migrant labourers who have returned from other states to their home towns in UP due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic . Developers can engage 2.5 lakh labourers at various construction sites in different cities in the state, including Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway. The state government has already approved a detailed proposal submitted by the national real estate development council (NAREDCO) to turn into reality chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s promise of creating jobs for at least 50 lakh workers, who have returned to their respective home towns. The developers want the state government to support their plan to “revive the sector” facing unprecedented economic challenges.“We have requested the state government to support our plan of employing at least 2.5 labourers at various construction sites in different cities across the state. We demand that the state government should stop imposing stamp fee on buyers who wants to purchase flats in the next one year, reduce circle rates, give extra time to repay housing cost dues, along with other benefits,” said RK Arora, Uttar Pradesh president of NAREDCO, a developers’ group.The developers are likely to meet the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to submit their proposal regarding the restructuring of their business loans, reduction of interest rates on home loans to customers, and a reduction of interest rates to project loans to developers, along with a host of other demands.“We have requested both the state and Centre to take steps to revive the real estate sector. We will seek assistance from Centre and request the state government to accept some of our demands,” said Arora.In Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway, there are at least 600 ongoing realty projects. A total sum of ₹50,000 crore has been invested in these projects by thousands of homebuyers, as per an estimate given by developers. “If the state government declares a zero period for a year in the state for real estate sector, then this sector will retain jobs and also create new ones. We are sure the state government will help the sector as it helps in job creation,” said Harendra Yadav member of NAREDCO. A zero period means extending a time period of one year to repay financial dues and not impose any interest for the same period. At least 60% of 2.5 lakh labourers will be engaged at different sites in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas. The remaining labourers will be provided jobs in other cities including Ghaziabad, Meerut and Lucknow.The developer said that if the government will give us an additional time to finish and deliver ongoing projects and extend the validity of a sanctioned map then it will help in giving work to labourers.“Most of the labourers at our sites have left for their respective cities because they were desperate to return homes,” said Prashant Tiwari, president of Western UP confederation of real estate developers association of India (CREDAI), another developers group.The developers said that they will employ the labourers, who have returned back to their respective home towns in Uttar Pradesh and those who are in need of jobs.“We can train unskilled labourers and engage them in work easily at our sites. We will set up training centres at the sites, skill them and employ them. Skilling the mason, the bar bender and the security worker does not require much time,” said Arora.“Our government is committed to provide jobs to those who have returned to their homes. Employing these workforce is a priority and the developers’ plan is productive as it will engage people in different jobs. The state government will soon take this proposal to the next level and will do the needful,” said Satish Mahana, UP industry minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/realtors-to-employ-migrant-workers-returning-home-submit-proposal/story-259DkOmZCQXhInFlRFDa5L.html
25-05-2020||Noida||Liquor sellers demand relaxations from government||Liquor sellers of Noida — citing losses due to the extended closure of shops owing to the lockdown — have appealed to the state government for relaxations in license fee for the days shops were shut. The liquor store owners have also alleged that they were being compelled to buy a minimum fixed quota of liquor.A letter addressed to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, which has been signed by 63 liquor store owners of Gautam Budh Nagar, stated that liquor vends had been facing losses, especially in the countrymade liquor category. The excise department, however, has been compelling them to pick up stocks on par with that of last year, despite a low demand. The sellers further also demanded that the basic licence fee of all shops should be refunded for the days during which they were shut for the lockdown. Some stores, they said, continue to remain shut in the containment zones.“Liquor shops had been facing losses, as number of customers have dropped. Yet we are being compelled to pick up stock equal to that of last year. We have already faced losses and thus are not in a position to buy stock more than what we will sell. The major impact is in the county liquor category, whose primary consumers are migrant labourers, most of whom have left for their hometowns,” said a liquor seller .Sellers also stated that while adequate stock and variety of liquor is being ensured, certain premium brands are yet to be supplied.According to officials however, there was no obligation on sellers to maintain a certain amount of stock. Officials said that representatives of state liquor sellers have met officials in Lucknow and handed over a memorandum to the excise commissioner’s office.“There is no such obligation on sellers to buy a certain amount of stock. Also, I am unaware of any demand of reduction in licence duty fee. Representatives of liquor sellers have met senior officials in Lucknow,” said RB Singh, district excise officer.Meanwhile, even as excise officials said that older stock of liquor will be sold at the printed rate, a number of customer complained of over-pricing.“Many vends are selling at prices higher than the maximum retail price (MRP). For a bottle of beer worth Rs 150, they charged Rs 170,”said Kartik Sharma, a Noida-based techie who went to a liquor shop in Sector 43. Another customer at Gheja village said he had to pay Rs 40 over the MRP per beer bottle.“For 180ml white rum, the printed price was Rs 140. But they charged Rs 180. We don’t know who to complain to,” said Avnish Mishra, another Noida resident.Officials, however, said that liquor was being sold not at a higher price but at revised rates.“We have not found any such cases of liquor being sold at price higher than the MRP. The new stock coming from the distilleries have updated MRP, while the stock supplied with old price was updated by the sellers as directed by the department. Most of the sellers were also asked to paste a new sticker with fresh rates,” said RB Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/liquor-sellers-demand-relaxations-from-government/story-HILtt4RXbqJI4TP74oy5JK.html
25-05-2020||Gurugram||Eid under lockdown: Residents skip shopping, help migrants with food||With the country set to celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr on Monday, Muslims in the district, are preparing to mark the festival in a muted manner with restriction in place due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In a departure from the usual norm, the festival will take place without mass congregation prayers as mosques remain closed in view of the ongoing lockdown.Eid-ul-Fitr marks the end of the fasting month of Ramzan and is expected to be a low-key affair this time with people planning to stay at home and celebrate with immediate family members. While restrictions having eased considerably in the current phase of the lockdown, most people said that they were either planning to stay indoors or spend time sharing food and resources with people belonging to lesser privileged sections of the society.Arshad, a Nuh resident, said that the usual excitement surrounding the festival was missing due to the threat of the pandemic.“We have not done any Eid shopping this year. Family members, including children, will be wearing their old clothes. These are tumultuous times but throughout the month of Ramzan, people made the efforts to take care of each other. Fruits and water have been arranged daily for migrants who are crossing the region. We are planning to continue with the practice on Eid as well,” said Arshad, who goes by his first name.Mohd Arif, a social worker, has been distributing food and ration kits to people travelling back home to their states on the KMP (Kundli-Manesar-Palwal) Expressway since the past week. “We are preparing vegetarian biryani for distribution among those who travelling back home and providing them with a food kit for the rest of their journey. The food kit includes grams, biscuits, and energy drinks. We are also providing them with masks and Dettol,” said Arif.Arif said that Eid too would be spent catering to the needs of people and providing them with food and water in the heat. “People have been walking on foot to reach their villages in other states. They are in dire circumstances and helping them will remain our priority even on Eid,” said Arif. He said that other residents were also pitching in with support and providing bananas and water bottles to passers-by.Rakshanda Fatima, a resident of Sector 52, said that the biggest change this year would be people performing Eid namaz at home. “We will be performing the Eid prayers at home this year. There will be no going out and meeting friends. No parties,” said Fatima, who usually travels to her home town Lucknow for the festival but would not be doing so due to the lockdown.She said that venturing out was too risky with new containment zones being notified every other day. “In our neighbourhood, a society was recently declared as a containment zone. The best precaution is to stay at home. We have not stepped out for Eid shopping either. There is a no point,” she said.Mufti Mohammed Saleem Qasmi, president of the Gurugram unit of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, has appealed to residents and asked them to celebrate the festival at home with family. “The circumstances this year are different. We are under lockdown conditions due to which there are restrictions. Some shops have opened up with the easing of restrictions, but we need to remember that shops have been opened for necessary purchases and we should not indulge in unnecessary shopping. The month of Ramzan was marked with simplicity this year and we should continue the same practice for Eid,” said Qasmi.Qasmi said that with mosques not being open to the public, Eid prayers could be offered at home as per norms with family members. “People should at home and spend time with family members. We should ensure that people do not step out unnecessarily at the cost of health. In the absence of the requisite number of people needed for Eid namaz, people could offer Chasht namaz,” said Qasmi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/eid-under-lockdown-residents-skip-shopping-help-migrants-with-food/story-UmkeciHC065dvqXDvQiFcP.html

Your false bravado will then crumble and you will have to face the music.”Dhillon challenged Ashu to come out with a statement agreeing to the audit of the entire food stock as well as stocktaking by a central team.“It is obvious that you have recorded thousands of disbursal, which never took place. The stock of wheat and pulses has been shifted to residences of Congress leaders and now you are afraid of the evidence of this atrocity against the suffering poor coming out in the open. That is why, you are trying to divert the attention of the people with holier-than-thou attitude.”Dhillon, appealing to Paswan to order an inquiry into the scam, said the central ministry was already abreast of the fact that the state ministry had distributed only 1% of the food material received from the centre in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sad-seeks-probe-into-distribution-of-food-material-sent-as-central-relief-to-punjab/story-ClcBCHDSnUlkWAK5jYVL2K.html

I have also been providing free face masks to the people who are visiting my clinic since the lockdown.”“We saw it appropriate to distribute free masks apart from educating the people to make it a habit at their workplaces or whenever venturing out of their homes for some emergency work,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-lockdown-city-based-ngos-distribute-face-masks-in-ludhiana/story-kKQekuaZEkc4fY8EZREigL.html
25-05-2020||Pune||Most shops in Pune fail to clock-in 12 hours of business, down shutters by 4pm||The city is slowly limping back to normalcy during lockdown 4.0 with major relaxations in place in non-containment zones for resumption of businesses, however, shop owners are preferring to down their shutters before the 7pm deadline.The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has given permission for non-essential shops to operate in non-containment zones between 7am and 7pm, but many are preferring to close it by 4pm either due to the instructions of police officials or on their own.Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad admitted that the administration has been getting complaints from shop owners about their establishments being asked to close down by 4pm. “I have been getting at least four to five complaints every day and I pass them on to the police commissioner for appropriate action.”Owner of Ramesh Supermarket, a grocery shop off Pune-Satara road, said that while the PMC order clearly states that shops can remain open till 7pm, police officials ask them to shut shop by afternoon. “We have been closing our shop by 3pm according to the order by police officials.” The owner, however, refused to share his name.Like Satara road, where most essential and non-essential shops except medical stores are shut by 4pm despite the 7pm order, the scene is no different at NIBM road.Police commissioner K Venkatesham said that the orders are clear. “Nobody will close shops unless they want to close on their own. If they are asked to close their shops before time, they can complain on the number 100. The shop owners can also communicate with us on 89752 83100, which is the control room WhatsApp number.”There is, however, a mixed response in major parts of Kothrud, where shops are open till 7pm on the main streets while establishments on internal roads close by afternoon. Gift articles and clothes shop owner at Paud road, Ramesh Parmar, said, “I keep my shop open from 10:30am to 7pm, but I do not get many customers these days.”The market at Paramhansnagar in Kothrud still wears a deserted look as most of the shops are yet to open. “I feel like I am starting my business from scratch, again. Shops around my establishment are yet to open,” owner of an automobile repairing centre said.Fattechand Ranka, president of Pune Vyapari Mahasangh, however, puts into perspective another reason why the shops might prefer closing earlier. “The main reason why shops are closed by police officials at 5pm is because staffers who are working at the respective shops need to reach home before 7pm as there is curfew. If they keep working till 7pm, how will they reach home before the curfew starts?” said Ranka.In Baner, which has seen very less number of Covid-19 areas, life is back to normal as most of the shops are open till 7pm.“It is good to see other shops opening up as it keeps the roads busy and the charm of Baner road is coming back,” owner of the Jayshree grocery shop said. “I wanted to purchase a scarf from a shop located on Karve road which was at 11am. However, I already had two bags of groceries and I decided to buy the scarf in the evening at 5pm, but when I came back, the shop was closed, Other shops were also closed,” said Pranita Wagh, who stays in Karvenagar.The early closure of shops may not be in consonance with PMC’s proposal to extend the public movement further till 11 pm. During a meeting with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday, the PMC commissioner said that the curfew relaxation can be extended till 1pm after May 31 when lockdown 4.0 ends. “We will decide as per the government order post May 31,” said Gaikwad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/most-shops-in-pune-fail-to-clock-in-12-hours-of-business-down-shutters-by-4pm/story-AmD9ZCELTXxEgwMT2KdRAL.html

25-05-2020||Pune||Flying instructor booked for sexual harassment in Baramati||A flying instructor at a Baramati based aviation institute was booked for sexual harassment by Pune rural police, an official said on Sunday. The accused, according to police, is a certified flight instructor working with the academy. The complaint was first raised in February this year, by a 20-year-old student who was undergoing training at the institute. Her complaint led to another girl coming forward with a similar complaint during the same month against the instructor.“As per Vishaka guidelines, an internal complaints committee (ICC) was appointed and they have received complaints from two students so far. Due to the lockdown, the proceedings were put on hold. However, the ICC will conduct a due process,” said Hemlata Nilakhe, human resource official at Carver institute where the instructor works.According to the complainant, when she first spoke up against the instructor, it was forwarded to the senior level.“The institute officials later started asking me whether I wanted to raise the issue and make it big or end it here. I got scared at that point,” said the 20-year-old.As per the complainant, during a training session on February 2 and February 3, the accused held her hand while she was training to fly an aircraft solo. He kept repeating the misbehaviour during daily sessions and touched her thighs before she told him that she was uncomfortable, according to the complaint.On February 5, the accused allegedly touched her chest which prompted her to raise the issue with other staff.“I was asked to do a preliminary inquiry. My inquiry purpose was only fact-finding. Two girls had spoken to me. The second girl’s complaint was on a day when the institute was shut. There was insufficient proof about the claims made by the complainant as well. I had suggested further inquiry in their claims,” said deputy superintendent Aishwarya Sharma, sub-divisional police officer, Daund division of Pune rural police, who spoke to the girls before the case was registered.“Only the flight on February 2 was logged. But I have proof that flights happened on February 3, 4, and 5 as well even though they were not logged in. Unlogged flying is a common practice as long as a certified instructor is with you,” said the complainant.“There was a third girl as well. She was taken back home by her parents after she reported the incident. Even on days when the institute is shut, practice sessions can take place,” said a source from the institute.A case under Section 354(a) (sexual harassment) of Indian penal code was registered at the Baramati police station on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/flying-instructor-booked-for-sexual-harassment-in-baramati/story-l3HLLjpFZeKyx2soKvN4aJ.html
25-05-2020||Pune||Pune police ensure Satara road’s pre-dawn market is locked down||Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham has ordered local police to patrol and take strict action against people who do not follow social distancing norms. This comes after HT, on May 23, reported how social distancing norms were flouted on a portion of Satara road which has turned into a full-fledged wholesale market during the wee hours.After Market Yard shut its operations hundreds of traders and retailers dealing in the sale of vegetables, fruits, food grains and other commodities come to the Satara road market that begins at 3 am and closes by dawn.Accordingly on Sunday when HT visited Satara road at 5am, a change of picture was noticed. While earlier the traders parked their vehicles on both sides of the road from Laxminarayan chowk to Padamavati chowk, on Sunday, no trucks were seen. Though 10-15 vehicles came to unload their materials, the police officials present on the spot, did not allow them to do so.Though the traders moved from Satara road, they shifted their business to other connecting roads like Bibvewadi road. It was only after the police intervened, that the traders moved out.“It is unfortunate that people are coming out in large numbers and no maintaining distance. Despite efforts of the frontline workers, the virus will be hard to defeat, if such activities continue to take place. Overcrowding is a risk to everyone’s life. The civic body must give the traders an alternate arrangement to carry out their business. It’s good that police department has now started taking action on them.” said Preetam Gandhi, chairman of Vishwagandha housing society, Satara road.Jivan Mahadik, a wholesale trader said, “We are also helpless and do not want to risk our lives, but we do not have any other option, than to stand on the road and sell goods. If government gives us alternate option to park the vehicles and do our trading business then it will be a great help to us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/police-ensure-satara-road-s-buzzing-morning-market-is-ground-to-a-halt/story-5t5FZLnJDtYyAhrYDcvbSM.html
25-05-2020||Pune||Akurdi Pradhikaran residents protest quarantine facility in green zone||Residents of Akurdi Pradhikaran in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) have strongly opposed the civic body quarantining people in an educational institute located in the densely populated residential area. Pradhikaran is a green zone, so locals do not want their area affected now due to the PCMC’s action.Local corporators, Raju Misal of the NCP and Amit Gawade from the Shiv Sena, along with residents from the area, staged a protest on Saturday and Sunday in front of the Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering, sector 26, Akurdi Pradhikaran. Protestors put beds in front of the gate of the college and spent the night there. The civic body has quarantined 14 people inside the campus. These quarantined people belong to the Anandnagar slums located in Chinchwad, a red-zone belt.PCMC commissioner Shravan Hardikar said, “The opposition in the Akurdi Pradhikaran area is wrong because it’s a question of the entire city. They should co-operate with us. We have taken all the necessary precautions while quarantining people in their locality.” The PCMC, as of May 24, has recorded 324 positive Covid-19 cases.Raju Misal said, “The civic body did not inform us corporators before shifting these people. The people in our locality, for the last two-and-a-half months, have been strictly following social distancing and taking necessary precautions so our area falls in a green zone. PCMC should shift these people to a school located in Anandnagar.”Misal added, “After PCMC lifted its lockdown, on Saturday, 49 cases were reported, so there are chances of Covid-positive cases increasing. PCMC should use the Gahunje stadium as a quarantine centre. I have also informed deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.”Sunil Patil, a resident of Prakashgad cooperative housing society, said, “Our society is located exactly besides the college. We are really worried after PCMC quarantined people besides our home.”Sumati Dole, another resident said, “All retired government people are living here. The college is located in the middle of densely populated housing societies. Who will take care of us? Why is the civic body allowing red-zone people in our green zone belt?” Suraj Karnik, also a resident, said, “Almost 90% people here are above the age of 60 and their immunity is low, so there is more risk. There are nearly 10,000 people in Akurdi-Pradhikaran. PCMC has made a 600-bed provision inside the college. We request the civic body to quarantine these people somewhere else.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/akurdi-pradhikaran-residents-protest-quarantine-facility-in-green-zone/story-gM4ShQtFR77hChZyfDQ1mO.html
25-05-2020||Pune||Pune’s observation homes for children get counselling via videoconferencing in Covid times||PUNE The observation and special homes for children in conflict with law (CCL) and children in need of care and protection (CNCP) have found solace in video conferencing and art since school and regular interaction sessions have come to a standstill during the Covid-19 (coronavirus) lockdown.While children in the special homes are juvenile convicts, the ones in the observation home are juvenile undertrials. According to Section 1 (14) of Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Act 2015, children in need of care and protection are homeless, abused, destitute and missing children.The lockdown brought about major changes in the prison as well as correctional home systems all over the country. In an effort to prevent the spread of the virus within the prison and correctional facilities, a state-level high-powered committee had recommended directions for decongestion.The Jawaharlal Nehru Udyog Kendra observation and special home for boys in Yerawada had around 40 children. However, after decongestion, the observation home now has five while the special home has seven children, including two adults, in the facility.“These five are here because of unavoidable reasons. We could have sent them all home but one is from Delhi, two are orphans and one has only one parent who is also in prison,” said GN Padghan, probation officer of the Yerawada facility.Another facility called the Government Observation, Special and Children’s Home for Girls houses seven girls at its campus in Mundhwa. While most inmates in the boys’ facility are juvenile delinquents, the girls’ facility is currently home to six children in need of care and protection and one juvenile delinquent.Counselling, which forms an important part of the rehabilitation for these children is now being done through video conference.“Earlier, when the strength was more, there used to be constant scuffles. With less children, the disturbances are also less. Whenever required, if a child seems like he needs it, counsellors are called through video conferencing,” said Padghan.“They have access to one computer with Internet. Painting and sculptures are made daily. Since the school sessions stopped, the girls have made more than 100 pieces of art,” said Vaishali Navale Tribhuvan, uperintendent at the Girls Observation, Special, and Children’s Home, Mundhwa.Tribhuvan said the girls are very sharp and creative. “Counselling through video conferencing is a part of their routine life now. Various officials conduct counselling sessions,” she said.Along with counselling, the boys also receive online sessions on subjects like stress management, self-respect and gratitude, and importance of mental health.“We hold casual chats with them along with sessions. We call resource persons like art-based therapists and psychologist to speak with the children,” said Zaid Sayyed, social worker with the Resource Cell for Juvenile Justice (RCJJ), a field action project by the Centre for Criminology and Justice of the Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS).The project is operational in facilities in Mumbai, Pune, Yavatmal, and Amravati.“Earlier we had continuous classes and one movie per week. Now we select and show movies almost every day so that their afternoons are spent in a constructive way. In the evening we let them play in the open ground. Some take active interest in helping in the kitchen; some are involved in the in-house organic garden, and some in the carpenter workshop,” said Padghan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/counselling-by-video-conferencing-at-pune-s-observation-homes-for-children/story-WrGRRkb8kXhHBQb6zNHIwO.html
