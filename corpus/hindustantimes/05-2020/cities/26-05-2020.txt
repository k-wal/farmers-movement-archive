26-05-2020||Chandigarh||HT explainer: Are Chandigarh schools within their rights to charge tuition fees||As parents of students in at least five Chandigarh schools protest against charging of tuition fees given the Covid-19 lockdown and suspension of classes, the institutes insist on being paid to cover expenses, including staff salaries, even as the UT education department refuses to mediate between the two, having recently modified its March 29 order that had deferred payment of fees. Let’s find out what exactly is going on over here.Why are parents protesting?The parents’ protest started last week after the education department, on May 18, allowed the schools to charge tuition fees every month. Paying fees during the Covid-19 lockdown with most offices closed and businesses shut down is impossible, say parents. They say they are willing to pay only the tuition fee as directed by the administration, but allege that schools have started asking for consolidated fees, with some even demanding advance payment of three months.What do schools say?The Independent Schools Association (ISA), which represents private schools, says around 50 institutes out of 70 will not be able to pay staff salaries if they don’t charge fees. HS Mamik, chairman, ISA, says schools are ‘not-for-profit’ bodies and they cannot sustain without fees. Besides, online classes are continuing even as schools have to pay property tax, electricity and water bills and transportation charges to contractors.Can UT regulate fees?Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director, school education, says under unprecedented circumstances such as the Covid-19 outbreak, the education department can regulate how and how much schools can charge fees. The Punjab Educational Institutions Fee Regulation Act, 2018 confers powers on the UT education department as a fee-regulatory authority to check profiteering among schools. Invoking the same Act, the UT education department asked schools to upload their balance sheets online, which a majority of institutes did not comply with at first. The regulatory body also has not been able to audit school fee in government and private schools in the last two years.Could UT have intervened?The education department could have intervened as a regulatory body. Advocate Pankaj Chandgothia, who has filed a public interest litigation in the Punjab and Haryana high court, says the education department failed to act on multiple complaints by parents in March and April against schools. Also, before allowing collection of fee on March 18, it (department) should have examined the balance sheets of all the schools, which it was mandated to do as a fee regulatory body. The contention of some schools that they do not have money to pay salaries can be genuine, but the balance sheets uploaded by schools show some with surplus funds.What is the impact of HC order?The ISA challenged the March 29 order of the education department deferring payment of school fee during the lockdown, saying schools did not have the money to pay salaries to teachers. The department then modified the (March 29) order and allowed schools to charge tuition fee. The matter was disposed of by the HC as schools’ grievance stood redressed. Unless challenged by parents schools are now well within their right to charge tuition fees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ht-explainer-are-chandigarh-schools-within-their-rights-to-charge-tuition-fees/story-QDomhfT8SHkzBwoYAV1mNO.html
26-05-2020||Chandigarh||51 private schools in Chandigarh put on notice for not uploading balance sheets||In a first, 51 private schools in Chandigarh have been issued show-cause notices for not uploading their income and expenditure details on their websites.The UT education department took this step on Tuesday, while fresh protests were witnessed outside one school against fee collection amid the Covid-19 lockdown. There are 77 private schools in the city, and at least five have seen parents’ protests in the past one week.Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director school education, Chandigarh, said: “Schools have been given a week to clarify as to why should no action be taken against them. After that, the fee regulatory body will convene a meeting, and the schools will be penalised as per provisions of the Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institutions Act, 2016.”According to the Act, which was notified in Chandigarh in 2018, if any unaided educational institution contravenes its provisions, a fine of ₹60,000 to ₹4 lakh can be slapped on it depending on the number of violations and level of the school (primary, middle or secondary).The standoff between the UT education department and private schools started when the administration on March 29 directed the schools to defer the collection of fees during the lockdown period. However, schools said that they won’t be able to pay salaries to their staff unless they are allowed to collect fees. Then, invoking the Act, district education officer Alka Mehta asked schools to upload their balance sheets online.As schools resorted to non-compliance and public pressure mounted, the UT was prompted to initiate action against schools. In fact, some schools that did display their balance sheets showed a surplus running into crores. Nitin Goyal, president, Chandigarh Parents’ Association, said: “Schools are ‘not for profit’ organisations. They are given tax exemptions. Why should they conceal their balance sheets? Parents are also stakeholders, and should be aware of the institute’s income and expenditure.”HS Mamik, president, Independent Schools Association, raising “privacy concerns” said, “The department has all the balance sheets in its possession. Why does it want us to upload them on a public platform ?” Also, slamming the show-cause notices issued by the UT, Mamik said: “It is beyond my comprehension as to why the department in these difficult times has decided to move collectively against 51 schools.”Vijaya Sidhu, principal of St Soldier International School, Sector 28, where parents held a protest against collection of fee on Tuesday, did not respond to calls despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/51-private-schools-in-chandigarh-put-on-notice-for-not-uploading-balance-sheets/story-ENWrCxk8BSllxL6cCitogO.html

26-05-2020||Mumbai||Five wards of Mumbai see more than 100 Covid deaths||Five wards of Mumbai, which cover areas such as Kurla, Bandra (East), Mankhurd, Govandi, Andheri West, Jogeshwari, Byculla and Mumbai Central, have reported more than 100 Covid-19 related deaths each, according to the civic body’s data. However, officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation said while the deceased had tested positive for the virus, the death audit committee is yet to certify if the death was caused due to Covid-19 or other underlying conditions.As of Tuesday, 1,065 deaths in Mumbai have been certified as Covid-19 deaths, according to the state health department. The city saw 1,002 cases and 39 deaths on Tuesday, bringing the case count to 32,974 and toll to 1065. While the data for Tuesday for the five wards wasn’t released at the time of going to press, as of Monday, L ward (Kurla) had 154 Covid-related deaths, E ward (Byculla and Mumbai Central) had 129, K -west (Andheri West, Jogeshwari and Oshiwara) 103, M-East (Govandi) had 108 and H-East (Bandra East, Santacruz E) had 116 deaths.Padmaja Keskar, chief of the BMC’s health department, said, “Once we get the data on the number of deaths, the death audit committee scrutinises and certifies the death as Covid-19 death, after which they are reflected in the toll.”As of Monday, of the 1,026 deaths in the city, 67% had comorbidities. While 26% had diabetes, 24% hypertension; 32% both diabetes and hypertension; 8% had heart diseases, and 10% other comorbidities. The five wards accounted for around 7,800 cases by Monday. Topping the list was E Ward (1,726 cases), followed by L ward (1,689 cases), H-East (1,680 cases), K-West (1,623 cases) and M-East ward with more than 1,150 cases. The wards are densely populated, cover more areas and have a high number of slum pockets. The numbers are in contrast to G-North and G-South wards that cover areas such as Worli, Prabhadevi, Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim and have more than 3,000 cases, but less than 100 deaths.Manish Valanju, assistant municipal commissioner of L ward, said, “As per the 2011 census, the ward has a population of 9 lakh. A majority of the deceased are senior citizens or those having other ailments. We have screened 60,000 senior citizens so far and are screening more.”Another BMC official from M-East ward said, “The ward is densely populated like L Ward, and a huge chunk of population has other ailments. There have been several incidents of crowding, especially during night hours, when shopkeepers used to open shops, after which curbs were brought in.”Iqbal Chahal, BMC commissioner, on Tuesday held a video-conference where he spoke about bringing the mortality rate on a par with the national average. Chahal said, “Our mortality rate earlier was very high, but now we are working towards maintaining it close to the national average of less than two per cent. Our mortality rate currently is 3.2 per cent.”Chahal has asked the BMC officials to trace and quarantine at least 15 people in slum areas. Aneesh Makwana, BJP corporator from Andheri, said, “More and more people need to be traced and screened everywhere. Also, many are not getting beds on time, which aggravates the condition. The BMC needs to work on it, if the city is yet to hit the peak.”Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a Mumbai-based health consultant with a private hospital, said, “The number of deaths in every part of the city depends on the number of citizens that are being screened or tested there. One needs to detect patients at an early stage, considering there are several reasons behind citizens having symptoms or otherwise not coming forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/five-wards-of-mumbai-see-more-than-100-covid-deaths/story-GJJHFOJNJJTH1ZNtH8ZsZI.html

Division Number 8 station house officer (SHO) inspector Jarnail Singh said the victim had separated from her husband a year go and filed for divorce. Her two children — a seven-year-old boy and a five-year-old daughter — were living with her.“After the lockdown was imposed in the city, she had sent her son to her parents’ home, while taking care of her daughter herself. While leaving for duty, she used to send her daughter to a day care centre at Hambran Road and pick her up in the evening,” said the SHO.“On Monday around 7 PM, Kamaljit called up the owner of the day care centre, asking her to save her as she had taken the extreme step.

26-05-2020||Chandigarh||Change in testing strategy has led to spike in Covid-19 cases at Chandigarh’s Bapu Dham Colony||The change in testing strategy at Bapu Dham Colony in Chandigarh’s Sector 26 has led to a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases, which has prompted the authorities to shift around 142 people from the containment zone to the quarantine facility at Panjab University.Till May 22, only family contacts of infected people were being tested, while those living in the same building in this congested colony were just quarantined and sampled only if they developed symptoms.After finding fault with this strategy, as even asymptomatic contacts started testing positive, the UT administration decided to test all residents living in the same building as those found positive for infection.While between April 24 (when the first case was reported in the colony) and May 22, 147 cases had come to the fore, 59 people have tested positive in just four days (May 23-26), pointing to the administration’s failure to check the spread of infection. As on May 26, the colony accounts for 74% of the city’s 279 confirmed cases and all but two of the 88 active cases.“In some cases, even family contacts were not tested on time as they were asymptomatic. They were quarantined in their homes in the colony, which is densely populated,” said a senior official of the UT health department, while admitting that the recent spurt is on expected lines.Even though the option of institutional quarantine was available to isolate the unaffected population, the administration missed to act on time. The large-scale institutional quarantine facility was pressed into service only on May 23, where till now 142 residents have been moved.Commenting on the delay, UT adviser Manoj Parida said it is neither possible not desirable to shift the entire population from the colony, adding that the “decisions are dynamic and need-based”.“Earlier, we had isolated a few contacts of positive cases at the community centre in Sector 47 and a few other places. As we have not witnessed any big outbreak, say in thousands, we are now using it only for non-affected neighbours who have small houses,” he said. Quarantine sampled people at GMSH, GMCH: BadnoreMeanwhile, in the daily Covid-19 review meeting on Tuesday, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore expressed satisfaction over the substantial increase in testing of samples in Bapu Dham Colony. He also suggested that people whose samples have been taken can be quarantined in Government Multi Specialty, Sector 16, and Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, till their test results are received.Parida said test results of samples collected from different areas have been analysed, and necessary review of boundaries of containment zone and buffer zone will be done as per the directions received from the Centre.Badnore, too, clarified any relaxation is only possible after lapse of specific number of days from the last positive case. He also directed municipal commissioner KK Yadav to ensure regular sanitisation of containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/change-in-testing-strategy-has-led-to-spike-in-covid-19-cases-at-chandigarh-s-bapu-dham-colony/story-I3i7APatCe5Y4VOBAVQzBP.html
26-05-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown, Sanitizer and LavKush: Cama Hospital’s newborns||Three babies born to Covid-infected mothers at Cama Hospital were given very unique names —Lockdown, Sanitizer, and LavKush. The postnatal Covid ward at the government-run hospital erupted with laughter on Tuesday, when medical staffers got to know about the names. One of the boys has been named Lockdown while a girl was given the name Sanitizer. Another boy child has been named after the mythological characters Lav and Kush – sons of Lord Ram and Sita. The child’s parents have used the national lockdown as a metaphor for the divine couple’s exile from Ayodhya and the birth of their children.“I was strolling around the hospital on my duty when I heard laughter in the corridor. When I asked, the three couples informed us about their decision to name their babies based on the Covid pandemic,” said Dr Aparna Hegde, head of the division of urogynecology at Cama Hospital. These are not the first parents to take inspiration from the Covid-19 outbreak. In the first week of April, a couple in Chhattisgarh named their newborn twins Corona and Covid. In the last week of April, a couple from Uttar Pradesh named their child Lockdown. Since the outbreak of the virus in Mumbai, over 400 babies have born to infected mothers. BYL Nair and Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital (Sion hospital) recorded delivery of over 100 healthy uninfected babies from Covid positive mothers.“It’s a tough situation for couples who are expecting. The trend of naming their newborns after the pandemic was also seen in China. It’s actually like a souvenir for the parents to remind them how they fought with the deadly virus and won against it for their children,” said Dr Sagar Mundada, a city psychiatrist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-sanitizer-and-lavkush-cama-hospital-s-newborns/story-SdINCEWlpvMOhY7D5qsABJ.html

26-05-2020||Mumbai||KEM Hospital allows release of staffer’s body 3 days after death||The body of a class-IV employee of civic-run King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Parel has been lying in the morgue of the hospital for the last three days. On Tuesday, when hospital workers protested, the authorities decided to release the body as a suspected Covid victim. His family has now blamed the hospital for being negligent and not testing him earlier.The 45-year-old victim worked at KEM for the last 10 years and was posted in a Covid ward at the hospital. On May 20, he developed a fever and cold. When he informed the doctors, they allegedly did not pay heed and his condition started deteriorating. “On May 24, he started having trouble breathing and before he could reach the hospital, he died. Despite having the symptoms, the hospital didn’t admit him,” said Pradeep Narkar, secretary, Municipal Mazdoor Union.His family has blamed the hospital for being negligent. When asked if the deceased worker was provided with precautionary medicines like HCQ, his sister said, “The medicines are mainly given to permanent employees. The hospital could have saved him if they treated him on time.”As hospitals do not run Covid tests on corpses of suspected patients, authorities could not identify if the victim was Covid positive. “This confused the doctors about his cause of death. However, the hospital has now decided to release the body as a suspected Covid case. Unfortunately, his family members have also tested positive and hospitals are refusing to admit them,” Narkar said. Three employees working in the KEM Hospital morgue have also tested positive. But as alleged by hospital workers, they aren’t given timely treatment and care. “We work in close contact with Covid victims but when we develop symptoms, we aren’t given treatment. We don’t even have insurance as we are not permanent employees of the hospital,” said a hospital worker. Workers held a protest inside the hospital for five hours between 7am and 12pm on Wednesday demanding better safety measures and preventive treatment. “We have demanded treatment for infected staffers at the nearby Mahatma Gandhi Hospital if required,” said Narkar. Dr Hemant Deshmukh, KEM Hospital dean has promised to fill in the gaps and provide alternative accommodation to staffers on Covid duty. “We have discussed their complaints and listened to their concerns. We will meet their demands to provide a better working environment,” he said.25 Kasturba staff test positiveMore than 25 medical staff from Kasturba Gandhi Hospital have contracted Covid-19 through cross-transmission. Of these, 16 are class-IV employees and eight are nurses and midwives. Men working in Covid wards are more exposed to infection as they have not been provided alternative accommodation. They are forced to sleep on empty beds and in corners of the hospital. “Women staffers have been given ward 13 to stay in, but we don’t have any alternative place to reside. We can’t afford to go home as we can end up infecting our family members,” said an employee of the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kem-hospital-allows-for-release-of-suspected-covid-victim-3-days-after-death/story-cmwggzFFY4hxhoM3OIE05L.html

In a letter to his family, dated May 14, he alleged 10 prisoners lodged in the high security ‘anda cell’ barracks of Arthur Road jail have tested positive for Covid-19 and were quarantined in yard number 10. The ‘anda cells’ were created to house criminals in isolation. Mandvikar is in one of these cells.This is the first report of ‘anda cell’ prisoners having contracted the infection.Sunil Ramanand, additional director general of prisons, said, “Dr Rathod of Sir JJ Hospital visits Arthur Road prison almost daily. I will ask him to look into the matter.” Neither Ramanand nor inspector general of prisons Deepak Pandey responded to any other questions.In his letter, written in Marathi, Mandvikar said, “Ten people in anda cells have tested positive. I have also started feeling the symptoms. I am coughing since the past 15 days, but in jail they do not conduct the test using the kits. There are no kits available. They are just providing medicines. I have severe pain in throat.” He asked his family to get his lawyers to arrange for a Covid-19 test for him and another fellow inmate. “Tell the lawyers to obtain an order for my test and to transfer me to a private hospital and Sumeet Bhai. Both of us are not feeling well. We will not get proper treatment here. Proper treatment will be possible only at a private hospital. Don’t waste a single day. We are in major trouble,” Mandvikar wrote in his letter. He also wrote, “Inform the advocate to at least argue in court so that we can get bail for treatment. Once we are okay, we will come back to prison. Do not waste a single day as we are in trouble.”A relative of Mandvikar’s confirmed that they had received the letter. “Another relative visited Sir JJ Hospital twice to see if Harish has been admitted. But we could not find him. We are still not clear how to get in touch or arrange treatment for him,” said the relative.Advocate Prashant Gurav, who is representing Harish, said, “On May 22, a sessions court had given an order for a medical check-up, and to submit a report by May 27. I visited the jail with the roznama and application. But the jail authorities citing Covid-19 did not accept the application physically, and asked me to put the documents in the jail’s drop box.” Gurav said that they had called on a landline number of the Arthur Road prison and also sent an email but did not get a response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/murder-accused-claims-he-is-unwell-no-tests-done-at-arthur-road-jail/story-GvWgb4OHc4izwLnhEtvATO.html

26-05-2020||Mumbai||Submit report on testing facilities in prisons within 2 weeks: HC to state||In an affidavit filed before Bombay high court (HC), Maharashtra prisons said that in order to house each prisoner in a space measuring 40 square feet as per the prison manual, 15,771 inmates would have to be released. The affidavit was filed on HC’s direction, responding to a plea that sought information on the health status of convicts and undertrials in state prisons. It also said three inmates have died of Covid-19 in state prisons so far.Three separate petitions, including one filed by the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), have sought the court’s intervention to decongest state prisons. According to the report on actions taken to contain the spread of Covid-19 in prisons, prison authorities stated that as of May 25, 8,407 inmates have either been released on parole or bail. Prisons are also functioning with half their medical staff at present. The affidavit said also three inmates were asymptomatic carriers who tested positive for Covid-19 after they passed away in May.The authorities did not specify what tests were carried out to identify Covid-positive inmates, which prompted the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice KK Tated to ask prosecutor Deepak Thakare if the inmates of Arthur Road Mumbai Central Jail who may have come in contact with the 158 who tested positive for the infection, have been tested for Covid-19. Arthur Road jail has the highest number of Covid-19 cases among the six prisons in Maharashtra that have reported Covid-positive inmates. The other prisons are in Yerwada, Taloja, Dhule, Satara and Byculla.The court also directed the state to inform relatives of those infected in Arthur Road jail of their health status. The state has been given two weeks to submit a report on testing facilities in all jails.Public prosecutor Deepak Thakare informed the bench through video conferencing that approximately 8,000 inmates out of the 37,000 currently lodged in various jails had been released on interim bail or parole. Another 14,000 would be released once concerned magistrates heard the bail applications. The division bench directed magistrates across the state to expeditiously hear interim bail applications filed by jail authorities.PUCL, represented by senior counsel Mihir Desai, informed the court that relatives and advocates of inmates were anxious as they did not know the health status of those in jail. Thakare said that arrangements for video calling were being made and in the meanwhile, inmates could speak to their family/advocate once a week over telephone.Desai also asked what initiatives have been taken by jail authorities to conduct regular Covid-19 tests among inmates.With regards to money orders for inmates, which have stopped during the lockdown, the state said jail superintendents were asked to open a bank account in their names to allow relatives to deposit money for inmates. The deposited amounts would be disbursed by the superintendents and are meant to buy essential supplies available in the jail store.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/submit-report-on-testing-facilities-in-prisons-within-2-weeks-hc-to-state/story-FF8n40eXoBgDky1Y1x0ThO.html

Also, no new case has been reported in the past 11 days. The last two cases were recorded on May 15, taking the total count to 25.The first positive case in Panchkula was reported on March 21, after a 38-year-old salon worker from Kharak Mangoli village had come in contact with Chandigarh’s first coronavirus patient.

26-05-2020||Delhi||Woman, daughter thrashed by cops, two constables sent to police lines||A woman and her daughter were thrashed with batons for allegedly manhandling policemen who stopped them from constructing a shanty in north-east Delhi’s Shastri Park on Monday night, the police said.The alleged high-handedness by the policemen led to two constables being sent to police lines, which effectively puts them off active policing duties. “We have initiated an inquiry into the incident,” Ved Prakash Surya, the deputy commissioner of police (north-east) said, adding that no first information report (FIR) has been filed against either party. The baton blows and the manhandling that preceded it left the mother-daughter duo and a policeman with injuries. “All three of them received blunt injuries. They are out of danger,” the DCP said. The mother-daughter duo has been identified as Munni Devi and Soni, who live with their family in Shastri Park and work odd jobs. The DCP said that the trigger for the confrontation was a tip that the local police received about some people constructing an unauthorised shanty on government land near the Shastri Park Metro station. “Constables Sanjeev and Jaichand who were patrolling the neighbourhood visited the spot around 9pm and saw the illegal construction. When they asked the people there to stop the construction, Munni Devi and her family members began abusing them,” the DCP said. The officer said that the family didn’t stop the construction and eventually began manhandling the two constables. “They beat up constable Sanjeev and tore his uniform. He had to call his colleagues for help,” the DCP said. A video of the incident, purportedly shot by Munni’s relatives, shows two policemen raining batons on the mother-daughter duo even as other policemen appear to be failing in stopping the assault. Munni and daughter are seen falling on the road and trying to run away from the policemen who continue to chase them even as another woman in the background is heard shouting abuses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/woman-daughter-thrashed-by-cops-two-constables-sent-to-police-lines/story-sJsKl5Xdwgdlg4iItLFF5M.html
26-05-2020||City||Banquet hall owners seek relaxation in norms for social functions||Gurugram:As the business of banquet halls and tent suppliers in Gurugram has suffered badly due to the Covid-19 lockdown, the association of party lawn owners on Tuesday called on the district administration officials and submitted a memorandum demanding an increase in the number of persons allowed in social functions like wedding, which at present is 50. The association has demanded that at least 200 people should be allowed to attend a wedding function.The ongoing wedding season will end on July 15, the association members said, adding that more than 1,000 wedding functions have already been cancelled across the district in the past two months. The association said that at least 20 professions and businesses associated with the wedding industry have suffered a setback, which can only revive if the government relaxes the norm.Apart from over 100 community centres and dharamshalas, there are around 150 banquet halls and 228 registered tent houses in the district, where 30,000 weddings are conducted every year, as per the details shared by the Party Lawns Welfare Association, whose delegation called on the Gurugram deputy commissioner. The association further said that a large number of weddings and other functions are hosted by farmers and other people from April to July. “Around 1,000 wedding functions have already been cancelled and the rest of the season would also go waste, if the administration doesn’t increase the number of people allowed in wedding and other social gatherings,” said Anil Rao, president of the association, adding that the next season will start in November. Rao said that the government should consider allowing 200 to 300 people in a large banquet hall, which is spread over an acre of land. “We are ready to follow all social distancing norms, provide sanitizers, use face masks and stop buffet arrangement for food at the functions. But we need the support of government as the present norm allowing only 50 persons will end our business,” he said.The association has demanded that in June, the number of people allowed in functions should be increased to 200 and next month to 300. “If the number of people allowed in a function is not increased, then not only banquet halls but all trades associated with the industry will suffer badly,” said Ramesh Kalra, a member of the association who was part of the delegation which met the deputy commissioner.The Gurugram administration said that the matter raised by the association pertained to the state government. “This call has to be taken by the state based on the directions issued by the Union ministry of home affairs,” said Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/banquet-hall-owners-seek-relaxation-in-norms-for-social-functions/story-6UMt3JEiOYTtu2Quj9LRSO.html
26-05-2020||Gurugram||GMDA floats tenders to set up a flood control room||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has floated tenders to set up a dedicated flood control room near the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, said officials on Tuesday. Once operational, the control room will serve as a nodal centre from where necessary machines and equipment can be dispersed to waterlogged spots across the city during the monsoon.The development is important as tenders for cleaning drains in the city were only floated in the first week of May this year amid the ongoing lockdown announced to control the coronavirus outbreak. Tenders for cleaning drains in many areas are yet to be floated. Also, in light of many migrant workers returning to their home towns, work in areas where tenders have been allocated is progressing at a slow pace because of a shortage of workers, said officials.The flood control room would be established at a cost of ₹41 lakh. The deadline for submitting the final bid for the tender is June 4.Vikram Singh, executive engineer of drainage division, GMDA, said a meeting on flood preparedness would be held on Wednesday at the authority’s office wherein the exact requirements, in terms of machinery and workforce required, will be determined along with the exact location of the flood control room.“We will establish the flood control room at a location next to the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway from where both parts of the city, those located left of the e-way and those on the right can get adequate and immediate coverage. We will have similar machinery at the flood control office as last year, and will finalise the necessary equipment and workforce size in Wednesday’s meeting. Accordingly, we will ask the potential contractors to meet these requirements,” said Singh.At the flood control room set up in 2019 in Sector 53, GMDA had placed eight dewatering pump sets, four tractor-mounted suction pumps, one earthmover, two super sucker machines, 5,000 gunny bags, and deployed 10 workers who together worked 24x7 in shifts.“Last year, around 45 water logging prone spots were identified by the GMDA. At some of these spots, we have upgraded the drainage system or initiated necessary repairs, and depending on their status report, we will cut down the total number of waterlogging prone spots accordingly for this year,” Singh said. Some of the waterlogging prone spots identified by GMDA include Vatika Chowk, CH Bakhtawar Road, AIT Chowk, and Hero Honda Chowk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-floats-tenders-to-set-up-a-flood-control-room/story-0tOfjlTb9gAFaaeCX4oTeN.html

Our 50 firefighters took around five hours to control the fire,” said Garg.Though the fire officials are yet to ascertain the reason behind the fire, they suspect that it may have started because of a short-circuit. The fire officials said they are still investigating if the factory had violated any fire safety norms.Divisional fire officer( west zone), Mukesh Verma, said the machines used for manufacturing footwear and some plastic materials were kept on the factory’s ground and first floor, while raw materials and the end products were stored on the remaining floors.“The staircase was also blocked with the plastic materials which allowed the fire to spread rapidly and engulf the entire building. Around 10 workers who were inside had safely rushed out before our firefighters reached the spot,” said the divisional officer.He added that three adjacent factory buildings were evacuated as a precautionary step during the firefighting operation.Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya said they were waiting for a complaint from the factory owner regarding the incident. “Further action would be taken accordingly,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/fire-at-footwear-factory-in-keshavpuram-no-injuries-reported/story-4hvxMq1gfyoNVZh2FgctEJ.html

The survey covered nearly two million people in the district of which nearly 100,000 were senior citizens.  The initiative was undertaken by the district administration as the pandemic has mostly affected elderly people with co-morbid conditions. The survey was carried out by teams of 2,700 community health workers, ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers, government employees and local volunteers, along with the help of the police. Yashpal Yadav, deputy commissioner, Faridabad, said, “The teams visited nearly 4.70 lakh houses and covered a population of 20 lakh. We identified 93,703 senior citizens in two days, out of which 336 were suffering from cold, fever and cough. A total of 1,260 people had travel history out of Haryana and 21,276 had a history of blood pressure, asthma, hypertension, tuberculosis and diabetes.”Yadav said samples were collected of the people with symptoms, although their reports are being awaited. The special survey was conducted mainly in the containment zones, which have been declared as Covid-19 hotspots.The survey comes after health experts pointed out that the chances of contracting Covid-19 among senior citizens with co-morbid conditions like hypertension, diabetes, asthma, tuberculosis and heart disease are much higher than others. Six people have succumbed to the infection in the district so far.During the survey, more than 10,000 senior citizens said that the current lockdown has affected their health condition adversely as they are being forced to remain indoors and are unable to go out for their regular walks.The administration has advised people to remain in home isolation after getting their tests conducted.The deputy commissioner further said, “They have placed nine patients under home isolation, who were asymptomatic but positive. We have tested samples of 1,125 people who were close contacts of 214 people who have been tested positive. Additionally, 9,647 people have been placed under home isolation,” he said.The Faridabad Civil hospital has prepared with 100 beds for non-Covid patients and another 300 beds at ESIC Medical College and Hospital.As of Tuesday evening, Faridabad reported twenty-three positive Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 234 in the state, with seventh deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/faridabad-conducts-special-survey-of-2-million-people-to-trace-early-cases-of-covid-19/story-GuMQbje5sUA6VCAwAkX5dN.html
26-05-2020||Delhi||DU delaying formation of governing bodies to shield corrupt officials: Manish Sisodia||Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia wrote to Delhi University (DU) vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi on Monday alleging that the varsity was deliberately delaying the formation of governing bodies (GBs) in 28 Delhi government-funded colleges to shield corrupt officials. Sisodia also asked the varsity to ensure that the process of forming GBs is not delayed to prevent administrative crisis.Vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi did not respond to calls and text messages seeking his comments on the matter. Across colleges, GBs take all decisions for the smooth functioning of a college, including the appointment of teaching and non-teaching staff. The 10-member governing bodies in these colleges have people nominated by both the university and the Delhi government. The tenure of the GBs in 28 Delhi government colleges expired in March 2019. Since then, the Delhi government and the varsity have been at the loggerheads with the DU administration over the issue often leading to a delay in the release of grants to these colleges.“The inordinate delays in constituting the Governing Bodies cannot merely be an act of omission. It now seems like a deliberate attempt to ensure that proper oversight mechanism is not put in place,” Sisodia wrote in the letter to Tyagi on Monday adding that he receives complaints of malpractices and corruption in these colleges.“It seems that the highest functionaries in the University of Delhi seem to be conspiring to protect the perpetrators of corruption. There can be no other reason why such inordinate delays and obstructions have been caused in the formation of these governing bodies and in forwarding the six names sent by the government on March 20 immediately to these colleges,” the letter read.The six names in question became the final bone of contention after DU’s Executive Council recommended sending these names back to the state government for reconsideration on March 13 this year. A week later, the government said that these six names were to be continued.“It was decided that if these names come back, they will be treated as approved and to be sent to the respective colleges. On May 13, university forwarded all names approved by the EC except these six names which are in violation of EC decision. This is not only to delay the process further but also to tilt the balance in the GB formation,” said EC member Rajesh Jha.Pratyush Vatsala, principal of Lakshmibai College, said, “We have started the initial process for the formation of governing bodies. We started contacting the names forwarded by the varsity to take various undertakings. We got the names over ten days ago and it is unlikely that the governing bodies were formed in any of the 28 colleges amid a lockdown.”EC member Rajesh Jha said that many colleges are “buying time on one pretext or the other” over the formation of GBs in all colleges. “This is like a pocket veto. Some colleges are delaying on the trivial pretext of missing phone number or email ids of members. The university is withholding the names of teacher representatives in GB over political consideration,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-delaying-formation-of-governing-bodies-to-shield-corrupt-officials-manish-sisodia/story-kRWq89vcwDHUbZK0jsbPKP.html
26-05-2020||Delhi||One more containment zone in Delhi, tally now 91||The Delhi government on Tuesday sealed parts of Swatantra Nagar Police Colony in Narela after six Covid-19 positive cases were reported from the area in the last few days. This takes the total count of containment zones in the city to 91.According to officials, those who tested positive are relatives of three police personnel deployed in North-west Delhi.District magistrate (north) Deepak Shinde said,“Containment order for Gali number 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A and 5B Swatantra Nagar have been issued after it has been brought to notice that six Covid-19 positive cases have been detected in the area recently. The North Corporation has been directed to thoroughly sanitise the area. Health department surveillance officials have been directed to conduct the survey and sampling of anyone showing influenza-like illness symptoms.”He said that they are tracing the contacts of the patients.Gaurav Sharma, the deputy commissioner of police (outer-north), said, “The three policemen were deployed in north-west district. They tested positive earlier and their relatives who came in contact with them also got infected. That led to the sealing process.”A containment area is a complete quarantine zone and no one is allowed to step out even to buy essential goods such as milk, vegetables, fruits etc. All the entry and exit points and even the internal lanes are barricaded in the containment zones. The authorities allow only a number of selected vendors to supply groceries and other essentials to the neighbourhood with the help of RWA and civil defence volunteers.The south Delhi district administration on Tuesday ordered scaling down operation of a containment area in Mehrauli where two people involved in food distribution had tested positive on April 27.

26-05-2020||Gurugram||Badshahpur MLA seeks names of non-performing officials on Twitter, evokes sharp retort from politicians||In a move that sparked heated social media discussions, Badshahpur’s independent MLA Rakesh Daultabad on Monday sought names of non-performing officials from city residents and said that he would submit the list to the Haryana chief minister.Daultabad’s post on Twitter elicited sharp retorts from leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress, who termed it a populist measure aimed at currying favour with voters. However, a large number of Gurugram residents came out in support of the MLA, who said that assessing the performance of officials and public feedback was a necessary step as there were many shortcomings and deficiencies in the infrastructure and services delivered by the government.Daultabad in his tweet on Monday said, “I am going to submit list of non-performing govt officers or employees to CM Sahab. You are welcome to share name of such employees with examples of non-performance.”Badshahpur residents immediately replied, highlighting deficiencies in road infrastructure and water supply, electricity shortages, roads in new sectors, overpricing of liquor and a few calling for a new development authority, alleging that existing agencies have failed to deliver the goods.Later on Tuesday, Daultabad said that residents had responded positively and sent around 400 messages to his post. “Our objective is not to point fingers but to assess the ground situation and know what the perception of people is about governance. We will convey the feedback received from people to the government and CM, regarding the issues faced by city residents,” he said, adding that citizens were asked to state specific instances and attach proofs to support their views.Pravin Malik, the president of Sare Home residents’ welfare association (RWA), said that since Gurugram was a corporate city, there was a need for a 360-degree review of performance by public officials and to set benchmarks for delivery. “The government employees must be assessed for performance and feedback must be taken from people who can really say what (services) they are getting,” he said.Among those who criticised Daultabad’s post was BJP’s Manish Yadav, Daultabad’s rival during the last state elections.Yadav posted on Twitter, “We have the most promising and performing government under the leadership of Sh ML Khattar, who is delivering to its best even in this difficult times n before pointing on administration we need to ask ourselves, are we giving our Best.”Yadav could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.A Congress leader from Badshahpur said that the MLA, who is asking questions, is himself a “non-performer”. “Approvals and budgets have been granted for a medical college in Kherki Majra and hospitals in Badshahpur and Farrukhnagar, but how many times has our MLA taken up these issues with CM? This is a move to get popularity only,” he said.Daultabad, however, said that he had been taking up issues related to Gurugram and Badshahpur regularly, and has even raised issues in the legislative assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/badshahpur-mla-seeks-names-of-non-performing-officials-on-twitter-evokes-sharp-retort-from-politicians/story-SCLmEDRLqKIrySYc85EhpM.html

The airport operated 137 departures and 140 arrivals on Tuesday, officials said.Domestic flights had been suspended since March 25, when a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 was announced.On Monday, when the Delhi airport resumed its functioning after two months, it handled 118 arrivals and 125 departures, with a total of 82 flights being cancelled. The flights were cancelled due to a multitude of reasons as airlines resumed operations across India. Instead of following the national guidelines issued by the Centre for all passengers, many states set their own rules: Karnataka requires mandatory institutional quarantine for passengers from worst-affected states, while Punjab and Meghalaya have made a swab test mandatory for arrivals.A senior officer from the airport, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The total operations increased on Tuesday significantly and number of flights cancelled remained lower than the first day. All measures of ensuring adequate deployment of staff to assist passengers and to make sure that safety guidelines are followed are in place. The situation is expected to improve.”The number of passengers stranded at the airport also remained low on Tuesday and there were fewer complaints from passengers about flight cancellations with no prior information, the officer added.Many passengers arriving at the Delhi airport also took to social media to contact the airport operator about availability of cabs.In response, the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) ha tweeted: “prepaid taxi services are operational at Delhi Airport”.The operator also told one of its passengers in a tweet, “You can avail authorized cab services like Meru, Mega, Ola, Uber, WTI and Carzonrent cabs to/from Delhi Airport.”In another tweet to outstation passengers, DIAL said, “taxi services are available at Delhi Airport for outstation destinations. Passengers may need to present an e-pass to the authorities of the destination state. For more info, kindly get in touch with the respective government authority.”App-based cab service provider, Ola, said on Tuesday it has resumed its services at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, along with 21 other airports. In a statement, Ola said that customers need to wear masks, AC will remain switched off, with windows open, only two passengers will be allowed in a car and they’ll load, unload their luggage themselves. Only cashless payments will be accepted, Ola said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/25-flights-cancelled-on-second-day-of-flight-operations-after-shutdown/story-Q7oUJS8VyMGRHy14HeSwUJ.html

The main aim of the scheme is to impart coaching primarily to beginners to encourage participation in sports and for optimum utilisation of the facilities available. SAI, in a statement, said that sporting activity will be allowed at the Jawaharlal Nehru and the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium in slots of one hour which need to be booked online. The activities at two other stadia under SAI --- Indira Gandhi Stadium and Karni Singh Shooting Ranges in Tughlakabad--- can only start next week due to logistical issues. The Shyama Prasad Mukherjee swimming complex (Talkatora) will continue to be out of bounds for the time being.Initially, the JLN Stadium will open its archery, table tennis, badminton and lawn tennis facilities, while the activities allowed at the Dhyan Chand Stadium — the hockey hub in the capital — will depend upon the facilities available.“Guidelines have been made available to the stadia administrators and they have been briefed comprehensively to ensure adherence to government guidelines of health and hygiene,” SAI, the working arm of the sports ministry, said.It said that activities have only been allowed in those disciplines “where no contact is required among players and minimal sharing of equipment is needed”. “In keeping with the guidelines of the government on social distancing and hygiene, it has been decided a maximum of 50 per cent of sports facilities in various stadia will be made operational to ensure social distancing.”To ensure a safe environment, all the facilities opened at the venues have been “disinfected and deep sanitised, in keeping with the guidelines”. “Besides, thermal checks and hand sanitisation of every athlete and accompanying parents is being done at entry gates. The wearing of mask has been made mandatory,” the statement said.A SAI coach said on condition of anonymity that tennis coaching had started at the Dhyan Chand Stadium and 32 players had been shortlisted (online) of which six reported in the 4-5pm slot, while four others reported in the time slot between 5-6 pm. “Training in hockey, cricket and kabaddi couldn’t commence today and is expected to start at 7:30 am tomorrow,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sai-opens-two-stadia-in-capital/story-Ub3gzq9lv1qXXTxqDzOThP.html
26-05-2020||City||Hindon-Hubli flight services suspended for two days||Flights between Hindon and Hubli airports have temporarily been suspended for two days till Wednesday, said officials of the Airport Authority of India (AAI), after the ministry of civil aviation banned all flight services on routes that are more than 500km in stage-length. The private airline operating the route under the UDAN (Ude Desk ke Aam Nagarik) scheme has approached the ministry to grant permission to operate a route which is more than 500km, said AAI officials. In its order of May 24, the ministry had issued directions for the resumption of regional flight services under the UDAN scheme with several riders. One of the criteria states that only operational routes up to 500km in stage-length will be permitted to resume operations.The civil terminal airport at Sikandarpur near the Hindon airbase operates two routes, namely the Hindon-Hubli route and the Hindon-Pithoragarh route. Flight services resumed on May 25 between Hindon-Hubli. A total of 30 passengers arrived in Ghaziabad from Hubli while 18 boarded the same flight back to Hubli.However, the airlines, Star Air, decided to suspend the flights on Tuesday and Wednesday once the criteria of 500km distance was made known to the management. “We received the circular from the ministry on the morning of May 24 that under the UDAN scheme all the flights which are more than 500km would not be permitted to fly. Since Hindon-Hubli is one of the longest routes of about 1,500km, we have requested to the ministry to allow us to operate further flights. We are expecting a reply soon but till then, we have cancelled our flight for two days, starting Tuesday,” said an officer from Star Air.“We got the intimation on May 24 but the flight for May 25 was already booked. As such, we did not want to lose the confidence of the passengers and operated the flight for the day after getting permission. For the flights cancelled for the next two days, we are allowing full refund to passengers who have booked tickets with us. They will be accommodated in the next permitted flights,” the officer said.Shobha Bhardwaj, the director of the civil terminal, also confirmed that flights to Hubli were cancelled for two days.“The airline has approached the ministry for necessary permissions. The flight services will resume once the permission is received. For the other route, Hindon-Pithoragarh, we have no intimation from the airline as of now,” she added.The Hindon-Pithoragarh route is operated by Air Heritage. Its CEO Rohit Mathur did not respond to our calls for comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hindon-hubli-flight-services-suspended-for-two-days/story-NfT96holgSq1Ayu8S7SijM.html
26-05-2020||Delhi||Jamaat organisers wilfully violated norms: Police tells HC||The Delhi Police on Tuesday informed the Delhi high court that Tablighi Jamaat head Maulana Saad and management officials of the Nizamuddin Markaz had “deliberately, wilfully, negligently and malignantly” disobeyed the government’s directives pertaining to the ban on holding large gatherings.The information was given to the court, which was hearing a plea seeking the release of 916 foreign nationals who had been quarantined at government facilities after attending congregations at the Markaz. The police informed the court they were questioning 900 attendees and none of them had been arrested or detained.In the status report, the police said they held several meetings with Saad and Markaz officials to explain to them the about the Covid-19 situation. Despite this, they did not inform the health department or other government agency about large gatherings inside the Markaz, the report read.Standing counsel (criminal), Delhi government, advocate Rahul Mehra told the court on Tuesday that written notices had been issued to Maulana Saad and the Markaz management, but they did not pay heed to it. The gatherings, which took place from March 10 to 23, had led to the single largest source of the Covid-19 transmission across the city in March and April, following which the headquarters in Nizamuddin Basti was also sealed.At least 21 persons evacuated from the Markaz had tested positive for Covid-19 following the evacuation process from March 29-31. Until April 17, when the Delhi government mentioned Jamaat-linked cases in its health bulletin, at least 1,080 attendees had tested positive, with the last positive case being recorded on April 14.“...on March 21, the authorities of Markaz at Tablighi Jammat Headquarters were contacted by Delhi Police. One Mufti Shahzad was apprised of the situation arising out of the spread of the virus and asked to take immediate action for preventing the spread of this disease. He was directed to send the foreigner devotees back to their respective countries and other Indian persons to their respective native places...Moreover, an audio recording purportedly by Saad, was found in circulation on WhatsApp on March 21, in which the speaker was heard asking his followers to defy the lockdown and social distancing and to attend the religious gathering...,” the report said.Delhi Police registered a case against Saad and six other management officials for defying a series of government orders, which banned all gatherings.Quoting the sub-divisional magistrate’s inspection report, the police said that 1,300 attendees were found residing on the premises, without maintaining social distancing.“...No one was seen following directions such as use of facial mask, hand sanitisers, etc. Maulana Saad, others named above and the management of Markaz had deliberately, wilfully, negligently and malignantly committed acts which were in direct contravention to the lawful directions of the Government and public servants...,” the report read.In the last week of March, police and health officials had evacuated over 2,000 Jamaat attendees and sent them to hospitals or quarantine centres. Many who had fled the building and staying across the city were traced and sent to the quarantine facilities. The police are yet to summon Saad to join the investigation. They have got a lookout circular issued against him to prevent him from leaving the country.Saad’s counsel, Fuzail Ayyubi, did not respond to multiple calls and a text message for comment on the police’s status report. Ayyubi had earlier denied the police’s allegations and said that the Tablighi Jamaat members were trapped because of the lockdown and could not leave the building due to lack of conveyance.Standing counsel, Mehra, on Tuesday told the court that over 900 Jamaat attendees had joined the investigation. Mehra said the police would file more charge-sheets in the case at the trial court within a week. On Tuesday, the police filed 20 charge-sheets against 82 Tablighi Jamaat members.Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocates Rebecca John and Ashima Mandla said all foreign nationals who tested negative be released from institutional quarantine to alternative accommodations, factoring social distancing.The police told the court that the passports of 723 foreign nationals and identity cards of 23 Nepali nationals have been seized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jamaat-organisers-wilfully-violated-norms-police-tells-hc/story-OGOgl7cpnIpuWT7eMHPrHN.html

Blistering heat also swept Narnaul at 46 degrees Celsius, five notches above normal limits.Among other places in Haryana, Ambala sizzled at 44.2 degrees Celsius, up five notches, while Karnal sweltered under intense heat at 44 degrees Celsius, five notches above normal limits.Sweltering heat also swept Bathinda and Patiala in Punjab which recorded a high of 45.5 and 44.7 degrees Celsius, respectively. Amritsar and Ludhiana also recorded above normal maximums of 43.7 degrees Celsius and 44.1 degrees Celsius, respectively.Chandigarh, the common capital of the two states, also experienced a hot day at 43.1 degrees Celsius, four notches above normal limits.According to the MeT department forecast, heatwave conditions will continue to prevail for the next two days in Punjab and Haryana. ‘SOME RESPITE BY THURSDAY’ Chandigarh IMD scientist Shivinder Singh said the heatwave in the region had been caused by hot surface winds blowing in from Rajasthan, where at some stations the maximum temperature had crossed 47 degrees C.Some respite was possible by Thursday when a western disturbance was likely to affect the region. “Cloudy weather and a chance of light rain up to 20mm along with gusty winds up to 40km are likely to bring the maximum temperature back in the 30s,” he said.Agro meteorologist at PAU regional research centre, Bathinda, Dr Raj Kumar Paul said: “Thunderstorm with wind speed of 30-40kmph is expected at isolated places on May 28 and squall with wind speed of 50-60kmph at some places in the region is expected on May 29 and 30. Light to moderate rain is expected at some places by May 30, 31.” ‘HEATSTROKE CAN BE DANGEROUS’Consultant physician Dr Vitull K Gupta said people have not acclimatised to the prevailing weather conditions. People need to be cautious as it might lead to heat effects, he said, adding people should avoid direct contact with sunlight and drink a lot of water mixed with a pinch of salt. Patiala civil surgeon Dr Harish Malhotra said such rise in temperature can lead to heatstroke which can result in physiological strain and even death. The health department has advised the residents to avoid going out between 12 noon and 3pm.“Besides, people should wear lightweight, light-coloured, porous cotton clothes and when outside, use protective goggles, umbrella or a hat,” the civil surgeon said.He added that the parents should strictly keep their children inside houses and should not allow them to play in open fields before 6pm.He said the signs of heatstroke include rashes, headache, vomiting, red and dry skin, muscular weakness, giddiness and loss of sweat. Persons affected by sunstroke should be given first-aid immediately, including pouring water (room temperature) on their head, wiping their body with wet cloth so as to bring down body temperature, before rushing to the nearest hospital.(Inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/heatwave-sweeps-across-punjab-haryana-hisar-hottest-at-48-c/story-PqGaNT4aC1VKcpHfcR4SUP.html
26-05-2020||Delhi||90% DU students not ready to give exams: teachers’ body||Around 90% of Delhi University (DU) students said they are not prepared to appear for the university examinations citing a number of reasons, from not having materials to not having high-speed connectivity to attend online examinations, according to a survey by the varsity teachers’ associationThe Covid-19 lockdown enforced since March 25 has affected the university’s examination schedule. On May 14, DU had announced that it may conduct open-book online examinations for final-year students if the Covid-19 situation prevented the regular pen-paper mode. Teachers and students have been opposing the decision citing lack of access to high-speed internet, devices like smartphones and laptops, intermittent electricity in remote areas, among others.The survey, by Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA), had over 51,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students as respondents, over 21,800 of whom were final year students. The university has 900,000 students.According to the survey, over 85% students said they were not ready for an online open-book examination (OBE).Over 70% of the respondents in the survey said they attended less than half of the online classes conducted on through video conferencing apps. Over 55% of the students did not have the reading material for the syllabus covered before the pandemic struck since they left their notes in Delhi while returning to their home town.Sneha Sarah, a final year student of Hindu College and who is now in her home town of Kollam in Kerala, said, “I have to rely on online resources for learning since most of my books are in Delhi. Besides, we are not used to studying using our phones and laptops. The network receptivity in my area is poor. Many students, including me, have been under quarantine and we can’t even step out or go somewhere where the receptivity is better.”While 50% students were able to access reading material sent to them by their teachers during the lockdown, nearly 12% said they did not receive any material while 38% said they weren’t able to access the e-learning material. The teachers’ body also plans to share these details with the Ministry of Human Resource Development and continue opposing the OBE mode. Despite repeated calls and messages over the questions raised on online examination and their feasibility, DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi could not be reached for comment.According to the DUTA survey, over 80% of the students said they were unable to concentrate on their studies owing to the current pandemic. “The economic strain on families due to the Covid-19 crisis affects the students as well. Besides, students sometimes have to step outside their homes for better network reception. Around 74% study on their smartphones and this limits their comprehension as well,” said Abha Dev Habib, DUTA treasurer.The teachers’ body also raised concerns over the differently-abled students and the university administration’s silence over how scribes would be arranged for such students. DUTA president Rajib Ray said, “We have been arguing that the OBE is a faulty method of examination as it discriminates against those without access to books, notes and online resources, encourages malpractice and penalizes honest students.” He also said that the decision should have been taken in consultation with the university’s statutory bodies and stakeholders.A member of DU’s task force constituted to look into the academic challenges during the lockdown, requesting anonymity, said even if the lockdown ends, it would not be possible for students to come for regular pen-paper mode examination.“Over 50% of our students are not from Delhi. There are concerns over whether they will manage to get tickets or not. Will they need to be quarantined after coming here or not? In such a scenario, online examination seems to be the only option. The recommendations for taking an average of previous semesters won’t work for final year students because foreign universities need to see what the students studied during the course. What will the students mention for this year?” the member said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/90-du-students-not-ready-to-give-exams-teachers-body/story-WQ5KUnFkAp2xNtYTdCKslO.html

26-05-2020||Patna||A day after JD-U MLA booked for triple murder, his brother shot dead||In the continuing spiral of violence in Gopalganj district even amid the Covid-19 lockdown, unidentified assailants Tuesday shot dead a close relative of controversial JD(U) MLA from Kuchaikot, Amrendra Pandey alias Pappu Pandey, a day after the MLA’s elder brother and his son were arrested for the murder of three members of an RJD leader’s family on Sunday. Tuesday’s killing took place at Repura village under Hathua police station in Gopalganj district.This is ninth murder in the last five months in the district.The deceased was identified as Shashikant alias Munna Tiwari (45), a contractor, and a cousin of the MLA. Agitated over the incident, villagers blocked a stretch of the National Highway 28, demanding immediate arrest of the killers and transfer of the Hathua station house officer (SHO) alleging that he was hand-in-glove with criminal elements.The deceased’s sister, Kiran Devi, said the incident took place when Tiwari was standing outside his house. She said four assailants on two motorcycles reached the spot and fired at him from point blank range.“We are investigating the case. The reason could be a dispute over contracts. Preliminary investigation suggested that the deceased had got a contract of Rs 40 lakh to construct a pond ,” Gopalganj SP Manoj Tiwari said.On Sunday evening, assailants had killed three persons of an RJD leader’s family. The RJD leader, JP Choudhary, who was injured in the firing, is being treated at Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) in the state capital. Five persons, including the MLA, his brother Satish Pandey and nephew Mukesh Pandey were booked for the triple murder. The next day, Satish and his son Mukesh Pandey, chairman of Gopalganj district board, were arrested. Meanwhile, Leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Tuesday issued an ultimatum to the state government to arrest the MLA.He also visited the PMCH in Patna to enquire about the health of JP Choudhary. “I give an ultimatum of two days to the state government to arrest the absconding MLA. Otherwise, I and my party workers will march to Gopalganj and launch an intensive agitation,” Yadav said.When contacted, JD (U) spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan Prasad said, “Rule of law prevails in Bihar. The present dispensation doesn’t differentiate between common people and the high and mighty. And Tejashwi Yadav should also know that it is Bihar of 2020 and not 1990.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/a-day-after-jd-u-mla-booked-for-triple-murder-his-brother-shot-dead/story-8l2SZTU7RxnU9yAlXGq45H.html
26-05-2020||Noida||District administration redefines containment zones for high-rises||A day after residents of a Greater Noida west township held a protest against the authority’s decision to seal the entire society after three positive Covid-19 cases were reported from the housing complex, the district administration has redefined containment zones for high-rises.According to Uttar Pradesh government guidelines, any residential area with multiple cases will become a containment zone and will be sealed for a period of 21 days. However, in a statement released by the office of the district magistrate Suhas Lalinakere Yathiraj on Tuesday, the radius of the containment zone will now depend on the number of cases.“In consultation with the state government, containment zones have been redefined for multi-storied buildings and societies in urban areas. If a single case is reported in a multi-storey society, only that particular tower will be sealed, and if more than one case is reported, the previous rule will be applicable according to which sealing radius will be 500 metre for containment and 250 metre for the buffer zone,” the order said.The order further stated that in case towers of the same society fall outside the 500 metre radius, they will not be considered as part of the containment zone.Residents of various high-rises have welcomed the district administration’s move.“It is very difficult for high-rises that have thousands of people living in them to have them sealed. It’s a question of their livelihood. People in hot spots cannot even get administrative passes. Not all societies have grocery shops within their premises, thus creating further problems. We were in touch with a few local politicians to highlight the issue, part from us taking up social media campaigns. The decision to implement partial sealing is better than the entire complex being sealed and a less number of residents will be affected,” Abhishek Kumar, president, NEFOWA, a Greater Noida West association of high-rises, said.The administration’s decision comes 24 hours after residents of Supertech Ecovillage had held a protest on Monday evening when their society had been sealed. The society has over 3,000 flats and all three positive cases, reported over the past seven days, are from the same family.“It was a media house employee who was found positive first followed by his mother and son. We understand the regulations. But it is a huge township. People were not comfortable with the whole society being sealed. By 8pm, many residents had gathered to protest against the sealing,” Sameer Bhardwaj, a resident of the society, said.He said many residents are worried about their jobs as offices have now resumed functioning. “If the entire area is put under lockdown, we understand. But for a few people to be unable to go to work while the rest of the world is slowly getting back to its feet, puts our employment in jeopardy,” Bhardwaj said.It was only after local police intervention that the residents were dispersed and the district administration officials continued with the sealing on Monday“People were under the assumption that only a part of the society will be sealed, but that confusion was cleared and the residents were told that for now, the decision has been taken to seal the entire society. They were assured that all products of daily need will be provided to them at their doorstep and people are cooperating with the authorities,” a statement issued from the district police earlier said.In a video circulating on social media, police personnel from Bisrakh station were seen pacifying residents and letting them know that in case of medical emergencies, they will be allowed to go to hospitals while arrangements will also be made to provide medicines to residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/district-administration-redefines-containment-zones-for-high-rises/story-saM38OkBnaW1v5k2crfikO.html

26-05-2020||Noida||Newborn dies as father made to take him to 3 govt hospitals||At a time when Uttar Pradesh officials and the district administration of Gautam Budh Nagar are daily claiming that their health care system is geared up to tackle any emergency, a newborn boy died in his father’s arms on Tuesday even as the desperate man was made to go from one government hospital to another in an effort to get treatment for his child. The distraught father said he had to wait for two hours for an ambulance to arrive and was made to go to three government hospitals with the sick baby. The newborn was finally declared dead at the third hospital, the Child PGI in Sector 30, on Tuesday morning.He later made a video narrating his ordeal, while returning home with the body of his child tied to his motorbike. The administration took the cognizance of the matter and said a team comprising two doctors will now look into it.According to Prem Kumar, a resident of Sector 36, Noida, his wife delivered a boy at a private hospital at 9.30pm on Monday. However, due to certain medical complications, the child was later referred to another hospital. The father and his uncle rushed to the neighbouring speciality hospital where the child was kept on life support, but Kumar said since he could not afford the expenses of that hospital, he called for an ambulance to go to the Dadri community health centre. “After multiple calls, even to the police, the ambulance arrived about two hours later. We took the child off the life support only to find that the ambulance did not have a functional oxygen cylinder on board. We somehow managed to reach Dadri CHC by midnight. The staff there refused to tend to my child and asked me to go to the government hospital in Noida,” Kumar said.“Upon reaching the Noida government hospital in Sector 30, the staff asked me to take the baby to the nearby Child PGI. But there was no one there to treat the baby and he was declared dead in the morning,” Kumar said.He said while the ambulance had an oxygen cylinder, it did not have the device to control the flow. “So when Dadri CHC turned us away, we had to make a detour to a private hospital and borrow the device. However, that device also did not work,” Kumar said.“At Child PGI, too, they did not tend to my baby for a long time and asked us to wait. A staffer placed my child on a stretcher and left. Running out of patience, I knocked on different cabins and, in one of them, we saw a few people sitting with stethoscopes around their neck. We requested them to help us. One of them got up and put the stethoscope on the baby’s chest and said he was dead. They then gave us a death certificate,” Kumar said.Kumar, who works at a private company in Greater Noida, said owing to the nationwide lockdown, he hadn’t got his salary for the past three months and hence could not afford the private hospital treatment costs. He sad he dialled all the health department helpline numbers he could find on the internet and the police’s helpline number too after the ambulance took a long time to arrive. “If I had ₹25,000, I could have got my son treated at a private hospital. We paid ₹8,000 to the hospital for a few hours of support,” he said.A comment could not be obtain from Gautam Budh Nagar chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri, who went to a meeting and later could not be reached despite numerous attempts. Subdivisional Magistrate, Dadri, Rajiv Rai also could not be reached despite repeated attempts. The district magistrate’s office when reached, said the DM is yet to comment on the incident.“CMO Ohri has taken the cognizance of the incident related to the death of a child due to medical negligence. Realising the gravity of the situation, a probe committee comprising district surveillance officer Dr Sunil Doherey and additional chief medical officer Dr Sanjeev Mangalik has been formed. Strict action will be taken against those responsible,” said district information officer Rakesh Chauhan in a statement .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/newborn-dies-as-father-made-to-take-him-to-3-govt-hospitals/story-SLbVNlDAoC6XXYUif5Zk2O.html
26-05-2020||Pune||These Pune shopkeepers too afraid to stay open despite no restrictions||Measures taken by the government to revive small and mediums business activity has received a lukewarm response. Though the guidelines allow non-essential shops to be open till 7pm, the spike in Covid-19 cases is keeping the shopkeepers from following the 7pm deadline.The lockdown relaxation seemed to have little or no effect in areas like Tilak road, Appa Balwant chowk, Shukrwar peth, Khadki and Aundh where some shops operated in the morning hours only.According to Fatechand Ranka, president of Pune Vyapari Mahasangh association (federation of Pune traders) rise in cases among shopkeepers is also one of the reasons. “So far 52 shopkeepers, traders and their close contacts have tested Covid positive,” he said.Last week, 41 close contacts of the seven employees of a medical wholesaler shop in Sadashiv peth tested positive. The close contacts reside in areas like like Sadashiv peth, Bibvewadi, Yerawada, Hadapsar, Dhankawadi, Sinhgad road and Aundh. Similarly a liquor shop owner who has two wine shops in Baner and Balewadi was tested positive last week.As of May 25, Pune has seen 264 deaths and 5,181 positive cases due to Covid-19.Ranka said, “We are working on all possible ways to restart businesses across Pune. But as the number of positive patients is rising every day we are worried. And then there are some cases where traders, shop owners and their family members have also tested positive. There are around 30,000 shop owners and traders in Pune and many of them are worried about getting infected.”Ranka said that safety guidelines have been issued to association members to enable them to keep their shops open during the day.Ashish Oswal, proprietor of a shop of household items near Shanipar chowk said he runs his from 10am to 2pm. “There are hardly any customers after 2 pm and we do not have any helpers in the shop,” he said, adding that he and his brother manage the shop after taking all precautions.Shriniwas Mane, owner of Himalaya Shoes at Appa Balwant chowk said he keeps his shop open from 10.30 am to 2.30 pm and none of his family members come to the shop, “I don’t want my elderly father or any other family member to take any risk,” he said.Rohan Nalawade, owner of Rohan Milk and dairy products on Tilak road said although his is an essential goods shop, he runs it only till 2pm or 3 pm, mainly because he does not wish to take any risk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/these-pune-shopkeepers-too-afraid-to-stay-open-despite-no-restrictions/story-FX9vSSMODDv890yRNN3ugK.html
26-05-2020||Chandigarh||Corona effect: PG owners, small entrepreneurs battle for survival||Ajit Road in Bathinda, which till the end of March remained abuzz with student activities as it is home to over 150 IELTS training centres and over 250 PG accommodations, now bears a deserted look.Owing to coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent nationwide lockdown, the coaching institutes have been shut down since more than two months now.Scores of small time entrepreneurs, including juice-sellers, eatery owners, stationery shops, and gift shops, who were dependent on students visiting the city from Punjab and the adjoining states, are battling for survival.Many dhabas and PG accommodations have been closed down in the past few weeks. Sources said the coaching sector and allied businesses are yet to hear any word of support from the Bathinda legislator and state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal.Arshdeep Singh Sidhu and Lovepreet Singh Thind, who run IELTS coaching institutes, complain of losing peak business season from April to September. “We cannot demand this, but it will be a goodwill gesture from the building owners if they waive off the pending rent. Bathinda is an academic coaching hub and state should have some relief plan for this sector,” said Thind.Sukhraj Singh, who had ventured into the business of PG accommodations for girl students two years back, has to close down operations earlier this month.“I had hired a spacious house to facilitate 25-30 girls. All was doing well till Covid-19 and lockdown hit the business. Students left the accommodation overnight in March. And uncertainty looms over the future of PGs. I will not be able to pay rent for the house while no one is coming up to stay there,” he said.Another entrepreneur Sharda Kapoor, who has taken a flat and two independent houses on rent, is also worried about the business that she had started 15 years back.“There has been no income in the last two months and the rental amounts are piling up. Soon, I will have to take a final decision,” she said.Tarun Chugh, 30, who prior to the lockdown used to remain busy through the day at his fresh juice shop on Ajit Road, hardly has any work to do these days. Chugh, who was successfully running operations since 2014, has seen a 90% decline in business. He had to cut his support staff from six persons to one.“Before lockdown, I made a daily average sale of Rs 30,000 and now it is not even Rs 3,000. Coaching institutes are closed, so I hardly have any customers coming in,” he said.Navneet Goyal, who owns a stationery shop, says order of closure of coaching institutes has severely hit our business. “IELTS training centres contribute a sizable amount to the local economy. I am facing over 85% loss in business,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/corona-effect-pg-owners-small-entrepreneurs-battle-for-survival/story-UfzDoHR2Mh8guXpAWOBEeM.html

A video clip of the minister walking in procession in the village has since gone viral.Jyoti’s 14-day home quarantine period has yet not ended as she had arrived here in the night of May 16.Village ward member Nagendra Paswan said he had lost count of people visiting Sirhulli to felicitate her. “I have got a toilet built for her under government scheme in two days,” he said.Sahni could not be contacted for his comment despite repeated attempts.In a change of heart, Jyoti has now been considering the invitation extended to her by Cycling Federation of India (CFI) with all seriousness.Earlier, speaking to media, she had said she needed some time to be in right frame of mind to accept the trial offer to become a trainee cyclist and that she wanted to resume her studies.Jyoti said over phone on Tuesday that she had already started practising since the previous day. “I will participate in the trial when they (CFI) call me and fix a date for the trial next month”, she said, adding that she was practising on a racing cycle gifted to her recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bihar-minister-lands-at-cycle-girl-s-village-with-zero-distancing/story-4Pk8I1p5z39rv3XFzkjrTN.html

Those in the exempted categories will be allowed to cross the state lines, the DM said.“There were jams at the border as we conducted checks in compliance with the order of the district magistrate. We have opened the UP Gate and Anand Vihar-Kaushambi border for commuters, but people are allowed passage to Delhi only on the basis of passes issued by the administration,” Anshu Jain, Indirapuram’s circle officer, said.“So far, we have allowed passage to vehicles involved in essential services over the flyover at UP Gate. Below the flyover, we are trying to create separate lanes for different categories of commuters. The plan will be put in place after discussions,” she said.Jaivir Singh from Vaishali in Ghaziabad, one of those stuck at UP Gate on Tuesday, said he was not allowed entry to Delhi.“I reached the border, but was sent back by cops who said I need a valid to go to Delhi. The Delhi government has opened its offices and the Ghaziabad police are not allowing us to cross the borders even though I showed them my official ID,” Singh, who works with the municipal corporation of Delhi, said.“So, I turned back after waiting for about an hour at UP Gate in the scorching heat,” he added. He said for the past about a week, the movement at the border was easy.Like Singh, Neeraj Kumar also goes to Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar, where he works with a private company involved in the sale of cars.“The police did not allow me entry to Delhi and I had to return home. They asked me to apply for a pass in order to travel to Delhi. I will now ait for my office to arrange it,” Kumar, a resident of Sanjay Nagar, Ghaziabad, said.“Generally, we find jams at the border while coming home in the evening as police strict about checking IDs before letting us pass. On Tuesday, they have started similar checks in the morning as well. Many commuters were told to turn back,” Kumar said.The Ghaziabad administration on Monday restricted movement between Delhi and Ghaziabad citing an increase in Covid-19 cases with links to Delhi, especially since the beginning of May.Vehicles engaged in essential services have been allowed to move without any restrictions while doctors, paramedics, police and bank employees will be asked to produce their identification cards.Likewise, media persons and lawyers can also cross the borders after showing their identity cards. However, employees of private firms with offices in Delhi will have to apply for passes.The order also states that commuters are advised to leave Ghaziabad maximum by 9am and return only after 6pm. Officials said those wanting to travel to Delhi can apply for passes at http://164.100.68.164/upepass2/.Officials said Monday’s direction was an extension of the May 18 lockdown 4.0 guidelines issued by the Uttar Pradesh government. Under the May 18 directions of chief secretary RK Tiwari, commuters from Delhi, other than those from hotspots, were allowed to travel to the National Capital Region (NCR) areas of Noida and Ghaziabad and the district administration was asked to issue detailed directions in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-cops-turn-away-commuters-without-passes-at-up-gate-deny-them-entry-to-delhi/story-Q4OVO9UsV6SuPo5fNH3pzH.html

When they contacted the traffic police, officials said they had not issued any challans to them.According to sources, the miscreants are getting details and contact numbers of vehicle owners from mobile phone applications. The miscreants are sending messages to contact numbers with vehicle numbers as well.The fraudsters have also added a fake link https://echallanparivahan.in to pay fine of Rs 500 online.

26-05-2020||Chandigarh||In corona times, water crisis adds to woes in Chandigarh villages||“The government is emphatic that we wash our hands every half an hour to keep the coronavirus at bay. But how do we stay safe when we don’t have enough water even for drinking or cooking?” asked Ajay Pandey, resident of Daria, a village on the periphery of Chandigarh, where several localities have been struggling with water scarcity for two weeks now.Pandey was among several others who, with their empty buckets, gathered near Boriwali Gali Tubewell in Daria Colony on Tuesday evening to protest water scarcity. Their struggle to get water is far greater than their need to take precautions.Raje Da Bagh and Sunrise School Colony, where more than 500 families live, are some of the other localities in a water crisis, said Daria’s former sarpanch Gupreet Singh Happy.Speaking on the issue, Chandigarh civic body’s junior engineer, Jatinder Walia, said most areas where water supply is erratic fall outside the lal dora area of the village, where people have illegally punctured water pipes. “But the situation is expected to ease as we have increased operational hours of tubewells,” he said.Area volunteer Sunil Singh said these were lame excuses as 90% of the population outside lal dora has legal water connections. “The issue is the rapid increase in population. The water available is inadequate its distribution is poor,” he added.“Till the time our village gets water from the canal, there will always be water scarcity in summer,” said former sarpanch Gurpeet Singh.Daria is not the only area affected by the erratic supply of clean drinking water. Residents of Sanjay Colony near the Industrial Area also held a protest against water scarcity in their area last Friday. Area councillor Shakti Prakash Devshali said the colony’s only source of water is through the stand post even as the demand has reached its peak due to the summer. “I am trying my best to arrange MC tankers for the area,” he said.Complaints of water shortage are also pouring in daily from Hallomajra, Ram Darbar, Kishangarh, Palsora, Dhanas and Maloya.Satish Kainth, the Congress councillor representing Palsora, said the municipal corporation has spent ₹200 crore to bring an additional 29 MGD canal water but the city’s distribution system is in peril. “Urban pockets of Chandigarh are well connected to canal water supply. But there is no such system in villages and colonies, where supply is inadequate as there are only a few tubewells,” he informed.“Moreover, authorities are not strengthening water infrastructure outside lal dora, claiming that construction in such areas is illegal. However, if most residents there have legal water connections, how can the MC or UT deny them their right to clean water?” Kainth questioned.Kishangarh resident Narinder Lubana said there were only two tubewells for 22,000 residents of Kishangarh village (behind Sukhna Lake). “We have been asking MC to install more tubewells for the last two years but all in vain,” he said. “Those who can afford it bring private tankers, while others struggle to get water every day,” he said.During the Tuesday review meeting, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore directed the MC commissioner KK Yadav to ensure adequate drinking water supply to the city. “Tankers should be dispatched, wherever necessary,” he said further.While Yadav could not be reached, MC chief engineer Shailender Singh said tankers are being sent to areas affected by water scarcity. “We will increase the frequency,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-corona-times-water-crisis-adds-to-woes-in-chandigarh-villages/story-gFjH2zgZX2p5JYWWueo4RM.html
26-05-2020||City||10 yrs on, residents of Zirakpur housing project await completion certificates||Even though Zirakpur municipal corporation has not issued completion certificates to two housing projects—Aastha Apartment (Phases 1 and 2)—which were approved in December 2006 and March 2007 respectively, the builders have already given possession to around 125 allottees starting from 2009. The builder had assured allottees that completion and occupation certificates would be provided in due course for these apartments built on Nabha–Babhat road in Zirakpur.However, more than a decade on, the builder has not completed the project as per sanctioned plan, stirring up much resentment among the allottees. Both housing projects comprise a total of 154 flats in seven towers–66 flats in three towers of phase 1 and 88 flats in four towers of phase 2.As per the norm, possession of flats can only be given after obtaining completion and occupation certificates.In the past 10 years or so, the builder has not constructed a tubewell for phase 2, and the sewerage treatment plant (STP) installed for phase 1 is also not functional. As per building bylaws, two lifts were to be installed in each tower, but the developer has provided only one. Additionally, the builder has illegally constructed a series of shops along the boundary wall, which was not part of the sanctioned project. In another discrepancy, the projects were given joint facilities whereas both projects had individual facilities in the plan. In September 2017, residents of phase 2 also moved Punjab and Haryana Court requesting for completion of development work as per sanctioned plan and removal of violations, following which the court directed Zirakpur MC that until occupation/ completion certificates were not provided to the developer, the latter is liable to pay all cost charges and expenses for common facilities to authorities such as MC and the power department. However, the builder has not adhered to the court directive either.Gulshan Rai, an allottee, said that in December 2018, a written complaint was lodged against the builder to the chief vigilance officer of local bodies department, but still no action was taken. Surprisingly, the builder has even claimed a deduction of around ₹6 crore of income tax on the income derived from this housing project for assessment years 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10 under Section 80 (IB) of IT Act, he said.When contacted, one of the project owners, Sanjeev Garg, said, “We have applied for occupation and completion certificates, but my partners will know more about the details.” When asked as to on what grounds was possession given to allottees without the requisite certificates, he said they had given the documents to allottees about 10 years ago, and refused to comment further.Executive officer of Kharar MC, Sandeep Tiwari, said he had only recently joined the office and would definitely look into it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10-yrs-on-residents-of-zirakpur-housing-project-await-completion-certificates/story-O8nLLBv886zTE3C56ifWlL.html

26-05-2020||City||Low customer turnout marks first day of market reopening in Ghaziabad||Even as the markets in Ghaziabad reopened after a gap of two months, most shops in the trans-Hindon areas witnessed a low turnout of customers on Tuesday. Tuesday was the first day when the markets in the areas resumed sales after the district administration eased the restrictions in the fourth phase of the lockdown.On May 22, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey had directed that certain markets, out of a total of 34, will open on Monday, Wednesday and Friday while others will open on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. He had also given two days to shop owners to finish cleaning and sanitization work.“As per our estimates, only 10 to 15% customers as compared to normal days arrived for shopping today and purchased items of regular use like shoes, slippers, readymade clothes, fans, coolers, etc. However, customers stayed away from shops selling snacks and other food items,” said Pradeep Gupta, convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti, Indirapuram.“The timing is also a cause of concern as markets have been allowed to open only from 10am to 5pm, while during the summers most people prefer to arrive in the evenings. So, the sales will be affected largely,” Gupta said.The markets in Indirapuram, Vaishali, Sahibabad, Bajaria, Gandhi Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Mohan Nagar, Shastri Nagar and Turab Nagar, among others, will open on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.The markets allowed to open on Monday, Wednesday and Friday are the ones located in Vasundhara, Kaushambi, Raj Nagar District Centre, Kavi Nagar, Rajendra Nagar, Shyam Park, Raj Nagar Extension, Navyug Market, Ambedkar Road and those in Delta colonies of Ramprastha, Brij Vihar, Surya Nagar and Chander Nagar.Shop owners like RK Agrawal who runs a tiles store in Indirapuram’s Gyan Khand, said that there was no business at all on Tuesday.“The summer heat is taking a toll and alternate day opening of markets is also a concern. It is because a customer takes days to decide about purchasing non-essential items. Nowadays, people have less money in hand. So, most of them only prefer purchasing essential items. As per my estimates, it will take another six months for markets to pick up,” he added.The market association of Vaishali said that there was about 40% turnout of customers on Tuesday.“The sweet shops also opened and owners were relieved as the administration has allowed opening of such shops on all six days. The shop owners made arrangements for social distancing and provided sanitizer to customers. Even some district administration officers arrived in the market for inspection. However, the closure of border affected opening of shops as a number of owners stay in Delhi,” said Sanjay Rastogi, president of Vaishali Udyog Vyapar Mandal.According to Rastogi, the locality has about 600 to 700 shops in market areas.However, in city areas, the turnout of customers in markets was high as compared to the trans-Hindon areas.“The customers turned out in large numbers despite heat wave conditions. Our market witnessed a footfall of about 60-65% as compared to normal days. People were a bit confused whether to move out to markets or not, as markets are generally closed on Tuesday in Ghaziabad. This is why many customers might not have come for shopping,” said Rajneesh Bansal, chairman of Turab Nagar Vyapar Mandal.Some residents were seen buying daily use items in Vaishali and other markets.“The markets have reopened after two months. So, I came to purchase garments, cosmetics and kitchen items. The rest of items I purchased online during the lockdown days. Due the heat wave, I made only specific purchases,” said Pooja Negi, a resident of Vaishali.Neelam Verma, a resident of Nehru Nagar, said, “I went out to buy T-shirts for my children and some readymade garments for summer. I have used face mask and also carried a sanitizer bottle. The shopping was time taking due to social distancing precautions.” According to the official estimates, the Ghaziabad city has a presence of about 1.5-2 lakh shops, including standalone and those in market areas.“We have deployed team of inspectors to do rounds in markets. The overall customer turnout was low at about 10%. It was very low in areas like Indirapuram and Vaishali. However, the shop owners were particular about social distancing initiatives and sanitizers were made available at shops for customers,” said Rajesh Kumar, district labour commissioner.“The timing of closing of shops cannot be extended now as the movement is not allowed from 7pm to 7am as per the lockdown guidelines,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/low-customer-turnout-marks-first-day-of-market-reopening-in-ghaziabad/story-skHuYrhHOXX6iPORl9lVXO.html

However, presently, only less than 40% of the dependents need free food from kitchens, said officials.“We have decided to shut down a community kitchen at the Shani temple because most of the migrants who were depended on this facility are not turning up for free food. Earlier, we were cooking food for at least 600 people at this facility. But now, most of them may have either gone back to their respective home towns or have gone back to their work,” said Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty of the Noida authority.The authority officials said that less than 40% the people now need food across the city in different areas.The Noida authority is running four community kitchens in the district in areas such as Harola, Sector 5, Bhangel, Sorkha and Mamura. When the government announced the nationwide lockdown with the aim of preventing the spread of Covid-19 infection, the Noida authority had started these kitchens to distribute fresh food for the migrants, who were left jobless.But the Uttar Pradesh government on May 18 decided to resume operations at factories, construction sites and other businesses. The government also started providing transport facilities to the migrants so that they can go back to their respective home towns. The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration and other agencies have sent back more than 80,000 migrants already.“We believe that most of them have back gone to their home towns and others have returned to their respective jobs,” said Tripathi.The authority officials said that migrants are leaving the city daily and their numbers are decreasing very fast. If all these migrants leave, we will shut down all the kitchens. As per data available, till May 24, the authority has distributed 1,07,376 food packets to migrant workers. An additional 50 lakh food packets were distributed by self help groups, developers, private firms, corporate houses and individuals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/as-migrants-leave-city-noida-shuts-one-of-five-community-kitchens/story-l7PDymg6htso2SqRq91hjL.html

26-05-2020||City||‘Party’ at Lodhi Club in Ludhiana amid lockdown sparks controversy||With seven executive members of the Lodhi Club allegedly getting together inside the club for a party amid lockdown on Sunday, the coveted organisation has landed in a controversy. Deputy commissioner (DC) Pradeep Agrawal, who is president of the club, has sought a report to initiate further action. The members have, however, claimed that it was a meeting and they only had lunch inside the club. The clubs have been closed in the city due to lockdown and the security superviser, who was deputed at the club on Sunday and captured the incident in his mobile phone, has not been ‘approachable’ since Monday as per the club authorities. The members had, however, got the video deleted from his mobile phone and allegedly terminated his services. The executive members, excluding general secretary Nitin Mahajan and two women members, entered the club with food and they were captured in the CCTV cameras moving out of the club with a beer case. Mahajan said, “They are looking into the CCTV footage, but there was no CCTV in the party hall. The security superviser deputed at the club on that day is not approachable. It was also said that services of the superviser were terminated after he tried to record the incident in the mobile phone, but no such incident has come to my notice so far.”“Members concerned have claimed that they went to the club for a meeting, which was called by sports secretary Dr Avinash Jindal for reviewing some projects of the club and they only had lunch, brought by one of the members from his house. In the CCTV footage, members were seen moving out with a beer case, but they said that the beer had expired and they took out the same for destroying it. I will submit my report with DC Agrawal on Wednesday,” said Mahajan, adding that further action has to be taken by the DC. Agrawal said the general secretary has been asked to record the facts in a report, following which further action would be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/party-at-lodhi-club-in-ludhiana-amid-lockdown-sparks-controversy/story-wBjoDGAoBPtxXa6pghCqxK.html

Defying guidelines, many liquor vends can be found open even at 8pm at several places. In the lockdown 4.0, liquor vends have been allowed to open from 7am to 6pm. In lockdown 3.0 from May 4 to 17, the Punjab government allowed opening of liquor vends from May 7. But the traders opted to keep the vends closed for over a week demanding that state government compensates them for loss of business due to closure of vends due to the lockdown. Traders starting opening vends from May 14 after chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh formed a panel of officials to asses losses to traders due to lockdown. The CM had also approved the finance department’s recommendation to provide proportionate adjustment of ‘minimum guarantee quota’ for the losses incurred in the 9 days of lockdown in March (2.5% cut from total revenue quota of Rs 5,675 crore), which comes out to Rs 141 crore. In the current financial year, relaxation of 10% (Rs 620 crore) was approved of a total of Rs 6,200 crore revenue projection.A reality check shows that vends remain open for hours at several places in the city even after 6 pm. This, despite the fact that owners of other shops, many of which sell essential commodities, close their shops by 6pm and administration also make sure that these shops are closed by this time. However, there is no check on liquor vends timing. There are police check posts near many liquor vends in Bathinda city. Deputy commissioner B Srinivasan couldn’t be contacted despite repeated attempts. Assistant excise and taxation commissioner, Bathinda, RK Malhotra said that liquor vends are supposed to do business from 7am to 6pm. A liquor trader, however, said that a majority of liquor sale is done in the evening so it is not possible for them to shut vends by 6pm. Traders had already been claiming that reduced number of hours to keep open vends will also cause financial loss to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/liquor-vends-flout-lockdown-norms-remain-open-after-6pm-bathinda/story-HIVV9gmu3Swf0hAqF3GRyL.html

Meanwhile, in a letter submitted to the school administration, they demanded the school not to charge the fee as classes were not conducted for two months.“Your staff members send the homework through WhatsApp, which is not online study. Parents themselves are helping their children with the syllabus. Therefore, the fee demanded by you is illegal and amounts to unfair trade practice and cheating,” the memorandum read. The parents also demanded the school not to charge any annual fee and said, “We don’t want to purchase the books from the school. Rather than giving us discounts at such a time, they are charging more than the market rates.”Hemant Kumar, whose son studies in Class 3, said, “Even after the recent Punjab and Haryana high court order, which has allowed the school to charge 70% of the total fee, this school is asking us to pay the full amount by May 31. The DC has assured us that he will look into the matter.”Pradeep Singh, principal of the school, however, said that the parents will have to pay the fee. “Our teachers have worked hard throughout the lockdown to give online classes to students, but their salaries for April are still pending. Parents can pay the fee in any way, monthly, bimonthly or quarterly. There will be no concession in that,” she said. On the issue of charges of books, she said that all the books from class 6 to 12 are from NCERT and the parents don’t wish to purchase them from the school, can buy them anywhere from the market since they are easily available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/parents-hold-bike-rally-against-school-for-charging-fee-during-lockdown-in-ludhiana/story-Kg04P10oXPfUaqpQYn1CAI.html

This pandemic has taught us a lot. We should be ready to make lifestyle changes to move forward,” he added. Khattar said about 28 lakh people working in the private sector have returned to their jobs. “Hotels and restaurants have been allowed to resume home delivery. More relaxations could be in the offing after reviewing the situation by May 31,” he added.He said the number of Covid infected persons rose to 1,200 in the state, but situation in Haryana was far better than neighbouring Delhi, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. “We took measures and Delhi objected to them earlier, but now the situation is under control,” Khattar said. On the issue of private school fees, the chief minister said, “Fee is the only source of income of such schools. They have to meet expenses and pay salaries to their teachers and other staff.” Talking about payment to farmers, he admitted that there was a delay due to change in the system. “We are expecting that all the pending dues will soon be cleared.” About the movement of migrant labourers, he said state government had provided all support to the migrants. “Three lakh workers have already been sent, whereas about two lakh made their own arrangements. The government has also got requests from about 1 lakh more labourers and they will be sent back to their home states soon,” he added. On alleged atrocities on Hindus in Nuh, the chief minister said, “The matter was brought to my knowledge by Vishva Hindu Parishad. The situation is being monitored closely by the local police and action will be taken if anybody was found harming social harmony.” CM URGES FARMERS TO ADOPT DIVERSIFICATIONIn Kurukshetra earlier in the day, Khattar held a meeting to check depleting ground water level in the state. He also took feedback from selected farmers about the steps taken by the government for crop diversification. “The groundwater table has gone below 40 metres in several blocks, which is a matter of concern. The farmers should come forward to take advantage of the schemes announced by the government for crop diversification,” Khattar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hope-for-the-best-but-prepare-for-the-worst-khattar/story-xtFpZeZeAA78zgmb5dIxeL.html
26-05-2020||City||Farmer’s body seeks probe into spurious paddy seed scam||Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU-Lakhowal) general secretary Harinder Singh Lakhowal has demanded a probe by an independent agency into the alleged paddy seed scam by shop owners.He said the probe report should be submitted within 15 days and stringent action be taken against the accused.He said farmers of the state have been looted by a nexus of officials and spurious seed manufacturing agencies.Lakhowal said, “PAU sold only 250 quintals of PR 128 variety of rice seed and 3,000 quintals of PR 129 variety at Rs 70 per kg. But, private shop owners were selling spurious seed by claiming it to be that of PR 128 and PR 129 for Rs 200 to Rs 250 per kg.”He said the agricultural department’s raid on two shops selling spurious seed was merely an eyewash.After the recovery of a huge cache of spurious seed, no statewide raids were conducted and no efforts were made to find out how thousands of tons of counterfeit seed managed to reach the market. Lakhowal said even in the past, his union activists had caught shop owners selling spurious seed.“We had caught a shop owner in Bathinda for selling spurious seed. Similarly, a pesticide seller was caught red-handed selling fake pesticide meant for sugarcane. But, in both the cases, culprits was let off by department officials,” said Lakhowal.PAU had urged farmers not to buy spurious seed and recommended that only the seed of the varieties produced by PAU should be used by the farmers and that farmers should also not be misled by unrealistic yield claims made by seed sellers.The advisory by PAU has been issued in the backdrop of a raid conducted by agriculture and farmers’ welfare department of Punjab on Brar Seed Store situated opposite the university’s gate number 1 on May 11, for selling spurious seed. The officials confiscated seed samples, bill books and other documents. Besides, the police had also registered a case under Section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal Code and initiated investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmer-s-body-seeks-probe-into-spurious-paddy-seed-scam/story-qcIZof7j8xPbI61wV8K8AI.html

He said the accused called Deepak to a playground, where they attacked him with a sharp-edged weapon, killing him on the spot. Barwala station house officer (SHO) Kuldeep Singh said Ram Niwas and Mohit hatched a conspiracy to kill Deepak after the latter started interfering in the friendship between a woman and one of the accused (Ram Niwas).

26-05-2020||City||Punjab, Haryana may have crossed the peak in coronavirus cases: Expert||Punjab, Haryana and Kerala seem to have crossed the peak in coronavirus cases, says a prominent public health specialist, who expects India to keep Covid-19 deaths at less than 8,000 in the country with strict enforcement of standard protocols and hospitals in high alert.India should not be seen as one entity when it comes to tackling Covid-19, because the population size across sates and districts vary, health systems vary and level of literacy varies across and within states, said professor GVS Murthy, director of Indian Institute of Public Health, Hyderabad.Therefore, it will be more appropriate to talk about state-level and district-level peaks, he said.As against total cases per million population, which increased in India from 17.6 cases per million on April 25 to 99.9 per million on May 25, in Maharashtra it rose from 61.9/ million in April to 383/ million on May 25, Professor Murthy noted.In Tamil Nadu it increased from 23.4 per million on April 25 to 199.3 per million on May 25, and in Gujarat from 48.1 per million in April to 219 per million on May 25. Delhi has shown the steepest increase in the country from 140 per million on April 25 to 690 per million on May 25.“These states (Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Delhi) seem to be nearing the peak while those like Kerala, Punjab and Haryana seem to have crossed the peak,” Prof Murthy said.“Since six states (Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh) contribute 70% cases in the country, unless these states peak, the country peak cannot be reached.From the present trends, this can happen as early as early June to as late as the middle of July, he said|.On his assessment about “eventual” Covid-19 deaths in India, Professor Murthy said evidence from some models shows that nearly 80,000-100,000 deaths have been avoided due to the lockdown.He said data shows that the daily increase in deaths across the country has been two deaths per million population over the last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-haryana-may-have-crossed-the-peak-in-coronavirus-cases-expert/story-784eyllRRa4IuK9KDj4kcN.html
26-05-2020||Chandigarh||Is NOC from CARA mandatory for adoption: Punjab and Haryana HC to Centre||The Punjab and Haryana high court has asked ministry of external affairs (MEA) to apprise it whether for adoption under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA)-1956, no objection certificate (NOC) from the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) is mandatory. The response was sought on the plea from a two- year- old girl, adopted by an NRI couple. She was one of the twins born to a Jalandhar couple and subsequently adopted by NRI sister of her natural mother. They had applied for passport, but it was refused on the ground that there was no NOC from CARA. It is a statutory body for adoption of Indian children and is mandated to monitor and regulate in-country and inter-country adoptions. CARA is established under Juvenile Justice Act (JJA), 2015.The girl was born in November 2017 to a Sikh family in Jalandhar. She was adopted as per Sikh rites performed at a local Gurdwara as both the sides of parents were Sikhs to which a certificate too was issued. An adoption deed was executed between both the parents in November 2018 under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (as applicable to Sikhs). Thereafter, the family applied for girl’s passport which was rejected by authorities stating that NOC from CARA was mandatory.As per petitioner girl’s advocate SS Nara, Section 56 (3) of the JJ Act 2015 states that the provisions of the JJ Act would not be applicable to the adoption of children made under the provisions of HAMA, latter being a ‘special law’. JJ Act does not override the provisions of HAMA Act, it was argued adding that in view of this passport cannot be denied. On the other hand, Central government counsel had argued it is a mandatory procedure for the adoption to be ratified by CARA, even though JJ Act would not be applicable to an adoption under HAMA. There are notifications which categorically state that the Hague Convention itself mandates adoptions to be through CARA alone, the counsel had added. The bench of justice Jaishree Thakur sought Centre’s response observing that a pertinent question has been raised whether an NOC is to be obtained and whether the provisions of the JJ Act would apply to adoptions under HAMA. “Let a detailed reply be filed by the respondents raising all objections therein and by placing on record all notifications as relied upon,” the bench said posting the matter for June 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/is-noc-from-cara-mandatory-for-adoption-punjab-and-haryana-hc-to-centre/story-9ntET8ipueoMkTRS45pPrO.html
26-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab no more among 10 worst coronavirus-hit states||In what is being seen as a relief to the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Punjab government, the state does not figure on the list of India’s 10 worst coronavirus-hit states anymore. The state now is on the 12th position, the latest data shows. It was on May 3 when Punjab, after a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases in the wake of the return of pilgrims to Takht Hazur Sahib in Maharashtra’s Nanded, entered the list of 10 worst-hit states.The state improved in ranking as Bihar (2,686) and Karnataka (2,180) added several cases in past few days, as per the data of the Union health and family welfare ministry till May 25. As per the government’s figures, Punjab has reported 2,081 cases so far.The 10 worst-affected states are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh apart from Bihar and Karnataka. Punjab’s neighbouring state Haryana was on 16th rank whereas Jammu and Kashmir is on 14th place. A sharp decline in new cases is the last fortnight or so is being seen as the biggest reason behind Punjab’s exit from the list of 10 worst-hit states. In the in last 10 days, the state has reported 135 new cases, a moderate spike when compared with many states.Also, the state’s doubling rate has improved in the last three weeks. The rate, which was just three days on May 5, has now increased to 98 days. As against 4-5% daily increase in cases as per national figures, the state’s increase in cases varies between 0 and 1% in the past week.Already, Punjab is on the top among all the states in terms of patients’ recovery rate which is over 92%, more than double the national average.Four districts — Ferozepur, Mansa, Moga and Taran Taran — have reported no new cases in the last two weeks. SAS Nagar and Sangrur, which too had no fresh cases during the same period, had fresh cases on Tuesday.On Tuesday, six districts — Rupnagar, Moga, Fatehgarh Sahib, Ferozepur, Fazilka and Mansa — had no Covid-19 case, while SAS Nagar, Sangrur, Muktsar, Faridkot, Bathinda and Barnala have active case presently.“All this is the result of our containment strategy and the strong follow-up by our teams monitoring the suspected patients. If all goes well, we will improve further in the coming days,” state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-no-more-among-10-worst-coronavirus-hit-states/story-G2YG6cj0bFcljot0fGK4fO.html

PAU experts have prepared an audio clip which is being circulated in the Abhor belt located near the Rajasthan border.Varsity’s entomology department head PK Chhuneja said the swarms could cover 150-200 km in a day. “Since the first week of May, locusts have tried to intrude fields in Punjab areas on three occasions. But the Punjab government has chalked out a comprehensive plan to tackle the situation,” said Chhuneja.‘INFORM AGRI DEPT OR NEAREST CIRCLE OFFICE’ The PAU has urged the farmers to inform the agriculture department, the varsity or the nearest locust circle office in case they spot a swarm in their area besides keeping their pesticide sprays ready to tackle attack.“During the daytime, the hopping locusts can be crushed under vehicles with wide wheels. The flying ones can be scared away by creating loud drumming sounds or by using torches during night,” the PAU advisory read.“Their movement happened due to heavy rainfall in the desert areas. The full-gown locust will attack the area according to the availability of food,” said Dr Chhuneja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pau-sounds-alert-on-likely-locust-attack-issues-advisory-to-farmers/story-gt9MTpYNfvnDM4Gsbh7ziK.html

The PIL had sought directions to set up full-fledged Covid-19 testing facilities in Ratnagiri after a rise in the number of persons returning from Mumbai and Pune which were declared hotspots of the novel coronavirus. The plea had stated that in light of the growing number of suspected Covid cases, the state should set up additional testing facilities in Ratnagiri.A division bench of chief justices Dipankar Datta and K K Tated, while hearing the PIL by Khalil Ahmad Hasanmiya Wasta, a 58-year-old fisherman, through video conferencing, was informed by advocate Rakesh Bhatkar that since the state allowed intra-state travelling during the lockdown, around 60,000 people from Mumbai and Pune had arrived in the Konkan region namely Ratnagiri, Raigad and Sindhudurg. Bhatkar had further submitted that before the lifting of travel ban there were only seven Covid-19 positive cases in Ratnagiri, however the same went up to 108 after migrants and students returned from Mumbai and Pune. He added that as swab samples were being sent to Sangli and Miraj which are 237 km away, reports of suspected coronavirus infected persons were getting delayed and hence, full-fledged testing labs should be set up in Ratnagiri to avoid the delay.After hearing the submissions on Tuesday, the court sought to know the status of such testing facilities in each district and directed government pleader Priyabhushan Kakade to take instructions regarding the same and inform the court on the next date of hearing on May 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-asks-state-to-give-details-of-covid-19-testing-facilities-in-all-districts/story-DKTxgC80z3tBGjOR2eW9eL.html

26-05-2020||City||J&K resident alleges chaos, negligence at sample collection centre in Kathua||It’s been over two months since the Covid-19 lockdown was enforced across India, but the allegations of mismanagement and chaos at quarantine and sample collection centres refuse to die down in Jammu and Kashmir.Recalling a nightmarish experience at a sample collection centre set up in Radha Soami Ashram in Thandi Khui area of Samba district, a 35-year-old man said, “I spent two nights with my wife and children, aged eight months and two years, in my car at the ashram as there was huge rush of people returning to J&K. In the name of social distancing and hygiene, there was only one common bathroom, which was dirty, and the mere thought of it being used by infected persons sent shivers down my spine.”Hussain had applied for inter-state travel on April 22 to bring home his wife and two children from Himachal Pradesh’s Nurpur. He was eventually given permission on May 17 and his ordeal began on May 19.“On May 19, I left Bari Brahmana in Samba district in my car, reached Nurpur and returned with my wife and two children the same evening, but our samples were taken on May 21 around 3.30pm,” he said.Thereafter, Hussain was shifted on May 21 evening to a quarantine centre where he was kept for five more days.Our samples were sent to GMCH Srinagar and after we got a message on our phone that we had been tested negative, we were issued a pass to go home, he said.A senior doctor at the Government Medical College and Hospital, Jammu, admitted that there was mismanagement on the part of the administration.“Sample reports are being delayed because there is a massive burden on the testing labs. I have requested the administration to streamline the system. For instance, limit of samples should be set according to the testing capacity of all the labs,” the senior doctor said.In all, J&K has four government testing labs.The doctor recalled a recent event wherein 70 returnees were brought to GMCH Jammu in a bus for testing.“They told me that their samples had not been taken for the past seven days. They were full of other complaints. In the scorching heat, they were dropped at the hospital by a naib tehsildar. This is how the administration is combating Covid-19,” he said.Recently, J&K returnees housed in quarantine centres like MA Stadium in Jammu, Dhalwas and Dharmund in Ramban had complained about poor food, inadequate water and plastic bedsheets.When asked about the alleged negligence, Samba district magistrate Rohit Khajuria said, “We have put up barricades and made separate enclosures to ensure social distancing, but when 2,000 people come at once and say 10 among them defy the protocol, it is hard to check that. Cops cannot be deployed with each and every person.”On the delay in sampling reports, he said initially there was pendency, but now everything has been streamlined.“For the past three to four days, there has been no pendency. Initially, J&K had only two government testing labs, but now there are four and some private as well. Testing capacity has been increased to 8,000 tests per day. When there is such a big task at hand, it takes time to streamline things,” Khajuria said.Khajuria also clarified that the said ashram has 500 toilets and as many bathrooms, which all are clean.“In fact, the ashram office-bearers revealed that many people were not using the toilets, but defecating on the premises. People themselves were creating a mess,” he added.About the re-sampling, he said it might have happened in “two or three cases”. “It is easy to criticise. Ask these people to come and work with us for 10 days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-resident-alleges-chaos-negligence-at-sample-collection-centre-in-kathua/story-W2cEBZ3S0QkiyvXkMChM9I.html

26-05-2020||City||Major relief to commuters: 3 flyover projects of NH-44 opened for traffic in Ludhiana||In a major relief for Ludhiana residents, the long pending projects of three flyovers under National Highway-44 (Jalandhar-Panipat project) have been completed, with deputy commissioner (DC) Pradeep Agrawal opening the Sherpur Chowk flyover for traffic on Monday.Now, traffic coming from Jalandhar will not have to enter the city to reach Delhi and vice versa, reducing the vehicular rush on Ludhiana roads.The projects were to be completed by March 31, 2020, but the work was delayed due to the nationwide lockdown. The Basti Jodhewal bridge was opened for traffic in November last year, while both sides of Sherpur Chowk and Cancer Hospital flyover were opened this month. Punjab road safety council member Rahul Verma said, “The three flyovers worth around 75 crore have been completed and opened for traffic. A temporary down ramp has also been established to facilitate the entry of light vehicles coming from Cancer Hospital side to Sherpur Chowk. Moreover, the administration is in talks with the NHAI to establish permanent entry and exit points at Sherpur Chowk and near Jalandhar Bypass.”“The expansion project of Laddowal toll plaza is going on and it is expected that the service lane being established over the Buddha Nullah, near Tibba road, would be opened for traffic in around two weeks”, he said. DC Agrawal said, “Even though the flyovers have been completed, there are still many issues such as Tajpur road cut, entry exit points on the highway, etc, for which we are coordinating with the NHAI.” PROJECT HANGING FIRE FOR OVER 10 YEARSThe three flyover projects in the city -- Basti Jodhewal, Sherpur Chowk and the one near Mohan Dai Oswal Cancer hospital -- were hanging fire for over ten years, giving the commuters a harrowing time. The project had commenced in 2008 and was to be completed by 2011, but the construction work was put to a halt in 2010 due to some issues between the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the construction company.It restarted last year after Congress leader including member of Parliament (MP) Ravneet Singh Bittu, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, mayor Balkar Sandhu, members of legislative assembly (MLAs) Sanjay Talwar, Surinder Dawar and others staged a two-day protest at Laddowal toll plaza in March, ahead of Lok Sabha elections. SINGLE SPAN FLYOVER AT TAJPUR ROAD CUTApart from the above said projects, the authorities are working on a bridge at Tajpur road cut under change of scope (COS) plans. As a large number of residents cross the highway from Tajpur road cut, they had demanded a passage to cross the road after the completion of the highway project. As there is no cut, the residents have to travel till Basti Jodhewal or Samrala Chowk to cross the road. As per the information, retired municipal corporation (MC) engineer MPS Kalra has been appointed as consultant for Punjab region by NHAI. He said that they have commenced a survey to establish a single-span flyover which would connect Kailash Nagar with Tajpur Road. “The survey report would soon be submitted with the NHAI authorities,” he said. Earlier, there was a plan to establish vehicular underpass at the point.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/major-relief-to-commuters-3-flyover-projects-of-nh-44-opened-for-traffic-in-ludhiana/story-qkMrJX9rdV1mcotDFUUU8I.html
26-05-2020||Mumbai||PIL against Wadia Hospitals: HC asks petitioner to deposit Rs 1 cr to prove his bonafides||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed Dadar resident Dr Pankaj Phadnis, who has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking an investigation into the functioning of Wadia Hospitals at Parel, to deposit Rs 1 crore in two days to prove his bonafides. The bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice KK Tated issued the order after both the hospitals--Bai Jerabai Wadia Children’s Hospital and Nowrosjee Wadia Maternity Hospital--took strong objections to the PIL.Dr Phadnis has filed the PIL through Abhinav Bharat Congress, an organization that he founded. Apart from the investigation into financial aspects of the hospitals, they have also sought a direction to the state authorities to take over the hospitals.The hospital management objected to the maintainability of the PIL on the ground that under Bombay High Court PIL Rules, 2010, an unregistered body has no locus standi to initiate a proceeding in the nature of a PIL.The hospital management also pointed that over a decade ago, Dr Phadnis was in the employment of the Wadias and that this PIL was filed for furthering his agenda. They added that Dr Phadnis had unsuccessfully initiated proceedings against the Wadias in a United States court and that the PIL was nothing but an abuse of the processes of the court.The bench noted that the petitioner had not disclosed these facts in the PIL, nor had he controverted the statements in his reply to their affidavit.The omissions gave the prima facts “reason to believe that this PIL petition may not have been filed in public interest but for ulterior and oblique motives, and that the bonafide of the petitioner no.2 (Dr. Phadnis) is suspect.”The bench has now asked the petitioner to deposit Rs 1 crore by Thursday with the hC registry. If the deposit is made, the PIL is ordered to be placed for further hearing on Friday, May 29, otherwise, it will be dismissed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pil-against-wadia-hospitals-hc-asks-petitioner-to-deposit-rs-1-cr-to-prove-his-bonafides/story-pF5QtzNz8Dob2pPyM9Sg5N.html

26-05-2020||Lucknow||Adityanath makes u-turn, UP says no permission needed to hire its workers||Two days after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said other states will also need permission from the state for engaging its workers, his government said Tuesday that it would not incorporate, in the migration commission bye-laws, the ‘prior permission’ clause for states seeking to employ manpower from UP.The government also said it was working on modalities to set up the commission to provide jobs and social security to migrant workers returning to the state. It has named the migration commission as the ‘Kamgar/shramik (sewajojan and rozgar) kalyan ayog (Workers/labourers employment welfare commission). About 26 lakh migrants have already returned to the state and an exercise to map their skills is being carried out to help them get jobs.On Tuesday, Adityanath discussed the modalities for setting up the commission and told his officers to complete the skill mapping exercise in 15 days.“The chief minister discussed the modalities for setting up the commission, as well. There will be no provision requiring other states to seek UP government’s prior permission for employing our manpower. The commission is being set up with to provide jobs and social security to the workers. We will also link the migrants to the government schemes to provide them houses and loans etc,” said a senior officer, who didn’t want to be named.Adityanath said a letter should be sent to all state governments to find out about migrant workers willing to come back to Uttar Pradesh. Speaking at a webinar on Sunday, the CM had said: “The migration commission will work in the interest of migrant workers. If any other state wants UP’s manpower, they cannot take them away just like that but will have to seek permission of the UP government. The way our migrant workers were ill-treated in other states, the UP government will take their insurance, social security in its hands now. The state government will stand by them wherever they work, whether in Uttar Pradesh, other states or other countries.”The ‘permission’ statement sparked a row with some political leaders and parties questioning it.Earlier in the day, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi had severely criticized Adityanath’s stand saying the workers were not the chief minister’s personal property.“It is very unfortunate that the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh views India in such a way. These people are not his personal property. They are not the personal property of Uttar Pradesh. These people are Indian citizens and they have the right to decide what they want to do and they have the right to live the life they want to live,” Gandhi said.On Monday, MNS chief Raj Thackeray had taken on Adityanath with a warning that if UP insists on “permission” before other states can to employ workers from there, “then any migrant entering Maharashtra would need to take permissions from us, from the Maharashtra state, our police force. Shri Adityanath needs to take cognizance of this. Also, the Maharashtra government needs to look into this matter seriously. In future, whenever migrants do enter our state, they will need to be registered and their personal details and identification proof will need to be submitted to the police station. Only if these requirements are met, will they be allowed to enter Maharashtra.”Explaining Adityanath’s point on the issue, the officer quoted earlier said, “The chief minister is deeply moved by the condition of migrants. They have been treated badly by other states. So, when the CM spoke about the need for seeking UP government’s permission, he did so in the role of a guardian for workers. It’s only the CM’s concern for the migrants that came out as a political statement,” said the officer while asserting that Yogi’s statement was in no way out of context.Meanwhile, CB Pandey, a legal expert, said: “The migration commission can work as a welfare body and watch the interests of the workmen. But most of the migrant workers are employed in the unorganized sector.The state government can regulate only the recruitment agencies, if any. In more than 99 per cent of cases, no recruitment agencies are involved. Majority of workers of the unorganized sector look for jobs through their acquaintances or family members and regulating them may not be possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/adityanath-makes-u-turn-up-says-no-permission-needed-to-hire-its-workers/story-CbhCHUieWvUwxmzT1CscyO.html

26-05-2020||Mumbai||Catholics approach Archdiocese to allow burials of Covid-19 victims in local cemeteries||A week after the municipal corporation listed four cemeteries where bodies of Christians who pass away of Covid 19 can be buried, members of the Roman Catholic community approached the Archdiocese of Bombay asking for more cemeteries attached to churches to accept such burials.The development comes after HT first reported that a family from Mahim was forced to cremate the body of a 61-year-old woman who passed away from Covid-19 after cemeteries refused to provide burial space.“Despite the high court order, there are not enough cemeteries which are accepting bodies of Covid-19 victims. Which is why a representative submitted a letter to the Archdiocese on our behalf. If they don’t accept the request, we plan to move court. Burial is not being allowed even in family graves. The cemeteries attached to the church need to allow burial just as four BMC cemeteries have been asked to,” said Melwyn Fernandes of Association of Concerned Catholic (AOCC), who has submitted the application.According to community activists, around 20 such forced cremations would have taken place ever since the lockdown guidelines were enforced. However, there are no official figures available with authorities. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had earlier said that bodies of all Covid-19 victims will have to be cremated, but later earmarked burial grounds for Muslims. This led to demands from Christian groups for burial permissions.Some approached the Bombay High Court which said burials should be allowed. The court last week, observed that there was no scientific data to support the claim that Covid-19 can spread through dead bodies and that the BMC had all the authority to demarcate the cemetery. However, Father Nigel Barett, spokesperson of the Archdiocese, said that burial order comes from the BMC. “If BMC gives the order to bury a body, then it is on the trustees of that cemetery to decide whether they want to accept the body or not. There are no guidelines in place by BMC about the handling of dead bodies and when the grave can be opened again, without which everyone is scared to handle the body. Otherwise, the church would be blamed for spreading the virus,” said Barett.The Archdiocese of Bombay has around five lakh members under its jurisdiction. All across Mumbai, Thane, Raigad district and Mahad, there are 122 churches of Roman Catholic denomination, with approximately 60 cemeteries attached to them. Earlier, there have been four burials that have taken place at Deonar cemetery, of which two families were from Dharavi. Over the weekend, the burial of a member from a Roman Catholic church from Vakola took place at Mahalakshmi.“Deonar cemetery is really small, they can only accept a limited number of bodies. They have now requested us to not get any bodies because as there is no space. Some bigger cemeteries like Sewri, which are under the jurisdiction of BMC, are not accepting Covid 19 bodies,” said Cyril Dara, secretary of Christian reform united people association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/catholics-approach-archdiocese-to-allow-burials-of-covid-19-victims-in-local-cemeteries/story-ne4BjgcrkTu4p4o3UtFb3N.html

Despite telling them I was the CMO and had urgent official work, they didn’t listen,” said CMO Tajamul Hussain.Following this, the CMO got off the vehicle and shouted his concerns at the police. “Complete health system will fall without us. Can’t you see this is CMO’s vehicle? You are harassing doctors. Yesterday, you beat up a doctor in Srinagar. Are we coming out for ourselves? We are risking our lives to save the people,” the CMO is seen saying in a video of the incident now doing rounds on social media.A cop on duty is seen telling the CMO to talk to the SP concerned.Hussain said he was only allowed to proceed after the Bandipora deputy commissioner (DC) intervened in the matter. “They (police) will not let us work,” the CMO lamented.Meanwhile, Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK) has announced a black-band protest across the Union territory following the recent incidents in which doctors were allegedly manhandled, harassed and not allowed to reach hospitals.“We are announcing a one day black band protest on Wednesday over the excesses by government forces against healthcare providers,” said DAK president Dr Suhail Naik.The Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) of Government Medical College and Hospital, Srinagar, has also condemned the incident calling it ‘highly unfortunate’.

26-05-2020||City||Gurugram to fund garbage collection in Faridabad||Gurugram: The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will incur expenses for waste collection in Faridabad, where the lockdown has further hit cash-strapped local civic body’s revenues, said officials on Monday.MCG officials said the Faridabad civic body was further short of funds and unable to pay the tipping fees to the waste collection concessionaire Ecogreen Private Limited for April. Subsequently, the Haryana government directed MCG to pay tipping fees to Ecogreen on behalf of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) from this month. “The state government asked us to pay our waste concessionaire the tipping fees for the MCF starting this month. Accordingly, we have complied and started helping MCF monetarily,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.In August 2017, the MCG, MCF, and Haryana government signed a joint-agreement with Ecogreen for the door-to-door collection of waste in Gurugram and Faridabad. As part of the agreement, the two civic bodies have to pay Ecogreen ₹1,000 for every tonne of waste collected as ‘tipping fees’ on a monthly basis. According to Ecogreen officials, they collect around 1,200 tonnes of waste from Gurugram every day and 900 tonnes from Faridabad. The MCF pays around ₹2.5-3 crore for waste collection in Faridabad and MCG pays ₹3.5-4 crore every month, depending on the final load. Singh said the MCG is paying the tipping fees on behalf of the MCF as a loan, and the Faridabad civic body is expected to pay the sum back when their finances are more stable.In 2010, just two years after its formation, the MCG had lent ₹150 crore to the MCF. A decade later, MCG officials said these dues are yet to be cleared and added that they wouldn’t be funding MCF for any other aspect besides waste collection, unless the state government states otherwise.MCF was formed in 1993.“MCF is facing a financial crunch presently. Although they didn’t list an exact reason, I believe that to ensure the continuity of services, the state government asked MCG to pay Ecogreen on behalf of MCF. Ultimately, these funds between the MCG and MCF have to be settled and we will be paying MCG for all pending dues,” said Yash Garg, commissioner, MCF.Garg said the MCG is only paying funds for waste collection and nothing else, as it is one of the primary signatories in the agreement between Ecogreen, and the two civic bodies.“The Haryana government has issued a circular stating that the MCG would be paying tipping fees on behalf of MCF. It is simply an understanding between two municipal corporations,” said an official spokesperson for Ecogreen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-to-fund-garbage-collection-in-faridabad/story-YZvH8cTZKWpBltPHc4FugP.html
26-05-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 cases surge in Himachal, state braces for a long-drawn battle||Himachal was on the brink of being declared Covid-free when the state witnessed a surge in coronavirus cases from May 4.Confident that the state had seen the last of the deadly disease, Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur had said the state will become Covid-free by May 5. However, it seems the state is in for a long-drawn battle as the Covid-19 tally of the state has already crossed the 200-mark and cases continue to increase relentlessly.THE SECOND WAVEHimachal had reported its first Covid-19 case on March 20 in Kangra. On April 23, the toll stood at 40 cases, including one fatality. It seemed the worst was behind the state, when no cases were reported till May 3. However, the spell was broken after Himachal opened its borders to facilitate the return of those stranded in other states, triggering a second wave.From May 13, the Shramik special train also started ferrying Himachal residents from Mumbai, which significantly contributed to the spike in cases.FASTER DOUBLING, SLOWER RECOVERYSpecial secretary (health) Nipun Jindal said at present, the doubling rate of Covid-19 cases in Himachal was 5.9 days, which is troubling as the national average is 15.1 days. Just a week ago, the doubling rate of the disease in Himachal was 10.7 days.The doubling rate sharply increased after a sudden spike in cases after May 20, when Himachal’s Covid-19 tally crossed the 100-mark, two months (61 days) after it recorded its first case.However, the 200-mark was breached within four days or 65 days after the first case was reported in the state.Over the week, 125 people have tested positive for the disease in the state.“The fatality rate of the state is 2.38% against the national average of 2.57%,” Jindal said, adding the recovery rate was 30% against the national average of 41%.However, the state’s testing rate is 3,554 people per million, which is better than the national testing rate of 2,488 per million, Jindal said.90% CASES ARE RETURNEES Around 90% of the cases recorded during the second surge are returnees. Most of them have travelled back from Mumbai and Delhi. Others came back from Chennai, Bangalore, Goa, West Bengal and Gujarat.As per government data, around 1.30 lakh migrants have returned to the state since April.Around 6,000 people have returned in Shramik special trains while others travelled in private vehicles and buses deployed by the state government.ALL RETURNEES IN INSTITUTIONAL QUARANTINE The silver lining amid the grim readings is that most of the returnees found positive were institutionally quarantined and there is no community transmission.Only one case of community transmission has been reported from Chamba where a Covid-19 positive man infected four others.WORST HIT, COVID-FREE DISTRICTSHamirpur, Kangra and Una are the worst hit districts in the state accounting for 68% of the cases. Till date, Hamirpur has reported 63 cases, followed by Kangra with 59 cases and Una with 30 cases.Kangra has the highest population while Hamirpur has the highest population density in the state. A significant number of people in both states are working in other states.WHAT LIES NEXT?The Covid-19 cases in the state are likely to increase in the coming days. Till date, the state has tested 28,000 samples for Covid-19. Given, the large number of returnees who are yet to be tested, there seems to be no relief in the near future. The state government has now authorised district magistrates to extend the lockdown, if the situation requires, till June 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-cases-surge-in-himachal-state-braces-for-a-long-drawn-battle/story-6rRHChxFpjaAf1tqiVY0YI.html

26-05-2020||Chandigarh||No homes, and now this heat: No respite for migrant workers in Ludhiana||Without homes, sitting out in the open, waiting for train or bus tickets to return to their homes in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (UP), migrant workers camping near the Guru Nanak Stadium have been hit hard by soaring temperatures in a city that recorded its hottest day this year at 44 degrees Celsius on Tuesday.Many children at the camp appeared tired and listless while infants cried as their parents frantically tried to keep them cool with hand fans fashioned out of cardboard and plastic. Many were dipping pieces of cloth in water and wiping down the bodies of the children.Several migrants took shelter under trees in the well-maintained gardens outside the homes of bureaucrats, judicial and police officials living in the area.For the migrants, it’s one blow after another with the Covid-19 outbreak rendering them jobless and the heatwave adding to their misery.They say they have no place for shelter as they have vacated their rented accommodation and are camping on the roads. “We can endure the scorching summer but seeing the children cry because of the heat disturbs us,” said Shambhu Nath, a resident of Gorakhpur in UP sitting on the pavement outside Rakh Bagh near Guru Nanak Stadium.Shiv Ram, also waiting to board a train to UP, said he could not wait to get back home.Meanwhile, the health department has issued an advisory to people to protect themselves from the severe heat wave. Civil surgeon Rajesh Bagga has asked the department to maintain a record of heat stroke patients being admitted in hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-homes-and-now-this-heat-no-respite-for-migrant-workers-in-ludhiana/story-cCsDkCHtUk56BV4lNJ9NPL.html
26-05-2020||Chandigarh||Heatwave enforces lockdown in the north as some cities register record highs||As heatwave conditions prevailed in the region due to dry winds blowing over northwest, central and adjoining interior parts of eastern India, Chandigarh recorded a high of 42.4 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, Amritsar and Ludhiana 44 degrees and Patiala 43.2 degrees, even as the India meteorological department (IMD) advised people to stay indoors and said some relief was expected by March 28.Ludhiana recorded its highest temperature this summer.No respite was forecast for Amritsar till after May 27, after which spells of rain were expected. The lockdown due to Covid-19 was making things worse, said resident Gurleen Kaur, “as we are forced to go out to buy essential items and stand in the sun for long hours because of social distancing.” Drinking water was the best option, said Amritsar based Dr Rakesh Sharma, adding, “people should also keep their body dry to avoid skin infections.”‘HEAT STROKE CAN BE DANGEROUS’In Patiala, apart from the lockdown, the heat kept people indoors, with Patiala civil surgeon Dr Harish Malhotra saying the IMD had predicted a severe heat wave with maximum temperatures likely to cross 45°C. Advising people to exercise caution, he said “such high temperatures can lead to a heat stroke, resulting in physiological strain and even death.”“Wear lightweight, light-coloured, loose and porous cotton clothes and when outside, use protective goggles, umbrella or a hat,” the civil surgeon added, saying children should also not be allowed outIMD’s deputy director general of meteorology, KS Hosalikar in Delhi, cautioned people to “watch out for hot afternoons and avoid going out between 11 am and 3 pm,” PTI reported.WHAT NOT TO DOAvoid alcohol, tea, coffee and carbonated soft drinks, as they dehydrate the body Avoid high-protein food Do not leave children or pets in parked vehicles or allow them to play outdoors in the afternoonIn Ludhiana, Prabhjyot Kaur, head of the department of school of climate change and agricultural meteorology, said maximum temperatures were expected to stay above 40 degrees, which would be helpful in creating low pressures, favourable for the advancing monsoon current towards the north. Kaur also said western disturbances leading to moderate rainfall by May 29 would bring some respite from the heat in the city.Heatwave conditions would persist over Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, east Madhya Pradesh, and Vidarbha till May 28, IMD officials saidNo one was taking risks. “Due to the lockdown earlier I was stepping out of home only when necessary, but now I go out only in the evening, said Ranvinder Singh Gill, a resident of Chandigarh’s Sector 8.WHAT TO DO Use oral rehydration therapy (ORS), homemade drinks like lassi, torani (rice water), lime water, buttermilkCover hats, use umbrella and wear sunglasses when outdoorsThose affected by sun stroke should be given first-aid immediately, their heads bathed with water (room temperature) and bodies wiped with wet towels to bring down body temperature before they are taken to hospitalAs staying dehydrated was necessary, Gill said he had stocked up on lemons and was making the cooling shikanji with lemon juice and black salt.Chirag Puri, an e-commerce firm employee currently working from home said he found it unbearably warm while getting his car repaired at a workshop. “I am keeping hydrated with glucose and mango shakes and won’t be stepping out now from 1 pm to 5 pm from my house.”Things were also not easy for traffic policemen. On how they coped, constable Rajiv Sharma said, “We make it a point not to stand in direct sunlight for long and keep moving. We have to keep drinking water so we bring lime water from home to help us.” People in the shops and local residents offered them lemonade in the afternoons, he said.WESTERN DISTURBANCE TO BRING RELIEFChandigarh IMD scientist Shivinder Singh said the heatwave in the region had been caused by hot surface winds blowing in from Rajasthan, where at some stations the maximum temperature had crossed 47 degrees C.Some respite was possible by Thursday when a western disturbance was likely to affect the region. “Cloudy weather and a chance of light rain up to 20mm along with gusty winds up to 40km are likely to bring the maximum temperature back in the 30s,” he said.UT director health services Dr G Dewan also issued an advisory on Tuesday, asking people to avoid direct exposure to sunlight, staying indoors in well ventilated areas and avoiding electric fans when temperatures shot up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/heatwave-enforces-lockdown-in-the-north-as-some-cities-register-record-highs/story-AMk779NB8lQVyVvJBXX5cI.html

26-05-2020||Mumbai||145 Shramik Special trains planned for Maharashtra, only 13 run so far: Railways||As the feud between the Maharashtra government and the Railways refuses to die down, the national transporter on Tuesday accused the state of not providing information about passengers as a result of which many Shramik Special trains could not be run.Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal tweeted that the Railways had planned 145 trains for Tuesday but only 13 trains could be run till 3.00 pm due to lack of passengers.“On request of Maharashtra govt, we arranged 145 Shramik Special Trains today. These trains are ready since morning. Fifty trains were to leave till 3 pm but only 13 trains have due to lack of passengers.“I request Maharashtra government to fully cooperate in ensuring that the distressed migrants are able to reach their homes and bring passengers to stations in time, and not cause further delays. It will affect the entire network and planning,” Goyal tweeted. Earlier, the Railways had issued statements saying that it planned 125 trains for evacuating migrants from Maharashtra on May 25 but the state government was only able to give information for 41 trains till 2 am.“Out of these 41 trains, only 39 trains could run as passengers could not be brought by local authorities and these two trains had to be cancelled.“After meticulous planning and sustained effort, the Railways mobilised its resources at a very short notice and prepared 145 Shramik trains to depart from Maharashtra on May 26,” a statement issued by the Railways said.“Till 12 noon, 25 trains were planned from Maharashtra to run but no departure could happen due to lack of passengers. Boarding of the first train could only commence at CSMT at 12.30 pm,” it said.According to the Railways, 68 trains were planned to depart for Uttar Pradesh, 27 to Bihar, 41 to West Bengal, one each to Chattisgarh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Kerala and two each to Odisha and Tamil Nadu.Over the past two days, a political slugfest over Shramik Special trains had begun between Goyal and the Maharashtra government with the state alleging that not enough trains were being provided to them.Goyal on Sunday night said, “We are ready to provide 125 Shramik Special trains to Maharashtra.” “Since you have said that you have a list ready that is why I am requesting you to please provide all information like from where the train will run, the list of passengers according to the trains, their medical certificate and where the train is to go, to the General Manager of Central Railway within the next hour, so that we can plan the time of trains,” he had tweeted.Commenting on it, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Monday tweeted, “Maharashtra government has given you a list of workers who wish to return home. The only request is that the train should reach the station, as announced earlier.” “The Gorakhpur-bound train had reached Odisha,” the Sena’s Rajya Sabha member further said.He also asked Goyal if the Ministry of Railways had made any such list while running the Nagpur-Udhampur migrant train on May 14.

26-05-2020||Delhi||Traffic snarls at Ghaziabad’s UP-Gate border after authorities restrict movement to Delhi||Heavy traffic jams were reported in Ghaziabad at UP-Gate border near east Delhi on Tuesday morning after the city police restricted movement of vehicles to the national capital following an order by the district magistrate. The Ghaziabad district administration on Monday issued directions once again restricting the movement of commuters to Delhi and said they will be need passes if they wished to travel to Delhi. Those in exempted categories will be allowed to pass, they said.“There were jams at the border as we conducted checks in compliance of the order by the district magistrate. We have opened the UP-Gate and Anand Vihar-Kaushambi border for commuters but they are allowed passage to Delhi only on the basis of passes issued by the administration,” Anshu Jain, Indirapuram’s circle officer, said.“So far, we have allowed passage to vehicles involved in essential service through the flyover at UP-Gate. So such vehicles entering Delhi without any hindrance. Below the flyover, we are trying to create separate lanes for different categories of commuters. The plan will be put in place after discussions,” she added.Jaivir Singh from Vaishali in Ghaziabad, one of those stuck at UP-Gate, said he was not allowed entry to Delhi without a pass.“I reached the border but was sent back as the cops said that I need to get a valid pass to go to Delhi. The Delhi government has opened offices and the Ghaziabad cops did not allow entry through my official identification card,” Singh, who works with the municipal corporation of Delhi, said.“So, I came back after waiting for about an hour. There was no point in waiting at the border in the scorching summer heat,” he added.He added that for past about a week, the movement at the border was eased and there was no such issue.Like Singh, Neeraj Kumar also goes to Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar, where he works with a private company involved in sales of cars.“The cops did not allow me entry to Delhi and I had to return back. They asked me to apply for passes in order to move to Delhi. Now, I have told my office to apply for passes. Till then I will have to wait,” Kumar, a resident of Sanjay Nagar in Ghaziabad, said.“Generally, we find jams at the border while coming home in the evening. Then, the cops make strict checks of ID cards and passes while allowing us into Ghaziabad jurisdiction from Delhi. But now they have started similar checks in the morning which has resulted in the jam at the UP-Gate border. Many commuters were told to return and not allowed entry to Delhi without a pass,” he added.The Ghaziabad administration in an order on Monday evening had issued directions for restricting the movement citing that people travelling to Delhi were getting infected with Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and a number of such cases emerged, majorly in the month of May.Vehicles engaged in essential services have been allowed to move without any restrictions while doctors, paramedical staff, police and bank employees will be asked to produce their identification cards.Likewise, media persons and lawyers can also cross the borders after showing their identity cards. However, employees of private firms with offices in Delhi will have to apply for passes.The order also states that commuters are advised to leave Ghaziabad maximum by 9am and return only after 6pm. Officials said those wanting to travel to Delhi can apply for passes at http://164.100.68.164/upepass2/.“The persons coming from hotspot areas of Delhi will not be allowed entry to Ghaziabad. Likewise, no one will be allowed entry to any hotspot areas in Ghaziabad. Even, anyone residing in hotspot areas of Ghaziabad will be allowed to move out except for those involved in essential services,” the directions by the district magistrate, said.In a decision taken earlier on April 20, the district magistrate under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act had prohibited any travel between Ghaziabad and Delhi except for those involved in essential services or having valid passes.Officials said Monday’s direction was an extension of the May 18 lockdown 4.0 guidelines issued by the Uttar Pradesh government.Under the May 18 directions of chief secretary RK Tiwari, commuters from Delhi, other than those from hotspots, were allowed to travel to the National Capital Region (NCR) areas of Noida and Ghaziabad and the district administration was asked to issue detailed directions in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/traffic-snarls-at-ghaziabad-s-up-gate-border-after-authorities-restrict-movement-to-delhi/story-uLQzpLHCrgSiPAWAZz1rOP.html
26-05-2020||Patna||‘BJP richest party in world, doesn’t care for poor’: Tejashwi Yadav||RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on Tuesday alleged that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is the richest party in the country as well as in the world and “it only cares for rich people and not the poor”. “BJP is not just the richest party in the country but also in the world. They only care for rich people and not the poor. The migrant labourers and weaker sections are dying but they (BJP) worry about their family and rich people. They will reach out to common people during elections to seek votes,” Yadav told ANI on being asked about BJP taking out rallies on the completion of one year of Narendra Modi’s second tenure as Prime Minister. He further stressed that migrant workers condition is appalling and the government should have taken adequate measures for their safety before implementing the Covid-19 lockdown. The RJD leader also attacked the Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over poor condition of workers in the state as well as lack of facilities at the quarantine centres.“Quarantine centres in Bihar are not maintained well. The government has failed to make proper arrangements for the people under quarantine. If the government is failing to discharge its duty in a well-planned manner, then they can seek help from the opposition parties,” he said.Yadav also maintained that it is the moral duty of opposition parties to step forward to help all those in need amid Covid-19 crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bjp-richest-party-in-world-doesn-t-care-for-poor-tejashwi-yadav/story-GpF1nRjqdkBvPVMhkOohSI.html
26-05-2020||Lucknow||Yogi for expediting setting up of migration commission||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has said that measures to set up the migration commission should be expedited to provide jobs to migrant workers, on Monday, amid controversy surrounding his move following Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray’s objections.Yogi gave the directives on Monday at a meeting of his Team-11 convened to review the lockdown situation here.“Yes, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has asked for making efforts on a war footing to set up the migration commission. The commission will be set up in the next few days in accordance with the existing provisions of law,” said chief secretary RK Tiwari.At a webinar on Sunday, chief minister said his government would set up the commission in the interest of workers and if any other state wanted to use Uttar Pradesh’s manpower they would need to take the state government’s permission. “The migration commission will work in the interest of the migrant workers. If any other state wants UP’s manpower, they cannot take them away just like that. Those states will have to do it with the consent and permission of the UP government. The way our migrant workers were ill-treated in those states, the UP government will take their insurance, social security in its hands now. The UP government will stand with them wherever they work, whether in Uttar Pradesh, other states or other countries,” he said.Asked if the state government would study the Centre’s Inter State Migrant Workmen Act or go for enacting a new law to set up the commission, Tiwari said, “Our basic objective is to watch the welfare of migrant labourers and ensure that they get their wages.”The state government’s move about its prior permission for jobs in other states may, however, have to stand legal scrutiny with experts saying there can’t be any restriction on doing business in any part of the country. “The Constitution of India provides a fundamental right allowing every citizen free movement and the right to do business anywhere in India. The state government can enact any law for welfare of migrant labourers. It however cannot restrict these rights,” said former advisor to governor and legal expert CB Pandey.About 25 lakh migrant labourers have already reached the state. The state government is carrying out an exercise for skill mapping of the migrant labourers. An official spokesman said the skill mapping so far has indicated the largest number of 1,51,492 migrant workers have come from the real estate development sector. Yogi said the skill mapping exercise should continue and the district employment exchanges should be made useful, and help migrant labourers get a job.Earlier, reacting strongly to Yogi’s announcement, MNS chief Raj Thackeray, in a post on Twitter, on Monday, said, “The CM of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath has stated that if the services of workers of UP are required, then prior permission of the UP government is essential. If such is the case, then any migrant entering Maharashtra too, would need to take permissions from us, from the Maharashtra state, our police force. Shri Adityanath needs to take cognizance of this.”Thackeray further said, “Also, the Maharashtra government needs to look into this matter seriously. In future, whenever migrants do enter our state, they will need to be registered and their personal details and their identification proof will need to be submitted to the police station. Only if these requirements are met with diligently, will they be allowed to enter Maharashtra. A strict adherence to the above needs to be followed by Maharashtra.”In another tweet Thackeray said, “Also, the migrant workers from UP will have voting rights only in UP. As per rules laid down, a voter can only vote from one place and cannot exercise their voting rights in two places. This fact needs to be realised by CM Adityanath, by Maharashtra and other states too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/yogi-for-expediting-setting-up-of-migration-commission/story-dHZunMvZlXqPacChWHKafK.html
26-05-2020||Lucknow||Agra’s 36 hotspots pose hurdles on road to normality||They are here, there and everywhere, both physically and psychologically. Thirty-six heavily barricaded hotspots in Agra district are a daily reminder to people here that the Taj city is far from being on the road to normality.The district has reported the maximum of 851 Covid-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh and a death toll of 31.Agra’s tryst with the coronavirus began on March 2 when five positive cases were reported. The area where the affected family resided — Master Plan Road — was isolated from the remaining city.As the number of infected patients grew, more hotspot areas were marked.“Besides being a hurdle in movement on the road, these containment zones are almost like a psychological barrier. Till they continue to exist, one cannot expect normality,” says Dr Madhurima Sharma, head of the department of Hindi at St John’s College here.“Even if movement is allowed within the city with opening of markets, these containment zones will certainly keep one away,” Sharma says.“I recently went out to buy medicine. When I realised that I was quite close to a hotspot area, I dropped the idea and went to another locality for purchasing the medicine,” adds Dr Sharma.“With so many hotspots, no one can expect normality in our city. The value of ‘jaan’ (life) is deemed higher than ‘jahan’ (worldly affairs),” says Rajeev Gupta, former president of the National Chamber for Industries and Commerce.“With so many hotspot areas in the city, only shops for essential items would be approached. Thus, normality seem to be a far-fetched idea for Agra,” adds Gupta.“Anybody moving in the city for some distance comes across such containment zones where the roads are blocked. A suitable ambience for trade seems to be a distant dream with so many hotspots in the city,” says TN Agarwal, president of the Agra Vyapar Mandal.The footwear industry in Agra mostly has local workers who live in the hotspot areas, where the smaller units are located.The Taj Mahal, an attraction for tourists the world over, is in Tajganj, a major hotspot which has 64 Covid-19 cases.Some other hotspots have industrial units and commercial centres.HOW A HOTSPOT IS DECLARED Agra’s chief medical officer Dr RC Pandey says once a coronavirus case is found in a locality, the area is termed as a containment zone or hotspot.“Earlier, it used to be within a radius of one kilometre from the place where a Covid-19 case was found, but now we have reduced the area to 400 metres,” he says.“We apply certain restrictions and speed up sanitization in this area. The stress is on social distancing and movement within the containment zone is restricted to the best possible extent,” he adds.“After 21 days from the last Covid-19 case being reported, the area is removed from the list of hotspots,” Pandey says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/agra-s-36-hotspots-pose-hurdles-on-road-to-normality/story-eLcvNFGwJbcBHB6AciwmVP.html

26-05-2020||Chandigarh||India hockey player Jasjit Kular feeding hundreds of stray dogs in Jalandhar||Every morning since March 25, a couple of days after the statewide curfew was clamped in Punjab, international hockey player Jasjit Singh Kular, who hails from Sansarpur village in Jalandhar, has started his day at 5am.It’s not to train, but to cook chicken soup and prepare a mix of soaked soya chunks and store-bought dog food to feed a large number of stray dogs on a stretch along the Grand Trunk road, 500 metres from his house. Under normal circumstances, these strays would find food from the leftovers at restaurants and highway dhabas, but the lockdown doomed them to stay hungry. Kular, who has three dogs of his own, knew about the Jalandhar-based Animal Protection Foundation that rescues stray dogs. When the lockdown was enforced, he got in touch with them to feed the strays.“Our foundation mainly focuses on treating animals. But we also started feeding stray dogs during the lockdown. While residents feed the animals in residential pockets, we focused on those near highways and commercial areas,” says Shrist Bakshi, 32, who started the foundation three years ago. Kular roped in five friends — an athlete, a musician, a photographer, an IT professional and a librarian — and joined the foundation’s efforts. Together, they feed around 500 dogs on 25-km road stretches in the city. In all, the foundation feeds a 1,000 strays with the help of 16 volunteers, including Kular and his friends.“Ten days ago, I started posting pictures on my Facebook account. This drew the attention of many people I know, and now they are also contributing,” says Kular, who made his India debut at the 2014 World Cup in the Netherlands.“It takes us around four hours in the morning (to complete the rounds). The six of us split up into three groups and daily cover around 25-30 km of road stretch,” says the 30-year-old.“We buy bags of soya chunks and dog food from the market. Our daily requirement is around 30kg. We prepare soup using 1kg chicken, but don't give the bones to the dogs as this causes fights between them. We also need around 150 chapattis and some packets of bread, which are provided by some households in my neighbourhood. We use disposable bowls for feeding the dogs,” says Kular .The foundation tied up with a local pet shop for the packaged dog food, which maintained its supply through the lockdown. “We put the dog food in a lot of water before starting our feeding routine, so that they can get water with the meals,” says Kular.  Having played 65 international matches, Kular last took the field for India during the 2018 World Hockey League. He now plays for Indian Railways in national championships. Sansarpur, the cradle of Indian hockey, has produced 14 Olympians, who have collectively won 15 Olympic medals. Five of them have also represented Kenya and Canada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/india-hockey-player-jasjit-kular-feeding-hundreds-of-stray-dogs-in-jalandhar/story-Cg2cnQ0Qu92QJjuIWYRBaP.html
26-05-2020||Chandigarh||Balbir Singh Senior: A legend beyond borders||Balbir Singh Senior --- India’s iconic goal machine --- was a legend across the border too, inspiring a generation of hockey players in Pakistan.His stellar on-field skills and down-to earth-demeanour earned him the love and respect of even his rivals. “He was a great player and a greater human being. Even in Pakistan, he is considered a legend. As we both had Punjabi roots, we shared a special bond. So, whenever we met, we always used to converse in Punjabi,” recalls Pakistan’s triple Olympic medallist Motiullah Khan, who played against Balbir Singh in the 1956 Olympics, while taking to HT over phone.Motiullah, 83, who is settled in Bahawalpur in Punjab province, won two silver and gold for the Pakistan in the Olympics. Also read: Balbir Singh Senior, a man who never let India downTill Partition, Motiullah used to play football and it was only in 1949, he started wielding the hockey stick. “My first meeting with Balbir Senior was during the 1955 Bombay Gold Cup. I was playing for Afgan Hockey Club and we lost to Balbir’s side in the semi-final by 1-0. It was Balbir who snatched the win from us,” says Motiullah, who took help of his son Muteeb Ullah Khan to communicate, as he is having hearing issues.“Our next meeting was at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. We lost the final to India 1-0. I still remember the game…Balbir and Leslie Claudius were superb and we all hold them in high regard,” adds Motiullah, who was part of the 1960 Olympics squad when Pakistan won its maiden gold.“A week ago, I came across news that Balbir Senior had been admitted to a hospital. I told my son to enquire about him and he posted couple of message on his Facebook page, but somehow I couldn’t get in touch with his family. His demise is a great loss to the hockey world,” he says. Another triple Olympic medallist from Pakistan, Abdul Rasheed Junior, reminisces: “My elder brother Abdul Hameed ‘Hameedi’ had played with him during the 1948, ’52 and ’56 Olympics. I got a chance to interact with the legend when he was the manager of the Indian team in the 1971 World Cup. He was a thorough gentleman and the players from both sides have so much to learn from him.”Batting for India-Pak hockey seriesMotiullah says sports and cultural exchanges should not be kept hostage to political relations. Strongly batting for India-Pakistan bilateral hockey series, he says sports can bring both the nations together. “It is sad that because of political differences, such a series seems to be distant dream in the near future.

26-05-2020||City||Balachaur granthi’s death murder, not mishap, say SBS Nagar police||Two months after a granthi, Jasbir Singh, was found lying dead on the Balachaur-Rahon road with his scooter by his side, police have added murder charges to the First-Information Report (FIR), instead of treating it as an accident case. The police move comes after two of six accused in the murder case of former scribe, Sanpreet Mangat, of Rahon on May 10, confessed to killing the granthi with robbery as motive. SBS Nagar Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) in-charge inspector Dalbir Singh Sidhu had conducted the interrogation. The post-mortem report also points to the fact that the granthi was murdered. Initially, the police were treating Mangat’s death as accident too and registered a case under these sections at the Rahon police station. Murder charges were added and the accused arrested, following the post-mortem report that did not back police theory, and senior officers’ intervention. Sources said it was a major lapse on the part of the police to treat two murders as accidents first and to add these sections to the FIRs only later. In their defence, police officials claim that they had always feared something was amiss and thus they got a post-mortem conducted from a medical board.A police official claimed, on condition of anonymity, “In the granthi’s case that was reported on March 21, the investigation was delayed due to the imposition of the lockdown.” In both the deaths, the initial case was registered under Sections 279 (rash or negligent driving on a public way) and 304-A (death due to negligence) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/balachaur-granthi-s-death-murder-not-mishap-say-sbs-nagar-police/story-3eohOoUke3W9G3hD1SjMRI.html
26-05-2020||City||Former HP health director sent to jail after discharge from hospital||Former health services director Dr Ajay Gupta, who was arrested on graft charges recently, has been sent to the Kaithu sub-jail here, officials said on Monday.Gupta was arrested on May 20 by the state vigilance and anti-corruption bureau in connection with an audio clip wherein money was being demanded in lieu of some supply of sanitisers. However, due to low blood sugar and hypertension, he was admitted to Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital. He was discharged on Monday and taken to the prison subsequently.Meanwhile, the news of the alleged health department scam has reached the Prime Minister’s office after BJP leaders from the state sent a letter to the PMO in this regard.In the letter, the BJP leaders have defended chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, who currently holds the health portfolio.BJP spokesperson Randheer Sharma on Monday said the state government has a zero-tolerance policy against corruption and that the CM has taken immediate action in every graft case so far.Lashing out at Congress leaders for their recent statements questioning the CM’s intent, Sharma said the latter had ordered a vigilance inquiry as soon as the case of sanitiser supply reached the secretariat and prompt action was taken following the release of the alleged audio clip incriminating Gupta.He said Gupta was arrested and suspended immediately and investigation against him was ongoing. “Congress leaders should wait for the results. Anyone involved in this matter will not be spared by the state government no matter how influential they are,” the BJP spokesperson said.Accusing Congress of politicising the issue, Sharma said the whole state has been battling the Covid-19 pandemic for the last two months, but the opposition is making baseless statements to remain relevant and gain political advantage.BJP strongly condemns this low level politics by the opposition leaders, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/former-hp-health-director-sent-to-jail-after-discharge-from-hospital/story-578AyRUJiHfb6cafuUTcmJ.html

Eid-al-Fitr marks the last day of the month of Shawwal according to the Islamic calendar, which marks the end of the month-long dawn-to-sunset fasting of Ramzan.“The entire world, including our country, has been affected by Covid-19, with thousands of new cases coming up every day. We request you to follow the lockdown, stay indoors and not venture out for shopping,” said Maulana Mehmood Daryabadi, president, Ulema Council.On Monday, as the city celebrated Eid, the Raza Jama Masjid at Phool Gali in south Mumbai, to prevent gathering of devotees inside mosques, arranged for five prayer services online, which devotees accessed through their mobile phones.At other areas of the city, socio-religious and community groups helped needy members with essentials to make sheer kurma, a sweet dish made on Eid. A group of 15 friends from Mumbai Central distributed 1,100 kits, with each of them containing milk, sugar, sevaiyan (vermicelli) and dry fruits, among other things, to the poor at Byculla, Mazagaon, Tardeo and Dharavi.“By now, there are volunteers in the all slum areas, who get in touch with NGOs [non-governmental organisations] and groups, and inform them about the families who are in need of essentials. According to their list, we distributed the kits in these areas,” said Ovesh Heera, a member of the group.Although most members celebrated the festivities indoors, there were reports of lockdown violations in certain parts of Phydhonie and Null Bazaar, where residents alleged that huge crowds had gathered for Eid shopping to purchase clothes, food items and footwear, on Sunday night. The claims were dismissed by senior police officers from the area, who termed it ‘fake news’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/eid-prayer-services-go-online-in-mumbai-amid-covid-outbreak-youths-help-poor-with-essentials/story-5vYBgMclNYIVq6C24NPQBO.html
26-05-2020||City||Chandigarh airport takes wings again||After a gap of more than two months, Chandigarh international airport resumed its operations here on Monday with seven flights arriving and departing with 790 passengers.The operations at the airport were shut on March 24 when a nationwide lockdown was announced by the Prime Minister in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.Even though eight flights were scheduled for Monday, only seven took off as the Air India flight to Dharamsala was cancelled due to operational reasons. In total, 490 passengers arrived and 300 departed during the day.With 142 fliers, the first Indigo flight from Mumbai arrived at the airport at 11.30am and left for Mumbai at 12.10pm with just 38 passengers.The last Air India flight from Delhi arrived with 17 passengers at 8.30pm and departed with 10 at 9pm.Three Indigo, two Air India and one each of AirAsia and Vistara flights were operational on Monday, connecting Chandigarh to Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore.Screening on arrival, departureThe passengers were screened on both arrival and departure. Even the Punjab health team randomly took swab samples of 133 persons who were natives of Punjab. Those who arrived were instructed to observe 14-day home quarantine.On the low turnout of passengers for departure, airport’s chief executive officer (CEO) Ajay Bhardwaj said, “All the passengers stuck in metro cities are coming back to their native places. The situation will improve every day.”Passengers from Mumbai landed at the airport in PPE coveralls, masks, gloves, and carrying sanitisers. The passengers wishing to depart were asked to come three hours before the flight.Deepak Kapoor, an artist working in Mumbai, who landed in Chandigarh, said, “We were screened three times at the Mumbai airport before boarding the plane, and again here at Chandigarh airport upon arrival. I was stuck in Mumbai for two months and I am happy to be back home. I am looking forward to being home-quarantined.”Priya from Bhatinda, who works in the private sector in Mumbai, said, “I was feeling homesick and wanted to come back home. I was missing my parents. At least now, I will be at home.”“The situation in Mumbai was not good and I felt that Himachal Pradesh is doing much better to control the Covid-19 situation. For the last two months, I was with my family in Mumbai. I am relieved to be back home,” said another flier, Mukesh Kumar, a native of Hamirpur in Himachal Pradesh, who arrived here with his family.Only Punjab residents being tested at airportDr Harmandeep Kaur Brar, nodal officer for Covid-19, Mohali, said, “Our teams are permanently stationed at the airport to screen all patients, while samples of only Punjab natives are being taken. After their registration, we are instructing them to undergo 14-day home quarantine. If any passenger shows symptoms, we will take them to the hospital for further testing.”Airport CEO Ajay Bhardwaj said SOPs have been formulated for the safety of the passengers and airport staff, which include social distancing and stringent thermal screening. “Passengers are requested to adhere to all the instructions and carry printed boarding passes,” he added.Residents of Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana will be tested by the concerned district authorities while they observe home-quarantine.BOXNo thermal scanner at airportEven though on March 5 the then officiating deputy commissioner, Aashika Jain, had directed the health department to immediately buy thermal scanners worth ₹15 lakh, no equipment has been made available at the airport yet.Thermal cameras can scan large crowds and spot people with higher temperatures, thereby saving time. Once authorities identify the possibly infected persons, they can segregate them for further screening.In the absence of a thermal scanner, the department is scanning passengers with thermometers, which are proving to be a logistics nightmare.Mohali DC Girish Dayalan said, “There was an issue of funds for buying a thermal scanner, but now we have asked the industry to buy one under corporate social responsibility.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-airport-takes-wings-again/story-B5zn31TsSCrKlMs4vJoCxJ.html
26-05-2020||Mumbai||IISc experts to collect sound samples of Covid patients’ cough, breath||Over the next couple of months, researchers at the Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Science (IISc) will collaborate with hospitals, nodal and district health centres across India to develop a database of sound samples — cough, breath, and voice — from Covid-19 patients as a first-line diagnostic tool.Last week, IISc received an in-principal nod from the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) to collect respiratory sound data by tying up with hospitals treating Covid-19 patients. Researchers said marrying this database, christened Coswara, with machine learning techniques and expertise from doctors treating respiratory illnesses could serve as a pre-screening mobile or web-based tool to help diagnose individuals potentially infected with the Sars-Cov2 virus that causes Covid-19. “Our data will be generated in an Indian context because voice and cough sounds are affected by various local conditions such as weather and pollution. Using data from an external world can therefore be problematic since our population data may not match algorithms developed to build the Covid-19 diagnostic tool. We would like to enrol hospitals and health centres in the five major cities with high infection rates,” said Sriram Ganapathy, assistant professor, department of electrical engineering, IISc, who is spearheading project Coswara. The institute’s work assumes importance with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and America’s Centre for Disease Control (CDC) having listed dry cough, difficulty in breathing, chest pain or pressure, and loss of speech or movement as key symptoms of Covid-19, which start showing between two to 14 days after exposure to the virus. A recent modelling study of data collected from a pool of 7,178 Covid-positive individuals validated the presence of these symptoms, and proposed a real-time prediction and tracking approach. The study was published in internationally peer-reviewed journal, Nature Medicine.At present, nasal or throat swab samples of symptomatic individuals are tested with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method — considered a gold standard for Covid-19 diagnosis — and the results are available between two and 48 hours.“The limitations of the RT-PCR method, however, include violating physical distancing rules that can increase the chances of the spread of the infection in addition to it being time-consuming, expensive and the difficulties involved with large-scale deployment,” said Ganapathy. “There is a need for an alternate point-of-care diagnostic tool that can be widely deployed to supplement existing chemical testing capacities given the pandemic is expected to stay for a while.”The eight-member team has so far remotely collected respiratory sound samples (https://coswara.iisc.ac.in/) from 1,000 participants, including healthy individuals, those with respiratory infections and Covid-19 patients via worldwide crowd sourcing using a website application to establish proof of their concept.The sound data comprises nine categories: Breathing (shallow and deep); cough (shallow and heavy); three kinds of sustained vowel phonation; and counting 1 to 20 (normal and fast-paced). Analysis of data using signal processing and machine learning techniques will be followed by building a mathematical model to develop biomarkers for Covid-19 from sound samples. As a mobile or web-based application, the user can record her/his voice samples for analysis and this will be used to predict whether or not the sample is similar to a Covid-19 infection. Researchers said the final deployment would be subject to validation with clinical findings, and authorisation or approval from ICMR.In addition to IISc, at least three research groups at Carnegie Mellon in the United States of America, Cambridge University in the United Kingdom and École Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland are also working on similar Covid-19 pre-screening diagnostic tools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iisc-experts-to-collect-sound-samples-of-covid-patients-cough-breath/story-tNqZwkX15dnfEgs9fVRPJI.html

Unfortunately, I can’t see myself performing, but I am getting good response from other athletes.”The athlete said, “I am thankful to my coach Sanjeev Sharma, who is providing me daily workout plans and giving training through Whatsapp. As I am visually, my coach explains the right way of doing an exercise to my wife Kiranjeet Kaur and she helps me in performing it correctly.”He added his two sons — Jaskaran Singh, 11, and Ishveer Singh, 7, assist him and also exercise along with him in morning and evening hours.A national record holder in the 100m race, Gurveer was gearing up for the Paralympic Open National Athletic Championship before lockdown as the championship was scheduled to be held at Mysore on March 24 but, later, the championship was postponed due to the spread of coronavirus.Gurveer was to represent Punjab in 100m, 200m and 400m races in this championship. He said the next date of the championship has not been announced yet.Running on tracks for the past 21 years, Gurveer had bagged medals in several national-level competitions. “The national championship was not held in 2019. So, my last achievement was in the Paralympic National Athletic Championship held in March 2018 at Panchkula. In the championship, I had bagged a gold medal in the 400m race and a bronze in the 200m race,” he said, while adding that prior to this, there was another national championship organised by the National Federation of Blind at the Guru Nanak Stadium here in January 2018, in which he had won a gold medal in 100m and 200m races each and a silver medal in the 400m race.‘FRIEND MOTIVATED ME FOR ATHLETICS’Recalling his struggle, the sprinter said, “In 1999, I was studying at the vocational rehabilitation training centre, Haibowal, Ludhiana, when my friend Vivek Monga, who is also a visually impaired athlete, motivated me to take part in athletics. Once he tied my arm with his with a rope and started training me for an event that was to be held at Jalandhar in 1999. It was my first sports event, and I participated in the 100-metre sprint.”Gurveer’s passion for track events built up and, in 2000, he earned his first medal (bronze) in long jump at a national-level competition organised by the RD Educational and Charitable Trust in Chennai. He had set a national record in the 100m race in 2008 and in 2010, he was also felicitated with a state award.Gurveer, who is also working with the Ludhiana Central Cooperative Bank, is also thankful to his parents Ajit Singh and Baljit Kaur for being his moral support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/34-yr-old-blind-sprinter-s-workout-video-during-lockdown-an-inspiration-for-athletes/story-jG1hJQgKkGyRR8BXZH02OO.html

26-05-2020||City||10 digital X-ray machines to help Mumbai civic body detect virus in patients||Following in the footsteps of China, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has now decided to examine suspected and asymptomatic Covid patients using X-ray machines. Ten digital X-ray machines have been installed at various jumbo centres to help in the early diagnosis of patients, especially asymptomatic ones. Health experts have welcomed the development.Earlier this month, the civic body had installed an X-ray machine at the quarantine facility National Sports Club of India (NSCI) Dome in Worli, where 500 suspected patients are being screened for coronavirus every day. After receiving a positive response, the corporation has now decided to extend the facility at other jumbo quarantine centres such as the NESCO Exhibition Centre in Goregaon and the 1,000-bed facility at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC). Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “World-wide, X-ray and CT scans have helped in identifying patients even without symptoms. If this procedure becomes fruitful, then we will install X-ray machines in Dharavi and other slum areas for screening.”Along with asymptomatic patients, X-ray machines can also help in identifying the presence of the virus in those patients whose swab tests have come negative but are carriers of the virus, said radiologists.The radiology screening of the lungs can also help in distinguishing the Sars-Cov-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19 and affects the lungs of patients – from other respiratory ailments.“As we can’t run swab tests on asymptomatic patients, this process can help us in identifying more Covid patients,” Dr Hemang Deshmukh, dean of King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Parel, said.Infectious diseases expert Dr Vikrant Shah said that China had adopted the policy for its patients. “This technology can also help in controlling the false positive reporting of cases. BMC should have taken the step earlier. Other than swab tests, a physician can identify a Covid patient through X-rays and oxygen saturation level. So, this diagnosis system will course help in identifying patients earlier,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10-digital-x-ray-machines-to-help-mumbai-civic-body-detect-virus-in-patients/story-BbsfJPStZqn1trasZZDIbO.html
26-05-2020||City||Spike in deaths, cases with unknown history, major causes of concern for J&K govt||The Jammu and Kashmir government on Monday said that spike in deaths and cases with unknown history were the major causes of concern for it and therefore strict police is being enforced for red zones and containment areas.Addressing media here Monday evening, Principal Secretary Rohit Kansal, however, informed that with the testing rate of over 10,000 per million Jammu and Kashmir has now become number one in the country in testing.“The testing capacity in the UT has gone up from just about 100 tests a day in March to 8000 tests a day today. In the last one month alone it has gone up from 1800 tests a day to 8100 a day – an increase of 350 percent,” he said.He said that aggressive and sustained testing is the only effective weapon against the disease and the administration shall continue to pursue it effectively.On the efforts to of the administration in combating the situation arising out of Corona Virus and the COVID 19 pandemic for the last more than 8 weeks, Kansal said that the Government has taken a slew of measures on the health, economic and welfare fronts. “Jammu and Kashmir was probably one of the first states or UTs to take note of the emerging situation and initiate action and many of our interventions have not only been been fast but effective too.It may be recalled that the total number of COVID 19 cases in J&K is 1668, out of which 1374 are from Kashmir division and 294 are from Jammu division. The number of active cases is 836 of which 620 are in Kashmir Division and 216 are in Jammu division. As many as 809 recoveries which include young children and 23 unfortunate deaths have also been reported. A total of over 1.34 lakh persons have been enlisted for surveillance out of which over 72,000 have completed mandatory period of surveillance. 47 new Covid positive cases have been reported today, out of which 33 cases are from Jammu division and 14 cases are from Kashmir. As per the media bulletin of the health department, no recovery has been reported today.Kansal pointed out that while J&K had been able to achieve a low growth rate and a doubling rate of over 3 weeks, this should not become a cause of complacency. Reminding that effective lockdown, strong containment policy, aggressive testing and cooperation by the people of J&K has played a key role in containment of COVID 19, the spokesperson said that there is no room for any laxity. “What we now need is to understand that there are enough worrying factors in the situation. 15 deaths have been reported in last month alone. There is at least one district which has more than 200 active cases and at least one district with more than 150 active cases. There are at least 2 districts where the number of active cases per million are higher than 150. At least half of the districts have a doubling rate less than 14 days. At least 2 districts have seen a considerable increase in cases even when there are no returnees. In fact, there are many areas where the positivity rate of cases is much higher for local population than for returnees.” he said and added that a number of local, indigenous cases for which contact chains are not yet fully clear have also been reported which is a cause of concern.He said that over 90,000 stranded persons have already returned to J&K in the last 4 weeks alone, they include 66024 persons by road, 25400 by 30 Shramik special and COVID special Rajdhani trains and 652 persons by air. “J&K is the one state/UT which has smoothly completed more than 85% of its evacuation process. The government has consciously adopted a policy of testing 100% of all returnees. All the returnees are being tested, and as a result of the strategy the administration has been successful in tracing 481 positive cases so far.” By testing people at the entry point we are ensuring that positive cases are traced and isolated at the entry point itself, thereby avoiding any infections getting into the community”, he added.Emphasizing on the importance of economy and livelihoods, Kansal said that UT Government has issued SoPs for the reopening of markets, industry and trade. Similarly SOPs have been issued for returnees and passengers. “But as responsible citizens we need to realize that any complacency or letting down of the guard can cost us very dearly. In red zones and containment zones, there is a need to be vigilant otherwise all the efforts of the last 2 months will be wasted,” he cautioned.The spokesperson appealed people to stay at home and go out of their homes only if it is absolutely necessary and follow the advisories, wear a mask, and practice social distancing. “Remember, the virus is alive, it is active and it has given no relaxation. So, our self restraint and discipline must continue, he warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/spike-in-deaths-cases-with-unknown-history-major-causes-of-concern-for-j-k-govt/story-9L1xogtgHSd8jpE6h66iqM.html

26-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s Sectors 38, 52 on the road to lose containment zone tag||Even as the UT administration struggles to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Bapu Dham Colony, two of the six containment zones in the city – Sectors 38 and 52 – are on their way to shake off the tag.The six containment zones in the city are Kacchi Colony in Dhanas, parts of Sector 30B, Bapu Dham Colony in Sector 26, Sector- 38 EWS Colony, Sector 52 and Shastri Nagar in Manimajra. Significantly, while Bapu Dham Colony has become the epicentre of the pandemic in Chandigarh with 73% (202) of city’s total cases (275), the spread of disease in other five zones has been largely restricted, with only 33 cases (12%).The last positive Covid-19 case in Sector 38 was on April 29, and no new case has been reported in Sector 52 since April 30. At Shastri Nagar, Manimajra, the last positive case was on May 2, Kacchi Colony on May 5 and at Sector 30B, on May 7.As per the central government’s guidelines, a containment zone can be denotified only if no new case of Covid-19 is reported in the locality for 28 days since the last case tested negative.Sector 38 completes the 28-day period on May 26, and Sector 52 on May 27. For the other three areas, the expected timeline for denotification is May 30 for Shastri Nagar, June 4 for Sector 30B and June 8 for Kacchi Colony.“A final call on declaring these areas as non-containment zones will be taken soon after health authorities are consulted,” deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar said.There is no active case in four of the six zones – Sector 38, Sector 52, Shastri Nagar and Kacchi Colony, and these areas have so far reported only 11 cases in all against the 438 people tested there. While Bapu Dham Colony has 82 active cases, there is only one active case in Sector 30B.Of all the people tested in Chandigarh, only 36% are from the six containment zones, even though these areas account for 85% (235) of the total cases in the city.In the city’s first containment zone — a part of Sector 30B — which has nearly 590 households, only 113 people have been tested, of which 22 were found infected with coronavirus. This accounts for a 19.4% positivity rate, 2.9% less than Bapu Dham Colony where 202 of 905 (22.3%) people tested were found positive.Though the first case, that of a health worker, was reported in Bapu Dham Colony on April 24, which was followed by a consistent rise in cases, it was only on May 22 that the UT health department scaled up testing, and decided to test all residents living in the same building as the positive persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-sectors-38-52-on-the-road-to-lose-containment-zone-tag/story-orKstKDVuJKemS0CLtzKEP.html

Sandhu and senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra had visited Chaura Bazaar on Monday to participate in a Covid-19 awareness drive. They distributed masks among visitors and shopkeepers. They also apprised the traders of the importance of maintaining hygiene. State general secretary of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, Sunil Mehra, said, “An old drain which starts from Talab Bazaar and merges with Buddha Nullah moving through different parts of the old city, has been choked for years. Due to this, rainwater accumulates in most of the old city areas and shopkeepers suffer losses.”“We urged the municipal corporation (MC) to expedite the work of cleaning the sewer lines in the city so that residents do not suffer during monsoon,” he added.Mayor Balkar Sandhu said he directed the MC staff to speed up the work of cleaning the sewer lines. “The officials have also been directed to clean the Buddha Nullah ahead of monsoon so that the internal drains, which discharge waste in the Nullah, do not choke during monsoon,” said mayor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ahead-of-monsoon-chaura-bazaar-retailers-seek-respite-from-water-logging-woes/story-3q8MwWnQEMwJaSLrLGGlGP.html

26-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Covid-19 death toll crosses 1,000; 2,436 fresh cases in Maharashtra||Maharashtra on Monday recorded 2,436 new Covid-19 cases, taking its tally to 52,667. The state witnessed 60 fatalities, pushing up the toll to 1,695. With 38 of these recorded in Mumbai, the city crossed the 1,000 death-mark. While Mumbai’s Covid-19 toll rose to 1,026, the number of cases in Mumbai increased by 1,430 to 31,972. In other parts of the state, Pune recorded 244 fresh cases, while Thane 149 new cases on Monday, taking their virus count up to 5,319 and 2,739 respectively.Maharashtra, which is the worst-hit state in the country, has witnessed a surge in Covid-19 cases, with more than 20,000 infections reported over the past nine days alone. The state government is expecting cases to rise further in the next fortnight, especially in Mumbai and Pune, said state health department officials, adding that the government has already started strengthening its health infrastructure and adding new beds. Mumbai, which accounts for 60% of Maharashtra’s coronavirus cases, has been staring at a shortage of hospital beds and intensive care unit (ICU) facilities.The Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) on Monday outlined the plan to increase beds in Mumbai by creating “jumbo facilities”. The CMO said a centralised dashboard has been created to track the availability of beds and its location in real-time. With increased capacity and real-time tracking of beds, patients will not have to spend crucial hours waiting for availability of beds.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his address to the state on Sunday, said the government is anticipating a spike in cases by month-end. As a part of their preparations for the surge in Mumbai, a field hospital at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) with 1,000 beds, including 200 ICU beds, has been readied in a fortnight. Additionally, a Covid Care Centre (CCC) with 600 beds at Mahalaxmi Racecourse, which will have 125 ICU beds, is being erected for patients with mild infections. Nesco Exhibition Centre in Goregaon will have 535 beds.“In the next two weeks, Dedicated Covid Hospital Centre (DCHC) and Dedicated Covid Hospital (DCH) collectively with 7,000 beds will come up at Dahisar, Mulund, Mahalaxmi Racecourse, and Goregaon,” a note from the CMO said. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is acquiring hospitals with 100 beds and 20 ICUs in each ward to tackle the rise in cases. Similarly, hospitals are being acquired in Thane city. Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde has asked to augment bed capacity at the Thane district hospital too. As many as 150 beds will be added at the hospital.Meanwhile, according to the state health department, of the 60 deaths recorded on Monday, 54 were in the past 48 hours, while the remaining six are from last week. The fatalities are of 42 men and 18 women. Twenty-seven of those who succumbed to the infection were over 60 years, while 29 were in the 40 to 59 age group, and three were under 40 years. According to the health department, 78%, or 47 patients, had high-risk co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-covid-19-death-toll-crosses-1-000-2-436-fresh-cases-in-maharashtra/story-qB6eR0myciCIliNMDa7diN.html
26-05-2020||Mumbai||47 flights operate to and from Mumbai amid cancellations, chaos over rules||After almost two months, commercial flight operations began in Mumbai on Monday morning, with the departure and arrival of 47 flights at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA). The first flight left for Patna at 6.45am, while a flight from Lucknow was the first arrival at 8.20am. Both the flights were operated by IndiGo. Mumbai airport, which used to handle 950 flights daily, has been shut from March 25, except for evacuation and Covid-related cargo operations. Of the 47 flights, eleven flights were operated to and from Delhi. The rest were either to/from or both to Kochi, Hyderabad, Varanasi, Bangalore, Patna, Calicut, Diu, Lucknow, Nagpur, Chandigarh, Gorakhpur, Allahabad and Jaipur. A total of 4,852 passengers (3,752 departing passengers and 1,100 arriving passengers) were flown to and from the airport on Monday. The highest passenger load was seen on the departure to Delhi route. Senior airport officials said the airport also handled a few non-scheduled flights, Vande Bharat and cargo flights, taking the total number of flights operated to 84. However, there was confusion owing to last-minute changes in flight schedules, as a result of differences between the Centre and state governments. The restrictions on the number of flights placed by some states also led to cancellation of scheduled services.Sudhanshu Pandey, who was on an official trip to Mumbai and was stuck for two months, booked a seat on an 8am flight to Delhi. “It was only at 6.30am when I entered the check-in area that I learnt that the flight was cancelled. I had booked three cabs in advance so I don’t face issues while travelling to the airport. This is the second time that my air ticket money is blocked.” Sources confirmed that the airport will run 44 flights on Tuesday and 50 on Wednesday.Jammu resident Prashant Sharma, who has been stuck in Mumbai after an event in March, said, “I want to leave Mumbai as I am facing issues with my accommodation. Although I am currently staying at a friend’s home, the housing society members had made it clear to me that I won’t be given entry on the society premises if the flight is cancelled. I have not received payment for the event and have lost ₹12,000 only in booking my tickets.”Flier Devendra Nath Tripathi tweeted, ‘We are at the Mumbai Airport for AI-809 and have no confirmation for the flight. Air India online status shows flight on time.. ground reality is grim.. no cabs to return.. no water despite boarding pass. Terrible management by #AirIndia.”Ashwini Pandey, a banker and a resident of Chennai, had purchased tickets of four airlines to reach Mumbai, but all the four flights were cancelled. “I have to join work urgently on June 10. Only if I reach Mumbai now, can I join my new office after finishing my quarantine period. Two flights got cancelled today and two flights that were scheduled on Tuesday too have been cancelled”Rishi Goel, a Shimla resident who works in Mumbai, said he wanted to return as his wife delivered during the lockdown. Goel could board his Chandigarh-bound flight, but termed the experience troublesome. He said, “My airline first messaged me that my flight was cancelled and then sent an updated message that my flight was on time. Their website however continued to show my flight to be cancelled. It was only at 3am that the airline website was updated with my flight status and I could take off at 9am.”It was however a happy day for Mohammad Ansari who could reach Allahabad to celebrate Eid. “I had enquired about my flight status a day before departure. As the flight was on time, I reached the airport and took off on time.”“Resumption of flights from May 25 has caused a lot of chaos. The problem for passengers began with individual states rolling out their guidelines relating to the operations of airports and post-travel quarantine rules. Only a fraction of flights from some of the busiest airports resulted in a spike in cancellations with a majority of travellers uncertain,” said Nishant Pitti, co- founder, easemytrip.com“All arriving passengers will be stamped on their left hand for identification and will have to undergo compulsory home isolation for seven days as per the protocol by the municipal corporation. Passengers who are coming in for a short duration and have planned a return or onward journey will have to share the details and will be exempted from isolation. Furthermore, the airport has created temporary isolation centres in case any passenger shows symptoms of the virus during the screening,” said an MIAL spokesperson.Maharashtra government issues guidelines 14-day self-isolation is mandatory on arrival in the state. Domestic travellers arriving in Mumbai will have to isolate themselves at home after being stamped at the airport, while those leaving the state in seven days have been exempted from isolation, but can’t enter containment zones. Travellers will have to submit a self-declaration at the airport on arrival, stating that he/she will not be staying in containment zone and was not under quarantine. He/she will also have to declare that he/she has no fever and will be liable for penal action for travelling without meeting the eligibility criteria. Passengers moving outside red zones to take domestic flights will have to take prior permission which will be given for specific reasons only. For international travellers arriving in the state, the first seven-day quarantine will be at a hotel with the expenses to be borne by the passenger. The next 7-day isolation will be at his/her home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/47-flights-operate-to-and-from-mumbai-amid-cancellations-chaos-over-rules/story-mme9Ewog8Rir18rE7G8XOI.html

PGIMER psychiatrists to study impact of Covid-19 on mental health||What’s the first reaction of a patient who is told that he or she has contracted Covid-19? How tough can quarantining be? To answer these questions, psychiatrists at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research are planning to study the impact of the disease on the mental health of patients, it has been learnt.“We are planning to interact with all the patients recovering from Covid-19 and find out how it has impacted their mental health. We will be reaching out to them,” said Dr Sandeep Grover, of the hospital’s psychiatry department.“It does take a toll on you mentally. For me, the time in isolation was very traumatising,” says a patient who has recovered and does not wish to be named.Apart from the physical suffering, the social stigma attached causes more stress, says another patient who has been cured. “I cannot go for evening walks because my neighbours look at me in a certain way.”On the adverse impact of Covid-19, the World Health Organisation (WHO) mentions that “In public mental health terms, the main psychological impact (of Covid-19) to date is elevated rates of stress or anxiety. But as new measures and impacts are introduced – especially quarantine and its effects on many people’s usual activities, routines or livelihoods – levels of loneliness, depression, harmful alcohol and drug use, and self-harm or suicidal behaviour are also expected to rise.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/depressed-when-isolated-pgimer-psychiatrists-to-study-impact-of-covid-19-on-mental-health/story-XUbPFgFRl6JnhQCyRN3t7K.html

26-05-2020||City||Helpline calls: Intense anxiety grips cops, residents||The helpline, started by police to provide psychological help to police personnel in view of stretched duty hours due to the coronavirus outbreak, has been receiving peculiar queries.According to officers, not only the police personnel, but common people are also calling on the helpline numbers.Some of the callers said they are always under the fear of having developed coronavirus-like symptoms. Some are seeking advice stating they have even developed the fear of meeting people.Dr Nidhi Aggarwal, assistant professor at the Christian Medical College and Hospital, said she received a call from a woman, who said that her three-year-old daughter has been disturbed due to the fear of Covid-19.“The caller said that her daughter asked her repeatedly what will happen to her both parents die of coronavirus. The woman said they used to watch news most of the time on TV and her daughter has developed a fear,” said Dr Aggarwal.“I have advised the woman not to watch TV all the time, as she and her daughter are overloaded with negative information. A three-year-old child does not need to know about coronavirus and its effects. Watching negative all the time could bring negative thoughts in the mind,” she added.Dr Aggarwal said, “Police personnel ask her what chances are there of getting infected with Covid-19 as they are exposed to the public during duty hours. Some are more concerned about the health of their family members.”The residents, who are forced to stay home due to lockdown, have different problems. They said that they have developed the fear of getting infected if they go outside.Dr Aggarwal said due to lockdown, family members have developed deep bonds and they have come closer to each other, but some of them have different issues. They said they are living in small houses and are not finding personal space. They feel suffocated as they are not able to chat or call their friends as family members are around all the time.Deputy commissioner of police (DCP, headquarters) Akhil Chaudhary said the department had launched the helpline on May 11 to provide psychological help to police personnel over phone from 4pm to 6pm. They are receiving at least 20 calls daily from the police personnel for help.Chaudhary said, “The police personnel are working for more than 12 to 15 hours daily. Besides investigating cases, they are maintaining law and order in the city. They are also distributing food and ration among the needy and helping the health department in taking corona patients to hospitals. They are engaged in streamlining the process of sending migrant labourers to their native places also. Stretched duty hours due to coronavirus outbreak and stress of extended working hours due to curfew are taking a toll on their mental and physical health.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/helpline-calls-fear-psychosis-grips-police-personnel-residents/story-4840D2g6f3DCUVTXFeucCO.html

Also, it will take some time to revive. Hence, we have urged the government to extend the deadlines.”Kular said, “Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has provided relief to real estate sector with a six-month extension in the permissible period of construction. But no relief has been provided to industry.”“If any industrialist fails to complete construction within the deadline, 10% no construction charges are imposed by the government and the allotment is cancelled on non-payment of charges,” said Kular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-industry-body-seeks-1-5-year-relief-to-end-under-construction-projects/story-5vekYqjmUttKatEBtafx6K.html

26-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police nab man who escaped custody, travelled 1,100km to Capital||Delhi Police have arrested a 33-year-old man for allegedly escaping from police custody in Nagpur and then hitch-hiking his way across the country -- all to meet his wife.Police said the escaped prisoner, Ceejo Chandaran, had not met his wife since he left Delhi in 2012.Chandaran was in under custody for cases of kidnapping for ransom, attempt to murder, robbery and under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act.Nine days ago, he escaped from Maharashtra Police’s custody while being taken to a hospital in Nagpur and travelled 1,110 km to the Capital. Delhi Police caught him at the house of his in-laws in south Delhi’s Dakshinpuri.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said that in October 2018, Chandaran, along with his four associates, kidnapped a Nagpur-based builder’s son and demanded ~1 crore for his safe release.“The local police, however, arrested the kidnappers and safely rescued the boy. They also charged them under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). On May 16, Chandaran escaped from the police custody while being taken to a hospital in Nagpur for treatment,” said DCP Thakur.He travelled to Delhi to meet his wife, Thakur added. Also read: Self-styled godman booked for organising congregation at Delhi templeThe DCP said that the Neb Sarai police learnt about the presence of the escaped prisoner at his in-laws home and caught him. During the interrogation, Thakur said, Chandaran disclosed that he originally belonged to Kerala but shifted to Delhi with his family in the late 80s. In 2012, he went to Nagpur for work and met a woman. “He attempted to kill the woman over some issue. She survived and Chandaran was arrested. In jail, Chandaran came closer to some criminals. After coming out of the jail, they committed some crimes in Nagpur, Andhra Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh,” the DCP said, adding that Nagpur police was informed about Chandaran’s arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-nab-man-who-escaped-custody-travelled-1-100km-to-capital/story-89YtnqU0ITSOGpuCzbf9qK.html
26-05-2020||City||Ludhiana MC to deploy poclain excavators for cleaning Buddha Nullah||With silt accumulating in the Buddha Nullah, the municipal corporation (MC) has finally decided to deploy poclain excavators for desilting it before the onset of monsoon.The process is expected to commence from Tuesday with a deadline to clean the nullah by June 10. Keeping aside the estimate of the irrigation department of Rs 90 lakh for taking up the process, mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu has directed the MC officials to hire a private company for the job. As per information, two machines will be deployed at different points of the nullah at a cost of Rs 4.1 lakh per month. The MC would also bear the cost of fuel. The nullah is the main drain in the city and desilting is necessary as silt accumulated in the nullah reduces its capacity to carry the sewer waste and rainwater. In the past, the MC used to commence desilting in the beginning of April. But, this year, the fund-starved MC, rather than transferring lakhs to the irrigation department, has decided to take up the process by itself. Until now, JCB machines were deputed at the site but, due to their limited reach, the machines are not able to clean the nullah properly. Due to this, the mayor has asked MC officials to rope in a private player.The mayor said, “The Naamdhari sect had cleaned the nullah a few months ago and the MC has also deputed JCB machines to clear the nullah of the garbage and silt, but it has come to light that poclain machines are necessary at some points due to which I have asked the officials to rope in a private player. It does not make any sense to transfer Rs 90 lakh to the irrigation department to do the job. The nullah would be cleaned before monsoon hits the city so that residents do not face any trouble.” MC TO RECRUIT EXPERTS FOR RUNNING STPsWith MC officials not being able to oversee the working of three sewer treatment plants (STPs) in the city, Sandhu has decided to depute private experts at the plants on contractual basis. Sandhu said MC officials have to look into the complaints of the entire city due to which they are not able to oversee the working of the STPs, which are being run by private contractors. The MC officials said, “Around Rs 1.25 crore is spent for running the STPs every month and the mayor wants to reduce the cost of operations. Due to this, the mayor has decided to rope in the retired officials, who are experts in looking after the functioning of the STPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-to-deploy-poclain-excavators-for-cleaning-buddha-nullah/story-4gMbqSV31EclItVKAe0HKL.html
26-05-2020||City||Eid: No big congregations at mosques, residents offer prayers at home||With no big congregations, coronavirus pandemic put a dampener on Eid ul-Fitr celebrations in the city on Monday.“Thousands of Muslims coming from different parts of the state used to offer prayers in and outside Jama Masjid, situated in Field Ganj here. It is for the first time in the past four decades that prayers were offered by just two dozen people in the mosque, but it is for the betterment of the mankind,” said Shahi Imaam Maulana Habib-ur Rehman Sani Ludhianvi. Most residents offered prayers at their homes with their loved ones, he added. Shahi Imaam said, “Celebrations were held by maintaining social distancing and exchanging bouquets in place of customary embrace. There are 72 mosques in the city, but big congregations were not organised at any place and residents offered prayers keeping social distancing in mind. The residents were urged to take care of the needy rather than purchasing spending money on new clothes for Eid.” A resident of the Subhani building area in the old city, Mohammad Shamim, said, “It was an unusual celebration on Monday as no big congregation was witnessed in any mosque in the city, especially at Jama Masjid. Only a limited number of residents were allowed to enter the mosques, but it was necessary keeping in view the Covid-19 threat. Earlier, a large number of residents used to offer prayers even on Field Ganj and Shahpur roads due to shortage of space inside Jama Masjid.” “Most people avoided shopping for new clothes and preferred to help the needy by arranging food for them,” said Shamim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/eid-no-big-congregations-at-mosques-residents-offer-prayers-at-home/story-SD9kHpUFmw3RMVAiGxa8VO.html

26-05-2020||Mumbai||Centre-Maha tussle on special trains rages||The tussle between the Centre led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Maharashtra government led by the Shiv Sena over the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic flared up on Sunday and Monday.Hours after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said the railway ministry is providing half the amount of trains required to ferry labourers back to their home states, Union railway minister Piyush Goyal tweeted back saying they were ready to send 125 trains, provided they do not run “empty” and also sought a list of passengers.This, in turn, led to a war of words between Goyal and Sena MP Sanjay Raut, with the latter saying the Centre needs to change its mindset about Maharashtra and see it as a state and not an Opposition government.In an address to the state on Sunday, the Maharashtra CM said he had demanded 80 Shramik trains per day to ferry migrants home, but got only around 40. Goyal then on Twitter asked Thackeray to send the list of passengers with their medical certificate, details such as boarding station, etc, in the next one hour. “Sadly, it has been 1.5 hours but Maharashtra Govt. has been unable to give required information about tomorrow’s planned 125 trains to GM of Central Railway. Planning takes time & we do not want train to stand empty at the stations, so it’s impossible to plan without full details.”The war of words continued on Monday with Goyal seeking the list. “Where is the list for 125 trains from Maharashtra? As of 2am, received list of only 46 trains of which 5 are to West Bengal and Odisha which cannot operate due to cyclone Amphan. We are notifying only 41 trains for today despite being prepared for 125!!!,” he tweeted.Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis also said, “A constant attempt is being made to blame the Centre for the state’s failures. The Centre is always willing to help.”Coming to the defence of Thackeray, Raut said that earlier trains have left Maharashtra without passenger list. “Many trains have left Maharashtra from Nagpur and Pune without any list. We have that list. If they come out of the mindset that Maharashtra has an opposition government and think of it as a state, the question of seeking lists won’t arise,” Raut told reporters in Mumbai.On Monday afternoon, Raut tweeted: “Piyush ji, what list was sought for Nagpur-Udhampur train that left on May 14, 20[20]. Please share what efforts have been taken to arrange trains first and then to gather passengers? Now which list are you seeking? Don’t forget that you represent Maharashtra in Rajya Sabha.”He further said, “The Maharashtra government has given a list to the railway ministry. There is only one request to Piyush Goyal ji, the trains should reach the destination. The train going to Gorakhpur should not reach Odisha instead.”Raut was referring to last week’s incident where hundreds of labourers travelling to Uttar Pradesh landed in Rourkela in Odisha. The railways later claimed it was a planned diversion on account of congestion.The Thackeray-led government had sought trains for migrants during the first phase of the lockdown and has consistently claimed the Centre’s delay in starting the trains led to migrants taking to roads to head back to their home states. There have also been claims and counter claims between the state and the Centre indirectly over footing the bill for the train journeys.Thackeray, in his address, made a veiled reference at it. “We are yet to get the money for the trains. It will come, but we are not waiting for it. We have footed the bill, so the migrant labourers can go back home,” said Thackeray.The war of words comes on the heels of the state BJP’s ‘Maharashtra Bachao’ protest against the Thackeray-led government for “failing to tackle the pandemic”. This had led to a social media tussle between the BJP and MVA allies last week, with the latter terming the Opposition as “Maharashtra Drohi”. The Sena had slammed the BJP for playing politics during a crisis, with Thackeray reiterating it during his live address on Sunday.On Monday, BJP MP Narayan Rane also met governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to call for President’s rule in Maharashtra over “the state government’s failure and breakdown of public health machinery”.Pawar meets Governor Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar called on Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari at Raj Bhavan on Monday morning. The meeting assumes significance in the backdrop of the strained relationship between ruling parties in the state and Raj Bhavan.Senior party leader and former Union minister Praful Patel, who was present at the meeting, said, “It was a courtesy meeting. No political issues were discussed,” he said.There have been frequent tiffs between the Governor and Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress in the past six months of the government and even during the formation of the government last year. Ruling parties expect a truce between them after the meeting between Koshyari and Pawar. On Saturday, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut called on the Governor and had a discussion for over 30 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-centre-train-tussle-continues/story-c9sZE76C5jT0y8f69r362N.html
26-05-2020||Delhi||BJP, AAP spar over Covid numbers, beds||The BJP on Monday alleged the Delhi government could add only 200-odd beds for Covid-19 treatment in the last one-and-a-half months, a claim rejected by the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Referring to Arvind Kejriwal’s April 7 press conference, BJP MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the opposition in the Assembly, said, “Kejriwal had then said there are 2,950 beds available when the number of cases was just 525. When the cases crossed 14,000, the government has 3,150 beds as per an affidavit submitted by it in the Delhi high court on May 20. Today, he said there are 4,500 beds available. The government is misleading people. The CM had said they have made arrangements for 30,000 beds in the capital. Where are those beds?”AAP rejected the allegations. A party spokesperson said, “The BJP’s allegations are totally false and baseless. Their figures are wrong. The Delhi government is prepared with a clear plan to tackle corona. We have one of the best recovery rates in the country. Delhi has approximately 7,000 active cases, as against 14,000 alleged by the BJP. More than 6,700 patients have fully recovered and gone home.”Referring to the alleged discrepancy in figures in the Delhi government bulletin, Bidhuri said, “The number of patients undergoing treatment at health care and quarantine facilities, including home quarantine, don’t add up. For instance, there are 7,006 active cases as on May 25, but just 6,289 patients in various government facilities and home quarantine. Where are the rest of the positive cases?”To this, the AAP’s spokesperson responded, “There is no discrepancy...all patients are accounted for. Before sending patients into home isolation, there is a process whereby our ground teams visit patients to ensure they have adequate facilities required for home isolation. This is an on-ground verification process. Only after physical verification, the patients are sent to home isolation, Covid Care Centre, etc.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-aap-spar-over-covid-numbers-beds/story-QdjZFOTq2awGrFYnhQhGrK.html

The teams working on the ground will also make a database of such home quarantine cases, where all family members are in quarantine, in every sub-division which is to be updated in every 3-4 days, said the order that was issued by divisional commissioner Sanjeev Khirwar on Monday.The home isolated families would be allowed to call on the designated numbers and inform the surveillance officials about what essential commodities they need delivered. The nodal officer is supposed to check with each team head in every 3-4 days if the delivery process is in place, the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nodal-officers-for-people-under-home-quarantine/story-YvK70jWGXvIFdeiGHGM6rK.html

26-05-2020||Delhi||82 cancellations spark chaos as Delhi airport comes back to life||Sunil Kujur, a retired government employee, was woken up by an early morning call informing of his father’s demise. Kujur, a resident of west Delhi’s Uttam Nagar, reserved two seats for himself and his daughter on an Air India flight to Ranchi. Just when they were about to leave home, they learnt the flight had been cancelled. “I had to take an afternoon flight. I was late for my father’s last rites,” Kujur said.Having a reservation in the same cancelled Air India flight was a government hospital doctor, whose father had died on Monday morning. He later another flight to Ranchi but said there was no intimation about the cancellation.“There was not a single message or mail informing me about the cancellation. All of us who reached the airport today are mostly travelling in emergencies. If the airlines cannot keep the schedule on time, they must at least keep their passengers posted. This is sheer mismanagement, “ said the doctor, who wished not to be named. Kujur and the doctors were among scores of passengers whose flights were cancelled due to a multitude of reasons as airlines resumed operations across India on Monday. Instead of following the national guidelines issued by the Centre for all passengers, many set their own rules: Karnataka requires mandatory institutional quarantine for passengers from worst-affected states, while Punjab and Meghalaya have made a swab test mandatory for arrivals.Three states — Maharashtra, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu — requested the Centre government to reconsider the decision to allow domestic flight operations as it could lead to a spike in infections.At the Delhi airport, at least 82 flights, both departures and arrivals, were cancelled.According to Air India, flight schedules had to be redrawn late last evening by all airlines due to last-minute decision on general flight operations to certain states, inconveniencing passengers of multiple airlines. “Air India is doing its best to extend all support to its esteemed pax, according topmost priority to all safety norms, and in sync with the flight movement and operational issues prevailing throughout its network,” said an airline spokesperson. Domestic flight operations has been shut completely on March 25 when the Prime Minister had announced a nationwide lockdown in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Monday was the first day when airports in the country resumed domestic services since the lockdown. All passengers were wearing face masks. Many were seen wearing face shields and gloves. A few were even spotted wearing full-body protective suits. Most people flying out of Delhi on Monday said they were travelling because of emergency.Anil Mahapatra, an advocate who practises at a sessions court in Delhi, said he was going to Bhubaneswar to meet his mother who has been unwell for the past month. “My wife, who used to stay with my mother, had come to meet me in March and got stuck here due to the lockdown. Despite my mother being unwell we couldn’t visit her. She is old,” Mahapatra said.The lawyer, who travelled to the airport from Gurugram, said cabs were easily available and there was no overpricing.A majority of the people who were left stranded because of the cancelled flights complained that the operators “cared little” to inform them of the changes.Seva Singh, who was in Bhiwani of Haryana and runs a transport business in Raipur, was to board a Vistara flight. “My brother dropped me at the airport. There wasn’t any problem crossing the Gurugram border, but about an hour later, I found out that my flight had been cancelled. If the airline had alerted us in advance, it would have saved us time and money,” Singh said.The Delhi airport operator and the airlines took to social media to connect with their fliers. “Due to restrictions implemented by various local authorities, flights have got cancelled today. Stay in touch with the airline concerned for updated flight info. Planned flight operations for today are as follows: Departure- 118 flights, Arrival- 125 flights,” DIAL (Delhi International Airport Ltd) tweeted on Monday. Vistara airlines also took to Twitter, posting, “#ImportantUpdate: Many Indian states have issued their respective state-wise protocols that all entering passengers must follow. We advise to follow these guidelines for travel.”A few passengers, who had landed in Delhi, and were planning to travel further, were stuck on Monday.Among them was Komal Jaswal, who was stuck in Delhi because her flight to Pathankot was cancelled. Jaswal said she planned to hire a taxi to reach Punjab, where her family has been waiting for her for the past two months. “I work at a private firm in Pune. I had booked an IndiGo flight from Pune to Pathankot but it was cancelled. I had to book another flight with SpiceJet to reach Delhi and from here, I plan to hire a cab. It is better to travel for six to seven hours in a cab and reach home instead of spending a day at the airport,” she said.A spokesperson for IndiGo said, “IndiGo operations ran smoothly and as of today afternoon, 85% of our flights have reached their final destination within 30 minutes of scheduled arrival time. There were no major delays or any other disruptions. Due to the change in state guidelines, affected passengers were provided flexibility to either re-book on alternative flights or transfer their complete booking amount into credit shells for future bookings.”“IndiGo is ensuring to provide courteous and hassle-free travel experience for its passengers by following additional measures — website updated with all state requirements and SOPs for travel, and multiple mock drills for the staff to facilitate the new guidelines for flying,” the spokesperson added.A yoga instructor, Anjali Rai, who travelled from Bangalore to Delhi in a Vistara flight, claimed passengers were not following social distancing norms. “Despite the government advertising so much and holding repetitive campaigns, people are still negligent,” said Rai, who travelled wearing gloves, a face shield and a face mask. Rai, who lives in Panipat, said she was waiting for her brother to pick her up, as cabs were charging higher prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/82-cancellations-spark-chaos-on-day-one-as-delhi-airport-comes-back-to-life/story-MH3SwhPtY5GGhjRbhhsDbL.html

26-05-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: All 20 jail cases traced to asymptomatic officers||A string of measures — ban on biweekly visits from family members, segregation of new inmates to an isolated jail for the first 14 days and holding court proceedings through video conference from within the prison — has not been able to prevent the Covid-19 virus from creeping in to all the three jail complexes of Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli in Delhi.Till Monday evening, the three jailcomplexes, which together house a total of 14,000 prisoners and around 1800 jail officers, had reported 20 positive cases among prisoners and jail officials. Senior prison officers said that contact tracing so far has revealed that in all the three jails, the virus reached the prison through jail officers, who did not show any symptoms.At least 17 families living in different flats at the Tihar residential complex, located behind Tihar jail, have been told to go in home-quarantine for 14 days. “In at least 17 flats, the officers are in self-isolation. Around 60 people in those flats are in home isolation. The officials in Tihar and Rohini jail, who were infected with the virus, were both residents of Tihar quarters. Only the Mandoli deputy superintendent, who tested positive on ??, lived somewhere else,” said a prison officer, who did not wish to be named.Prison officers also said that barring the case of the Mandoli jail officer, all 19 prisoners and jail officials were asymptomatic. The officials fear that many more inside the prison may be infected with the virus and have ordered all jail superintendents to ensure that both prisoners and jail officers follow social distancing norms strictly.“At Rohini jail, we came to know that a 29-year-old prisoner had been infected with the virus after he was rushed to a hospital for surgery. By the time we were informed by the hospital, 15 inmates and one head warder had already contracted the disease. All the 15 prisoners were behind bars since the lockdown. They had no interaction with anyone outside. The head warder lived in Sonipat, Haryana which is a (coronavirus) hotspot. Later, another assistant superintendent of Rohini jail, who too lived in the Tihar residential complex, tested positive. The Tihar official, who tested positive on Sunday, is also a resident of the same complex. All the infected prisoners have been behind bars since the lockdown. The transmission has happened through asymptomatic jail officers. This is a practical problem. We can do little about it, except advising them to ensure social distancing,” a second prison officer, who did not wish to be named, said.Until Monday afternoon, Delhi had reported 14,053 cases of Covid-19, and 276 deaths. At least 6,771 people had recovered and been discharged from hospitals, the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin showed.To prevent the spread of the virus, around 3,000 inmates have been released on interim bail and parole. All new prisoners are being kept in isolation at jail number 2 for 14 days, before being shifted to other jails. The biweekly family visit of all prisoners were suspended in March. They are, however, in touch with their families through the prison’s landline phones. The prisons’ inspector general, Raj Kumar, said that many officers living in flats inside the residential complex were told to self-isolate as a precautionary measure. “ The complex is not a hotspot. It is a precaution that we are taking to contain the spread of the disease. There complex is a collection of flats, so we directed those families living in the same or adjacent building to self-isolate as a precaution. The sanitisation process is also being carried as a precaution. Inside the prison, all our officials, as well as prisoners, are following social distancing norms. We immediately quarantine a prisoner or any officials, if he/she shows any symptoms.”Dr Puneet Mishra, professor of Community Medicine at AIIMS said it is important to take more precautions in a prison, where inmates share space. “ The government is already decongesting the prison. Transmission through asymptomatic officers is a possibility if the infected prisoners were not new or were locked all these months. It is important to conduct periodic surveillance of all prisoners if cases have started showing inside the prisons. I am not sure how much of it is possible in a prison, where space is confined, but the prisoners must be advised to maintain social distancing, wash their hands several times, use masks and take all other precautions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-cases-reported-from-all-sealed-prisons-jailors-may-be-carriers/story-yYcJgGtnzX7bEMdxeS4sJK.html
26-05-2020||Delhi||Power demand goes up as mercury rises, curbs ease||As temperatures soaring in the national capital, the peak power demand in Delhi touched 5,268mw on Sunday evening — the highest so far for the season. An analysis of government data also showed that Delhi’s power demand increased by over 31% since lockdown curbs were relaxed on May 18 but the daily average demand was 11% lower than what was recorded during the same week last year. Officials in the power department attributed this to a spike in the use of air-conditioners.“The highest power demand for this season was 5,268mw, recorded at 11.10pm on Sunday. With the forecast of a heatwave, the demand is going to increase further in the coming days. The main factor behind the increase in demand is the cooling load. Power consumption has increased substantially at night due to the increase in air-conditioner use,” a senior official in the power department said.According to government data, around 50% of Delhi’s power demand in summers is due to the use ACs, coolers and fans.Parts of the city have been experiencing heatwave-like conditions since May 22, with the maximum temperature in Palam, Aya Nagar and Lodi Road often touching the 45°C mark. On Monday, the maximum temperature recorded at Safdarjung, considered the official recording of the city, was 44°C, four notches above the season’s normal. In Palam, the mercury rose to 46.2°C, so far the highest temperature recorded in the observatory this season. The India Meteorological Department has forecast that the heatwave is likely to continue till May 27. Data shows that over the past week, electricity consumption peaked in the city at night on most days. This, however, was not the case during the same period last year. “This is an indicator that even though the daytime consumption has seen a spurt, it is still not more than consumption at night. It means industries, offices and other commercial connections are yet to be fully operational in the city. The demand peaking at night reflects that domestic consumption is much higher. Otherwise, in this heat, all offices and commercial units would have been using ACs during the day,” a discom official said.Under the Delhi government’s revised lockdown rules, while shops are allowed to open in an ‘odd-even’ sequence, they must shut by 7pm every day. Offices and industries too have been allowed to operate at full strength, provided their workers are based in Delhi. Meanwhile, malls, bars, pubs, and restaurants across the Capital are still shut.According to government reports, on May 17, a day before the lockdown was relaxed, the peak power demand in Delhi was 4,000mw which shot up to 5,268mw within a week, on May 24. In comparison, the demand last year was 4,933mw on May 17 and 5,094mw on May 24. The demand for the month in 2019 had peaked on May 31 at 6,461mw. “The average peak power demand from May 17 to May 24 last year was 5,185mw. The same for this year was 4,619mw. With relaxations in the lockdown, there are signs of resumption in various economic activities, because of which the peak power demand in Delhi is gradually going to increase. This is normal for this time. It is expected to touch or breach the peak of 7,409mw recorded in July last year,” said a spokesperson of Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (TPDDL).On April 26, HT had reported that the first month of the lockdown had not only decreased Delhi’s daily average power demand by 35% over the previous year, but it also turned out to be a period with the lowest average electricity consumption in the Capital over the last 11 years at least.Delhi has effectively been under lockdown, in phases, from March 22.But, BSES, discoms and officials of the state power department said the primary reason for the increase in consumption was the “soaring temperature and heat wave”.“Sunday’s demand was more than the peak power demand (5,094 MW) recorded on May 24, 2019. In fact, this is the first time this month that Delhi’s peak power demand has crossed last year’s peak on any given day so far. On May 31 last year, the peak power demand was 6,461mw,” a BSES spokesperson said.On their part, the BRPL and BYPL successfully met the peak power demand of 2,448mw and 1,227mw respectively on Sunday night. Tata Power-DDL said it met the peak demand of 1,493mw.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/power-demand-shoots-up-under-eased-lockdown-in-delhi/story-iy9XRVl8h0pFcuQVTJERNK.html
26-05-2020||City||Fire-fighting ops at Ludhiana woollen mill last for 12 hours, inquiry initiated||It took more than 12 hours for fire fighters to douse the flames that had broken out at RT Woollen Mill, RK Road, on Sunday. As many as 14 fire tenders were deployed at the spot with over 60 fire fighters working to douse the flames. The fire broke out around 12:30pm on Sunday and the reason behind it is uncertain. The double storey building spread on 1,500 square yards was damaged badly and material worth lakhs was gutted in the incident. No casualty was reported at the spot.‘COTTON, POLYESTER AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS GUTTED’ Sub-fire officer (SFO) Maninder Singh said, “It was difficult even to enter the building due to the heat that was being emitted out of the building. I led a team of fire fighters to the roof of a building situated on the backside of the unit on fire and made a hole in the boundary wall so the intensity of heat could reduce inside the factory. Most of the material comprised cotton, polyester and petroleum products due to which it took more time to douse the flames.”One of the fire fighters, requesting anonymity, said the fire fighters also faced trouble in absence of safety suits. “If the department had given suits to the fire fighters, we might have entered the building and doused the flames faster. We could not enter the building due to the heat,” he said. The fire official also said, “We do not have proper equipment and in absence of this, we cover ourselves with wet clothes. The civic body and the state government have been making tall claims in the past, but nothing has been done to improve the condition of the fire brigade.”Assistant divisional fire officer Bhupinder Singh said the 14 fire tenders deployed at the spot were refilled for over 100 times. INQUIRY INITIATED BY SDM WESTAfter chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh directed deputy commissioner (DC) Pradeep Agrawal to look into the reason behind the fire incident, the DC has marked an inquiry in the matter to sub-divisional magistrate (SDM, west) Amrinder Malhi.SDM Malhi said he visited the spot on Monday and initiated the inquiry. “We have asked the owner to submit documents regarding the factory following which we will move forward with the inquiry. We could not enter the building as the smoke was still emanating out of the waste and reason behind the fire incident is uncertain.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fire-fighting-operations-at-ludhiana-woollen-mill-continue-for-12-hours-inquiry-initiated/story-g8ozoADdG7cIptikrSzQcK.html
26-05-2020||City||Lack of work disheartening for daily wagers back at labour chowks in and around Chandigarh||Almost deserted for two months after the Covid-19 curfew and lockdown, labour chowks where semi-skilled workers collect to be hired for short-term manual work, are seeing some activity, but there are hardly any jobs available.Those who are lucky to get some work say they have to deal with tough bargaining from contractors and often settle for lower wages.“I have come here every day in the last one week, but was hired only for two days,” says Mohammed Rustum, a mason at the Zirakpur-Shimla labour chowk in Zirakpur.Rustom, who moved to Mohali 10 years ago from Muzaffarpur in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and now rents a house in Baltana with his brother, says, “I had registered for the Shramik trains (special services for migrants) but it was difficult to get a ticket so I stayed back as construction activity started in the district. Walking home was not an option.” Moinuddin, a mason waiting at Madanpura chowk in Mohali, says earlier he would get some work within an hour after reaching the chowk. “Now there is no work. Only a handful of people get picked up.” “All construction and other projects have been held up after the lockdown and because of the migrant exodus we are not getting any work,” says Hira Lal, a contractor.Things, however, are not that bleak as work on some unfinished projects has started, he adds.‘People want to work with fewer people’Anuj Pandey, a contractor working in Chandigarh for the past 15 years, has been forced to return to his village in Chhapra, Bihar, as his savings ran out. Most of the contractors, he says on phone, have gone back to their villages and towns in the state and in UP. “ I and five other contractors with a team of 15 men have had a tough journey back. Almost 80% of the workforce has exited from cities because no work is available,” he says.Those who are left behind, too, are finding it hard to get work.Pandey, who used to supply manpower to the local industrial units in Chandigarh, adds, “Industrialists stopped responding to calls from labourers who were in dire need of money.” Echoing the same sentiment, Kanwaljeet Singh, president, All India Central Council of Trade Unions, said, “The labour involved in construction work has almost vanished. There is no drop in wage rates but demand for labour has dipped as people want to work with fewer people given social distancing rules.”No one stepping out in PanchkulaThe old labour chowk near Sector 17, Panchkula, bustling with activity once, remains deserted as people are not too keen to step out during the lockdown or hire workers.“Most of the labourers have returned to UP. Only a few who have settled down here are available for work, which anyway is scarce,” says Rajesh Kumar, a mason from Haripur village in Sector 4.Many local workers are not able to move out of Rajiv Colony near Sector 17 where they live as it has been declared a partial containment zone after a milk vendor tested positive earlier this month. Labourers are also being forced to deal with tough bargaining by contractors.“Earlier there was little room for bargaining,” says Rupali Devi who has been lucky to get work for four days in a week. “Now we are ready to work for any amount below Rs 300.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lack-of-work-disheartening-for-daily-wagers-back-at-labour-chowks-in-and-around-chandigarh/story-Eqq1QIPNWZr92PEq7k0QtL.html
26-05-2020||Pune||Pimpri-Chinchwad resumes operations, sees more Covid cases||PUNE: The industrial town of Pimpri-Chinchwad which had successfully kept Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection spread under control is now witnessing a sudden rise in the cases since the trade and industries operations resumed.As the number of Covid-19 cases went down the city administration took a call to relax the lockdown restrictions. According to Shravan Hardikar, municipal commissioner Pimpri-Chinchwad, the sudden rise in the number of cases has got nothing to do with relaxations on restrictions but instead concentrated cases in just one area. The PCMC decided to relax restrictions at the beginning of May and companies were asked to start operations with limited staff. This was later increased to full strength by May 22 and the public buses too have now been allowed to ply with 50 per cent strength.As of May 7, PCMC limits had 151 cases while as of May 24 this went up to 354. The area also recorded seven deaths among the residents of PCMC as of May 24.The fresh cases have forced PCMC to announce Anandnagar as a containment zone. While new cases are coming, as many as 170 people have been discharged till May 24.Hardikar said, “The sudden rise in the number of cases has only coincided with the opening of industries. If we deduct the 150 cases which all come from one slum area of Anandnagar then there are only sporadic cases like two or three cases daily. The rise in cases in the past few days has nothing to do with the industries.”“The infected have no travel history to the industries but are front line workers like loaders and sanitation workers. We started aggressive testing and contact tracing thereafter and so the number of cases went up,” he said.“There would be no shortage of cases in the PCMC area unless the active cases reach to 8,000 which is far fetched given that the number of active cases currently is only 155 as of Sunday,” said Hardikar.Dr Pawan Salve, chief health officer, PCMC, said, “We have seen some cases after the restrictions were lifted, however, we will have no shortage of beds given that we estimate around 200 cases by May end and 400 by June end and we have about 24,00 beds already in YCM hospital.”“We have also streamlined the testing strategy as per the new Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines to detect the infected soon as possible,” Said Dr Salve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fresh-covid-19-cases-reported-in-pcmc-as-trade-operations-resume/story-4abAiVGX4dKx5Xidu8fWhL.html
26-05-2020||Pune||Export of agricultural commodities rises despite lockdown||India’s export of agriculture based commodities such as garlic, lemons, chilies and bananas have been higher this year than previous years, despite the national lockdown.According to an official from the Maharashtra state agricultural marketing board (MSAMB), India’s export in April and May 2020 has been higher than May 2019.The MSAMB export data shows that from April 1 to May 19 this year, the total export of garlic stood at 1168 metric tonnes while it was 846 metric tonnes last year during the corresponding period.Lemons also reported a higher export with 653 metric tonnes compared to 283 metric tonnes last year while chillies stood at 1522 metric tonnes compared to 1409 metric tonnes last year and bananas at 33948 metric tonnes which was 23456 metric tonnes last year.Most of the export happened through the sea route and for countries in the Middle East, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and other neighbouring countries. Mangoes and grapes were the only fruit that went by air to Europe.MSAMB managing director Sunil Pawar said, “Despite other sectors affected badly due to Covid-19, we have been able to save the agriculture export.”According to Pawar, agriculture export mainly increased for bananas, lemons, chilies, and garlic.“During the period from April 1 to May 19, total 17051 metric tonnes commodities were exported from JNPT and airways and almost 90 percentage of share is from Maharashtra. In the same period during 2019, a total 18389 metric tonnes commodities got exported which shows only 7 per cent less than previous year.”Pawar said the state government has created the central control room at Vashi in Mumbai which has helped to give single window licences for everything.india@123i||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/export-of-agricultural-commodities-rises-despite-lockdown/story-xthJ8v3Kt0rNW59O93KEIL.html
26-05-2020||Pune||From Pune to West Bengal, this truck driver braved heat, rain to ensure migrants get home||Bhagwat Solunkhe, 30, is one of the many people who contributed in helping the migrant labours in Pune reach their native places. Solunkhe took a group of 20 labourers from Pune to Kolkata before the cyclone Amphan hit the eastern coast and derailed all migrant movement.Even though the journey did not provide comforts like a bed or fan to counter the sweltering heat, he recounts the journey nonchalantly.“It had started pouring there when we left. The journey back was arduous. too. I reached home only on Sunday,” said Solunkhe.The truck was a paid service which had police permit from Pune rural police - Wagheshwar parking in Wagjoli to Nadia district in West Bengal. The truck stopped once for a bath in Nagpur and midway for food but never for sleep.“Yes, we were giving permissions to people who were arranging for their own vehicles but instructed them to maintain social distance. We have maintained due records of all,” said senior police inspector Pratap Mankar of Lonikand police station. However, it had to stop after the cyclone.Their journey started on May 14 and ended in Krishnanagar, Nadia, according to Solunkhe.“It was tiring. After all we did not stop at all for almost four days. There were sleeping arrangements made for migrants in the truck. The co-driver Sadashiv Mange, 37, was driving when I slept,” said Solunkhe.The truck was sanitised before leaving and the drivers as well as the passengers were given masks added Solunkhe.“We paid Rs 5,250 each for the journey. When in Maharashtra, we got food, but once we left the borders, it was difficult to get food,” said Asabuddin Sheikh, 45, a resident of Nadia who travelled in the truck. Shaikh used to work at a construction site in Hinjewadi Phase 1.The food, Solunkhe recalls, was filling within Maharashtra border. However, the food served after they crossed the border was not enough and left them famished. “They were serving whatever best they could - poha, jaggery, banana, biscuits, but that was not enough as in Maharashtra we were provided with a proper meal of chapati-bhaji,” he recalls.The truck passed through Ahmednagar, Jalna, Akola, and Nagpur before crossing into Chattishgarh where the truck stopped in Raipur and Sambalpur before entering into West Bengal where the truck stopped in Khadakpur.The truck was one of the last ones to get a permit to travel to West Bengal as the cyclone hit. The Shramik trains to the state were also stopped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/from-pune-to-west-bengal-this-driver-braved-heat-rain-to-ensure-migrants-get-home/story-07xfE9XN1kbCS8hKonHyMI.html

Thoughts are with the Derby sangat (community) who have been providing 500 meals a day from Guru Arjan Dev Gurdwara,” she said.Images of the person caught on CCTV entering the premises were shared by the gurdwara on social media, while reporting the incident, causing concern and demands for his arrest.The gurdwara said in a statement: “This morning at 6am, an individual entered the gurdwara premises causing thousands of pounds of damage…We can confirm that no individuals were injured and that the clean-up process has begun.” “This hate crime or any sort of crime against a Sikh will never deter us in our practice of seva (service) and simran (prayer). We will continue the service for the community with langar and continue to stream live nitnem (daily prayers). We will ensure the safety of all our sevadars (volunteers) and employees,” it added.Gurdwaras across the UK have been recipients of funding as part of a government scheme to install security equipment to prevent hate crime in places of worship, but such incidents have continued. The accused has been arrested. The Derbyshire police said, “The Guru Arjan Dev Gurdwara on Cromwell Road was broken into and we believe the assault and break in are linked. We were called just before 8.40am with reports of the break in, which is understood to have happened sometime in the early hours.”“A man who was earlier arrested in connection with the assault in Normanton Road has also been arrested on suspicion of burglary in relation to this incident. We would like to reassure the local community that our investigations into both incidents continue and we do not believe there to be any one else involved,”police said.

26-05-2020||Pune||Grocery wholesale at Market Yard reopens after a week, strict guidelines for traders in Pune||The Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), a wholesale grocery market at Pune’s Market Yard, reopened on Monday, after almost a week.The market had been closed since May 19 after eight people including two traders tested positive for Covid-19. The market was allowed to reopen following a meeting between Poona Merchants Chamber Association and the Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram during which he also addressed the concerns of the traders about Covid. APMC, Pune has issued strict guidelines for traders following the reopening including thermal scanning of those visiting the market, using face masks and restricting the number of trucks allowed to enter the market. “As it is a huge grocery market with at least 400 shops, daily hundreds of trucks come to the market for unloading the goods. However, from today onwards, only 100 trucks will be allowed during the day from gate no. 5 of Market Yard. Our security guards will check the body temperature of every person entering the market through thermal scanners. Social distancing, taking all the necessary safety precautions like sanitising the shop daily, use of mask and gloves is mandatory for the traders,” said Balasaheb Deshmukh, chairman APMC, Pune.Pune police department has deployed policemen and temporary check posts on the Market Yard road to monitor the vehicular movement and crowding. As the market was closed since the last few days, several goods trucks coming from outside Pune were selling goods on Satara Road. It has now been stopped and action is being taken by the police department.Mahesh Rathi, one of the traders who has a shop in Market Yard, said, “As the market was closed since the last few days, we were not able to unload our goods coming from outside the state. Most of the trucks are standing outside Pune city on highways, waiting to unload the goods. It’s a relief now that the market has reopened and we can supply necessary groceries and food grains to the city retailers. At the same time we are taking all the precautions. All the workers coming to our godown are being sanitised. None of the workers living in containment zone are allowed to come for work and we are giving them full salary.”Though the wholesale grocery market has reopened, the APMC vegetable market remains closed. It is likely to open after a meeting on Tuesday between traders and APMC officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-19-pune-s-wholesale-market-reopens-after-a-week-strict-guidelines-for-traders/story-ywSwf7epXFIXt0DshYTYBJ.html

26-05-2020||Chandigarh||Covid crisis: Cobblers in Chandigarh finding it hard to cobble a living||Rs 30, Rs 20, zero. This is how much Vakil Ravidas, a 50-year-old cobbler with a family of six to feed, has managed to earn in the past three days.Putting up in one-room rented accommodation in Faidan Nizampur village in Chandigarh, Ravidas was eagerly waiting for the relaxation in the lockdown, but all his hopes of making a decent income dashed as hardly anyone from the residential societies near his working area in Sector 48 visited him in the past three days amid fear of coronavirus spread.Having spent all his savings during the past couple of months, Ravidas, a native of Katihar in Bihar, said, “My roadside counter has been closed for 40 days. My last earning was of Rs 400 on March 21 and after that everything was shut. Whatever the savings I had, I spent it on the food and last month’s rent. For almost two days, my elder son and I slept on an empty stomach. Then I got some ration from the administration and Bihar government deposited Rs 1,000 in my account, which helped me pull through the curfew period.” Ravidas is among the 200 cobblers in city, who were not relocated when vendor-free zones were established across Chandigarh, and were allowed to operate from their old workplaces as the profession was one of the essential services. But the present situation has spelled a hard time for them to get their business back on track.“It was only on Tuesday that a plumber got his shoe polished and a sanitation worker got his footwear stitched that I earned Rs 30. Earlier I used to earn anything between Rs 200 to Rs 600 a day and the monthly earning touched Rs 12,000,” adds Ravidas, a third generation cobbler, who doesn’t want any of his three sons and a daughter to pick the craft. With his eldest son studying in BA, the other two in school, and the daughter a student of Class 2, Ravidas can only “hopes things improve in the coming days, otherwise the family will have to stand in long queues to get food.” I don’t want to beg, he says.‘THINGS ARE GETTING WORSE’ “Those sitting in the market area are still able to earn Rs 100 daily, but the ones in the residential areas are even not able to earn enough to have two meals for a single person,” says Hari Lal, 58, who operates from the inner market of Sector 18. “For saving maximum money, I left the quarters two years ago and started sleeping in the malaria office. But now things are getting worse. What will I earn? What will I save? I am planning to go back to my native place Gajpati Khera in Rai Bareli (Uttar Pradesh) for a couple of months and will return when things get normal,” adds Hari. “Generations of our family have been into mending shoes. This is the only craft we know. Hope things get better soon and we will able to live with dignity. Nobody likes to live on the mercy of others,” says Alopi Prasad, a cobbler who operates from the inner market of Sector 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-crisis-cobblers-in-chandigarh-finding-it-hard-to-cobble-a-living/story-a89qJJdzfj6WnVF4Fmsn0N.html
