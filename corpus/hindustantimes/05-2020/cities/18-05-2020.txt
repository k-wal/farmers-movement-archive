18-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC to reserve 520 ICU beds at private hospitals||As the Covid-19 cases in Mumbai increased to almost 20,000, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to reserve 520 intensive care unit (ICU) beds at private hospitals for Covid patients. This will increase the total ICU bed strength in the city to 1,020.“At present, we have around 500 ICU beds for Covid-19 patients. But considering the growing number of cases, we have initiated talks with private hospitals to include another 520 ICU beds under our capacity. This will help to increase the total ICU bed strength to 1,020 in Mumbai,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner (health), BMC.After receiving several complaints that private hospitals were overcharging patients, BMC has decided to keep the billing of referred patients under its hold. “Private hospitals will not directly provide bills to patients. BMC will decide on the bill. Though, we are yet to take some decision on it,” said Kakani.Despite the increase in beds, medical experts claim that this is not sufficient to cater to the patients in Mumbai. The city requires at least 4,000 ICU beds. “The next 20 days are very crucial for us. We are expecting that in this period, we may have to arrange ICU beds for around 6,000 patients. At present, only seven to eight patients out of 100 require ICU facilities,” said Dr Om Srivastava, city-based epidemiologist.Around 5% of the total Covid patients in Maharashtra are critically ill. “We don’t know how long patients will occupy beds so we have to be prepared with additional beds so that we don’t face a shortage,” said Srivastava.According to experts, not all patients infected with the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, require ICU beds. Almost 80% of them only require oxygen support for breathing difficulties. Taking note of this, BMC has decided to increase beds with oxygen facilities to at least 3,000.The civic body is also planning to install 250 high dependency units (HDUs) in makeshift structures. HDUs are wards for people who need more intensive observation, treatment, and nursing care than is possible in a general ward, but slightly less than that given in intensive care.BMC inaugurated 800 beds with oxygen supply, 200 normal beds and 50 HDU beds at the MMRDA ground in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC). The care centre is expecting another 100 more beds by May 25. At the National Sports Club of India (NSCI) facility, BMC will install 600 beds with oxygen and 50 HDU beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-reserve-520-icu-beds-at-private-hospitals/story-LPEbw8Ada4YPVU1k3tJQTN.html
18-05-2020||Mumbai||1.61 lakh stranded migrants sent back home; Mumbai Police say urgent need for more trains||The Mumbai Police, till Monday, sent 161,261 stranded people, most of them migrant labourers, back to their home states, while over 3 lakh are still on the waiting list. Pranaya Ashok, DCP (ops) and Mumbai Police spokesperson confirmed the updated figures.Mumbai Police fears the exercise of sending back stranded people may take more than a month if the number of trains is not increased significantly this month.“Many have left on foot without registering with us as they see registered people getting frustrated waiting for several days; hence more trains are needed. Another issue is, we need over a thousand people in one group for one train, otherwise, we have to make them wait till we reach that figure,” said a senior police officer.One of the deputy commissioners of Mumbai, who acts as a nodal officer, said, “The response from Uttar Pradesh has been good so far but West Bengal (WB) needs to provide more trains. The WB government has given just eight trains to Mumbai when more than double that amount is needed.”“The task of sending the migrants back is tedious and a lot of logistical movement is involved. We have to arrange their travel right from their residence until the railway station while ensuring we maintain social distancing. Also, there is a waiting time of six hours. The documentation and identity of every migrant are checked because tomorrow if he/she turns positive, then the documentation will be crucial for contact tracing,” added the officer.651 positive in Mumbai PoliceThe Mumbai Police has reported 651 cases so far. Among all police stations, JJ Marg (46 cases) and Sahar police station (26 cases) are the worst hit.

18-05-2020||Chandigarh||126 Punjab civic bodies’ terms over, polls not likely till Sept||Even as the terms of nine municipal corporations and 117 municipal councils and notified area committees in Punjab came to an end between March 8 and April 26, the elections to these urban local bodies are likely to go beyond August in view of the Covid-19 outbreak.The government has appointed administrators to run the operations of the bodies, including the Mohali, Bathinda, Moga, Batala, Hoshiarpur, Phagwara, Kapurthala and Pathankot municipal corporations. Punjab has a total of 167 urban local bodies.The state government in February had announced that civic body polls will held in June and July. “We have appointed officers as administrators so that the work is not affected. There no denying an uncertainty over the poll schedule,” said local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra.As per the Municipal Corporation Act, 1911, the civic bodies must go to the polls within six months of expiry of their term. This means the administrators cannot function beyond six months.While Bathinda, Moga and Mohali had mayors owing allegiance to the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Phagwara, Pathankot and Hoshiarpur had mayors linked to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Civic bodies of Abohar, Kapurthala and Batala were also given the status of municipal corporation but they are still to get an elected body as the delimitation of wards is underway.Most of the councils and notified area committees, whose term has ended, have presidents and a majority of members from the SAD-BJP as they went to the polls when the alliance was in power in Punjab.Mohali mayor Kulwant Singh on being contacted said 250 development works proposed by the MC awaited clearance from the local bodies department.“Now, the government will push the development works. The Congress government wants to take credit for the works which were planned by us,” he said.“We are not biased against anyone. In the wake of coronavirus outbreak, sanitation was a huge challenge. We kept all cities and towns clean,” said minister Mohindra.“Since life is coming back to normal I will ask request the minister in-charge to hold a meeting on further course of action,” said rural development and panchayats minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, who is part of a committee constituted by the CM to decide on the civic body polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/126-punjab-civic-bodies-terms-over-polls-not-likely-till-sept/story-aOydwnMtpGc7DpsbtWMtBI.html

We are trying to base a simple promotion formula for students from traditional courses as well, and the same will be announced soon,” said Vinod Patil, controller of examination, MU. He added that the exam timetable and duration of exams for final year students will be announced later.The education minister in his brief earlier this month had requested state universities to schedule all final year exams between July 1 and 30, however, he added that in case the current lockdown situation extends beyond June 30, another meeting will be held to decide the future of final year students.“We’ve been told that between June 20 and 25 there’ll be a final call on the status of final year exams, so until then, we want students to focus on their studies and not worry about anything else,” said an official from MU.The circular also said that students with allowed-to-keep-term (ATKT) remarks in their previous semesters will be promoted to the next academic year. “Instead of wasting another academic year, these students are being given a chance to get promoted to the next year, provided they clear these subjects within 120 days of the start of the 2020-21 academic year,” states the university circular. It further highlights that ATKT exams for final year students will also be scheduled to take place between July 1 and 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mu-releases-gradation-formula-for-non-traditional-courses/story-RIhetGz7FXHiJXttwVYmYM.html

In the PIL, he had sought directions to the administration to take a balanced decision regarding charging of school fees on the basis of financial status of each school after getting their balance sheets and income and expenditure accounts examined.He had alleged that most of the private schools have failed to upload their balance sheets on their websites even though the Fee Regulatory Act has been in force in Chandigarh since April 2018. The Act mandates while deciding or increasing the fee of each school, the financial status and its expenditure are required to be considered, the court was told.The UT administration and 77 private schools are at loggerheads over fee collection issue. The UT in March had barred schools from collecting fee for the 2020-21 session in view of the Covid-19 outbreak, a decision challenged by schools in the HC. Schools have stopped salary payment to teachers claiming that they do not have funds. The UT had asked them to upload balance sheets, which most schools are yet to put in public domain. Now, the UT has to take a call whether schools be allowed to charge certain amount or not.The HC bench of chief justice RS Jha and justice Arun Palli, which heard the case on Monday, has disposed it of while granting liberty to the petitioner to approach the administration with complaints if any, against violation by any school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/will-act-against-schools-not-following-fee-collection-norms-chandigarh-admn-to-hc/story-uRjjx80jO9OGv22dDjff6M.html

18-05-2020||Mumbai||Amitabh Gupta reinstated, will also head panel for migrants||After 37 days, senior IPS officer Amitabh Gupta was reinstated to his original position as principal secretary (special) of the state home department and is also appointed as head of a committee formed to assist police stations in Mumbai to compile a list of migrant workers willing to go back to their respective states. The committee is also expected to provide staff from various government departments to the police stations for compiling and uploading the list on the government website. Gupta was sent on compulsory leave on April 10 after it was found that he facilitated the travel of Diwan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL) promoters Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan by issuing a letter last month. A fact-finding committee headed by Manoj Saunik, additional chief secretary, finance, in its report found that the senior official exceeded his jurisdiction and had no authority to issue such a letter. It further stated that the mala fide intention could not be established as it needed further probe by a proper investigation agency. The report also recommended that even if the state government accepted his explanation, he should be warned and given cautionary advice to check the background of the person before extending any such help.Amitabh Gupta had accepted that the letter was issued by him. He admitted that he should not have issued it, but insisted that it was done on humanitarian grounds, stated the probe report.On Monday, a three-member committee was been formed to assist the police staff in compiling the list of migrants who wants to undertake travel to their respective states and other related works. The committee is headed Gupta along with Vinay Chaube, joint commissioner of police, Mumbai and Rahul Kulkarni, deputy secretary, general administration department, states the order issued by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta. “The committee will provide required additional manpower for assisting the local police station in Mumbai city for compiling, collating uploading and processing the data in the National Migrant Information System (NMIS) portal of Government of India. As per the requirement, the committee will requisite and deploy manpower (age less than 40 years) from Mantralaya and other field officials of various government departments. All the head of the department shall assist and provide manpower as requisitioned by the said committee as emergency essential services till May 31,” it states further.“Gupta resumed charge as principal secretary on Saturday. He, however, was also warned of not repeating any such action in the future,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.The Wadhawan family comprising 23 members travelled to Mahabaleshwar, bypassing sealed district borders aided by a letter given by Gupta on his letterhead as the principal secretary (special), home department amid national lockdown. This led to a controversy as the opposition parties raised questions on whose orders the letter was issued. Kapil and Dheeraj are accused in DHFL scam and had been issued non-bailable warrants by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The family, along with other outsiders, had travelled from Khandala to Mahabaleshwar in their cars even when the borders of Satara and Pune districts were sealed amid the lockdown.Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sought a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry into the reinstatement of Gupta as well as the entire Wadhawan incident. Leader of Opposition, Devendra Fadnavis said, “Amitabh Gupta, who had given a transit pass to CBI accused Wadhawans has been re-instated on his post. At that time also I had said that such a pass cannot be given by official on his own unless important politicians in the government give such a signal or ask him to do so. His reinstatement makes it clear that some important people who run the government ensured Wadhawans got the transit pass. We want this entire incident to be inquired by the CBI.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/amitabh-gupta-reinstated-will-also-head-panel-for-migrants/story-Qix4Qy9zwBc4RBJTkJ10BN.html

18-05-2020||Mumbai||Hospitals have no beds, allege Chembur and Govandi residents||Despite Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) claims of setting up thousands of beds in its facilities, the situation on the ground highlights a cruel reality. Many patients have been turned away by civic hospitals and some have even lost lives during their struggle to find a bed.A family from Chembur said that they visited five hospitals to get their kin admitted as she had clear symptoms of Covid-19, however, no hospital agreed to admit her. Later, she succumbed to the infection. “I never felt so helpless. I did when I could not save my mother. I was ready to put in all money from my savings, but no hospital was ready to admit her,” said Shyam Alhat, a resident of Gaikwad Nagar in Chembur.He said, “My 62-year-old mother had a recurring fever since May 1 and we visited three municipal hospitals and two private hospitals. I stood in the queues for four to five hours in every hospital with my ailing mother and all of them just gave medicines and sent us home. She died at home after four days. She could have been saved,”Meanwhile, BMC’s data states that the city has over 35,000 bed capacity in its Covid Care Centre -2 (CCC-2) facilities and over 24,000 bed capacity in its CCC1 facilities. While a CCC-2 is meant for quarantining mild symptomatic and asymptomatic Covid-19 positive patients, CCC1 is for high-risk contacts and those awaiting test results. Apart from this, there are 475 ICU beds and nearly 4200 beds in dedicated Covid hospitals.In another similar incident, a 38-year-old patient from Govandi could not find a bed for four days and was turned away from every BMC hospital he approached. Deepak Parchapa, brother of the deceased, said, “My elder brother suddenly developed Covid symptoms and we rushed him to Rajawadi hospital on May 3. The medical staff informed us that there were no beds. We went to Sion Hospital and then to Kasturba. There they asked us to visit Sir JJ Hospital. We moved from one hospital to the other for two days while my brother’s health condition worsened.” Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar said, “Majority of the beds of Covid patients are full. However, we are continuously scaling up the bed capacity. Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) today handed over 1,200 bed facility set up at BKC. Also, an online dashboard for bed availability for public is being discussed and a proper management of beds will be executed in the coming days.”Even as BMC claims to have set up various facilities and scaled up the total bed capacity, local representatives say that there is a lack of management in place to accommodate these patients in the hospital. Abhijeet Samant, BJP corporator from Andheri, said, “Almost every day we come across cases where citizens are unable to find a bed for days. Unless we make calls to the ward office or hospital’s medical staff, the patient is not admitted.” Samant added that the helpline where people can inquire for beds does not work at all. He said, “It is complete chaos on the ground.”Pointing out the mismanagement of hospital beds in the city, Maharashtra leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis tweeted, “I am constantly getting calls from relatives of patients in Mumbai telling me that how they are not getting admission in any of the hospitals and have to run from pillar to post.” Fadnavis urged the state government to create a dashboard for bed availability and put it up in the public domain. He further said in the tweet, “I request the State Government to create a dashboard for bed availability and put it in the public domain so that everyone knows in which hospital should they go for admission and treatment based on the availability of beds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hospitals-have-no-beds-allege-chembur-and-govandi-residents/story-kiQietaBxIUi9T0mMePJCN.html

According to police officials, the incident came to light after the police control room received a call from a hospital around 11 am.“It seems like the woman had been shot and then taken to the hospital by the suspects themselves, where she was declared brought dead. The hospital then called up the police and a team was rushed to the spot from where the woman’s body was sent for an autopsy,” said Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police, women safety.The woman was identified as Rachna Sharma, who had married Dadri resident Vipin Sharma in 2014.

18-05-2020||Noida||Fire in high-rise, residents allege faulty equipment||A fire broke out in front of a flat on the 23rd floor of a high-rise in Sector 137 early Monday morning. The cause of the fire remains unknown. There was no casualty in the incident, officials of the fire department said.The incident took place around 5am at Paras Tierea society, after which two fire tenders rushed to the spot, the officials said.“An elderly couple lives in the house. They had to be rescued through the adjacent flat as the fire broke out in front of their house, blocking the exit. The cause of the fire is not clear as of now, but it seems to be an electrical fault,” chief fire officer (CFO) Arun Kumar Singh said.The officials identified the couple as Nand Kishor Sharma (65) and his wife Kiran (61), who sustained a sprain in her leg during the incident. While they escaped almost unhurt, the house was completely gutted.The residents of the high-rise were very appreciative of the timely response by two security guards, one stationed at the tower and the other patrolling the society.“The tower guard jumped from the adjacent flat’s balcony to the balcony of the burning flat and helped the couple escape. The guards’ brave and prompt action saved the day and we will reward them,” Vikas Khosla, the general manager of the society, said.The incident has highlighted the lack of preparedness to battle high-rise fires in Noida. Firemen had to rescue the couple from within the building and the fire also had to be controlled that way. However, the fire broke out on the 23rd floor, while the hydraulic platform with the department was only 42 metres high (approximately 14 floors).The CFO also said that the society’s firefighting equipment took a while to become operational after a while, and although that led to a delay, the fire was brought under control within an hour.Residents, however, alleged that the society’s system was faulty.“My wife woke me up around 4.30am saying that there was smoke in the house. We immediately rushed downstairs and by then we could hear people in the other flat shouting for help. We alerted the tower guard who manually raised a fire alarm—there was no automatic fire alarm. The entrance to the house had a grill door, so the guard went in through the adjacent house, which was empty. We could see smoke coming out of the main door but no water, indicating that the sprinklers had not worked. Also, out of 20 fire cylinders that were used, only 2-3 worked. Even the hydraulic system finally used to get the fire under control started working only after a while. We were lucky that the fire neither spread nor were there any casualties. But it was a near-miss. A few more minutes and the situation could have been much worse,” NJ Mattoo, a resident of the flat above the one that was burnt, said.The society staff, however, said that the equipment was working.“We don’t know the cause of the fire yet, but it seems to have originated in the storeroom. They had a piped gas connection so there was no cylinder in the house. We helped control the fire as soon as possible and all our equipment was working,” the facilities manager, Hari Om Kashyap, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/fire-in-high-rise-residents-allege-faulty-equipment/story-RKgHGINp9GIXVKg1Q2rtfK.html
18-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Sampling centre to be shifted out of L2 Covid hospital||The district health department has planned to shift the Covid-19 sampling centre of the Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital, which is an L-2 category dedicated Covid hospital and is currently treating 21 cases of Covid-19 positive patients, who have arrived within the last three days.“The hospital area is now a highly infectious zone and a containment area. So, we have planned to shift the sampling centre to our quarantine centre at Govindpuram. Due to the arrival of Covid patients, we did not call suspected cases to the sampling centre on Monday, while Sunday was an off day. It was only on Saturday that suspected patients came to the facility despite the presence of Covid patients,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO).“As per the protocol, it is not advised to have sampling centre at a Covid treatment facility. We have two other quarantine centres, where sampling of suspected cases, as well as the entry of the general public, are allowed. The two are at RKGIT College on Delhi Meerut Road, and at the engineering college in Dasna. There are norms that those giving samples should stay in home quarantine till their reports are received,” CMO added.The UP government has come up with a three-tier dedicated Covid hospital system across the state. The L-1 category hospitals are meant for Covid-19 positive patients having no complications while the L-2 category hospitals are meant for patients who have moderate complications. The L-3 category hospitals are meant for admission of patients requiring critical care.The CMO further added that there was a recent case when a man from Bihar had come for sampling in Ghaziabad and his reports turned positive. “We searched for him but the man had fled to Bihar while giving us a fake address in Ghaziabad. So, it will now be mandatory for all those who give samples to remain in home quarantine till the reports are received. Their proper identification and addresses will also be maintained,” CMO added.Meanwhile, residents’ welfare association (RWA) of Kaushambi Apartments served a legal notice to the district magistrate, CMO and other officials for their alleged inaction to seal and take up proper sanitisation of a residential building, from where a Covid-19 positive case was reported on May 15.“Ever since the case came to light on May 15, we have been requesting the officials for proper sanitization of the building, apart from taking up sampling of close contacts of the patients. But there was no response from officials. We had no option left but to serve the officials concerned a legal notice. Our right to life has been violated by the inaction on part of the officials.So we informed them through a legal notice that we will be moving to Supreme Court in a petition,” said VK Mittal, president of KARWA.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls and messages over the issue. “We have taken up sanitisation of the building and sealing order has been issued for the building at Kaushambi. On Monday we have three more positive cases, which has taken our tally to 189. The three cases are from Loni, Kadkad Model and Pasonda in Sahibabad,” the CMO added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-sampling-centre-to-be-shifted-out-of-l2-covid-hospital/story-rBVXE9bHfoC9XuVpQxZLoJ.html

On Sunday, more than 70 migrant labourers had entered Panihari village in the district from Punjab’s Bathinda with their family members. They were sent to a relief camp. “We are keeping a strict vigil on the migrant labourers as they are walking back to their home towns in Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar and Madhya Pradesh (MP). Walking on road could be dangerous and lead to accidents. We have directed the cops on naka duty to give information about such labourers to the control room or the subdivisional magistrate (SDM), so they can be kept out of harm’s way at shelter homes,” DC Bidhan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mass-migration-of-labourers-sirsa-dc-ssp-review-preparedness/story-0T67ukHCK8s5p5bxDcg2cJ.html
18-05-2020||City||Secondary contacts of Covid-19 patient won’t go under institutional quarantine||Noida: The Uttar Pradesh government has asked all the district magistrates and chief medical officers to follow the upgraded guidelines on primary and secondary contacts of a Covid-19 patient while containing spread of the deadly virus. The new guidelines issued on Saturday give clear instructions on those who should be kept under institutional quarantine and the ones who need to go under home quarantine. UP principal secretary Amit Mohan Prasad has informed officials that people living in the same house as the Covid-19 patient will be kept under institutional quarantine. Anybody who has come in direct and close contact of the patient without wearing personal protection equipment (PPE) kit, then such person also needs to be put under institutional quarantine. “The order has given more clarity on the people who should be kept under home quarantine and the ones who need to go under institutional quarantine. There is more clarity on the action required while handling the primary or the secondary contact of a Covid-19 positive patient,” said a senior health official leading the containment drive in the Gautam Budh Nagar district.The order has made it very clear that any person who has come in contact with the patient within the distance of one metre will be sent to institutional quarantine. This category mostly involves the government and health officials, doctors, nurses, lab technicians and the other paramedical staff, the officials said. All the secondary contacts like neighbours or relatives or colleagues or anybody who comes in indirect contact with the positive patient will be kept under home quarantine until and unless they develop Covid-19 symptoms. The order has also said that it is important to have a separate room in the house for a Covid-19 suspect with an attached bathroom. There has to be more than one bathroom in the house so that the other family members don’t use the one used by the person under home quarantine. There should not be any high risk group in the house before keeping a person under home quarantine like persons above the age of 60, people suffering from co-morbid health conditions, pregnant women and young kids, the guideline said.A person going under home quarantine will have to give a written acceptance that he or she will download the Aarogya Setu application and will be active on that. The concerned persons will have to provide their health updates to the local health officials. Such persons will also have to allow the officials to put a flyer outside their house, it said.The order has also given out guidelines for the family members of the people who are under home quarantine. Officials have suggested that one member should be chosen to provide food and other required items to the suspect to ensure that others don’t come in any contact with that person.Family members are also suggested that they should maintain a minimum distance of two metres at least. Officials have suggested that people living in the same house should use gloves while washing clothes or cleaning the floor. Hands should be washed properly immediately after removing the gloves.If the suspect develops any symptom, then health officials should be informed immediately by the family members, the order said. The order has also said that the washroom and the areas coming in touch with the person under home quarantine should be cleaned and sanitized with 1% of Sodium Hypochlorite. Clothes used by the suspect should be washed with regular detergent and warm water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/secondary-contacts-of-covid-19-patient-won-t-go-under-institutional-quarantine/story-0nG0gVQbskaGV0DJm5ZJ6K.html

18-05-2020||City||Noida: Many migrants unaware of special train facility||Noida: Even as the district administration is busy arranging for special trains to transport stranded migrants to their home towns in Bihar and other districts of Uttar Pradesh, a number of such workers were caught unaware of the facility on Monday.According to officials, at least 8,498 migrants were sent to different destinations in Bihar through seven Shramik special trains from the city till Sunday. However, several migrants claimed that they are not getting ration or food, and no one from the administration ever came to their area to tell about the transport facility.“How would we know about the transportation facility? None of the officials has told us about it. We have been requesting since the lockdown started that either send us home or provide ration,” said Suman Kumar, a migrant worker from Bihar’s Samastipur district who is staying at Shahdara village in Noida Sector 141.Suman who works as electrician said that none of the six families – all migrant workers from Bihar who live in the same rented building – had any clue about the special trains or how to register online for the same. “As far as I know, not a single migrant from Shahdara village has boarded a train. No bus was sent to take us to the railway station,” said Munnu Kumar Singh, a migrant construction worker from Chhapra district in Bihar, who lives in Sector 141.Ranjit Kumar, a native of Mahoba district in Uttar Pradesh, said he came to know about the train services only last week. However, he did not know how to register online for the service. Lucky for him, he got a job on Saturday at a local supermarket. “Last week someone told me that the registration is going on for the trains. But I had no clue, neither did any one of our neighbours. This Saturday, I got a job at a local super market at Rs 6,000 per month. So I’m not leaving Noida now,” said Ranjit, a migrant worker who stays at Gheja village in Noida.According to the officials, they have received over 80,000 registrations from migrant workers and the special trains are being arranged for the same.“Special trains are leaving for Bihar since Saturday. Besides, special trains have been arranged for the workers from eastern UP as well. Today, first lot of migrants, over 4000, were sent to different districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh. Around 84,000 registrations have been received by us and we are arranging trains accordingly,” said Diwakar Singh, additional district magistrate (administration), Gautam Budh Nagar.Migrants who want to go back home can register themselves online through the state government portals jansunawai.up.nic.in or tinyurl.com/pravasi-shramik-UP, the officials said. The other way is to approach different shelter homes where the police help them to get seats on the migrant special trains, they said.“About 800 migrant workers were taken by the police to different shelter homes for screening on Monday, where they will be getting information about the train services. All these migrants either came from Delhi or were found walking on roads. The idea is to get everyone home. The migrants keep coming to the city, so it’s a rolling process,” said Nitin Tiwari, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-many-migrants-unaware-of-special-train-facility/story-jRpq7lRoNHxbUmPWvGKdqO.html
18-05-2020||City||Confusion, chaos as 10,000 migrants try to get on trains back home||Chaos descended at Ghanta Ghar Ramlila Ground on Monday as thousands of migrant workers poured in to get boarding passes for three trains that were bound for Bihar. The Ghaziabad district has been running ‘Shramik Special’ trains to Bihar and east UP since May 15. On Monday three trains were bound to depart for eastern UP towns of Gorakhpur, Varanasi and Prayagraj from Kavi Nagar railway station. Three other trains bound for Muzaffarpur (10am), Raxaul (12 noon) and Patna (1.30pm) were scheduled to depart from Ghanta Ghar.The registration of passengers for Bihar bound trains was being done at Ghanta Ghar, while that of trains leaving for eastern UP cities was being done at Kavi Nagar, Ramlila Ground.“The chaos was primarily due to migrant workers who had managed to cross over from Delhi and other nearby areas. Many came with the hope that documentation for all trains will be done at Ghanta Ghar. We tried our best to control the crowd, but the crowd swelled to around 10,000 people soon,” said Sanjay Kumar, officer on special duty from Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA), who was one of the officers supervising operations at Ghanta Ghar.Official sources said that workers who had not registered online had come to the ground. The crowd swelled when UP Roadways buses brought along more people on Monday morning from shelter homes in Ghaziabad.Workers like Suman Kumar who had come from Chijarsi, Noida, did not manage to get a boarding pass for the train leaving for Patna and was left stranded at Ghanta Ghar, amid the chaos.“I left my room three days ago and have been since trying ti get a train or a bus back to my hometown. But there was no information about any buses or trains. Then someone told that there trains leaving from Ghaziabad station and registrations were being done here. So, i came here on Monday morning and saw that there was a crowd of almost 10,000 people and no social distancing was maintained. They were almost climbing over each other in trying to get a boarding pass,” he added.“I along with 36 of my co-workers came here from Usmanpur in Delhi but could not get a boarding pass for any train due to the huge rush. There was chaos all around. When our turn came for getting documentation completed, the officials told us that the occupancy in trains was full,” said Iftekhar Alam, a migrant worker from Kishanganj in Bihar.A source claimed that the Aarogya Setu app indicated presence of a Covid-19 positive person in the periphery of 500 metres of the Ramlila ground.The officials said that three trains to Bihar were to have occupancy of 1200 passengers each while three trains to UP were to have an occupancy of 900 passengers each.“We were operating six trains and these are catering to all bona fide passengers. There were hardly 400-500 extra people who had come in,” district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey told reporters at Kavi Nagar Ramlila Ground during his inspection on Monday.A group of about 30 to 35 migrant workers, who work at Loha Mandi in Ghaziabad and wanted to go to Chatarpur in Madhya Pradesh, said that they had been doing rounds of Ghanta Ghar and Kavi Nagar in a bid to get information about trains.“It has been two days since and we have been running around to find out about trains leaving for Chatarpur. A child in our group is not well and his mother has been carrying him along in this scorching heat. The police abuse us if they see us on roads,” said Vandana Rajput, one of the migrant workers of the group.SSP Kalanidhi Naitha,i who was at the spot, said, “I will ask my personnel to be more cordial with migrant workers.”Sanket Kumar, who is native of Rae Bareli, said he finally arrived at Kavi Nagar on Monday afternoon from Ahmedabad.“I started four days ago from Gulab Nagar in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, and reached Ghaziabad after taking lifts in trucks. Then I walked on foot to Ghanta Ghar and stood in a long queue. Then, someone finally told me that documentation for trains to UP cities will be done at Kavi Nagar. Then I walked to Kavi Nagar and am trying my luck here now to get a boarding pass,” he added.Though the situation was slightly better at Kavi Nagar, a number of migrants here accused officials of laxity in making proper arrangements. The workers here had gathered since late Sunday night in order to board trains bound for Gorakhpur, Prayagraj and Varanasi at 3pm, 4.30pm and 6.30pm, respectively.“For the past three days we were holed up at a shelter home in Morta. Around 6am on Monday, we were brought to Kavi Nagar by buses but there are no train for our hometown, Bareilly. If there was no train to Bareilly, then why were we brought here and made to sit in the scorching heat? Our children got food only around 2pm,” said Shabana, a migrant worker who had come from Punjab along with her group .“This is utter chaos and no one seems to care. We came to Ghaziabad after a 15-day long journey on foot from Punjab and were taken to shelter home after the group was picked up by police three days ago,” she added.MS Garbyal, additional district magistrate who is supervising operations at Kavi Nagar, said that UP Roadways buses brought workers to the ground on Monday morning.“After the required seats were filled, those left behind will be sent by buses back to shelter homes. They will have to wait for the next trains to their hometowns,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/confusion-chaos-as-10-000-migrants-try-to-get-on-trains-back-home/story-hwL5CTsKvlQU1g5sBZY6qL.html

18-05-2020||Noida||Noida-Delhi border remains sealed even as lockdown 4 eases restrictions||Even as the fourth phase of the nationwide lockdown began from Monday, the Delhi-Noida border continued to remain sealed, permitting only the movement of those involved in essential services and those who had administration-issued passes.However, with the Union ministry of home affairs permitting interstate travel from May 18, traffic chaos was seen at the Kalindi Kunj and Delh-Noida-Direct (DND) Flyway stretch on Monday morning.“People started queuing up on the Delhi side to cross over to Noida, assuming that the borders would have been de-sealed. However, Gautam Budh Nagar is continuing with the previous guidelines and only movement of essential services and those with passes issued by the DM is allowed,” deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Rajesh S said.The district had sealed its border will Delhi in April after several coronavirus disease cases reported in Gautam Budh Nagar were found to have links in Delhi.He said there were snarls in the morning and instead of the usual one lane, traffic personnel had to open two additional lanes to smoothen the flow of traffic. The situation was normalised by 11.30am, traffic officers aid.officers also said the only difference in the fourth phase of the lockdown, which kicked in on May 18 and will continue till May 31, so far was that the movement of medical professionals across state borders have now been allowed.Commuters with date specific passes can only travel on that date while those whose passes were valid only till May 17 will have to renew passes. But the passes permitting the movement of vehicles related to services that have been allowed can continue to ply even in the fourth phase.“The situation was tense Monday morning. There was pressure from the Delhi side but it was controlled. People from Noida who have managed to get across will face problems while returning as rules here have not changed. All previous guidelines are being followed,” Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, said.To ease the situation, the Delhi Police tweeted at 10.43am that people travelling from Delhi to Noida via the Kalindi Kunj barrage or the DND Flyway may face difficulties as entry of only vehicles having passes issued by the district magistrate is allowed.Another tweet at 11.06am issued an advisory that people should avoid crossing the border from these points as traffic was heavy.Commuters faced hour-long snarls due to the additional traffic pressure.“We usually take the Eastern Peripheral Expressway but today, we decided to go via Kalindi Kunj. However, it soon became clear that to cross a 50-metre stretch, it would take us more than an hour and so we then via DND Flyway. It did take us a while but then police opened another lane so the traffic could move more smoothly,” Amrinder Singh, a senior manager with a Noida-based medical equipment managing company, who commutes from Faridabad, said.He said there were many who had come out for no reason and they were being asked by the police to turn back. “The only reason it took so long was because police were verifying each person’s ID and pass. From tomorrow hopefully, the situation will ease,” Singh said.Gautam Budh Nagar administration has not issued any fresh guidelines for the fourth phase of the lockdown. The nationwide lockdown, first announced from March 25, will now continue till May 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-delhi-border-remains-sealed-even-as-lockdown-4-eases-restrictions/story-XN4bO2gpf73FMlw5U2Vd1K.html
18-05-2020||Chandigarh||1991 abduction case: Four Punjab cops seek anticipatory bail||Four policemen, booked along with former Punjab director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini in a case related to the disappearance of Balwant Singh Multani, a Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (CITCO) employee in 1991, moved an anticipatory bail application on Monday. The four are sub-inspectors Har Sahai Sharma, Jagir Singh and Anoop Singh and ASI Kuldip Singh. The court of additional district and sessions judge Monika Goyal is likely to decide on the application on Tuesday. Saini had been granted anticipatory bail last week. In their anticipatory bail plea, the accused have said that after arrest from near the KC Theatre on December 13, 1991, and the recovery of some weapons on Multani’s behest, he was handed over to the Qadian police station from where he had escaped.Opposing the anticipatory bail, district attorney Sanjiv Batra, submitted that Multani was picked up from his house in Phase 7 and produced two witnesses to back his claim. Advocate Pradeep Virk, counsel for the complainant, said Multani’s signatures on the arrest memo were forged. “The signatures do not match and to prove that we have submitted documents from CITCO, where Multani worked,” he added. Earlier in the day, the hearing of arguments on the anticipatory bail plea was delayed, after the prosecution sought transfer of the application, in a verbal submission to additional district and sessions judge, Monika Goyal. They had even met the district sessions judge in this regard, but no written request was made. After a delay of around 30 minutes, arguments were made before the same court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/1991-abduction-case-four-punjab-cops-seek-anticipatory-bail/story-uG178DerIP7M5tjYOGmn9N.html

18-05-2020||Delhi||Man arrested for posting morphed photos of woman on social media||The Delhi Police on Monday said they arrested a 33-year-old cloth merchant from Tughlaqabad Extension for allegedly posting morphed photographs of a woman, who works with a national political party’s IT cell, on social media. The police said the man was attempting to malign the woman’s image, probably because of her political connections. Other persons involved in the crime are also being tracked, senior officers said. The man circulated the posts on Twitter, Facebook and messaging apps, the police said.Delhi Police spokesperson Anil Mittal said the cyber crime unit registered a case under relevant sections of the IT Act after receiving a complaint from a woman alleging that someone had circulated her morphed pictures on social media. The woman told the police that the photographs were obscene. “During the investigation, we found that such posts had been shared with multiple people through social media. We got the posts removed from Facebook and Twitter,” Mittal said.He said that technical surveillance led the police to an account, which had originally shared the obscene posts. The police found that the account details were in the name of one Mohammed Aasim Sayaad, a resident of Tuglakabad Extension, who works as a cloth merchant.“We arrested the man and inspected his mobile phone and computer, which revealed that he had shared the offensive posts on Facebook. He has confessed to his involvement,” Mittal said.Another officer privy to the probe, who wished not to be named, said the probe has suggested that there were many others involved in the crime. “Sayaad is being interrogated to find out on whose directions such pictures were posted on the Internet. Some other account holders who posted the offensive content have also been identified through technical investigation and further probe is underway,” the officer said.The woman said that she is expecting more people to be arrested and that the police must investigate the matter thoroughly. “I had lodged the FIR around two months ago. I think I was targeted because I am holding the flag of my political party in my Twitter profile picture . The same photograph was used, morphed and circulated on almost all social media platforms. It looks like the intention behind this is mainly political,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-arrested-for-posting-morphed-photos-of-woman-on-social-media/story-ey52TjzcYYyMDAGmCcJdgM.html
18-05-2020||Delhi||Thousands gather in Chhatarpur in the hope of returning home||Nearly 5,000 migrants from across the national Capital gathered near Chhatarpur Mandir in south Delhi between Saturday and Monday after news spread that people were being screened there to be sent back home on trains, government officers said. While NGOs and residents arranged meals for the migrants, they struggled to find toilets and spent two nights on the roadside. The district authorities stepped in on Monday to arrange their stay on the Chhatarpur Mandir premises and dharamshalas nearby, with assurances that they would get to board trains to their home towns over the next few days.“Many of the nearly 5,000 migrants who had gathered here have returned to their homes. Over the last couple of days, we have sent around 900 people to their homes in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh by train. Around 2,000 migrants remain here. We have made arrangements for them to stay until we can arrange trains for them,” DM Mishra, district magistrate (south Delhi), said while leading a long queue of migrants to the temple where green and red mats were spread out on floors. Among those left behind on Monday were people who had made multiple failed attempts to get to their home towns, those who had walked here from as far as Bawana and many who got separated from their families . One such man, Kapil Dev, who walked from Bawana to reach Chhatarpur, said that one of his friends had called him on Saturday to inform him of the availability of trains.“I have been waiting here since Saturday night, sleeping on the pavement and hiding behind walls to relieve myself. I am not going to return to Bawana. I tried to leave Delhi on a truck, a bicycle and foot but got caught each time. This might be my last chance,” said Dev, an elderly mechanic who belongs to Darbhanga in Bihar. Mishra said that a lot of these migrants had received SMSs from the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), on whose website they had registered to go back home, to assemble in Chhatarpu. “The word soon spread and over two days, about 5,000 people gathered here,” he said, adding that the numbers were unexpected. While the government could not immediately arrange food for the large gathering, residents stepped in to provide them with meals. “There were no toilets for them. They were sleeping on pavements, in parking lots, and wherever they could find in this heat. We have been arranging food for 1,500 people, but the gathering is much larger than that,” Bhavreen Kandhari, an activist, said.On Monday and Tuesday, several migrants were sent to the New Delhi railway station in DTC buses. Among those left behind were Kanhaiya Lal Das, a mason who wants to return to his village in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur. He had brought along all his belongings in a sack and carried a ceiling fan in his hand.“My house owner wouldn’t let me stay if I didn’t pay rent. So, I packed all my belongings. I don’t think I’ll return to Delhi if I can get back to my village. Whatever little I earn there will be enough for me,” he said. Then there were others who got separated from their families in the melee. “My five-year-old son got separated from us and is in the queue for those being sent by train. Please reunite us with him,” Vipin Kumar, a migrant, urged the district magistrate. Since sending Kumar with his son in a train on Monday was out of the question because of the rush, the DM went looking for the boy until they could be sent home together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/thousands-gather-in-chhatarpur-in-the-hope-of-returning-home/story-Ck9s9pO7WlOm8qogBIJFSK.html
18-05-2020||Chandigarh||Panchkula: 17 buses with 500 migrants leave for Saharanpur||More than 500 migrants, who had left for Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh (UP) from Kalka and Pinjore in 17 special Haryana Roadways buses on May 17 but were sent back, started their journey again on Monday. Kalka subdivisional magistrate (SDM) Rakesh Sandhu said 17 buses from Kalka bus stand and Madanwala village in Pinjore carrying 520 migrants had left on Sunday morning, but were sent back from the Haryana-UP border near Yamunanagar. Raju Yadav, a migrant, who along with his three-year-old son and family, had left in one of the buses from Kalka, said, “It was heartbreaking to see hopes of my family members and many others being shattered within seconds.” The SDM added that after coordinating with their UP counterparts, all migrants were sent back in 17 buses to Saharanpur on Monday morning.However, those who were scheduled to leave for their native places on Monday in special buses from Panchkula were disappointed as their departure was postponed due to the Sunday incident. Officials said they will be now sending migrants back in phased manner instead of daily buses as it was posing difficulties in operations. As per the data obtained from local administration, around 36,000 migrant workers have so far applied to go back to other states.20 BUSES DEPART FROM AMBALA A day after 20 buses ferrying migrant workers were pulled back from Yamunanagar, the district administration sent these towards Saharanpur again on Monday.The Haryana Roadways buses ferrying nearly 600 migrants, with 30 of them in each bus, left from Radha Soami Satsang Bhawan on Jalbera Road here.Deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma said they we are sending only those migrant workers to their home districts who have registered under e-Disha.“We are regularly sending migrant workers registered on e-Disha through buses and trains. Around 3,700 agricultural labourers have been sent to Bhagalpur, Katihar and Muzaffarpur in Bihar via three special trains. Buses ferrying migrants are also being sent to UP.”(With inputs by Bhavey Nagpal from Ambala)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panchkula-17-buses-with-500-migrants-leave-for-saharanpur/story-mgs7YkFUcGZ2nvDHtXVJ4I.html
18-05-2020||Chandigarh||22-year-old youth shot dead over land dispute in Tarn Taran; nine booked||A 22-year-old man was shot dead over a land dispute in Maluwal village, 15 km from the district headquarter, on Sunday night. The deceased has been identified as Harkirat Singh of the same village. Police have also booked nine persons, including six by name — Karaj Singh, his wife Ranjit Kaur, Harjit Kaur, Ranjit Kaur (namesake of Karaj’s wife) of Maluwal village, and Rashpal Singh of Bhuchar village, and a migrant labourer Raju. Police, however, are yet to make an arrest.The case was registered on the complaint of the deceased’s father Navjot Singh (45). He said, “We had a written agreement with Karaj Singh to sell our 6.5 acres of agriculture land in the village in 2016. Karaj had been increasing the date of registration of the land and due to this, we had given our land to Karaj on contract-basis. However, neither Karaj had been getting the land’s registration done nor he had been giving us the land’s rent. Karaj had sown wheat on the land and we had been resisting its harvesting. Karaj, however, harvested the crop on Saturday.”He said, “On Sunday, my brother Upkar Singh, my elder son Harkirat Singh and my wife Manjit Kaur had gone to see our fields. In the meantime, the accused also reached the spot in a Mahindra Bolero SUV. Karaj had a .12 bore riffle while Rashpal had a pistol. Karaj opened fire from his riffle. One of the shots hit my son and he succumbed to the injuries.”Chabhal station house officer (SHO) Harwinder Singh said they have registered a case under sections 302 (murder), 506 (criminal intimidation), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian penal code (IPC) and section 25-27 of the Arms Act against the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/22-year-old-youth-shot-dead-over-land-dispute-in-tarn-taran-nine-booked/story-K9k8LDYOsmbr2D7CK0XTZM.html

18-05-2020||Chandigarh||All rural households to get potable water by 2022: Amarinder||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday said the state was all set to provide 100% potable piped water connections to all rural households by 2022. He added that 50% of these households already had individual water connections.In a video conference with Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, the CM said as of April 1, 2020, of the 1,634 habitations in which ground water was impacted, 477 had been provided potable water, and the state was committed to covering all rural households with piped water supply connections by March 2022, in line with the target of the Punjab government even before the conceptualisation of Jal Jiwan Mission (JJM) by the Centre.To further boost the state’s efforts, the CM sought reduction in GST on treatment plans as well as purification media from the current 18% to 5%, to make JJM schemes sustainable in the long run. He pointed out that media in the water treatment plan needed to be replaced every 2-3 years.Amarinder urged the Union minister to recognise the 1,449 Kandi belt villages as ‘hill area’ to reduce the beneficiary contribution from 10% to 5% for construction under JJM. He said the state government had been repeatedly raising the subject with the Centre for the past two years, but no action had been taken yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/all-rural-households-to-get-potable-water-by-2022-amarinder/story-u34eKQBDQ23zPMZMYM4DjM.html
18-05-2020||Chandigarh||Tomato growers of Haryana see red as prices crash to ₹3/kg||Tomato growers in the region are staring at huge losses as the wholesale prices have crashed drastically to ₹3 per kg amid the lack of buyers.“Today, I sold tomato at ₹60 per crate (containing 22-24kg) to the local traders as no buyers from Delhi are coming to our area due to the lack of demand amid Covid-19 lockdown,” said Ajay Kumar, a young farmer from Ladwa in Kurukshetra district.Moreover, the tomato growers have predicted further drop in rates as it is just the beginning of harvesting, which will be at its peak in the next two weeks.Worried, the farmers have started dumping their harvest stating that the prices do not even cover the charges of transporting the crop to Delhi or any other big vegetable markets.“A crate of tomato is being sold at ₹80 in Delhi, but transporting one will cost ₹40. This will incur a profit of only ₹40 for 22kg of tomato,” said Om Prakash, a farmer from Dhanokheri of Karnal district.Haryana horticulture department director general Arjun Singh Saini said, “To protect farmers from losses, the government has extended the deadline of registration under the Bhavantar Bharpai Scheme, which assures prices of ₹5/kg.”However, farmer Mahinder Singh from Yamunanagar said, “The government’s support is not sufficient as ₹5/kg price for 140 quintals does not cover even the input cost, which is around ₹70,000/acre.”Ram Kumar from Bhiwani’s Kharkhari Makhwan village said, “Even with compensation of ₹1/kg, I will bear a loss of ₹60,000/acre. So, I have dumped my produce in the field, allowing cattle to graze on it.” He and with 50 other farmers from his village have been sitting on a dharna since May 15 demanding hike in the minimum support price of tomato.Bhiwani deputy commissioner Ajay Kumar said he will raise the issue with senior officials.ABHAY CHAUTALA MEETS PROTESTING FARMERSEllenabad MLA and INLD general secretary Abhay Singh Chautala on Monday met the protesting farmers in Bhiwani. He alleged that they were forced to dump crop due to government’s poor policies.“They should be given compensation of ₹60,000/acre. If the state fails to do this, the grief-stricken farmers will shift towards old crops, which are not profitable. I will raise this issue with the chief minister and officials concerned,” Abhay said.Haryana agriculture minister JP Dalal could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/tomato-growers-of-haryana-see-red-as-prices-crash-to-3-kg/story-y0zVj7lM3PyZAcWbaKrRnL.html

The department also recovered 564 litre of lahan (raw material used to distill liquor) from villages on the banks of the Ghaggar river. Based on these raids, 13 FIRs have been registered in police stations across the district. A few days ago, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had directed the police to crackdown on all kinds of liquor smuggling, bootlegging and illicit distillation of liquor to protect the cash-strapped state from incurring any revenue losses.SSP Mandeep Singh Sidhu said the raids would continue. “Deputy commissioner Kumar Amit held a meeting on Monday and passed orders to check all those premises where liquor smuggling is suspected to be taking place,” the SSP said, adding DSPs and SHOs had been directed to submit a daily report to district headquarters. Officers violating these orders would face strict action. On May 16, an illegal distillery-cum-liquor-bottling plant was busted in Ghanaur , after which a Congress sarpanch and a local MLA’s aide were booked.

The SGPC also used to extend financial aid to the needy on request, which has now been suspended for three months.The executive committee also gave approval to setting up of high-powered committee to look into the fiscal crisis and come out with some guidelines. It will comprise SGPC senior vice-president Rajinder Singh Mehta, junior vice-president Gurbaksh Singh, general secretary Harjinder Singh Dhami, chief secretary Roop Singh and academicians. It will submit its report in 10 days.“This committee will look into the financial matters pertaining to various SGPC departments, including dharam parchar, management of gurdwaras and educational institutes,” said president Gobind Singh Longowal, who chaired the meeting.However, the panel did not touch the salaries being given to thousands of the SGPC employees amid the fiscal crisis. When asked, a SGPC official said, “The committee will discuss about it.”‘Will approach Centre for including Amritsar in expressway project’Taking serious note of the exclusion of Amritsar from the much-hyped Delhi-Amritsar-Katra Expressway Project, the SGPC executive also passed a resolution condemning the move and decided to raise the concern with the Union government.“This is very unfortunate to exclude Guru Nagari from the ₹60,000 crore project. The project should be executed as per its original alignment according to which Amritsar was its part. The SGPC will take up the matter with Union home minister Amit Shah and Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari,” said Longowal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sgpc-stops-3-lakh-discretionary-fund-to-members-this-year/story-K1IKSIQQEpFkG3l63J9HrK.html
18-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab can borrow ₹12,000 cr more, but govt not enthused||The Centre’s decision to raise borrowing limits for states from 3% to 5% of gross state domestic product (GSDP) for 2020-21 will allow the Punjab government a headroom of ₹12,000 crore in the current fiscal.The state government had pegged its borrowing from the market at ₹18,827 crore during the current financial year and the enhancement in the limit under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act will allow it access to extra funds to meet the shortfall in revenues due to the Covid-19 outbreak, according to senior officials.While the state will be able to borrow additional ₹3,000, or say 0.5% of the enhanced FRBM limit, straightaway from the market, the rest is linked to reforms in four areas – universalisation of ‘one nation, one ration card’, ease of doing business, power distribution and achieving an increase in the revenues of the urban local bodies.Of the enhanced borrowing limit, 1% — four tranches of 0.25% — is linked to clearly specified reform actions and a further 0.5% hike will be granted if milestones are achieved in at least three out of the four reform areas. “The state (Punjab) has already integrated with the ‘one nation, one ration card’ system and is progressing well on ease of doing well and power distribution reforms. The public policy reforms-linked enhancement in the FRBM limit is per se a good step, but it is just additional borrowing limit without no relief or support in interest, and not a stimulus or grant. We were expecting more revenue deficit grant from the Centre as a stimulus to combat Covid-19,” said a senior official who did not want to be named.The debt-stressed state government, whose tax revenues got severely hit due to the coronavirus-induced national lockdown, had requested the Centre to relax the borrowing limit from 3 per cent to 4 per cent of GSDP, but has been circumspect in market borrowings so far. The state finance department has borrowed ₹2,600 crore by way of government securities in the first six weeks of the current financial year. “There is a full year ahead and no one knows how things will pan out from here. The market borrowings will depend entirely on cash flows or debt repayment schedule,” he said.Punjab is already among the most indebted states with a debt-gross state domestic product ratio of 40%. At ₹2.29 lakh crore as on March 31, 2020, the rising debt is seen as one of the major causes of the state’s fiscal woes. The state government had shelled out around ₹17,600 crore as interest payments during the previous fiscal. These borrowings have been going into debt servicing or meeting day-to-day expenditure, and not in the creation of income-generating capital assets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-can-borrow-12-000-cr-more-but-govt-not-enthused/story-Qwmtf4qPRJ1OhXZuzC14mO.html
18-05-2020||City||Untreated sewage continues to flow in drains, Fazilka admn misses NGT deadline||The nationwide lockdown to curb spread of coronavirus has scaled up troubles for Fazilka residents as the discharge of untreated sewage has soared significantly.The state monitoring panel of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has asked the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) authorities to take immediate measures to control the hazardous practice of discharging untreated municipal waste into the drainage networks.NGT Punjab panel head justice Jasbir Singh (retd) confirmed on Monday that the field inputs show that the in-situ bioremediation of sewage by urban local bodies (ULBs) in different districts of the Malwa region is still incomplete.Bioremediation is the use of naturally-occurring or deliberately-introduced microorganisms to consume and break down environmental pollutants.“In January this year, 18 ULBs of the five Malwa districts of Fazilka, Ferozepur, Muktsar, Moga and Faridkot were directed to adopt bioremediation of sewage by March 31. Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown, the ULBs missed the deadline and untreated sewage continues to flow in the drains. This may prove to be hazardous to heath. Today, I have telephonically discussed the matter with the PPCB officials,” he said.Singh said that PPCB authorities were duly informed through email on Saturday about the inflow of untreated sewage in drains of Fazilka.“The PPCB officials have been asked to expedite work of treating municipal waste as now relaxations have been granted by the state government to resume development works. A virtual meeting has been fixed for Thursday to discuss the environmental issues,” he added.At a meeting held in Fazilka on January 7, the NGT state panel had directed the ULBs to start bioremediation by March-end. Failing which, the municipalities would be liable for a penalty of Rs 5 lakh. Singh said no decision of imposing fine has been taken as the delay was due to lockdown.Vikram Ahuja, a farm rights activist from Fazilka, had filed a petition in the NGT in July last year stating that untreated sewage of 21 municipalities of Punjab’s Malwa belt is flowing through drains into the district resulting in contamination of groundwater.

Karan Avtar Singh was accompanied by additional chief secretary (home) Satish Chandra and additional chief secretary (governance reforms and public grievances) Vinni Mahajan.The call to boycott the chief secretary by the ministers was given on May 11 by passing a resolution, after the officer had a spat with three senior ministers — Manpreet Singh Badal (finance), Charanjit Channi (technical education) and Sukhjinder Randhawa (jails and cooperation) over the issue of state excise policy.To avoid an embarrassment, the government had appointed Satish Chandra as cabinet secretary of the meeting of the council of ministers on May 11. The next day, Karan Avtar was relieved of the charge of finance commissioner (taxation) by the state government.This was followed by a strong demand by Congress’ Gidderbaha MLA Amrinder Singh Raja Warring to remove Karan Avtar as chief secretary, with many ruling party MLAs supporting him. Warring even had levelled allegation of conflict of interest against the officer.The ministers who attended Monday’s meeting said they didn’t have any issue with the chief secretary being part of it.“There was no point of boycotting the meeting chaired by the CM himself. The issue has already caused a lot of embarrassment to the state government,” a minister, who wished not to be quoted, said. “We should leave the issue to the CM,” another minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-ministers-split-over-boycotting-chief-secy-3-attend-conference-with-him/story-Ow2f3Ys84iy4NsjKXsCXYP.html
18-05-2020||Gurugram||No Metro or Gurugam buses till May 31, bike-taxi services resume||The fourth phase of the ongoing nationwide lockdown will continue in Gurugram with largely the same curbs on mobility that were enforced in the third phase, said government officials who also clarified that mass transit facilities — including Gurugram’s city bus service, Rapid Metro Link, and Delhi’s Metro’s Yellow Line — will remain suspended in the city till May 31 as per the guidelines laid down by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA).A senior official aware of the developments said, “We did give some thoughts about resuming operations of the Rapid Metro since it runs only within the city, but all metro rail services across India are to remain shut. We may consider resuming operations after May 31.” Autorickshaws have also not yet been permitted to ply within the district so far. “Until now, there has been no official state order allowing autorickshaws to ply, even though as per MHA guidelines they are allowed to run in ‘orange zones,’” Yogesh Sharma, head, Gurugram-based Haryana Auto Chalak Sangathan, said. “Only those autos affiliated with private cab aggregators have resumed operations so far, and those working independently are waiting for state orders to be issued,” he added. In a new addition, app-based cab operators on Monday resumed bike-taxi services in Gurugram, which remains classified as an ‘orange zone.’ Residents on Monday were able to book bike-taxis to various locations within the city via both Ola and Uber apps. Representatives from the two companies declined to comment and said they were waiting for official orders from the Haryana government before giving a statement. Meanwhile, private cabs and vehicles will be allowed to ply in Gurugram with not more than two passengers and a driver, as was the case earlier.VS Kundu, additional chief secretary to the Haryana government and nodal officer for monitoring Covid-19 efforts in Gurugram, said, “There will be no change in the previous rules for now. Private cab aggregators will continue to ply, but given the recent surge in cases, maintaining social distancing is still the need of the hour. The city-bus service and Rapid Metro will remain closed for the time being. The state government will issue further clarification on inter-district and inter-state movement.” In a video statement released on Twitter on Monday evening, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that both intra-state and inter-state bus services will resume in the state from Tuesday. Last week, Haryana Roadways had already started operating buses on select routes between 10 districts in Haryana and bus service with certain restrictions in other districts is expected to start soon.However, no buses will run between Delhi and Gurugram, and Faridabad, and only people with passes will be allowed to move across the Delhi-Gurugram border. District authorities are yet to issue guidelines on whether buses would be allowed to run between Gurugram and Faridabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/no-metro-or-gurugam-buses-till-may-31-bike-taxi-services-resume/story-VWH4Ihdj4gvmEpaRW9jKpJ.html
18-05-2020||Gurugram||One killed, another injured in open firing||A group of unidentified men on Monday morning allegedly opened fired at two men, both with criminal records, who were travelling in a car in Taj Nagar village in Farrukhnagar. The police said that one of the men sustained gunshot injury on his head and died at the spot, while the other sustained injuries on his hand and is currently undergoing treatment at a hospital. A preliminary probe into the matter suggests that the reason behind the incident was a financial dispute between one of the two victims and his business partner, who is the prime accused in the case.According to the police, the victims were identified by their first names as Ravinder alias Sarkar, 31, from Taj Nagar village and Yashpal, 21, from Joniawas village. Ravinder and the prime accused in this case, Birender alias Kallu, were accused in the murder case of one Mahendra Singh, who was the sarpanch of Taj Nagar village. The incident had taken place in March 2011 and both Ravinder and Birender got out of jail on bail in 2016, after which they started business together. The police said that both the men are involved in nine criminal cases each and Yashpal, the deceased, was involved in three criminal cases.According to the police, on Monday morning, Ravinder and Yashpal, were travelling in their Maruti Suzuki Swift car in Taj Nagar village when some unidentified men came in a car and fired gunshots at them.Rajesh Singh, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Manesar, said, “Yashpal sustained a fatal gunshot injury on his head and died at the spot. Ravinder sustained at least three gunshot injuries on his hand. His condition is reported to be stable and he is undergoing treatment at a hospital.”A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said that Ravinder and Birender were partners in multiple business ventures, including real estate. “Due to the lockdown there were issues of cash flow and a financial dispute emerged between them. A preliminary probe suggests that this was the main reason behind the murder. We have booked Birender and three other persons, including a woman in the case. They are yet to be arrested. We are investigating the matter,” the official said.A case was registered against the accused under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 120b (criminal conspiracy) and 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Arms Act at Farrukhnagar police station on Monday.In another incident, a 40-year-old man was arrested on Sunday for allegedly murdering a man with an iron rod after an argument at a construction site in Sector 90.The arrested man was identified as Mohammed Shaukat, who is a native of Bihar. The police said that he and the victim, Mangaldas, worked as masons at the construction site and were living there with other masons. Sanjay, station house officer (SHO), Sector 10 police station, said that on Saturday around 9.30 pm, the victim returned to the construction site in an inebriated condition. “The victim was misbehaving with other workers at the site. Shaukat, who was present at the spot, hit him with an iron road on his leg in order to scare him. However, the injury was severe and the victim died in the hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/one-killed-another-injured-in-open-firing/story-eQY6xFoCubNZzzm5DdNnVL.html
18-05-2020||Gurugram||Economic activities to resume, restrictions at Delhi-Ggm border to stay||As the nationwide lockdown entered its fourth phase on Monday with considerable relaxations, all areas in Haryana except for containment zones would be classified as ‘orange zones’ where all economic activities permitted by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) will be allowed, the state government said on Tuesday.

The Haryana government, however, did not issue any fresh set of guidelines or a detailed notification customising the directives issued by the MHA on Sunday. A spokesperson of Gurugram district administration said the curbs on movement in the city will remain same as before as Gurugram was an ‘orange zone’ already. “Until new guidelines or a fresh notification is issued, the situation will remain the same in Gurugram,” he said. The nationwide lockdown has been extended till May 31.The CM, however, expressed concern that four districts in Haryana—Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonipat and Jhajjar—which border Delhi were a cause of concern due to their high number of Covid-19 cases. The CM said because of the high number of cases, strict restrictions on the movement of people from Delhi into Haryana will continue.“Entry of people from Delhi or Noida will remain restricted and only those people who have passes issued by the authorities will be allowed entry. Several government departments, private institutions and hospitals have given us a list of employees to whom passes have been issued,” Khattar said adding that the main focus was to stop the spread of coronavirus.However, as of Monday night (around 10 pm), the online portal to reserve tickets for Haryana Roadways buses (which is mandatory for bookings) offered options for booking bus journeys from Delhi to certain districts which do not share their border with the national capital. Tickets were available for travelling between Delhi and Hisar, Fatehabad, Panchkula, Narnaul, Kaithal, Palwal, Sirsa, Bhiwani, and Ambala on May 19.As per directions issued by the district administration, a person who lives in Delhi but works in Gurugram will have to get a pass from authorities in Delhi. In case, residents of Gurugram want to travel for work in Delhi will have to apply for a weekly pass on the Saral Haryana portal. A person who lives in Noida and works in Gurugram will have to get a pass from the Uttar Pradesh government, which shall be honoured by authorities in Haryana. The district administration also assured that passes issued to health workers shall be given priority and they will be assisted in this matter by officials concerned.To ensure economic activities resume in the state, CM Khattar said that large industrial areas outside containment zones in Gurugram and Faridabad will be allowed to resume industrial and commercial activities under in the fourth phase on the lockdown. “Restrictions will remain in containment zones, but in areas such as IMT Manesar industry owners can resume operations but with strict social distancing norms,” he said.As per the MHA guidelines, the movement of people in and out of containment zones is restricted. except for medical emergencies or when in need of essential items. No economic activities are allowed in these zones.The restriction on the number of employees that a commercial or industrial unit can employ during lockdown has also been done away with. “There is no restriction on the number of employees in Haryana now as MHA has done away with it,” he said. Referring to the impending summer season, the CM said that directions have been issued to ensure that the electricity supply in the state is regular. “We held a review meeting with the power department and asked officials to ensure regular electricity supply,” said Khattar. The state government has also given directions to issue 5,000 tube-well connections, and complaints regarding excess or wrong electricity bills are looked into.“Consumers can call at helpline number 1912 to rectify the bills,” he said.

18-05-2020||Gurugram||Hundreds without movement passes turned away at border||Traffic congestion was witnessed at the Delhi-Gurugram border on Wednesday morning as the city police continued to restrict the entry of people without a movement pass. On the first day of the fourth phase of the lockdown, several office-goers could not reach their offices and were turned away as they did not have the requisite pass. They said they were hoping for relaxation in curbs so they could gain passage to the city.Earlier in the first week of May, the police had changed the layout of deployment at the Sirhaul border by placing barricades 100 metres before the border to ensure smoother movement of vehicles.The police said that since they had to barricade several lanes to check for movement passes, vehicles were permitted to use only two lanes, which led to congestion over 100 metres long at the border between 8am and 9am. At least two policemen deputed at the Sirhaul border said that they had to turn away about 500 motorcyclists and 50 car owners as they failed to show them the requisite documents.The authorities sealed the borders connecting the two states in the last week of April and allowed only those engaged in essential services with valid passes to enter. Two weeks later, the administration permitted medical professionals, health care professionals and people associated with emergency services to cross the border without a movement pass.A police officer, requesting anonymity, said, “Many office employees said that they had assumed that restrictions on the interstate movement of passenger vehicles had been lifted, referring to an MHA order. However, we have not received any new guidelines. Only people who have the movement pass will be allowed to enter.”Rajesh Kumar, a Delhi resident, who works in Udyog Vihar, said, “I have been at home since the lockdown was announced in March. I heard yesterday that the government had allowed interstate commute. So, I decided to go to the office, hoping that the police would allow me through after checking my identity card. There is a lot of confusion and the police told me that a daily movement pass is still mandatory.”Ashok Yadav, who runs a taxi business, said, “I provide taxis to several offices in the city. The offices, which employ our services, have resumed operations, but most of the drivers stay in Delhi. Several of them were turned back today morning. Now, I have been asked to submit a list of their names and get daily movement passes made for them.”A senior traffic police officer, requesting anonymity, said that the traffic was cleared within 45 minutes. “A small queue had formed while checking for movement passes, which was cleared soon,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hundreds-without-movement-passes-turned-away-at-border/story-Mdb0yEozmc1zvmgzkj55UK.html
18-05-2020||Gurugram||Supervised movement, travel history documentation for domestic helpers returning to work||As the lockdown entered its fourth phase on Monday with considerable restrictions in non-containment zones, more condominiums are allowing the entry of domestic workers such as helpers, cooks and drivers. While some condominiums have asked residents to call domestic helpers on alternate days, others are accepting requests from only those keen on letting domestic helpers resume work in their households. At several places, people pushing for calling domestic helpers home are required to furnish information such as travel and health history of the domestic workers before they are allowed into the society premises to resume work.At Fresco Apartments in Nirvana Country, residents seeking the services of domestic workers are required to fill a request form with information such as name, contact, addresses, travel and health history of the worker and the worker’s family. Once the request is approved, the name of the worker is added to a list against which the guard makes enquiries on a daily basis before a worker is let inside the condominium. After corroborating the details of the worker with the list, residents are required to come down and escort them to the respective flat. Workers are not allowed to travel alone in the lift. Similarly, residents are required to escort workers while leaving the flat. “We started allowing domestic helpers to come in from today (Monday). Residents who were interested in letting domestic helpers work were asked to fill a Google form and make certain declarations following which entry of domestic workers was allowed,” said Nilesh Tandon, president of the condominium’s resident welfare association (RWA). The Retreat in South City-1 had allowed domestic helpers to work for senior citizens in the third phase of the lockdown even as only five or six residents opted for the choice. With the start of the fourth phase of the lockdown, the condominium has offered further relaxation and left it to the residents to call domestic helpers. “Not all residents, especially those with younger children, are open to the idea of letting domestic helpers work. However, for those who want the domestic helpers to work in their house, we have shared a three-page document seeking information about the workers,” said Abha Sharma, member of the condominium’s management committee. Residents are supposed to provide information about the health history, travel history of the domestic help, and confirm if the latter are coming from containment zones or not. Once the form is filled, it is submitted at the estate office that scrutinises the forms along with the security office. So far, around 30 people have filled these forms, said Sharma. Domestic helpers who have a smartphone have also been requested to download Aarogya Setu mobile app. “Residents are responsible for the health of domestic helpers and have been asked to provide them with masks, sanitisers and other protective equipment,” said Sharma.At DLF Westend Heights in Phase 5, domestic helps and cooks were allowed to enter the condominium on alternate days from Monday. Car cleaners and drivers, meanwhile, are allowed to come in daily but cannot enter the lobby or use the lift. The responsibility of verifying the travel and health history of the domestic helpers has been left up to the residents. “We are using a web application through which domestic helps are required to make an entry or mark their entry on a register. Domestic helps can come on alternate days. We are not sure what exact purpose this mechanism will serve though,” said Ritu Bhariok, a resident.As many as 70 domestic helper joined work at Princeton Estate on Monday, even as the RWA awaits guidelines from the district administration. “We have allowed domestic helpers to work from today, but we will only issue an advisory to residents once we remain specific district orders on domestic workers,” said Satish Nangia, RWA president of Princeton Estate. Nangia said the complex now has a separate lift for domestic workers to satisfthose residents who were do not want domestic helpers to work in the society. “We are advising those employing domestic helpers to ensure that all workers do not stand in close proximity to each other in the society. We are also recording the movement of each domestic worker, in case such a database needs to be looked into the future,” said Nangia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/supervised-movement-travel-history-documentation-for-domestic-helpers-returning-to-work/story-acn2R3sqpBy4ozg53GPfnO.html
18-05-2020||Gurugram||To seek appointment or lodge complaint, just send email to DTCP||In a bid to ensure that social distancing norms are followed and development work does not suffer, the department of town and country planning (DTCP) has created different email IDs to seek appointments, lodge complaints and get information on building plans, among other issues. DTCP officials said that the emails sent to them would elicit response within 24 hours and a dedicated team would be monitoring the communication with applicants.The department said on Monday that emails for pending permissions can be sent to pendingpermissiondtpe@gmail.com. Similarly, to lodge complaints and check their status, emails can be sent to complaintsdtpe@gmail.com, while to seek appointments, the mails should be sent to appointmentsdtpe@gmail.com. RS Bhath, district town planner, said that the purpose of these email IDs is to ensure office work is carried out smoothly and by maintaining the social distancing norms. “The objective now is to use online tools, so that people have minimal need to visit the DTP office. Meetings should be held on basis of prior appointments to avoid crowding,” he said. The department has also taken similar steps for the enforcement wing and complaints can be lodged online through the email ID shared with people.The department also said that it has come to its notice that construction work in violation of norms is being carried out in some parts of the city, which shall not be allowed. “We have issued a notice to a resident of Sector 104 for constructing an unauthorized room and a boundary wall in the revenue estate of village Gurgaon. It was also found that the said land is earmarked for construction of 24-metre road. Similar violations have been reported earlier also and these shall not be allowed to continue,” said Bhath.The officials said that they are particularly concerned over illegal construction on land earmarked for 24-metre roads as these are necessary for licensed colonies to get access to master roads as per the sectoral plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/to-seek-appointment-or-lodge-complaint-just-send-email-to-dtcp/story-wSX7UIuUSemXZUdY0VVGZN.html
18-05-2020||Gurugram||Migrant worker kills self after landlord forces him to pay rent||A 45-year-old migrant worker died after allegedly consuming poison at his rented room in Sector 11 early Sunday morning. The police said that a suicide note was recovered from the spot in which the migrant worker alleged that his landlord was harassing him for the rent. In the police complaint, his neighbour also alleged that his landlord was forcibly demanding rent from him. The landlord was later booked by the police for abetment to suicide. The police said that the migrant worker’s family members, who stay in Odisha, have refused to collect his body as they are in a containment zone.According to the police, the deceased man worked as a plumber in Gurugram and lived by himself. On Sunday, around 6am, his neighbour, who stays in the same building, came to his room to wake him up.The neighbour stated in the police complaint, “Around 6 am, I went to his room to wake him up. I kept knocking on his door but he did not open it. I got suspicious and then asked our landlord, who stays on the ground floor, to come over and check. When there was still no answer, we called the police helpline number and broke into the room.” He added that the deceased man’s body was lying on the floor and there was an empty packet of poison next to it. “Two days ago, he (the victim) had told me that the landlord was troubling him and forcibly demanding rent from him. He was stressed and killed himself by consuming poison,” the complainant stated in the FIR.Ajit, assistant sub-inspector (ASI), Shivaji Nagar police station, said that the deceased man would pay around ₹6,000 as rent. “The preliminary probe suggests that the victim owed around ₹30,000 to his landlord as rent. He was a plumber and was not able to get work because of the lockdown. We have registered a case against the landlord and he is yet to be arrested. We are investigating the matter.”A case was registered against the landlord under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Shivaji Nagar police station on Sunday.In April, the Haryana Government had issued directions stating that landlords should not demand house rent for a month from migrant workers, students and paramedics in rural areas of the state. In the order, the authorities had said that if any landlord was found forcing such tenants to vacate, they would be liable to face strict criminal action. On March 29, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had issued an order asking landlords to stop demanding rent from students, workers and migrant labourers for a month.Despite the measures taken, tenants continue to face harassment from the landlords with repeated warnings. In April, at least seven landlords were arrested and booked for forcibly demanding rent from tenants in the city. The police said that they have kept the deceased man’s body in the mortuary and have contacted his family. However, they have refused to come to Gurugram and collect the body.“The man’s relatives said that he had run away from home around 30 years ago. Since then they have rarely talked to each other. On Sunday, when we informed them about the incident, the relatives said that they can’t afford to come to Gurugram,” the ASI said.The man’s relatives alleged that he had called them on April 3 and informed them that he was having financial issues and was not able to pay rent.“He rarely called us. The last time he came to visit us was 10 years ago after he met with an accident. He did not even come for his father’s funeral. Recently, he called us and said that he wanted to come home as he was facing financial issues. We told him that he could come, but would have to stay in quarantine for 14 days as Gurugram and Delhi have a large number of Covid-19 cases. We can’t come to collect his body as we are living in a containment zone and do not have enough money for the travel,” one of his relatives said on the phone. He added that they are trying to trace his wife and children and would ask them to collect the body.“The man had informed his family that he was married and had children. But the relatives said that they never got an opportunity to talk to them and have no information about them.

The aim is to ensure uninterrupted health services to the public in Punjab at their doorsteps in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Kumar Bagga said, “Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu has directed the platform to extend its specialised healthcare services to the masses in rural areas and isolated community pockets as well.”He said e-Sanjeevani provides a platform for citizens to connect with a network of specialist doctors over video conferencing and obtain medical treatment and advice for common health-related issues from home.Dr Bagga said, “Besides telemedicine services in health and wellness centres, the health & family welfare department, with active support from the governance reforms and public grievances departments, has also implemented this programme across the state.”The salient features of e-Sanjeevani OPD include patient registration, token generation, queue management, audio-video consultation with a doctor, e-prescription, SMS/email notifications, services of the state’s doctors (from the department of health & family welfare), free service, fully configurable (number of daily slots, doctors/clinics, waiting room slots, consultation time limits, etc). The application also has an advanced degree of security against unwanted elements.Dr Bagga added, “To keep the operations smoother at the district level, the department of governance reforms and public grievances has deputed district technical coordinators (DTCs) or district e-governance coordinators (DeGCs) from each district to assist the teams of doctors at the district level.”He said doctors in Punjab have been using the e-Sanjeevani (doctor to doctor) system for over a decade now, hence they would not take much time to adopt the e-Sanjeevani platform as well.The platform has an extremely user-friendly interface, which facilitates both tech-savvy and relatively novice doctors/users in the rural and urban environment to access the application, Dr Bagga said.He said to avail the benefits of “e-sanjeevani-opd”, a patient/person should have a computer, laptop or tablet (tab) along with a separate or inbuilt webcam, microphone, speakers and access to a 2mbps or faster internet connection (LAN/WiFi).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/government-extends-c-dac-e-sanjeevani-opd-platform-to-rural-areas-ludhiana-civil-surgeon/story-lilyUgJme05qZ4LJCK8VRL.html

Besides, the health department has been asked to shift 40 other patients at the shelter, who are high-risk contacts, to be put under hospital care.The Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) shelter no.148 has around 98 occupants, of which 40 are patients who will be put under in-situ quarantine.“The two who tested positive are kidney patients and used to go for dialysis. We have informed the health department to shift other 40 patients with co-morbidities, who are at a greater risk of contracting infection to be shifted to hospitals for immediate care,” said Mishra. One of the shelter caretakers, who did not wish to be named, said that the two patients belonged to Gwalior (MP) and Jhansi (UP), respectively. The occupants are at risk because all of them share the common toilet facility. “The two used to go for dialysis at a private facility, which had asked them to get their Covid tests done. Many patients from the shelter had already left for their native places over the past weeks, otherwise it would have been a bigger risk,” he said.Sunil Kumar Aledia, a social activist, who works for the homeless, said that in such cases the district authorities must conduct Covid tests for the caretakers as well as all the occupants, as they share common facilities and run a high risk of contracting the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kidney-patients-test-positive-at-shelter-near-aiims/story-gNQXJF54IvJ2ifwKYWxstO.html

18-05-2020||Lucknow||With ‘clean politics’, political parties in UP lay stress on Covid-19 shield||The term ‘clean politics’ has acquired a new meaning in these coronavirus-afflicted times. Political parties have started putting in place a mechanism that reflects increasing consciousness among them about the need to continue with Covid safety protocols in their offices even when the lockdown, which has been extended till May 31, ends.Already, seating arrangements are being reworked at the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) office in Uttar Pradesh. A sanitation or disinfectant tunnel is the latest addition to the BJP office through which all entrants would have to pass. Automated sanitiser machine with sensors at various places in the party office is an added novelty. A mask vending machine is also in place at the party office to help those walking in without a face cover. Wearing a mask or face cover has been made mandatory in the state. Violation of this norm would lead to a fine ranging from Rs 100 to Rs 1000. “All entrants would be subjected to a thermal scan,” UP BJP general secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak said.The state government has banned large public gatherings in Uttar Pradesh till June 30. During the lockdown, the BJP has been relying on technology to connect with its cadres and functionaries over an online platform. Its state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal has been operating from the party office while state chief Swatantra Dev Singh has been connecting with cadres from home.BJP state general secretaries Govind Narayan Shukla and Vijay Bahadur Pathak, who were seen entering the party office and passing through the disinfectant tunnel, said the party was preparing for the post lockdown phase.“As a responsible political party, we are putting in place a seating arrangement which would ensure that even post lockdown we follow social distancing during work,” said the BJP’s Manish Dixit.Outside the Congress office, workers were seen providing sanitisers to everyone entering the office. “We have got sanitisers and masks at our party office. In fact, our leader Priyanka Gandhi has sent one lakh masks for cadre and commoners alike,” said Congress’s Lallan Kumar. The main opposition Samajwadi Party (SP) says it put the mask-sanitiser drill in place at the party office since February.“At our office, the social distancing drill is followed. Masks and sanitisers are being used since February. The party office is closed due to lockdown, but when it opens we will ensure that our entire office is sanitised. Even today, we have a sanitiser in each room,” said Samajwadi Party’s Ashish Yadav ‘Sonu’. The Bahujan Samaj Party too claims to be ensuring cleanliness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/with-clean-politics-political-parties-in-up-lay-stress-on-covid-19-shield/story-GvcJGJkObdjDXyA1RgmriN.html

Therefore, skin care services including facial, cleansing or bleach are suspended for now,” he added.However, some beauty parlours have started providing skin services and also slashed rates by at least half to attract customers.Sweety Dua, owner of Shine Beauty Clinic in Model Town Extension, said, “I am entertaining customers with prior appointment only. I have also reduced charges of all the services in view of the financial distress faced by people at this time.”“As all economic operations remained shut for around two months, not every woman can afford a facial costing Rs 1,000, so I have cut down rates of all services, including facial, cleansing, threading, bleaching to half,” said Dua. Dua said trust between service provider and client remains a prime factor at this time.“Since morning, I received three clients. They are my regular customers. They know that I have been taking all preventive measures, including sanitisation of the parlour, wearing gloves and masks, keeping disposable towels and attending one customer at a time. During the pandemic, customers will take services of only those salons in which they have trust,” she said.Amarjot Kaur, a resident of BRS Nagar, who visited Dua’s beauty parlour for threading, said she decided to go to her since they are relatives.Riya Sharma, a resident of Ghumar Mandi, said, “I took an appointment to visit the parlour for waxing and was happy to see that the owner has taken all preventive measures. I was asked to wash hands at the gate, was given a new mask to wear and I made the payment through Paytm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/salons-beauty-parlours-reopen-with-precautions/story-7FV8k8zT2umSIeQMfXLO9O.html

18-05-2020||Chandigarh||Centre turns down Chandigarh’s request to quarantine foreign returnees at home||The central government has declined UT’s request to allow people returning from abroad to quarantine themselves at home instead of hotels.The UT administration was of the view that home quarantining foreign returnees was possible in Chandigarh since residents here were mostly well educated and houses were large enough to allow self-isolation protocols. Several residents had also approached the administration to allow home quarantining of their family members, rather than forcing them to stay in hotels, citing a higher risk of infection there.But, UT adviser Manoj Parida said, the Centre was not ready to accept UT’s request, which had also come in from various states.“Quarantining in hotels is the only option now as per the existing policy. We will make changes in case Centre amends its policy in the future,” he said. Ward number 1 councillor Mahesh Inder Singh Sidhu said there needed to be a more liberal approach. “All foreign returnees, who have been clinically declared negative, should be allowed to go home in a week’s time rather than keeping them at hotels for 14 days,” he said.Sector-8 resident Jaspreet Singh, who is waiting for his daughter’s return, said Punjab had already allowed quarantining of foreign returnees at home after an undertaking from parents. “UT should follow suit, since parents here are already willing to abide by any undertaking or protocols,” he said.PRIORITY LODGING OF RETURNEES IN MOUNTVIEW DONE AWAY: UT TO HCThe UT administration on Monday informed the Punjab and Haryana high court that the decision to lodge the returnees on priority basis in Hotel Mountview had been done away with. It said the administration had shortlisted four private hotels, apart from the two government hotels - Mountview and Shivalikview, who were willing to accommodate air passengers for 14 days of quarantine. “In the new standard operating procedure, the choice for the quarantine accommodation is left to the returnees according to their paying capacity,” UT stated, while adding that accommodation in hotel Mountview was costlier compared to other hotels. It informed the court that returnees who cannot afford expensive hotel accommodation can also opt for Panchayat Bhawan or Panjab University hostels.UT made these submissions in response to a PIL filed by the Sector 10 Resident Welfare Association, who apprehended the spread of Covid-19 in the sector in case the respondents were permitted to lodge the returnees in Hotel Mountview only.Disposing of the matter, HC stated that since mandatory requirement of lodging the returnees coming from abroad on priority basis in Hotel Mountview had been done away with, the primary grievance of the petitioner stood redressed.So far, 13 passengers have reached Chandigarh. While six are lodged in Mountview, the other seven are accommodated in other places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/centre-turns-down-chandigarh-s-request-to-quarantine-foreign-returnees-at-home/story-YZ62EXVGl9qFA80iWV0OzI.html

On March 25, 2015, Francis was served with a notice to appear in an immigration court, and he became the subject of removal proceedings.Ironical piece of US historyBut before he was packed into an ICE detention facility in the state of New York, Francis had become an ironic part of the US jurisprudence.In 2017, he challenged his detention by a local sheriff’s department for civil immigration violations in the appellate division of the New York Supreme Court. Francis had been detained on the purported authority of a detainer request issued by ICE and an accompanying administrative (not judicial) warrant.Though the court sustained the writ filed by Francis in 2018, he could not get relief as he was no longer in the sheriff’s detention.“Determining only the narrow issue before us, we conclude that the sheriff’s policy of December 2, 2016, directing the retention of prisoners, who would otherwise be released, pursuant to ICE detainers and administrative warrants is unlawful, and that Francis’s detention by the sheriff on December 11, 2017, which commenced after the termination of Francis’s court proceeding that day, was thus unlawful,’’ the court ruled.“The second department of the NY Supreme Court ruled that New York law does not authorise state and local authorities to arrest persons whose sole alleged infraction is being in the United States without documentation, conduct that federal immigration law treats as a civil violation. In fact, New York’s criminal procedure law permitted police officers to arrest a person only in response to a judicially issued warrant or for a misdemeanor or felony or a crime or any other conduct punishable by imprisonment or a fine, the court said,” said a communication from New York attorney general Letitia James.The New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) who had rendered legal assistance to Francis in the case termed the court judgment as a victory. His former NYCLU attorney Jordan Wells, when asked about his deportation, said that he hasn’t worked on his case in a long time. Wells has left the NYCLU and now works for American Civil Liberties Union in California.As for Francis, he will undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine on his arrival on Tuesday and then probably head to Sion, a Mumbai neighbourhood where his near and dear ones live.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-man-who-flew-to-us-24-years-ago-on-visitor-visa-deported/story-R6WiYmxDQtLSh7z9nzA6GN.html

Most part of the package is in liquidity and guarantees and unlike many other major economies in the world, there is not much direct cash support or demand push,” he said.The Congress leader said that the government announced a big package for MSMEs but did not do anything to protect the wages, salaries, and paycheques of about 11 crore people employed in this sector.These people need to know whether or not their wages will be paid,” he said adding that there was palpable tension and rising uncertainty among the working people of the country and their families.He said that the migrant workers walking hundreds of miles to their native places don’t really get the money.“The Centre has not given a clear signal of assistance to private firms which have already started large scale retrenchments and lay-offs, besides the pay cuts. Also, the package does not address the needs of small retailers. Stores that are shut still need to pay rentals and other bills are struggling to be viable businesses.The tendency of the consumer to go digital and use e-commerce channels has increased due to safety concerns in the wake of Covid-19 and this is beginning to cannibalise business from small retail, he said.“The kirana stores need liquidity as they were not allowed to sell non-essentials and in many areas which were under complete lockdown, these stores were not allowed to operate,” Sharma added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-leader-sudhir-sharma-urges-centre-to-rework-20-lakh-crore-package/story-pAZNgGAVmwTsT7Q4NdJUTO.html

A one-day hunger strike will be observed at Rajghat, New Delhi. Similarly, demonstrations will also be organised in the state, district and block headquarters.Himachal Pradesh’s convenor of the Joint Forum of Trade Union Kashmir Thakur said that the government and capitalists are using lockdown to increase exploitation of workers by making changes in labour laws.He said that like other states, working hours in Himachal have also been increased from eight hours to 12 hours under the Amending Factories Act, 1948 which will result in exploitation and retrenchment of workers and labourers. Changes in Industrial Dispute Act 1947 will ease the process of retrenchment of workers and they will also be deprived of retrenchment compensation.Joint Forum of Trade Unions have warned the central and state government to reverse anti-labour policies or they will intensify the labour movement.Joint Forum of Trade Unions has also written a letter to chief minister Jai Ram Thakur regarding this matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/trade-unions-to-hold-nationwide-protest-against-labour-law-changes-on-may-22/story-LBhbzYdF4lPTIHH8xEKZ4I.html

18-05-2020||Pune||Monday Musings: Facing lockdown 4.0, individually and collectively||Pune, along with the rest of the country will embark on the fourth phase of the Covid-19 lockdown on May 18, bringing far greater responsibility on us, individually and collectively. As compared to the first two phases of the lockdown, the third phase, lockdown 3.0, brought far greater relaxation on the restrictions in the non-containment zones. There was greater freedom of movement from home to offices and for making purchases, liquor sales were allowed in many parts of the country and all kinds of shops including hardware, stationery and general stories lifted their shutters. Last week, industrial estates opened up in Pimpri-Chinchwad, although, with many restrictions such as a limit of 33% workforce. The use of masks, sanitisers and handwash, ban on commuting to the factories by two-wheelers, frequent sanitising of the washrooms, safe distancing between workstations and staggered lunch breaks for workers are part of the Covid-19 SOPs (standard operating procedures) for factories. As has been very clearly explained in various interviews by Dr David Nabrro, the World Bank’s Special Envoys on Covid-19, what the lockdowns have done is to arrest the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus. One of the primary objectives of the lockdown was to contain the virus and prevent its spread. Economic activity, transportation of goods and the movement of people by public transport was brought to a complete halt during the lockdown. The other objective of the lockdown was to prepare the “defence mechanism” of every city and every country to deal with the virus once the lockdown is gradually relaxed and lifted to facilitate the revival of the economy. The creation of Covid care isolation and quarantine centres with hundreds of beds at Balewadi, Mhalunge and other places, along with dedicated hospitals with Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and ventilators is part of the defence mechanism that is being readied by a red zone district like Pune. As of May 15, Pune has had 174 deaths and more than 3,000 Covid-19 positive cases and the numbers are expected to rise further towards the month-end. What this means is that even if economic activity is revived and we start returning to our offices partially and gradually a set of precautions will have to be taken by us, individually and collectively. By now we are familiar with the importance of using face masks, social distancing, sanitisers, frequent handwash and not touching our face. Avoiding crowded places would be important for us, just as our offices will need to enforce the SOPs that would be specified by the government. Even if there are lesser restrictions during lockdown 4.0, we, as individuals, families, organisations and society as a whole will need to remain alert and take all the precautions necessary till this crisis is brought to rest. abhay.vaidya@hindustantimes.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/monday-musings-facing-lockdown-4-0-individually-and-collectively/story-E8P8OZZZka53LQEBTXAYkJ.html

She recently held an online gig with Delhi Youth Welfare Association, a not-for-profit organisation, to raise funds and awareness about the daily wage workers and migrant labourers. “You see so many videos of migrant workers walking for hundreds of kilometres without food or water. There is no conveyance; even if there are provisions, they are being duped and charged more by people who are taking advantage of their condition,” she says. Drawing attention to the plight of this workforce, she adds, “The policies are framed but are not showing results on the ground. Jinke paas khaane ke paise nahi hain voh aapko fare kahaan se denge. They have nothing to eat aur daal-roti-chawal koi exotic demand nahi hai.”  Her video garnered over 10k views and helped raise ₹35,000 so far .

In 2019, farmers had cultivated only 50,000 hectares through the DSR method. Confirming the imminent shortage, a Chandigarh-based senior official in the agriculture department, on condition of anonymity, said, the state has around 4 lakh litres of Pendimethalin in stock, which is sufficient for only 1.5 lakh hectares.Experts in the agriculture department agree that as there is high growth of weeds in the DSR method of cultivation, using Pendimethalin within 24-hours of seeding was a must. ‘INGREDIENTS NEED TO BE IMPORTED’ A production head at a weedicide manufacturing company said some of the ingredients used in Pendimethalin are imported and thus production of the chemical was suffering due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “Moreover, no one had anticipated that the demand for Pendimethalin would increase to this extent in the initial months of the year,” he added. A Patiala-based seller, Balwinder Kapoor, who possesses a stock of the chemical, says, “ Retailers are also not placing bulk orders as the product may not sell if the farmers find the method too difficult. Companies, too, are wary of producing the chemical in bulk. The uncertainty is hampering production and supply.”“Nowadays, companies are demanding advance payments. Earlier, they would allow a 90-day credit period. Retailers are short of cash and with uncertainty looming they are refraining from placing orders,” Kapoor said.‘AREA UNDER DSR MAY SUPERSEDE AUTHORITIES’ EXPECTATION’ Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Rajewal state general secretary Onkar Singh Agaul says, “With labour unavailable, farmers have taken to the DSR method with enthusiasm. Farmers and local agro-implement industries are modifying wheat seeders to provide a quick and cheaper alternative. The area cultivated using the DSR method maybe much higher than authorities expect”. “The government must ensure adequate supply of the weedicide and avoid inflation and duplicity during the peak demand,” he said.DON’T BLINDLY CHOOSE DSR: OFFICIALS TO FARMERS Officials of the agriculture department, however, say farmers must not blindly choose the DSR method. “Farmers must seek expert guidance before using the DSR method as the technique requires a different set of skills, including choosing suitable land, wise use of weedicide, its sowing time and watering pattern,” cautions an agriculture department official. “Despite advertisements and warnings about the dos and don’ts, farmers are over-enthusiastic about DSR without comprehending the benefits and technical issues” says Patiala chief agriculture officer SS Walia.Director state agriculture department Sutantar Singh says the department is in touch with weedicide manufacturing companies and farmers will not face shortage of Pendimethalin. “Hoarding any pesticide or weedicide, price inflation and duplicity will dealt with strictly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-take-to-direct-seeded-rice-method-amid-labour-shortage-punjab-stares-at-weedicide-shortage/story-i9qskxkFwRYxeLT52nq6ZK.html

18-05-2020||Chandigarh||Meet the commoners silently helping the needy in locked-down Kashmir||Lockdown in Kashmir since mid-March has put added strain on those who were already reeling under economic stress due to months of restrictions since August 2019, when the special status of Jammu and Kashmir was revoked.To offer them relief amid the Covid-19 crisis, many administrative agencies and social organisations have come forward to feed the poor and provide safety kits to health workers. But there are also a significant number of common people who, without any institutional support, have been silently helping those in need. Here are five such philanthropists:Ovais Maknoo, 29, Businessman, BaramullaAs soon as Kashmir’s first Covid-19 cases were reported, Maknoo and his two friends decided to contribute in whatever way they could. He noticed that not only common people but even doctors were desperately looking for face masks. “The first thing we did was to hire a few tailors to sew cloth masks. Within days we managed to produce 2,000 masks,” said Maknoo, who has a distribution business of provisional food items.Soon they realised that the problem was more severe than scarcity of masks, people were getting short of food and essentials too as the lockdown kept extending. More like-minded people joined them and they decided to distribute food kits comprising rice, flour, spices, dals and soaps to the needy. “It was very challenging. People here were already in deep stress since August 2019 and the lockdown meant that thousands of daily wagers, cart pullers, labourers, drivers and elderly were in desperate need,” he said.“To cater to their monthly requirement, we distributed 500 food kits in the urban areas of Baramulla and then in the second phase, to some 850 families in the district’s rural parts,” he said.Sharmeen Mushtaq Nizami, 43, Doctor, SrinagarNizami with his three colleagues has been running a trust to help critical care patients buy medicines and other treatments. A medical officer at a government hospital, Nizami says she experienced pain very closely when her husband died of pancreatic cancer. “We are in this field and see how patients suffer. One feels their pain and witnesses them get economically drained due to diseases like cancer. When I help, it gives me joy,” she said.They provide financial assistance and arrange medicines for patients suffering from life-consuming diseases like cancer, and those needing dialysis and post-transplant patients. “We sponsor some patients monthly, but during the past two months, we saw things becoming more difficult. Patients going though kidney dialysis, hypertension, cancer, and diabetes and post-transplant approached us during these days. We help them get medicines at their doorsteps,” she said.Feroz Ahmad Kuchay, 41, government employee, SrinagarKuchay witnessed poverty at a young age after his father’s death. So, when he started earning, he made it a point to help those in need. For the past four years, he along with a group of like-minded people has been providing monthly food kits to dozens of families in the Old City area of Srinagar.“When Covid-19 cases started here, I thought more needed to be done as many people who once used to be my donors were in need of help during the lockdown,” he said adding, “My faith wants me to help those in need and it gives me solace.”He prepared food kits apart from those he used to deliver monthly to the needy. “For the past two months, we have helped some 70 families by providing them flour, spices, cooking oil, ghee etc,” he said. “Some come seeking cash assistance to buy their medicines and we help them,” he said.Mushtaq Ahmad Rigoo, 29, farmer of PulwamaWhen the lockdown was imposed, Rigoo, a resident of Khrew in Pulwama, saw how the only ambulance at the public health centre near his home was insufficient to cater to critical patients needing medical attention. He and his brother then decided to utilise their two vehicles to help patients reach hospitals.“We shared our number in WhatsApp groups and pasted posters for ill-patients looking to reach hospitals. Since then, I have been ferrying people without any charge and even delivering them medicines at their doorsteps,” he said.“We helped around 150 patients reach hospitals in Srinagar, eight of whom were due for childbirth. Once the local SHO asked me to bring back a youth from Jammu whose detention orders were revoked. I took his father along and travelled 600km to and fro,” he said.“There is no reward better than the peace of mind one gets upon doing a good deed,” he said.Zubair Ahmad Dar, 30, government employee, BaramullaDar was shocked when he saw a social media post by a doctor in March saying that shortage of protective gear was putting their and patients’ lives in danger. “I knew our medical system was in a shambles, but I thought at least our doctors should be able to treat without fear,” he said.He and a few others met a health official to know about what could be done to help. “They needed PPE kits, so we asked them to provide us some samples of the same. We hired tailors and started making PPE kits,” Dar said.“We used to visit Srinagar during the night amid the lockdown to arrange material for the kits. Within a few weeks, we managed to produce 1,000 kits with 300 of them being waterproof,” he said.“Then demands started pouring in for masks and face shields from hospitals, police and even journalists. We managed to produce some 10,000 non-woven face masks. We made the face shields using stationery items like plastic transparent file covers etc,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/meet-the-commoners-silently-helping-the-needy-in-locked-down-kashmir/story-0ApEDgQXPXEvP9NmRHHdZL.html

18-05-2020||Chandigarh||High-risk deportation flight with 132 Haryana, Punjab immigrants to land on May 19||A special high-risk charter (SHRC) mission conducted by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will repatriate 161 illegal Indian migrants, including 132 from Haryana and Punjab, on May 19. The chartered flight run by the ICE air operations, the air transportation arm of the US agency entrusted with the task to remove illegal migrants from American soil, will land on Tuesday evening at Amritsar’s Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee International airport with 76 illegal immigrants from Haryana and 56 from Punjab on board.As per a US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) communication to New Delhi, these immigrants were in the custody of ICE at detention centres in Texas, Arizona, California, New York and Washington. Most of the detainees from Haryana and Punjab besides Goa, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil Nadu were kept in detention at Prairieland Detention Center in Texas.MANDATORY QUARANTINE PROTOCOLThe deportees, as per the standard operating protocol, will have to undergo mandatory 14-day quarantine on their arrival due to the Covid-19 situation. Secretary, NRI Affairs, Punjab, Rahul Bhandari, said deportees from Punjab will be quarantined in their respective districts, while those from Haryana will be quarantined in their home state.“We are trying to tie up with far-off states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and will quarantine their deportees if they request us to do so,” he added.Haryana officials said they were working out the modalities for quarantining the deportees.

18-05-2020||Delhi||International Museum Day 2020: Preserving the pandemic memorabilia is no easy feat||With the coffers being hit, museums across the world have been forced to forego, in partial or in full, safekeeping of the past, and focus on the present with an eye towards the future. Reportedly, the Museum of London has asked people to donate objects that reflect their life during the Covid-19 pandemic. From face masks to slippers, documentary evidences have come in various forms. And more than 900 pieces of work have been submitted already to the Covid Art Museum — a virtual gallery created by three advertising creatives from Barcelona — that aims to document life in the lockdown on social media.  As COVID-19 affects our lives in unprecedented ways, we want to collect objects and experiences of Londoners. From how London has transformed from a bustling metropolis to a maze of hushed streets, to the effects on our social & working lives. More info: https://t.co/xr4l6v9599 pic.twitter.com/iCYOJS6ZYQIn the United States, the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History is collecting objects including personal protection equipment (PPE) and patients’ illustrations. In India, however, an initiative to archive such materials is yet to be initiated. Sanjib Kumar Singh, archaeologist at the National Museum in Delhi, says museums are pivotal in protecting the culture and experiences of a place. ‘’We must focus on both tangible and intangible aspects of the pandemic when we eventually go out to record how coronavirus impacted India. From masks, PPE kits to thermometers and photos, all will go on to help future generations understand this period,’’ he says.  '𝐑𝐄𝐕𝐈𝐓𝐀𝐋𝐈𝐒𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐌𝐔𝐒𝐄𝐔𝐌𝐒 & 𝐂𝐔𝐋𝐓𝐔𝐑𝐀𝐋 𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄𝐒'DMCS is delighted to present a webinar to commemorate the International Museum Day on the 18th of May 2020. The webinar will go live on our Facebook page: DMCS2020 at 4.30 PM IST. Save a spot & share away! pic.twitter.com/tkvSqoQ1giGurugram-based Aditya Arya, who has converted a badminton court into a camera museum to showcase the art and science of photography, believes that photographers are the best visual historians and future generations will rely on images as an important source of reference. He has started an initiative called Lockdown Diaries, where people can upload images of their life as it’s being experienced during the pandemic. For what he calls as a means to capture ‘the journal of our times,’ Arya says, “While we are all in isolation and confined to our homes, our lives continue even during this standstill. It is the little things that we have started paying attention to what was formerly an insignificant aspect of our lives. We intend to create an exhibition with prints of such images at Museo Camera, once the things are back to normal.’’ Author Kishwar Desai, however, feels that the time to document the pandemic in India is still at least six months away. Desai, who is the Chairperson of The Arts and Cultural Heritage Trust that set up The Partition Museum in Amritsar, opines, “To ask people to donate to the museums for documentation may come across as insensitive at the moment as the wound [of battling the coronavirus] is still fresh for many. It’s also impractical to an extent during the lockdown.’’ But, Desai does accord great significance to the oral history that can be preserved at this point in time. “Individuals can record their experiences in a diary, or videos, which can later become a part of the metanarrative of any museum. And these voices must come from all strata of the society; from migrants to NGOs to ordinary citizens who have responded to this crisis in different ways,” Desai adds.   Bani Abidi is a Pakistani artist who uses the medium of art to express her outlook on the Partition and its effects on the current scenario. Having completed her studies in painting and printmaking, she uses performance, video, photography, and digital imaging, to create installations that address issues of national and cultural identity in relation to Partition. In particular, she explores the emotional impact of politics and historical events on the people of the subcontinent. A large number of her artworks are video installations created in a documentary-style format. Though they refer to real situations, the scenes portrayed in her video are imaginary and often choreographed by the artist. One of her earliest works, 'Mangoes' (1999) shows a Pakistani and an Indian woman eating mangoes together. They each share stories about their childhood and nostalgia, which slowly turns into a chatter of competitive boasting about the fruit grown in their respective homelands. Through this work, Abidi reveals the idea of a shared history between the two women that has been severed due to Partition, as nations grew and developed in the subcontinent. Abedi also explores the larger theme of migration through her video installation, "Section Yellow", that shows the surreal and yet familiar situation of people applying for visas to cross borders. Through gestures and sounds, the artist looks at the psychological space of waiting rooms in visa offices, where people are waiting for their turn while planning for a life elsewhere. .

He elaborates: “We are in touch with different artists who are working under adverse conditions during the lockdown. NGMA is also taking the virtual route to digitise various documents. But, two things are for certain — People are not coming back to our brick and mortar buildings for a while, and we will have to rethink our long and short term strategies.’’ Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow @htlifeandstyle for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/international-museum-day-2020-preserving-the-pandemic-memorabilia-is-no-easy-feat/story-UkjmgCMFsspm82GdnuK8BI.html

18-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi disallows testing dead bodies for Covid||The Delhi government’s revised guidelines for the disposal of dead bodies of people with Covid-19 prohibit hospitals from collecting samples from the bodies.The new standard operating procedures (SoP), issued Sunday, have to be followed for the disposal of the bodies of those who tested positive for the disease before death, a person whose sample had been collected before death and tested positive after, or for any person who died after being admitted to a hospital on suspicion of having the viral infection.“No sample for Covid-19 test will be taken of a dead body. However, if doctors are satisfied from clinical examination that the cause of death may be Covid-19 infection, the dead body may be released as suspect Covid-19 infected dead body,” the order, issued by Delhi’s health secretary Padmini Singla, read.So far, Covid-19 designated hospitals were testing those brought dead to the hospital and suspected to have the infection, before releasing the body.The move is expected to help conserve testing kits. Recently, the Union ministry of health changed the country’s discharge policy for Covid-19 patients to allow those with mild to moderate symptoms to go back home without two negative tests, which were earlier required for a discharge.Only one negative swab test is required for those with severe infection, according to the revised guidelines.The Delhi guidelines on disposing of dead bodies mentions four scenarios: when the death happens in a hospital, if the death happens in other government isolation facilities for mild cases, if the death happens outside of these health care facilities, or if there is an unclaimed body or a body found in a public space.The SoPs state that in case if a person dies in a hospital or is brought dead to one, trained health care workers will have to handle and pack the body and provide a hearse van to carry the body to cremation or burial ground. After burial or cremation, the hearse van has to be properly disinfected. In case there are no relatives of the deceased, the body needs to be properly disinfected and kept in the mortuary; the hospital can decide if an autopsy is required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-disallows-testing-dead-bodies-for-covid/story-j5n7Dc011wNrZ4hDimi2FJ.html
18-05-2020||Delhi||Delhiwallah: City without hope||He had never imagined he would see such a day. “Calling Papa and Mummy in the village to send me urgent money filled me with sadness.... At my age, the son is supposed to give to the father, and not the father to give to the son.”But things have turned upside down for most of us. And Anil Kumar Shah, sadly, is no exception.Talking on WhatsApp video, this Gurugram gardener is puzzled by the circumstances. “I left the village to make a better living in the big city, and yet I have to depend on my father for survival.”His father is in his early 70s and looks after a small farming land in Bihar’s Motihari district. Mr Shah tries his best to make savings, but almost everything he earns is usually spent in the daily living of his own family in the Millenium City. He lives with his wife, Vibha Devi, and little sons, Ayush and Aryan, in a small one-room dwelling in Indira Colony. The photos were taken through the phone screen that connected them to this reporter.In his late 20s, Mr Shah looks after the private gardens of half a dozen residences in Sushant Lok. But he was recently unable to work for almost a month, because of the lockdown imposed by the coronavirus pandemic. Now, with a relative ease in the restriction on his movement, he has been able to go out and return to “duty”.The one month in which he had to stay at home was a trauma. “We exhausted our money,” he says. He thought of returning to the village but his wife persuaded him otherwise. There were no trains or buses, and informal transportation might have put the safety of the kids at risk. Ultimately, Mr Shah was forced to call his father for help, who sent them Rs 5,000 through complicated means — the details of which were difficult to understand over the phone chat.There was another reason for Mr Shah to stay on rather than to risk the long journey home. His father informed him on phone that those who managed to return were sent for a two-week quarantine in the village school. “Who knows what food they would have given us in the school, or if they would have given us anything at all... my region is very poor... that’s why we have to live and work so far.”Even so, one craves for love and shelter that only a home can offer in times of distress. Mr Shah has been in Gurugram for almost a decade, it is his home. But the city failed him, he feels. He says he closely followed in the news the fate of the labourers stranded without work and food in the cities they were working in, following the lockdown. “The city is not ours.”The house in Indira Colony is also feeling like a burden. “The landlord is demanding the full rent of ~5,000.”Once the lockdown eases further and trains start running to full capacity again, Mr Shah is strongly toying with the idea to go back to the village with his family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/city-without-hope/story-NnVPuCbz8Gj3WS2iVnCwAP.html

If we can’t do that then what’s the point of staying back,” says Suraj Kumar, hailing from Ambedkar Nagar in Uttar Pradesh, who seen walking with a 20-kg sack on his back. “We will come back once the factories become operational again,” he adds.Sanjay, another migrant who was seen walking in a group of about 50 people, said, “Ludhiana is our karmanbhoomi (place of work). We come back when everything is normal.”But not all are as forgiving. Ajay, a migrant, who along with six others, was cycling to his village at Muzaffarpur district in Bihar, said, “We worked at a spinning mill in Doraha. Since March, we have not been paid a penny by the mill owner. We have exhausted all our savings. We brought the cycle from the money sent by our families back home. We have been mistreated and will never return.”CHILDREN WORST HITWhile the adults fight their own battle with the uncertain furture, it’s the plight of the children walking with them that is the most heart-wrenching. Most are too young to understand what is happening and why they have to leave a place they once called home. While three-year-old Rohit was seen asking his mother to carry him in her arms, stating that he could not walk anymore, 11-year-old Subhnish, who was carrying the sack over his head, said he will miss his friends here.“Ludhiana was my home and Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh was the place where my grandparents live. My friends were asking me when I would return. I do not know,” he says as he continues on the odious journey, not sure how far home is.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/feel-betrayed-but-will-return-to-karambhoomi-ludhiana-once-things-are-normal-say-migrants/story-Qad1SBhiQxsd1e1tN1TPgI.html
18-05-2020||City||25 years on, Tibetan government-in-exile renews call for Panchen Lama’s release||On the 25th anniversary of his disappearance, the Tibetan government-in-exile on Sunday demanded China to release the 11th Panchen Lama Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, considered to be a reincarnation of Bodhisattva Amitabha.In a statement issue here, Sikyong (president) of the exiled government, Lobsang Sangay, said China’s abduction of the Panchen Lama and forcible denial of his religious identity and the right to practice in his monastery is not only a violation of religious freedom but also a gross violation of human rights.Panchen Lama was just six years old when he was allegedly abducted by the Chinese government on May 17, 1995, along with his family members, after he was recognised by the Dalai Lama as the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama.“Since that day, Buddhists around the world and Tibetans in exile have been living in the hope that one day they will be able to receive his blessings,” said Sangay.After orchestrating the disappearance of the 11th Panchen Lama, Sangay alleged that China, a self-declared atheist government and infamous for its persecution of religious groups, placed a young boy, Gyaltsen Norbu, as their own 11th Panchen Lama.“This politically-motivated action failed, however, to displace the position of the true Panchen Lama from the hearts and minds of the Tibetan people. For Tibetans and Buddhists around the world, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima will always be the true Panchen Lama,” he added.Today marks the 25th anniversary of the 11th Panchen Lama’s disappearance, said Sangay, adding that 25 years is a significant time in an individual’s life.He said the communist government must honour its claim of ethnic harmony in China by fulfilling the aspirations of the Tibetan people.“It must right the wrong and release the 11th Panchen Lama along with his family, Chadrel Rinpoche, and all Tibetans unjustly imprisoned,” he said while appealing to the international community to make a concerted effort to press China to release Nyima and resolve the critical human rights situation in Tibet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/25-years-on-tibetan-government-in-exile-renews-call-for-panchen-lama-s-release/story-kuiP1GofAVkQ9MZSKwPCpM.html

18-05-2020||City||NGOs conduct meeting with police officials, take up migrants’ problems||Getting no ration, being cheated by private bus operators and becoming an easy target of snatchers are some of the prominent problems being faced by migrants in the city.These issues were highlighted by social activists and members of various non-government organisations (NGOs) during a meeting held with police officials at the Moti Nagar police station here on Sunday.The meeting, which was held under instructions of deputy commissioner of police Akhil Chaudhary, was attended by additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP–4) Ajinder Singh and other police officials. In the meeting, police officials briefed about the migrant welfare committees to be formed at ward, area or village levels to solve the problems of migrants.Social workers apprised police officials about the problems being faced by the migrants during the meeting.RK Yadav from Yadav Ahir Mahasabha, an NGO, said, “A number of migrants are still not getting ration despite applying on the helpline number. There are some migrants, who do not have mobile phones and Aadhaar cards, so it is difficult for them to apply and get ration.”“Besides, some private bus operators are charging Rs 3,000-Rs 4,000 from migrants to take them to their hometowns. But, when the buses are stopped in Haryana or are not allowed to enter Uttar Pradesh, these migrants are forced to cover the remaining distance on foot. If these buses are not allowed to enter other states, then why these bus operators are being given permission to ferry passengers. Are the migrants not being cheated and harassed?,” he pointed outYadav added, “As some factories and shops have opened but, during evening hours, roads remain deserted and when migrant workers are returning to their quarters, some miscreants are targeting these workers and snatching their mobile phones. Incidents of snatchings are increasing in the city amid lockdown. So, police should increase patrolling during evening hours.”Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP–headquarters) Deepak Pareek said the administration has received permission to run buses for 10 districts of Uttar Pradesh and the administration is working on starting buses.As of now, some private bus operators are operating buses without permission from the state government due to which they were not being allowed to enter states.Talking on the safety of migrants, ADCP Pareek said, “As many as 42 check points have been set up in different areas in the city where police personnel are present 24 hours. Further, we are regularly creating awareness among the migrants not to roam about unnecessarily on the roads. If they do not have shelter, we are also offering them the facility of shelter homes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ngos-conduct-meeting-with-police-officials-take-up-migrants-problems/story-rQOKlIctDUTAXtE2cwjllK.html

A cordon was laid and as the security forces zeroed in on the built-up area where terrorists were hiding, the terrorists fired upon them triggering the encounter, said inspector general of police Mukesh Singh.In the encounter that followed, Tahir Ahmed Bhat was killed and an AK 47 rifle and magazine were recovered.Tahir Ahmed Bhat joined the terror outfit early last year. “His name had figured in the fabrication of IED which exploded near a CRPF convoy at Banihal in March 2019. He had subsequently visited Chenab Valley and was given the task of recruiting youth and reviving Hizb activities in the Chenab valley,” the IGP added.He was also part of a group of Hizb terrorists who killed RSS activist Chanderkant Sharma and his PSO in April 2019.The same AK 47 rifle which was taken away that time has been recovered after the encounter today, said the IGP.“With this operation, an attempt of the terror outfit to revive activities in Doda has been nipped. The designs of the Hizb to target security forces convoy and camps have also been thwarted. Tahir Bhat was a close associate of the present operational commander of Saifullah alias Dr Saif and was assigned the task of ‘revival of terrorism’ in Chenab Valley comprising Doda, Kishtwar and Ramban districts by recruiting more youth from there,” said the IGP.Chenab valley was declared militancy free in the late 1990s.The slain terrorist was directed by his mentors to target security forces and carry out some sensitive and sensational attacks in Chenab Valley to create insecurity among the people and to disturb the peaceful atmosphere. He was complicit in several terror crimes including attacks on security establishments and civilian atrocities.Singh said that his killing will create a huge deterrence to the revival of militancy in Chenab Valley.A day after Hizb chief Riyaz Naikoo was killed in Kashmir, security forces on May 7 arrested an overground worker of the outfit from Doda district.He was identified as Raqib Alam, 22, son of Seeraj Din, a resident of Swanda village.There has been a spurt in terror activities across J&K amid Covid 19 pandemic.Jammu region’s Doda area comprising Doda, Kishtwar and Ramban districts, which have been declared militancy free, have also witnessed terror attacks and related activities amid the lockdown.Security forces on April 17 eliminated two Hizb-ul-Mujahideen terrorists, who had hacked a special police officer (SPO) to death with an axe and critically injured another on April 13 in Dachhan area of Kishtwar district.The National Investigation Agency on Friday filed a chargesheet against six people, including three slain Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) terrorists and three arrested overground workers of the terror group for providing support to Pakistan-based terrorists to kill BJP leader Anil Parihar and his brother Ajeet Parihar in Jammu’s Kishtwar.The chargesheet has been filed in the special NIA Court, Jammu against the six accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hizb-ied-expert-killed-in-doda-encounter-army-jawan-martyred/story-ODqRCFytMhfS7nUIoSQnqK.html

The spot where the burst occurred is 150-metre away from the powerhouse.The 100m MV hydroelectric power project was in the testing phase.Jogindernagar sub-divisional magistrate Amit Mehra said that as per report 8-megawatt electricity was being generated through one of the turbines.“Penstock bursted when the engineers increased pressure to enhance the load to 16-megawatt. He said that one of the engineers climbed up the hillock, where the burst took place and closed the penstock valve, preventing further damage. The damage is being assessed,” he said. Uhal-III hydropower project is being executed by HPSEBL-run Beas Valley Power Corporation (BVPC).The HPSEBL had estimated the project cost at ₹1,000 crore and the project was to be completed by 2009. However, the project deadline was revised four times in the last 11 years, pushing the cost to ₹1,800 crore.The cost overrun was caused by delay in land acquisition and non-performance by the contractors.The project has three turbines of 33.3-megawatt capacity each. Once fully operational, the project will generate about 450 million units of electricity every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/close-shave-for-30-as-uhal-iii-project-s-penstock-bursts/story-qhmJDEPzIrAzZr2GTlpYqJ.html

18-05-2020||Chandigarh||Increase in borrowings will provide much-needed liquidity: Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar||The central government’s decision to increase the borrowing limits of states from 3% to 5% of the gross state domestic product (GSDP) for 2020-21 will help open up the fiscal space and provide much needed liquidity for the financially stressed Haryana government.The state government has been struggling to raise financial resources even after the resumption of economic activity post-April 20 relaxations.The drastically changed economic situation has forced the state government to heavily rely on market borrowings for running its day-to-day affairs. The state has borrowed Rs 5,000 crore in April and Rs 2,000 crore in May to tide over the fiscal crisis. It spends anything between Rs 6,200 to Rs 7,500 crore every month on payment of salaries, pensions of retired employees, social security pensions, wages to contractual employees, rural electrification and domestic subsidy, and payment of interests and debts.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who also holds the finance portfolio, on Sunday said the increased borrowing limits allowed by the Centre would help them achieve the targets envisaged for various sectors which stood adversely impacted due to Covid-19 lockdown.Additional chief secretary (ACS) finance TVSN Prasad said the state government was keyed up to embark on the reforms programme announced by the Union finance minister on Sunday. “The proposed reforms will also provide a window of opportunity for fundamental, structural and fiscal reforms which will improve the efficiency of four sectors along with the service delivery,” Prasad said. An ordinance will be promulgated by the state government to amend the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act to facilitate increased borrowings.A part of the borrowings have been linked to specific reforms like implementation of ‘One nation one ration card’, district level and licensing reforms for ease of doing business, power sector reforms and reforms for strengthening urban local bodies.Prasad said to provide adequate infrastructure and services in municipal areas, particularly to the area where economically weaker sections reside, it is important to update and strengthen tax recovery and user charge systems from economically affluent areas, and cross subsidise. “With this kind of reform, the urban local bodies will be able to develop capacity to deliver their mandate better, in the true spirit of the 74th amendment of the Constitution,” the ACS said.Following the announcement by the Union finance minister, the central government on Sunday told the states that the additional debt will have to be balanced against the need for long-term debt sustainability. This is important that excess borrowing undertaken does not lead to adverse impacts in the future. In order to ensure sustainability, there is a need to increase future GSDP growth and revenues and reduce unproductive future expenditures, said a finance ministry communication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/increase-in-borrowings-will-provide-much-needed-liquidity-haryana-cm-manohar-lal-khattar/story-sGw7EvGWn6umtaGVQB4GRP.html

A video also surfaced on social media platforms showing many of them running away to nearby fields, leaving behind their luggage, cycles and footwear. SP Himanshu Garg said, “Some migrants tried to block the highway and also pelted stones at policemen. Mild force was used to send them back to the shelter home. No FIR has been registered in the case.”“Most of the protesters belonged to Bihar. Currently, they are being sent back only by trains. We are sending migrants from UP by buses and that is why they demanded to be sent by buses as well. However, buses are plying regularly as no-objection certificates for these are easy to obtain from other states. But in the case of trains, Railways ministry gets involved and coordination between all parties take time,” SP Garg added.

Forty-one of them had high-risk comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension and heart ailments.Hours before the Centre announced it officially on Sunday evening, the Maharashtra government extended the ongoing lockdown by two weeks till May 31. The state government is expected to soon issue its own notification, extending some relaxations for commercial-industrial activities and bringing clarity on the delineation of the zones (red, orange and green). “Although the state government cannot dilute the restrictions imposed by the Centre, it has been given powers to prepare buffer/micro zones. This may increase the number of containment zones, but actual area will decrease, leaving room for activities in the remaining area. Also, the state had not relaxed some restrictions, even though the Centre had allowed them, in the last notification. For instance, the relaxations to allow more employees in government and private offices, or operating non-essential shops in a staggered manner even in red zones, were not implemented in cities like Mumbai, Thane, Pune and Nashik. The state can now go ahead with the opening of few more shops and increasing attendance in offices,” said a senior government official.The state, in the past two days, allowed manufacturers of umbrella, raincoats and plastic sheets to operate their units and retailers to sell them by putting them in the list of essential services. Similarly, the government has allowed employees of regional transport offices and sub-registrars to be at their workplaces, so at to ensure registration of vehicles and flats. “The notification issued on Sunday by the Centre will help us restructure containment zones by shrinking them. Commercial and other activities outside containment zones would thus be allowed. This is a very important step towards reviving the economy. At the same time, lockdown restrictions in containment zones will have to be followed strictly,” said public works department minister and former chief minister Ashok Chavan. He said that the nod for public transport between states may come as a respite for migrant workers, who have been risking their lives to reach their home states.The state saw 10,682 cases in just seven days, while the deaths reported in this period were 366. Of them, in Mumbai, 6,441 cases and 226 deaths were during the past week. The month of May saw 21,616 cases and 739 deaths in Maharashtra, which included 13,119 cases and 444 deaths in Mumbai. This means 31.76% cases and 38.31% deaths in the state have come in the past 17 days. The first case of Covid-19 in the state was on March 9. After having crossed 25,000 cases on May 13, the next 5,000 in the state were reported in just three days. On May 9, the state tally had touched 20,220. The state took 53 days for its first 10,000 cases.The number of tests in the state touched 2,73,239 on Sunday. 24,0186 of them were negative, which means 20.48% tested positive.Maharashtra’s mortality rate has dropped to 3.70% against national rate of 3.16%, while the doubling rate in Maharashtra is little more than 10 days.A total of 3,48,508 people are currently under home quarantine, while 17,638 are under institutional quarantine. 14,972 teams of health workers have screened 63.83 lakh people for suspected infection, after they came in contact with patients. 7,688 patients, including 600 on Sunday, have fully recovered from various hospitals, after testing positive in the past nine weeks.The state has 1,688 containment zones. In Mumbai, the municipal corporation has broken the zones into smaller ones for better monitoring.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that owing to the change in discharge policy by the Centre, the recovery rate among the patients in the state has improved. “Of the 7,688 patients who have been discharged after recovery so far, 50% or 3,700 are in the past one week,” he said. Chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, who issued orders on Sunday afternoon, using powers conferred under the Disaster Management Act, also had a meeting with the Union cabinet secretary late on Sunday. The state has also clarified that guidelines on relaxations in the ongoing lockdown will be issued in due course.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had hinted at the extension of the lockdown and had also demanded that the Centre allows operations of suburban trains in Mumbai, but only for essential services. The Central notification is, however, silent on the demand. “Activities in green zones will be fully permitted by keeping district boundaries sealed. It will be applicable to orange zones, excluding containment zones” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-over-2-000-cases-in-a-day-tally-33-053/story-lZskYMmNYWAcFfDzNwsFaO.html
18-05-2020||Mumbai||Medical students in Mumbai finally get stipend, but lose 10% to I-T||Four days after HT had reported that medical students in the civic-run hospitals had not received their stipend for almost three months, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation on Sunday finally disbursed their remuneration. However, 10% of the total remuneration received by the students has been deducted under income tax (I-T) owing to the new vendor registration policy. As per the new rule, medical students, including interns, resident doctors and senior medical officers, are considered vendors, undergo vendor registration and are therefore, are liable for 10% tax deduction. The taxation policy has only been introduced for medical students working at BMC hospitals and not other government hospitals. Students from King Edward Memorial (KEM), BYL Nair and Topiwala General Municipal hospitals have also written to BMC over the issue and have raised concerns about the deduction of money without a prior intimation.Dr Ramesh Bharmal, BMC’s director of medical education, justified the tax deductions. “These doctors are being paid by BMC and so they will have to pay taxes like other Indians. They may be students but they are also taking money from the corporation, making them employees,” he said. Doctors, however, said that medical students cannot be made to pay taxes as they are still pursuing their studies and paying fees to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). “In other states, students are given additional allowances for working on Covid duty. Senior doctors who just come on rounds are getting Covid allowances. But here, money is being deducted from our stipend,” said a resident doctor from Nair Hospital.Medical students on graduating are stationed at civic hospitals as interns, and paid ₹6,000 in BMC medical colleges. During their post-graduation, students are paid ₹54,000 per month, post which during their bond posting, they get a monthly stipend of ₹82,000. “We pay our fees to the medical institutions as students. In fact, the services that we provide to patients in hospitals fall are being practiced as a part of our curriculum. We are assigned marks for it. We are not registered BMC employees to be qualified for taxes. If the government wants to take taxes, they shouldn’t ask us to pay fees,” said another student from KEM Hospital.Students also alleged that the step is extremely discouraging for those who are working round the clock to treat Covid patients at a time when their exams have also been delayed. Most final-year students fear that their plans for further studies will be affected owing to the delay in the exams due to the coronavirus outbreak.“When the outbreak started, our colleges suspended classes and assigned us on Covid duties. Many doctors are as young as 18 years and directly face the threat of virus. Shouldn’t the authorities appreciate us instead of treating us mere vendors?” said a student who has been stationed at Sion Hospital’s Covid ward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/medical-students-in-mumbai-finally-get-stipend-but-lose-10-to-i-t/story-UeadjFc8JFs6RWmWH0VUyI.html

Around 2,000 persons have been affected. “Our pension payment that comes out to be around Rs 4.5 crore a month has not been released on the pretext of shortage of funds, whereas salary to the tune of Rs 24 crore of regular staff, including the registrar and the finance officer (the custodian of accounts of university) has been made on May 12, which a great injustice to senior class citizens,” said Sham Singh, president, Punjabi University Retired Officers Welfare Association. Punjabi University Retired Teachers association president Gurmel Singh said the varsity had been repeatedly not following the orders of the Supreme Court and the high court on timely payments of pensions to the employees. “The HC has maintained that the pensioners are to be paid between the 7th and the 10th of each month. On not doing this, the university has to pay 10% interest,” Singh claimed. Varsity registrar Prof Manjit Singh Nijjar said, “The university is making every possible effort to arrange funds.

18-05-2020||City||Cheeta-led gang transferred Rs 6-crore drug money to Hizbul Mujahideen: Police||The interrogation of Ranjit Singh Rana, alias Cheeta — the kingpin in the 532-kg heroin seizure case — and his aides by the police has revealed that they had transferred Rs 6-crore drug money to the terror outfit Hizbul Mujahideen during the past five years. Officials privy to investigations said Cheeta and his accomplices had been in direct link with Pakistan’s spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) for the smuggling of heroin from across the border, and for transferring the drug money to the terror outfit. They said the gang members had cleared five drug consignments through Attari-Wagah border before the seizure of 532-kg heroin. The officials said the police have also identified around 10 more members of the gang which will be nabbed soon. Some of them are from Tarn Taran, Ferozepur and Jalandhar districts, they added. In June 2019, the officials of the customs department had recovered 532-kg heroin and 52-kg mixed narcotics, worth over Rs 2,700 crore, which were smuggled from across the border in a rock salt-laden truck, at the integrated check post (ICP), Attari, which facilitates India’s trade with Pakistan and Afghanistan. Following this, the customs officials had arrested some Amritsar-based importers and a Jammu and Kashmir-based man, whose interrogation revealed that Cheeta was the kingpin of the racket. Cheeta was arrested on May 9 by Punjab Police from Begi village in Haryana’s Sirsa district with his brother Gagandeep Singh, alias Bhola. Cheeta was nabbed following Amritsar commissionerate’s investigation into the case in which Hizbul terrorist Hilal Ahmed Wagay of Kashmir was held on April 25. Wagay had come to Amritsar in a truck to collect Rs 29 lakh from two unidentified men on the instructions of the terror outfit’s slain commander Riyaz Ahmed Naikoo. After Wagay’s arrest with Rs 29 lakh, a team led by Amritsar deputy commissioner of police (DCP-investigation) Mukhwinder Singh Bhullar was formed to investigate the case. The team’s investigation also helped Jammu & Kashmir police, which killed Naikoo in a joint operation with the army, the officials said. Later on, the team arrested Bikram Singh, alias Vicky, and Maninder Singh, alias Money, of Amritsar. Vicky and Money confessed that they had given Rs 29 lakh to Wagay on the instructions of Cheeta and his cousins Iqbal Singh, alias Shera, and Sarwan Singh of Havelian village. Later, two more members of the gang — Jaswant Singh and Ranjit Singh of Gurdaspur — were also arrested. The duo’s interrogation led to Cheeta’s arrest, the officials said. ‘MADE PAYMENTS TO ISI TOO’“Cheeta’s cousin Iqbal Singh had been in direct link with ISI through various social media applications. The gang had been getting the heroin supply directly from the ISI. Cheeta has told us that they had been paying Rs 8 to 10 lakh per kg to the ISI, through various transaction methods, including hawala, through Dubai,” said one of the investigators, seeking anonymity.He said, “Sometimes, the gang meenbers used to transfer the money to Hizbul operatives on the ISI’s instructions. Cheeta has confessed that they had transferred Rs 6 crore to the terror outfit in parts. Most of the time, Hizbul operatives collected the drug money from the smugglers under the guise of truck drivers.”He added, “Before the recovery of 532 kg heroin, Cheeta had got smuggled five consignments — of 150kg, 100kg, 75kg, 35kg and 3 kg — through the land border.”Another official said, “The earlier five consignments were further smuggled to various parts of Punjab and the adjoining states.” Meanwhile, DCP Bhullar said, “We are investigating as to where the accused had been supplying the heroin.”On Saturday, the commissionerate police had recovered 2 kg heroin at Cheeta’s instance at his Ram Tirath road house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cheeta-led-gang-transferred-rs-6-crore-drug-money-to-hizbul-mujahideen-police/story-9rtFhAO0wKIlzxmOE3F6gL.html

18-05-2020||City||Migrants’ walk of pain meets document hurdle at Gujarat-Maharashtra border||Amid the lockdown, the Maharashtra-Gujarat border check-post at Talasari in Maharashtra’s Palghar district is bustling with cars, trucks and buses, with motorists running from one counter to the other with necessary documents to cross over to the neighbouring state. Lost among the sea of vehicles are the labourers – most of whom have walked all night to avoid the heat or those who have hitch-hiked their way to the border with the help of truck and bus drivers. Their trek comes to a halt, but the struggle continues, as the police claim a majority of them carry medical certificates, but not a police permission letter, forcing some to wait for as long as four days to cross the border.“We requested truck drivers to drop us till wherever they could. After 12 hours and changing two trucks, one driver dropped us at the Talasari checkpost. We’ve been sitting in this scorching heat since 10am because we can’t afford a vehicle to cross the border,” says Raju Gajjar, a labourer from Dhandhuka city of Gujarat, who has been working in Thane for the past few years.The police document required to cross the border states those interested in crossing borders should share details of a vehicle and the driver of the vehicle only “in case” they choose such a mode of transport. Labourers, however, allege the police don’t accept their forms without a vehicle and at least 35-40 people have been waiting at the Maharashtra side for the past two days.The Thane police commissionerate, however, says there’s no rule that demands labourers to travel by a vehicle only. “The guidelines prescribed by the Central government clearly state that migrants who want to cross the state borders without vehicles should be facilitated by the state concerned, who should be making arrangements of shelter and food for free. We are following the written guidelines,” said Balasaheb B Patil, deputy commissioner of police, Thane.“We have no work in the city anymore so some of us from the same village decided to go back home together. Neither the local Thane police nor the police at the checkpost are helping us,” says Gajjar, who is accompanied by 13 people, including two kids.In some cases, the workers pool in money to hire a large van or a mini bus. However, such an exercise costs them anywhere between ₹35,000-₹40,000, says one of the labourers. “If we could afford that kind of money, we’d still live in the city. The reason we all want to go back home is because we have no money for food and survival,” says Gajjar.A little away is another group of 15-odd labourers, who work in Mumbai and Thane as help or daily wage workers. Their problem is the same. “The queue to get a seat in any of the government buses is long and hiring a private vehicle is out of question. As we only need to cross one state border, we decided to walk, but the border police is not helping us,” says Manju Kumbhar, who hails from Patan, Gujarat. “We tried approaching the police station, but they ask for details of the vehicle and driver. We told them we will hitch-hike, to which they refuse to accept our application forms,” says Jignesh Dholakia, another youth stuck on the border on his way to Ahmedabad. “We are trying to cross just one state border. We can’t imagine how much trouble others who are travelling to Rajasthan or Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are facing.”Two Chennai residents, who work as drivers in Rajasthan, too, had to wait for a while. “After waiting in queue for a day at a doctor’s clinic, we had to wait for four days to get the seal of approval from the local police station. The queues are never ending at every police station,” says PU Sivanandakumar, one of the drivers who was crossing borders from Bhilad in Valsad (Gujarat) to Talasari. “We still have a long way to go and hope the process is smooth at the other border.”Amid the chaos, there’s some respite from the Talasari tehsildar’s office, whose staff members provide food and water to the stranded. “We find at least 50-70 people waiting, some for almost a week, while others have gone back to Mumbai and Thane. When the state borders first opened, the labourers would be stuck and waiting here in thousands, but the number has reduced over days,” said an officer from the Talasari tehsildar’s office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrants-walk-of-pain-meets-document-hurdle-at-gujarat-maharashtra-border/story-B9jcPb57FPTsXT9PVwzy0I.html

18-05-2020||Gurugram||Three men booked for killing brother-in-law in Jharsa||Three men were booked for allegedly killing their 42-year-old brother-in-law in their house in Jharsa on Friday night. The victim’s family had alleged that the three brothers had poisoned him to death.The police said the victim, Sombir Ram, had gone to his in-laws’ house in Jharsa on Friday to reconcile with his wife, who had come to live with her parents after an altercation with him in April. According to the police, the incident took place around 8.30 pm when the Ram was discussing the matters with his wives’ brothers. The police said his uncle, Khajan Singh, who filed the police complaint in the matter, alleged that Sombir had been poisoned by the three brothers. The police is yet to make any arrests in the case.In the police complaint, Singh said at 7.45 pm, Sombir had made two phone calls to his cousins and said the three suspects were going to poison him. “In a video call with a cousin, Sombir was lying unconscious and the suspects said he had passed out after drinking some liquor. A few minutes later, one of the suspects told us over the phone that he had died,” said Singh in the FIR. Singh further said that previously on April 17, Sombir had gone to Jharsa to settle differences with his wife, but was assaulted with sticks by his three brothers-in-law and their friends and had to undergo treatment for a head injury. Police said Sombir was rushed to a private hospital in Sector 38 where he was declared dead on arrival. Lal Singh, in-charge police post, Jharsa, said, “The autopsy is yet to be conducted and the cause of death is yet to be ascertained. A poisonous substance was recovered from the spot. Based on the statement of the victim’s family, a case has been registered against the three brothers. No persons have been arrested so far.”A case was registered against the suspects under sections 302 (murder), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of Indian Penal Code at Sadar police station on Saturday, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-men-booked-for-killing-brother-in-law-in-jharsa/story-fCWnYi71RkRrzdIvi7xx9M.html
18-05-2020||Gurugram||Faulty FASTags will lead to double toll at Kherki-Daula plaza||The ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) on Friday stated that a vehicle without a FASTag or with a damaged one will be charged double the normal toll amount as a penalty at the Kherki-Daula toll plaza. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)also started charging commuters with faulty FASTags from May 15—the day the notification came out.The gazette notification read, “Provided further that user of the vehicle not fitted with FASTag or vehicle without valid, functional FASTag entering into FASTag lane of the Fee plazas shall pay a fee equivalent to two times of the fee applicable to that category of vehicles (sic)”.NHAI officials said that they are targeting commuters who do not have FASTags but often enter FASTag lanes and end up paying double the toll as a penalty.Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI Gurugram said, “We have started implementing the notification to charge double penalty from commuters with an invalid tag or inadequate balance and entering FASTag lanes as per the gazette notification. We are also targeting those who still use cash lanes and have not obtained FASTags yet, persuading them to obtain the same at the earliest.”Officials of the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway concessionaire Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL) said, on an average, NHAI collects ₹2 lakh in penalty daily at the Kherki Daula toll plaza.NHAI has directed the toll officials to collect double the normal toll charges if any commuter is found entering a FASTag lane without a tag or with a faulty tag.Anish John, systems manager, MCEPL, said, “We are collecting a double penalty since December when the FASTag system was started at the Kherki-Daula toll plaza. This time MoRTH has made it mandatory for the toll officials to collect double the penalty from even those who have a FASTag, but a faulty one.”Every time commuters cross a FASTag lane without a valid or non-functional tag, they have to pay double the toll amount of ₹130 at the Kherki Daula toll plaza. This eventually wastes a lot of time for the drivers of vehicles standing in the queue and increases their waiting time.Rajendra Bhati, project head, Kherki Daula toll plaza, said, “If a commuter’s FASTag account falls short of the required toll charges, they will be blacklisted. Such people will have to pay a penalty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/faulty-fastags-will-lead-to-double-toll-at-kherki-daula-plaza/story-Ek1xGq1SoiisIyw906IrtO.html

A police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said that the preliminary probe had revealed that around 9 am, the man had sent an email to his cousin brother stating that he was ending his life in his car.The police said the man was from Alwar and lived in Sector 51. They added that he used to work in an IT company and had left that job at least four months ago.In his statement to the police, the man’s cousin said, “My cousin was under stress for some time and was undergoing therapy from a psychologist. He had been restless and had not been talking much with the family members lately. Today around 1pm, I checked my email and saw that my cousin brother had sent me an email to me at 9am. In the email, he said he was in Sector 29 and was going to end his life by suffocating himself in his car.”The police said the cousin and two members of his family rushed to sector 29 and found the man sitting unconscious on the rear seat of the car which was locked from inside. They broke the windowpane of the co-driver’s seat to take out the body.“The man was rushed to a private hospital in Sushant Lok 1 where doctors declared him dead on arrival,” said the police officer.The police have initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the code of criminal procedure (CrPC). The autopsy of the body is yet to be conducted.Gurugram does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations.

The two suspects and their gang were involved in more than 200 incidents of ATM thefts, they added.The suspect arrested on Saturday was identified as Shoukat by the police. The suspect is wanted in eight states and the Haryana and Uttar Pradesh police had announced a reward of ₹50,000 on his arrest.According to the police, Shoukat is from Shikarpur village in Tauru tehsil. They said his gang had allegedly looted more than ₹14 crore in the last 10 years. The gang members used to uproot ATMs from kiosks and loot the cash, the police added.Narender Bijarnia, superintendent of police (SP), Nuh, said the police received a tip about the suspect’s movement — that he would be going towards Ghasera village to meet his some of his associates. “The investigation unit, led by inspector Vipin Kumar, laid a trap and intercepted the motorcycle the suspect was riding. Shoukat opened fire on the police team following which our personnel retaliated, and a bullet hit his right leg,” he said.The suspect was rushed to the civil hospital in Nuh, police said adding that two country-made pistols and two live cartridges were recovered from his possession.“We had arrested the leader of the gang, identified as Farookh on Friday late night in a shoot-out, but his close aide Shoukat had managed to flee from the spot. He had fled to Tauru and was on his way to meet other gang members when we received a tip on his movement and the police team surrounded him,” Bijarnia said.Shoukat was wanted in eight states and was declared a proclaimed offender in 2017 by Nuh, Gurugram, and Uttar Pradesh Police.“Earlier when police used to conduct raids in his village, the villagers would pelt stones on the police teams and have assaulted many police personnel of Gujarat, Nuh, Gurugram, and Uttar Pradesh Police. Shoukat used to hide in his village at a relative’s house, and was not arrested for the last three years,” the SP said.Police officers said the suspect was involved in more than 200 incidents wherein he along with his associates uprooted ATMs in at least eight states across the country. Bijarnia, said the suspect would get unemployed youngsters in Nuh to join the gang and rope them in for ATM thefts and robberies. Shaukat had travelled with Farookh to Gujarat, Orissa, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra to conduct ATM thefts, the police said.According to the police, the suspect was involved in cow smuggling cases before and was arrested at least seven times. After police had started arresting the people involved in smuggling cases, he gave smuggling cows and joined Farookh. He would drive to other states with his gang and steal other vehicles that were used to return to Nuh with the looted cash.The Nuh police have registered 197 cases in the last two months and have arrested as many as 155 suspects. The police said they arrested 21 most-wanted criminals, 61 proclaimed offenders, and 40 bail-jumper. Over 1,037 vehicles were impounded by the police in the same period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/200-atm-thefts-gang-leader-s-close-aid-arrested-after-another-shoot-out/story-SZ0tYfFQoHbzHnOdiEWw1L.html

Kumar, a resident of Ganga Vihar in Sector 12, had tested positive on May 15.“I got myself tested privately after a colleague had tested positive at work as I was worried about my family,” said Kumar, who works at the Punjab National Bank. He alleged that after getting the results, he tried calling all the government helplines and sought help from the Aarogya Setu application as well but received no response. On May 16, an ambulance arrived to take him to the quarantine centre, where he is currently sharing a room with five others at the facility.Kumar’s ordeal was shared by his brother-in-law, Ankit Bhardwaj, on a Twitter thread on Sunday listing all the steps taken by the family to get Kumar to a quarantine facility. He wrote that after receiving the results, the family reached out to government helplines for treatment and guidance and updated their status on Aarogya Setu application but received no response.“After over 50 calls and waiting for a whole day, finally one helpline responded,” he wrote. Bhardwaj’s tweet saw responses from Twitter handles of the district administration, which wrote that the issue has been raised with the nodal officer of the facility and that efforts were being made to resolve it on a priority basis.Kumar said that samples from the other members of his family were collected on Sunday.“I currently have no symptoms but seeing the state of the facility, I am worried that my health may worsen. I wish to complete the rest of the quarantine at home,” said the 30-year-old.After the matter was raised on the social media platform, the official handle of the Gurugram deputy commissioner of Gurugram, Amit Khatri, reached out and said: “Our officer got in touch with you with regards to this matter. Apart from making a note of the issues you raised we have also informed the nodal officer for the facilities and we will be resolving this issue on priority. You can be in touch with us over any issues that you face.”On Friday, the admin added five containment zones in the district, taking the tally to 37 with new additions to the Gurugram block.“The patient was totally asymptomatic and he was under our surveillance. We had done proper thermal screening. He has recently been shifted to ESI hospital,” said a senior health official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/corona-positive-patient-raises-concern-about-poor-response-by-health-officials/story-mhxgWjKmGQDtAlrIfWu7cI.html

The colony houses several corporate offices of the top automobile brands, workshops, service centres, along with government offices of electricity department and the industries department.The Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) is responsible for the maintenance of this colony, including the upkeep of the vacant plots, parks, roads, etc. The MCG, on the other hand, is responsible for waste collection and its disposal to a designated spot on a daily basis.“We have been noticing for past many weeks that waste is being dumped after sunset at the site in question which is just behind our association’s office. The vacant plot belongs to the HSIIDC and it is earmarked for a parking. There was no waste at the plot before the lockdown. The site has currently huge dump of wastes and we want MCG to clean it up instant (sic),” stated the letter.The industry owners also want MCG to find out why the waste is lying unattended for weeks, especially when the city is going through a severe public health crisis.“Sorry to inform you that now-a-days nobody from MCG coming to pick waste, due to that a huge waste dump has emerged. This can cause threat of spread of Covid-19 disease also, as rainy season is also approaching we want the site, which causes foul smell in the air, should be cleaned and MCG should ensure no one dumps waste here in future (sic),” stated Dharam Sagar, president of the industrial association in the letter, adding that in order to contain the spread of the disease, the civic body should look into the matter seriously.Gaurav Antil, the MCG joint commissioner, said, “I have received the complaint from the concerned association. I have issued directions to the field official to get it cleaned up by Monday.”A senior HSIIDC official, on condition of anonymity, said, “We have written to the MCG in this regard as waste at the site in question is being dumped for many months.

The suspects are placed under isolation and quarantine period of at least 14 days, and in many cases, for 28 days,” he said.The deputy commissioner further said, “We had sent the samples of 6,939 people, of which 147 had tested positive and the results of 590 are awaited.

18-05-2020||City||11 new cases in Gurugram, district tally at 204||Gurugram The district on Sunday reported 11 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), including that of one health worker. This follows the 14 new cases detected on Saturday. The total number of lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases in Gurugram now stands at 204, of which 100 patients are currently hospitalised, while 104 patients have recovered, according to the district health department’s daily bulletin on Sunday.Among Sunday’s new positive cases, one is a health worker affiliated to a hospital in Sector 10A, while one case each in Khandsa, Sector 9A and Ravi Nagar is confirmed to have been in close contact with previously confirmed positive cases.

18-05-2020||Gurugram||District admin sets up Covid care centres for asymptomatic patients in Nuh||The district administration and health department of Nuh, on Sunday, designated four institutions as Covid care establishments for treatment of asymptomatic patients. This comes after five people in the region tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19). After a 31-year-old truck driver tested positive for the virus, four of his neighbours also tested positive on Sunday morning, said officials. With this, the total number of positive cases in the district has reached 65. After the five people were tested positive from Raniyala Patakpur village of Pingwan block, the district administration sealed all the entry and exit gates and deployed more than 50 police personnel at the spot.Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Nuh, said the 31-year-old man who tested positive is a truck driver and had travelled to Bhiwadi. Due to the ongoing lockdown, he could not get regular work and he visited his relatives, friends and neighbour in search of work, from where he caught the infection. “Five of the cases, including the driver, are asymptomatic in nature and they have been shifted to Covid care setups in Nuh,” he said.“We along with the police and the district administration visited Raniyala Patakpur village and requested people not to hide their travel history and told the sarpanch to ensure that all close contacts of Covid-positive patients to remain under quarantine for 14 days,” CMO Yadav said.“We have also converted the Industrial Training Institute (ITI) buildings of Pingwan, Malabh and Indri as Covid care centres after all members of the Tablighi Jamaat were discharged. Aravalli school in Ferozepur Zirka was designated as the fourth Covid care centre in the district. Starting Sunday, we have decided to shift all the asymptomatic cases for treatment in these centres,” Vikram, deputy commissioner of Nuh.Three more institutions will be converted into Covid care centres at Salaheri, Ferozepur Namak and Palla engineering college in Nuh.Earlier the asymptomatic patients were placed under isolation in the hospitals but after the new guidelines by the ministry of home affairs(MHA), they will now be either home isolated or shifted to Covid care centres, said officials.These centres will accommodate at least 2,000 asymptomatic patients.Officials also said that samples of 197 people have been sent for testing and their results are awaited. They all are under quarantine and reports will come by Monday morning, said the CMO. A total of 65 cases have been recorded in the district so far.According to the CMO, at least 4,975 people have been put under surveillance to date, of which 84 people have returned from foreign countries and are presently in Nuh. They were traced inside different mosques in the villages of Nuh. “We had sent the samples of 4,057 people, of which 65 have tested positive and 3,795 have tested negative. Two people are currently hospitalised,” said Yadav adding that 58 people have been recovered so far in the district and there are seven active cases.Nuh, a district adjoining Gurugram, was once a hot spot zone after 45 Tablighi Jamaat attendees tested positive for the Covid-19 in the first week of April. Health officials say, after curtailing the wave of Jamaat attendees, their focus has been on drivers, who are undertaking interdistrict travel and their contacts to prevent the spread of the disease.“Since the beginning, we were following the strategy of screening and contact tracing. We did not leave anyone even if there were no symptoms and we ensured the people who returned from the Delhi Markaz of Tablighi Jamaat were also placed under quarantine and all the details of their close contacts, including family members, were noted,” said deputy commissioner Pankaj, who goes by his first name.The administration is keeping an eye on the movements of all people placed under surveillance and even those who have recovered. The areas from where the positive cases were reported have been declared as containment zones and no entry and exit are being allowed from those villages.The Nuh district administration in last week of April declared 45 villages as containment zones and 133 as buffer zones, thereby banning the entry and exit of people in these villages.After the Jamaat cases surfaced the district administration formed 289 teams consisting of health workers, police and administration. The teams conducted a detailed contact tracing of cases along with mapping all the Covid-19 epicentres and hot spots in the first week of April. Following this, teams conducted a house-to-house survey of all the villages.As part of a coordinated effort, police, district administration and health department worked in close coordination and a war room was set up in the deputy commissioner’s office in the secretariat. The health department also conducted house-to-house surveillance and covered around 2.75 lakh houses, screening 14.5 lakh persons in the district. To date, 289 teams consisting of three people and one supervisor have screened 14.5 lakh villagers. About 24 mobile medical teams have been pressed into service.“Through the survey, we identified 2,500 symptomatic patients, who were further monitored. We majorly focused on two things, keeping people with a travel history in self-quarantine and identifying those who have developed symptoms of Covid-19,” said Pankaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/district-admin-sets-up-covid-care-centres-for-asymptomatic-patients-in-nuh/story-uJDkQdPIi2yevlng98l30H.html

18-05-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 fallout: Caught at Ghazipur, home is a step too far||“I want to go back home. My husband has died there, and I need to see him one last time.” An inconsolable Sunita was at Delhi’s border with Uttar Pradesh in Ghazipur in the hope of boarding a bus back home to Sasaram city in Bihar. But the borders were shut, and there were no buses to be found. Sunita had come to visit her sister in the national Capital before the nationwide lockdown came into effect. “Someone please help me get home,” she said, sobbing.Hundreds of migrants had gathered at the Ghazipur border on Sunday, leading to shouting, chaos and cries as the UP police made sure that no migrant entered Ghaziabad. The nationwide lockdown put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19 was extended till May 31 on Sunday, which was the last day of the third phase of the restrictions. The UP government had asked the police and administration to ensure no migrant worker travelled on foot or in vehicles, after 24 people were killed in UP’s Auraiya district when the truck they were travelling on met with an accident on Saturday morning. As a result, no buses were forthcoming, nor were they allowed to cross over on foot. This resulted in lot of chaos as the migrants tried to enter Ghaziabad with the police pushing them back. A majority of the migrants were from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Among them was Sushila Devi’s family. Her four sons had managed to cross the border on Saturday night, while she, her husband, a daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren had been left behind. “We started to walk from Narela on Saturday afternoon after someone told us we can get buses to Sitapur in UP, from the Ghazipur border. My sons got to the border before we did, and managed to cross. However, the police stopped us when we tried to join them. Now they are stuck just two kilometres away. They were carrying all the money we had. We are left with nothing here. We have been requesting the police to help them get back to Delhi. We are ready to stay wherever we are told. We just want to be together,” she said. When they weren’t allowed to enter Ghaziabad, angry migrants blocked the Ghazipur main road in the evening for around 20 minutes. Nitish Tripathi, who worked in a garment factory in the area, was among those who had blocked the arterial road. He said he and his brothers wanted to walk home to Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh. “We have had no work for the last two months, and have run out of money now. Yesterday, we sold a TV and a table we had in our room to arrange money for the travel. But they are not letting us go home, and asking us to shift to a shelter. Our mother is unwell, and she needs us. We want to go home,” Tripathi said.Jasmeet Singh, deputy commissioner of police (east), said the migrants had blocked the road after being provoked by “some political leaders” who had gathered many of them at the border with assurances that they would be sent to their hometowns. “There were attempts by some migrants and party leaders to block the Ghazipur Road, but we have to convince them to leave. They are now on the side of the road, which is now clear,” Singh said. He said DTC buses would be arranged to send them to their homes in Delhi. Officers of the Ghaziabad police said they could not let migrants enter as they were on foot, and had orders to that effect. Only those with valid train tickets were to be allowed entry.Police said nearly 500 migrants had also gathered at the border on Saturday evening. Sitting under a flyover near the Ghazipur border, Rajesh Kumar Kohli was among six who arrived in Delhi from Kolkata aboard a special train. “We walked from the New Delhi Railway Station to ISBT bus stand to board a bus for Aligarh. At ISBT, someone told us that buses are only available from the borders, so we started walking to Ghazipur last night. We walked for five hours but the police said there were no buses here either. We do not know what to do. I am left with Rs 100 now,” he said.Meanwhile, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said the Delhi government will arrange trains for all migrant workers who want to return home. “We will take full care of the migrants, if they want to live here. In case they want to return to their homes, we will arrange trains for them. We won’t leave them alone in such a crisis,” he said in a tweet.Deputy chief minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia said more than 25 trains and a large number of buses have ferried over 35,000 migrant labourers to their home states from Delhi so far. “Today eight Shramik Special trains will carry around 12,000 migrant labourers to their homes states,” he tweeted. He added that it is mandatory to register to be able to board one of these trains. Meanwhile, the UP government has allowed the operation of Shramik Special trains from Ghaziabad and Noida, from where trains have been running since May 15.UP government officials on Sunday said 522 trains have arrived from other states, and another 87 were scheduled to arrive.“When these trains arrive, around 1.65 million migrant workers will arrive in UP. Around 150,000 arrived in the state on Saturday,” said Awanish Awasthi, additional chief secretary (home), Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/for-migrants-caught-at-ghazipur-border-home-is-a-step-too-far/story-0mMM1TnN4QuIUGo1XBfSNN.html
18-05-2020||Gurugram||GMDA, MCG infra projects hit by shortage of manpower||The progress of several civic projects of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has been impacted by a shortage of manpower, said officials on Sunday.The worst-affected projects include the Huda City Centre underpass, the multilevel parking at Sadar Bazar, flyovers at Shankar Chowk and Basai Chowk.Despite receiving the permission to resume work on April 21, these projects have either completely come to a standstill or are progressing at a snail’s pace due to the labour shortage.Last week, the MCG’s engineering wing had prepared a list of projects that have not been started within 15 days of allotment of the work order and had accordingly started levying fines on contractors for it. It was only then that officials discovered that many contractors were unable to start work due to a severe shortage of manpower.“In the projects that were allotted prior to the lockdown, all executive engineers have been directed to levy penalties on contractors. In the projects that were allotted since the lockdown, we have received many replies from contractors saying they are low on manpower as they are struggling to find daily wagers amid the coronavirus crisis. We are reviewing such replies on a case-to-case basis and are directing the contractors to submit an application asking for an extension of the deadline,” said Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG.At the Sadar Bazar multilevel parking, which was allotted prior to the enforcement of the national lockdown on March 25, excavation work has started. However, MCG officials privy to the matter said the work has not progressed since then.“The contractor has not been able to progress as he has not been able to find any manpower since then. Most of the workers at the site were migrant workers who have now returned home. It is likely to take another two weeks for the work to resume,” said an MCG official privy to the matter.Due to shortage in manpower, the work on the under-construction flyover at Basai Chowk is progressing at a very slow rate, said GMDA officials.“We have 15 to 20 daily wage earners at the site but we need at least 50 workers to put the work in full gear. There is a huge manpower shortage as most of our workers were migrants who have either left for their homes in other states and are waiting for their turn to be sent back by their respective state governments. In such a situation, we cannot expect our contractor to complete the project as per the schedule,” said a GMDA official familiar with the matter.GMDA’s underpass work at Huda City Centre is also progressing at a slow pace because of unavailability of daily wage workers, while the work at the Shankar Chowk flyover has not restarted at all due to acute shortage of manpower.“Migration of daily wage workers is happening at a big scale and most migrant workers have left for their respective home states. Their migration, along with the fear associated with the pandemic, has affected several ongoing projects. Work on the Basai Chowk flyover and the underpass at Huda City Centre will take time to resume in full gear until daily wage workers are available again. Manpower shortage will hence delay these projects,” said VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO), GMDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-mcg-infra-projects-hit-by-shortage-of-manpower/story-ooQmQAwxuAjSZJiDseAz5L.html
18-05-2020||Delhi||AAP says Centre responsible for plight of migrants, BJP hits back||The Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) on Sunday criticised the policies of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government holding it responsible for the plight of stranded migrants thousands of whom were walking hundreds of kilometres to reach their towns and villages as only limited inter-state transport is allowed in the wake of the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19.“After 1947, maybe this is the first time when India is witnessing such a huge exodus of the poor migrant labourers. Lakhs of migrant labourers are leaving big cities and travelling thousands of kilometres to reach their home states. The recent situation has devastated their lives, ruined their livelihood and they are left with nothing,” said AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha in a press statement. He added, “The picture is the same across the country as lakhs of poor migrant labourers are trying to reach their home states. Every day they are facing atrocities, their rights are violated and the BJP is responsible for this situation.”“Today, the BJP government has sent luxury flights to bring back the rich people who were stuck abroad. The same treatment was given to various rich businessmen. It is good that they have done such things but it is unfortunate that the BJP has done nothing for these poor migrant labourers,” said Chadha.He further said, “These poor migrant labourers are the real makers of India. They leave their home states and travel to the metro cities to earn bread and butter. The kind of atrocities they are facing along with the negligence from the BJP government is unacceptable,” said Chadha, who is also the MLA from Rajendra Nagar.BJP MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, also the leader of opposition in the Delhi assembly, hit back at the AAP’s allegations,.“The Centre’s decision to announce lockdown was critical to contain the spread of Covid-19, which even Delhi CM had welcomed. It is the state government’s responsibility to provide food and shelter to the migrant population. People want to move out of Delhi as the state government is unable to ensure proper distribution of ration to them. Their web portal where migrants could register was not working for a few days. The Centre has said it will provide trains. The government should say when their request for trains was denied by the Centre before levelling such allegations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-responsible-for-the-plight-of-migrant-workers-says-aap/story-JhhaKV0tIcGb1cFsB9FM0M.html

The police had said the accused persons allegedly asked for ₹1.25 lakh from 53 migrant workers, which included women and children, to ferry them to Malda district in West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-men-held-for-trying-to-ferry-passengers-to-jharkhand/story-ZvSVm2SmOnqJNK1DsZynVI.html
18-05-2020||Gurugram||Status quo until Gurugram draws up rules for extended lockdown||The Haryana government is likely to come out with a fresh bunch for guidelines for lockdown 4.0 on Monday, post which the Gurugram district administration will release its own set of lockdown rules.Officials said that till the time the new rules are issued by the district, all the restrictions in place for lockdown 3.0 will continue to be in place.The Union home ministry on Sunday had extended the ongoing lockdown till May 31, while giving certain relaxations, to check the spread of Covid-19 pandemic.“Till fresh guidelines are issued by state government, there will be a status quo,” said a district administration spokesperson.Officials, however, said that with new relaxations, it is possible that business and economic activity will be able to resume operations in green and orange zones, while restrictions will remain in force in only the containment zones. Shops, HSVP markets, cabs and autos have been allowed to start operating while observing proper social distancing norms, under restricted timings. Shops selling non-essential commodities will be allowed to open twice a week in the city.Commercial establishments and industrial units have also been allowed to operate with 33 per cent work force in the Gurugram-Manesar industrial and urban complex. As per the district administration, 1,330 industrial and commercial establishments had been allowed to resume operations till May 11, in which over one lakh workers were employed.In another significant development, the Union ministry of home affairs has given powers to the state governments to decide upon the Red, Green and Orange zones as per the number of Covid-19 cases. Also the states have been allowed to decide on inter-state and intra-state movement of private vehicles and buses, based on mutual consent of two states. Restrictions, however, remain on air travel, operations of rail and metro trains as per the new directions. Educational institutions like schools, colleges and universities shall continue to remain closed till further orders. Public places like shopping malls, cinema halls, restaurants, hotels shall also remain closed. The government has also continued the ban on all religious gatherings and congregations.The restrictions imposed on movement of people from 7pm to 7 am shall continue to be in place, said the guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/status-quo-until-gurugram-draws-up-rules-for-extended-lockdown/story-s0rDrfR4nioezj6ANsbtSK.html
18-05-2020||Delhi||AIIMS OPD services to resume on May 20||After a hiatus of nearly two months, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is planning to restart its out-patient clinics on Wednesday with restricted consultations, according to the hospital administration.The clinics were shut on March 24, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19). Before that, at least 10,000 patients visited the OPD clinics each day, with around 40% of the patients arriving from other parts of the country.The OPD services were stopped on March 24, just a few days after the second phase of the services were moved to a new, spacious block. Eight clinical departments, including pulmonary medicine, rheumatology, and radiology, were moved to the new Rajkumari Amrit Kaur OPD block in the Masjid Moth facility on April 16. The first phase of the services was moved to the new block earlier this year in February.“We are planning to restart the out-patient clinics sometime this week. The number of people who will be allowed in the clinics every day will be restricted to maintain social distancing. All the departments will open up the clinics in a phased manner, beginning this week,” Dr DK Sharma, the medical superintendent of the hospital, said.According to doctors of the hospital, the clinics are likely to resume services on Wednesday.The hospital has been contemplating restarting the services from April-end, however, taking care of Covid-19 patients is drawing on most of the hospital’s manpower and resources.With the hospital treating Covid-19 patients in its trauma centre on Ring Road and the cancer centre in Jhajjar, the main hospital has been handling emergency services, including the emergent and semi-emergent surgeries. Three operating theatres have been running round-the-clock in the hospital. The hospital has admitted at least 447 Covid-19 patients.The doctors are, however, providing teleconsultation to patients who registered with them at the beginning of April.Along with OPD, surgical services are also likely to be scaled up. “Several patients who come to our OPD need admission and surgeries, hence we need to open up these services too,” Dr Sharma said.AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria had earlier told HT that simple surgeries such as gall stone removal and hernia will be started in the first phase as they require fewer days of hospital admission and minimal use of ventilators.Earlier this month, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had asked Union health minister Harsh Vardhan to intervene to scale up non-Covid-19 services at the four Central government hospitals. He had requested the minister to covert one of the hospitals completely into a Covid centre and let the others resume normal services.“I request that the central government dedicate one of its hospitals in Delhi for the treatment of Covid-19 patients and the others for non-Covid treatment. There have been cases of patients being refused routine treatment. Also, AllMS has taken a good step and dedicated the trauma centre and the cancer centre in Jhajjar to the treatment of Covid-19 patients but all its other services have been stopped. I urge you to restart the other facilities for non-Covid patients,” Jain had said in the meeting held in the first week of May.While AIIMS had shut its OPD services completely, the other three central hospitals – Dr Ram Manohar Lohia, Safdarjung, and Lady Hardinge Medical College – had restricted their out-patient clinics and stopped routine surgeries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aiims-opd-clinics-to-open-with-restricted-access-from-wednesday/story-1tCR8BqHfq4ngkYINpgKrN.html
18-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi cases near 10,000 mark, 19 more deaths take Covid-19 toll to 148||Delhi recorded 422 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Sunday, taking the city’s tally to 9,755, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government. With almost 400 cases being recorded in the national capital each day for the past four days, the total number of infections is likely to cross the 10,000 mark on Monday.Nineteen more deaths were recorded in Delhi, taking the city’s toll of Covid-19 fatalities to 148. All these deaths did not, however, take place in the past 24 hours and were cleared from a backlog of probable cases by the Death Audit Committee.This is the second-highest number of deaths that have been recorded in a day since 20 deaths were recorded on May 13.“These deaths did not happen in the last 24 hours; the nineteen deaths for which summaries have come in have been recorded. It is difficult to get the reports the same day. It takes a couple of days to get the report. The backlog has almost been cleared, there will be additions like this once or twice more,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a media interaction on Sunday.“Many of the cases are coming from hospital, BSF, CISF. There have been many cases from the police department. There are many cases of health care workers also. Many patients admitted to the hospitals have also tested positive. Right now, most of the cases are coming from the existing containment zones, we will increase the containment zones as and when needed,” said Jain.This puts Delhi’s mortality rate at 1.5%, still among the lowest in the country.All designated Covid-19 hospitals – government and private -- have now been directed to submit their death reports each day by 5pm to prevent any backlog and erroneous reporting. A three-member death audit committee goes through the case sheets, patient records and investigations, and death summary to include the deaths in the toll every day at 5:30 pm. The step was taken after a discrepancy was detected in the number of cases recorded in the health bulletin and those reported by hospitals. Only the deaths where the “primary cause” is Covid-19 will be recorded in the bulletin.“A person may have tested positive for the infection, but if their chest X-Ray is clean, the arterial blood gas does not show any signs of acidosis, and their oxygen saturation is normal then clearly Covid-19 isn’t the cause of death,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department, on condition of anonymity.The 9,755 cases have been recorded in less than three months since the first case was reported in the city on March 2. The first person to be infected by he disease in the city was a 45-year-old resident of east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar who had returned from Italy.So far, 95,656 cases have been recorded in the country, with Delhi accounting for 10% of the cases. The highest number of cases have been recorded in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, followed by Delhi.The first spike in cases of the highly infectious disease was reported in the city in early April after people who attended a congregation in the headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic missionary group, in Nizamuddin Basti started testing positive for the infection. As per Delhi government data, 1,080 of the over 2,300 people who were evacuated from the building tested positive for Covid-19.The highest number of cases recorded during this first spike was on April 13 when 356 cases had been recorded in a single day. Of these, 325 were in those evacuated from Nizamuddin, the data showed.The number of cases started shooting up this month, with Delhi breaching the highest single-day spike in numbers four times in May -- 427 cases were recorded on May 3, 428 on May 6, 448 on May 7, and 472 cases were recorded on Thursday, May 14. From just over 3,500 Covid-19 cases recorded till April-end, the numbers have shot up by over 6,000 cases being recorded in the city in just 15 days.Some of this is owing to laboratories across the city rushing to give Covid-19 reports with 24 hours of collecting the samples in compliance with orders by the Delhi government and the high court. Since mid-January when screening for Covid-19 began in the country, Delhi has tested 135,791 samples. There are 13 government and 15 private laboratories in the city performing the tests.Many district authorities also pointed out that hospitals were becoming hotspots for infections with several healthcare workers, their family members, and patients visiting hospitals also testing positive for the disease. So far, over 500 healthcare workers across the city have tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-set-to-cross-10-000-cases-on-monday-covid-19-death-toll-at-148/story-zerLlxRYNNzQYRw69ATJEI.html
18-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi Congress chief arrested for violating lockdown, visiting Ghazipur||The Delhi Police on Sunday arrested Delhi Congress president Anil Chaudhary for allegedly violating lockdown orders. He was later released on bail. According to the police, Chaudhary was asked to remain home and refrain from visiting the Ghazipur border in east Delhi, but he is alleged to have mobilised migrant workers and visited the spot.The deputy commissioner of police (east), Jasmeet Singh, said Chaudhary was booked under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code for violating the provisions of the lockdown.Chaudhary said he was at Ghazipur to help migrant workers with food and water. “If this is the crime that I am being booked for, then all the Congress workers and I will keep committing this crime,” he said.A senior police officer, who did not want to be named, said Chaudhary and his workers had visited Ghazipur on Saturday night, after which the gathering of migrant labourers swelled suddenly. Many of them had also hidden in trucks and tempos arriving at the Ghazipur vegetable market, according to the officer.“After a lot of efforts overnight, we managed to disperse the crowd and the situation was controlled. There were allegations that many migrant workers were being transported across Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border with the help of people with links to political parties. As a precautionary measure, we placed Chaudhary under preventive detention and asked him not to visit the area until the situation is completely under control,” the officer said.Chaudhary said that on Sunday morning, a team of police officials came to his house and detained him without any reason. “They kept asking me why I went to the Ghazipur border yesterday (Saturday). I was there with some Congress workers to try to help the migrant labourers there with food and water. We saw that one of the women there was pregnant and went into labour, and our workers took her to Dr Hedgewar Arogya Sansthan, which was nearby,” said Chaudhary.He said, “We have been working to help the migrant labourers for several weeks now. We have also converted our state unit office into a shelter facility for them.”The Delhi Congress lashed out at the police and the Central government for taking action against those helping the poor during the ongoing crisis. “This (helping the migrant labourers) is the job that the government should be doing. But they are not even allowing other people to help them. This is the time when the migrant workers need our help and support. Help from anywhere should be accepted and appreciated. Instead of doing that, you are sending the police after them,” said Abhishek Dutt, vice-president of the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee.The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) national secretary, RP Singh, said that help from all quarters is welcome, but people have to follow the law. “If they want to help people, then they should. But they should take necessary permission from the subdivisional magistrate. There is no point blaming the Centre or the police, as law has been put in place to fight the contagious disease. Police officials are just following the law. The Congress is unnecessarily politicising the issue. The present rules in Delhi have the approval of the state government, which is not under the BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-congress-chief-arrested-for-violating-lockdown-visiting-ghazipur/story-LoAaJMTxDCBsFTXDmhr44J.html
18-05-2020||Delhi||Lockdown 4.0: Delhi can now define its own ‘red zones’||The Centre on Sunday allowed state governments to classify and demarcate their own red, orange and green zones --- areas specified as per their vulnerability and presence of Covid-19 cases, a key demand of the Delhi government since the entire city was under the ‘red zone’. Major relaxations that were announced by the Centre amid the nationwide lockdown were not applicable to the red zones, crippling Delhi’s efforts to jump start economic and business activity. The Union home ministry in its guidelines to states issued for the fourth version of the lockdown, which will stay in effect till May 31, has fixed broad rules for the states on which specific rules can be framed. The Delhi government will notify its relaxations and guidelines on Monday. Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicA red zone is an area where there are more than 10 Sars-Cov-2 positive cases. A red zones can have one or many containment zones to limit the spread of the cases. As on Sunday, Delhi had 73 containment zones. On May 2, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had first raised the demand for the Centre to reconsider the demarcation of ‘red zones’, which, until Sunday, was being done on the basis of districts, across the country.“All the 11 districts of Delhi are in the red zone as per the Centre’s rule, meaning that the reported Covid-19 cases in each district is 10 or more. Because of this parameter, Delhi, being such a small city, will never be able to get out of the red zone. No economic activity will be able to restart because of this. This rule needs to change and should either be on the basis of containment zones or wards,” Kejriwal had said on May 2. Also Read: States to fix zones in lockdown 4.0On Sunday, the Centre gave states and Union Territories a free hand to designate areas into red, green and orange zones. “With red and orange zones, containment zones and buffer zones will be demarcated by the district authorities, after taking into consideration the guidelines issued by the minister of health and family welfare (MoHFW),” the order stated. Later, the MoFHW issued a letter to all states laying out the parameters for identifying such zones. “States may categorise districts/municipal corporations as red/orange/green zones. States may, however, also choose to categorise a sub-division/ward or any other appropriate administrative unit as red/orange/green zone after detailed analysis at their end, duly taking into consideration the geographical spread of cases, contacts and the zone of influence terms of disease spread,” read the letter written by Preeti Sudan, secretary, MoFW. Also Read: AIIMS OPD clinics to open with restricted access from WednesdayThe Delhi government, responding to the guidelines, said, “Broadly, the Centre’s guidelines are in the right direction of opening up the economy and leaving it to states to work out the details. We have always been saying that we all will now have to learn to live with corona. We used the last two-month lockdown period to prepare ourselves for dealing with corona by improving necessary logistics and health infra. We do expect a slight increase in cases when the economy reopens and Delhi is prepared to deal with it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lockdown-4-0-delhi-can-now-define-its-own-red-zones/story-dbJiI8GWr2BbUB12DYKmlL.html
18-05-2020||Delhi||Restoring Delhi’s supply chain main concern of traders||Traders in Delhi have welcomed the Centre’s decision to allow markets to open in the fourth phase of the lockdown -- from May 17 to May 31 -- announced on Sunday, saying businesses hit by the restrictions will finally pick up in the Capital. The Union home ministry on Sunday announced the extension of the nationwide lockdown till May 31 and issued broad guidelines for the states on the relaxations that could be provided during the period. The Delhi government will issue a final list of relaxations, based on the Centre’s recommendations, on Monday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet. “Delhi govt will prepare the detailed plan for Delhi based on the Centre’s guidelines and announce it tomorrow,” Kejriwal tweeted. Delhi govt will prepare the detailed plan for Delhi based on the Centre's guidelines and announce it tomorrow https://t.co/eBfrLKUpP9Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicWhile manufacturing units were allowed to operate in the city from May 3, production has not been at full scale due to the imbalance between demand and supply as markets remained shut, according to industrial associations. They say that only 25-40% of industries had resumed work.Last week, the Delhi government had suggested an odd-even scheme for markets in its proposal to the Centre on relaxations for the fourth phase of the lockdown. The Delhi government is likely to release its guidelines for markets on Monday.Brijesh Goyal, the convener of the Aam Aadmi Party’s trade wing and national convener of the Chamber of Trade and Industry, said, “The government is in the process of finalising the guidelines for markets, now that the Centre has given its go-ahead.”Malls are not likely to be permitted to open in Delhi till May 31, as the Centre did not agree to the Delhi government’s proposal of allowing 33% of the shops to open every day. However, the relaxations for stand-alone and neighbourhood shop will continue, a senior government official said.However, traders’ associations in Delhi are divided over the odd-even proposal and also on the issue of whether markets should open.Also Read: Economic package will have multiplier effect: Nirmala SitharamanPraveen Khandelwal, secretary-general, the Confederation of All India Traders, said the opening of markets will restore the demand and supply balance, but the odd-even formula won’t be effective because traders are dependent upon other traders for exchange and purchase of goods. In a press statement, he suggested staggered timings for shops.Members of the traders’ association in Chandni Chowk said a final decision will be taken tomorrow, but they would prefer to remain shut till May 31, due to the market’s proximity to a containment zone.Manufactures said that the opening of markets is essential for demand to pick up. Lack of demand, shortage of raw material, closure of wholesale markets, unavailability of transport and reduced labour availability have hampered production.Also Read: Centre’s relaxations set to awaken Delhi from its two-month slumberAshish Garg, secretary of Narela Industrial Complex Welfare association, said, “Opening our industrial units have no meaning when there is no demand. All businesses, including wholesale, small traders, small-scale industries etc, in the supply chain have to be up and running for economic activity to revive, as we all are inter-dependent.”The continuous migration of labour force to their home states has compounded the problem, say factory owners. “With the labour force, especially unskilled labour, leaving the city, it will become difficult to restart businesses. There is even a shortage of skilled labour and it is difficult to find replacements for them,” said Rakesh Sachdeva, the president of Naraina Industrial Area Phase 1 and 2.Rajesh Garg, the secretary of the Indian Council for Trade and Industries, who owns a factory in Narela, said the government needs to draft a long-term policy to revive businesses. “Coronavirus disease will not vanish in a month or two. The Centre and state governments should come up with a long-term policy,” said Rajesh Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lockdown-4-0-delhi-traders-welcome-centre-s-decision-to-open-markets/story-PghBpDNDd9M3pEgtLt7cgM.html
18-05-2020||Delhi||Buses, autos and cabs likely to resume; Metro shut till May 31||The Centre on Sunday said that state governments may allow the operation of public buses, auto-rickshaws and private cabs during the fourth phase of the nationwide lockdown till May 31. However Metro services will remain shut, as per the guidelines to the states issued by the Union home ministry on Sunday. The Delhi government will come up with an exhaustive list of what is allowed and what is not, based on the Centre’s guidelines, on Monday. As per the MHA guidelines, the states may also allow inter-state passenger vehicles and buses, provided the governments concerned agree upon it. This could help thousands of migrant workers, who were stuck in the national Capital despite trying to reach their home towns over the last few weeks, and those who have not been able to cross the borders.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“Inter-state movement of passenger vehicles and buses, with mutual consent of the state/UT (Union Territory) involved will be allowed. Intra-state movement of passenger vehicles and buses will also be permitted, as decided by the states and UT,” the order issued by the union ministry of home affairs read.Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot said that the Delhi government had, in its list of recommendations to the Centre, said that they were prepared to resume public transport services in the city, with safety precautions in place to protect against the Covid-19 infection.Also Read: Lockdown 4.0: Delhi can now define its own ‘red zones’“The Delhi government will issue orders in this regard on Monday. However, I have had a detailed meeting with the top government officials and transport infrastructure experts to discuss a standard operation procedure (SOP) for safe operations.

Our helpline service 155370 shall also not be available,” the DMRC said in a statement on Sunday. While the Centre issued these relaxations, it has also allowed state governments to impose stricter lockdown rules at their discretion. This means that the public buses will ply in the city, but with passenger restrictions, Delhi government officials said.Also Read: 550 districts in India have Covid-19 cases; many in rural areas“We are waiting for a final order from the state government, but buses are all set to be allowed to ply with not more than 20 passengers at a time.

In private cabs, including app-based cab aggregator services such as Ola and Uber, only two passengers besides the driver are allowed, and auto-rickshaw drivers were allowed to ply with only one passenger.Delhi’s cab driver associations, welcoming the possible relaxations, said the government must also ensure a mechanism to ensure passengers are not symptomatic. “There should be some mechanism like a health certificate that the passenger needs to show before he/she is allowed to board a cab. The health of the drivers is also at stake,” said Sanjay Samrat, Delhi Taxi Tourist Transporters’ Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lockdown-4-0-buses-autos-and-cabs-likely-to-start-metro-to-stay-shut/story-juVA60U1JX3Dgh1ZL6bPzJ.html
18-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi to put out own lockdown 4.0 guidelines today: CM Kejriwal||The Delhi government will announce on Monday what citizens can and cannot do in the national capital, officials said on Sunday after the Union government significantly eased some of the curbs in force since March 25, when the country was put under a lockdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The rules for the next phase of the lockdown announced by the centre are the minimum restrictions states and union territories must follow, although they are allowed to roll out stricter measures if they need to. The relaxation was precipitated by a sharp drop in earnings of businesses as well as individuals. “The Centre’s guidelines are largely in line with the proposal sent by the Delhi government, based on the suggestions of lakhs of Delhiites. We have used the lockdown period to prepare our healthcare system if corona cases increase, but it is now time to relax the restrictions to some extent,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet, minutes after the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) issued the guidelines on Sunday. According to officials who asked not to be named, except for the 73 containment zones in the capital, there will be a significant increase in permitted activities in line with Centre’s guidelines. Some of these could include the return of buses, cabs, auto-rickshaws and lead to the reopening of markets, sports complexes, industries and offices. These were part of relaxations that Delhi suggested to the Union government in a letter written by the CM to the Prime Minister on Thursday. Some of the other recommendations by the Delhi government, such as resuming Delhi Metro services, reducing the night curfew to 9pm-5am and reopening some shops in shopping malls, were not part of the Union government guidelines – which means they cannot be implemented. Some of the other rules issued on Sunday, however, suggested more relaxations could be given in some other areas – such as allowing spas, salon or barber shops to reopen. “Details, such as how many passengers should be allowed in a bus, taxi, a private car or two-wheeler, how markets should operate and the number of people allowed to return to private offices, are being finalised. Since there are a lot of relaxations, the order by the Delhi government will have a lot of finer details to avoid any confusion,” said a senior government official, on the condition of anonymity. Delhi recommended that only 50% of staff be allowed to return to offices, while the guidelines issued by the Union home ministry made no mention of such a restriction. In the case of public transport, the Delhi government suggested single-passenger restriction for auto-rickshaws and cycle-rickshaws, and a limit of 20 passengers in buses. The official quoted above said this is likely to be included in Delhi’s rules. The capital’s administration will also take a call on whether e-commerce companies should be allowed to deliver non-essential items in areas outside of containment zones, a decision the Centre has left to states. So far, only essential items are allowed to be delivered by e-commerce companies such as Amazon and Flipkart. A second senior government official, who asked not to be named, said allowing markets to operate and relaxing the restrictions for industries and construction activities is going to help the state exchequer in increasing revenue generation. Due to the lockdown, Delhi government’s revenue collection for the month of April dropped by 90%. Against a projected generation of Rs 4,000 crore, Delhi earned only around Rs 400 crore. An official in the finance department said in the current scenario, the Delhi government will have no money to disburse salaries to its employees after July. “Not wearing a mask is likely to attract a strict fine. Besides, all employees also must wear masks, and downloading the Aarogya Setu mobile application will be emphasised upon,” the second government official added, detailing more rules that may be different from the Union government’s. The Delhi Development Authority, which runs a number of sports complexes (Siri Fort, Chilla Sports Complex, Yamuna Sports Complex, etc) in the city, said that a decision regarding opening sports complexes – which has been allowed by Centre -- will be taken based on activities allowed by the Delhi government. Experts said the relaxations will help people cope with the “vast sufferings” they have undergone. “There is definitely going to be a spike with the relaxations, but it will also ease a bit of the vast sufferings of the people, especially when there is no clear or major direct relief given by the Centre to the states and more so to a Union Territory like Delhi. We imposed the most stringent lockdown at a time when almost every other country went through a gradual lockdown. As a result, the economic crisis in India has reached a point where we are having to relax the lockdown when the number of infections is peaking,” said Jayati Ghosh, a professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-to-issue-its-own-rules-for-lockdown-4-0-on-monday/story-XW8UCLd5E3lhcsjBSXDbGM.html
18-05-2020||Noida||Going back home is not an option for all migrants||Even as the district administration and state government are making arrangements for migrants to go back to their home states, not all of them are willing to uproot their lives, despite facing several troubles over the past two months.To tackle the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had first announced a nationwide lockdown on March 24, which, in its fourth phase, has now been extended till May 31. However, soon after the lockdown, the entire country witnessed large-scale migrant movement across the country. Following this, the state government made several travel arrangements for those willing to go back home, including special trains and roadways buses.Most migrants in the city are facing large-scale unemployment and are dependent on either the government or individual sources for essentials like food. However, there are a few migrants here who are not willing to go back home.“I am being paid twice my salary this month. I can use the additional money to send back home to Bihar. Had I left, who knows if I would have even found a job again when I returned,” Pramod Jha, a security guard at a high-rise in Sector 137, said.He said that the staff is staying in the society and though he has a 10-year-old son who is staying in Gejha village with relatives, the extra money is helping them—that would not have been possible had he gone back home.Some believe that with lockdown norms starting to be relaxed, unemployment will no longer be an issue.“I was ready to return to work when domestic help was allowed. I even asked one of my employers, but their society had decided to wait before letting us resume work. But hopefully, that will change soon and I can start working. Our whole lives are here now. My kids go to school in Noida and even though it would have been more comfortable to go back home where most of our family live, I don’t want to lose my work here. There is no guarantee that by the time we return, my employers won’t find other maids,” Sarita from Jharkhand, who works as domestic help, said.With construction activities and industries gradually resuming work, daily wage labourers also feel that their situation will change soon.“We returned from Bihar only a few days before the lockdown. I used to work as domestic help but due to a lack of work, I started working at a construction site. For two months during the lockdown, I was without work or money, completely dependent on others for ration. Our contractor returned home, leaving me and several others high and dry. But a few days ago, I got a call from a society in Sector 77. They asked me to start working there. If I start earning, I can resume sending money back home. In the beginning, I wanted to go home, but if I go back to Bihar, I will not have enough money,” Parveena, a daily wage earner, said.For most migrants choosing to continue to stay, the decision is monetary.At the onset of the lockdown when it wasn’t clear whether the migrants would be able to go back home, Manoj, a rickshaw puller, and his wife had used their meagre savings to invest in fruits and vegetables which they purchase from the Sector 88 mandi and bring to sell around high-rises in the city in his rickshaw.“Even if we wanted to go back home, we cannot because all our money is now tied up in the rickshaw and the produce we sell. Nobody will buy my rickshaw during this time and the only way to sell it will be at a loss. My brothers and parents are back home but now we have to stay here,” Manoj said.However, despite all these reasons, hundreds of migrants are crossing the border looking for ways to reach home.“We are plying at least five buses today itself to ferry these migrants from the borders to shelter homes where arrangements have been made to take those from various UP districts to their homes. More roadways buses have been requested and soon those from out of the state will also be able to leave,” deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Sankalp Sharma, said.The administration has also released a link where migrants willing to go back home can register themselves. On Saturday, five trains had departed from Gautam Budh Nagar for various districts in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/going-back-home-is-not-an-option-for-all-migrants/story-mX4kjWsT30YM9DmRQKygXO.html

18-05-2020||Noida||Mercury may touch 44 degrees Celsius later this week||With the withdrawal of back-to-back western disturbances, weather analysts expect the mercury to rise by three to four degrees in the next three days bringing heatwave like conditions to the national capital region.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the western disturbance — a phenomenon that causes rains and thunder activities in the region—withdrawing, as of Sunday night, temperatures are all set to witness a sharp rise. The mercury levels are expected to rise from Tuesday, and the maximum temperatures may reach 43 to 44 degrees Celsius between May 21 and 23.“Until Sunday, the average temperature for the region has been around 40 degrees in the last few days. While there was a possibility of light rains in some parts of Delhi on Sunday, the adjoining region of western Uttar Pradesh, which includes Noida and Ghaziabad, was almost dry. From Monday, the sky will be clear giving way to vertical sun rays that cause more heating,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.He said while no heatwaves have been forecasted yet, rise in mercury levels is on the cards.“For heatwaves to happen, the maximum temperature must be above 44.3 degrees Celsius. From the current trend we can establish that the maximum temperature could go up to 43 to 44 degrees Celsius this week,” said Srivastava.On Sunday, the maximum temperature was recorded at 40.5 degrees Celsius and the minimum was at 23.6 degrees Celsius, same as a day before.On Monday, the maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to hover around 41 and 23.6 degrees Celsius respectively.“There are possibilities of very light rain in the region on Wednesday, but that would not have much effect on the maximum temperature. The sharp rise in temperature in the region would lead to heatwaves-like conditions,” said Mahesh Palawat, director, private weather forecasting agency Skymet.Palawat also pointed out that while heatwaves usually hit the region by April and episodes of intense heatwaves are witnessed around mid-May, the frequent western disturbances this year saved the region from the heatwaves until now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/mercury-may-touch-44-degrees-celsius-later-this-week/story-B7KYj18vgvk9y25OVsnnxJ.html

18-05-2020||Pune||New ‘highway’ market emerges after APMC shutdown in Pune||After the Pune agricultural produce market committee (APMC) shut down operations two weeks ago, a new market has emerged with farmers bringing in goods from outside Pune and striking deals with local retailers on the highway outside city limits. Trucks from out of town arrive and park on the highway where local retailers from the Pune transfer the goods to their tempos and return back to the city. Kiran Waghmare, a farmer from Phaltan sells potatoes and onions to local retailers on the Katraj – Dehu road bypass highway. “It had become difficult to sell our goods after the APMC market was closed down in Pune, and also the police were not allowing us to come inside the city limits. So most of the farmers decided not to enter the city and wait on the highways to sell our goods. Accordingly, from the last 10 days we stand on the bypass highway, contact our regular retailers in the city and sell our goods. It has made our transactions very easy and without disturbance to the rules and regulations of the lockdown,” Waghmare said. Another vegetable trader from Kolhapur, Aditya Mohite said, “Farmers are cultivating large number of vegetables across the state but are not able to sell the goods in Pune and Mumbai due to shut down of APMC markets. So what we decided is to not go inside the city, park our vegetable trucks on the highways and sell our goods.”According to Mohite, traders collect vegetable goods from farmers in their district, load it in one truck and then bring it to Pune on the bypass highway. “Our truck reaches the designated spot on the highway early morning around 5am, the retailers in Pune bring their tempos, purchase the vegetables and go back,” Mohite said. A local city retailer, Sameer Chavan who regularly buys vegetables and fruits from these trucks on the highways said the shutdown of APMC has resulted in a shutdown of Market yard which has forced retailers to buy goods on the highway. “The rates compared to the regular rates at the APMC are a bit high around 10 to 15 per cent more but as we don’t have any option we buy the vegetables. This certainly effects on the common public, as we also sell the vegetables at higher rates,” Chavan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/new-highway-market-emerges-after-apmc-shutdown-in-pune/story-xXauOdzBX4RWtkhL4vD0TN.html

18-05-2020||Pune||With no shows for three months, circus troupes in dire straits in Pune||An empty tent is a circus group’s worst nightmare but the nationwide lockdown due to the Covid-19 has compounded the problems of an already struggling business, said Umesh Aagashe, proprietor of Great Bharat Circus in Pune.Every year, circus tents come up in open spaces in the city and are a top draw for young and old alike. However, with circus business and its artistes reeling under crisis of poor footfalls and the given the current circumstances, the Great Bharat Circus and Rambo Circus have discontinued the shows. They are hoping to resume the shows in September or October.According to these circus companies, business post lockdown will be completely unviable, which may pose major challenge for hundreds of people and animals part of troops.The Great Bharat Circus, which has put up the tents near Wagholi in Kesanand Phata has been affected financially. The residents of Wagholi have started to raise funds for the crew.Suraj Kumar Yadav who has been entertaining the crowd with his antics as a clown for the past five years with The Great Bharat Circus and is apprehensive when the circus will begin again. “We are getting food from the residents but that is not enough. The animals are getting enough animal fodder donated by people, but the circus owners are paying for milk and bread for dogs. What we need is support from the government, for soon it will be monsoon and we will be stuck with no work. We are hoping to see some relief by September or October, otherwise we will not survive.”The 40-year-old The Great Bharat Circus was bought on contract by Umesh Aagashe two years ago. “The circus has a crew of 62 artistes and supporting staff with 24 animals including dogs, horses, camels and birds. We have not had a show since three months. There has not been a single Covid case in the troupe. We are all living in the circus premise and are maintaining social distance,” he said.“We are facing an uncertain future and are in dire need of funds. Usually the daily expense of a circus is Rs 60,000-70,000 when we have performances. I haven’t paid any salary to my artistes since March. They have family and children to support,” said Aagashe.Aagashe said that the artistes have marriages within the clan and the children are sent to boarding schools for education. “None of my artistes have homes to go to and the circus is their family. If the government doesn’t help us, we will have no future circus performances,” he said.According to the Sujeet Dilip, member of Indian Circus Federation and owner of Rambo Circus, the days ahead will be even more difficult.“We used to be a team of 40 circuses from India but are now down to 12 circus troops. We were in talks with the foreign circus owners to create new performances; however, we were hit by the pandemic. We are trying to manage with help of NGOs who are donating food and ration,” said Dilip.Rambo circus is stranded in Airoli, Navi Mumbai and is getting support from the local corporators. “If the government allows circuses to begin after lockdown, where social distancing can be maintained, then it can help sustain this fading world of live entertainment,” said Dilip.Anil Satav, a member of the Wagholi gram panchayat, who reached out to The Great Bharat Circus said, “Jijamata Bank donated food grains and animal fodder worth Rs 65,000 when the lockdown began. With no shows, and complete lockdown, the troupe is stuck within their tents and are cordoned off from the main road and the Wagholi village, hence we helped them with dog food 100kg, rice 350kg, gram 100kg,mugdal 50kg,2cans oil, onion 60kg, potato 55kg, animal feed 1,000kg, sugar 50kg, teapowder 5kg and maize 1,000kg.”Dilip Nath of The Great Bombay Circus, which is stuck in Tamil Nadu with 80 artistes and support staff, is surviving with the support of the local government. “90 per cent of the circus industry is hit by this pandemic and we see less chances of survival of the smaller circus units with no support for the future. Hence we appeal to the government to lend us a support to stand on our feet again,” said Nath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/with-no-shows-for-three-months-circus-troupes-in-dire-straits-in-pune/story-2Xy3dQN3ucz6mufGS7LgnL.html
18-05-2020||City||With no helping hand, coolies bear the brunt of pandemic on their own||When the travel restrictions were imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), among the first to lose their livelihood were the coolies at the railway station who once made travelling easier by helping people carry their luggage. Yet when the pandemic struck, they had no one to offer a helping hand.What went against them was that though they work for the railways, they are not exactly railway employees. “We get relaxation for travelling in trains but we do not receive salary from the railways. The central government says that we are not permanent employees so we should ask for help from state government and state government says that as we work for the railways, the central government should help us,” says Kashmiri Lal, national president of the All India Railway Lal Vardi Coolie Union. There are around 20,000 coolies across country, of which around 350 work at different stations of Punjab.Shalu, 35, one such coolie who works at the Ludhiana railway station says, that the last two months have been hard for him and his family. “I have been working as a coolie for the past 12 years. I have no other source of livelihood. Due to the pandemic-induced lockdown, I am out of work and have no money to buy anything,” he says.Initially, he took to purchasing ration on credit or depended on non-governmental organisations (NGOs). “But now, shopkeepers are also turning us away and NGOs have also stopped coming to help us. We are now solely dependent on the administration,” Shalu says.He says that the administration delivers ration after 10 days of applying through the helpline. “The administration provides us essentials but one cannot survive just on ration. There are many other necessary products that one has to purchase, especially when there are children at home,” Shalu says, adding that there were 56 coolies working at Ludhiana railway station and around 20 of them have returned to their villages in Rajasthan.With regular train services suspended till June 30, the coolies have little hope. “We have to survive another month without money,” says All India Railway Lal Vardi Coolie Union president Kashmiri Lal. “The railways must deploy us on the goods trains and pay us minimum wages at least,” he says. He adds that he has written several mails to the Prime Minister’s office, railway minister, chief minister, general manager railways, divisional railway manager and several other departments but all in vain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-no-helping-hand-coolies-bear-the-brunt-of-pandemic-on-their-own/story-Ic0PmLfBVI4E9Zx6BhoyaI.html
18-05-2020||City||Triple whammy for HP apple growers||The Rs4,000 crore apple economy is facing multiple challenges during the Covid-19 lockdown with untimely rain and hailstorms damaging trees, birds and animals damaging crops and non-availability of labour and fruit packaging material. Hail and rain in the last two weeks battered orchards in the major apple growing regions of Shimla, Kullu and Mandi district, damaging apples, cherries, pears, plums and almonds. Areas where the impact was severe included Rohru, Jubbal, Kotkhai, Rampur, Kullu and Nirmand, with calls growing louder from growers for loan waivers.“Hailstones were the size of walnuts and caused immense damage,” said Hari Singh Thakur, an apple grower in Nirmand.Animals, birds in orchardsRestricted human activity during the lockdown has also led to birds, especially pigeons or harials and bats, picking at fruits and damaging them. “With no one to guard my orchards, birds and other animals are feasting on the crops,” said Bhagat Singh Thakur, a fruit grower in Brasli village located near Rohru Bazar.Transportation and labour woesHarvesting, packaging and transportation of apple was mainly dependent upon migratory labour force from Nepal and some parts of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and other states, but travel restrictions and safety protocols by the government during the lockdown affected movement. More than one lakh Neplaese labourers, the backbone of the apple economy who came into Himachal Pradesh during the apple harvest season that commenced by mid-June in the lower heights and culminated in the higher regions by the end of October end, were unable to enter India. “We are extremely worried as these labourers will not come to the state. This will cause problems during the harvest and transportation of apple and we fear the fruits will rot in trees and orchards,” says Lokinder Singh Bisht, president of the Progressive Apple Growers. The growers had made several representations to the government and hoped steps would be taken soon to help them.Running out of packaging materialFruit growers were also concerned about unavailability of packaging material and increase in the prices of packing trays by around Rs 80 to Rs 150, as manufacturers claimed they had been hit by shortage of raw material.Urging chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and horticulture minister Mahender Singh Thakur to intervene and regulate the prices of trays and make arrangements for supply of raw material, Bisht said,“We also request the horticulture minister to chalk out a plan for procurement of all grades of apple with government agencies and private parties like Reliance Fresh, Adani Agri Fresh or Big Basket so that the state economy is saved from ruin.”Growers also demanded that the government facilitate hiring of private storage facilities in and outside the state to store produce and sell it later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/triple-whammy-for-hp-apple-growers/story-Qg64TAlW9StmMbSczj3nWI.html
18-05-2020||City||A 700-kilometre trek easier than seeing families starve, say migrants leaving Mohali||The migrants from the district, some with small children, are moving in hordes towards the railway stations and highways, not to catch a train or a bus, but to walk or cycle along the rails and roads hoping to reach home soon.Yes, they are aware of the special trains, but most of them do not have valid documents to apply for a ticket. Even for those with documents, digital illiteracy and long wait are deterrents that they are not ready to tackle; walking or cycling seems an easier bet.Two trains carrying 2,582 migrant workers left for Uttar Pradesh on Saturday from the Mohali railway station. The morning train left for Hardoi with 1,341 passengers and the evening train carried 1,241 migrants to Gorakhpur. More than 20 students were sent to Jammu on a bus from Kharar on Saturday.Alongside, a large number of migrants continued to walk or cycle their way home.Pratap Bhushan, a migrant who used to work with a packing factory in Zirakpur, said he purchased a new cycle with his savings and started for Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh on Saturday. “There is no work, and whatever little I had, is being saved to reach back home safe. I don’t have an Aadhaar card, so getting registered for a train ticket was out of question,” added Pratap, who along with a bag full of belongings is carrying a pump in case the tyres get deflated. He left Zirakpur in a group of five persons, all of whom were staying together on rent and had purchased new cycles.‘NO OTHER OPTION’“There is no other option,” said Nand Lal, who along with his family of five left Zirakpur on Friday. “We are struggling to get two square meals, so how can we pay rent? Back in the village at least children will not have to sleep on empty stomachs,” he said.“To get cooked food, we had to stand in a line for two hours. The food was not sufficient to feed all the members of the family,” Lal said, adding, he will rather walk more than 700 kilometres than see his family starve.“There is no work and the landlords are asking for rent,” said Rashpal, a construction labourer, who is walking to Gorakhpur along with his 10 friends.Another migrant, Bhushan Thakur, said “Walking on the track is easy and the police do not stop you. I will go back to farming the small landholding I have.”ONLINE REGISTRATION NO GUARANTEE OF RAIL TICKET “We came to Punjab 10 years ago in search of work, but now with no money, we want to go back,” said Radhey, a migrant who has been waiting for the last five days for tickets for his family to arrive, so they can board the train to Hardoi, just like the one that left Mohali railway station on Saturday.Getting registered online does not guarantee tickets considering the limited number of seats and long lists of migrants waiting to get in. Radhey said, “Last time we could not get the ticket, so we decided we are not moving from here (the station). We are sleeping under the open sky, but what other option do we have.” He has two minor sons.Shyam Lal and his family, with three children, have been outside the screening since Friday. “Despite having received a message, I was not allowed inside for screening. They say it is only for people staying in Dera Bassi or Zirakpur. Where do I go now,” asked Shyam Lal, who wants to go back to Bareilly. He was staying in Panchkula and reached Zirakpur after his relative informed him that a train was leaving from Mohali.RUSH AT SCREENING CENTRES“The migrants from colonies near Nada Sahib and slum areas near Sector 20 in Panchkula have been pouring into Mohali to board the trains. This is leading to a rush outside the screening centres,” said Kuldeep Bawa, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) of Dera Bassi.The migrant families have been allowed to sit outside the screening centres as many have handed over the keys of their rented accommodations back to the landlords, the SDM said. Some leave after a day or two while others continue to wait for the next screening, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrants-leaving-mohali-say-they-would-rather-walk-or-cycle-700-kilometers-than-see-their-families-starve/story-PczB0znG89PXY4iMLUDQrI.html
18-05-2020||Lucknow||Rescued circus elephants celebrate five years of freedom||Four rescued circus elephants were treated with a ‘jumbo cake’ to celebrate their five years of freedom. The elephants—Macadamia, Walnut, Coconut and Peanut have completed five years at Wildlife SOS’s Elephant Conservation & Care Centre in Mathura.Separated from their families as babies, isolated, neglected, and brutally trained to perform painful tricks, had been the life of these elephants until they were rescued by Wildlife SOS from circus in 2015. Young elephants are often known for their vivacious nature, but years of abuse had left them with long-lasting scars. Today, the ‘Nut Herd’—as they are lovingly called, has overcome their traumatic history and is living a safe and healthy life.11-year-old Peanut is the youngest and most mischievous one. She shares a close bond with 17-year-old Coconut, who often takes on the role of a protective sister. They are practically inseparable and often enjoy going on walks and swims in the river.27-year-old Macadamia and 23-year-old Walnut are healthy bull (male) elephants. They have their own enclosures with separate pools, which they often enjoy for dipping in. Their enclosures are equipped with structural and cognitive enrichments designed to keep them mentally and physically stimulated.To celebrate their rescue anniversary, the veterinarians and elephant care-takers at Wildlife SOS prepared special ‘cakes’, made of cooked pulses and vegetables.Dr Yaduraj Khadpekar, assistant director veterinary and research, Wildlife SOS, said, “Peanut and Coconut are very playful and, as is typical of adolescent elephants, possess a bit of a destructive streak. They enjoy playing vigorously. Whereas, Wally and Mac are currently in musth, thus making their behaviour slightly unpredictable, but treats are a great way of gaining their cooperation.”Kartick Satyanarayan, CEO & co-founder of Wildlife SOS, said, “The Nut Herd was the largest, and the youngest, group of elephants rescued by Wildlife SOS in a go. We had to revamp our whole centre to accommodate four young, boisterous elephants who would need more space and resources as they grew up. Over the past five years, they have matured into delightful pachyderms with continued care, and it has been a wonderful experience to be part of their journey.”Baiju Raj M.V, director conservation projects, Wildlife SOS, said, “It is a pleasure to see the difference that a few years of love can make in the lives of distressed elephants. Today is Endangered Species Day and I couldn’t think of a better way to honour it than by celebrating the rescue anniversary of these incredible elephants.”Their story is representative of nearly 2,500 elephants in India who suffer deprived lives and captivity, giving tourists’ a ride, and performing at weddings, temples and on streets. With a population of 23,000 to 27,000 Asian elephants, India remains the last stronghold of the species. Thus, the survival of the entire species is critically linked with its survival in India.In a conservation ‘win’ for the endangered Asian elephants, the species was recently added to appendix I of UN convention on migratory species at the conference hosted in Gandhinagar, India. This will merit heightened conservation and protection measures for the species.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/rescued-circus-elephants-celebrate-five-years-of-freedom/story-IgOFZS5ueuuUoCcJ6OrgPM.html
