21-05-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena calls BJP ‘two-faced’ for planning protest during crisis||Amidst the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, politics in Maharashtra has heated up with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chalking out an agitation against the state government led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.The state BJP’s `Maharashtra Bachao’ (Save Maharashtra) protest kick-started on Tuesday, with a party delegation meeting with Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to complain against the state’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, and demanding an independent fiscal package from the government for Covid-19.As a part of this agitation, the BJP has also planned a state-wide protest on Friday between 11am and 12pm, wherein party workers will unfurl black flags outside their homes and hold signs condemning the Maharashtra government. The party has asked workers across the state to shout slogans targeting Thackeray during the agitation and send footage of their protests to the media. The party has claimed lakhs of its workers will participate in this agitation.State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said, “The Covid-19 situation in the state is dire and this is a reflection of the Thackeray government’s utter failure in handling this pandemic. For two months, we refrained from doing anything but now as an opposition party, we have to do our duty to unmask the situation and express the citizenry’s discontent and anger.”Former chief minister and Leader of Opposition, Devendra Fadnavis said, “Maharashtra is the most affected state and it seems the situation in Mumbai has gone out of the hands of the government. The government made strategic errors since the beginning of the lockdown. The CM is new and has no administrative experience.”These protest plans have irked the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi, with Shiv Sena slamming the BJP for being “two-faced” given that Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his public addresses has been asking everyone to work together.Priyanka Chaturvedi, Sena’s spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member, tweeted: “It is a shame @BJP4Maharashtra is ignoring PM Modiji’s advise and continuing their political agenda. Instead of helping the government and the state to fight Covid, they protest.”The ruling parties are viewing the protest as part of a larger campaign to malign the government as it comes in the backdrop of a tweet by senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy earlier this week, in which he shared an article calling for President’s Rule in Maharashtra. Swamy had also tweeted that his opinion was that Thackeray must break the alliance with the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and join the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) again.“This is a sustained effort by the BJP to malign the MVA government. Someone or the other has been recommending President’s Rule or calling for the Army in Maharashtra under the guise of so-called bad management,” said a senior Sena minister, on condition of anonymity.NCP state chief and minister, Jayant Patil said, “Before imposing President’s Rule in Maharashtra, they must remove the governments in Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Gujarat. This is not the time to indulge in politics, otherwise, we could ask several questions starting with how did the coronavirus spread in the country with their government in charge. What was Modiji doing until mid-March even when it was evident that the coronavirus was going to be a global pandemic?”Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant released an earlier video clip of Fadnavis speaking to the media during the Sangli floods last year, slamming the then Opposition for indulging in politics at the time of a disaster. Sawant tweeted: “Doctors, medical care workers, police, administration, and the government are battling with Covid-19. BJP leaders instead of joining this battle are fighting with the government. This is a tragedy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-calls-bjp-two-faced-for-planning-protest-during-crisis/story-4Eum76ssr6ZuPLsWhXGpuK.html

Aviation operations are under the Central government, and the discussions to restart will happen with the state government. We will take a call on the same after getting directions from the state government. However, we will prefer to have those arriving in the city via domestic flights to be home quarantined for 14 days.”Meanwhile, BMC has issued a circular stating that all international passengers arriving in Mumbai, who are being quarantined at hotels, will be compulsorily tested before getting discharged. Starting May 10, more than 2,000 passengers have arrived in the city from countries like UK, US, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh, etc. “All passengers from international destinations will compulsorily be tested before completion of 14 days of quarantine. The charges payable for the test will be borne by the passenger. If the result is negative, the patient shall be released,” the circular states.“They shall quarantine themselves in a separate room and follow social distancing measures. The passengers released will have to be home quarantined with a stamp. If the passenger is tested positive, the test shall be repeated on the seventh day.

21-05-2020||City||Air pollution on the rise in Noida as factories open||Noida: After staying within prescribed limits during the first three phases of lockdown, the air pollution levels in Noida and adjoining regions have now started to rise.While the pollution levels are still much lesser – almost half – as compared to those of last year during the same period, the month of May is seeing a sudden spike in the air quality index that fluctuates between ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ categories on the air quality index (AQI) against the ‘satisfactory’ to ‘moderate’ categories last month.According to records from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), the AQI for Noida in April 2020 oscillated from 73 to 184 on a scale of 0 to 500, with half of the month seeing ‘satisfactory’ air quality. However, the AQI for May 2020 so far has oscillated between 97 and 160, with only a few days of ‘satisfactory’ air quality. On the AQI, 0 is least polluted whereas 500 is most polluted. Going by CPCB’s data, the month of April saw a total of 17 days of ‘satisfactory’, 12 days of ‘moderate’, and one day of ‘poor’ AQI. Meanwhile, until May 21, the month has experienced only three days of ‘satisfactory’ and 18 days of ‘moderate’ air quality.The AQI in April and May last year had oscillated between ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ categories.According to the CPCB, for the month of April 2020, the average particulate matter (PM) 2.5 was recorded at 45.86 micrograms per cubic metres (Ug/m3), while the same was 84.52 Ug/m3 in the same month last year. The average volume of PM2.5 for May 2020 so far has increased to 50 Ug/m3 against 99.38 Ug/m3 last year in May.The district administration of Gautam Budh Nagar had earlier in May allowed construction activities as well as restricted operations of industries to run. However, due to a number of reasons, the operations of industries are yet to reach their full potential.“While the pollution levels are still under control, thanks to the lockdown, pollution levels are rising yet again and the major reason seems to be that more and more vehicles are now plying on roads due to lockdown relaxations. We had also seen traffic across the Delhi-Noida-Direct flyway, even as industrial units and construction activities are still far from resuming operations to their full strength. This gives us a rough idea that we have to take a fresh look into the sources of pollution. The share of vehicular pollution has to be more than what it is believed to be,” said Ashish Jain, director, Indian Pollution Control Association.According to Noida-based environmentalists, increasing cases of waste burning is also causing issues and needs to be checked.“Slight rise in pollution levels could be felt and the AQI levels are also showing the same. While relaxation in the lockdown could be one of the reasons, however more and more incidents of waste burning, etc., are being reported. There are many cases of waste burning, and this has to be checked,” said Vikrant Tongad, a Noida-based environmentalist.While officials said they also noticed that the air quality is dropping, they, however, believe that meteorological reasons such as dust storms to be the major cause.“Yes, there has been slight deterioration in the air quality, but the major reason for the same is dust storms in recent weeks. Obviously, vehicular emissions are a reason and their share is somewhere between 22 to 33%, but the current situation is more due to the dust coming in,” said Anil Kumar Singh, regional officer, UPPCB, Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/air-pollution-on-the-rise-in-noida-as-factories-open/story-049uQ9WEEDuiJsugsyM93I.html

There were no casualties in the incident.As per fire department officials, the cause of the fire was a short circuit. According to fire department officials, the incident was reported around 11.30 am.“The fire started due to a short circuit in the corner of a godown of a food processing factory, after which it quickly spread to an adjacent packaging factory,” said chief fire officer (CFO), Arun Kumar Singh.Due to the volatile nature of the chemicals present in the industries, the fires spread quickly, said officials. A third factory, which housed moulding material, was also affected, although the damage there was far less compared to the other two factories.The godown mostly contained tetra packs of a mango juice variant, while there was packaging material in the second factory. The damage to the third unit was contained to just one corner.“It took almost two dozen fire tenders to control the fire. The majority of the fire was contained in an hour but it took almost four hours to completely douse it,” said the CFO.Officials said that factories had resumed operations recently and even though there was staff present who had to be rescued, there were no casualties. The incident could have been much worse had the fire spread to any other adjoining plots.The first factory was a single-story structure but the second one had two more floors above the ground. Both of them were completely gutted. An estimate of the loss is being prepared by the owners. No police complaints have been made in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fire-in-3-greater-noida-factories-no-injuries/story-qfjl54NdEd6rqcZQcq0fAK.html

At the start of the lockdown period, the Noida authority was serving two meals to over 13,0000 migrant workers, daily wagers, homeless people according to officials. With the Central government easing lockdown guidelines and allowing many businesses including factories, shops, retail outlets to resume operations, many workers have believed to join work or have either left for their home towns. Officials expect the number of people taking meals from distribution centers to decrease further in the coming days.“The Greater Noida authority served food to 20,000 people on May 19 and as many as 18,000 people on May 20 against the usual count of serving 47,000 people daily. The number is decreasing as either the workers are leaving the city or returning to their workplaces,” said Deep Chand, additional chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.Thousands of migrant workers have left for their home towns in trains and buses arranged by the district administration. The Uttar Pradesh government has directed the officials to continue arranging transportation until all migrant workers who want to go home reach their destinations. The state government took the decision to send arrange transport for the workers after many people had started walking to their homes undertaking long, arduous journeys. “Earlier when the requirement of food was at its peak, we served food to over 1,30,000 people every day. But now many migrants workers have left the city for their home towns. On Thursday, we served over 80,000 people in different sectors,” said a Noida authority spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-serving-food-to-only-18-000-migrant-workers-now-noida-feeding-80-000/story-TuVk8tTmN3CHGSg6rN7MfO.html
21-05-2020||Noida||Noida markets open to a tepid response on their first day||Many markets in Gautam Budh Nagar district wore a deserted look on Thursday, the first day of relaxation for commercial activities in the district.On Wednesday, the district administration had allowed shops to operate provided they followed the odd-even scheme (Each shop has a number given to them by their market association. Those with even numbers will open on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday while the rest will be open on all other days. On Sunday, all shops will be closed and will be sanitised) and social distancing protocol.Meanwhile, the police commissionerate had made elaborate arrangements for the safety and security of the traders, who opened their shops after nearly two months. GB Nagar commissioner of police (CP) Alok Singh said , “Flag marches with rapid action force (RAF) were conducted in different market areas of the district today. We also appealed to them to make sure their customers followed social distancing to check the spread of Covid-19. Our boys are also encouraging them to download the Aarogya Setu application on their mobiles,” he said.Manish Kumar, who runs a mobile shop in Atta Market, said that the first day passed in only cleaning the piles of the dirt accumulated during the lockdown period. “We have been asked to properly display the stipulated days of opening the shops. We have also been asked by the district administration to keep a detailed record of customer visiting the shops,” he said.Kumar said very few customers came to his shop on Thursday. “Earlier, it was never less than 200 customers a day. But today, it was only four customers till 4 pm,” he said.Echoing similar views, Dinesh Singh, who runs a restaurant in sector 63, said he received only two orders online. “With such a lukewarm response from the customers, it will be really hard to run this shop,” he said.Sushil Kumar Jain, the president of sector 18 market association, said that they did not expect many customers for at least two weeks. “I think the traders need at least a week’s time to clean their shops and the surrounding areas. After that, they will also have to generate faith among the customers that shopping with precautions will not cause any infection to them,” he said.GB Nagar traders suffered loss of over ₹200 crore during the lockdown, he said. “It’ll take at least a year to recover. The stocks left in our shops before the lockdown, are either outdated or have been destroyed by rats and cockroaches. Who’ll want to buy the clothes designed in February and March in May and June,” he said.Jain also criticised the government for not providing any relief to the small and medium traders. “We had to bear the salaries of our staff, rents, property taxes, electricity and water bills, besides the mounting bank dues, in the lockdown period. But, what is really foxing the trading community is that not even a single penny was allocated for us in the much-hyped ₹20 lakh crore package (announced by the central government). But, we have high hopes of revival,” he said. Meanwhile, according to the reports coming late, GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY, on Thursday evening, visited different markets in Noida, including Atta market in sector 18, Kanchanjanga Market in sector 50, Gijhor, Bhangel and Baraula. “The DM interacted with traders and customers at these places and asked them to strictly follow Covid-19 protocols. He also laid stress on ensuring complete sanitisation and safety measures,” the press release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-markets-open-to-a-tepid-response-on-their-first-day/story-efi5aXNGcMy63GbWDK4LfN.html
21-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad urban slips back into Red Zone, six more cases emerge||Based on the directions issued by the Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday night, urban areas of Ghaziabad district have been categorised as ‘red zones’. The government has also listed urban settlements in Gautam Budh Nagar, Meerut, Agra and Kanpur City as ‘red zones’.“The directions came late Wednesday night and the urban areas of Ghaziabad district are now in ‘red zone’ . As per earlier classification by the ministry of health and family Welfare, the district was categorised as ‘orange zone’. So now, the city areas have slipped into the red zone category where only a restricted number of activities are allowed,” Dr NK Gupta, district chief medical officer (CMO) said.The urban areas in Ghaziabad include localities such as Kaushambi, Vaishali, Indirapuram, Vasundhra, Sahibabad, Raj Nagar Extension, Crossings Republik, Raj Nagar, and Kavi Nagar among others.Under the new guidelines issued by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA)on May 17, states and union territories (UTs) were given powers to classify and demark red, green and orange zones while taking into consideration the parameters shared by the health ministry.The range of the zone can go up to a district, a municipal corporation or even smaller administrative units such as sub-divisions, etc, as decided by respective states and UTs.Within the red and orange zones, containment and buffer zones will be demarcated by the local authorities taking into account the guidelines of the health ministry.“Classifying Ghaziabad’s urban areas as ‘red zone’ was done keeping in mind the number of parameters like total active cases, active cases per lakh of population, rate of doubling of cases, fatality rate, testing ratio, and positive sample rate. After the city area was declared a red zone, we prepared a list of 50 areas under category 1 (having one positive case) and another set of 18 areas under category 2 (having more than one positive case). In these containment zones activities will be restricted,” the CMO added.According to the list, category 1 areas includes pockets in Raj Nagar Extension, Shaheed Nagar, Sahibabad, Jhandapur, Vaishali sector-1, Mohan Nagar, Vasundhara, Loni, Khoda, Sanjay Nagar, and Vijay Nagar among others.The category 2 containment zones include areas in Khoda, Indirapuram, Dasna Gate, sectors 1 and 5 in Vaishali, Jhandapur and Islam Nagar among others.Only activities related to essential services are allowed in containment zones. Movement of people in and out of the sealed area is not allowed except for medical emergencies and for getting essential goods.“We have deployed teams in containment zones which are conducting surveillance activities like door-to-door surveys, collecting samples and sanitisation drives, etc,” Dr Gupta added.Till Thursday night, the tally of the Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad stood at 202 out of which 175 people have recovered so far, officials said.What affected city’s prospects?The officials said that the number of active cases and the doubling rate put the city moved the city from ‘orange zone’ to ‘red zone’. The city has 37 active cases currently, said officials.The categorisation was broadly based on six parameters—total active cases (zero or no cases reported in last 21 days is the most desirable scenario), active cases per lakh of population, case doubling rate (more than 28 days desired), case fatality rate (less than 1% of the total population is the desired rate), testing ratio, sample positivity rate ).“The city lost primarily on two counts— total active cases which are still 37 (till Thursday night), and the doubling rate. The number of cases have doubled at a faster pace. The rest of the parameters are very much in control, but positive cases are being reported at a fast rate each day even though many patients are getting discharged,” Dr Gupta said.“The cases are coming in each day and there are barely any days with zero cases now. For the city to move out of the ‘red zone’ category, we need zero cases to be reported for 21 days continuously. However, the incidence of positive cases being reported in Ghaziabad is coming down,” Dr DK Sonkar, state observer sent by the Uttar Pradesh government to Ghaziabad.The first case of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Ghaziabad was reported on March 5 and in a span of about 48 days. the figure reached 50 cases on April 22. On May 5, Ghaziabad had 100 cases.The next 50 cases (total count 150) were reported in a span of another 10 days, while the district crossed the 200-mark on May 21. Six new cases were reported on Thursday, taking the district’s tally to 202 cases.The district administration was supposed to roll out the plan for the opening of market areas on Thursday, but in light of the district being classified as a red zone, officials said, they will now release the guidelines on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-urban-slips-back-into-red-zone-six-more-cases-emerge/story-vqy7qTTKokynJhtl0Qg5vK.html
21-05-2020||City||Only 60 of 75,000 migrants sent home from Ghaziabad tested, results yet to come||Ghaziabad: Even as thousands of migrant workers are sent home from Ghaziabad to their hometowns by buses and trains every day, the health department has tested only 60 workers for the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease since Monday, with another 30 samples on Thursday.According to an estimate by district authorities, around 75,000 migrant workers have been sent to their home towns from Ghaziabad by state-run Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) buses, as well as trains which are plying from Ghaziabad railway station to cities in UP and Bihar. This figure, however, does not include those migrant workers who have left from the district or have gone through on foot or in trucks.The state health department officials said Thursday evening that out of a total of 46,142 migrant workers tested so far, at least 1,230 have tested positive for Covid-19. There have been concerns that the reverse migration could take the virus to their home districts and towns which have hitherto not seen coronavirus cases.“The directions for taking up sampling of migrant workers were received only three days ago and we were asked to collect 20 samples each day for pool testing. So far, we have collected only 60 samples in three days (till Wednesday) and reports of these are yet to be received. We sent the samples initially to Noida for testing but they denied (undertaking testing). Now, these samples have been sent to Meerut and test reports are awaited,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.“The migrant workers should be checked comprehensively but we started taking sampling only when directions came from state officials three days ago. We have noted details of workers whose samples were taken. If they come out positive, we will inform their home district,” he added.He added that the health department teams deployed at shelter homes were asked to collect 30 samples on Thursday.“Covid-19 testing is not possible for every migrant worker but health teams are carrying out body temperature checks with the help of infrared temperature monitors. We have about 1,000-1,200 staff members including bus drivers and conductors deployed in ferrying passengers but their tests have not been done so far,” said AK Singh, regional manager of UPSRTC.Raghvendra Singh, who works as a driver and is from Banda district in Bundelkhand region of UP, raised concerns that there are no ways to check whether any of the other migrants travelling with him have the coronavirus.“I came here Thursday morning with my wife from Ramprastha where I work as a driver. There are about 40 persons in the bus apart from 15-20 children with their parents. So there is hardly any social distancing. Officials at the (Ramlila) ground merely checked our temperature and told us to board the bus. This will not help in case someone is infected. On my part, I spent Rs 500 to buy a hand sanitizer and a face mask for me and my wife,” he said.Shiv Nath, from Gorakhpur, reached Morta in Ghaziabad from Sonipat in Haryana on Wednesday night on foot. He is travelling by bus to his home town with five other family members.“There are thousands of migrants in the farm house (where the migrants have been housed) and all are sleeping in close spaces on the floor. Before boarding the bus, our temperature was checked. At present, we don’t if anyone is infected or not but our priority is to reach home. Once I am home, I will get myself tested,” he added.Amit Mohan Praasad, UP’s principal secretary (health), said Thursday many migrant workers who have returned to their home towns or villages have tested positive. “Migrants are being monitored for Covid-19. Our Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) members have contacted at least 5,42,543 migrant workers at their homes. Out of a total of 46,142 samples collected so far, 1,230 have tested positive. Monitoring is also taken up by Mohalla Nigrani Samiti and Gram Nigrani Samiti as the migrants have been asked to remain in home quarantine for 21 days,” Prasad said.According to officials, over 20 lakh migrant workers have returned home across UP so far with the help of buses and trains. The figure includes about 15.27 lakh workers who have come home or are in the process of reaching home with the help of 1,154 trains being run by the Indian Railways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/only-60-of-75-000-migrants-sent-home-from-ghaziabad-tested-results-yet-to-come/story-syihUxXnXqy308Fnm2ZC9J.html
21-05-2020||Noida||PG residents allege harassment by landlord over rent||Residents of a paying guest accommodation in Sector 66 have alleged that they are being harassed by the landlord for rent even though the facilities he promised have stopped working.The residents took to social media to express their displeasure at the situation.“We request the UP government to protect us. We are nearly 100 people living in sector 66. We are being mentally disturbed again and again for the rent and we are being asked for extra money even though the kitchen has been closed for a month (sic),” read one such tweet.Residents have also uploaded photos of the empty kitchen. A majority of the group is from Kerala. They have alleged that they have been stuck there without any help or food.“Last month they asked us for extra money saying that the price of commodities has gone up. Most of us paid the increased amount but the kitchen has been non-functional ever since. Then this month the owner kept harassing us for rent even though we are not receiving any of the promised facilities,” Shubham Singh, a resident of the PG, said.He said that the owner even told them that the new rent cycle would begin from the 20th of every month.“There were almost 100 of us here, but now we are down to around 50. More of us are leaving the place. I will also shift soon as we are not even getting food here. The owner doesn’t live here and even the caretaker left weeks ago,” Singh said.Residents said that they hope officials take cognizance of the matter even though a call to the police earlier had not yielded any help.“We have reports of a caretaker from the area who had fled. We will check if this is the same establishment. So far, no complaints have come to us but we will look into the matter,” Anil Kumar Singh, station house officer, Phase 3 police station, said.Several attempts to reach the owner of the PG accommodation failed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/pg-residents-allege-harassment-by-landlord-over-rent/story-g2vLLV64JsrD3DHDoYJdRP.html
21-05-2020||City||Couple assaulted by landlord over rent||A family living in a rented accommodation in Sector Alpha 2 in Greater Noida was allegedly assaulted by the landlord on Tuesday night, following an argument over their inability to pay the rent.The family is a native of Agra and has been living in the house for the past three months. The husband works for a security service company but has not received his salary for the past couple of months.“In March, a friend was visiting us, but the landlord had problems with him staying here. Soon, the lockdown happened. But somehow, I managed to take him back to Lucknow. On my way back, there was an accident in which my car was damaged. A lot of our savings went in its repair and we are still waiting for the insurance payment,” said the husband on account of anonymity.He said that the family was having trouble in paying the rent of ₹6,500. “The landlord was well aware of our financial problems, but on Tuesday night, he came downstairs and demanded that we pay him instantly. There was an argument, which was soon settled. But after a while, he came back again with other people and his family members and started manhandling us and threatening to throw our stuff out,” said the man.In the ensuing scuffle, the wife sustained a mild injury. Their four-year-old son was also present at the house, during the time of the incident.“They started to throw our stuff outside and asked us to leave immediately. It was only after the intervention of neighbours, they we were able to escape. When we said that we will call the police, they boasted of having connections. Later, however, we did call the police, who took me for first aid and helped us get back when the landlord refused to even open the gate. We are now looking for another place,” said the wife.Based on her complaint, a case was registered against the landlord, his two children and other unidentified people under sections 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 452 (house trespass) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).“The landlord was arrested, while the roles of the other people are being investigated,” said Sujeet Kumar Upadhyay, station house officer (SHO), Beta 2 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/couple-assaulted-by-landlord-over-rent/story-tdiy8xS0ApSvZU5S8ZsHVM.html

21-05-2020||City||Education department directs private schools to pay teachers for May and June||Bringing much relief to teachers, the district education department has categorically asked private schools in Gautam Budh Nagar to pay full salaries to their teaching staff for the months of May and June. Many teachers had feared amid the ongoing lockdown announced to halt the spread of the coronavirus disease they will not be paid salaries for two months by the schools.District inspector of schools (DIOS), Gautam Budh Nagar, Neeraj Pandey, said the schools have been allowed to collect tuition fees for the first quarter of the present fiscal, i.e. April to June. “But instead of collecting the fees for three months quarterly, the schools have been asked to collect fees on a monthly basis,” he said.He further said as per state government’s directives, the schools can’t hike the fees for the current academic year 2020-21. “They have been directed not to collect transportation charges and other miscellaneous fees for the lockdown period. Since the schools have been allowed to take tuition fees, there is no reason for them to stop the salaries of their teachers,” he said.A teacher from Delhi Public in Sector 30, who requested anonymity, said the school management has already decided to cut the salaries of the teaching staff for May and June. “Earlier, the school management had decided to make a 100% deduction in our salaries, but after the directives from the state government the school might reduce the salaries by 50 to 60%.”Social activist and member of the Centre of Indian Trade Union (CITU) Gangeshwar Dutt Sharma said it will a gross injustice to the teachers if they won’t be paid by the schools even when they have been allowed to collect fees from the students. “We have suggested the state government to treat the April-June quarter of the academic session as a zero period and the new academic session for 2020-21 should start from July 1. We suggest that no feed should be collected for this zero period. We have also suggested the government that schools should also be allowed for non-payment of the salaries to the teachers and staff for this period. Instead, the school management should give them three months’ advance and deduct the amount in 12 installments from their regular monthly salaries,” he said.Sharma also said that some private schools in Greater Noida had announced that they will not take fees for the lockdown period. “It is a welcome step. Other reputed private schools too should not collect fees for the lockdown period,” he said.Meanwhile, Kamini Bhasin, principal, Delhi Public School in Sector 30, said the school administration is yet to make a decision on reducing the salaries of their teachers and other employees. “The staff are getting their salaries on time. As far as collecting fees from students is concerned, we are following all the guidelines issued by the government,” she said.Savita Mehta, vice-president of corporate communication wing, Amity International School, said the school management has always been supportive of its employees. “We are paying salaries regularly to our staff, and they will continue to get their salaries regularly in the future as well,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/education-department-directs-private-schools-to-pay-teachers-for-may-and-june/story-weDNBuvqdeF0WqJbl6qxCM.html

21-05-2020||Delhi||In the past week, Delhi got nine new containment zones, nine were de-sealed||In the last one week, Delhi witnessed sealing of nine areas as Covid-19 containment zones even as nine other sealed zones witnessed scaling down of containment efforts, government data showed.Between May 14 and Thursday, the Capital saw an increase in the number of fresh cases from 7,998 to 11,088, but the numbers pertaining to active Covid-19 cases witnessed a marginal increase from 5,034 to 5,720, suggesting a decent rate of people recovering from the disease, say experts.Active Covid-19 cases are calculated after deducting the total number of people who have recovered, discharged from hospital and deaths from the cumulative figure of fresh cases recorded.For this one week period, Delhi recorded a recovery rate of around 76 people per 100 fresh cases against the all-India average of 55 people per 100 fresh cases, data extracted from Delhi government dashboard and records of Union ministry of health showed. During the period, the death toll increased from 106 to 176, the government records showed.According to Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, it is a good strategy on part of the Delhi government to scale down restrictions in parts of the city where the caseload is low but also, simultaneously, sealing areas that are assessed as potential Covid-clusters.“It is clear that Covid is there to stay and the lockdown cannot be imposed indefinitely. So, regular assessment of the containment zones and other high caseload areas which can potentially qualify to be sealed as containment zones is a good strategy. Also, the data pertaining to the period (May 14-21) show good results in terms of recovery of people from the disease,” said Kishore.In the last one week the Delhi government “de-contained” sealed areas in Block 34 of Trilokpuri, Israel Camp in Rangpuri, K2 block in Nihal Vihar, Oberoi Apartment in central Delhi, G1 block in Mansarovar Garden, Lane 14 in Kalyanpuri, three lanes in D-block of Sangam Vihar, Deenpur Village and Shahjahanabad Society in Dwarka.“For scaling down containment efforts, it is mandatory that no case is recorded in a containment zone for at least 28 days. Even if one case comes up on the 27th day, the counting begins afresh,” said Rahul Singh, district magistrate (south-west).Between May 14 and 21, containment zones were added in F block of Dakshinpuri, the main road of Zamroodpur, three separate pockets in Jahangirpuri, Dhobiwali Gully in Azadpur, Chandrashekhar Azad Colony in Wazirpur Industrial Area, BB block in Shalimar Bagh and C block of Sultanpuri.“Containment zones were added only when cluster cases were recorded in certain pockets,” said B M Mishra, district magistrate (south)On Tuesday, Delhi’s health secretary Padmini Singla, sent letters to all district magistrates in which she red-flagged the fact that the number of containment zones were going down even as Covid-19 cases in the city rose exponentially.An order issued by Singla on Tuesday, which HT has seen, directed the district magistrates to reconsider fresh assessment of Covid-19 cases in their revenue districts and create containment zones “as per guidelines” of the Union health ministry if needed.Containment zones are sealed areas where residents are not allowed to venture out, they are subjected to regular screening and community testing for symptomatic people, high contact tracing, regular sanitisation, door-to-door health checks and doorstep delivery of essential goods, even as the rest of the city witnesses phased revival of business and commerce activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/in-the-past-week-delhi-got-nine-new-containment-zones-nine-were-de-sealed/story-sAVV9kutzGZAFfBq0EASAN.html

On the same date, the administration had also imposed an additional excise duty of 12% on alcohol. On account of additional duties and cess imposed this year, liquor prices in the city are now higher by 20% to 25% .UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said the Covid cess will bring the administration an additional revenue of ₹18–₹20 crore.

21-05-2020||City||Targeted reduction in paddy area in Punjab to save groundwater||The proposed reduction in the area to be covered under traditional water-guzzling paddy in Punjab this year due to labour shortage is likely to give some respite to already depleting groundwater table in the state.As per the target set by the state agriculture department, the department is expecting to reduce the area under paddy cultivation by at least 3 lakh hectares -- from 29.3 lakh hectares last year to 26.3 lakh hectares this year.Of the total area under paddy cultivation, 4 lakh hectare (20% more than last year) is expected to be sown with lesser water consuming direct seeding of rice (DSR) technique this year, while 7 lakh hectare is likely to be covered under basmati varieties with the onset of monsoon. Last year, 6.5 hectare area was under basmati.According to the 2019 report of the Central Ground Water Board, Punjab tops the country in over-exploitation of groundwater at 79%.Bathinda, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Moga, Pathankot and Patiala are the worst-affected districts in the state.Agriculture secretary Kahan Singh Pannu said the exploitation of groundwater is a serious issue, but they are planning to save lakhs of litres of sub-soil water this year. “We are hopeful water will be saved with cooperation of farmer fraternity in achieving the set targets related to increasing area under direct seeding of rice and reducing area under paddy sown through traditional water-guzzling techniques,” Pannu said.As per the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, 2,500 to 5,500 litres of water is needed to produce a kg of rice. For one hectare of paddy field, 50-60 lakh litre water is required depending on the soil quality.However, Pannu added that the advancement of paddy sowing by 10 days this year will put extra burden on groundwater table as over 14 lakh tubewells will pump out groundwater for irrigation purposes.“But it can be compensated with planned sowing and better techniques,” he added.Due to labour shortage amid Covid-19 crisis, the state government has advanced paddy sowing season by 10 days — from June 20 to June 10.Director, agriculture, Sutantar Kumar Airi said the department is making all-out efforts to convince farmers to minimise the area under water-guzzling varieties.“At least 4 lakh hectare area is expected to be sown with DSR technique, which requires less irrigation as compared to normal transplantation. There is no need of puddling and heavy irrigation at the time of sowing under DSR,” Airi said. He added that 3 lakh hectare area will be shifted this year from paddy cultivation to cotton and maize crops, which require minimal irrigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/targeted-reduction-in-paddy-area-in-punjab-to-save-groundwater/story-G7Exzt9tbEw0ZpG3UV1JHM.html
21-05-2020||Chandigarh||Consumer forum: Chandigarh realty firm penalised for failing to hand over plot||For failing to give possession of a plot to its owner, BCL Homes Limited, Dariya, Chandigarh, and three directors were directed by the district consumer disputes redressal forum to refund ₹7.55 lakh and pay total ₹50,000 in compensation to three city residents. Om Parkash Mittal and his wife Santosh Kumari from Sector 49-A and Satinder Garg from Sector 32-D had filed a case against the company and its directors, saying they had booked two plots of 200 sq yards each and paid the company a registration fee of ₹2.60 lakh each in May 2011.According to their complaint, at the time of payment, BCL Homes issued them letters stating that if later, they did not wish to take the plot due to any reason, they would be refunded ₹14,500 per sq yard. Also if they wished to cancel registration any time before the project launch, they would be refunded the registration amount with an additional interest of 24% per annum. However, the company never launched the project and never got in touch after receiving the amount.In October 2014, the company not only refused to allot the booked plot, but allotted a 1-BR flat in Chinar Homes, Zirakpur. The amount already paid by the three customers was adjusted against the payment of an installment of a re-allotted flat, and furthermore, the company demanded two more installments. So the three complainants paid a total of ₹7.55 lakh. Thereupon, the three moved the district consumer court stating that their hard earned money was grabbed on false promises and misrepresentations.In their reply, the company and its two directors responded, saying, “The possession of the fully developed project could not be offered on account of unforeseeable circumstances beyond their control that prevented them from fulfilling a contract.”The company also said that the complainants never approached them, as claimed in the complaint, adding that as per terms and conditions of the re-allotment, no claim of refund of the amount was to be made by the complainant.The forum observed: “We see no reason why the interest earned by opposite parties on the amount of ₹7,55,000 not be passed over to complainants. Why should it become additional profit for the opposite parties?”It directed the company and its three directors to refund ₹7.55 lakh along with interest at 9% per annum from the respective dates of deposit, till its realisation. They were also told to pay ₹50,000 in compensation for “deficiency in service” and for causing mental and physical harassment”, as well as ₹10,000 in litigation costs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/consumer-forum-chandigarh-realty-firm-penalised-for-failing-to-hand-over-plot/story-0SobFg8NPCzuks5ya0YJKK.html
21-05-2020||Chandigarh||Education dept seeks fee details from private schools in Chandigarh||Following reports of city schools charging consolidated fee instead of tuition fee in violation of Chandigarh education department’s orders on collection of fee during the lockdown, the district education officer (DEO), Alka Mehta, has sought details from schools on fees and fund.The DEO, in a letter to the principals of all 77 unaided recognised schools of Chandigarh, has asked them to give details of annual charges along with monthly charges including tuition fee and transportation charges via email within a day.The DEO has further asked the schools to certify that they were charging only tuition fee in compliance of the department’s orders, and collecting no other charges.This comes a day after media reports that just a day after city schools were allowed to collect the tuition fees monthly, most of them had already violated the order by asking for additional fees like annual fee, hobby fee, and caution fee, calling it consolidated fee instead of tuition fee.A parent had also filed a complaint against a Sector 44-based school with the fee regulation body of Chandigarh alleging that the school was charging exorbitant fee while indulging in profiteering and commercialisation of education. The parent had also alleged that the school had increased fees by over 10% in this academic session.“The term tuition fee is vague. It is surprising that the schools have been given the liberty to declare how much proportion of the consolidated fee is tuition fee, while they are claiming that the full amount is tuition fee alone,” said Nitin Goyal, president, Chandigarh Parents’ Association.The schools have also moved the Punjab and Haryana high court challenging UT’s order, claiming that the administration had no jurisdiction to pass such an order and that under the law, there is a provision of a fee regulatory authority. The hearing is scheduled for Friday.President of Independent Schools’ Association HS Mamik said, “The details sought by the DEO are beyond her jurisdiction. The case is subjudice in the high court.” PUBLIC DEALING FOR DSE OFFICE Meanwhile, the education department has initiated the process of online confirmation for the public for an appointment with the director school education (DSE) and director higher education. The appointment has to be sought minimum two days in advance. The visitors can book an appointment by filling up the form on the department website www.chdeducation.gov.in. The visitors are expected to reach the office as per the time allocated to them so that social distancing is maintained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/education-dept-seeks-fee-details-from-private-schools-in-chandigarh/story-2bwtfFnIBg44ASKuf42FnO.html
21-05-2020||Chandigarh||Amid lockdown, chicken, mutton get pricier by up to 40% in Chandigarh||In just two months, chicken is pricier by ₹100 and mutton by ₹200 in the city, even after prices had taken a fall due to rumours about Covid-19 spreading through poultry. Now, prices are going up due to shortage of supply and rise in demand, and are likely to rise even more.The retail price of broiler chicken, which is usually ₹200 per kg, fell to ₹130 per kg in March. While last week, retailers asked for ₹180-190 per kg, now prices have now shot up to ₹230 to ₹260 per kg. Manager of King Broilers in Sector 46, Ravinder Kumar, said prices were rising owing to shortage of live poultry. Paramjeet SIngh Chawla, proprietor of Chawla’s Chicken, said “Sale of chicken has dropped by 75% even as prices are rising. Chicken will cost even more once administration allows restaurants to open doors for dine-in.”Mutton, which available for around ₹500 per kg in March, now costs up to ₹700 per kg. Speaking of this, Ashok Kumar Nagpal, a mutton wholesaler in Sector-21 meat market, said, “People have fewer qualms eating mutton rather than chicken, due to earlier rumours associating chicken with Covid-19 and bird flu. Now, with rise in demand for mutton, wholesalers and retailers are grabbing the opportunity to make an extra buck by hiking mutton prices.” However, prices of eggs remain stable at ₹4 to ₹5 per egg, he said.As per wholesalers, the supply of chicken was down due to the hot weather and shortage of chicken feed. Deepak, a wholesale supplier of chicken from Jagatpura village in Mohali district, said, “Chicken often suffer heat strokes during summer so the supply does go down a little every summer. But this time, supply is scantier due to lockdown curbs.”Most chicken in Chandigarh is supplied from Barwala village, Haryana. Harish Mittal, CEO of SS Poultry Farm in Barwala, said several poultry farmers with small businesses had to abandon their birds leading to a shortage. “Poultry farms have been hit by the exodus of migrants enmasse and are currently short-staffed. The price of feed increased due to shortage, while income from poultry dropped amid the lockdown. This impelled farmer farmers to abandon their birds on the roads, while some even dug holes and buried them rather than watch them suffer intense hunger,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-lockdown-chicken-mutton-get-pricier-by-up-to-40-in-chandigarh/story-EsHA4n1turvVq0mIhkSC9O.html
21-05-2020||Delhi||L-G asks govt and other stakeholders to undertake relief measures||Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal on Thursday wrote to the Delhi government, Delhi Police, all municipal corporations and Delhi Development Authority (DDA), urging them to take relief measures so as to minimise visits to government offices. These measures include automatic renewal of various licences, a moratorium on payments and other processes that can be simplified online through innovative use of technology.In his letter to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the L-G has suggested constituting a committee to suggest measures to help people and businesses with special focus on the protection of interests of labours.“The L-G directed the home department to take steps to explore the possibility of automatic extension of term or renewal of licences of various categories such as hotels, restaurants, guest houses, swimming pools, etc. which stand expired after 01.03.2020, taking into account safety concerns. Opening of all such establishments will be strictly governed by the guidelines issued by the Government of India,” read a statement released by the L-G office.He further advised local bodies that ongoing pending processes related to property tax, conversion charges for allowing commercial activities on mixed-use land, parking, mutation, etc., should be expeditiously completed. Baijal asked the municipal bodies to undertake day-to-day activities relating to sanitation, de-silting of drains and containment of vector-borne diseases, besides other regular works.The L-G advised the DDA to explore measures for a moratorium on payments so that EMD is not forfeited and allotment is not cancelled in this time of distress. “He further advised VC, DDA that ongoing pending processes e.g. execution of lease, conveyance deed, issuance of NOCs, layout/ completion plans; etc., should be expeditiously completed. To instil confidence in public, all ongoing and pending public projects of DDA may be given impetus and maximum public services should be made available ‘on line’,” the statement read.“Dwarka, Narela & Rohini sub-cities can be revamped with focus on attracting investment in commercial / IT / ITES / educational sectors through meticulous planning with special focus on vacant land pieces as low hanging fruits. Hon’ble LG has urged DDA to galvanize implementation of PM-UDAY, In-situ slum redevelopment, Land Pooling Policy and Transit Oriented Development,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/l-g-asks-govt-and-other-stakeholders-to-undertake-relief-measures/story-Y8Guk5jAijB5dtjJ9ZBfSN.html
21-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC directs financial aid for all registered construction workers||The Delhi High Court has directed the state government to send out proper communication, in the form of SMSs, to over five lakh construction workers, majority of who are yet to avail the financial aid of Rs 5,000 being given to them by authorities in view of the ongoing lockdown. The court also said that those workers whose registration has lapsed will also be entitled to the ex-gratia, but after they renew their membership.A bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar said that it was essential that all registered construction workers — whose number stood at 5,39,421 as on September 30, 2018 — be sent SMSs, informing them of the government’s decision of direct transfers to their registered bank accounts, so that they could renew their registration.The bench also said that the workers should be informed about the renewal fee that needs to deposited.“The fact that the website of the Delhi Building & Other Construction Workers Welfare Board (DBCWB) is in English is certainly a matter of concern, considering the strata of the society from which the construction workforce comes from,” the court said. The court’s direction comes after advocate Shyel Trehan, who had filed an application saying the benefit of ex gratia payments should be extended to those registrants whose registration may have lapsed, and who renew their registrations.Appearing for the Delhi government, its additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose, told the court that as on May 12, all the registered 39,600 construction workers had received an amount of Rs 5,000. He also stated that for the purpose of verification, communications have been sent to about 7,000 employers of these construction workers, out of whom only 242 have responded.In April, the Delhi government had given Rs 5000 to 39,600 registered construction workers. On May 11, the Delhi government had announced it was going to disburse Rs 5,000 more to all the registered construction workers in the city. However, a decision regarding disbursement of the sum for next month (June) also is yet to be taken.Wednesday’s court order comes while hearing a plea by social worker Sunil Kumar Aledia, filed through advocate Shiven Verma, seeking directions to the government to provide relief to workers and labourers, including those who had registered in the last two years. Contacted, the office of labour minister Gopal Rai said the government from May 15 had already initiated the process of re-registering construction workers in Delhi through an online process.“We started this online application process because we realised that membership of majority of workers registered with DBCWB had lapsed for lack of renewal, which costs Rs 20 per year. This registration process will go on until May 25.. More than 500 people are applying daily, at present,” said an official in the minister’s office.The registration process requires an applicant to upload copies of all required documents. After May 25, the labour department will begin the verification process of the applications. Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate Sudhir Nandrajog, told the court that as on September 30, 2018, there were 5,39,421 registered construction workers. He submitted that most of them did not renew their registration and, consequently, they have been denied the ex gratia payment.Following this, the court observed that “only a fraction of the originally registered construction workers have been able to avail of the ex gratia relief granted by the respondents (Delhi government), due to them not having renewed their registration”. “This is not a satisfactory state of affairs, and the respondents (Delhi government) are obliged to take effective steps to encourage the construction workers – who are otherwise eligible, to renew their registration — so that the intended benefit can reach them as well,” the court said.The matter would be now heard on June 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-directs-financial-aid-for-all-registered-construction-workers/story-0eswOfoNa8uU1FsA35dCNJ.html

We did not have any money, so we left. My employers gave some money and ration before asking me not to come,” says Ankita, who hails from Hardoi in Uttar Pradesh. “Chulha to bana liya par pakane ke liye kuch nahi hai, thoda dal chawal mil jata to kuch din gujara ho jata (I have made an earthen stove, but there is nothing to cook. If only we had some lentils and rice, it would have sufficed for a few days),” says Ankita, whose husband, Rohit, a labourer, has also been jobless since March 20.Similar is the plight of Kamla Rani, a native of Moradabad in UP, who has been working as a domestic help in Sector 4, Panchkula, for the past two decades. “Before the lockdown, I worked in around seven houses, but now, only two houses have called me back to work,” says Kamla, who has been putting up in Maheshpur village in Sector 21 with her husband, Suresh, who has also been sitting idle as the golf range in Sector 3, where he worked, has been shut.Even though domestic helps are ready to work, they are denied entry by most housing societies in the tricity owing to fear of contracting coronavirus infection. Sarojni, a domestic help who hails from Bihar and stays in Baltana, Mohali, has taken to selling vegetables. “Had there been jobs in Bihar, why would we have to leave our home? If we go back, we will starve there too,” she says. AUTHORITIES LEAVE IT TO PEOPLEEven though there are no restrictions on the working of maids, the authorities are leaving the matter to “individual decision”. “They (domestic helps) can work just like any self-employed person, such as plumbers and electricians,” says Girish Dayalan, deputy commissioner, Mohali.However, Panchkula sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Dheeraj Chahal says, “The working of maids is to be discouraged, but is not completely banned either. It is for the RWAs and individuals to take the call, keeping health protocols in mind.”Meanwhile, Chandigarh councillor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu says: “Most people in my area have allowed domestic helps to work, but some senior citizens have raised concern.”RESIDENT BODIES DIVIDEDWhile Rupinder Singh Kang, a resident of Aerocity, Mohali, says a few people in his locality have allowed the maids to come to work after following all precautions, SK Wadhawan, a member of confederation of residents’ welfare associations (RWAs), Zirakpur, says they have decided not to allow domestic helps in till the lockdown is lifted.Surinder Sharma, a member of Chandigarh’s Sector 15 RWA, adds that only 50% of the houses in the sector have allowed maids to work daily. However, RP Malhotra, president, federation of residents’ associations, Panchkula, says there should be a ban on entry of domestic helps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-leaves-domestic-helps-in-chandigarh-tricity-high-and-dry/story-nBGHiKhhPGhdKnnxZJChEK.html

This would also give an impetus to economic development of the area, she said.The minister said the present expressway project provided for upgrading the existing NH-3 from Kartarpur to Amritsar and establishment of new expressway connectivity to the Rajasansi airport even as the expressway took a separate route from Kartarpur to pass through Qadian and Gurdaspur before entering Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/harsimrat-urges-centre-to-alter-alignment-of-delhi-katra-expressway-to-link-amritsar/story-WDOs8Izsi4AAbTwdOa0WCJ.html
21-05-2020||Mumbai||State includes 2,092 villages in Western Ghats eco-sensitive area||The Maharashtra government on Thursday included more villages in its proposed final Western Ghats eco-sensitive area (ESA) notification, but has excluded previously identified villages falling in crucial wildlife corridors, sanctuary buffer areas and near tiger reserves.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray submitted the proposal for Maharashtra during a video-conference with Union minister for environment, forest and climate change Prakash Jawadekar on Thursday. “After the ESA for the Western Ghats is announced, curbs will be imposed on certain activities like hydropower projects, certain industries, mining, thermal power plants and large-scale constructions will be prohibited,” the CM’s Office tweeted.On October 3, the Centre had proposed the draft ESA across 56,825 sq km spanning across six states, covering 37% of the Western Ghats. Of this, 17,340 sq km was marked in Maharashtra, covering 2,133 villages.The state’s final proposal requests the Centre to include 2,092 of 2,133 villages or 15,359 sq km of the originally proposed 17,340 sq km, thereby excluding 11.4% of the draft ESA area, said state forest minister Sanjay Rathod.“From 2,133 villages, we requested the exclusion of 388 that fall in areas with high industrial and mining potential. However, we also requested the Centre to add 347 more villages that are falling within and around wildlife sanctuaries or protected zones that need to be safeguarded, and were left out in the draft,” said Rathod.“We requested the Centre to support all 2,092 villages with additional funds since development will be restricted after ESA declaration,” he added.The minister said the Centre’s final nod was still awaited.Thackeray said, “Our priority is the environment while achieving development. We want consistency to be maintained in the eco-sensitive zones in the area.”The list of 388 villages, excluded from the original draft, was accessed by HT. The entire Dodamarg taluka was not considered for ESA declaration, nine out of 13 originally ESA villages in Sawantwadi and Banda talukas were excluded for mining potential. Dodamarg-Sawantwadi belt forms a crucial elephant and tiger corridor in south Konkan. “This is in violation of a Bombay high court’s (HC) order to declare the entire corridor an ESA. The state is negotiating the safety of eco-fragile zones subverting orders of the judiciary,” said Stalin D, one of the petitioners in the matter.Rathod said final decision on the Dodamarg-Sawantwadi belt will be reconsidered. “We are aware of the HC order and the matter will be placed before the CM for final decision,” he said.Also, Savarde village in the core zone of Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary in Kolhapur, Maloshi and Bamnoli villages in Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary in Satara, and Yelan Gai marked as mining village in the buffer area of the Sahayadri Tiger Reserve among others, were all excluded.“This has remained a controversial issue ever since the 2011 Madhav Gadgil committee report. The state needs to ensure biodiversity is not compromised while finalising ESA boundaries,” said Kishor Rithe, former member of National Board for Wildlife.WHAT IS AN ESA?Declaring an area as ESA means putting restriction on mining, quarrying, thermal power plants, setting up of industries and construction to ensure buffer areas of a protected zone, in this case, the Western Ghats, remains protected.(With inputs from Surendra Gangan)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-wants-2-092-villages-in-eco-sensitive-zone-but-excludes-wildlife-corridors/story-hL2VRohgOjnJEr0qectZtO.html

The accused have been identified as Punnan Singh, sarpanch of Baba Gamchak Abadi in Ballarwal village; Beant Singh, sarpanch of Soahn Singh Abadi in Ballarwal village; and Shindi and her son Sonu of Sohan Singh Abadi. Ajnala SHO inspector Satish Kumar, said Ballarwal village has four panchayats. “Both Punnan Singh and Beant Singh owe allegiance to the ruling Congres. Even the former sarpanch who was killed was a Congress worker,” he said. The case has been registered on the complaint of the deceased’s son-in-law Malkiat Singh, of Sarangdev Channa village. “My father-in-law had been in illegal relationship with his brother-in-law’s wife Shindi for last 25 years. On Wednesday, at around 2 pm, Maur Singh had gone to meet Shindi at her home in the same village. I got a call from one Jagir Singh of the same village informing me that my father-in-law was being beaten by the four accused,” he said in the complaint.He added, “When I and Jagir Singh reached outside Shindi’s home, we saw Punnan Singh and Beant Singh coming out. When we went inside the home, we found Shindi and her son changing the clothes of my father-in-law, who was lying in a bed in an unconscious condition. After seeing us, Shindi and her son Sonu fled. We immediately rushed Maur Singh to a private hospital in Ajnala, where he was declared brought dead.”The SHO said they have registered a case against the accused under Sections 302 (murder) and 120 (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. Meanwhile, the deceased’s nephew Baljit Singh alleged that both the sitting sarpanches had been keeping a grudge against his uncle since the last panchayat polls.According to Malkiat Singh, Maur Singh remained sarpanch of Baba Gamchak Abadi for one term (from 2013-18). “In 2018 panchayat polls, my uncle was defeated by Punnan Singh,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-cong-sarpanches-among-4-booked-for-killing-ex-sarpanch-in-amritsar/story-IQE2IBwzGGwI5Snwxijo3I.html

PROJECTS FOR ADVANCED CAREThe mother and child care centre is a 300-bed unit for improving obstetric and neonatal tertiary care. The plan includes neonatal intensive care unit with advanced services, foetal medicine unit, robotic surgery, human milk bank, advanced infertility services and reproductive endocrinology. The centre will also act as a skill training centre for health professionals and is expected to contribute to bringing down prenatal and neonatal mortality rates in the region.The neurosciences centre, also a 300-bed facility, will help offer timely, affordable and advanced treatment for neurological and neuroscience disorders.

They demanded that their services should be restored as they are unable to feed their children.Kurukshetra deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Ajay Rana said, “The Safai Karamcharis had been protesting outside the KDB office for two-three days. On Thursday, we removed them as they refused to end the protest despite repeated requests.”Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) leader Yogesh Sharma, who was leading the protesters, accused the KDB management of misleading the sweepers by making false promises. “These workers should be re-appointed without any delay,” he said.“Our prime minister was seen washing the feet of the sweepers, but here, our job was taken, leaving us with nothing”, said a protestor.However, KDB chief executive officer Gagandeep Singh said, “The sweepers are not associated with the KDB. They are contractual employees working with Sulabh International, which has been given the contract of cleanliness at the religious places in Kurukshetra and surrounding areas. But now the contract has been given to the Radha Krishan Society, who had reduced their strength.”A top-level official from the KDB said that the new contractor has agreed to reappoint 30 of the sacked workers, but they were adamant with their demand that all 70 of them should be reappointed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sacked-safai-karamcharis-protest-in-kurukshetra-removed-by-police/story-8eKrd6sP3qg5eoaIEbe45N.html

Kantilal Kadu, president of Panvel Sangharsh Samiti, said, “Ganesh Deshmukh was doing good work in containing the spread of Covid-19.” Deshmukh took the charge a Panvel municipal commissioner in April 2018. “He ensured that social distancing is followed during lockdown and violators are punished. The virus was controlled in the slum pockets of Panvel. At this juncture, it was unfair to transfer him and we want him to be reinstated as Panvel civic commissioner,” said Kadu.Manohar Shinde, 40, a Kharghar resident, said, “Ganesh Deshmukh was taking measures to improve garbage collection too. He was handling the coronavirus outbreak efficiently.”Many activists have joined residents in demanding reinstating Ganesh Deshmukh.“There has been no evidence of community spread of Covid-19 even in the slum pockets of the city,” said Deepak Singh, a Kharghar activist, who too has written to the Chief Minister’s Office to bring back Ganesh Deshmukh.“He got in touch with NGOs and individuals to ensure that all migrants have food during lockdown,” said Singh.Panvel MLA Prashant Thakur too has opposed the transfer. “Deshmukh has been targeted and his transfer is politically motivated. He was doing good work to contain the disease in the PCMC area. He should be brought back to the city,” said Thakur.Ganesh Deshmukh, who is now additional commissioner of Thane Municipal Corporation, said, “I am really moved by the residents’ gesture but I have taken over my new responsibility.”In 2018, Panvel residents had protested over the transfer of the then municipal commissioner Sudhakar Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panvel-residents-want-ganesh-deshmukh-back-as-civic-chief/story-FTtHrs2HWdFDQD72HTAPrK.html
21-05-2020||City||AIIMS Bathinda construction to be further hit as 50% labourers go home||With nearly 50% (800) of 1,600 migrant workers involved in the construction of Indoor Patient Departments (IPDs), residential and teaching blocks at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bathinda, going back to their native states, the opening of these facilities may be indefinitely delayed. Originally, these services were to start from November this year. Officials say there is only half of the usual workforce at the construction site on the Dabwali Road these days, with the labourers returning to Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh. A visit to the site on Thursday showed work was on, but at a slow pace. A senior functionary of the private firm undertaking the work said construction had been pushed back by at least six months, as several other migrant workers had announced that they would go back. “The district administration has given strict instructions that those wanting to leave for their native places will not be asked to stay back. Due to the pandemic, skilled workers from other states are not keen to join work. We have no option than to wait and watch till the pandemic eases,” said the official, who is not authorised to speak to the media.“Due to the lockdown, supply of fly ash, an important construction ingredient, produced from coal-based thermal power generation plants had dropped significantly,” said another official of the construction firm.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone of the AIIMS project on November 25, 2016 and classes for the first batch of MBSS started from August 26 last year at the institute’s temporary campus in Faridkot-based Guru Gobind Singh Medical College, which is under Baba Farid University of Health Sciences. Outpatient department (OPD) services were started on December 23.Medical superintendent Dr Satish Gupta, who is also the dean, expressed his reservations on whether all healthcare services, including IPD, trauma and emergency services can commence from November this year. “We are reviewing arrangements to see if MBBS classes for the forthcoming batch can be started from September onwards at the Bathinda campus. Student hostel is almost complete and classes may be started, as a temporary measure, from the OPD block. We are assessing the situation,” said Gupta. On Thursday, another group of about 30 workers were ready to go to UP on a special bus. Radhey Sharma from UP’s Maharajganj and Vikas from Girdih in Jharkhand said their jobs were safe and contractors provided them with dry ration during the lockdown.“We wish to be with our families and we would like to resume work in Bathinda when the pandemic crisis is over,” said another worker Aryan.Deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said besides special trains to Bihar and Jharkhand, 4-5 buses with workers from AIIMS sites had left for Bihar and West Bengal. He added there had been no complaint of non-payment of wages at AIIMS sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aiims-bathinda-construction-to-be-further-hit-as-50-labourers-go-home/story-CZ4fJL2LVpqIQMSh8QGCUN.html

As per the schedule, summer vacation for colleges will start from June 1 till June 30, unless there are any changes made by the state government with respect to lockdown guidelines. Terminating semester examinations will take place from July 1 onwards, as per the schedule.“The summer vacations will take place from 1 June till 30 June or as per instructions received from the state government, if there is any change,” states the notification issued by MDU.However, so far, there is no clarity on how exams will be conducted. Officials in the university, however, said that holding online examination seemed difficult and in all likelihood, offline examination will be conducted. Pooja Khullar, principal of Dronacharya Government College, said that all colleges affiliated to MDU are supposed to abide by the schedule issued for the semester, unless there is any new development or change in the state policy. “The controller of examination has told us that the schedule issued will be followed unless there is another development with respect to lockdown guidelines. We have also been told that there will be no online exams and there is a possibility of holding exams with physical distancing in July for students who are in the final semester or those who need to reappear,” said Khullar. She added that specific directions regarding the July examinations were awaited.Satyamanyu Yadav, principal of Government College in Sector 9, said that examinations would be conducted for students in their final years in July as per MDU’s notification. “So far, we have been told that exams will be conducted only for final year students in different courses in July. The notification has been shared with teachers, who have been asked to ensure that all students are made aware of the vacation and examination schedule,” said Yadav. ML Batra, assistant registrar, MDU, said that more details and rules pertaining to examinations were expected to be out by next week. “The possibility of conducting examination online is less. In all likelihood, it might take place in the physical setup by practising norms of social distancing, but there is no final word as of now. We are abiding by the UGC guidelines and more clarity on ways of conducting examination should emerge in due course of time,” said Batra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mdu-issues-examination-vacation-schedule-for-city-colleges/story-Im34jbejB3NfIDcILE1RhI.html

He paid ₹8,000 in advance to an agent who promised to ferry him and his family to West Bengal for a total of ₹20,000. On Tuesday late night, when they were on their way in a bus with other migrant workers, a team of police personnel stopped them near Sarai village in New Palam Vihar and told them they can’t go further as the bus driver did not have a movement pass.On Wednesday, the police booked four men and the bus driver for allegedly collecting money from migrant workers to ferry them to their home towns in West Bengal.“I have not earned anything since the day lockdown was implemented. For weeks, I had been waiting for a way to get out of here and go to my home town. Recently, I got in touch with an agent who agreed to take us to our home in a bus for ₹5,000 per passenger. I immediately arranged the money,” Rafiq said. Rafiq, who has a four-year-old son and a six-year-old daughter, used to work as a daily wager in Gurugram.As migrant workers, whose source of income has dried up due to the lockdown, are trying all possible ways to return to their home states, instances of them being cheated by agents promising them safe journeys have been on the rise. In most cases, agents, bus drivers or truck drivers, are charging them between ₹2,300 and ₹5,000 for ferrying them to their home states, without the requisite passes. At least four such incidents have been reported in May, so far.Mahbub ul Haq, one of the migrants was making his way back home on Tuesday, said, “There were around 27 persons, including women and children, from whom the men had taken ₹5,000 each for the journey. They informed us that they have all the necessary documents for inter-state travel. Around 11.30pm on Tuesday, we reached Sarai Allwardi village near the Dwarka Expressway, from where a bus picked us up. As soon as we began travelling, a team of police personnel intercepted the vehicle.”“The police left us on the road and went away, despite there being women and children, as young as seven-month-olds, with us. They did not even arrest the bus driver. I had taken a loan of ₹25,000 at 10% interest in order to return to my home town in West Bengal. I have not earned anything since the lockdown started,” Mahbub said. He said that they were stranded at the spot for the whole night, until the police reached the spot again around 6am on Wednesday. However, the police denied the allegation and said that the migrant workers did not want to go to a relief camp. Mahbub and his family are currently staying at a construction site in K-block, South City-1.Mool Chand, sub-inspector (SI), Bajghera police station, said, “As per the protocol, we had asked the migrant workers and their families to shift to a relief camp. However, they did not want to shift. The accused are yet to be arrested. We are investigating the matter.”A case was registered under sections 118 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act at Bajghera police station on Wednesday.Last week, the police had arrested two men in Ashok Vihar Phase-3, who had allegedly collected ₹1.25 lakh from 53 migrant workers for ferrying them to West Bengal. Similar incidents were reported at the Sector 14 and Sector 5 police stations earlier in the month.Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “Whenever such incidents have come to light, we have taken swift action and arrested the accused persons. The administration has been providing buses and trains for the migrant workers to return to their home states and towns.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/migrants-who-paid-5-000-each-for-journey-home-to-west-bengal-stranded-midway/story-GxXLql3RccyFOYlWReqO3K.html

The group said that they live at Carterpuri and Mulahera areas and often end up sleeping in a park in the area.Most of these daily wagers belong to Bihar. After the lockdown was imposed, the district administration appointed nodal authorities for food distribution – both dry food and cooked meal.Manju Devi, who worked as a maid and whose husband worked as a construction labourer, said, “We gave our Aadhaar numbers to some officials and they assured us that they were noting down our name to make a list of people to whom dry food — such as rice, flour, pulses — will be distributed. We have no idea who they (the officials) were but we have not received any dry ration so far.”In the government’s absence, the RWA members of Sector 23-A have been helping these workers by providing them with meals twice daily.“I am a rickshaw puller. My son is a construction labourer and my wife works as maid. My son has two children. We all live in two small rooms at Carterpuri. Before the lockdown, we managed to earn Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 thousand a month. But after the lockdown, our incomes dried up. We have a hand to mouth existence as of now. We have not paid rent to our landlord for three months. We go to a temple at Sector 23-A twice a day to collect cooked meal with the help of local RWA and some other Good Samaritans. We hope the administration provides us dry ration soon, so that we can cook for ourselves,” said Sitaram Das, tone of the daily wage earners. On Wednesday, the RWA members wrote a letter to deputy commissioner (DC), Gurugram, Amit Khatri, seeking his intervention and demanding a probe as to why these daily wagers were not provided with ration despite a survey having been done in April..“We have also raised this issue repeatedly on WhatsApp group created by 15 different RWAs of city. There has been no response from the officials so far. If a survey has been done, then they should be provided dry food packets. How long will they have to beg and stand in line at temple sites?,” said Neeru Yadav, RWA president of Sector 23-A.Contacted, deputy commissioner Khatri said he was looking into the issueVinay Pratap Singh, MCG commissioner, said, “I will arrange dry food ration for them immediately and look if a survey was done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/provide-food-or-send-us-home-150-stuck-migrants-appeal-to-district-administration/story-arjr76AoTf7SaNLI9e0BII.html
21-05-2020||Gurugram||Domestic helps allowed entry, park access allowed on odd-even basis||Domestic helps will be allowed in all residential areas, except in containment zones, according to the latest guidelines issued by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Thursday evening. Another key point of the guideline is the implementation of an odd-even rule for walks in common areas and parks.Domestic helps will have to mandatorily wear face masks, undergo thermal screening at entrances and use hand sanitisers placed at the gates, according to the guidelines.The order by MCG commissioner, Vinay Pratap Singh, a copy of which is with HT, further stated that residents should make arrangements for the stay of domestic helps inside their houses, if possible, “to avoid their daily movement from their place of residence.”Singh clarified that the making stay arrangements are recommended but not a mandatory instruction. He, however, said that residents’ welfare associations cannot permit entry of domestic helps residing in containment zones. Also, domestic helps are also not allowed to work for employers in containment zones.The entry of domestic helps has been a point of contention between RWAs and residents since relaxations were issued when the third phase of the lockdown began.The entry of domestic helps into residential areas varied with each condominium, society, plotted colonies, or residential sector, depending on the RWA’s decision. A few RWAs had also issued notices to residents, stating that domestic helps can be allowed only if they have been tested for coronavirus.In its order, the MCG has stated that they would take action against office bearers of RWAs if they do not comply with their directions.Singh’s order also stated that walks in common areas and parks is now permitted, albeit with restrictions. RWAs have been asked to allow residents of odd-numbered houses to walk in the morning and allow those in even-numbered houses to take walks in the evening, between 7am and 7pm, to avoid crowding and ensure social distancing.“RWAs to adhere to the guidelines issued by the government in letter and spirit, failing which penal provisions as given in MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs) notifications will be attracted against the responsible office bearers of the RWAs,” the order by Singh stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/domestic-helps-allowed-entry-park-access-allowed-on-odd-even-basis/story-av7AWBIb4H7cUnzdaxeXHI.html

Her family members alleged she was refused admission by the Civil Hospital in Gurugram and was referred to Faridabad due to lack of facilities for pregnant women at the government hospital.The woman gave birth to a girl in the 38th week of her pregnancy and the child has tested negative for coronavirus. It was a normal delivery, said doctors at the Faridabad hospital.Dr Asim Das, Dean, ESIC Medical College and Hospital, Faridabad, said the patient was referred by Gurugram’s Civil Hospital and within three hours, the patient delivered the baby. “The newborn has tested negative for the infection. She is healthy and doing well, as of now,” he said.Das said it was against guidelines that a patient travels in their personal vehicle after being referred by a government hospital. “She was rushed to the hospital by her husband and the patient was panicking. She was immediately admitted and was taken to the labour room,” he said.The doctor said the mother is fine and though she has tested positive for COVID-19, she is asymptomatic at present. She is more in shock, he said.The woman’s husband said he had taken her for a routine checkup on Tuesday at a nursing home, where they suggested she undergo a test for Covid-19, which the doctors said was mandatory. “Her samples were collected and everything was normal, so we returned home. On Wednesday, we received a call from the nursing home that she has tested positive and that she had to be admitted to the Civil Hospital,” he said.He said they rushed but the Civil Hospital refused to admit her and referred her to ESIC Hospital in Faridabad instead, as they were not fully equipped to deal with pregnant patients and deliveries.“We were refused admission at 5.30pm and my wife started experiencing pain. It was the most challenging phase of my life. Without wasting time, I drove towards Faridabad and I tried to pacify my wife who was tense and was crying throughout,” said the husband.He said doctors at Civil Hospital told them they do not have a separate labour room for Covid-19 patients.The hospital’s principal medical officer, Deepa Sindhu, did not respond to calls seeking comment.However, Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, Gurugram said Covid-19 pregnant patients from now will be admitted to the Sector 31 polyclinic. “It is a 30-bed facility where we have made arrangements for expecting mothers. Those who are admitted in Faridabad will continue with their treatment there, while new cases from the district will be admitted at the polyclinic,” he said. He added he was unaware that the patient was referred to FaridabadThe ESIC hospital in Faridabad has a protocol dedicated to the care of Covid-19 pregnant patients and has separate cubicles for pregnant women along with operation theatres and labour room, said Das.The ESIC dean said that guidelines issued by the Centre for infants born to a Covid-19-positive mother should be tested within 24 hours of birth. If the baby’s initial sample is negative, another sample should be taken after 48 hours. The samples of the baby born Wednesday would again be drawn on Friday for second testing, Das said.The hospital has conducted more than six such deliveries in the past month, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-s-civil-hospital-refers-covid-positive-pregnant-woman-to-faridabad-due-to-lack-of-facilities/story-ws460WTAI0jPmjZeRHmbKO.html
21-05-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram keeps case count, fatalities below ‘red zone’ limits||At 239, Gurugram district has the highest number of coronavirus cases in the state. Despite this, it is not in the Red Zone -- an area-wise categorisation that would entail strict restrictions-- as it was within the “critical limits” set by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country’s apex biomedical research body.On Wednesday the Haryana state government declared all 22 districts in the Orange Zone, one step below Red Zone and one above Green Zone (which has nearly nil cases). On May 18, the central government, while extending the lockdown a third time till the end of the month, had given greater say to states to decide on which areas fall under Red, Orange and Green zone categories.According to them, weekly reviews of certain parameters like active cases, doubling rate among others, will be carried out to further categorise districts into different colour codes.Six parameters – total active case, active case per 100,000 population, doubling rate, case fatality rate, testing ratio (number of tests per 100,000 population), and sample positivity rate – with critical and desirable limits to colour code districts has been set by the ICMR, India’s apex medical research body.Gurugram, said additional chief secretary (health) Rajeev Arora, was below critical limit for each of the six parameters. “These are important for monitoring Covid-19 prevalence across all the districts. Since there has been an ease in the lockdown, the data analysis will tell us about the impact on the Covid-19 situation. Every week, will be monitoring districts on the six parameters and take action accordingly. It is a dynamic process,” said Arora. According to him, the next review will be on May 25. Total active cases are the number of Covid-19 patients hospitalised. As per the ICMR, the situation is critical if it exceeds 200. In Gurugram, 95 are under treatment, while 131 have recovered and discharged and the rest do not require hospitalisation.Dr. Sudha Garg, district surveillance officer, said, “We are discharging patients after taking their samples on the tenth day of their treatment. The reports are received in a day or two after which the patient is discharged. As per revised guidelines, we are doing only one confirmatory test before releasing a patient.” Earlier, Covid-19 patients were discharged after two confirmatory tests.This number is arrived by taking into consideration the 2011 census. As per ICMR guideline, the limit is 15.In Gurugram, the number has come down from 7.40 on May 15 to 6.27 on May 20. Ashok Meena, officer incharge for state’s Covid-19 data, who is also CEO Ayushman Bharat and commissioner, food and drugs department,, said, “It doesn’t mean we are not testing people. It is a parameter to check the extent of coronavirus spread in the overall population, which is currently under control.”It estimates the number of days it takes for number of cases to double. An increasing doubling rate, therefore, means fewer days until the total number of cases doubles. It is calculated over a seven-day period. The doubling rate till May 8 was almost seven days. It, however, slowed to 15 on May 15 and in the last two days, it has further slowed to 17.Testing RatioIt is one of the important factors in categorising, directly or indirectly impacting other parameters. Testing ratio is the number of tests per 100,000 population. It is critical situation if less than 65. According to government data, testing ratio in Gurugram has increased from 582 to 661 in the last few days. “Besides contact tracing, our focus has been on the vulnerable population who are at higher risk of exposure to the coronavirus. Be it symptomatic or asymptomatic, samples are being taken for RT-PCR to check the community spread,” said Arora.ICMR requires the fatality rate (number of deaths per case expressed as percentage) to be below 6% and that it is desirable that it be less than 1. The first death in Gurugram was recorded on May 21. Till date, other deaths reported in a few private city hospitals and the sector 10 Civil Hospital were patients from other states. According to health officials, these deaths are included in Covid-19 death list of the respective states.It is the confirmation rate of the samples taken and the desirable number should be less than 2%. ICMR guidelines states it becomes critical if it exceeds 6%. Data from May 15 shows the sample positivity rate fluctuated between 0.26% to 2.46%. “The numbers are increasing as the testing is increasing with focus on high risk contact. Still, it is below the threshold mark,” said Meena.Dr. Preeti Kumar, vice president, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) said, “Most of the indicators for Gurugram are higher than the state average like the active cases per lakh population and sample positivity rate.Gurugram’s sample positivity rate shows the infection has not yet spread, which is also clear from the doubling rate figure. The case fatality ratio, on the other hand, is impressive as it reflects people have reached for clinical services with the onset symptoms and second there are enough health facilities to look after these patients. ”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-keeps-case-count-fatalities-below-red-zone-limits/story-m9TItFyjSDcjF7UqvgnLHN.html

Kurukshetra superintendent of police (SP) Astha Modi has also ordered suspension of the duo and formed a special investigation team (SIT) in the case to be headed by Kurukshetra deputy SP. As per the information, the liquor cases were found missing during a special inspection of godowns in the district. The missing boxes of illegal liquor were recovered in 2016. SP Astha Modi said, “Two malkhana moharar (current and former in-charge), have been booked under Section 409 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code.” The SP said during the checking of the stock, some liquor cases were found missing and a preliminary investigation was ordered, which revealed that the suspended cops were in-charge of the malkhana at the time of theft. She said future course of action will depend on the findings of the SIT’s report. About the details of the accused cops, the SP said since an SIT was investigating the case, their identities cannot be disclosed. Liquor going missing from the police possession has emerged as a major issue in Haryana following the ban on the sale of liquor during the lockdown. Four Yamunanagar policemen, including station house officer of Radaur, were also suspended in connection with the alleged misappropriation of seized illegal liquor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/396-liquor-boxes-go-missing-from-k-shetra-police-station-2-cops-booked/story-Ewr09hKxNcqhaKpTDYAhGM.html
21-05-2020||Gurugram||Toll collection at KMP expressway to start from Friday||The Haryana State Industrial & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (HSIIDC) is likely to start toll collection at the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) expressway from Friday morning. HSIIDC had stopped collecting toll at the 11 toll points located on the KMP expressway during the lockdown period implemented in March by the central government to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the country.HSIIDC officials said that all arrangements are in place for toll collection to restart. Vipin Sharma, head of the department, KMP expressway, HSIIDC, said, “We’ll start collecting toll at KMP expressway from Friday. Traffic on the road has started increasing so we thought we should resume collecting toll.”Officials said that they have laid out a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) for the operators at the toll plaza, wherein booth operators have to maintain a social distance from commuters. Booth operators will also have to sanitise cash using heat blowers before putting it in the cash register. Navneet Singh, CEO, Skylark, which has a revenue assurance contract with HSIIDC at KMP expressway, said, “We have instructed our 300 toll operators on the expressway to keep enough distance from commuters.” Just like the Kherki-Daula toll plaza in Gurugram, booth operators at KMP expressway will blow-dry cash bills to sanitise them. “We have given toll operators tongs and plastic baskets to take cash from commuters so that they can maintain enough distance from them,” Singh added. All toll checkpoints have been sanitised and the booth operators taught how to maintain hygiene during this period, a toll official said.The ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) had shut all toll plazas in the country from March 25 to April 19, following which it reopened them after relaxations issued by the Centre. Even though the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) toll plazas became operational in April itself, HSIIDC has decided to resume toll operations from Friday. The 135.6 km KMP expressway became fully operational in 2018 and covers five districts—Sonepat, Jhajjar, Gurugram, Mewat and Palwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/toll-collection-at-kmp-expressway-to-start-from-friday/story-CVqba7WHJEVd1JNZx2LOkL.html
21-05-2020||Gurugram||Waterlogging complaint on social media resolved after 10 months||Ten months after a social worker highlighted issues of waterlogging and subsequent mosquito breeding at the Kadipur Industrial Area on social media, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) finally resolved and responded to his grievance on Tuesday night.On July 12, 2019, after a brief spell of rains, Raj Saini Bisarwal, a social worker, had highlighted the problem of waterlogging in Kadipur, raising concerns over vector-borne diseases. He had also attached photos of the waterlogged area and marked several public bodies, including the MCG, on the tweet.At the time, his post had also drawn the attention of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which directed the MCG to take action on the complaint.Despite the directions, it was only at 10pm on Tuesday night that the MCG finally replied to the complaint by stating “it (the matter) has been resolved” via its official twitter handle, along with photos of the spot, which showed empty streets with no water accumulation.“Last week, I received a call from a junior engineer of the MCG regarding my July 2019 complaint. He first asked me whether my complaint had been resolved and then subsequently asked me for details on it. The next time I received a communication from the MCG was on a tweet on Tuesday night. The whole exercise was pointless as monsoon has not yet started and the roads are dry anyway,” said Bisarwal.As per an MCG official privy to the matter said the Kadipur Industrial Area was under the jurisdiction of the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) until early this year, when the area was partially transferred to the MCG, following which the civic body has started initiating action.“Most parts of Kadipur Industrial Area were unapproved and hence, no civic amenities were being provided there until recently. In December last year, the Haryana government had initiated a survey to regularise over 5,000 industries located in unapproved areas and subsequently, provide them with the civic benefits. After the completion of the survey, we identified around 400 industries in Kadipur area and have started extending civic benefits in the locality since March,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/waterlogging-complaint-on-social-media-resolved-after-10-months/story-kzW99AJUIC4KZx914PfmxL.html

Most of the remaining ones are likely to be released in the next 10 days as and when they complete their quarantine period, the statement said.Additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi said the Tablighi Jamaat members, who completed 21 days of quarantine in hospitals or quarantine facilities, were being released after screening. Those among the Jamaatis, who were taken into custody, were being released after bail from court, he said.In Meerut, a total of 296 Tablighi Jamaat members were released from different quarantine centers on Thursday, an official and a public representative said.They had spent about 50 days in these centres, Samajwadi Party MLA Rafeeq Ansari claimed.Chief medical officer Dr Rajkumar said the quarantine period for anyone could be a maximum of 28 days but they (the Tablighi Jamaat members) were kept for a longer time because the district administration was waiting for guidelines for their release. “All of them are now (Sars-Cov-2) negative and can celebrate Eid with their families,” the chief medical officer said.These Tablighi Jamaat members were quarantined after they attended a religious programme at Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi and visited different locations from there.The mid-March Islamic religious discourse was attended by thousands of Jamaat members including hundreds of foreigners, and had triggered concerns about a nationwide spike in coronavirus cases.Thirty-three of these Tablighi Jamaat members belong to Uttar Pradesh, nine to Haryana, 44 to Jharkhand, 55 to Assam, 10 to Maharashtra, 10 to Andhra Pradesh, 38 to West Bengal, 86 to Bihar, nine to Manipur and two to Delhi, according to information provided by the SP MLA. Those from UP belong to Banda, Hathras, Noida (Gautam Buddha Nagar) and Azamgarh districts. Ansari, who represents the Meerut city constituency, said, “I had been contacting every official to ensure their release for the past one month. Finally, they were released after spending over 50 days in their respective quarantine centres.” Ansari claimed he arranged vehicles to send them back to their villages and towns so that they could be reunited with families ahead of Eid. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MP from Amroha Kunwar Danish Ali said he sent a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath on May 15, demanding the release of those people who have completed 21 days in quarantine centres.Ali said several people were illegally quarantined in Amroha for more than 45 days. He urged the chief minister that they be immediately sent home.One Hafizullah, who was among those in quarantine in Amroha, died of a heart attack, Ali alleged. Hafizullah was a resident of Ambedkar Nagar. It was only after Hafizullah’s death that the district administration swung into action and all people staying in quarantine were released and sent home, the BSP MP said.He also said the family members of those who had “illegally detained” in quarantine centres contacted him. People were facing a similar situation in various districts of UP, he said. Ali said he contacted additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi and urged him to send these people home without any further delay or else those with illnesses might meet the same fate as Hafizullah in Amroha.The release of people from quarantine centers will not only provide relief to their family members, who are mentally disturbed for the past 50 days, but also reduce the burden on the administration, he said.The additional chief secretary assured Ali that necessary action will be taken in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/ahead-of-eid-up-releases-over-600-tablighi-jamaat-members-from-quarantine/story-StISgzeTvCYTJZpCHlbsOP.html

21-05-2020||City||Amid job crisis, youth queue up to volunteer at Covid-19 isolation centre||While most people are confining themselves within their homes amid the Covid-19 outbreak, jobless youth in Ludhiana came in large numbers to apply for the post of volunteers at the isolation wards on Wednesday.The volunteers, mostly women, including paramedical staff, were seen jostling among themselves as they queued up outside the enrolment centre at civil surgeon office for registration. A doctor, on the condition of anonymity, said that many BDS (Bachelor of Dental Surgery) graduates had also come to apply for the post.The volunteers are being recruited as daily wagers to meet the manpower shortage emerging in the government hospital during the Covid-19 crises.As social distancing went for a toss completely, the health authorities had to call the police to bring the situating under control.Furious on witnessing the chaotic scenes, civil surgeon Dr Rahesh Bagga was seen yelling at the crowd. Dr Bagga said, “It is sad that we had to call the police to control the situation. These youngsters, who are educated enough, should realise the importance of maintaining social distance. But they did not bother.”Dr Bagga also said that while applicants were jostling with each other, their family members went one step ahead. They were seen assembling against the wall to catch a glimpse of the training centre.“Nearly two to five family members were accompanying one applicant. It was as if they were visiting a shopping mall. This is bizarre. People should not take undue advantage of government relaxation,” said Dr Bagga.Dr Bagga reportedly lambasted the staff for failing to manage the crowd.“The applicants should be given tokens to avoid chaos at the enrolment counter,” said Dr Bagga.On the other hand, the youngsters standing in queue said that they were badly in need of a job.“I need a job to help my family in tiding over the financial crises. The government is offering a good amount of money to volunteers on a daily basis. I did not want to lose this opportunity. Yes, there was rush but everyone needs a job these days,” said Gurpreet Kaur, one of the applicants.Another woman, who got married recently, said that due to the lockdown, her family’s savings were drying up. “My family is in desperate need of money and despite being a trained paramedic, I am sitting at home. As soon as I found about this job, I came here to try my luck,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-job-crisis-youth-queue-up-to-volunteer-at-covid-19-isolation-centre/story-gWVIg19IovtUNcxABM72rJ.html
21-05-2020||Delhi||Lack of social distancing in Tihar jail not a valid reason to seek bail: HC||The Delhi High Court has said that a lack of social distancing, by itself, may not be valid grounds for inmates of the Tihar jail to seek interim bail, as there is no reported case of Covid-19 within the boundaries of the jail. The court, while rejecting an inmate’s bail application, also said that jails are more secure since they are insulated from outside human traffic.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rajnish Bhatnagar noted that in several status reports, they have been informed that although it may not be possible to maintain social distancing norms in jails, masks are being provided to the inmates.“We have called for status reports in several other similar cases, and we have been informed that though it may not be possible to maintain social distancing norms in jails, masks are being provided to the inmates. By their very nature, jails are more protected areas since they are insulated from outside human traffic. Therefore, a lack of social distancing norms, by itself, may not be grounds to seek interim bail when there is no reported case of Covid-19 within the four walls of the jail (Tihar),” the court said.The order was issued while hearing a plea by an inmate, who had sought bail. It was contended that the incarceration of the appellant has led to his wife suffering from anxiety, due to which he should be released on interim bail. The court, rejecting this claim, said that if this submission was to be accepted, then such a reason would be presented as an argument to seek interim or regular bail in every case where a convict is undergoing a life sentence or long-term sentence.“In our view, unless there is some material to show that the appellant’s (accused) wife is undergoing some significant psychological or mental illness, the plea cannot be considered for grant of interim bail,” the court said in the order, dated May 20.The counsel for the jail had told the court that there is no reported case of Covid-19 in the Tihar jail, where the accused has been lodged. She further told the court that, on inquiry, it was found that the inmate’s wife is living alone but could not produce any document to show that she is undergoing treatment for anxiety, which is grounds to seek interim bail.Meanwhile, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday also directed the jail superintendent, Central jail, Rohini, to look into the complaint of a prisoner who had alleged harassment by three inmates, in collusion with the police officials. Advocate Kamna Vohra, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, refuted the allegations, stating that there is no proof to substantiate the “bald” claims made the family members of the accused. The court said even though there is merit in the submissions of the counsel, the superintendent would look into the matter and in case it is found that he was/is being ill-treated or harassed by the inmates or any jail officer, take appropriate action against them and provide the inmate necessary protection and medical treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lack-of-social-distancing-in-tihar-jail-not-a-valid-reason-to-seek-bail-hc/story-kULuBxALQ5cWonSUARQy2O.html
21-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC allows burial of a Christian Covid-19 victim||On Thursday morning, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) allowed burial of a Christian, who died of Covid-19, at a designated cemetery. This is the first burial of a Covid-19 victim from the Christian community as other victims were cremated as per protocol.The 74-year-old woman from Dharavi passed away at SevenHills Hospital on Wednesday and was buried at Deonar Municipal Christian cemetery.“Over the past 60 days, there have been 11 cremations. On Wednesday, despite BMC order, Sewri cemetery refused burial to the body. Then we tried contacting other cemeteries and the burial took place at Deonar,” said Cyril Dara, a church activist.However, Sewri cemetery authorities were unavailable for comments.A BMC official, who co-ordinated the burial, said in a normal situation burials take place within ward premises, but in situation such as this, permissions are required from higher authorities. The development comes after the civic body issued a circular designating four cemeteries for Christians, two for Chinese and one for Jewish community.On Tuesday, HT was the first to report about the death of 61-year-old woman from Mahim on Sunday. Her family had to cremate her body after being denied burial at several cemeteries on the grounds that the woman had died of Covid-19.Following which, members of the Christian community contended that according to their religious practices a body cannot be cremated and needs to be buried and that forced cremations hurt their religious sentiments.Last month, BMC had allowed burial of Covid-19 victims within city limits, provided the ground is large enough to ensure there is no threat of transmission to the residents of the area. However, only 20 Muslim cemeteries were allotted for burials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-allows-burial-of-a-christian-covid-19-victim/story-MmgAKijbjPsFeG6THcQ8jI.html
21-05-2020||City||As life limps back to normal in Ludhiana, sanitisation drive takes a back seat||At a time when the state government has lifted curfew and people have started thronging Ludhiana markets, sanitisation drive was missing in the city. Ludhiana municipal corporation had deployed nine machines, including two fire tenders, to disinfect the main roads of the city in April first week, however, now when most of the sectors had been opened, no machine could be seen on the main roads. Chaura Bazar, Saban Bazar, electronics market and other areas have been witnessing huge rush of visitors. The movement of migrant workers has also increased and labourers in large numbers could be seen at railway station road, Giaspura, Focal Point, Tajpur rod and other areas. In several wards of the city, sanitisation drive of the internal streets has also come to a halt. Ludhiana mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu said that two backpack machines were given to each councillor of the city to undertake disinfection drive.Leader of opposition in the general house of municipal corporation and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) councillor, Harbhajan Singh Dang, said, “Disinfection drive was being done in his ward until two weeks back, but since then no MC employee has turned up for the job.” SAD councilor, ward number 17, Jasmeet Kaur, said that the civic body adopts lackadaisical approach when it comes to disinfecting the city roads. “Not even handy backpack machines were provided to me and threat of residents getting infected with Covid-19 looms large over them. The civic body should have rather intensified the sanitisation drive when the markets were witnessing huge rush,” said Kaur, adding that many councillors are forced to use their own machinery and money for sanitising their wards. A MC employee, requesting anonymity, said the drive was stopped since the state government lifted the curfew on May 17. “The MC employees were facing problem in disinfecting the roads owing to large number of people thronging the market places. We cannot spray chemical on them. The officials were planning to take up the disinfection process during night hours or early morning hours, however, no final decision has been taken in this regard so far,” he added. Krishma, a resident of BRS Nagar, E-block, said, “MC employees were disinfecting the internal roads and entry gates of the houses in April, but the drive had been put to a halt for a long time now. Sanitisation process should be taken up on regular basis, especially in the internal areas to stop the spread of the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-life-limps-back-to-normal-in-ludhiana-sanitisation-drive-takes-a-back-seat/story-3C8jOHP8L1lUZQEXr2Vh4K.html
21-05-2020||City||TMC forms ward-level panel to tackle Covid||After Wednesday’s single-day jump of 110 coronavius cases in Thane, the municipal corporation has decided to implement the Baramati pattern to fight the increasing number of infections in the city. Baramati imposed a strict lockdown after one death and four positive cases were recorded. The central team had applauded the pattern and had urged other districts to follow it.The decision was taken in a standing committee meeting of Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) -- the first one during lockdown -- held on Wednesday. The committee members also asked the corporation to clean and disinfect community toilets in the slums four times a day.The committee blamed the administration for increasing Covid cases in the slums, claiming that the toilets aren’t cleaned, contract tracing is not done properly while people in slums are home-quarantined as centres are full. Till Wednesday, the city had recorded around 1,453 cases, most of which are from the slum areas of Lokmanyanagar Sawarkarnagar, Mumbra, Majiwada and Wagale Estate.NCP corporator Hanumant Jagdale proposed the Baramati pattern in the meeting. “Like in Baramati, ward-level committee consisting of corporators, civic officials, district officers, police officers and rationing officials should be formed. The committee will look at ward-level problems and also help in screening and contact tracing.”All corporators agreed and a committee was formed for Lokmanyanagar ward.Ram Repale, chairman of the committee, said, “We have got complaints about people not getting ambulances on time, the administration has mismanaged the crisis. The community toilets are unclean while people are not quarantined properly. It is essential that the corporators and the corporation work together and form a committee to look at these issues.”Repale gave directives to the administration to ensure that the community toilets are cleaned four times a day. He said, “All contacts of a positive case found in the slums will have to be admitted in quarantine centres. The corporation will have to provide enough manpower for the centres. Asymptomatic Covid patients in the slums cannot be quarantined at home.”The standing committee has said that only 100 tests a day is very less.A TMC official said, “The committee made several suggestions to deal with the pandemic. We will try to implement all of it, especially regarding the sanitation of the community toilets in the slums. The ward-level committee was formed today and the first meeting was held at Lokmanyanagar.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tmc-forms-ward-level-panel-to-tackle-covid/story-Vd6xftgfY6kAwEDMJOXZZL.html

We should now focus on the redevelopment so that such incidents are prevented in the future,” said Awhad.Awhad said Thackeray should now take an immediate decision regarding awarding the project to Seclink Technology Corporation (STC), which had won the bid last year or retender the project. “My only contention is that a decision should be taken to revamp [the slums] and our government should do this urgently,” said Awhad.Currently, Dharavi is a major Covid-19 hotspot where cases are increasing rapidly.The Dharavi redevelopment committee said that at least now the government should take a serious view of the revamp. “We are living in utmost unhygienic conditions in these slums where social distancing in virtually impossible. The Government should now step in the undertake this process on a war footing,” said Raju Korde, president, of the committee.The revamp has faced a lot of problems since its inception in 2004. The two main hurdles were eligibility factor, where 63% people in sector 3 were found non-eligible and the large scale pull-out by the developers because of the government’s flip-flop stance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/awhad-demands-cm-uddhav-to-expedite-dharavi-revamp-project/story-ulNYRe5AQziOO7wqYr11LN.html

My entire family is waiting at home. We could see the train and a token was given to me. I thought, I’m finally going home. And then the officials simply asked us to go back, stating that the train is full,” said Kaimuddin, 40, who works in a private company in Pimpri-Chinchwad and was in the list of Sangvi police station.“I was living in the company where I work. I have left that space because my name appeared in the list. Half of my people are already on the train. I cannot go back to the factory because they will not take us back. What should I do?” asked an exasperated Sagib Alam, 27, who works in a company in Phase 3 of Hinjewadi.Multiple families with children were seen walking out of the station around 2:15pm with bags, buckets, bottles and all the belongings that they could muster up. The state police as well as Railway Protection Force (RPF) officials were escorting them out of the station.“They filled in less people compared to the normal number. We tried to adjust on the trains meant for Pune city police. However, it could not be adjusted. So we are taking them to a temporary shelter in Akurdi where they will spend the night.

21-05-2020||Lucknow||After nearly 2 months, markets off to a sedate start in Lucknow||The plush Hazratganj market resumed operations on Thursday, with some shops open and some closed. Around 55 shops located on one side of the road (on DRM’s office side) were allowed to function as per the guidelines of lockdown 4.0.Markets in Alambagh, Krishna Nagar, Kanpur Road, Indira Nagar and other areas also reopened on ‘alternate day’ basis. According to the arrangement, shops on one side of the market will open one day and the ones on the other side of the road will open the other day.Despite the permission to open, not many traders turned up at Hazratganj market to resume business. Some said the losses were unbearable, while others said they were left with no staff as all workers had moved to their hometowns when the lockdown was announced on March 24. A few shop owners, who couldn’t withstand the losses due to lockdown, initiated permanent closure of their establishments, said a few traders.Sooraj Prakash Kakkar, owner of the 81-year-old British Book Depot, said: “We are reopening after almost two months. Our book depot was established by my father, late Shanti Prakash Kakkar, in 1936 and I am taking care of it since the late 1940s. It’s the first time when this market has seen such a long closure,” said Kakkar, who is in his late seventies. Kakkar said book trade was already in its last leg, and the lockdown had worsened the situation. He said two shops next to his book depot were closed down by the owners due to heavy losses.However, the Hazratganj Traders’ Association said none of the traders had approached them so far, expressing helplessness in running the shops due to losses. “All have suffered losses during lockdown. But so far, no one has approached us expressing inability to run the shop. If that is the case, the trader should approach us. The association is ready to give financial support to such traders. All help will be interest free,” said Kishin Chand Bhambwani, president of Hazratganj Traders’ Association (HTA).Garments, confectionary, sweet shops and other outlets remained open during the day.However, shop owners said there were hardly any buyers as people were not ready to visit the markets yet.“Many shops have reopened after two months and most of the traders are cleaning up their establishments and setting things in order. The customers are missing from the market,” said Nirmal Singh of Nirmal Stationers at LDA Colony, Kanpur road. He added, “We have made arrangements for social distancing. Customers will remain behind the rope, which has been tied near the counter, to avoid direct touch.”“We will allow only two customers at a time, while others can stand outside on the marked circles to ensure social distancing. Only a few customers have come to the shop,” said Harjeet Singh, another shopkeeper in Alambagh.

21-05-2020||City||Ganesh festival to be a simple, low-key affair||PUNE The Ganeshostav which is a ten-day festival and is celebrated with fervour will be a low-key affair this year due to the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.In a video conference meeting held on Wednesday, five Maanache (most revered) Ganapati mandal members met along with the three prominent mandals to decide upon the way forward for this year’s Ganeshostav. During the meeting, all mandals unanimously decided to celebrate the festival starting in August in a traditional and simple manner instead of going with major sets and designs.This meeting was attended by Shrikant Shete, president, Kasba Ganpati Saravajanik Ganesh Ustav Mandal, Kasba peth and member Saurabh Dhokte; Rajabhau Tikar, president, Tambadi Jogeshwari Mandal, along with members Prasad Kulkarni, Saurabh Dhadphale, Keshav Neurgaonkar and Aniruddha Gadgil. Pravinsheth Pardeshi, president, Guruji Talim Mandal, along with member Prithviraj Pardeshi. Vivek Khatavkar, president, Tulshibag mandal; Sanjeev Javale, president, Bhausaheb Rangari Ganapati mandal and Dagadu Sheth Halwai Ganapati Trust was represented by Sunil Rasne and Mahesh Suryawanshi, treasurer.“This year’s Ganeshotsav will be celebrated by setting up a traditional pavilion and though this was a primary meeting, we have decided that only common minimum programmes will be held with simple, spiritual ceremonies this Ganeshostav while all kind of social and public programmes will stand cancelled,” said Shrikant Shete, president Kasba Ganpati Saravajanik Ganesh Ustav mandal, Kasba peth.“We also plan to keep the Ganesha’s procession flexible keeping in view the current situation and how the situation clears post lockdown. Usually, the idea behind Ganeshostav is to bring people together but this year, we feel that people should participate emotionally instead of being present physically,” he said.“This year we will strictly adhere to all the rules and conditions laid by the administration and government during the Ganeshostav,” Shete added.During the meeting, the mandals have also appealed to people to maintain the sanctity of the Ganesh idol intact and requested idol makers not to make idols wearing masks or showing mask in any of their displays. They also appealed to the people bringing Ganapati idol home to avoid putting a mask on the idol as part of their decoration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ganesh-festival-to-be-a-simple-low-key-affair/story-KJYPA2o4w6ZuMN8N4mUxYO.html
21-05-2020||City||Bus with digital x-ray, blood test, swab collection facilities deployed in containment zones||PUNE To increase testing for Sars-cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has deployed a bus equipped with advanced digital x-ray, blood-test facility and a swab collection booth.The bus will move along the containment zones in Bhavani peth, Dhole Patil road wards and help take chest X-rays of high-risk contacts of positive patients.Dr Rajesh Dighe, zonal medical officer, said, “The bus is equipped with x-ray, blood test facility and even swab collection booth. The bus allows us to move it easily into various places and so we have decided to place it on alternate days near the swab collection centres at Tadiwala road in the Dhole Patil road ward, and Mahatma Phule Peth area in Bhavani peth ward.”The bus was inaugurated on Wednesday and out of the 75 suspected first contacts, 15 were scanned for X-ray on the first day at the Bhavani peth ward.The bus has been provided by Krsnaa Diagnostics which is headquartered in Pune and had earlier provided the same bus in Mumbai. Now two buses have been provided for each of the two civic bodies PMC and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC).“The x-ray facility scans the chest of the suspected high-risk patients who are mostly seniors citizens with comorbidities who may show symptoms of Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection or any pneumonia-like symptoms. If the tests are done in the initial stage we can start treatment early,” said Dr Dighe.Pallavi Jain, managing director, Krsnaa Diagnostics, said, “We have separated the bus into two compartments for the staff and the suspected patients. Each patient undergoes the x-ray scanning for which the results are displayed within 20 minutes and if we detect any patches of pneumonia or Covid-19 we inform the concerned health officer and then the suspected person can be sent for a swab test.”“Till the results are out the person can be asked for self home quarantine,” added Jain.As per the memorandum of understanding (MoU), the civic body will be charged Rs 400 for each scanning and blood test while the residents can avail this facility for free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bus-with-digital-x-ray-blood-test-swab-collection-facilities-deployed-in-containment-zones/story-oo6E8aRym8a8TGcnQavieN.html

They told us that a WhatsApp message was doing the rounds that a special train will start to take them to Uttarakhand. I alerted the state administration and Kiran Survase, Tehsildar, Vasai, reached the spot and convinced the group that no such train was arranged by the government,” said Jaiprakash Sabhapati, member, Uttarakhand Welfare Association. As the migrants had no money to return to their areas, trustees of a nearby under-construction temple were requested to let them stay at the premises. “The Dashmesh Gurudwara in Vasai also agreed to provide meals and water to the migrants twice a day,” added Sabhapati.Sabhapati said they are planning to complain to the state cyber cell to probe the source of the rumours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/over-60-migrants-gather-at-vasai-due-to-rumours-of-special-train-to-uttarakhand/story-k4jNbDiXpaQHB4jx98PMCN.html
21-05-2020||Kolkata||‘Cyclone or Earthquake’: Amphan’s intensity left Kolkata asking as buildings shook||When Super cyclone Amphan was tearing its way through Kolkata with wind speed gusting up to 130 km per hour, none could recollect any calamity to compare Wednesday’s devastation with. The city had never seen such destruction in its recent memories.“After every calamity, we tend to compare it with something in the past. We have seen cyclone Aila in 2009 and cyclone Bulbul in 2019. But Amphan was like hell. I have not seen anything of this sort in my life. It was as if the storm was whistling and bulldozing its way through,” said Bibhutibhusan Dey, 70, a resident of east Kolkata.Many people said they got an earthquake-like feeling when the cyclone was battering the city. Some said they felt that buildings were swaying. The feeling was all the more intense in high rises in east Kolkata which was closer to Cyclone Amphan’s path. “We felt as if the entire building was swaying. Initially, we thought that an earthquake was taking place even as the cyclone was raging outside. But then, we found out that it was because of the storm. It was really scary,” said Arpita Pal, who resides on the 10th floor of a high-rise building in east Kolkata.Tollywood actor Ankush Hazra also shared his feelings on social media and shared glimpses of his damaged apartment. He wrote: “Earthquake or Cyclone?”On Thursday morning, the streets and lanes bore the scar marks left behind by the storm - uprooted lamp posts and traffic signals, broken pieces of glasses from shattered windowpanes and damaged vehicles trapped under broken tree-branches among others. Several houses were also damaged when uprooted trees fell on them. “We are getting dozens of calls every second at the control room. Hundreds of trees, lamp posts and traffic signals have been uprooted. Several roads have been blocked. Power lines, cable wires and telephone wires have snapped. The city is in a mess,” said an official of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s control room.As the storm passed away, the netizens started uploading horrific pictures and videos on social networking sites – exploding transformers, trees getting uprooted, tin roofs and street-hoardings flying like paper sheets and a raging storm that Kolkatans had never seen.“I saw at least two transformers exploding. It was like fireworks during Diwali night. Suddenly the entire area plunged into darkness and since then we have no power. No electronic gadgets are working, I could only charge one mobile with a power bank,” said Arindam Biswas, a resident of Baghajatin area in south Kolkata. With roads blocked by fallen trees, hardly any traffic was seen and shops and markets, too, remained closed on Thursday in the aftermath of the storm. The city had virtually come to standstill.“It was a real lockdown and everyone maintained social distancing. No going out, No mobile phones either,” said Arindam Sen, a resident of Madurdaha in east Kolkata.In the slums, the situation was all the worse. While thousands of shanties were badly damaged as their roofs and walls gave way in the face of the storm and the intense rain, the people either took shelters in nearby schools or in some permanent houses.“We never thought that the storm would be so intense. The civic officials told us to move to the nearby school building. But since we had seen Aila and Bulbul, we thought Amphan would be the same or with a little more intensity. But when it hit, we had nowhere to go. The school was too far. We decided to take shelter in a nearby two-storied house,” said Sheetal, who works as a maid and lives in a shanty near Anandapur in east Kolkata.Several parts of Kolkata, including the NSCBI airport, remained flooded with rainwater. The local municipal corporation is yet to come out with the assessment of the damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/cyclone-or-earthquake-amphan-s-intensity-left-kolkata-asking-as-buildings-shook/story-biTXgFWtwDPiqeOmLVSDYO.html

The district has not reported a single case of Covid-19 since May 10, and on Thursday (May 21), it is left with no active case as two patients who were admitted at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, recovered and were discharged.In the past two months, the district witnessed 105 Covid-19 cases, out of which 102 defeated the virus while three succumbed.Mohali once topped among all districts of Punjab in the number of cases and was considered a hotspot. Of the 105 confirmed cases, 46 were from Jawaharpur village in Dera Bassi, while eight were from Nayagaon and other were scattered across the entire district. Among those who have died are a 65-year-old Nayagaon man (March 31), 74-year-old Kharar woman (April 6) and a 74-year-old Zirakpur man Zirakpur (May 7).In the past 10 days, the health department has been taking around 100 samples every day, but all have tested negative so far.Dr Harmandeep Kaur Brar, district’s nodal officer for Covid-19, says: “We have to wait for 28 days after the last positive case to declare the district virus-free,” she said.Adding a note of caution, civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said: “Although there is no case in the district, people should not assume the deadly disease has been fully contained and eradicated. The threat of coronavirus is still there, even as the curfew has been lifted. If we adopt a careless attitude and do not take precautions, the disease can strike back in no time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-s-mohali-district-tames-covid-19-for-now/story-zWjv7KVizau7vUk0PGB4sM.html
21-05-2020||Mumbai||Study reveals marked decline in noise levels in Indian Ocean Region during lockdown||A slump in shipping traffic during the lockdown has resulted in a marked decline in noise levels across the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) – which includes Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean – a study by Pune’s Maritime Research Centre (MRC) has revealed.The average noise levels in IOR fell from 103.6 decibels (dB) during March to 73.4 dB in May, revealed the study conducted by MRC along with the Foundation for Underwater Domain Awareness, a non-governmental organisation working on marine ecosystem concerns due to acoustic habitat degradation. For a comparison, 103 dB is as loud as a jet flying at 1,000 feet, while 73.4 dB is the sound of a vacuum cleaner. However, measurements in air and water use separate references for dB calculations (1 micro pascal in water and 20 micro pascal in air).Comparative heat maps of shipping traffic during March and May indicated a sharp decline in ocean noise, especially across the east coast and southwestern coastline.“A surge in the shipping traffic witnessed over the past three decades has suddenly plummeted to a level where background ocean noise can be measured. It calls for a major policy rethink on how we can redistribute the traffic to control noise. Using this data, solutions can be put in place to navigate development through a sustainable growth model,” said Arnab Das, author of the study, former commander in the Indian Navy and director, MRC.The reduction in the noise will benefit the marine ecosystem, leading to habitat improvement, the study concluded.“The low frequency ambient noise due to shipping has been documented to have doubled (3 dB) every decade since 1950 forcing the marine ecosystem to bear the brunt of unsustainable development,” said Das.Noise levels more than 120 dB cause discomfort to marine mammals, above 170 dB causes injury (internal injuries, bleeding and haemorrhages) and beyond 200 dB can lead to instant death.“Low frequency ambient noise overlaps with the hearing of marine mammals, particularly big whales. They use sound [sonar] for multiple biologically critical functions like navigation, communication, foraging, finding mates, for breeding and avoiding predators. Increasing ocean noise masks these characteristic abilities. While the lockdown may have its negative impacts, noise reduction comes as a silver lining for relaxed marine environment even if it is for a brief period,” said Das.However, peak noise levels of 94.5 dB had been recorded along the Gujarat and Maharashtra coasts even during the lockdown. The peak was more than 120 dB prior to the lockdown for the entire IOR. A percentage comparison cannot be done in case of dB levels, as it is a logarithmic conversion of the linear scale, and will give a false sense of high or low.“Higher noise towards the Gujarat and Maharashtra areas may be due to cargo movement, which is marginally higher in this region than the rest of the IOR. Oil exploration is also going on as an essential activity,” said Amitabh Kumar, director general (shipping).According to Kumar, the findings of the study were accurate as international trade plummeted considerably during the lockdown months.“We must realise that this traffic constitutes shipping activities in high seas. These are not the ships coming to India, but are the ones using the important IOR route with cargo emanating from the Gulf to be supplied to Asian, Southeast Asia and Eurasian countries. With the reduction in the international trade due to lockdown across countries in these regions, ocean noise is bound to fall. At the same time, many of the ships are being used as storage points for petroleum cargo that use this route, and are currently stationary closer to ports,” said Kumar.However, he also added that the lockdown period was not the apt time to ascertain the safe limits for ocean noise.“The reduction required in activities should be adjudged after the lockdown when international trade is fully functional again. The current drop in noise level is consequential to the slowdown in traffic, which will be nowhere near the levels when operations resume,” Kumar said.MRC’s study used an assessment tool to evaluate real-time low frequency ambient noise variation in the IOR during both time periods using an automated identification system (AIS) which provides the geo-location of ships and catches individual frequency levels through calibrated noise monitors to record the average and peak noises.According to the Indian National Shipowners’ Association, between 2017 and 2019, the estimated capacity of shipping traffic increased from 27,500 metric tonnes (mt) to 35,383 mt, which included navy ships, security vessels, export-import goods, dry cargo, petroleum products, gas load and crude oil.In December 2019, global regulatory body International Maritime Organisation (IMO) had decided to implement noise abatement measures for safe standards at sea, but the decision was opposed by major Southeast Asian countries such as China.An independent expert, who was not part of the study, said that such noise measurement studies were futile if IMO does not declare safe standards.“Only when there is regulation and penalty, can there be restriction in shipping operations to conserve the marine ecosystem. To avoid a surge in marine mammal deaths, shipping operations and international trade needs to be opened up gradually and country specific caps should be in place for movement of vessels within their region,” said E Vivekanandan, marine biologist and emeritus scientist at Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/study-reveals-decline-in-noise-levels-in-indian-ocean-region-during-lockdown/story-KZyDAXX19LuGM9FXjXYQ3H.html

21-05-2020||Chandigarh||Soothsayer vs doomsayer: Astrologers back in demand as anxiety mounts in pandemic times||In the backdrop of many commenting on the worldwide failure at predicting astrologically the onset of Covid-19, P Khurrana, a seasoned astrologer and father of actor Ayushmann Khurrana, says: “I say with pride that I did not make any prediction about the pandemic because my calling is to be a soothsayer and not a doomsayer”.Khurrana, who returned to foretelling what the stars say on May 18, adds: “I can now say that come September and the people will see some relief from the pandemic and life will start returning to normal.”ONLINE COURSESChandigarh-based tarot card reader and astrologer Poonam Sharma says: “I did predict that 2020 would be a difficult one but the prediction of pandemics, natural calamities and public health fall in a line of astrology called mundane science. It’s different from individual astrology done through birth charts that is usually practised by astrologers.Poonam, who is the president of Jyotish Prangan, an organisation of occult sciences, however, dismisses that silence on the pandemic may have shaken the faith of believers. She says, “In fact, more people are now reaching out to know what the future holds for them individually in the changed circumstances. In times of anxiety, people turn to either psychologists or astrologers and I practise in both areas”. She adds that she has been holding online courses in tarot card reading, vastu and aura cleansing and the number of students in all three classes has grown in the lockdown.NAMASTE INDIACity astrologer Madan Gupta Spatu, who belongs to the nearby Spatu town in Himachal Pradesh, says: “The prediction of the pandemic is a thing of the past but now what is being asked of astrologers is when will the pandemic go. To this I will say scientists, doctors or political leaders can’t forecast the exact timing of departure of Covid-19. But where science stops, astrology starts so the countdown will begin in September but the adieu will happen only in November.”Spatu adds that he had predicted that it would be an unusual year and now he predicts that India will lead the world in this decade. “The world is looking up to India for medicine for coronavirus besides practising our age-old rituals such as namaste and washing hands,” he says.FAITH NOT LOSTAstrologers were indeed caught on the wrong foot and the city’s jovial astrologer Bharati, who practises from Sector 49, says: “People do ask why astrologers couldn’t predict such a big calamity. One explains to them the scope of the science. However, the faith of people is not shaken. As long as there is anxiety, want and unhappiness, people will continue to visit astrologers for their share of hope!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/soothsayer-vs-doomsayer-astrologers-back-in-demand-as-anxiety-mounts-in-pandemic-times/story-YS5bCqMccvjNnTGubhoyJI.html

21-05-2020||Mumbai||HC discharges PWD engineer booked in irrigation scam related case||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday discharged the then executive engineer of the public works department (PWD) from a case related to the state irrigation scam.Anilkumar Gaikwad, the then executive engineer of presidency division of PWD, was booked by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) in September 2015, along with partners of FA Enterprises - Fateh Mohammed Khatri and his sons Nisar, Jaitun, Aabid and Jahid.According to ACB, the Konkan Irrigation Development Corporation does not allot any contract to a contractor who has already been awarded three dam construction contracts. FA Contractors had six works allotted to it and in order to have more irrigation contracts, formed a new firm--FA Enterprises-- and claimed that it was made by directors who resigned from FA Contractors.Gaikwad is accused of overlooking the rules and forwarding a proposal for registration of FA Enterprises as Class-1A contractor with the government. It was alleged that he forwarded the proposal without proper scrutiny of documents submitted by the contractor.He had moved HC after the special ACB court rejected his discharge plea on March 15, 2019.Justice AM Badar overruled the special court’s order due to lack of evidence against Gaikwad. The judge also took into consideration a government resolution (GR) issued by the PWD on November 28, 2018, that exempted all its employees from penal consequences arising out of the scrutiny of documents submitted by contractors.The judge said that according to the GR, PWD employees or officials who may be entrusted with the work of checking documents submitted by contractors shall not be held responsible for penal consequences in respect of scrutiny of such documents if those turn out to be false and fabricated.“As this GR has retrospective effect, continuation of prosecution against the applicant (Gaikwad) which is essentially with an allegation that he has not ascertained veracity and truthfulness of the documents submitted by the FA Enterprises, would certainly amount to abuse of the process of court,” said justice Badar.The judge also noted that there was hardly any evidence against the PWD engineer. “Perusal of the entire chargesheet does not reveal iota of evidence for even prima facie demonstration of an offence of criminal misconduct on the part of the applicant,” said justice Badar, exonerating Gaikwad.The HC also noted that the entire file relating to registration and certification of FA Enterprises as Class-1A government contractor had gone missing and no original document was available to shed light on the entire episode of registration of FA Enterprises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-discharges-pwd-engineer-booked-in-irrigation-scam-related-case/story-Q6Rv2D7l9CRiZnAZKKYIHK.html

21-05-2020||Delhi||E-funerals become the new normal during lockdown||Be it any religion, the rituals of saying final goodbyes to the dead run deep in every faith. But the pandemic has robbed families of this tradition, as priests and closed ones have started relying on technology for funerals. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has also ruled out that in case of funerals, congregation of more than twenty people will not be permitted.Recently, it was reported that fashion designer Riddhima Kapoor Sahni also attended the last rites of her father actor Rishi Kapoor virtually through a video call. And actor Sanjay Suri took to twitter about how he attended his wife’s grandmother’s funeral through a zoom call. Indeed, lockdown has changed the way the country mourns its dead.Cyril Benedict, a bank manager in Delhi, had to watch his 88-year-old uncle’s funeral online recently as he was unable to go to his native city Patna due to travel restrictions. He says, “Unable to see or touch a loved one in their final hours or grieve together with family is hard. However, the tech workaround made a good option and I could at least pay my last respects through a WhatsApp video call.” He adds, “After lockdown, we will hold a memorial and celebrate my uncle’s life who died of a terminal disease. It’s not cremations but hearts that connects families.”Similarly, 80-year-old Mahadev Ekka of Ranchi who died due to old age ailments had a quiet funeral with only six family members. His elder son Jahaan Ekka, who works in Delhi, couldn’t reach his village and thus had to watch the funeral pyre on his laptop screen. Jahaan says, “Showing compassion from the far end of a laptop or mobile is strange but it made me feel closer to my family. If I had been there, I would have probably not been as sane as I am now. We understand the gravity of the situation and would be there for each other, at least virtually.”Read: Vienna funerals go online amid coronavirus fearsEven before lockdown, when extended families couldn’t join the last rites, neighbours poured in to offer their condolences. However, all they can do now is a phone call. “Ours is a very close-knit colony and we celebrate each loss and happiness together – be it birth or death. But after lockdown, when a neighbour of ours passed away, we decided it wasn’t safe to visit the family so resorted to offer virtual condolences. We would make up for it once things improve,” says Shahid Md, a resident of Geeta Colony, Delhi.All such rituals, mass or prayers have to wait till after the lockdown, say those that perform such services.Pandit Jitender Sharma, a Hindu priest says, “My whole generation has been conducting last rites and never have we seen such a time where people had to attend last rites virtually. We have seen people break down and hug each other at cremation grounds, it’s what brings comfort. But they can’t do that now. Bahut bura lagta hai dekh kar ki aise samay mein log akele rote hai.” A few days ago, Fr. Satya, a Roman Catholic priest performed the anointing rites of an elderly woman as she lay on her final hours in her home in Delhi. Her son used video call to patch in the priest who put on his cloak and did the virtual anointing and prayer. “The Vatican has also waived the requirement of in person prayer and said prayers delivered over video calls would have the same spiritual effect. It’s the best we can do at the moment. We haven’t lost the religiosity per say but just adopted a practical way to keep people safe.” Follow @htcity for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/e-funerals-become-the-new-normal-during-lockdown/story-9daynk5yTU32xxSM9PWTqJ.html

21-05-2020||Lucknow||UP govt imprisoning those that are helping migrants: Priyanka Gandhi||A day after the standoff between the BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government and the Congress over the latter’s offer to provide 1,000 buses for migrants, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra claimed those trying to help stranded labourers are being jailed and asked party workers to carry on with the fight.Uttar Pradesh Congress chief was arrested twice on Wednesday -- first in Agra for sitting on a dharna to protest against UP government not granting permission to allow buses arranged for migrants by the Congress enter the state. He was granted bail by an Agra court and released, before being rearrested by a team of Lucknow police in a second case filed here in connection with the Congress’ standoff with the state government.“Have you seen the the method of Yogi (Adityanath) government to fight the coronavirus epidemic? When the Congress arranged buses for migrant labourers, the Yogi government sent Uttar Pradesh Congress president to jail in a false case,” Priyanka Gandhi, the general secretary of the party, said in a message.The party’s Uttar Pradesh unit’s media convenor said Lallan Kumar said she asked the party workers not to be afraid and carry on the fight for the migrant workers. Gandhi said, “The entire nation is standing united to fight the epidemic but the UP government is putting those making arrangements of bus, train tickets, food and ration for the labourers in jail.” Referring to the 30th death anniversary of her father, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, she has said, “Rajiv ji gave his life for the country. He loved Hindustan and its people. He could not see their pain. We have learnt from him to help the weak.” Lalan said that Priyanka Gandhi has called upon about 50,000 Congress workers of the state to raise their voices for the labourers through ‘Facebook live’ on Thursday against the “oppression”, as that would be the “proper tribute for Rajiv Gandhi”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-imprisoning-those-that-are-helping-migrants-priyanka-gandhi/story-osEASBM35pRJeLHcmUVzQM.html

21-05-2020||Chandigarh||J&K edu secy believes govt teachers shoudn’t send their kids to pvt schools, courts controversy||Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) education secretary Asgar Hassan Samoon courted controversy when he criticised government teachers for enrolling their children in private schools.Samoon, who hails from Kashmir’s remote Gurez Valley, has made it his mission to bring government schools in par with private schools and in his opinion one way to do it is to have the teachers’ children themselves study at the schools.His attempts have been dismissed by his detractors as ways to garner headlines. This will hardly make any impact. The education secretary is only trying to grab news headlines,’’ said Ahmad Bashir, a former government teacher.CONTROVERSIAL TWEETSTaking a jibe at teachers, Samoon had tweeted, “I often wonder why government school teachers in JKUT enrol their own children in the very private schools whose contribution to quality education they don’t wish to acknowledge. A strange paradox indeed. It speaks volumes about quality education that we all aspire for in government schools.”Announcing the suspension of Anantnag chief education officer, Samoon had tweeted, “Shocked to know that middle school in Monghal, Anantnag, has 15 teachers and 13 students. Those who don’t teach don’t deserve mercy. Directors should explain why teacher deployments were not rationalised despite HLG directions. Anantnag CEO has been placed under suspension. Follow rules or face action.”‘SAMOON IS VYING FOR REAL CHANGE’ However, not everyone is critical of Samoon, some officials, who had previously served at the department said Samoon was simply trying to revamp the education system.However, many held that he will ultimately not been able to make any impact like former IAS officer Shah Faesal, who as Kashmir education director had tried to bring change in government schools.Faisal was removed from the department after coming under criticism from various teachers’ bodies.J&K Teachers’ Forum general secretary Rafiq Ahmad Rather said, “Teachers with influential backgrounds or relatives of bureaucrats are not transferred out of cities.”Rather said enrolling children in government schools should not only be made mandatory for teachers but also for bureaucrats. “Only then will these schools see improvement,” he added.Some people also believe that Samoon has a soft corner towards people running private schools in Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/j-k-edu-secy-believes-govt-teachers-shoudn-t-send-their-kids-to-pvt-schools-courts-controversy/story-YCpw5Jo2rjUPpW2pBEvSXM.html

21-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab asks teachers to check smuggling of Teacher’s, withdraws orders hours later||Desperate times call for desperate measures. The Punjab government, which has been rattled by recurring incidents of liquor smuggling and losses in excise collection, deputed school teachers at distilleries to keep a check on the supply. Hours later, it withdrew the orders after media reports sparked an outrage.It all began when the Gurdaspur district administration on Wednesday asked 24 teachers to keep an eye on smuggling of popular brands such as Rass Bhari, Rano Sofi, Asli Mota Santra and Punjab King.The Gurdaspur deputy commissioner’s office posted the teachers outside four distilleries owned by prominent liquor barons.The orders were issued by the assistant commissioner (general) Raman Kochar, on behalf of deputy commissioner Mohammad Ishfaq. But the district administration revoked its decision on Thursday afternoon after facing flak for the decision. Kochar, in his order on behalf of the DC, said, “Teachers’ duties at liquor factories have been cancelled with immediate effect.”With schools closed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, teachers are already stretched thin with conducting online classes, distributing mid-day meals, books, facilitating online admissions, screening migrant labourers at bus stops and railway stations and checking at inter-state borders.WAS SAFEGUARDING REVENUE: DCThe earlier order said that in view of the Covid-19 crisis, teachers have been deployed at liquor factories as executive magistrates and will submit their report to the Batala tehsildar daily.“In case of negligence, a first information report (FIR) under Section 188 (disobeying a public servant’s order) of the Indian Penal Code will be registered against them,” the order had said.Backing the earlier decision, Ishfaq said, “There’s nothing wrong in using the services of teachers. We deployed teachers at liquor factories to utilise manpower. The state government has declared each government employee an executive magistrate.”“The decision was taken to curb liquor smuggling. We are only trying to safeguard the government’s revenue,” said Ishfaq, a lateral entry Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer who was formerly an engineer in public health and has no experience in civil administration.ORDER RAISES EYEBROWSMeanwhile, the deputy commissioner of another district in Punjab, requesting anonymity, said, “There is no way I would allow this in my district. It is not for teachers to keep an eye on the supply of alcohol.”Democratic Teachers’ Front (DTF) president Davinder Singh Punia said, “This is against the dignity of teachers. We demanded the immediate revocation of this order and strict action against officials who assigned these duties. Has the Punjab government fallen on such hard times that they are using teachers to check liquor smuggling?”When contacted, state education minister Vijay Inder Singla said, “The deputy commissioner has taken this decision at his own level. I have told the secretary to speak to him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/now-punjab-teachers-to-check-smuggling-of-teacher-s/story-eLSz59xvoUTizmFTnUa7eO.html

21-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi hospital issues notice to quarantined staff for vacating hotel, dharamshala rooms||Delhi’s Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (LNJP) Hospital has issued a notice to all its quarantined staff to vacate the hotel or dharamshala rooms arranged by the hospital authorities by 12 pm on Thursday.The order cites the guidelines of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.The order issued by LNJP’s medical director Suresh Kumar states that the hospital will not spend money after May 21 and the guest will have to bear the expenses himself or herself.The Delhi government had earlier decided that the doctor, nurses or paramedical staff engaged in the treatment of coronavirus patients will work continuously for 14 days, after which they will get 14 days rest.A 14-day rest meant that they should be quarantined so that even if there is any kind of infection, their family will not be harmed. It was also decided that the LNJP Hospital would make arrangements for all such people to stay in the hotels or dharamshala or any other place. The hospital was to bear all the expenses.But now, citing the guidelines of the Union Health Ministry, the hospital order stated that the medical staff should vacate the hotel or dharamshala rooms.However opposing this move, the Resident Doctors Association has written a letter to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan stating, “The coronavirus can show its effect by two to 14 days. Non-symptomatic healthcare workers have been found to be coronavirus positive in many cases even after wearing PPE kits.”“After duty, the staff should be quarantined and they should be tested for Covid-19 even if they do not show any symptom or wear PPE kits... It is important. Removing this system will increase the risk of the virus spreading to doctors, their families, patients and the community. Therefore, amend the recently released guidelines and give relief to the corona warriors of the country,” the letter further read. According to the Centre’s new guidelines for the healthcare workers issued on May 15, “only healthcare workers with high-risk contacts will be in quarantine who have handled coronavirus patients without proper PPE or who have symptoms”.Based on the guidelines of the central government, Delhi Health Secretary Padmini Singla also issued orders. After the order of Health Secretary, the Medical Director of LNJP Hospital has also issued orders in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hospital-issues-notice-to-quarantined-staff-for-vacating-hotel-dharamshala-rooms/story-oabm3Q12gzDzqfzw0IFAyI.html

21-05-2020||Chandigarh||Srinagar gunfight: As 21 families go homeless, Kashmiris call for donations to rebuild their houses||As 21 families went homeless after their houses were destroyed during a gunfight in downtown Srinagar on Tuesday, Kashmiris have appealed for helping the affected people.While the administration is yet to announce relief to the families, the social media community, comprising locals and several non-resident Kashmiris, has already started online campaigns to raise donations for the reconstruction of their houses at the earliest.The local mosque at Kanimazar Nawa Kadal, where the gunfight took place, has also taken the responsibility of relief and reconstruction to mitigate the sufferings of these families.Abdul Raheem Dar, president of Intizamia Committee Majid Hanfia Kanimazar, said the losses have been pegged at around ₹12-15 crores, including the household belongings.“It’s a chunk of land where 19 houses have either been completely damaged or become unliveable. Some 21 families that resided here are now homeless,” Dar said adding, “Not only the houses but all their valuables have been destroyed. Gold ornaments got melted due to the fire.”The houses were damaged in the blaze that erupted after several blasts and exchange of fire between militants and security forces during a 12-hour encounter in Nawa Kadal area of Srinagar on Tuesday. Two militants were killed while three CRPF personnel and a policeman were injured during the encounter.Srinagar deputy commissioner Shahid Choudhary said a team of district administration visited the place to assess the damages. “We will be reaching out to the affected people after getting the assessment report,” he said.Dar said they have started collecting donations from people for the affected families, most of which are poor, to either reconstruct the houses or handover money to the families so that they could rebuild their homes. The account details have been shared on the social media.Dar, however, claimed they were facing police harassment for installing a donation kiosk near the mosque. “Though we take proper precautions, people come from different places to take a stock of the damage. We have been maintaining social distancing and using masks and sanitisers,” he said.On social media, people have been vigorously calling for help to the homeless persons. “My dear Kashmiri brethren, this is a humble appeal. We’re all deeply impacted by #Nawakadal & alhumdullilah have come together to rebuild homes for our people. A corpus of ₹10 lakh has already been committed by an anonymous Kashmiri,” wrote Shazia Bakshi, a netizen.“Residents of Kanimazar are leading the initiative to assist 15 families whose houses were destroyed in the encounter. Friends, please generously donate,” wrote Khuram Parvez, a prominent human rights activist.However, BJP state spokesperson Altaf Thakur was against any relief to the affected. He said harbouring terrorists is tantamount to offence and the families deserve no sympathy. “During the gunfight, terrorists moved from one house to another as they had strategically selected a place where they could hide and escape from. They have been involved in an offence and don’t deserve any compensation,” he held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/srinagar-gunfight-as-21-families-go-homeless-kashmiris-call-for-donations-to-rebuild-their-houses/story-SB6xOqQx1SFjYGWYyF2xPI.html

The faculty of Ayurveda’s 16-member committee prepared the protocol in the second week of May this year. The protocol has been revised further after seeking suggestions from the experts. Prof Tripathi said, “Although the Ayurvedic protocol for the management of Covid-19 patients is complete in itself, it is open for periodical revision on the basis of suggestions from Ayurveda experts. It was first released on the faculty of Ayurveda’s website for consideration of all faculty members on May 14. A copy of it had been sent to the secretary Ayush Ministry.” Prof Tripathi said that Ayurvedic protocol includes all three procedures- Daivyavipashraya (spiritual healing), Yukti Vipashraya (Ayurvedic medication), Satwavajaya (psychological counseling)- as described in Ayurveda for the management of Covid-19 affected persons in quarantine and post quarantine.Prof Tripathi said, “Spiritual healing is an important part of Ayurvedic way treatment.

The evaluation started on Tuesday.The teachers did not report for evaluation duty following boycott call given by one of the teachers’ associations citing risk of contracting Covid-19.According to the secondary education department, of 1,100 teachers who were deployed for evaluation of answer sheets in five centres in Bareilly district, only 568 reported for duty.“Since so many teachers from different parts of the district will gather at the evaluation centre, there will be a higher risk of contracting Covid-19. Bareilly is in the red zone and the evaluation of copies poses a risk to teachers and their family members,” said Naresh Singh, district president of one of the teachers’ associations.DIOS Amar Kant Singh has warned that those who do not report for duty would be taken to task. He brushed aside the apprehensions raised by Singh about the pandemic.“We have maintained social distancing at all five centres. We have reduced the total number of evaluators from 1,400 to 1,100 to ensure that a distance of at least two-metres is maintained between two evaluators in a classroom. Besides, all the centres were properly sanitized.

The corporation did submit the five-year business plan before the lockdown, but has given neither the ARR for the year 2020-21, nor the annual performance review for the year 2019-20, nor any tariff revision proposal.“Last week, we again sent a reminder to UPPCL, asking them to file ARR in view of the parameters changed by the Covid-19 lockdown but we have not received the ARR proposal,” said a senior UPERC official.“We cannot wait anymore and if they do not submit the ARR proposal/ tariff revision proposal, the commission will be compelled to suo motu pronounce its tariff order with zero tariff increase,” he added. Sources said the commission was not ready to consider the revenue requirement and power purchase figures projected by UPPCL in its business plan, saying that a significant electricity load crash due to the coronavirus lockdown had changed all the parameters. Hence, the regulator is insisting that UPPCL rework the figures and send the ARR accordingly.“We cannot allow UPPCL any new power purchase agreement, considering the fact that the electricity demand in UP had reduced by 4,000-5,000 after the lockdown on March 25 and this has changed the UPPCL’s old power purchase and revenue requirement projections for 2020-21,” said UPERC official sources.“This is why we have asked UPPPCL to summit a realistic ARR,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/regulator-may-announce-zero-tariff-hike-sans-uppcl-proposal/story-yEXv5f5YIqHDGG6lyYZp5K.html
21-05-2020||Mumbai||‘Routine sortie’: Navy on low-flying chopper over flamingo habitat in Mumbai||On Wednesday morning, Navi Mumbai residents were surprised to see a helicopter fly very low, close to the flamingo feeding grounds in Talawe wetlands, scattering the birds.The Indian Navy said this was part of their routine migratory bird survey as flamingos and waders were a flight safety hazard. The survey was carried out to ascertain density of migratory birds as this habitat falls within the designated ‘local flying area’ (LFA) of the Indian Navy Station (INS) Shikra in Colaba, officials said.Over 1.5 lakh flamingos have flocked to wetlands in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region this year, the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) said last month, estimating a 25 per cent increase in numbers than 2019. The BNHS said that lower human activity during lockdown created ideal foraging conditions in Navi Mumbai wetlands.Local resident Sandeep Bangia, who photographed the helicopter around 10 am on Wednesday, said that he have never seen a helicopter over the flamingo habitat earlier. “I live on the 17th floor, and what seemed like a defence helicopter, was flying as low as the 14th floor,” said Bangia. “The whirring noise (from the helicopter) disturbed the birds as the chopper made multiple rounds over the patch within 10 minutes.”The navy said that based on videos taken at the site, flamingo numbers were much more than previous years.“INS Shikra’s flight safety officer, skilled in bird migratory studies in LFA, was present for the sortie. For any defence station, it is essential to know the presence of migratory birds for flight safety. Large migratory bird congregation at this zone shows a risk in helicopter movement, and needs to be avoided. This is a safety requirement and there is no mischief,” said Commander Mehul Karnik, Indian Navy spokesperson. “Such surveys are usually conducted using unmanned aerial vehicles in large military airfields but in this region Chetak helicopters have to be deployed.”A BNHS official, requesting anonymity, said, “A similar sortie was observed during our study in Panje in 2017 but not at the NRI complex flamingo habitat over the past few years.”Sunil Agarwal, another resident said constant attention being given to this habitat makes a clear case for declaring the site a protected area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/routine-sortie-navy-on-low-flying-chopper-over-flamingo-habitat-in-mumbai/story-keE2eirmWZ5jXGJ2uA21cO.html

Disclosing this, general secretary of the association Bobby Jindal said, “The PMO has responded to their complaint and it has been forwarded to additional chief secretary, industries and commerce, Punjab Vini Mahajan for inquiry.”He said the association had demanded the intervention of the office in the matter and steps for bringing some relief to fabric mill owners.Seeking waiver of interest on delayed payments for the lockdown period, the association said, “Even after the lockdown, the members will not be able to pay 18% interest and the rate of interest should be equal to that of charged by banks.”Members of the association held a meeting in the last week and decided not to pay interest on delayed payments to fibre mill owners in Punjab and other states including Surat, Mumbai, etc for the lockdown period. Jindal said, “There are around 500 fabric mills in the district, situated on the Tajpur Road, Bahadurke Road, Jalandhar Bypass, focal points and other areas. The industry is reeling under losses and, if fibre mill owners continue to impose 18% interest on delayed payments, the fabric mill owners will be in dire financial straits.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/forced-to-pay-18-interest-on-delayed-payments-punjab-fabric-association-files-complaint-with-pmo/story-6DXTbK0umXu7HOX5AqNRrM.html
21-05-2020||City||Resumption of bus service comes as big relief to people stranded in Ludhiana||The resumption of bus service in the state on Wednesday after around two months came as a big relief for the people stranded in different locations due to curfew. Around 35 buses, both of PRTC and Punjab Roadways, ferried passengers to various destinations, including Jalandhar, Amritsar, Moga, Hoshiarpur, Patiala, Sangrur, Ferozepur, from the Inter-State Bus Terminal (ISBT) here on Wednesday.Each bus carried 20 to 25 passengers against its sitting capacity of 50. The passengers were ferried from one bus stand to another with no halts at bus stops on the way. As there was no rush of passengers on the first day, buses had to wait for several hours for an adequate number of passengers of the end destination.The first bus to Chandigarh from Ludhiana left at pm after 23 people boarded the bus for Chandigarh.“I have to go to Jalandhar, but a conductor informed me that the last bus left 10 minutes ago. Now, I will have to wait for an hour or more till more passengers for Jalandhar gather here,” said Lalit Kumar, a resident of Kathua of Jammu and Kashmir, whose wife Urmil is admitted in Deep Hospital here for appendicitis surgery. “I have to get some important documents concerning her treatment from Kathua, so I will take a bus from Jalandhar to Pathankot from where I will go with my cousin to Kathua after some days when the border opens,” he said. Similarly, Prem Singal, a vegetable vendor, who travelled from Hoshiarpur to Ludhiana, was waiting for a bus to Patiala. “My mother, who lives in Hoshiarpur, was not well, so I had gone to meet her in March while my wife and two kids were in Patiala, where I sell vegetables to make a living. They were left on their own throughout the curfew, while I was stuck in Hoshiapur. I also ran out of money during this time and left with the money just for travelling,” he added. PASSENGERS SCREENED BEFORE BOARDING BUSESAround 14 rural dispensary pharmacists were deputed at the bus stand for screening passengers before they boarded the buses.Karamjeet Kaur, a pharmacist, said the temperature of all the passengers is being checked and in case a person is found having high temperature, he will be taken to the hospital.“Till now, we have not encountered any passenger with fever. We are screening each and every person and giving him a sanitiser to clean his hands before boarding the bus,” she said. Similarly, around 10 Civil Defence staff members helped in maintaining social distancing at the bus stand. The volunteers ensured people stood in queues while boarding the buses and sit at a distance as per the marking on the seats.Inderjit Singh Chawla, general manager, Ludhiana depot, said around 500 people boarded the 35 buses for different cities on Wednesday. “Everything went on smoothly on the first day. The municipal corporation sanitised the bus stand on Tuesday evening while the civil surgeon’s office had deputed a medical team for carrying out screening. Similary, a Civil Defence team helped us in maintaining social distancing,” said Inderjit Singh Chawla. “We ensured that people do not face any inconvenience and buses reach safely at their destinations,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/resumption-of-bus-service-comes-as-big-relief-to-people-stranded-in-ludhiana/story-ShMDkGoVbmnTC1fHYvG0EP.html

In the Star Rating of Garbage Free Cities’ survey for 2019-20, Thane bagged three stars – one up from last year’s two.The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) cited improvement in garbage collection, increase in waste segregation and quick redressal of complaints for the improved ranking. The cities were judged on cleanliness of drains and water bodies and management of plastic waste and debris. Solid waste management was one of the main parameters to award points.A civic official, requesting anonymity, said, “Garbage is collected daily and segregated before being transported to the dumping ground. We have installed GPS on garbage collection vans for efficient work.”The city generates more than 960 metric tonnes of garbage daily. He added, “We have streamlined garbage collection and transport. The segregation in housing societies has increased from 50% to 80%. We have also placed litter bins, especially for plastic waste. The commercial areas are cleaned twice a day.”TMC claimed it has addressed 75% of the complaints it has received on the Swacchh Bharat application.Thane activists, however, said there is no improvement and that they can see garbage strewn at public places.Milind Patankar, an activist, said, “TMC has merely put extra burden on citizens to treat waste. Waste treatment needs to be centralised or decentralised and should be undertaken by TMC which has the resources. Waste segregation has increased but the segregated waste is dumped into one van and taken to the dumping ground. Only wet waste should be collected daily while dry waste should be collected once a week.”He added that a few months ago when his housing society called thermocol collection van, the TMC asked them to send the thermocol waste with the regular garbage van.Another activist Chandrahas Tawade said, “The ranking comes as a surprise as we can still see heaps of garbage in the city. There are many initiatives, but all on paper. We are yet to see a satisfactory result.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-improves-in-garbage-free-rating-activists-say-efforts-not-enough/story-SzBW7V8EA1O681pezdP5VL.html

It has formed a coalition with BJP to win over non-Sikh votes,” he said. He added that developments amid the Covid-19 pandemic will determine the future of Punjab politics and the Congress may have a better chance of electoral win in the future due to its regional strength as a result of the Congress High Command’s influence and proactive role played by Captain Amarinder Singh as the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-s-electoral-process-in-focus-during-webinar-at-panjab-university/story-ghkeUI8Ci9CHrYdl7gkzsL.html

In quarantine during the extended lockdown, these labourers were observing their religious practise, and were not really getting their morning meal, Sehri, which is supposed to be consumed quite early in the morning. Gagandeep says, “These people do get provided food from the arrangements made by the Delhi Government, but sehri is consumed in the morning and then fast is observed for the rest of the day. It was difficult for them to get food at the right time, to be able to continue fasting. So, to arrange some food in the morning, I approached my friend Irtiza Quraishi, who then connected us with Tarique Afaque.” The psychologist, who was visiting this transition centre for labourers, on the request of Delhi Police official Anant Kumar Gunjan — SHO at Amar Colony Police Station — adds, “Afaque, who lives in Okhla, has since then been going to Nizamuddin at one O’Clock in the morning, every day; to bring sehri for these labourers.” Afaque, who is part of a Delhi-based biker group, Royal Mavericks, credits his group for providing the necessary funds of this service. He adds, “I have been collecting the sehri, and serving it at the centre since quite a few days now... When I was visiting the centre on the first day, I observed that the labourers don’t have clothes and they were unable to sleep properly because of mosquitoes. So I also tried and managed to arrange clothes and mosquito coils for them, and even toys for the kids. But, the coils didn’t work! Then I went looking for an electrician, and found one who agreed to arrange electric boards for operating liquid mosquito repellents... When I saw the migrants sleeping in peace, I had tears in my eyes.” And when comes the time of Iftar, evening meal post prayers, there’s a nearby shopkeeper, Abdul, who takes it upon himself to come to the service of those wanting to break their fast. Gagandeep informs that Abdul distributes rusk in the evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/ramzan-during-covid-19-migrant-labourers-get-sehri-and-iftari-donations/story-gGpZ4IYt0zqNlRbWYZUyDN.html
21-05-2020||Chandigarh||Deadline of Chandigarh smart city projects extended by 2 months||The Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) has extended deadline of all ongoing projects by two months due to the time lost during the lockdown. CSCL CEO KK Yadav said although all allotted works had been restarted, the deadline had been extended by two months. “However, we expect the e-governance project to be launched on June 1 with at least half of 28 services planned in it,” said Yadav. The e-governance project will provide major public services online including building plans. Yadav said that they have already launched their web portal. Also, the public bicycle sharing project that was to start from June in a phased manner will now commence from August, said CSCL officials. Under the first phase, 200 dock stations are to be set up where 2,000 cycles will be available on rent. The fixed hourly rates will be ₹10 per hour for non-members and ₹5 for members. The annual membership fee will cost ₹200.Also, the construction of three garbage transfer stations, aimed at replacing storage of collected waste at sector-based sehaj safai kendras, is also not expected before August or September. CSCL allotted the work to M/s Hyva India Private Limited, Mumbai, in January with six-month deadline at ₹20 crore. The stations will receive segregated waste, sort it into recyclable waste, compact it and send it for processing. Besides, there are several other projects that are at developing or pre-tendering stage that will be revived, such as upgrading of five sewage treatment plants at ₹700 crore, and the 24x7 water supply pilot project in Manimajra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/deadline-of-chandigarh-smart-city-projects-extended-by-2-months/story-vjDkJ0tUj4eKDFXqxiwbZM.html

He said payment of both the farmers as well as arhtiyas is done on the third or fourth day after the wheat purchased in the mandis is lifted for the warehouses. He said wheat is being procured at an MSP of ₹1,925 per quintal, mustard at ₹4,425 per quintal and gram at ₹4,875 per quintal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/71-lakh-mt-wheat-procured-dushyant/story-QtWeuEdgWlswUUBSODhFxO.html
21-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh airport ready to resume operations from May 25||After a gap of two months, Chandigarh International Airport is ready to resume its operations with the opening of domestic sector from May 25.Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Wednesday announced on Twitter that “domestic civil aviation operations will recommence in a calibrated manner from Monday, May 25, 2020”. The airports were shut on March 25 owing to nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19.“All airports and air carriers are being informed to be ready for operations... SOPs for passenger movement are also being separately issued by the aviation ministry,” he said.Though Chandigarh International Airport Limited (CHIAL) is yet to get any official confirmation, its chief executive officer (CEO) Ajay Bhardwaj said: “We are ready for resumption of operations.” “We are ready for departures and arrival of five flights per hour, but we have to wait for the schedule regarding the number of flights to become operational,” he said.Bhardwaj said the airport office is working as it was before the lockdown and the entire security is in place. “Checking of passengers will be done according to the guidelines issued by the government,” he said, adding that sanitisation of the airport would be done as per the directions of the health department.Air India airport director MR Jindal said: “We will wait for instructions from our headquarters. We are in any case ready as our evacuation flights are already operational. As soon as we get the nod, we will start the bookings.”The Airport Authority of India (AAI) has issued guidelines, stating that passengers should carry a hand sanitiser, wear a mask and download the Aarogya Setu application on their mobile phones.In the past two months, the nationwide lockdown has caused a loss of Rs 15 crore to the Chandigarh airport.The main revenue of the airport is generated under the aeronautical category, whereby the airport charges Rs 800 per passenger from airlines. For instance: An airline flying to Delhi with 80% occupancy pays around Rs 65,000 to the airport per flight. Factor in the commercial revenue in the form of rent of retail shops, office space, car parking and advertisements, the total revenue under both the categories comes to around Rs 30 lakh per day.Before the lockdown, there were around 44 flights connecting the airport to major cities across the country and two international flights to Sharjah and Dubai. The daily footfall, both arrival and departure, was 7,000 passengers. All this has been affected ever since the lockdown began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-airport-ready-to-resume-operations-from-may-25/story-GDin8mxVPHwd14p3Sd7dqM.html
21-05-2020||Chandigarh||‘Farmers unwilling to accept paddy sowing restrictions’||Former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda said on Wednesday that farmers were not willing to accept the restrictions being imposed on them by the BJP-JJP regime for sowing paddy. Addressing a video press conference, Hooda said that despite repeated his requests for reconsideration of orders banning paddy cultivation in parts of the state, the government remains adamant on its decision. “It’s up to the farmer to decide what to sow. The Congress will support him if he decides to sow paddy or any other crop,” he added.The leader of opposition said such decisions should be taken with the consent of the farmer. He said the concern about depleting ground water resources was legitimate, but the solution laid on recharging, not banning paddy cultivation. Hooda also highlighted the plight of farmers growing flowers and vegetables.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-unwilling-to-accept-paddy-sowing-restrictions/story-0vme6HaDTZI6RM0ByLLVfO.html

21-05-2020||Chandigarh||Start monthly billing or face action, commission tells Chandigarh power dept||The Joint Electricity Regulatory Commission (JERC) has told the UT electricity department to start monthly billing and improve supply quality immediately, or face action.Currently, more than 85% consumers (domestic and commercial) are being billed bimonthly in the city. A shift to monthly bills can help reduce the financial burden on the power consumers by around 20%, say department insiders.“Depending on the consumption slabs, tariff increases for consumers. For instance, if a household consumes 200 units in a month, then under the bimonthly bill system he has to pay ₹806 for a month. But, under monthly billing, he would be charged ₹652,” said a department official requesting anonymity. For up to 150 units consumed, the consumer is charged at ₹2.75 per unit, and between 151-400 units, the rate is ₹4.80 per unit.The JERC order comes in view of the department’s failure to implement monthly billing for all the categories except agriculture pumping supply, despite repeated directions of the commission.In response, the department had contended in its annual tariff review petition, “The conversion of meter reading from bimonthly to monthly will lead to various problems as there is acute shortage of staff. Further, the software is also required to be amended for monthly billing. Also, the work for installation of smart meters is in progress, which will help for monthly billing.”However, the commission, taking serious note of the department’s non-compliance of its orders, directed it to comply with immediate effect and submit the quarterly progress of the same to the commission.NON-ACHIEVEMENT OF CAPITALISATION TARGETThe commission in its order observed that the department was continuously undertaking lower than expected capitalisation through the years. The department in 2019-20 has undertaken a capitalisation of ₹0.44 crore till September 2019 against ₹69.14 crore approved.Lower capitalisation signifies that not enough efforts have been undertaken in enhancing the reliability and quality of supply to the consumers. This includes undertaking capital expenditure activities necessary for improving the service quality and targeting 24x7 supply to all consumers.Directing the department to improve on the city’s power infrastructure, the JERC order reads, “The petitioner is directed to ensure that the capitalisation targets approved are achieved. In case the petitioner fails to achieve the target, then appropriate penalties shall be imposed at the end of the control period.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/start-monthly-billing-or-face-action-commission-tells-chandigarh-power-dept/story-D3ASwBZOg1kwHTpSJXyLgM.html
21-05-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 report: PGIMER, its community medicine dept again not on same page||The difference in opinion of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER)’s administration and its department of community medicine and school of public health with regards to recommendations and projections made about the Covid-19 outbreak once again came to the fore on Wednesday.A day after a team headed by Dr JS Thakur, a professor in the community medicine department, presented its interim report before the UT administration, comparing the spread of infection in Mumbai’s Dharavi slum and Chandigarh’s Bapu Dham Colony, the PGIMER in an official release stated that the Chandigarh authorities had not asked the institute to carry out any survey of comparing the parameters between the two areas.The release, which was issued even as the report has not been made public, further stated: “We cannot compare different colonies of different magnitude without comparing the ultimate outcome of patients coming out of these. Presently, the outcome of patients who have come from Bapu Dham Colony to the PGIMER has been excellent.”NOT A FIRSTThis is the second time since April that the PGIMER has issued such a “clarification”.Earlier, a controversy had erupted when Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, citing a study by PGIMER experts, had projected that Covid-19 will likely infect 58% of the country’s populationThe institute was quick to issue a press note and clarified: “The PGIMER, Chandigarh, is not aware that any expert/faculty member from the department of community medicine and school of public health of the Institute has carried out any (such) study/estimate.” Later, a showcause notice was issued to Dr Shankar Prinja, who serves as an additional professor at the department and had provided assistance to the Punjab government.In the fresh controversy, a four-member team has presented around 18 recommendations to the UT administration on containment of outbreak in the congested Bapu Dham Colony, which accounts for Chandigarh’s 65% confirmed cases.“Yes, we have briefly mentioned about Dharavi and Bapu Dham Colony situation in the report and the infection rate in both areas,” Dr JS Thakur said before the PGIMER put out an official release. However, he did not respond to calls later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-report-pgimer-its-community-medicine-dept-again-not-on-same-page/story-MENLBpIKYMtTfQbTrH3QyH.html
21-05-2020||Chandigarh||Non-AC CTU buses resume service in Chandigarh, Mohali||After the UT administration decided to start the Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) bus service in the city on Wednesday, Punjab, too, has given it’s approval to let the buses ply within Mohali.After a gap of two months, the CTU bus service resumed operations of non-AC local buses within the city with 47 buses running on 16 routes. The bus service started at around 2pm. The public response was poor as most people were not even aware about the development. The CTU is expecting an improved response from Thursday.“After receiving permissions from neighbouring states, the operations will be scaled up to run 159 buses on 52 routes from 8am to 6pm daily in the tricity. We are expecting their response in a day or two,” said Uma Shankar Gupta, director transport.Haryana government’s decision on Wednesday to not allow inter-state buses is unlikely to affect plying of CTU buses in Panchkula. “The tricity is not considered as an inter-state bus service. Even if the tricity bus service to Panchkula is not allowed, CTU buses will carry passengers up to the borders of Panchkula,” said Gupta.Standard operating procedures have been put into place to ensure the safe transport of people as well as staff. All buses will be sanitised twice a day. Thermal screening will be done at the entry points of ISBT for passengers and at depots for the bus crew.Reusable masks, gloves and face shields have been issued to drivers and conductors. Sanitizer bottles are made available in the buses for usage of crew as well as passengers. Stickers have been fixed on seats where passengers will be allowed to sit as per social distancing norms. No passenger will be allowed to board the bus without wearing a mask. The entry for passengers will be made through the rear door and exit through the front door. Markings have been made at local counters in ISBT to maintain social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/non-ac-ctu-buses-resume-service-in-chandigarh-mohali/story-c6YtVTv40DOgaKYuCG2ilO.html
21-05-2020||City||Setback: Panchkula gets zero star in garbage-free rating||In a setback for the district, Panchkula’s waste management system has received zero star in the latest garbage-free rating released by the central government on Tuesday.However, the municipal corporation (MC) officials are claiming that it happened because they had applied in the 5-star rating category but are still eligible for the 3-star rating category.Under this initiative of the ministry of housing and urban affairs, seven stars are awarded to a city with the perfect waste management system.Last year, the city had applied for a 3-star rating and achieved two stars in the garbage free city rating. It also featured among the top cities under the open defecation-free (ODF) certification, one of the factors that helped it improve the ranking. MC commissioner Sumedha Kataria termed this year’s rating a “setback” and said the ratings didn’t paint the true picture for the district. “Though it is a setback, we still qualify for a 3-star rating. We were ambitious to apply under the 5-star rating category. We will appeal for a review in this regard,” said Kataria.There are three parameters for GFC rating—mandatory parameters, essential parameters and desirable parameters. These include various components such as door-to-door waste collection, segregation at source, litter bins, waste processing, grievance redressal, bulk waste generators compliance, scientific landfill (waste disposed), screening of nallahs, construction and demolition waste (segregation, storage, processing and recycling) among others. As per the figures, Panchkula MC has achieved 55% score in mandatory parameters, 51.25% in essential parameters and 20% in desirable parameters. “The Swachh Survekshan 2020 certification category weightage is of 1,500 marks (star rating and ODF) which makes for 25% of the total marks. Only the star rating result (1,000 marks) is out while the overall result is pending,” she said. In last year’s overall Swachh Survekshan ranking, Panchkula had achieved the 71st rank.Panchkula had made improvement in its Swachhta League rank by getting the 54th rank and the fourth position in Haryana in the Swachh Survekshan 2020 league for the first quarter released by the Government of India on December 31 last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/setback-panchkula-gets-zero-star-in-garbage-free-rating/story-WjSRSHTVXzhKHGdRSQ3itN.html
21-05-2020||City||Three stars for Karnal in swachh ratings||The bastion of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Karnal has received a 3-star rating in the garbage-free cities survey conducted by the Union housing and urban affairs ministry.Though three stars signify a poor rank, with 7-star rating being the highest, Karnal has fared much better than the other cities of Haryana, while being at par with Punjab’s Chandigarh and Nawanshahr. With 1-Star rating, Rohtak also received a mention in the list of 141 cities.Overjoyed by the performance, Karnal mayor Renu Bala Gupta said, “It’s a big achievement for the people of Karnal as it is the only city from Haryana to have grabbed a 3-Star rating, equivalent to Chandigarh.” She congratulated the civic officials and said more efforts were required to improve the rating further.Municipal commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said the star rating is awarded on the basis of 25 key parameters fixed for solid waste management. “Last year there were only 19 parameters, making the survey even tougher this year, but our performance was better,” he added.“Karnal had got 3-star rating last year and more efforts will be made to get better results next year. The capacity of the solid waste management plant is being enhanced with the construction of a new 50 MLD unit,” Yadav said.The commissioner said the city had already improved its rating in the Swachh Survekshan 2021 as it had got 500 points for ODF++ category and the 3-star rating added 600 points.Launched in January 2018, the star rating protocol aims to institutionalise a mechanism for cities to achieve garbage-free status, and to motivate them to achieve higher degrees of cleanliness.As per the reports by Union housing and urban affairs ministry, six cities in the country have achieved 5-star rating, 65 have three stars and 70 got 1-star rating this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-stars-for-karnal-in-swachh-ratings/story-g9ULUbhuHjvss79g1vZs6I.html
21-05-2020||Chandigarh||Red zone tag stays or goes: Chandigarh admn to take call this week||The Chandigarh administration will decide on changing the red zone tag of the city to orange zone within this week.The city was designated a red zone by the central government on April 15. On May 17, the Centre had empowered the states and UTs to delineate a red zone into an orange zone.UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said, “The administration will be taking a call on the issue within this week after taking stock of the situation on the ground.”Parida said the administration was considering allowing opening of salons and barber shops in the next couple of days. The barber shops will have to be opened as per the standard operating protocol prepared by the administration.ADDRESSING ISSUES OF CONTAINMENT ZONESDeputy commissioner (DC) Mandip Singh Brar said though there is a lot of restlessness in the minds of those residing in the containment areas, as per the Centre’s guidelines, further relaxation could not be given. Any relaxation in entry/exit has a risk of infecting the rest of the city. He, however, said all essential items were being provided to the residents through the administration’s machinery.The DC has directed sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) to facilitate solutions to the problems faced by people in the six containment zones in the city — Bapu Dham Colony, parts of Sector 30, Kachhi Colony in Dhanas, Shastri Nagar, parts of Sector 52 and parts of Sector 38.Brar said, “SDMs have been authorised to actively persuade those employers who are threatening to fire people living in containment zones. It is not the fault of people living in such zones. Everybody needs to have sympathetic attitude and help people living in containment zones.”DE-CONTAINMENT AFTER NO CASE FOR 28 DAYSBrar said a locality can only be free from containment zone tag if there is no positive case reported there for 28 consecutive days.Given that no case is reported from the areas for the stipulated period, the expected timeline for the same has been fixed as May 26 for parts of Sector 38, May 27 for Sector 52, May 30 for Shastri Nagar, June 4 for parts of Sector 30, and June 8 for Kachhi Colony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/red-zone-tag-stays-or-goes-chandigarh-admn-to-take-call-this-week/story-JEvHY5Cz6smLYYg3udaLbJ.html

It was earlier sealed from May 15 to May 18. However, with no decrease in cases, the civic body on Wednesday decided to shut the area completely from May 21 (midnight) to May 26. All shops including vegetable vendors, meat, egg, fish shops and bakeries will be closed in the area; only medical stores, dairy and grocery shops will remain open.Majiwada Manpada ward, which covers the Ghodbunder Road area, currently has around 70 cases. The ward officer had tried to restrict movement last week, however social distancing norms were violated still.Anuradha Babar, assistant municipal commissioner of the ward, said, “The shops selling meat, fish and chicken will be closed. No vegetable or any other vendors or temporary shop will be allowed. We will allow home delivery of groceries, vegetables, milk and dairy products. Apart from this only medical and grocery shop can function.”She added, “The social distancing norms were not followed, people still continued to crowd markets and shops.

21-05-2020||Chandigarh||7 Haryana districts on alert as locusts approach state’s borders||With the reports of locusts entering some pockets of neighbouring Punjab and Rajasthan, the Haryana government has put on alert its seven bordering districts — Sirsa, Fatehabad, Hisar, Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Rewari and Mahendergarh — and asked the administrations to take all-out preventive and remedial steps. Locusts, which fly in swarms often covering almost the entire skyline of an area, are short-horned grasshoppers with migratory habit, marked polymorphism (genetic variation within a population) and feed voraciously on crops and vegetations.According to latest reports, locust swarms have already been reported entering Phulon Chadha and Panniwala Morka villages of Sirsa district. Additional chief secretary, agriculture, Sanjeev Kaushal said the state government which was in a constant touch with the Centre’s locust control unit in Jodhpur as well as its Punjab counterpart, agreed locusts were reportedly moving towards the districts bordering Rajasthan and Punjab.He said the government has authorised deputy commissioners to form farmers’ groups, give them advisories and supply the required insecticides with up to 100% subsidy. The local administration has also been supplied stocks of the required insecticides, he added.Locusts swarms are said to be a rare phenomenon as India has not witnessed any full-blown locust cycles after 1962, though in 1978 and 1993, large-scale upsurges were observed, senior Haryana agriculture department officials said, adding that localised locust breeding has also been reported and controlled in 1998, 2002, 2005, 2007 and 2010. The situation remained normal and no major breeding and swarm formation has been reported in this part of the country after that. Such swarms were last spotted in Rajasthan, Punjab and bordering villages of Haryana in February this year, though no crop loss was reported. PREVENTION AND REMEDYBesides insecticides, locusts also can be prevented from settling on crops and vegetations by beating drums/making loud noise. Since swarms settle towards sunset, insecticides sprayed in night or early morning decimate them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/7-haryana-districts-on-alert-as-locusts-approach-state-s-borders/story-cdLAphlQ8i7Ta36bqDo5AI.html

On rechecking 12 of the swab samples tested by the lab, the civic lab found five samples negative, which the private lab had tested positive. The civic commissioner gave the lab 48 hours to give clarification or a criminal case will also be registered against them for violating the norms of Indian Council of Medical Research and wasting the resources of the city.The rising number of COVID cases in the last one week has led to cause of concern for the corporation. The corporation decided to cross check the result of the private laboratory in their laboratory.Vijay Singhal, civic commissioner said, “We tested 12 samples which the laboratory reported positive on May 11 and 12. Out of these, we found five negative. The positive results led to a lot of mental and physical trouble to the people, while the resources of the city’s healthcare system were also wasted on people who were negative. We also realized that the discrepancies were due to the violation of ICMR norms by the lab.”He added that the lab also did random testings without prescription of a doctor, which was not allowed as per the guidelines of the government. “We have served a notice to the lab that if they do not givea satisfactory response to the discrepancies we will register a criminal case against them. We have also proposed to cancel their testing license and they will not be allowed to carry further testings.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-civic-body-sends-notice-to-pvt-lab-over-testing-discrepancies/story-lulXk4wLcHpEQxTYA0SmPJ.html

21-05-2020||City||Mumbra teen dies of liver disease as five hospitals refuse to admit her||A 13-year-old girl from Mumbra, who was suffering from a liver disease, died on Tuesday night after she could not get timely medical help as five hospitals turned her away . The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has initiated an inquiry.Nafiza Shaikh was suffering from a chronic liver disease in which fluid accumulates in the stomach, and gradually makes it difficult to breathe. The fluid has to be extracted if she experienced pain in her stomach.Her father, Hasibur Rehman Shaikh, 60, took her to five hospitals, but they refused to admit her. As he could not arrange for transport, he carried his daughter from one hospital to another.“She had this ailment for a month. We first took her to our doctor’s clinic at Amrut Nagar. But, the doctor had insufficient staff and did not have the equipment to treat my daughter. He wrote a note explaining the situation and suggested a few hospitals where I could seek medication,” said Shaikh, a cleric.“I left the clinic with the doctor’s note around 3pm. As I was about to reach one hospital at 8pm, my daughter’s voice was becoming feeble. I was continuously talking to her to ensure she was conscious. But, I faced the same rejection at that hospital,” said Shaikh.Outside the hospital, some passers-by noticed Shaikh carrying his daughter and contacted a social worker. “He helped my daughter get admission to the hospital by 10pm. But, within an hour, she died. It was seven long hours till we got medical help,” said Shaikh.Shaikh said that he forgot his daughter’s medical file in the TMC office when he went to get her death certificate as he got into an argument with one of the staffers, so he does not know the exact name of the disease.The hospital did not answer the calls.Nafisa was the youngest among Shaikh’s four children.Manish Joshi, deputy municipal commissioner, said, “The health department has initiated an inquiry. This is an unfortunate incident. A special meeting will be held with all private hospital officials on Thursday to discuss the issue. Mumbra is facing a dearth of good private hospitals. Especially during a pandemic, one has to provide help and medical attention to everyone without any bias.

21-05-2020||Mumbai||CM to decide on newspaper delivery soon||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday held a meeting with newspaper distributors of Mumbai and assured that a decision on restarting door-to-door delivery of newspapers, which has been stopped temporarily, would be taken after looking at the current Covid-19 situation. The state government had stopped door-to-door delivery of newspapers and magazines from April 20 due to the extent of the outbreak.Thackeray, in the meeting held via videoconferencing, called it a ‘temporary’ measure and said newspapers are a ‘daily need’. A statement from the chief minister’s office said, “Currently, delivery of newspapers is stopped due to the scare of Covid-19 but this is temporary. We will see the situation and find a way from this soon.” In the meeting, newspapers vendors and distributors said housing societies in Mumbai are also not allowing delivery of newspapers due to fear of Covid-19 spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-to-decide-on-newspaper-delivery-soon/story-vLXsfNLUv0TrVIJAGBoqZP.html
21-05-2020||Mumbai||MMRDA begins work on another 1,000-bed Covid facility||Two days after handing over the first phase of the city’s first open-ground isolation and quarantine facility to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) on Wednesday started works on the second phase of the makeshift Covid-19 hospital at the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) grounds.The new facility will also have 1,000 beds, of which 100 beds will serve as the intensive care unit (ICU), while rest of the 900 beds will have oxygen and non-oxygen facilities, officials said. The work is expected to be completed in another 15-20 days. On Wednesday, authorities started base work and ground-levelling activities for the facility. Unlike the first phase, the second phase will also treat critical symptomatic patients. “The facility will be constructed a little ahead of the existing phase which was handed over to BMC on Monday,” said an official from MMRDA. Both the structures will not face any issues during the upcoming monsoon, officials said.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had asked MMRDA to assist in setting-up modular and quarantine and isolation facility in order to ramp up the number of beds as part of the city’s preparedness to battle the pandemic. Mumbai alone has over 22,000 cases, the highest in Maharashtra.The first phase of the facility was built in 15 days. MMRDA plans to build another isolation and quarantine facility in Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mmrda-begins-work-on-another-1-000-bed-covid-facility/story-p4prMrWW88z9LqUpySNZNO.html
21-05-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 survivor’s tale: Locked up during lockdown in Mumbai||A lot has happened in the last 23 days. On the morning of April 26, I got the phone call I dreaded the most. “Sorry, Ameya, but you have tested positive for Covid-19,” the caller said. Since that day and May 19, Mumbai went from 5,407 positive cases to 22,746, Iqbal Singh Chahal replaced Praveen Pardeshi as the city’s municipal commissioner, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray fended off a constitutional crisis to retain his post, India has gone from Lockdown 2.0 to 3.0 to 4.0, and I returned home to rousing applause from my building neighbours after spending the entire period locked in a 200-sq-ft quarantine centre room.I finally tested negative on May 18, after testing positive four times in three weeks. It was stressful, yes, but I realised a few things that I could do but hadn’t in over 15 years as a journalist: I slept before midnight and woke up at 7am, and in what could only be described as a miracle, I exercised every morning. The last time I remember doing any form of exercise was three years ago when I climbed 13 floors to reach my home during a power outage. Now, yoga, breathing exercises and suryanamaskars have become routine. In ‘normal’ times, I would sleep at 3am and wake up only after 10am. Now, it feels a bit weird to sleep beyond 7am.From setting a ‘drink water now’ reminder on my mobile phone, I have been glugging around four litres of water every day to stay hydrated. Responding instantly to all messages and phone calls – almost all to enquire about my wellbeing – has become second nature, leaving my family and friends with no reason to complain anymore.Vegetables have replaced meat and fish as my staple food. Paneer, which I found in my lunchbox daily, is my new chicken. At dinner, every night, I have discovered biryani can be vegetarian (and, ahem, healthy too).On the flip side, I didn’t taste fresh air ever since I stepped into the quarantine room on the night of April 26. The room – in a hotel-turned-hospital at Goregaon – had an air-conditioner and sealed windows. I found solace looking out at trees swaying in the breeze. In the beginning, an air-conditioner seems like a boon in Mumbai’s hot and humid weather, but as days went by, I could not breathe fresh air, I could not experience the daily smells of the city.The only person-to-person interaction I had in the past three weeks was with the medical support staff who came dressed in personal protective equipment (PPE) to deliver my meals. They left a food packet at the door and rang the bell. I rushed to the door on hearing footsteps, opened it almost simultaneously as the bell rang and engaged in a conversation before they headed to the next door. On most days, it was just small talk, and I didn’t see any of their faces – covered with masks and goggles – but the voices kept me sane. It was surreal – straight out of a post-apocalyptic movie – but I needed it, and I was thankful for the 20-30 seconds of human contact.I tested positive four times before finally beating the virus, but realised during my innumerable conversations with multiple doctors that the test results, after a point of time, don’t matter.What matters, the doctors say, is that one shows no symptoms and feels healthy and fit.I was both healthy and fit, even after 23 days of being confined alone to a room.What helped me stay that way? Moving to the world’s #NewNormal, which for me has just been #Normal.Ameya N Bhise, Senior Associate Editor with Hindustan Times in Mumbai, tested positive for Covid-19 on April 26. He spent 23 days in a quarantine centre before returning home on May 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/locked-up-in-the-lockdown/story-63L5iGiGqivvw4T7ZnJFPJ.html
21-05-2020||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray to attend Opposition meeting called by Sonia Gandhi||Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray will attend a video conference of opposition parties that has been called by Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi on May 22. This is the first time Thackeray will formally attend a meeting of opposition parties after it parted ways with former ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) last year.The Congress has called the meeting on Friday afternoon, during which political parties are expecting to discuss the current situation in the country, including the government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, the migrant issue, and the government’s economic package.A senior Shiv Sena leader confirmed that Thackeray and party MP Sanjay Raut will participate in the meeting. “Uddhav Thackeray will be attending the meeting as most issues are surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic and measures. We are in the opposition and not a part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). We are running a coalition government with the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in the state. So it is no surprise that he [Thackeray] is attending the meeting,” said the Sena leader. Sena has not entered the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA).In January, the Thackeray-led party had skipped all meetings called by Sonia Gandhi to discuss the political situation in the wake of violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University and protests over the Citizenship Amendment Act. Days later Thackeray’s son Aaditya, who is now a cabinet minister in the Maharashtra government, met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi.Thackeray’s decision also assumes significance in the context of political developments in Maharashtra. The state unit of BJP has started mounting pressure on the Thackeray government over its handling of the Covid-19 crisis in Maharashtra, which has the highest number of cases in the country. The Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (in alliance with NCP and Congress) has claimed good coordination between the Centre and the state in tackling the outbreak, but many within the government have blamed the Centre for its poor handling of the migrant issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-to-attend-opposition-meeting-called-by-sonia-gandhi/story-hU1vNoljD20AkvCl7p59RJ.html
21-05-2020||City||West Bengal migrants upset over cancelled train||When a group of migrants heard that Shramik train to Howrah in West Bengal has been cancelled because of cyclone Amphan, they rushed to Panvel railway station on Tuesday to verify it.Sajida Noor, 30, was one of them. She had packed her bags and was all set to leave her rented home at Kamothe. When she learnt that the train was cancelled, she was disheartened.Noor, husband works at a construction site, came to Kamothe four months ago with her eight-month-old girl.“It was a lengthy process to get ourselves registered at the police station. We waited for more than three hours in the sun for our turn and now this,” said Noor, who worked as a domestic help.Navi Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Kumar appealed to migrant not to rush and gather at the railway station. “The train to West Bengal has been cancelled and any change would be communicated to migrants. Also, unless one gets a call from the police, no one should rush to the railway station. The date of the journey on the pass is tentative as a lot of trains are being cancelled and rescheduled daily.”While many migrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have left the city by special trains, Bengal migrants have been stuck as the West Bengal government’s approval came late.“There is no assurance of trains now. We don’t want to starve to death or depend on others. We will hire a vehicle and leave,” said Arun Singh, 39, who worked at construction sites.Activist Vijay Patil, who has been coordinating with migrants for their travel, is flooded with calls from West Bengal migrants.“I keep telling them that they should wait for trains to start and that they should not travel by road or foot,” Patil said.Those migrants, who live with families, are more desperate to return home.“We have been waiting for more than two months now. It is becoming difficult to feed my family. We will start our journey no matter what,” said Sunil Rao, 40, who lives in Kalamboli and worked as a labourer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/west-bengal-migrants-upset-over-cancelled-train/story-NuT3MRqCPA6uF5YG9c643I.html

21-05-2020||Mumbai||225 labourers from Maharashtra return home, 1,875 still stranded in other states||Thanks to the efforts of Raigad-based labour organisation Sarvahara Jan Andolan (SJA) and state authorities, 225 migrant labourers who were stranded in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have come home to their villages in Raigad district over the past week. Another 1,875 migrant labourers from Maharashtra, who are still in these three states, will be brought home over the coming weeks. Based in Mangav, in Raigad district, SJA has been working with migrant labourers for the past 30 years, and many such labourers are members of the organisation. SJA started tracing migrant labourers from Raigad district after some of them got in touch with the organisation after the lockdown was announced. Most of these labourers find work in neighbouring states for four to five months in the year. The rest of the time, they earn their living locally in Maharashtra as daily wagers. When they migrate, they usually take their entire families, including children and the elderly, with them. “When they leave Maharashtra, even they don’t know where the contractor employing them will take them,” said Ulka Mahajan of SJA.The labourers are from the Katkari samaj and are mostly brick kiln workers. A few also make charcoal, which is a skill indigenous to the community. Tracing the migrant labourers was a challenge. “Even though they have mobile phones, they are usually taken to remote areas with no network. Some of them contacted us after the lockdown. We asked these people to trace others from their village or anyone else they knew, and send us the details. The first call I received was on March 24,” said Mahajan.After Mahajan started receiving calls from labourers, members of SJA went from village to village, and pada to pada, to trace those who have left the state in search of work. Ultimately, SJA was able to compile a list of 2,100 workers and their families. “We gave a list to the tribal development department, and the district collector of Raigad. We told them there are 2,000 odd people stranded in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, and they need to be brought back safely,” said Mahajan.The returning labourers are brought till the Maharashtra border by the respective state governments after being screened. From the border, buses organised by the Maharashtra department, bring them to their villages in Raigad. All expenses are borne by the Maharashtra government. The labourers are screened before they leave their temporary homes in the other states. Yashwant Sonu Jadhav, 35, who is from Ambivali village in Raigad, is a member of SJA and had been working in Gaundali village, in Karnataka. “When the lockdown was announced, we had no way of knowing what was going on. Even the news was announced in the local language. The villagers in the area where we worked were so scared of us. Someone came and told us to stop work right away. The villagers barred us from entering the village,” he said. Jadhav then called Mahajan, who told him to stay put.SJA contacted non-governmental organisations in the other states and requested them to distribute food to the stranded labourers. Mahajan said SJA’s first priority was to convince the labourers to stay where they were and not start walking. “We were talking to them right from the beginning, and we had decided that they should not leave; that they were safe where they were. Immediately after lockdown, relief work was organised. We spoke to several organisations and the state government. Contractors made the staying arrangements, but since work was not going on, the labourers were not getting daily wages. So they could not go to local market and purchase anything,” said Mahajan.Jadhav said the labourers were taken care of, but most had no money since they had not been paid since the lockdown. After travelling for two days on state buses, Jadhav returned home on May 17. “I boarded the bus in Karnataka at 5pm and reached the [Maharashtra] border at 10am the next day. We waited at the border for an hour, and then reached our village in Raigad at 11pm the same night,” he recalled.Upon return, the labourers must remain in quarantine for 14 days. Ravikant Jagtap, another labourer from Ambivali who was working in Karnataka, said, “We do not have any money as we have not been paid since March. We found one kilo of rice at our house, and four members of my family have been eating only that for two days now.”Brick kilns are supposed to come under construction work and migrant labourers ,like those SJA has been working with, should be registered under the Maharashtra Buildings and Other Construction Worker’s Welfare Board. Recently, the government announced ₹2,000 for construction workers. However, as these labourers are not registered under the board, they will not be eligible for this money.Mahajan said SJA has also been pushing for the government to start work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) so that these labourers may be employed again. They are also entitled to food grains under the Food Security Act, which is expected to be distributed soon.SJA stressed the need to register migrant labourers under the Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act, so they can avail benefits of the public distribution anywhere outside of their home state. “Since migrant workers are not a vote bank, no one is interested in their issues. This crisis will give us an opportunity and space to highlight their difficulties. Bringing them back was equally difficult for the bureaucracy,” said Mahajan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/225-maha-labourers-return-home-1-875-still-stranded-in-other-states/story-dqjym4Bcpa8kkEv8eFZRLN.html
21-05-2020||City||How’s your health: PM asks in phone call to Hisar cancer patient||A call from the Prime Minister acted as booster dose for a 65-year-old cancer patient from Hisar. How is your health, asked PM Narendra Modi in a phone call to Om Prakash of Sarangpur village on Tuesday night. “My name was randomly selected for a call from PM. At 6.30pm on Tuesday, I got intimation from the prime minister’s office (PMO) and was told that PM Modi would be calling me. Officials asked me not to record the call for security purpose,” said Om Prakash, who has enrolled himself with the Ayushman Bharat scheme. “Right at 8.30pm, I got another call, this time from PM Narendra Modi himself. He asked me about my health and from where I was availing treatment. He also enquired about the problems I am facing,” he added. Soon after PM’s call, a team of health department comprising senior doctors reached Prakash’s house and started a new course of treatment. “My father was diagnosed with throat cancer three months ago,” said his son Sunder Lal. “My father was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Hisar till now. We are labourers by profession. After the PM’s call, we are hopeful that my father would get the best treatment,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/how-s-your-health-pm-asks-in-phone-call-to-hisar-cancer-patient/story-CwPyPe6aq11WjJXlKuzDxM.html
21-05-2020||Mumbai||2,250 fresh cases take state’s tally to 39,297; 65 deaths push up toll to 1,390||For a fourth consecutive day on Wednesday, Maharashtra reported more than 2,000 Covid-19 cases with 2,250 fresh infections, taking the tally to 39,297. According to officials, reconciliation of figures with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal is still in process, resulting in a difference in the cumulative figures.The state reported 65 deaths, the third-highest single-day figure, bringing the toll to 1,390.Of the new cases, 1,372 were in Mumbai, India’s worst-hit city, which also reported 41 deaths. In a bleak first, Mumbai recorded more than 1,000 cases in a day without adding numbers from laboratory tests conducted on previous days.Of the 1,372 cases, 150 were on May 17 and 18 in various laboratories, but were reported on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal on Wednesday. The remaining 1,222 patients tested positive in Mumbai on Wednesday. Of the 65 deaths, 41 were in Mumbai, 13 in Pune, three in Navi Mumbai, two each in Pimpri-Chinchwad, Solapur, Aurangabad city and Ulhasnagar. Thirty-two of the patients who died were above 60 years of age, while 31 were in the age group of 40 to 59 years and the remaining two were below the age of 40 years. Forty-eight of them had high-risk comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension and heart ailments.The state saw 13,375 cases in the past seven days, while the deaths reported in this period were 415. Of them, in Mumbai, 8,371 cases and 245 deaths were during the past week. The month of May saw 28,799 cases and 931 deaths in Maharashtra, which included 17,057 cases and 551 deaths in Mumbai. This means 73.28% cases and 66.97% deaths in the state have come in the past 17 days. The first case of Covid-19 in the state was on March 9. After having crossed 25,000 cases on May 13, the next 5,000 in the state were reported in just three days. On May 9, the state tally had touched 20,220. The state took 53 days for its first 10,000 cases.After the restructuring of red zones by the state government on Tuesday, the area under curbs of the lockdown has reduced to just 18 municipal corporations, having a population of 2.91 crore. Earlier, 14 districts with a population of 6.56 crore were under the red zones. As many as 89.89% cases (33,383 of 37,136 on Tuesday) and 92.45% deaths (1,225 of 1,325 on Tuesday) have been reported in 18 municipal corporations (including nine in Mumbai Metropolitan Region) earmarked as red zones. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), governed by nine corporations and a few municipal councils, has the most Covid-19 cases. Maharashtra government, by its notification issued on Tuesday, allowed more industrial and commercial activities in rural and semi-urban areas by excluding them from red zones. The relaxations, however, will come into force from Friday. “Allowing more activities in more districts will help not only in ensuring revenue generation, but also in sending a positive message to people who are under distress due to the pandemic,” said a cabinet minister. According to a report prepared by the medical education and drugs department on May 20, the mortality rate in the state stood at 3.57%, down from 7.21% on April 12 and 3.71% on May 12. The country’s mortality rate hovers around 3.09%. The report stated that 72% of the admitted patients are asymptomatic, 23% are symptomatic and 5% critical. It also has stated that 27% patients have recovered so far. The number of tests in the state touched 3,07,072 on Wednesday. 2,67,775 of them were negative, which means 12.97% tested positive. Of the 14,074 samples tested in the past 24 hours, 2,250 were positive at 15.98%. A total of 3,48,508 people are currently under home quarantine, while 17,638 are under institutional quarantine. A total of 15,495 teams of health workers have screened 65.11 lakh people; 10,318 patients, including 679 on Sunday, have fully recovered from various hospitals, after testing positive in the past ten weeks. The recovery rate in the state has reached 26.25%.The state has 1,849 containment zones. In Mumbai, the municipal corporation has broken the zones into smaller ones for better monitoring.Gadchiroli was till Sunday the only district (among 36) in Maharashtra to not have a single case. Migrant workers who entered the district from Mumbai last week tested positive on Sunday, after which the district tally has reached eight on Wednesday. “We had been containing it by taking all precautions and due surveillance for more than two months. The virus transmission in the district is through migrants. We are tracing their contacts and have informed the Gondia district administration as a few of them have travelled there. We have prepared a 100-bed Covid-19 hospital in Gadchiroli and tracing for contacts is going on aggressively. We have also requested the administrations of the most affected municipal corporations and districts to not issue passes to travel to Gadchiroli,” said Dhanaji Patil, resident deputy collector of Gadchiroli. Maharashtra has ensured more than 5.20 lakh migrants have returned back to their home states. Anil Deshmukh, state home minister, said that 390 trains departed from various stations in the states. “207 trains departed for Uttar Pradesh, 51 to Bihar, 34 to Madhya Pradesh, 13 to Rajasthan and three to West Bengal. Maharashtra government has been bearing the entire cost of their fare, but they are expected to maintain restraint by not crowding at the stations without having approval for their turn,” he said.State transport (ST) buses ferried 2.02 migrants up to the borders of the neighbouring states or to the railway stations in 15,367 buses. According to an estimate, more than 10 lakh migrants have already moved out of Maharashtra in the last few weeks and more than 5 lakh are still waiting for traveling arrangements. Besides the trains and state transport buses, a few migrants have made their own arrangements in private vehicles, said an official from the relief and rehabilitation department.On Mumbai registering more than 1,000 cases on Wednesday, it was observed that on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, between 885 and 983 persons tested positive in the city, but the total cases recorded crossed 1,000 after adding figures from private laboratory tests of the previous days.However, Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer, BMC, said, “It cannot be counted like that. It is on the basis of reporting. The doubling rate has improved in Mumbai. “ On Sunday,Mumbai recorded 1,571 cases, of which 981 patients tested positive on Sunday, and 590 tested positive between May 10 and May 14. Similarly, on Monday, Mumbai recorded 1,185 cases, of which 885 patients tested positive on Monday, and 300 had tested positive between May 12 and 16, and the results were later updated on the portal. On Tuesday, Mumbai recorded 1,141 cases, of which 983 patients tested positive on Tuesday, and remaining 428 patients were tested in labs between May 14 and 16, but the results were later updated on the portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-250-fresh-cases-take-state-s-tally-to-39-297-65-deaths-push-up-toll-to-1-390/story-gKB0YDXEM6Sz7SZeYesLAK.html
21-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC designates cemeteries for Christians, Chinese and Jews||After members of Christian community complained about lack of burial spaces for bodies of Covid-19 victims, the civic body issued a circular designating four cemeteries for Christians, two for Chinese and one for the Jewish community.Last month, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had allowed burial within city limits, provided the ground is large enough to ensure that there is no threat of transmission to the area’s residents. Other groups that traditionally bury their dead were asked to cremate bodies. However, 20 Muslim cemeteries were allotted for burials.Following which, the civic body faced a backlash from other minority communities which said that it hurt their religious sentiments that provisions for their dead were not taken into consideration.On Sunday, a 61-year-old Christian woman from Mahim had to be cremated at Oshiwara crematorium, when the family was not provided with a burial space in cemeteries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-designates-cemeteries-for-christians-chinese-and-jews/story-bthGbZufsYm1w7iplaRv2I.html
21-05-2020||City||Migrants face unending wait for buses in Thane||Padma Bhakar, 26, a resident of Basti village in Uttar Pradesh, is four months pregnant and has been standing at Majiwada junction in Thane since Tuesday waiting for a bus. She is carrying her three-year-old boy and has hardly eaten anything.“We travelled from Bhiwandi to Majiwada junction by asking for a lift from people. I am tired of this endless wait for a bus,” said Padma. Her husband Sanjeev managed to get into a bus on Tuesday but had to alight as by the time Padma and her son boarded, the seats were full.“The moment a bus comes, everyone rushes in. We have been surviving on biscuits for the past 48 hours,” said Sanjeev, 29, who used to work as a mason in a construction company in Bhiwandi.Like them, hundreds of migrants, including pregnant women and children, are waiting at various junctions in Thane, Bhiwandi and Kalyan for days to board state transport buses provided by the Thane district collector to go to their hometown.Ravindra Kumar, 33, an autorickshaw driver, who is from Madhya Pradesh, has been waiting at Durgadi junction in Kalyan with a group from his village.“On Saturday, we were told that a bus will depart from here, so we gathered here,” said Kumar, adding his house owner in Kalyan will not take him back.Till now, around 56,000 migrants from across Thane district have been sent home by the district collector in buses and train. However, lakhs are still waiting for their turn.“We understand their situation. We are making all effort to provide them transport and meals. Our volunteers are also distributing food to those waiting at junctions. We request everyone to not step out of their homes,” said Rajesh Narvekar, district collector, Thane. A total of 21,500 migrants have been sent in 17 trains and 34,500 have been ferried in 1,553 buses to their native places in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Jharkhand.Lack of coordination and announcement about buses and trains is adding to the chaos. “Some of us have been left as we do not get proper information,” said Shakti Singh, 37, a resident of Rajasthan. “I did not have a proper meal for two days.

After a 29-year-old labourer died and was taken to the hospital for a coronavirus test, his friend went to NMMC hospital on Saturday to collect the body after the test report came. But, the hospital authorities could not find the body. Two days later, the NMMC hospital learnt that the body was handed over to Dashrat Suryawanshi, a mason from Digha, thinking it to be his daughter’s. Suryawanshi’s daughter died of jaundice on May 4 and he took her body to the NMMC hospital for a coronavirus test. Both the labourer and the girl had tested negative for Covid.He claimed that the hospital staffers showed him the body from far and he thought it was his daughter’s and cremated it. NMMC chief Annasaheb Misal said, “An inquiry has been initiated and I am waiting for the reports. Based on the reports, action will be taken.”The police registered a first information report (FIR) against the two people.Sanjeev Dhumal, senior police inspector, Vashi, said, “The case has been registered against sanitation staff from the morgue, Sunil Veljibhai Waghela, for being irresponsible, and Dashrat Suryawanshi for wrong identification of the body. Both are in their 40s and a case has been registered under section 297 of Indian Penal Code.”“No arrest has been made. The investigation is still in the primary stage,” said Dhumal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/body-mix-up-case-cops-book-mason-for-wrong-identification/story-w444tPIA9KesxW5NqZfLzK.html

He asked the government to provide enough medical facilities, additional medical staff, and beds, considering the likely caseload in the coming months.Koshyari also directed the state to take special measures for containment zones such as Dharavi. The directives were issued in a high-level meeting called by Koshyari to review the preparedness of the state in dealing with the pandemic. The Governor had called for a joint conference with chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday evening at Raj Bhavan but the latter skipped the review meeting.“The chief minister personally called the Governor and informed him that he would not be able to attend the meeting,” said an official, requesting anonymity. Later, the chief minister’s office clarified that chief secretary Ajoy Mehta attended the meeting called by the Governor on behalf of Thackeray.The Governor had called the meeting a day after a delegation of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders headed by Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, met him on Tuesday. “Considering the number of cases in June and July, be prepared from now onwards. The state government should prepare to have enough medical facilities, doctors, staff and beds ready considering the likely caseload in the coming months,” the Governor said.He asked the government to keep a dashboard providing handy information about the availability of beds, doctors, nurses, and para-medical staff for the entire state so that the same could be deployed as and when required.He also suggested that the state consider providing incentives to frontline staff like sanitation workers, police, health workers, and ward boys who are doing commendable work in the battle against Covid-19. Koshyari also urged the state administration to take steps to ensure that non-Covid patients do not suffer for want of medical facilities.A presentation on the situation in Mumbai was made by BMC commissioner IS Chahal, while Dr Pradip Vyas, health secretary apprised the Governor about the preparedness of the state.Koshyari also reviewed arrangements made by the state to send migrant workers to their respective hometowns and the status of relief camps started for migrant workers in Maharashtra.The meeting was attended by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, additional chief secretary (home) Sanjay Kumar, DGP Subodh Jaiswal, additional chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, additional chief secretary Nitin Kareer, additional chief secretary Manoj Saunik and other senior officials.On Tuesday, Fadnavis had alleged that the health system of the state has collapsed. “Covid-19 patients are not getting beds in hospitals. The state seems to have not taken appropriate steps to deal with the crisis. Hence, Maharashtra has a maximum number of cases across the country and the numbers are still rising,” he had said in his memorandum. The former CM had also demanded a financial package for the state.On Wednesday, state BJP president Chandrakant Patil also declared plans to organise a protest on May 22, for which where party workers have been directed to put up black flags at their houses and wear black armbands to protest the failures of the state government.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Wednesday said the protest declared by the BJP is an insult to the corona warriors. “People will fail such attempts as the state is united in this fight against the coronavirus. We need to be united in this health crisis,” Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/governor-koshyari-asks-state-to-prepare-for-june-july-cm-uddhav-thackeray-skips-review-meeting/story-vTJBs4Xb4SEdwet0hSZJoM.html
21-05-2020||Chandigarh||All 22 Haryana districts classified as orange zones||The Haryana health department on Wednesday categorised all 22 districts of the state into orange zone in terms of Covid-19 spread. Only two districts – Sonepat and Faridabad – were marked as hotspots or red zones prior to the Wednesday’s classification done by the state government. Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said six parameters along with their critical and desirable values as communicated in May 17 guidelines issued by the Union health ministry were taken into consideration to delineate the 22 districts in orange zone. “We analysed and found that all our districts are leaning more towards the desirable values. We are not yet there as far as desirable values are concerned, but none of our districts are comprehensively leaning towards the critical values,” Arora said.The six parameters on the basis of which fresh evaluation has been done are total number of active cases, active cases per lakh population, doubling rate (calculated over seven-day period), case fatality rate, testing ratio (number of tests per lakh population) and sample positivity rate (confirmation rate).The benchmark for critical and desirable levels are, however, dynamic and can be revised by the Union health ministry as per the evolving situation at the field level, officials said.‘Only containment zones are relevant now’ Top state officials said in the changed scenario post-May 17, wherein more relaxations have been given in Lockdown 4.0, the relevance of red, orange and green zones has greatly reduced. “What actually matter now are the containment zones. The primary area is a containment zone where intensive action needs to be taken to break transmission. This area should be well defined by the district administration. Stringent action needs to be initiated within these zones in term of active search of cases, testing of all cases, contact tracing, strict enforcement of social distancing norms, identification of local community volunteers, emphasis on hand hygiene and use of masks. The containment zones have to be delineated based on mapping of cases, geographic dispersion of cases and contacts, area having well demarcated perimeter and enforceability of perimeter control,” said an official.How these districts became orange zonesNo district has more than 200 active cases – a desirable valueNo district has more than 15 active cases per lakh population – a desirable valueOnly Dadri, Faridabad, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Mahendergarh, Rewari and Rohtak have doubling rate of more than 14 days – a critical valueOnly Panipat and Rohtak have case fatality rate of more than 6% – a critical valueAll districts have testing ratio of more than 65 tests per lakh population – a desirable leaning valueAll districts have sample positivity rate (confirmation rate) of less than 2% – a desirable value||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/all-22-haryana-districts-classified-as-orange-zones/story-Y7pxIA8wTtRNeclR7syCiP.html

21-05-2020||Chandigarh||Little heed to night curfew, social distancing in 22 sites across Chandigarh: Police report||Chandigarh residents seem to have turned a deaf ear to the call for safety measures to prevent the spread of Covid. An extensive internal report prepared by Chandigarh Police, after a detailed inspection, reveals that social distancing norms are being violated in most parts of the city from 7am to 7m, when people are free to move about.The report made by senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nilambari Jagadale has been sent to all three field deputy superintendent of police (DSPs) and superintendent of police (SP, city). She has also asked them to enforce social distancing via a special drive in at least 22 sites highlighted in the report. They must deploy adequate police force for effective implementation of UT guidelines, and any laxity on part of DSPs will be viewed seriously.The report says that social distancing has been thrown to the winds at 22 sites. These include main markets of Sector 7, 8, booth market of Sector 27, electronic market of Sector 18, mobile market of Sector 22, rehri market of Sector 19, Krishna market of Sector 41, motor market of Sector 28, sabzi mandi of Sector 17, burial market, motor market of Sector 28, inner market of Sector 35, and markets of Sectors 15, 16, 23, 32, 35, 37, 44 and 46.On an alarming note, the report also says that people are freely roaming around during night curfew mostly in colonies and rural areas, especially in Bapu Dham and Kacchi colony which are containment zones. This raises concerns that if residents can ignore norms in containment zones which are guarded by police as well as CRPF personnel, then adherence to norms can hardly be expected in other areas.The ministry of home affairs, while relaxing curbs, had ordered strict enforcement of social distancing in markets and public places. However, the police report says these safety measures have been forsaken.On Tuesday, the number of confirmed Covid cases crossed the 200 mark in the city, of which more than 90 have recovered. Other areas where people have ignored nigh curfew are Mauli Jagran, EWS colony in Dhanas, Dadumajra, Indira colony, Tin colony in Sector 52, Sansi Colony Sector 38, Ram Darbar, Hallomajra, Palsora, Modern Housing Complex (MHC), villages including Dariya, Butrela, Attawa, Kishangarh, Khudha Ali Sher, Maloya, Burail, in societies of Sectors 49, 50, 51 and 63, as well as Sectors 22, 46 and 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/little-heed-to-night-curfew-social-distancing-in-22-sites-across-chandigarh-police-report/story-6KUNnQQOPxDOr8PDrK1HDN.html

Sandhu added that all members have followed safety protocols. “Earlier, on busy day we had up to 500 golfers playing in a day, but now we will allow up to 170.” “It’s unusual to play while wearing a mask but let’s face reality and get used to it,” said Jeev, who teed off in an afternoon session.Many other sports discipline centres have opted to wait for standard operating procedures (SOP) from the government or sports department before they resume operations. Total Tennis Academy, which runs many centres in Chandigarh, including one in Sector-11 YMCA, have decided to wait and watch through the week.Chadha, however, was optimistic about having his centre up and running by June 1. “I am thinking of starting full sessions by June 1. With six courts, I could accommodate 12 players and have 2-3 sessions in a day. In between, we will sanitise the entire centre,” he added.Chandigarh Lawn Tennis Association (CLTA) is hopeful of getting SOPs from both UT sports department and All India Tennis Association (AITA) and aspires to begin operating this weekend.“The management will take a look at the SOPs and we could have things in place by this weekend. Needless to say, but safety of trainees and staff is of utmost importance,” said Megh Raj, chief operating officer of CLTA.Meanwhile, PU sports director Parminder Singh said, “We are working on the modalities of how to resume sports activities. In coming days, we will release the SOP and gradually begin activities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/golf-tennis-take-lead-in-opening-others-await-more-clarity-sops-in-ut/story-SSqXoTiKjbwfODH4CjfadK.html

21-05-2020||City||Mayor okays movement of vehicles on Ludhiana’s NH-44 flyover||Following a week-long trial run on both sides of the NH-44 flyover, situated near Mohan Dai Oswal Cancer Hospital, mayor Balkar Sandhu allowed movement of traffic on the bridge on Wednesday. The flyover is a part of the Jalandhar-Panipat highway project and has been hanging fire for around nine years.The mayor said that the Sherpur Chowk flyover is expected to be completed by May 30.He said a one side of the flyover, from Delhi to Jalandhar, has already been opened for movement of traffic and the construction work on the other side is expected to be completed by May 30. Rahul Verma, member of Road Safety Council, said the commuters coming from the Jalandhar side will not be able to move into the city through Sherpur Chowk and will have to exit from Tibba Road exit point. He said with the completion of this flyover, the traffic is expected to increase at Samrala Chowk as the truckers, who used to used to exit the highway from Moti Nagar point, will have to exit through Tibba Road point and move towards Transport Nagar through Samrala Chowk.“Traffic woes are expected increase at Samrala Chowk after the lockdown and the commuters coming from Jalandhar will have no exit point to enter the city at Sherpur Chowk. They will have to take a u-turn from Focal Point area. We are working to find some solution for these problems,” said Verma.The cancer hospital flyover project had to be completed by March 31, but it was stopped owing to the pandemic-induced lockdown. The construction work commenced amid the lockdown on April 23 after the administration gave the approval with the condition that the contractors and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will have to follow the guidelines issued by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mayor-okays-movement-of-vehicles-on-both-sides-of-ludhiana-s-nh-44-flyover/story-QwQMwSyIiTS2JCJeNTXaBP.html

As per directions from the district education office, school principals started the distribution process from Tuesday amid the pandemic-induced lockdown.These books are provided free of cost to all students from Classes 1 to 8 and to those under reserved categories in Classes 9 and 10. The city school principals have stated that they received copies of one textbook for Classes 7, 10 and 12 and four textbooks of Class 9 and all textbooks of Class 6.PARENTS, STUDENTS TO MAKE MORE ROUNDSMeanwhile, parents and students said the schools should have started the distribution process only once they received all textbooks for all classes as they will have to make more rounds to collect all textbooks.Sushil Kumar, a parent, said, “My son studies in a government school and was handed over only one new book today. When I enquired, my 16-year-old son said the school received only one new textbook, so he has to visit the school again to get the rest of the books. The schools should have started the distribution process once they received all textbooks.”SOCIAL DISTANCING NORMS IN PLACEStudents have been asked to visit the school at an allotted time and adhere to social-distancing norms. Circles have been made in the school corridor and a peon has been deputed to make all students sanitise their hands before collecting books.MANY SCHOOLS DISTRIBUTE OLD TEXTBOOOKSMany government school heads gave old textbooks to the students from the book banks that they had set up in their school years ago.

21-05-2020||Delhi||Man uses poison, packed as corona medicine, in bid to get rival murdered||The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic gave a Delhi man who suspected his wife of having an affair with a home guard with an idea for doing away with his assumed rival -- poison packaged as coronavirus disease medicine. To put his plan into action, the 42-year-old man who lives in outer Delhi’s Alipur hired two women, who posed as health workers and, on Sunday, visted the home of the 38-year old home guard (the home guards is a volunteer-based paramilitary force that assists the police) and administered the medicine to him and three members of his family. All four took ill shortly after and had to be hospitalised. The police said the condition of the victims is stable. Investigators used CCTV camera footage to identify the two women, who, on questioning, directed them to the mastermind, according to Gaurav Sharma, the deputy commissioner of police (outer-north district). All three have been booked for attempt to murder and arrested.The prime suspect runs a business in Alipur. He suspected that his wife was having an affair with the home guard, who lives in the same area. “He wanted revenge. So, he hired two women from another village to kill the home guard. He asked them to pose as health workers and poison him on the pretext of offering him medicine,” Sharma said.On Sunday afternoon, the two women visited the home guard’s house and claimed to be health workets. They administered the medicine to the home guard and “his mother and their two relatives; the four began to feel unwell immediately and the two women slipped away,” he addedThe four victims were rushed to Raja Harishchandra Hospital where they were treated and are now out of danger, Sharma said. The police are yet to determine what poison was used in the crime.This is the second known case of Covid-19 being used as a tactic to commit a crime in Delhi. On May 1, a woman strangled her husband and tried to pass off his murder as a case of death by Covid-19, the police said.In that case, an autopsy helped bring the crime to light.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-uses-poison-packed-as-corona-medicine-in-bid-to-get-rival-murdered/story-2WFMo0Zr3MbTNYiOBUyuFM.html
21-05-2020||Delhi||Too early to resume Metro service, says Delhi High Court||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday declined to order the Centre or Delhi government to resume the Metro services in the Capital, remarking that it was “too early” to pass such a direction. It said it was satisfied with the transport arrangements made for now.Metro services were suspended from March 22, when the janta curfew was observed, and continued to be suspended since. In its latest guidelines, issued upon extending the lockdown till May 31, the ministry of home affairs did not allow resumption of Metro services.The Delhi HC order came while disposing of a plea filed by law student Shreesh Chadha through advocate Prashant Vaxish, seeking the resumption of all public transport while mandating social distancing norms and also sought directions to the government to frame guidelines for ensuring the safety of commuters.“It has been just two days since the new rules and regulations have come into force. It is too early in the day for learned counsel for the petitioner to urge that there is an inadequate supply of public transport for insisting that DMRC (Delhi Metro Rail Corporation) must be directed to operate the Metro Rail in Delhi immediately,” the bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad said, while adding that the Metro was a “lifeline” of the city.The counsel for the Delhi government told the court through video conferencing that transport services in the city had resumed. He gave the court an order issued by the city government on the resumption of the services of bus, autos and cab aggregators.However, Vaxish contended that there were only 2,500 buses, which was not enough as the order said that the number of passengers in each bus would be no more than 20 to maintaining social distance. The other buses, he said, were being used to ferry migrant workers and essential service providers. He sought a direction to the Delhi government to hire more private buses as they had done during the time of odd-even scheme to control air pollution.The Delhi government counsel said that there were adequate number of buses and pointed ouot that private and government offices have been told to allow their employees to work from home as much as possible. Similarly, all shops and market complexes were asked to open on an odd and even basis.“As of now, there is adequate public transport that has been permitted to be operated by the Government of NCT to meet the requirement of the public at large. As and when the lockdown is further relaxed, the DMRC shall also be permitted to operate the Metro Rail in terms of the directions that may be issued by the Centre and the Delhi government subsequently,” the court said.The court asked the DMRC to ensure that adequate steps are taken to maintain social distancing once the service is permitted.Appearing for the DMRC, its counsel, in an affidavit told the court that the ministry of urban development and housing affairs (MUDHA), formed detailed procedures in case the Metro services were to resume.The DMRC said that the commuters would be asked to sit or stand on alternative places to maintain social distancing, while stating that the dwell time at its stations would be increased to give time to the passengers to alight and board the train. The metro also said that all norms and guidelines issued by the Centre to maintain social distancing would be followed.The Delhi government and DMRC spokespersons refused to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/too-early-to-resume-metro-service-says-delhi-high-court/story-w1OgMOpPMOFtO2A2lPTquM.html
21-05-2020||City||Delhi Police probing two case of fake UPI IDs in name of PM-Cares Fund||Delhi Police is probing two cyber fraud cases where fake Unified Payments Interface (UPI) IDs of the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM-Cares) Fund were created to dupe people into parting with money for donations to the fight against Covid-19.Delhi Police cyber cell investigators traced people behind the fraud to some areas in Jharkhand, including Jamtara, which has emerged as a hub of cyber frauds such as phishing in recent years.Cyber cell officials said that during an investigation they came across 80 fake UPI IDs that were created around the same time in March when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the PM-Cares Fund.“All such fake UPI IDs, which looked similar to the original ID of PM-Cares Fund, were deactivated as soon they came to our notice, either during the investigation or flagged by other agencies. A majority of the scamsters have been traced to areas in Bihar and Jharkhand’s Jamtara, Hazaribagh,” said deputy commissioner of police (cyber cell) Anyesh Roy.The ongoing lockdown for the coronavirus disease outbreak and the fact that the racketeers are located in thickly forested areas where Maoist rebels are active have prompted investigators to delay sending in raiding teams to the areas. Senior officers said the operation may last more than a week and arranging logistics such as food and accommodation in the terrain would be difficult in the present circumstances.“We will soon be sending our teams to catch the suspects,” said DCP Roy.A senior police officer familiar with the developments said two brothers were arrested in Hazaribagh last month for being part of the racket that had duped people to the tune of around R52 lakh in the guise of donations to the PM-Cares Fund. The racket’s mastermind is still at large.“Our teams will also get in touch with the Hazaribagh police and if required, the two brothers will be questioned to ascertain if their gang created the fake UPI IDs that came to our notice..,” the officer said on condition of anonymity.The city police detected the first fake UPI ID on March 28, just a couple of hours after the Prime Minister announced its formation and called for donations to help fight the Covid-19 outbreak.DCP Roy said that around R47,000 was deposited in the fake UPI ID “Pmcare@sbi” by the time it was blocked and a case was registered. Within a week, the cyber cell officials came across another case wherein the screenshot of a fake UPI ID was uploaded on social media, urging people to donate to the fund.“We registered a separate case and both the cases were probed. The fraudsters in both the cases were traced to Bihar and Jharkhand,” he added.Last month, Maharashtra cyber police officials said racketeers were using fake links to dupe people in the name of online donations to the PM-Cares Fund and that 78 cases were registered for spreading misinformation online on the coronavirus outbreak. The officials asked the people to use the authentic link, which is pmcares@sbi, to donate funds to fight the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-police-probing-two-case-of-fake-upi-ids-in-name-of-pm-cares-fund/story-SwfE3AmsEIIzBScFRasKFK.html
21-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi mulls hiring private buses for public transport||Following reports of social distancing norms being flouted inside Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and cluster buses, and at bus stops, the state government is mulling to hire private buses on a contract basis to cater to the increasing demand.To ensure strict compliance of the number of passengers permitted in each vehicle, the government also tweaked its standard operating procedure (SoP) on Wednesday, to include a clause on initiating penal action against conductors, marshals, drivers and even passengers for non-compliance.Transport minister Kailash Gahlot said bus drivers, conductors and marshals have been strictly instructed not to admit more than 20 passengers per bus. “Extra passengers boarding the buses will be first requested to de-board. If any passenger refuses to de-board, a police complaint at 100 will be registered. If there is any violation of these instructions then stringent action will be taken against the driver, conductor, and marshal,” he said.Gahlot said his department is also considering hiring private buses to strengthen the public transport system, which is currently not able to cater to the demand, keeping restrictions in mind. The Delhi Metro, which used to ferry at least 2.7 million passengers a day, has been shut for more than 50 days now.A senior government official said that the initial report on the first two days of the relaxations under lockdown 4.0 in Delhi suggests that the number of people at the bus stops was much higher than the number that could be catered to by the services. “If things do not stabilise in a day or two, we will have to hire private buses like the government did during the odd-even road rationing drive. The government would pay the private bus operators at a decided per-kilometre rate. It would be beneficial for them as well, because they are currently suffering heavy losses as their buses are currently lying idle,” said the official, on condition of anonymity.Around 2,000 DTC and cluster buses of the city’s fleet of 6,487 buses have been deployed for public transport. Over 1,400 DTC buses have been deployed on Covid-19 duty, for transportation of migrant workers and for maintaining law and order in the city. Despite the high demand, the buses could ferry only about 1 lakh passengers on the first day, due to the restrictions. Usually, Delhi’s state-run buses ferry at least 40 people per bus, with a daily average ridership of over 3.2 million pre-Covid. The transport minister called for that public cooperation, in wearing masks and practising social distancing. “The people must ensure that they will not violate the rules in autos, buses or bikes. If such a violation takes place, action will be taken,” Gahlot said. He said that more cluster buses were on the roads on Wednesday, as drivers staying in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana reached Delhi a night before, to report to work. As per the revised SoP for public transport, wearing masks is mandatory, but downloading the Aarogya Setu App is not compulsory. Sanitisers will be made available on every bus and after completion of each trip, it will be the responsibility of the conductor or the marshal to sanitise the seats and common points of contact. For para-transit vehicles such as autos, e-rickshaws and gramin sewas, the driver will have to carry a disinfectant solution and clean the seats and contact areas after dropping each passenger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-mulls-hiring-private-buses-for-public-transport/story-YdsSA8nvIynTmbMiuLZdcO.html
21-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt asks Centre for 262 more trains to send over 400,000 back home||The Capital has kick-started a major repatriation exercise for stranded migrant workers, students, pilgrims, tourists and others. While around 87,600 individuals left the city in 73 special trains and around as many buses between May 7 and Wednesday, nearly 410,000 individuals are still waiting to go home, government records showed.“Currently, there are 410,000 applicants from states that include Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Odisha and Tamil Nadu. Around 380,700 of them are from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh,” an advisor at the Delhi chief minister’s office (CMO) said, asking not to be identified.“We have urged the Central government to allot us 262 trains in four days to expedite the repatriation. We have sent them details. Today, 25 Shramik Special Trains left Delhi with around 37,500 migrants for different parts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar,” deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said.A spokesperson for the railways ministry declined to comment on the status of the application for the 262 trains sent by the Delhi government, which is routed through the Union home ministry. However, a senior railways official said that details about such a request could not be shared because people might start thronging railway stations in the hope of being able to get transport back home.On April 29, the Union home ministry issued guidelines for the interstate movement of stranded individuals, following which the Delhi government distributed forms in its 400-odd centres, where around 20,000 stranded migrant workers had taken shelter since March 25 when the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 was implemented. “Most of them have left Delhi by now,” a government official said.On May 7, the first Shramik Special Train left Delhi for Chhatarpur in Madhya Pradesh with 1,050 passengers—all of them were lodged in several government centres, officials said.By then, the Delhi government had also set up a website through which stranded individuals, who had not taken shelters in the government-run centres, and instead stayed in factories, construction sites or shared rooms with other labourers in the vicinity of industrial areas, could apply for repatriation.Till Wednesday evening, as many as 73 Shramik Special trains have left Delhi, with the highest number heading to Uttar Pradesh (34), followed by Bihar (27), Madhya Pradesh (three), Jammu & Kashmir (two), Jharkhand (two), and Chhattisgarh (one), Karnataka (one), Kerala (one), Maharashtra (one) and West Bengal (one), data shared by Northern Railways showed.Interestingly, some of the longest journeys were arranged through buses—three buses for Assam (2,050km), one each for Manipur (2,400km) and Arunachal Pradesh (2,550km). “In these cases, the buses were arranged by the governments or NGOs in the respective home states. The number of applicants from these states is also relatively low,” the government official quoted earlier said.Buses have also left for Ladakh, Haryana and Punjab, government records showed.According to government officials, all passengers are screened before boarding buses which take them to the railway station from the screening centres. The consent of destination states is not required for running Shramik Special Trains to ferry migrant workers, the ministry of railways said Tuesday, revising its earlier order wherein it was mandatory for both states to mutually agree to run the trains. This comes after the home ministry issued a fresh set of guidelines to run the Shramik Special Trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-asks-centre-for-262-more-trains-to-send-over-400-000-back-home/story-GQC60vayVHyw0ioU6inmZJ.html
21-05-2020||Gurugram||Industrial activity in Udyog Vihar hit as workers unable to cross border||Despite the relaxations allowed by the government under the fourth phase of the lockdown, industrial activity in Udyog Vihar has not resumed as many industry owners and employees in these units do not have movement passes to enter the city from Delhi.Industrialists in Udyog Vihar said that they have applied for 60 to 70 weekly passes; mostly for owners living in Delhi, whose movement has been restricted due to strict measures at the border. The industry owners also said that a large majority of labourers working in Udyog Vihar stay across the border in Delhi villages, such as Kapashera and Samalkha, and due to curbs on interstate movement, the resumption of the industry has been affected.“There is an immediate need to issue weekly passes so that owners and senior officials can resume work. We are also ready to relocate workers from Kapashera and provide them with lodging facilities in our own units or community spaces in Udyog Vihar or nearby areas so that production can restart. Without workers, it is not possible to resume work in factories and the government must consider this option,” Ashok Kohli, president, Chamber of Industries, Udyog Vihar, said.Kohli also said that the association submitted around 60 to 70 names to the district industries department for the issue of weekly passes by the district administration as these unit owners have to travel to Udyog Vihar from Delhi. “We had submitted these names to the authorities around 10 days ago but no action has been taken in this regard despite repeated pleas,” he said.A garment exporter in Udyog Vihar said that almost 70% of their labourers stayed in Samalkha and Kapashera, and since these workers were not able to enter the city, work is badly affected. “The manufacturing units in Udyog Vihar can’t execute orders because the labour is not available,” Satyendra Singh, general manager, East West Exports, said.The industrialists said that identity cards should be considered valid documents for entry to the city.A senior official of the department of industries said that movement passes are not a matter of right but are being issued based on merit. “Everything is being done to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease but a number relaxations have been given to industry and commercial units in the state under Lockdown 4.0,” he said on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/industrial-activity-in-udyog-vihar-hit-as-workers-unable-to-cross-border/story-wQ2ve8kcrHq4o40GtcUf3L.html
21-05-2020||City||Desperate to get home, migrants mortgage their plots for loans||New Delhi: Desperate to get home and exasperated by what seems like an unending wait to register for a Shramik Special train, around 250 workers in Shahpur Jat have spent every last penny they had, and beyond, to hire private buses for their journeys. With private agencies charging upwards of Rs 4,000 per adult for a seat on a bus to West Bengal, Jharkhand, or Bihar, some workers had to get loans, while others had to mortgage their assets to be able to afford the trip. If one person fell short, another pitched in however possible.According to migrants in the south Delhi area, between Sunday night and early Monday morning, around 250 workers left in six buses. All of them were employed in embroidering work at Shahpur Jat, which houses a number of upmarket clothing stores. But since the lockdown, there has been no work, and their scant savings have run out.Each bus seated between 70 and 75 people, and none of the passengers were issued medical screening certificates, throwing the guidelines for inter-state travel to the wind. Hamidul Manjhi, who left for his village in West Bengal’s Paschim Medinipur district on Monday morning, had only reached Jharkhand on Wednesday noon. “We had to leave as we had run out of money here and there was no way to survive any longer. My two brothers in the village took a loan of around Rs 25,000 from a moneylender that they transferred so we could afford the bus tickets. My father is bed-ridden and my mother recently had a paralysis attack. My brothers said she might die any time, and we must reach before it’s too late,” Manjhi, 35, said on a phone call. He is travelling with his wife, two children, brother, sister-in-law and their two children. They had to pay Rs 4,250 each for five persons, including his 11-year-old son.The family of one of his co-workers at Shahpur Jat, Mafizul, had to mortgage a plot to send him money. “My parents are very worried, because they have nobody to take care of them. This is the harvest time, and I was supposed to be home. I ran out of money here,” said Mafizul, who is also travelling to Paschim Medinipur with his wife and three children.As per the Centre’s norms, private buses ferrying migrants are allowed to move within the city and across borders only with valid inter-state transit passes issued by the district authorities. The passes are issued only after passengers are screened and the destination state permits the travel. A 50-seater bus is allowed to have only 25 passengers to maintain social distancing. Drivers are required to disinfect the buses before and after a trip.However, the district authorities and police denied having issued any such permission for these buses to leave Shahpur Jat. BM Mishra, district magistrate (south) said, “We have not issued any permission for private buses to ferry migrants. If that is the case, enforcement agencies at the city’s borders must look into it. We are in the process of issuing permission for only one group that has hired a private bus for West Bengal. Their screening is being done and information is being shared with the state authorities for the same. Only after the process is complete, will they be allowed to board the bus.”Riyaz Hussain, one of the workers, said people had given up hope and were desperate to leave. There are around 5,000 embroidery workers in the area, of whom around 500 have left, according to many of their colleagues. “Many buses have left without permission. We have applied for permission for 31 workers for West Bengal. Many of them gave up their last bit of money, which they had saved to send home. The total fare for one 50-seater private bus is Rs 1.2 lakh. We asked some NGOs to help, and others have asked their families to send money.”A senior police official who asked not to be named, said, “Around four private buses have left with migrants from the area. They had passes issued by two other districts.” However, east Delhi district magistrate Arun Mishra denied having issued any such pass. “The pass must be forged,” Mishra said. Despite attempts, the Shahdara district magistrate did not respond to requests for comment. In a similar case, the southeast district police on Monday night registered an FIR against a private tourist bus driver and its owner for ferrying 49 migrants to Bihar using a fake transit pass. “The bus driver and owner have been arrested. The bus was traced around 11.45 pm at Tughlaqabad Extension carrying 49 passengers, breaching the norms. He had shown a fake pass and the list of passengers was not shared with the homestate either. It was found that the migrants belong to the Tughlaqabad area and were sent back,” said a senior police official, who did not wish to be named.Sunil Kumar Aledia, a social activist, who works for the homeless, said that a number of private buses have already left with migrants, who were forced to shell out whatever they had, as there was no other option left. “The government must arrange for more buses for a large number of people who are still stranded and ensure medical screening is done. It is taking too long for people to even register or get an assurance from the state authorities,” said Aledia||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/desperate-to-get-home-migrants-mortgage-their-plots-for-loans-to-get-home/story-aMdJHLhB6dcDofuVMp1nBN.html
21-05-2020||Gurugram||Hour-long checking drive leads to massive snarl at Sirhaul Toll Plaza||Thousands of commuters travelling between Gurugram and Delhi were stuck in a jam near Sirhaul toll plaza on the expressway on Wednesday morning after Gurugram police put up barricades to stop and check every vehicle for movement passes. Traffic came to a standstill between 8.45am and 9.45am as commuters tried to get to office after relaxations were announced in the fourth phase of the lockdown that started Monday. The traffic backlog stretched till Shankar Chowk flyover, about a kilometre away, commuters said. The situation normalised only around 10 am when Gurugram police stopped checking every vehicle and instead resorted to random checking. Gurugram police officials said around 8:30 am, during random checking, they found a lot of commuters attempting to cross the border without valid passes. They then decided to check all vehicles crossing into Delhi that led to a jam.Police commissioner Muhammad Akil said that only health workers and others who have valid passes issued by the district administration through the SARAL portal will be allowed to cross the border. “Our deployment at all borders remains the same and there is no change. Although most of the vehicles crossing the border on Wednesday had valid permissions, there were a few which were trying to sneak through. As a precautionary measure, our teams started checking passes of all vehicles during the early morning hours when the maximum number of people head to Delhi. This resulted in minor congestion and we subsequently switched back to random checking,” said Akil.Manmeet Kumar, a resident of Palm Drive on Golf Course Extension Road, said that she had to wait at the border for nearly half an hour on Wednesday morning . “All the lanes leading to Delhi had been barricaded and Gurugram police were allowing entry of vehicles one at a time, which resulted in heavy congestion on the expressway. I was stuck at the border for more than 30 minutes and was finally able to pass by 9.15am,” said Kumar.Vardhaan Agarwal, a resident of DLF 5, said that the backlog of vehicles had started stretching till the Shankar Chowk flyover and he was only able to make his way into Delhi when Gurugram police removed all the barricades and started allowing vehicles to pass through.“In 45 minutes, I must have travelled only around 500 metres. I thought I would be stuck for nearly two hours at the border. But, around 9.30 am, Gurugram police suddenly removed all barricades and started allowing most vehicles to pass through and stopped only a handful. I was able to cross over in the next fifteen minutes,” said Agarwal.After 11 am, the movement of vehicles largely remained unaffected, several commuters stating that they even made their way into Delhi and back, without any checking on both sides.“I had applied for passes on the Saral portal, three days ago but did not get any reply. I had an emergency meeting at my office in Dwarka in Delhi and decided to take a chance. Luckily, while entering Delhi and on my way back into Gurugram no one stopped me to check for a pass,” said Sandeep Kumar, resident of Block E, DLF Phase 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hour-long-checking-drive-leads-to-massive-snarl-at-sirhaul-toll-plaza/story-68pBchoQ3eLkGbJKvZbEbM.html
21-05-2020||Delhi||Workers turned away from screening centres despite reservation messages||There was chaos outside the screening centres set up at two government schools in east Delhi and one in South on Wednesday after hundreds of Bihar-bound migrant workers reached these places to get themselves screened in order to board Shramik Special trains. Although all of them had reached there after receiving a text message confirming their reservations,many of them were turned back by officials who said the trains were full and their names were not on the list.At a school in east Delhi’s Vinod Nagar, the long queue of migrant workers continued till evening. While some of them were waiting for their turn since last night, many had reached there as early as 4am Wednesday. Displaying a confirmation message received on his phone last night, Navi Hasan, who was working in a garment factory in Gandhingar, said he left home at 1am. “I was waiting for this message for the past 10 days. I had no money to pay the rent and so I vacated the room and left for the screening centre immediately on receiving the message last light. I had to walk till here since I could not afford an auto-rickshaw. Now, they are asking me to return tomorrow. Where will I go for the night?” he said.Shramik Special trains are being run to take migrant workers back to their home states under a special arrangement between state governments, according to the Union home ministry guidelines issued on April 29. The Union government bears 85% cost of travel, while the states foot the remaining 15%. Migrants have to apply online for a seat on these trains and they would then receive a confirmation message asking them to report to the screening centres from where the DTC buses will drop them to the Old Delhi railway station. The migrants can also apply offline with the help of government help desks set up at shelter homes and subdivisional magistrate offices. On Wednesday, many like Hasan queued up outside the schools with messages of reservation for trains to Darbhanga, Patna, Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur and Saharsa. The messages were received between 12.55am and 2am Wednesday. “Your journey has been scheduled for May 20. The train will stop at BKM and buses will be provided for other districts near these stations. Food and other arrangements have been made. You are requested to come for screening on May 20 at 8am with your family and luggage,” read one of these messages.Sitting on a pavement outside the school with her five-month-old son, an angry Ramvati Devi said, “Why did they send us a message if we were not supposed to leave today? No one considers us humans. My son is sick and we had come to Delhi for his treatment when the lockdown was announced. We have been staying at a relative’s place since then. Now they are also out of money. Where do we go now?” For Arjun Sade, 25, who had walked from Haryana’s Panipat to Delhi to board a Shramik Special train to his village in Bihar’s Khagaria city, the journey seems never-ending. “I had applied for the train on Sunday and started walking from Panipat to Delhi. It took me two days to reach Delhi. Last night, when I was at Anand Vihar bus stand, I received this message and again I started walking towards the screening centre in Lajpat Nagar. Now, after standing outside this school for more than eight hours, officials are saying I can’t go home today. The battery of my phone is discharged. I don’t know how will I charge it to show them the message again,” he said.A senior police officer in east Delhi, requesting anonymity, said, “There was some confusion on the part of the district administration as people had gathered in large numbers but names of only a few were on the administration’s list. However, police were not informed about any law and order problem.”Arun Mishra, district Magistrate, east Delhi, said the administration did not send messages beyond the train capacity. “Many people gathered there showing forwarded messages. We have not issued so many messages. We do not know how so many people gathered there,” he said.Southeast DM Harleen Kaur said the SMSes was sent to the appropriate number of passengers but many people get more persons as companions. “They will be taken to a shelter home in the district and will be given priority on Thursday’s train,” she said.A Delhi government spokesperson said they have also got to know about a large number of people gathering outside the screening centres. “There is a possibility that many people have reached there with forwarded messages. We are looking into the matter,” the spokesperson said. Back at the Vinod Nagar school, many stranded migrants were allowed inside by 7pm. “After standing in the heat for the whole day, now they have asked us to come in. My friends and I have requested them to drop us anywhere in Bihar and we will walk to our villages from there. Our families are waiting for us,” Harish Gautam, who worked as a labourer in Bhojpuri, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/chaos-outside-screening-centres-as-migrants-gather-in-large-numbers-to-go-on-a-train-to-bihar/story-UPQLAFEqirhGjnEQoaIEaP.html
21-05-2020||City||Accidents between Delhi, UP killed 28 migrant workers in 1 month||At least 32 accidents involving speeding vehicles hitting migrant labourers returning to their homes from the national capital to Uttar Pradesh alone left 28 people dead from April 15 to May 15, according to Delhi traffic police and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) data.The Delhi traffic police’s control room received 12 calls about such accidents while NHAI’s highway patrolling teams recorded 20 such mishaps even as some of them were not fatal.“The number of migrant workers that have met with accidents while walking back home could be higher. These are just those that have come to the notice of our patrolling teams,” said an NHAI official on the condition of anonymity. The official said the migrant workers are at a greater risk of being hit by speeding vehicles along dimly-lit highways. Officials said NHAI has increased the presence of its patrolling teams along these routes to ensure accidents are prevented as the pedestrian movement has increased. Many workers prefer to walk or cycle after sundown as the mercury has begun to hover over 40 degrees Celsius. Some of them tend to sleep without realising the risks of speeding vehicles. “In Delhi, our PCR [police control room] vehicles are doing rounds of the city through the night and anyone found sleeping on roadsides and at risk is taken to shelter homes to ensure their safety,” said Delhi police spokesman MS Randhawa.Migrant workers left jobless by the lockdown imposed in late March to check the Covid-19 spread have continued walking and cycling back to their homes from big cities like Delhi even as buses in late April and special trains have been arranged for them since May 1. Some workers have been unable to get tickets for these trains since they do not have identity documents while several states have also been unable to arrange enough trains to take them home. Scores of home-bound migrant workers have died in accidents across the country.The Delhi traffic police said a migrant worker died a day after a speeding car hit two migrants cycling back to their homes along the Delhi-Meerut expressway near Delhi’s Commonwealth Games Village on May 2. A 26-year-old worker was injured in a similar incident on April 28 near Patparganj. At least two accidents have been reported from highways in Uttar Pradesh after May 15. Around 24 migrant workers trying to return home were killed when two lorries crashed into each other in Uttar Pradesh’s Auraiya district on Saturday.Three women were killed and a dozen were injured on Monday when a truck carrying 17 migrant workers, who had walked from Delhi to Harpalpur and then boarded this vehicle, overturned along the Jhansi-Mirzapur highway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/accidents-between-delhi-up-killed-28-migrant-workers-in-1-month/story-Ci4qfCuwBOVJLrrnT2MqBL.html
21-05-2020||Noida||Migrants from states other than Bihar and UP lose hope of going home||Sita Koshley and her father Sukhchain Koshley, part of a group of around 22 labourers from Mungeli, Chhattisgarh, have never felt so betrayed in their lives. Fetched by a contractor in February to work at a construction site in Delhi, the group decided to walk back home after their rations got over in the days following the lockdown announcement. The man who lured them to Delhi for a daily wage of ₹350 per person had fled without paying them.The group, like many others, were stopped at the Delhi-Noida border and the police brought them to the Sector 19 shelter home on May 16, where after were asked to wait for their turn to go home.“We had been waiting for the past four days and whenever we ask officials when our turn will come, they tell us to wait. We requested them to allow us to walk back home. Yes, we get food here, and a place to sleep, but after all that has happened to us, we simply want to go back home,” Sita said. Like the rest of her group, she used to work at a construction site called ‘Janpath hotel’ and the contractor had fled without paying them. They had no choice but to walk back home.The migrants in the group said they received an allowance of ₹1,000 each in March and till April, they also received weekly rations.However, after that the man who brought them to Delhi fled and they were left with no food or supplies.“The contractor, Ashok Patel, got us here saying the wages would be good, and so we came. When we asked for our complete wages, he said if he gave us that all the money, we might lose it. Ultimately, he stopped coming to our shanties at the site after the lockdown was extended. We know we will never get our pending wages, but at least let us go home,” Sukhchain said.While the district administration has arranged transport for a number of migrant workers of Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh, arrangements for other states are still unclear. While the city saw around 84,000 registrations for Shramik Special trains, more migrants continued to reach Noida from Delhi and elsewhere.Several people from Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand who attempted to walk home from Delhi and elsewhere, were stopped at the Delhi-UP border and brought to different shelter homes in Noida.Rajmani Patel, along with his friends, Aman Patel and Himanshu Joshi who hail from Rewa in Madhya Pradesh were also stopped on the Delhi-Noida Expressway after walking from Zirakhour, Mohali district, Punjab. “We used to work at an e-commerce platform that sold clothes and accessories. Since online shopping stopped and ours’ was a commission-based earning, we had nothing to do but to leave. The landlord was also pressuring us to leave. We walked till Noida, but are now stuck with nothing but abuses from police and khichdi to eat for the past three days,” Rajmani said. “We understand that those from Bihar and UP are being given preference, so we requested officials to sent us till Prayagraj, from where we can take a taxi to Rewa. But they didn’t agree to that either,’ said Himanshu Joshi.Jasmatiya Devi, Satnarayan Bhagat and Kalicharan Narua from a village in Lohardaga district in Jharkhand were among hundreds living at the congested Noida authority’s shelter home. Workers at a steel workshop at Nangloi, Delhi, these migrants decided to walk to home from Delhi, but were bought to the shelter home and asked to wait.“Our maalik (shop owner) did not pay us a single penny, nor did he give us ration. They don’t care if we live or die. All our savings were coming to an end and the meals being distributed at the schools by government were not enough. What other option did we had other than walking?” Bhagat said.According to officials, the administration is working on arranging transport for the migrants other than Bihar and UP as well.“We are reviewing the situation, and registrations are also being received online from the workers who are from Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere. We are working on arranging transport from them very soon,” MN Upadhyay, additional divisional magistrate (finance), Gautam Budh Nagar, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/migrants-from-states-other-than-bihar-and-up-lose-hope-of-going-home/story-bVVKTev9GOrajofo4UYpEL.html
21-05-2020||Noida||BJP-Congress lock horns on sending migrants home, 4 Cong leaders booked||Noida police on Wednesday said it has filed FIRs against four Congress leaders and several unknown people for unlawful assembly and not wearing masks under Sections 144, 188, 269 and 270 of Indian Penal Code. Police said Congress’ Uttar Pradesh general secretary Virendra Singh Guddu, state vice-president Pankaj Malik, Noida city’s president Mohammad Shahbuddin, Delhi state Congress president Anil Chaudhary, along with several other workers, have been booked for not wearing masks and engaging in unlawful assembly near Noida-Delhi border’s Kalindi Kunj Barrage site. Congress leaders, however, said that they were booked when they were arranging buses for poor migrant workers, who are forced to walk to their respective hometowns, risking everything. “The accused were found breaking the law, violating section 144 and other sections imposed by Gautam Budh Nagar administration in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. We cannot allow lawlessness and violation of law like that as it can be a threat to peace in the area,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police.Miffed with police action Congress workers later staged a brief protest against the UP government in front of Sector 19 Noida city magistrate’s office, where they shouted slogans against the police.“Congress party and our senior leader Priyanka Gandhi’s intention is to help the migrant workers, who are walking to their hometowns because the Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state is not providing them adequate transport facilities. We have requested the UP government to put BJP’s flag above buses if they so want but to let the migrants use them because we cannot allow migrants to risk everything like this. The BJP must forget political differences ,” said Virendra Singh Guddu UP Congress general secretary.The BJP, however, rebutted the allegations made by Congress workers.“All allegations of Congress are false and politically motivated with regard to action against them and on providing buses. Congress does not want to help needy. They only want to milk political gains in the name of helping migrants. This is very sad and they should stop this immediately,” said Dhirendra Singh BJP MLA from Jewar and senior BJP leader.The Uttar Pradesh government however said that had chalked out a detailed plan and were in the process of sending migrants back to their home towns safely via trains and buses.“We have sent 52,000 migrants, including students and workers, back to their hometowns so far via trains. We allow them to register on our helpline and then send them the next day. This work will continue until all the migrants are sent, home” said Narendra Bhooshan, nodal officer of the operation to send migrants in Delhi to UP cities. Similarly the Gautam Budh Nagar administration is also sending migrants to Eastern UP cities via buses and trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/bjp-congress-lock-horns-on-sending-migrants-home-4-cong-leaders-booked/story-av5KeLBOcp3dORBOuYni7M.html

21-05-2020||Chandigarh||Covid outbreak in Bapu Dham Colony shows utter failure of Chandigarh administration, says BJP councillor||While Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) city chief Arun Sood defended the UT administration’s performance in containing the spread of the coronavirus, his fellow party man and BJP councilor from Bapu Dham, Dalip Sharma, on Wednesday criticised the administration’s handling of the spread in his constituency.Bapu Dham Colony has become the epicenter of the pandemic in the city with 131 cases so far.“Since the first case returned positive on April 24, the administration failed to take appropriate steps in controlling the spread. Every family where the case was reported should have been put in an institutional quarantine. But they waited for other family members and then neighbours to get infected,” said Sharma.“There are government schools where these families can be isolated so that their neighbours or other people in the locality are not infected. The administration should also step up testing here,” added Sharma.Expressing surprise at Sharma’s outburst, Sood said, “Earlier Sharma has been consistently expressing satisfaction at the performance of local administration including the SDM concerned.”“Even if there are any loopholes in the administration’s handling of the situation, these are unintentional. If the administration has followed all the central guidelines then its okay. It has successfully limited the covid-19 spread to particularly localities rather than the entire city,” Sood added.But he backed Sharma on keeping people under institutional quarantine.Former BJP MP and member of the BJP national executive committee Satya Pal Jain came out in support of Sharma. Jain urged the administration to take the local councilor into confidence while formulating schemes about the Bapu Dham Colony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/situation-in-bapu-dham-colony-shows-utter-failure-of-chandigarh-administration-says-bjp-councillor/story-ed9zByy2vkKjCtm6tWXdJK.html
21-05-2020||City||Ludhiana: Committee formed to look into arhtiyas’ demand of opening city mandi for six days a week||Ludhiana deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal has formed a three-member committee to look into the arhtiyas’ (commission agents) demand of opening the city sabzi mandi six days a week. The move comes after market committee officials approached DC Agrawal on Wednesday. The committee members include sub-divisional magistrate (SDM, west) Amrinder Singh Malhi, additional deputy commissioner of police-1 (ADCP) Gurpreet Singh Sikand and district mandi officer (DMO) Jaswinder Dhaliwal. DC Agrawal said, “The committee members will look into the demands and submit a plan, detailing the measures to be taken for managing gathering in the mandi.” Following the complaints of crowding at the sabzi mandi near Jalandhar bypass, the administration had, on April 3, restricted the sale of vegetables and fruits in the mandi to three days—Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Only listed suppliers, who sell vegetables to street vendors in the city’s 95 wards, were issued passes to enter the market.Ruing losses due to decline in sales, the arhtiyas have demanded that the mandi be opened for six days a week. They also demanded that customers, other than vendors, should also be allowed in the mandi. Ludhiana Sabzi Mandi Arhtiya Association president Gurkamal Singh said that arhtiyas have been facing losses as vendors listed with the market committee purchase vegetables only from a select arhtiyas, as they illegally buy vegetables from other markets situated outside the city. “Arhtiyas also face losses as perishable items rot due to a gap of a day. They are ready to take all required precautions, but the administration should open the mandi for six days a week,” added Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-committee-formed-to-look-into-arhtiyas-demand-of-opening-of-mandi-six-days-in-week/story-9IiYl36InH3zb4ErijW9EP.html
21-05-2020||Pune||PCMC out of red zone, decision on new guidelines by May 22||The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has been excluded as a red zone by the government of Maharashtra, for the fourth phase of the lockdown.PCMC has reported seven deaths and 242 Covid-19 (coronavirus) positive cases as of May 20.“The new guidelines will come into effect from May 22 and will continue until May 31, though the details are still being worked out,” said Shravan Hardikar, PCMC commissioner, adding, “We are still figuring out on how to execute the order. There could be certain restrictions which we will announce after consulting with the government.”He further added that shops will be open for business, but there will be restrictions in the market areas.“It will all depend upon how people behave and follow the government guidelines. We are giving a slight liberty to the people in PCMC, for they followed the earlier restrictions well, but that does not mean the Coronavirus is gone. If there is even an increase in the cases again, we will have to rethink the freedom offered. We will have to be vigilant , follow social distancing and have stringent hand hygiene to keep the twin cities free of further cases,” Hardikar said.Last week, PCMC allowed for 33 per cent of employees of each company in the urban township to return to work.“We intend to extend it a bit, but only with the concurrence of the government. There is still a ban on travel from a red zone and we are thinking of allowing limited public transport if things go well; but the night curfew will continue and essential goods supply will also continue, but restaurants, malls, salons, schools and colleges will remain closed.”Meanwhile, no housemaids are allowed in housing societies in the PCMC area, as most live in containment zones. “Definitely there will be a rethink on May 31. What we plan is that every resident will be responsible for their maid and we are going to ask every resident to fetch the maid from the gate after proper sanitisation and again drop them at the gate after work, so that contact tracing can be done in case something untoward happens,” said Kiran Wadgma, Palash Society, Wakad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pcmc-out-of-red-zone-decision-on-new-guidelines-by-may-22/story-kcxwmKMPpxXpYLeZZVVQlJ.html

21-05-2020||Pune||Businesses reopen in Pune under safety cover after 2 months||After two months of lockdown, Laxmi road, Bajirao road, Tilak road and Jungli Maharaj road sprung back to life after non-essential shop owners reopened their businesses on Wednesday.The staff at these shops were seen cleaning, checking stock and even attending to customers after Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad issued fresh guidelines on Tuesday.Shop owners have now been allowed to open their businesses on certain days of the week. The civic chief has granted permission to owners dealing in jewellery, electronics, mobiles, stationery, automobile parts, home appliances, utensils and others to reopen shops in non-containment zones.Yogendra Ashtekar, owner of Ashtekar jewellers shop, said, “We reopened our shop after 65 days. We are following the rules and regulations laid by authorities. Customers are sanitised.”The owner of DK Traders, Dhiraj Parmar, a cloth shop on Laxmi road said, “The first thing we did after reopening the shop is cleaning and checking stocks. We are following social distancing norms. The main problem we face now is that all our workers have gone back to their villages.”Nitesh Chopda, owner of Nataraj cloth shop, demanded more clarity from PMC on guidelines.“There is confusion in the order given by PMC. Most of us have reopened the shops, but there are specific days given by the civic body regarding category of shops. It’s all confusing as of now,” he said.Mahendra Bora, another shop owner, said, “The lockdown has impacted 40 to 50 per cent of businesses. We have paid staff salaries and most of them who have returned to hometowns are unwilling to return this year. Without staff, it is going to be difficult to run shops.”On Jungli Maharaj road and Fergusson college road, several non-essential shops of electronics, cloth, women accessories and food items reopened. People were seen walking on these areas during daytime, taking home food parcel from prominent hotels like Goodluck café.Kiran Pisal, who had come to get food parcel, said, “It’s good that relaxation has been implemented in non-red zones, but we should follow social distancing and other health safety norms.”In Pimpri-Chinchwad, businesses are allowed to remain open, apart from industries in rural and urban areas, private construction sites, private offices, government offices and I-T companies. The supply of essential and non-essential goods, courier and postal services, food home delivery in non-red zones has been allowed.A picture of relaxation was seen at several non-containment zones in the PCMC area like Tanajinagar, Akurdi road, Ajmera colony, Pradhikaran, Chinchwadgaon, and in some parts of Pimpri. Most of the non-essential shops were seen open and citizens bought goods with proper social distancing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/businesses-reopen-after-two-months-of-shutdown/story-WBvCbhNAwUgVIPxEWDwo6N.html

She was admitted to the hospital a few days ago after she tested positive. So given that her condition was serious, as she also suffered from breathlessness and a cough, we shifted her to the ICU,” said Dr Gaikwad.Despite stiffness in her joints, the woman danced with a walking stick in hand, much to the amazement of staff at the hospital.The woman spent 12 days at the hospital before being recovering and returning home. “After getting to know that she is going home and that het second test was negative, she was very happy and began dancing.

21-05-2020||City||Police volunteer caught extorting money from commuter in Ludhiana||A Ludhiana police volunteer was caught taking ₹1,000 from a youth in exchange of releasing his vehicle documents on Wednesday.The volunteer had seized the bike documents of a commuter, Sooraj Kumar, on Tuesday, after threatening to issue a challan during checking at Shivpuri Chowk. On Wednesday, when the accused called Sooraj to a tea stall near Shivpuri Chowk, the latter reported the matter to senior traffic marshal Amarjit Singh Bhatti, under whom the volunteer was working.Later, Bhatti along with other social activists reached the spot and caught the volunteer red-handed accepting the cash and returning the motorcycle documents to the complainant.Bhatti said that the volunteer had joined city police curfew enforcement team around a month and a half ago. “He was removed from volunteer service after we caught him red handed making the exchange,” the senior traffic marshal said, adding that ID-card and uniform issued to the volunteer by the police were also taken back from him.Assistant commissioner of police (ACP, traffic) Gurdev Singh, nodal officer of the volunteer, said the matter has come to his notice. “We are verifying the facts before taking further action,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-volunteer-caught-extorting-money-from-commuter-in-ludhiana/story-BaeqBBgrPG2uMf1GVq97cM.html
21-05-2020||Pune||Pune domestic helpers resume work with safety restrictions||In phase 4.0 of the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection, some housing societies have partially allowed house helps from non-containment zones to return to work.Amid apprehensions, Lata Salunke, who works as a domestic help at Kohinoor society, off Spicer College road, went to work on Wednesday. “I have been calling my employers for the past 20 days to resume work. They paid my salary until April, but May was getting a bit difficult,” she said.“Ours is a joint family and two among us work as maids. While I got a call to resume work, my sister-in-law is awaiting a positive reply from her employer,” said Salunke.“When I entered the bungalow society, the security staff checked me for fever before asking me whether I was carrying gloves and requested that I wear mask at all times while I was in my employee’s home. I was also informed that the garbage collected should be thrown inside the bin kept at the house. I sweep and clean the house, but it becomes difficult to work wearing gloves,” she said.Her sister-in-law Sunita Salunkhe sits outside their small home, cleaning utensils, eagerly waiting for her employer’s call. “My employee has paid my salary till May, but I need to work. I used to work at three houses in the same building, but owners of two houses called to say that they do not need my services.”The situation is almost similar in many of the housing societies in the city, where some domestic helpers from non-containment zones have rejoined work, but follow strict regulations.“We have started allowing domestic helps at our society from May 18. Apart from thermal screening and use of sanitiser at entrances, we have insisted that it is compulsory to wear mask at society premises. They cannot loiter, but visit houses and leave the residential premises once the work is over,” said Maithily Manakwad, a resident of NIBM road.“Maids have been given passes. They are not allowed to chew tobacco and spit. The public toilets have been acid-washed and marked for men and women,” Manakwad said.Meanwhile, in Padmavilas society, off Baner-Pashan link road, the society has allowed services of domestic help in houses of senior citizens and nuclear families which have children.“We had three to four domestic helpers who work in our society as almost 50 per cent of them have left for their hometowns. We have requested them to share their details like their address, number of people in their house, mode of transport among others,” said Rajendra Chuttar, chairman, Padmavilas society.Saroj Agarwal, a senior citizen and a resident of Baner-Pashan link road, has called her domestic help who lives nearby in the quarters provided by the builder. “We have provided our domestic helper and their entire family medicine and masks. She only cleans the house and follows the social distancing norms,” said Agarwal.Nirgunabai, who was working as a domestic helper and leaving for Beed tonight (Wednesday), said, “I wasn’t getting any work here, so I thought to return home and help my family in farming.”As many as 275 members in Aathashri Pashan have 38 domestic helpers who have been provided with accommodation and food. “We arranged for six women to stay within our complex 24-hours. They provided services as substitutes throughout the lockdown period. We, therefore, did not find it difficult. Also, we have senior citizens need round-the-clock helpers. We sanitise the entire complex twice a week,” said Hari Sundaresh, president of Athashri Pashan, on Baner-Pashan link road.“We do not plan to bring anyone from outside till the lockdown ends on May 31,” said Sundaresh.According to Sachin Vijay Khandelwal, a resident of Karan Celista, Sopan Baug, they are awaiting clarity from the civic body on maids resuming work. “We have not yet allowed domestic helpers to resume work in society. Most of the senior citizens residing in the society, except one or two, do not want services of domestic help as of now. If we get a circular from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), which specifies areas of containment and non-containment zones, accordingly we will take a call,” said Khandelwal.Residential societies set guidelines for domestic helps  Lack of clarity from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on maids has left many residential societies to set their own rules and regulations.Santosh Krishna, a resident of Wagholi, said, “I think the civic body has left the decision to housing societies to allow domestic helpers to resume work. A formal order from resident welfare associations or local governing body would have made things clear.”“We are taking a very protective approach because of the virus spread and will take a call later,” said Krishna.Several housing societies held online meetings to draft policies regarding maids and other domestic helpers. “At Sahil Sarene, we are also keeping PMC in the loop via online,” said Ameya Karambelkar a resident of Baner.While some felt that the onus of safety of its residents lies with the management, but lack of clarity on the issue is making it difficult to take a decision. “There are genuine requests for maids from senior citizens, patients, pregnant women, nursing mothers and working women. So, clarity from authorities on the issue in a must,” said Mehzabin Saiyed, secretary, Nyati Empire, Kharadi.“The domestic helpers in our society are not coming as of now. While some members of the society want to call back their maids, others are against because of health reasons” said Nitin Memane, a resident of Gera Emerald City North, Kharadi, adding that members are paying maids at least half salary.In Balewadi, some societies are collecting personal details of maids and ensuring that they belong from green zone. Other criteria include the helpers should either walk to work or use their personal vehicle (no public transport), should have stayed in Pune address for 15 days and should not be unwell.“We have advised people to start with one domestic helper, but many members are hesitant to call them,” said Sangeeta Baheti, a resident of Balewadi.Nandan Prospera, a residential society in Baner, has allowed a few domestic helpers to resume work from June 1, but only to houses that genuinely need their services. The housing committee has made resident employers responsible for ensuring that the maids follow all preventive criteria set by the government. The domestic helps will be issued an ID card only after the health safety measures are met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/domestic-helpers-resume-work-with-safety-restrictions/story-DT2wNxvhhj7ftg79h45dyO.html

21-05-2020||Chandigarh||Delhi HC directs jail authorities to take 1984 riots convict for medical check up||The Delhi high court has directed the jail authorities to take one of the convicts in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case to ILBS Hospital within three days for medical check up as he has to undergo a liver and kidney transplant.A bench of justices Manmohan and Sanjeev Narula, who conducted the hearing through video conferencing, also directed the Delhi government and SIT to file their status reports by May 25 on convict Naresh Sehrawat’s plea seeking suspension of his sentence for three months on medical grounds.The court was hearing a plea by Sehrawat, who is serving life imprisonment in the riots case, seeking interim suspension of sentence for three months on grounds of needing a simultaneous liver and kidney transplant.The plea said though his appointment with the doctor at Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) Hospital here was fixed for March 11, he was not taken there by the jail authorities as his transportation was considered highly risky due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The court issued notice on the application to Delhi government, represented through advocate Kamra Vohra, and Special Investigation Team (SIT), represented through advocate Tarannum Cheema.“The jail authority is directed to ensure that the appellant (Sehrawat) is taken to ILBS Hospital within next three days for medical check up and treatment. The respondents (authorities) are directed to file their status reports on or before May 25,” the court said and listed the matter for further hearing on May 26.An SIT was earlier set up by the Ministry of Home Affairs to reinvestigate the riot cases.The trial court had awarded death penalty to convict Yashpal Singh and life term to Naresh Sehrawat in the case relating to the killing of two men in New Delhi during the 1984 riots - the first convictions in the cases reopened by the SIT.Sherawat has also appealed against his conviction and the sentence before the high court, which is pending.The death reference as well as appeal of Singh against the capital punishment awarded to him is also pending in the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/delhi-hc-directs-jail-authorities-to-take-1984-riots-convict-for-medical-check-up/story-syOQXLT8MwcmKuCiVbgA4O.html
21-05-2020||Chandigarh||48 people discharged in Chandigarh, five fresh cases from Bapu Dham||As many as 48 Covid-19 patients were discharged from the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) on Wednesday, taking the number of recoveries in Chandigarh to 139, even as five new cases surfaced at the Bapu Dham Colony containment zone. Now, the total number of confirmed cases stands at 205, of which only 63 are active. Three people have died so far.The development comes a day after 37 people recovered in the city. With this, the city has seen 85 recoveries in two days, and the recovery rate has shot up to 68%. Meanwhile, the fresh cases pertain to two men, aged 25 and 50, a woman, aged 28, and two children, a four-year-old boy and six-year-old girl. They were contacts of previous cases reported in Bapu Dham Colony, which accounts for 65% of Chandigarh’s confirmed cases.Even as the UT health department claimed only 45 recoveries — all from Bapu Dham Colony, the PGIMER release mentioned three more people — two females, aged 16 and 50, and one 10-year-old boy, also from the same colony — who were discharged upon two consecutive negative tests.The remaining 45 have been declared recovered a day after the UT administration asked the PGIMER to adhere to the new Covid-19 discharge policy for asymptomatic patients.According to the new guidelines issued by the Union health ministry, asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and very mild symptomatic cases can be discharged from isolation health facility without testing provided they had been asymptomatic (no fever, breathlessness) for more than three days.All these 45 patients completed over two weeks’ quarantine at the PGIMER, but remained asymptomatic, and were thus eligible for discharge, confirmed a PGIMER official. However, they will have to remain in seven-day quarantine at Sood Dharamshala, Sector 22, considering the fact that further isolation may not be a possible in their congested dwellings in Bapu Dham.UT health secretary Arun Gupta said necessary arrangements have been made for their stay. “A part of the dharamshala is functional as a Covid care centre and we have medical staff posted there for any emergency,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-new-covid-19-cases-in-chandigarh-take-total-count-to-202/story-0Ijqngws2RIhyyCqzhtDTO.html
