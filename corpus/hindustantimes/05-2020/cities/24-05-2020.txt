WII’s study will span 18 months, with data collection over three seasons. The corridor connects Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary in Kolhapur in Maharashtra to Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka. The corridor is currently threatened by mining projects.The state chief wildlife warden said the total grant for the proposal was ₹83 lakh, and the study is expected to commence soon. “We have recently issued the final sanction for this project wherein WII will be identifying the potential corridors for the movement of elephants and tigers in this region,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra. “Though the project was proposed in December 2018, issues related to funding, expanding the scope of work, and sanctioning the revised proposal led to the delay. Of the ₹83 lakh, we have already paid ₹58 lakh for the project. The recruitment process is underway but due to the lockdown, there are some more delays,” he said.Bilal Habib, scientist, WII said the project is expected to begin by May-end. “We will be deputing two scientists. They will map the corridor and check whether villages in these two talukas are falling within the corridor or not, and thus whether they need to be declared as a part of the ESA. We will also be assessing the human disturbances to this corridor,” he said.The approval comes at a time when environmentalists are upset with the state for leaving out the entire Dodamarg taluka and nine of 13 villages from Sawantwadi taluka from the final Western Ghats ESA declaration.The 2013 HC order was based on a petition by Awaaz Foundation. “The current pandemic, which arose from the unnatural proximity of humans with wildlife as a direct consequence of the destruction of forests, is a testimony for the need to preserve our natural areas,” said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation.Another petition by environment group Vanashakti from 2016 seeking enforcement of the previous order across the entire Sawantwadi taluka led to an order by the HC declaring the entire belt as a ‘no tree felling zone’. However, a 2019 study by Vanashakti, using satellite maps, recorded the destruction of forests across 1,600 acres at 103 locations in the corridor.“Such studies [WII’s latest proposal] serve very little purpose in areas where a recorded history of wildlife exists and the forest department is paying compensation to locals due to wildlife-related damages. This expensive academic study will be futile as all evidence is already available,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti. Both petitions highlighted that the corridor is home to tigers, leopards, elephants, sloth bears, civets, pangolins, several resident and migratory bird species, and even the Indian giant squirrel, Maharashtra’s state animal. The forest department confirmed that over the past five years, transient movement of close to 25 tigers has been observed at the corridor while an elephant family of five resides there.WHY THE FORESTS ARE IMPORTANT?The Dodamarg-Sawantwadi belt lies in the heart of the biodiversity hotspot, the Western GhatsThe area is a source of perennial water bodiesIt is an integral part of the Sahyadri-Konkan wildlife corridor through which several wild animals such as the Asiatic elephant and the critically endangered tiger moveIt is also home to the endemic Malabar giant squirrel, and globally-threatened species of flora and fauna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-nod-for-83-lakh-plan-to-study-tiger-corridors-in-dodamarg-sawantwadi-belt/story-SNSpvY0Itk6fx4i9PCvqOO.html

Later, upon investigation, we found from her family members that her husband and in-laws behaved badly with her as she could not get pregnant even three years after her marriage. The in-laws allegedly also demanded more dowry because of the same reason.”After collecting evidences and statements of more than 15 people including her family members and neighbours, Bhiwandi City police registered a case against three people — her 29-year-old husband, and her parent-in-laws who are 58 and 52 years of age — under sections 304B (dowry death) and 498 (detaining with criminal intent a married woman) of the Indian Penal Code.In a similar case, a 36-year-old woman took her own life on April 27 in Chitalsar area of Thane.

24-05-2020||Mumbai||Excluding villages from new Western Ghats ESA proposal, opening them up for mining, industries to be disastrous for environment: RS MP||The Maharashtra government’s proposal to exclude previously identified villages in its final Western Ghats eco-sensitive area (ESA) notification and open them up for industrial and mining activities has received objections from Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament (MP) Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje.Calling for a ban on mining activities across Kolhapur and the Sahyadri range in the ghats, the MP had on May 21 written to chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar to reconsider the setting up red category industries in ESAs in the region, which includes a tiger reserve.“I request you to ensure that grant of permission for increase industrialisation, mining, and infrastructure development in ESA’s of Kolhapur in particular and Sahyadri Western Ghats is shelved. Both Madhav Gadgil and committee chaired by K Kasturirangan warned against the destruction of the Western Ghats,” read Raje’s letter.While speaking to HT, Raje, the heir to the Kolhapur royal family and a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, said that opening up areas for mining and industries will destroy its ecological value and expose its nearby zones to natural disasters. “The entire Western Ghats holds historical significance, with the Kolhapur and Sahyadri range having huge heritage value from the time of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. It needs to be protected and preserved as a World Heritage Site as designated by the United Nations. The state should support green and sustainable industries such as solar and wind, give employment to local communities and refrain from environmentally damaging proposals,” he said.Meanwhile, state forest minister Sanjay Rathod said that the final deliberations on the proposal were still underway.“We have studied specific details of the proposal and the environment ministry is yet to give the final nod. A report will be submitted to the CM’s office soon based on follow up meetings we have had. Final discussions on the subject will take place in the coming days based on the CM’s suggestions on the report,” said Rathod.On Thursday, the state had proposed the inclusion of 2,092 of 2,133 villages or 15,359 sq km of the originally proposed 17,340 sq km, thereby excluding 11.4% area from the draft Western Ghats ESA, and leaving out crucial wildlife corridors, buffer areas of tiger reserves and sanctuaries. The state proposed exclusion of 17 villages for industrial activities and 13 for mining based on suggestions from the industries department and mining bodies.The Savarde village, which lies in the core zone of the Radhanagri Wildlife Sanctuary in Kolhapur, the Maloshi and Bamnoli villages in Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary in Satara, and the Yelan Gai village which was earlier marked as a mining village in the buffer area of the Sahayadri Tiger Reserve, are some of the villages that have been excluded.Raje said that last year in August, 56 people died owing to floods in western Maharashtra, while 4.09 lakh people were affected across 386 villages in Kolhapur district alone. “If ecological destruction is allowed to continue, such catastrophes will only increase,” said the MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/excluding-villages-from-new-western-ghats-esa-proposal-opening-them-up-for-mining-industries-to-be-disastrous-for-environment-rs-mp/story-E0HXkpNKnbprpofb04qrOO.html

24-05-2020||City||12 flights to resume from Patna airport today||PATNA: After almost two months of suspension of air operations due to Covid-19 induced lockdown, 12 flights from Patna’s Jay Prakash Narayan International Airport will be operational from Monday.Indigo , Spice Jet and Air India will be resuming their flights from Patna Airport to Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore.In total 16 flight landings and take offs have been permitted to operate from May 25. However, GoAir has not started the booking as it is seeking clarifications from states about the readiness of airports with regard to arrival of flights and the guidelines for passengers entering their respective states.“On receiving clarity, GoAir wll open its site for booking from May 25 till May 31,” a statement from the private airline said.More importantly, the uncertainty over flights coming from Mumbai to Patna got a bit clear on Sunday evening after the Maharashtra government allowed 25 landings and take offs from the commercial capital city after much deliberations on the issue due to the rise in number of Covid-19 cases in the state. The first flight to arrive Patna on Monday would be from Mumbai. “ The Indigo flight would reach here in the morning. There is no information of any re scheduling,” said a senior officer of the airline.Patna airport director BCH Negi said that arrangements have been made for handling any symptomatic passenger. “ There is no quarantine requirement for passengers arriving to Patna. All passengers would undergo temperature check before entering the terminal and also thermal screening would be done of passengers on arrival. Emphasis is on contactless travel, maintaining social distance and sanitisation. All airlines have prepared their staff for following the new guidelines issued by the ministry of civil aviation.” On Sunday, the Patna airport authorities and district administration officials made inspections for resumption of air travel. The passengers will have to arrive four hours before the flight and baggage checking counters of all airlines will be closed one hour before the flight departure . It will be mandatory for the passengers to have Aarogya Setu app downloaded in their mobile phones and masks, gloves are mandatory. Patna divisional commissioner Sanjay Agarwal has given detailed instructions to the airport director BCH Negi to ensure that social distancing norms are followed. “ The air ticket of passengers would be treated as a vehicle pass from their homes to the airport. Besides, there will be adequate number of cabs, e-rickshaws , autos at the airport premises for ferrying passengers back home,” said Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/12-flights-to-resume-from-patna-airport-today/story-MMdYqHRntO9CMckoLvn9ML.html
24-05-2020||Delhi||Not much to celebrate for residents of shelter homes, red zones||For stranded migrant workers and people living in containment zones, Eid preparations have been limited to making do with essentials as the lockdown to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic has dampened the fervour of the festival.Some migrants are dependent on government and NGOs for food to observe the festive traditions, while others have borrowed money from friends and relatives to buy sweetmeats.Mohammad Yusuf, 32, resident of a shelter home in central Delhi, who could not register for a Shramik Special train, said that this would be the first time that he is not celebrating Eid at home. “Every year, I would get my children new clothes and gifts for the festival. They have been waiting for me to reach home, but my registration has still not been done. What does the festival mean without family and friends? Here, we get some food to live by. I have run out of money to get them anything at all when I do go back,” said Yusuf, who used to work at a toy-making unit in Sadar Bazar.He had left his rented room to head back to his village in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur and when he could not get on a bus, was brought to the shelter by civil defence volunteers.According to the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) officials, the number of migrants at the shelters has reduced to just about 10-15% since the Shramik Special trains started on May 1. “The NGOs roped in to run the shelters have been providing a basket of fruit and cold drinks for ‘iftar’, for those fasting during Ramzan. They will also be distributing sweets and dry snacks on Eid, on Monday,” said a senior DUSIB official, on the condition of anonymity.The official said that the DUSIB runs 223 permanent shelters for the homeless, while the Delhi government had converted 256 school buildings to house migrants.Among those stranded, at south Delhi’s Shahpur Jat, is a group of around 1,000 hand embroidery from West Bengal. “Earlier, we were waiting for our turn for train registration and now, the trains have been cancelled because of the cyclone. There is no money to even buy fruits or milk for children. Every year, we would buy new clothes, but this is the first time that there is no such thing for Eid. We make do with rice and lentils every day,” said Mafizul Mallick, of the group.Abdul Salaam, the president, Centre for Holistic Development, an NGO working for the homeless, said, “People have been out of work and have run out of savings. They had hoped to return home, but have been stuck. We will be distributing ‘sevaiyan’ (a vermicelli-based dessert) and food for the workers here so that they at least have something to celebrate.”In Delhi’s 87 containment zones, especially in central, east, northeast and south-east districts that house a sizeable Muslim population, the festivities will be limited to the households.Prominent markets at Sadar Bazar, Nabi Karim, Chandni Mahal and Bara Hindu Rao, which are generally abuzz with activity during Ramzan, have been deserted this year.Anwar Ullah, general secretary Chandni Mahal residents’ welfare association, said, “The lanes are empty, there is no sound. It doesn’t feel like its Eid tomorrow. The sweets shops have not been opened. We have got ‘sevaiyan’ to cook but don’t know if other snacks will be available tomorrow. It has been really tough on the children.”Nizamuddin Basti, located just behind the Hazrat Nizamuddin dargah, which used to be a hub of activity during the festival has been locked down for almost two months, after the Tablighi Jamaat-related cases emerged. Abdur Rahman, general secretary of the Basti’s RWA, said, “There are not even enough lights put up for decorations in a place that dazzled not just during Eid, but throughout the year. The lanes used to be full of people shopping and gathering to exchange greetings in the days leading to the festival. The lockdown has been the longest for us. Even though there has been no new positive case, the area has not been opened. We have procured food and other decorative material for houses from Bhogal. That is all we can do now.”Ali Rehman, 32, who owns a garments store in Vivek Vihar, which is part of a containment zone, said there is little to celebrate due to the losses suffered during the lockdown. “For small-scale businessmen, there has been no reprieve. Many people have lost their jobs. I have never seen such calm around the festival. Since we cannot go even to the masjids, which have been closed, or to relatives’ houses, we will just cook and pray at home,” he said.In southeast Delhi’s Zakir Nagar, home to a large number of Muslims, Irshad Alam, who owns a footwear store, said that the usual fervour is missing due to safety concerns on people’s minds. “Even if one wishes to, there is so much apprehension that one wouldn’t go out to meet their relatives. Being in a confined area, that is not even a prospect. It’s like celebrating Eid inside a prison-like complex,” said Alam.In nearby containment zones of Shaheen Bagh and Okhla too, people said safety is first and that they can celebrate Eid next year once the country emerges from the shadow of this pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/not-much-to-celebrate-for-residents-of-shelter-homes-red-zones/story-WxTbYqm48f0B987wDAzt7O.html

24-05-2020||Patna||Pvt firms failed workers from Bihar: Nitish||Bihar Chief minister Nitish Kumar Sunday accused private sector companies of failing to live up to their responsibility of taking care of people from the state engaged in their factories.During a video conference with migrant workers, serving mandatory quarantine period at government facilities, the CM said, “Private companies, located outside the state, have failed to care of their workers despite their responsibility to do so.”“People have suffered a lot. It is my wish to have adequate work for everyone here. I do not want people to go outside unless there is a compelling reason,” he said during his interaction with the quarantined workers, his third in as many days and his last. Faced with a reverse migration on an unprecedented scale, Kumar sought to reassure returnees of employment. “Opportunities are in place for involving people returning in activities and work suited to their skill profile,” he said. “At least one thing is sure. Nobody dies of hunger in Bihar,” the CM said. He said the textile industry in Munger and Bhagalpur, particularly silk production, has huge potential. “Silk produced here has a worldwide demand. It is time to get down to tap its export potential further and involve more people in ramping up capacities,” he said, asking officials to start working on it.Kumar said industries which could be scaled up, including leather goods, shoes, furniture, bicycles, among others, had a pent-up domestic demand in addition to the locational advantage offered by the consumer state to act as a supplier of surplus production to adjoining states and areas.“We must align our production capabilities with the market need, and efforts must be made to encourage entrepreneurs to set up factories for meeting the demand thrown up by market,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/pvt-firms-failed-workers-from-bihar-nitish/story-kykJicurTrzKUbL8iOrMmJ.html

In a statement here, former minister Daljit Singh Cheema said even though an FIR was registered in this connection on May 11 and paddy breeder seeds of PR-128 and PR-129 were seized from a seed store in Ludhiana, no follow-up action has been taken in the matter till now. “It seems the police have adopted a ‘go slow’ policy and have not made any arrests in the case after it came to light that the breeder seed producer who supplied the seed to the Ludhiana store enjoyed the patronage of cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa,” alleged Cheema. The SAD leader said since the CM held the agriculture portfolio, it was incumbent upon him to pass orders to ensure that the interests of the farming community were not compromised in any manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/break-silence-on-seed-scam-sad-to-punjab-cm/story-K3NczCRZ0wvhFdpEGLYp3K.html

As per the new rules, high-end brands of alcohol can also be sold in departmental stores and supermarkets, as are available in cities like Gurugram. Currently, foreign liquor is sold in retail stores and model shops having licence from the excise department.“We expect that the arrangement may start within the next two months as malls are still closed due to the lockdown. We are waiting for the lockdown to get over and also have to finalise the license fees. Thereafter, we will see how the new arrangement rolls out. The retail vends will not sell all liquors, but only certain categories of foreign liquor. The consumption on the premises of the liquor vend will not be allowed,” said Sanjay R Bhoosreddy, principal secretary of UP excise department.According to officials, the premium retail vends can sell imported liquor brands, Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) brands of scotch or above category, all categories of brandy, gin and wine, besides brands of vodka and rum with MRP more than Rs 700. Such vends can also sell high-end brands of beer with MRP more than Rs 160 per can (of 500ml or equivalent).The liquor vends given licences will give choice and provide access to wide variety of liquor brands both Indian and imported to the consumer besides giving a better shopping experience. “The rules have been framed for allowing sale of premium brands of liquor in malls as there is an increasing trend of shopping in malls. We have malls in Lucknow, Kanpur, and NCR cities like Noida and Ghaziabad, among others, in the state. Licences in form FL-4C will be granted for retail sale of foreign liquor in sealed bottles in malls. So, we are optimistic that the trend of sale of alcohol from liquor vends will pick up,” Bhoosreddy said.According to the new rules, the malls in which such liquor vends can open should have a minimum plinth area of 10,000 square feet, and it includes departmental stores, supermarkets or hybrid supermarkets. Besides, the premium retail vend should have at least 500 square feet carpet area and provide customers the facility to walk in and select the choice of brand from the shelves. Such shops need to be air conditioned with well decorated shelves so that various brands can be displayed under a systematic layout plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/soon-premium-liquor-to-be-sold-at-retail-vends-in-noida-ghaziabad-malls/story-ttwL3doUSBPILQIYqhBVMJ.html

UP-Rera member Balvinder Kumar said all future hearings would be conducted through video conferencing. “From Tuesday onwards, we will start hearing routine cases too. All Rera courts will take up hearing of cases online. Each court will hear 30 cases daily. The list of cases has been prepared,” said Balvinder Kumar on Sunday.“We are briefing the complainants about the procedure of video conferencing. It can be done on mobile phones too if they do not have laptop or desktop facilities. Today, everyone has smart phones. Online video conferencing will not be an issue. This will save time and will be convenient for complainants as well,” said Rajive Kumar, UP-Rera chairman. “As Noida is still under the red zone, the Rera court judges will conduct hearing from their homes. Once the situation improves, video conferencing will be conducted from UP-Rera benches in Greater Noida. At Lucknow, we are conducting video conferencing at UP-Rera office, which is operational,” said Rajive Kumar.UP-Rera Chairman Rajive Kumar said on Sunday, “We started e-courts in March this year. Under this system, all document submissions and replies are being carried out online. Complainants and respondents are called to UP-Rera courts for personal hearing only once during the final arguments. Thereafter, the Rera court issues an order.”“We had planned to hold the final arguments hearing too through video conferencing once the online system was effective and allottees got used to the system. The Covid-19 pandemic has only advanced the process.Originally, we had planned to introduce video conferencing for final arguments after a few months.,”said Chairman.“As we start video conferencing the hearing of routine cases, allottees and builders will soon get used to the new system. In future, we plan to conduct all hearings through video conferencing,” said UP-Rera chairman.On May 18, UP-Rera had conducted final arguments of cases through video conferencing. In 80% of these cases, orders have been passed by Rera court benches. In some cases, the order has been reserved. All these orders will be uploaded once they are typed out and signed,” said Kumar. Advocate Sardar Singh Bansal said, “It will be beneficial for advocates and allottees too. Several complainants are from other states. Advocates should be allowed to participate in the process via video conferencing.” The chairman said advocates are allowed to participate in video conferencing as well. Allottees, builders welcome moveAllottees and builders have welcomed the UP-Rera’s move to conduct all hearings through video conferencing. They hope it will save them time and money.Pankaj Gupta, a resident of Rohini, Delhi, said, “Video conference hearings are beneficial. On May 18, I attended a hearing through video conferencing and saved my time as well as conveyance expenses.”“The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has changed our lifestyle as well as our approach to a lot of things. UP-Rera’s plan of video conferencing is a good decision given the pandemic,” Gupta said.Complainant Karan Khanna, a resident of Meerut, said, “Usually, one spends an entire day just to attend a hearing at the UP-Rera office in Greater Noida. Also, one spends around ₹1,000 on conveyance and food besides the advocate fee. If the video conferencing plan succeeds, then in the future, several complainants may not need to hire an advocate at the office. One can attend the video conference on a mobile phone or a laptop from wherever one is present, either at the home, the office or while travelling in a car.” He said that on May 18, his advocate had represented him in the case via video conferencing.CREDAI (a real estate developers’ association) member and chief managing director, ATS Limited, Getamber Anand said, “It will reduce our advocates’ visits to the UP-Rera office. Video conferencing will be beneficial for all stakeholders.”UP-Rera secretary Abrar Ahmed said, “On Tuesday, 31 cases are listed for Noida’s bench 2 and 30 cases for bench 1.” These will be heard via video conferencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-rera-to-start-hearing-all-cases-through-video-conferencing/story-DiT8ay5ic4yH3dY19ulBrK.html

As per the May 18 orders of the state government, the containment zone in the urban areas will be 250 metre radius or the entire society if a single positive case is reported (category 1). A radius of 500 metre will be sealed if more than two cases are reported (category 2).63 foreign travellers to get discharged The quarantine facilities in GBN are getting empty following the discharge of primary and secondary contacts of positive Covid-19 patients. As per the new guidelines of the state government, only symptomatic people are supposed to be kept under institutional quarantine. Patients from other districts are being discharged and sent back to their home districts where they will have to go under seven days of institutional quarantine followed by seven days of home quarantine. Meanwhile, officials have started the procedure of discharging around 63 foreign travellers who are under institutional quarantine at the Galgotias University in Greater Noida. These people are being sent back to their home districts in vehicles arranged by the GB Nagar administration.On Sunday, a 31-year-old man tried to flee from the Galgotias quarantine centre after he acquired the e-pass to go back to Jharkhand, his home state. The person works in Faridabad and lives in Noida. The man had to catch a train from Dankaur at around 4pm on Sunday and he had requested officials to complete formalities of his discharge. Officials had asked him to wait as the discharge of many other patients was going on. Then the man tried to flee from the centre after his request for the discharge was denied for time being. However, he was noticed by the guards of the Galgotias centre after he managed to exit the centre. The police were informed about the man who immediately brought him back to the centre. “As per the new guidelines, asymptomatic people don’t need to go under institutional quarantine if they have the required facilities at their home. We are in the process of discharging many people who are currently under quarantine at our centre. The man wanted to catch a train and had approached us to get discharged. He was asked to wait and then he tried to flee. He will be discharged soon once the formalities are completed,” said Dr Anil Gupta, in-charge, Galgotias University quarantine centre.Guidelines for offices, industrial units, etcThe district administration has said that following the relaxation in lockdown restrictions in the district, Covid-19 cases may come up in industrial units, commercial outlets, offices and other places. Organizations are asked to inform the health department on immediate basis if any person gets infected with Covid-19 on their premises. The officials have made it clear that the premises can reopen after the sanitisation team gives a ‘premise fitness certificate’. All persons with influenza like illness will have to be compulsorily tested for Covid-19. An undertaking will be taken from the unit or the individual ensuring that the required protocol will be followed by them. Appropriate action will be taken against those organizations and individuals who are found not following the required protocol. The district administration officials are soon going to release a detailed information on the protocols need to be followed by the organizations and concerned individuals. The process of contact tracing will continue as it is.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gb-nagar-six-employees-of-media-group-among-21-new-covid-19-cases/story-gQm9pdlJnqYirCHj2iAOiO.html

24-05-2020||Chandigarh||In a relief, cash-strapped PSPCL to buy cheap power from grid in peak season||In a major relief, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), which has been under financial stress due to low demand in the wake of the coronavirus-induced lockdown, will buy electricity from the grid at rates as economic as Rs 3 per unit and that too during the peak summer season. The price is even lesser than the cost of power generated by the state-owned and private thermal plants in Punjab.The corporation has entered a short-term agreement with the grid to purchase 1,500 megawatt (MW) electricity from June to September, particularly keeping in view the upcoming paddy season.The cost of the Talwandi Sabo Power Plant and independent power plants is around Rs 3.40 per unit against the variable cost of Rs 2.94-Rs 3.04 per unit the corporation will pay to the grid for a unit. “Even as power demand in Punjab is likely to remain on lower side this year due to the prolonged Covid-19 crisis, the corporation’s agreement for power purchase with the grid will come handy in case of an emergency in any power station,” said a senior PSPCL official.“Cheaper power purchased through short-term tenders and power exchange will help replace costly electricity procured though long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) and also reduce the use of imported coal by thermal plants,” he added.PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) Baldev Singh Sran said “Our endeavour is cut the cost of power supply. Usually, the power rates remain high during the peak summers, but this time we got a good deal. The corporation will save Rs 100 crore through the short-term agreement.”“We have placed an order for purchasing 605 MW power (of 1500 MW) from 10 June to 30 June when the demand soars due to paddy sowing. We have made arrangements to provide 8-hour power supply to farmers and round-the-clock uninterrupted power to other consumers,” he added. POWER DEMAND SOARS IN STATEDue to increase in temperatures and consumption of power by agriculture pumpsets for direct sowing of paddy and other crops, power demand in Punjab on Saturday crossed 8,000 MW which was equal to the corresponding day last year. Due to spike in demand, the PSPCL has asked the L&T’s 1,300 MW plant to start power generation. The plant was shut due to less demand of power in the state due to Covid-19 restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-a-relief-cash-strapped-pspcl-to-buy-cheap-power-from-grid-in-peak-season/story-ibb4pqEHgScdp7cJTGsyZK.html
24-05-2020||Gurugram||As mercury soars, power cuts and voltage fluctuations return to haunt residents||With the rapid rise in temperature over the past couple of days, complaints of power cuts and voltage fluctuations in the residential colonies of the city have also increased exponentially. The maximum daytime temperature in the city on Saturday was recorded between 44 and 45 degrees Celsius, compelling the residents to stay inside their homes. On the same day, however, the city’s power distribution company, Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN), recorded more than 1,500 complaints from across the city regarding power cuts and voltage fluctuations.Sushant Lok, Mayfield Gardens, DLF Phase-3, Palam Vihar, New Palam Vihar, sectors 21, 22, 23 and other areas witnessed power cuts at least three to four times during the course of the day.Vishnu Khanna, a resident of Sushant Lok-1, said, “Saturday was particularly terrible as we had power cuts at least three to four times. Over all, we had a three-hour-long power cut on Saturday, when the temperature outside was soaring. We got restless as we did not expect such a sudden rise in temperature followed by power cuts. We have been facing summer-time power cuts due to inadequate transformer capacity and related infrastructure. The work on smart grid remains incomplete and this leads to scheduled load shedding for maintenance purpose. These all are perennial complaints of residents, although the officials are least bothered to improve situation in any way.”Mayfield Garden residents also complained of power cuts due to short circuit and ongoing maintenance work by the electricity department.“A high tension wire developed a fault in our area and that caused power disruption for one-and-a-half hours. The department takes lot of time to rectify the fault and restore electricity. Short circuits keep on happening as tree branches have covered the electricity wires at several places. They need pruning,” said DC Yadav, resident of Mayfield Garden.Due to the ongoing smart grid work and maintenance of existing electricity infrastructure, the department currently goes for load shedding and scheduled power cuts in one area or the other in the city.Bhawani Shankar Tripathy, Sector 23-A resident, said, “We had two-and-half-hour-long hour power cut with high voltage fluctuation on Saturday.”Most of the complaints pertained to power cuts, followed by voltage fluctuations, complaints of single-phase line, metre burning and transformer fuses getting damaged.As per DHBVN’s record, in the last five days, i.e. from Tuesday to Saturday, the city’s electricity consumption rose from 1.84 crore units to 2.13 crore units, thereby recording an additional consumption of 29 lakh units.“There are power cuts and some fluctuations as maintenance works are going on at places and we are trying our best to keep the distribution uninterrupted. We have received complaints from the residents and are trying to fix the problems,” said Joginder Singh Hooda, DHBVN superintending engineer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/as-mercury-soars-power-cuts-and-voltage-fluctuations-return-to-haunt-residents/story-ejkJ2vq3CWWOxvwxgPm4sM.html
24-05-2020||Gurugram||Fire at cosmetic factory doused after 30 hours||A fire at a manufacturing unit of hand sanitisers and cosmetics in Kherki Daula was put out after 30 hours on Sunday. The fire at Stella Industries Limited, which started around 9.15am on Saturday, was doused at 3pm on Sunday.Fire department officials said they had managed to contain the fire at the three-storey establishment around 4pm on Saturday, but a combination of chemicals, used in the processing of hand sanitisers, along with plastic containers resulted in the fire continuing in the basement of the building for another 23 hours.“The plastic containers, in which the solution of hand sanitisers is added, melted due to the fire and disfigured in such a manner that they formed a layer on top of the basement and prevented water from seeping through below. The highly flammable chemicals were stored below this layer and they continued burning as water couldn’t pass through. Finally, around 7am on Sunday, we used air-pressure machines to shift the topmost layer of plastic and started dousing the fire below,” said IS Kashyap, assistant divisional fire safety officer.Kashyap said that a total of 21 fire tenders were used to douse the fire, as part of a phased operation — all 21 were used in dousing operations until 4pm on Saturday, after which only 12 tenders were deployed and subsequently, this number was reduced to six early Sunday morning.Fire department officials said that since March 25, when the national lockdown to control the spread of coronavirus was enforced, the company, which manufactures cosmetics, toiletries and other personal care products, had only been manufacturing hand sanitisers.“The owners of the company today (Sunday) informed us that on Saturday, they resumed production of perfumes and deodorants. As soon as they started, one of their machines on the ground floor started sparking and the chemical vapour in the container caught fire, which subsequently spread throughout the building,” said Kashyap.He said that all workers inside the building managed to escape unhurt when the fire was just starting to spread. He also said that occupants of five residential buildings located in the vicinity had left the area as a precaution and returned by Saturday evening, when the fire was contained to the basement.Kashyap said that the company had a conditional no-objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department as their building plan approval was pending. They were given a conditional NOC, with a final one to be obtained in six months. He said that the company had proper entry and exit routes, and the necessary firefighting equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/fire-at-cosmetic-factory-doused-after-30-hours/story-4KJvf3uFxSfsINQbmRzFyI.html
24-05-2020||Gurugram||Would like to meet Ivanka Trump one day, says ‘cycle girl’ Jyoti Kumari||Fifteen-year-old Jyoti Kumari, who caught global attention after she was forced to peddle a distance of nearly 1,200 km from Gurugram to Darbhanga in Bihar with her injured father riding pillion on the bicycle, has expressed her wish to one day meet US President’s daughter Ivanka Trump who had tweeted on Jyoti’s ordeal.Speaking over the phone from her village Sirhulli, Jyoti said she did not know who Ivanka was at first, and came to know about her just recently. “I didn’t know who Ivanka was, but after her tweet some media persons told me about her. I would certainly like to meet her one day,” she said.Senior White House adviser Ivanka on May 22 had tweeted that Jyoti’s “beautiful feat of endurance and love has captured the imagination of the Indian people and the cycling federation.”Jyoti’s ordeal had become the talking point on social media even prompting the Cycle Federation of India (CFI) to offer her a trial at the IGI Stadium complex in New Delhi.The 15-year-old said ever since she has got back to her village, many people have been reaching out to her. “So many people have come and visited me in the last few days. Every day there are journalists who are lined up to take my interviews. On average, I give six to seven television interviews these days,” she said.The 15-year-old said she feels like a celebrity now, and hopes that one day a Bollywood director would make a movie on her life. “There are people who come to meet me only to get selfies.”Stranded in Gurugram for more than two months amid the nationwide lockdown, Jyoti and her father, Mohan Paswan, had decided to leave the city on May 10. The duo bought a second-hand bicycle with the little money they had left with them, and Jyoti asked her injured father to sit on the rear seat as she set out for the arduous journey to her village in Darbhanga district.She said playing ‘pitthu’ (seven stones—a traditional game played with a ball and stones) every day with her neighbours prepared her for the journey wherein she peddled more than 150-km daily. “As a kid I used to play pitthu which helped to strengthen my legs. When my father asked me if I could cycle back home I agreed instantly. Also, I like cycling and my father knew that I can cycle for long hours without getting tired,” she added.Apart from the fame, the long, back-breaking journey brought her, Jyoti also has something else to be cheerful about. The Darbhanga district administration has now granted Jyoti, who had dropped out of class 8 a few years ago, admission into class 9 at a government school. “I had left school a few years ago because my family was going through financial problems, but now I have got admission in class 9. I would like to study further and finish my education,” said Jyoti, who wishes to hold a graduation degree in a few years. The teenager and her father have been put under a 14-day quarantine by the district administration at a center in her village for now. “When Jyoti and her father set out to come home, I informed the village panchayat about them. However, everyone was scared that they might spread the coronavirus disease in case they are infected, and the panchayat decided to quarantine both of them in a nearby school,” Phula Devi, Jyoti’s mother. Her mother, who has also shifted to the quarantine center, said that ever since Jyoti has returned from Gurugram numerous people have come forward to help their family. “We have received around ₹35,000 in donations. I never expected that we would get this sort of money amid the lockdown. There are others who have come forward, and have promised to get her a new cycle,” said Devi.When asked about CFI’ offer, Jyoti said she would come to New Delhi after her quarantine period is over and give the trials. “I will definitely come to Delhi and give the trials. I want to compete,” she said.Meanwhile, CFI said they will conduct a trial for Jyoti to check if she can pursue cycling at a national or international level, but it will not be an easy task. “After her quarantine period gets over we will see how she performs in the trial. Later, she will have to be trained for at least four years before she can start competing at the national level,” said Onkar Singh, chairman, CFI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/would-like-to-meet-ivanka-trump-one-day-says-cycle-girl-jyoti-kumari/story-eJ9SLyblm58ThlGPtm5YbI.html
24-05-2020||Gurugram||In Gurugram, expats add desi twist to beat lockdown food challenges||Expats living in the city, as the Covid-19 pandemic rages on and a lockdown is enforced by the administration, have been forced to tweak their palates and find joy in more humble food items of daily offerings.So, most of them have tried to innovate by replacing their imported food products with desi items on their kitchen shelves. Smoked salmon has given way to local prawns, frozen parathas have come on the menu in place of European bread, sausages have been replaced by chicken with skin or eggs, as many shops selling imported items have found it hard to replenish their stocks owing to the closure of international borders.Many shop owners in the city said that they have told their patrons that stocking up on imported food has become difficult.SM Verma, department manager, La Marcche said, “Imported cereals disappeared from our shelves even before the lockdown began. We ran out of stock of Italian pasta. Most foreigners then started relying on Indian products.”Online food stores said that prices of certain imported products have gone through the roof.Digvijay Singh Kushwa, who runs an online food store, Digi Fresh, said, “Avocados from New Zealand and blue berries are out of stock. However, we have identified an importer who could replenish our stocks but obviously at a high price.”Some South Koreans, who purchase food products from premier imported shops in the city, claimed that even essential products were hard to find in such stores during the ongoing lockdown.Ja Young Lee, who has been living in the city for the last eight years, said, “There is a Korean shop where we get most of the ingredients used in preparing Korean food. However, Korean sauce, which is one of the main ingredients of our food, is not available. So, we had to do with whatever we had.”The Korean community relies on WhatsApp groups to help each other out . “Korean people give whatever they had stocked up in their kitchen to others who were running short. A family helped me in getting some sauce also, so it worked out well,” added Lee.Like Lee, most expats in the city said are relying on the second best option available to them, Indian food products. For some, this alternative food has even proven to be yummier than their usual fare.Seiko Uchida, a Japanese expat who lives in an apartment complex on Golf Course road, said, “As imported juices were not available at any stores in the city, I introduced my kids to flavoured drinks, which they immensely loved. The stores had also fallen short of European bread, so I found stuffed paratha packet and we liked the spices and enjoyed it. Now, my kids want me to make parathas.”Unlike stuffed parathas, Andrey Khon — who works as a station manager of Uzbekistan Airways in New Delhi — said there was a shortage of some basic seafood in the city. So his family tried Korean delicacies as many Korean food stores were open during the lockdown period.“Seafood, which I could easily buy, like smoked salmon, oyster, mussels, had disappeared,” said Khon. He then fell back on prawns, which were easily available as a replacement for his favourite salmons. “I have Korean blood running in my family and they have always liked Korean food.We relied on getting food products from Korean marts at South Point Mall,” added Khon.Like Andrey, Fernanda Ramos from Brazil who lives in Sector 53, siad she has found it hard to get poultry in the city markets.Ramos bought a dozen eggs every third day, to replace chicken which was not easily available in the city, she said. “I had problems in buying chicken and yeast for bread. All markets experienced supply problems because of the restrictions placed at the Delhi-Gurgaon border. I had to survive on eggs for many days as the products available in the supermarkets were not sufficient,” said Ramos, who has been living in the city for three years.For Japanese-born Jintatsu Asada, who came to Gurugram six years ago, getting hold of chicken with skin was a challenging task. He and his family relied on sausages instead of their favourite chicken with skin.“I was not able to find any shop where I could buy chicken with its skin. In India people eat chicken without its skin but in Japan we eat it with its skin and that’s where the taste lies. So, I normally would get the chicken with the skin in a local market. But, now with the lockdown in place, i couldn’t find it. No online delivery store was giving us this option either,” said Asada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/in-gurugram-expats-add-desi-twist-to-beat-lockdown-food-challenges/story-ciGI3uWYH35vVpNrzAb5hN.html

She claimed this was in line with the original alignment proposed during the tenure of the SAD-BJP government in Punjab, and fulfilled a long standing demand of residents of Amritsar. “As per the alignment that the Congress government in the state submitted, the expressway was to be diverted 60 km ahead of Amritsar, near Kartarpur, and there was a provision for upgrading the existing NH-3 from Kartarpur to Amritsar. Now, the Union ministry had acceded to my request to include an additional green-field highway between Kartarpur and Amritsar to ensure direct connectivity between the holy city and Delhi,” she added in a release.She went on to add that she had also conveyed to the highways ministry that since the expressway was aimed at promoting tourism and connected two major shrines, it should also pass through important Sikh shrines of Sultanpur Lodhi, Khadoor Sahib, Goindwal Sahib and Tarn Taran.“This proposal, if accepted, will enhance the glory of the Sikh shrines and ensure ‘Khule Darshan Didar’ of the holy places,” she said, adding that a new Sikh religious circuit would be created once the expressway was re-aligned, adding it would facilitate pilgrims from around the world. She added that the project would also give a huge boost to the economies of the cities and areas it touched.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/delhi-amritsar-katra-e-way-to-connect-amritsar-harsimrat/story-wYYwUMJLNQUskPVI9dmjeM.html

24-05-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana’s 4 thermal plants told to pay for defying emission norms||The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has directed four thermal power plants of Haryana to pay environmental compensation of ₹18 lakh per month for each of their units that failed to comply with the prescribed emission norms.These plants have been identified as Indira Gandhi Thermal Power Plant (units 1, 2 and 3) in Jhardli of Jhajjar district, Rajiv Gandhi Thermal Power Project (units 1 and 2) in Khedar of Hisar, Panipat Thermal Power Plant (units 6, 7 and 8) in Assan of Panipat district and Deen Bandhu Chhotu Ram Thermal Power Station (units 1 and 2) in Pansra of Yamunanagar district.As per the orders, the CPCB has issued the directions considering the environmental concerns under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act 1986. The plants have been told to pay the amount by June 5.The order mentioned that the environment, forest and climate change ministry had amended the emission ceiling for particulate matter and notified the new limits for sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and mercury, and water consumption limit for coal/lignite-based thermal power plants. As per the notification of December 7, 2015, thermal plants are required to achieve the notified limit within two years from the date of notification.These power plants, that were to be retrofitted with modern flue-gas desulfurisation (FGD) units which cut emissions of sulfur dioxide, did not comply with the norms.A study by IIT Kanpur on air pollution and green house gases in Delhi in January 2016 had indicated that 13 thermal power plants with the capacity of over 11,000 MW in the 300-km radius of Delhi were expected to contribute to secondary particulate pollutants, and considering the impact of coal-based power plants on ambient air quality in Delhi-NCR and the timelines given by the ministry of power for thermal plants within the specific limits were revised on December 31, 2019.These plants were told to take immediate measures like installation of low NOx burners and achieve progressive reduction to comply with the revised emission limit by 2019.Earlier, show-cause notices had been issued to the said power plants for not adhering to the environmental norms. As per the orders, the compliance of the directions will be reviewed by the CPCB periodically and further directions will be issued.“Haryana Power Generation Cooperation Limited has been told to ensure the compliance of the directions, failing which action as deemed fit will be taken in accordance with the provision of the Environment (Protection) Act,” the order read.Haryana Power General Corporation managing director Mohammed Shayin said, “We will file an appeal against the order as we were unable to stick to the norms due to the Covid-19 issue.”Haryana State Pollution Control Board member secretary S Naryanan said, “With reference to the latest CPCB directions, we are taking up the matter with the units concerned for immediate compliance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-s-4-thermal-plants-told-to-pay-for-defying-emission-norms/story-yfbW1N5KZyjKAoRCSXEaKP.html

24-05-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers in Ambala anxious over labour shortage ahead of paddy sowing season||As migrant labourers continue to leave for their hometowns, farmers’ anxiety is shooting through the roof ahead of the paddy sowing season in the region.After facing a similar problem during wheat harvest, farmers in Ambala are bracing for another period of labour shortage. Paddy is grown on nearly 80,000 hectares of land in the district.Harvinder Singh, a farmer from Sonda village near Hisar Road said his labourers were like family to him, but they left a few days ago due to panic and rumours without informing him.“There were around 15 labourers from Bihar working for years with us, but many of them believed that they might get stuck here if the impact of this pandemic increases. Sowing paddy will be a challenge for us without them. There is no support regarding machinery from the government, but we are expecting something in the economic package from the Centre,” he said.Another farmer from Ambala said that he even offered ration and medical services to his labourers, but they insisted on leaving due to the infection scare. The farmer said this time he may have to sow paddy seeds with the help of his family.This season comes as a test even for the state government after it altered some rules of paddy farming under the ‘mera paani, meri virasat’ scheme in many districts, including Ambala, owing to depleting water table in these areas.Terming the labour engaged in paddy sowing as a sociological aspect, Ambala deputy director of agriculture (DDA) Girish Nagpal said, “This will boost mechanisation of agriculture through DSR (direct seeding of rice) equipment that are in great demand nowadays and subsidies will also be dispersed for the same. While there is no study as of now on this elevating their profitability, but the technique will definitely make the sowing compact and timely.”About the new scheme, the DDA said, “In Ambala, availing the scheme is a choice as water depletion is not that bad. Till now, farmers with 1,000 acres of land have given their consent for it and we are hoping for more in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-in-ambala-anxious-over-labour-shortage-ahead-of-paddy-sowing-season/story-6pGilXvYoxBQQMI2WCwVQP.html

As many as 200 gym owners apprised the administrations of three cities the “near collapse” situation of the sector.Sanjeev Kumar, president of TGOA, said, “We were hoping for some relaxations during the fourth phase of the lockdown as the same has been extended to other industries such as beauty and wellness centres, which are also client interaction-based industries. However, the government has not allowed us to reopen our centres. This has not only created an uncertain future for our members, but also for about 3,000 employees and their families.”“There has been no income for employees (trainers, sales staff, spotters and house-keeping),” he added.Preetpal Sandhu, vice-president of TGOA, said, “We request the administration to help this industry survive. The administration should pass orders to landlords for waive off rents or defer the collection of rent for at least six months. Moreover, the administration should work out some financial package so that the centres are able to pay the salaries of staffers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gym-owners-in-and-around-chandigarh-seek-relaxations-in-lockdown-rules/story-Gdlj4xHl07YLyAV3C94fJK.html

Such officers are obeying the dogs for saving their position”.

24-05-2020||Pune||Deprived of work migrants want to return; request Maha-Metro to make travel arrangements||Migrant labourers who returned to their hometowns in March during the lockdown are now eager to return to Maharasthra to re-join work. Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (Maha-Metro) which is executing metro rail work in Pune has received requests from the labourers to arrange for their return journey.These labourers are from Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and other states.According to officials around 50 per cent of total 2,800 Maha Metro work force has returned to their hometowns, hampering the work here.Atul Gadgil, director, Maha-Metro said, “We have got requests from many labourers that they want to re-join work after the break of two months. Due to pandemic they returned to their respective states but now want to return.”“ As train and bus services is not operational, Maha-Metro has written letters to various district administrations in other states mainly Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and other states and requested to make arrangements for these labourers to return in Pune,” said Gadgil.“Right now we can’t give the exact figures of the labourers who want to return to re-join work,” said Gadgil.Gadgil said, “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic in India and Maharashtra, many labourers left work in March and returned home. No, as there is no source of income for them they want to return to work. So they have requested us to make arrangements for their return journey.”Gadgil said, “We wrote the letters to the district collectors of Bhopal, Vidisha and Raisen and others to permit labourers to travel from their district to Pune.”Maha-Metro is executing the metro work on two corridors in between Vanaz to Ramwadi and Pimpri to Swargate. Metro would require 7,000 to 8,000 workers for carrying out the work on various corridors. But due to Covid-19 many labourers flew away. Metro is working in hardly 25 per cent labour capacity.Gadgil said, “Right now only pre-monsoon related and underground tunnel work is going on by considering less work force. The district administration and Pune Municipal Corporation had permitted the metro to carry out the construction work activity during lockdown.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/deprived-of-work-migrants-want-to-return-request-maha-metro-to-make-travel-arrangements/story-HOWFtJ2vkab3JCEwq9geiI.html

Till they leave Punjab, they should be provided food and water, the CM directed the officials.The CM also urged the migrants not to panic assuring them that the state government would make sure that they will be assisted by the Punjab government in their return back home. Amarinder said more than 10 lakh persons have registered on the state portal for outbound movement from Punjab. The state government has undertaken a massive validation exercise of all registered persons by making individual phone calls to re-ascertain whether or not they are keen to return to their native states. “This is being done in view of the fact that, in the past 3-4 days, around two-thirds of the industrial units in the state have commenced operations after the easing of restrictions, following which the number of persons keen to travel out of Punjab has reduced considerably,” he said, terming it a welcome sign.However, the state government would continue to ply trains to the states concerned till such time persons evince desire to return home, said Amarinder, adding that the state government has had already paid Rs 20 crore to railways for free travel of migrant workers to their respective states following its decision in April month to provide them free travel and food.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ensure-no-migrant-goes-hungry-walks-back-home-capt-to-dcs/story-izBOVg29PFOY9geWcbUKTM.html

No loss of life was reported as the mill was closed on account of a Sunday.As many as 50 fire tenders, including those hired from nearby districts, were pressed into service. The firefighting operation was still on when the report was filed.Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has directed deputy commissioner (DC) Pradeep Kumar Agrawal to look into the matter and submit a report.In his tweet the CM stated, “I have directed DC Ludhiana to look into the reasons behind the fire that broke out at RT Woollen Mills today. Luckily, there have been no casualties. The fire department took prompt action and prevented the fire from spreading and causing more damage.”Deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal has ordered a magisterial probe into the incident. He said sub-divisional magistrate (SDM, West) Amrinder Singh Malhi has been appointed the inquiry officer.Sub-fire officer (headquarters) Srishti Nath Sharma said, “We received a call about the fire at 12.30pm. Soon after receiving information, a firefighting team reached the spot and started operation to control the flames. As many as 50 fire tenders, including those hired from nearby districts, were pressed into service. The process is still on to douse the flames.” Nath said, “No loss of life was reported as mill was closed. We were told that the factory was locked. The reason behind the fire was not known yet. The fire broke out on the top floor of the three-storey building and spread to the lower floors.”Nath said the people, living in the neighbourhood, spotted the flames and informed the fire brigade. Nath said the incident had taken place in the same area where a fire had broken out in a factory three years ago.Firefighters were still dousing the flames emerging from gunny bags containing polyester yarn when this report was filed.Mill owner Tara Chand said one of his sons was wounded while helping the firefighters in dousing the flames. He suspected short circuit to be the reason behind fire incident.PREVIOUS INCIDENTYarn worth lakhs was also gutted after a godown of a yarn manufacturing unit in Machhiwara caught fire on May 10, also a Sunday.Over 100 fire tenders from nearby districts were pressed into service to douse the flames. The firefighting operation reportedly lasted for over 10 hours. Here, too, the cause of fire was not known.NO FIRE AUDIT SO FARIn 2018, a fire audit for the city was announced by the then local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, months after a plastic factory collapsed during a firefighting operation near the Suffiyan Chowk. As many as 16 people, including nine firefighters, had died in the incident that occurred on November 21, 2017.But, no audit has been conducted in the city so far and thousands of factories/commercial units continue to be run without fire safety measures and no objection certificate (NOC) and the city continues to sit on a powder keg.The fire audit commenced in March 2018, but was suspended within a month.At that time, fire brigade and municipal corporation (MC) officials claimed that all the buildings, including commercial and industrial, would be inspected and corrective steps taken. They were to inspected if units had stored highly inflammable or combustible material illegally.However, the fire brigade team could manage to inspect only 35 hospitals in different parts of the city and seven buildings in the Feroze Gandhi market.No follow-up was undertaken to check whether corrective steps had been taken by building owners or not. Senior officials gave the shortage of staff as the reason behind the same.‘FIRE DEPARTMENT ILL-EQUIPPED’A number of fire incidents take place during summer, but the fire department is allegedly ill-equipped to tackle the situation.The absence of a hydraulic ladder and the dilapidated condition of tenders are the major concerns of the department, but the MC and the local bodies department have not paid attention to these problems.Assistant divisional fire officer (ADFO) Bhupinder Singh said the process of procuring the firefighting equipment was delayed due to lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yarn-worth-lakhs-gutted-as-woollen-mill-godown-catches-fire/story-519bGkDHYlTGLjh7qDEJ4I.html

However, with the restoration of flights from Monday, the testing will be increased as the government plans to set up separate testing kiosks at the Srinagar and Jammu airports. At Srinagar airport, 30 testing facilities have been created, officials said.Till date, 13,2594 people in contact with suspected cases have been put under surveillance—31,816 in home quarantine, 71 in hospital quarantine and 28,600 under home surveillance. Besides, 71,295 people have completed their 28-day surveillance period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-reports-52-fresh-covid-19-infections-tally-rises-to-1-621/story-WBJQx15DflYcDiVxhejSqL.html
24-05-2020||Mumbai||Scores of dead fish found along Boisar coast as lockdown restrictions on industries ease||Scores of dead Indian mullet fish were found dead along the Navapur coast in Boisar MIDC area since the ease of lockdown norms in the past few days. A zoologist has attributed to the deaths due to heavy pollution of discharge of effluents from the several chemical units lining the Navapur coast. Prior to the lockdown, no such incidents were reported.“The dead fish belongs to a local variety which is consumed by the locals. The incident was reported in Dandi-Navapur area in Boisar,” said Prof Bhushan Bhoir, zoologist, Sonopant Dandekar College, Palghar. “It seems the untreated effluents from the chemical units were discharged directly into the Navapur creek, leading to the deaths,” said Bhoir. Even the colour of the water has changed from brown to reddish since Friday evening, he said. Kundan Dhawne, member, Akhil Bharatiya Mangela Samaj Parishad has complained to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), Tarapur to initiate action against the guilty chemical owners who discharged the effluents into the creek.Earlier during the lockdown period, the colour of the water was near clear and small fish which we could not see since the past decade started to swim around, said Dhawne. Within a span of just eight days since the restrictions on industries were lifted, the fish deaths have been reported, he said.Bhoir said, earlier the dissolved oxygen content (DO) in the Navapur Dandi creek was 4.5mg/litre while the same DO at Satpati was 7.2 mg/litre and Vadrai creek was 6.081 mg/litre. On the day when the fish deaths occurred, the DO was a mere 1.2 mg/lt. A minimum of 3.5 mg/lt oxygen is required in water for the marine species to survive, said Bhoir. Now with the industry resuming, the effluents are discharged into the creek. Because of this, the oxygen dissolved in water reacted with the chemicals. As a result, hypoxic conditions were created in the creek killing several small and young fish during the low tide. All adult fish travelled deep into the Arabian Sea and small fish suffered from hypoxia and died, said Bhoir.Manish Holkar, deputy regional officer, MPCB, Tarapur said, “We are aware of the fish deaths in Navapur-Dandi creek and we have collected the water as well as fish samples to ascertain the exact cause behind the deaths. We are waiting for the lab results and if the chemical units are found guilty, we will take punitive action against them, including issuing closure notices and disconnecting water and power supply to the errant units,” said Holkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/scores-of-dead-fish-found-along-boisar-coast-as-lockdown-restrictions-on-industries-ease/story-L6VWXjKOpEPOdp4NYeFfJI.html

The work on the junction assumes all the more importance given the fact that scores of devotees pass through the junction on their way to Sri Fatehgarh Sahib. The minister said that the new junction would rid the area of the menace of traffic jams. Directing the public works department (PWD) officials to ensure quality and transparency, Sidhu asked them to keep checking the construction material at regular intervals.Meanwhile, the beautification of the 28-km stretch from Mohali to Sirhind by laying a premix is also underway. The 800-metre section of the two and a half km junction at Landran will be four-laned. The project will incur a total cost of ₹25.33 crore and will also include two slip roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fourlaning-of-landran-t-junction-in-mohali-on-fast-track-says-balbir-singh-sidhu/story-II2ExJJf31cgjqZmziczsL.html

At present, there are over 5,388 positive cases in Thane district, which is in the red zone. Rajesh Narvekar, district collector, said, “The state on May 19, issued guidelines for lockdown-4 which states that shrines will be closed for any religious gathering. Moreover, any religious meetings or processions cannot be held until May 31. I want to appeal to all the members of the Muslim community to stay indoors and celebrate Eid with their families. They can meet their friends and relatives on social media through video calls.”Several NGOs have also appealed to the people to stay home and not to visit the markets.For 12-year-old, Abdul Azizi Mukaddam, who resides in Mumbra, he will miss spending time with his friends and going to fun fares. “This year owing to the coronavirus pandemic, we will be celebrating the festival at home with family. There are three huge fun fares in Kausa and Mumbra area which I attend every year with friends, and we spend our Eidi on it, however, this year since there are no fares, I might use the money for some good cause. We did not buy any new clothes nor we did any shopping this year. My friends and I will pray for this crisis to end this Eid.”Eid on Monday will be a toned-down celebration for the entire Muslim community. There will be no hugs or handshakes but a mere salutation, no friends visiting to savour delicacies. The food carts selling delectable dishes too will be missed.Salma Ansari, 26, a resident of Kadar Palace in Kausa, who is associated with Parcham, an NGO, said, “Eid is all about calling friends, neighbours and relatives at home. This year this will be missed as my friends won’t be coming over for Eid. We might visit our next-door neighbours, but there will be no social gatherings.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-collector-appeals-to-tone-down-eid-on-monday/story-R15ISdPXk5bMkkAMpOgGqM.html

A team of 64 healthcare workers participated in this over 24-hour long surgery and successfully separated the twins.The co-joined twin girls were brought to the medical institute when they were just 62 days old with fused lower parts of their bodies. Since, then the co-joined twins were under the close supervision of doctors headed by Dr Minu Bajpai, professor, department of paediatrics surgery.The babies were joined at the hips with a complex fusion of their spinal bones and spinal cords, intestines. There were abnormalities of the heart and major blood vessels along with a lack of adequate skin cover.“Prof. Randeep Guleria, AIIMS Director, took note of the need and promptly granted permission for the surgery to be undertaken even during the COVID-19 pandemic,” according to sources.The family of the twins hail from Uttar Pradesh, Badaun and their parents were counselled at various stages and major procedures in separating the co-joined twins, said a doctor.“Today, the co-joined twin girls are of 2 years of age. When their parents brought them to AIIMS, they were hardly two months old. At that stage, we did not want to separate them as we wanted their bodies to grow enough to bear huge challenges during the separation surgery,” said a doctor.“We were studying their cases, did their vital investigations and took multiple meetings to chalk out the plan for separation surgery.The surgery was successfully conducted by the Department of Paediatric Surgery along with assistance from Anaesthesiology, Plastic Surgery, and C.T.V.S.Department of Radiodiagnosis, Neurophysiology, Nuclear Medicine, Biochemistry, Nursing and Paramedical staff including C.M.E.T. also worked as a team for this 24 hours long operation.Doctors told ANI, “The process of anaesthesia was very challenging as both the girls have a hole in their hearts. Also, their fused spinal cord was creating a problem for bladder and movement of their body. We had to fix it up with the help of neuro-monitoring.”The process involved a team of 64 medical professionals including doctors, nurses, paramedics to conduct the 24-hour marathon surgery. “The reconstruction was lower parts of the bodies was another challenge as it involved reproductive organs,” they said adding that the twins would be able to become mothers in their adulthood.Another doctor said “Since there was only one passage to pass the stool, we have to create another passage for other child. We have to keep the separated twins in close observation for at least 48 hours. As of now, they are stable and their vital functions are doing well.”Experts say that it is a once in a lifetime surgery for any pedantic surgeon. Once the separation procedure starts, doctors have to keep the babies away from external exposure to avoid infections.Medically, conjoined twins fused from back and lower half of the bodies are very rare. Such kind of twins have four arms; one, two, three and four legs, and typically one external set of genitalia and anus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/conjoined-twin-babies-joined-from-back-and-hip-separated-after-24-hour-marathon-surgery-at-aiims/story-qXjvh40DVkl7nIe63SpUqK.html

This is our bad luck,” said a 30-year-old Uri resident admitted in JNV Shahkote quarantine centre in north Kashmir’s Boniyar tehsil.Another Baramulla resident, who has been in institutional isolation since May 10, misses the homemade wazwan. “Every year, we used to prepare a multi-course meal on Eid, but this time I couldn’t relish it. I wish to go home soon,” he said.A 25-year-old Kashmiri student pursuing education from Chandigarh, who is quarantined at a private hotel in Srinagar’s Lal Chowk area, criticised the administration’s callous approach towards them. “Nothing was done to make this Eid special for us. It was the routine menu and we were given only vegetables to eat,” he said.“I video called my folks to know how they were celebrating Eid. They were not enjoying the occasion without me,” said another student from a quarantine centre in South Kashmir’s Pulwama, who was evacuated from Gurugram recently. The valley wore a deserted look on Sunday, with fewer shoppers in the markets in the morning hours. Kashmir Chamber of Commerce Federation and Industries had said on Saturday that they faced losses worth crores of rupees due to the lockdown ahead of Eid.However, doctors and health workers remained on duty on Sunday. “Our full staff was on the job. The health of our people matters to us the most,” said Sameer Mattoo, Kashmir health services director.“We gave them better food today so they would feel as if celebrating Eid at home,” said Zahoor Ahmad Beigh, a paramedic posted at Boniyar primary health centre in Baramulla.Eid is being observed across Jammu and Kashmir and Kerala on Sunday, while the rest of the country will celebrate it on Monday.As per reports, no Eid prayers were offered in major mosques and shrines of Kashmir. However, prayers were offered in far-off villages while maintaining social distancing. In the cities, people preferred to offer prayers indoors.At present, over 50,000 people are under surveillance in over 10,000 government established quarantine centres in the valley.An official from the Kashmir administration said on the condition of anonymity, “The number of patients admitted to quarantine centres was so high that it was not possible to give them special treatment on Eid.”Last year, Eid-ul-Azha prayers were not offered in Kashmir due to the curfew followed by the abrogation of Article 370. This Eid-ul-Fitr marks the end of fasting month of Ramadan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-eid-kashmiris-in-quarantine-centres-miss-home-celebrations/story-kewM8jWxFkOxwmW4mF8EVO.html

Stubble burning post wheat harvesting season is also adding to the problem.The air quality index (AQI) to monitor air pollution indicated unhealthy levels of 200 towards the end of May after recording a low of 36 in Punjab during the lockdown.On May 22, the industrial town Mandi Gobindgarh recorded an AQI of 242, which was in the very unhealthy bracket according to data from the National AQI of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCC).On May 23, the industrial hub of Ludhiana recorded AQI levels of 170. A month earlier, on March 23, it was 36.After harvesting season, increasing cases of stubble burning have added to the problem with 12,575 such cases recorded as against 10,357 cases last year.Pollution levels were increasing for a number of reasons, said Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) chairman Satwinder Singh Marwaha. “The resumption of industrial operations and vehicular pollution after relaxations in the lockdown coupled with farm fire incidences have gradually led to deterioration of air quality in Punjab.”Increasing dust particles in the air due to use of machines during wheat harvesting also added to poor air quality, he said.The AQI level from day one of lockdown on March 22 to April 14 before harvesting was recorded at less than 50 in major parts, including industrial towns.“With the start of the harvesting season after April 15, AQI levels started escalating to over 70 in the ‘satisfactory’ bracket. Now, it has reached ‘moderate’ levels at 150 and even crossed 200 in the past few days,” Marwaha added.PPCB member secretary Krunesh Garg said 12,575 cases of stubble burning had been reported up to May 23. “The board has taken serious note of these fire incidents and imposed environmental compensation of around Rs 40 lakh,” he said.Till date, the PPCB has registered FIRs against 322 farmers under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC. Contending, however, that the farmers could not be held responsible for pollution all data pointed to air quality deteriorating after increase in vehicular pollution and industrial activities, Jagmohan Singh, state general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda), said, “Only scattered incidents of farm fire were reported as farmers listened to appeals of farmer unions not to burn stubble,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/air-quality-levels-back-to-poor-after-lockdown-eased-in-punjab/story-ihA7GSrIrzIR0FRTiBbTQI.html

Despite strong evidence, no action has been taken nor anybody linked to the scam has been arrested,” he said.Chauhan said that this clearly shows the nexus of politicians, bureaucracy and contractors and it will be a betrayal of democracy if the state government does not conduct an impartial investigation of this matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cpi-m-demands-inquiry-into-corruption-in-himachal-health-department/story-8UfTp1x25IAyASjYvG7TpO.html

24-05-2020||City||Congress leader seeks CBI probe into Himachal health department scam||Senior Congress leader and former minister Sudhir Sharma on Sunday said the Himachal Pradesh high court should take suo moto cognizance of the alleged scam in the health department to ensure a fair probe or the investigation must be handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).In a statement issued here, Sharma said, “If a person faces serious allegations of corruption, he is taken into 15-day police remand so that he can be interrogated. It is also necessary that the person in question may not destroy the material evidence necessary to take the case to a logical end. However, in this case, the accused officer AK Gupta, a former director of health department, was first called for questioning and later he was shifted to hospital.”“The vigilance and anti-corruption bureau should have sought police remand for him but they agreed to the judicial custody which is a big mistake,” he said, adding that this provides the accused officer an opportunity to temper with the material evidence or eliminate them. “Something is fishy in the whole episode. Is there any connivance between the police or the accused? Has the accused been intentionally sent to judicial custody instead of police remand?” Sharma said.He said the accused officer cannot be interrogated in judicial custody and he may have been manipulating the evidences and witnesses.Sharma said the second person heard in the audiotape involving the officer that went viral in media is said to be politically influential and police have not arrested him yet. “Need of the hour is that the high court takes cognizance to ensure a free probe or the investigation must be handed over to CBI,” he added.On May 20, the state vigilance bureau had arrested the director of health services on graft charges after an audiotape of his telephonic conversation with a supplier surfaced. He is heard talking about some payment apparently in some equipment purchase deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-leader-seeks-cbi-probe-into-himachal-health-department-scam/story-UcX8lwiGFqT7zUaeh0aKKP.html

24-05-2020||Mumbai||State duration for SRA building acquired for Covid-19 patients, compensation to be paid: HC to BMC||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to respond to an Andheri developer’s plea seeking clarification on how long the civic body will keep possession of a building constructed under the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) scheme. BMC took possession of the completed building to use it as a quarantine facility for Covid-19 patients but did not inform on the duration or amount of compensation it would pay, hence the developer approached the court.A division bench of justices R D Dhanuka and Abhay Ahuja while hearing a petition filed by Sahyog Homes was informed by advocate Nilesh Gala, through video conferencing, that the developer had undertaken an SRA project at Andheri and had completed construction of a couple of buildings. However, construction of some buildings was held as the civic body had not issued other certificates required to continue work on the project.Gala further submitted that as the building acquired by the BMC did not have the occupation certificate or the no-objection certificate in the event of any untoward incident, the civic body would be solely responsible and the developer could not be held answerable for it. He also stated that in light of this, the court should direct the BMC to expedite granting of certificates for the completed buildings in the project as well as disclose the duration till when the building would remain in its custody.Additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan submitted that the state had not been served a copy of the petition. After hearing the petitioner’s claim, she informed the bench that a similar petition had come up earlier on May 11 with almost identical prayers and hence both petitions should be heard together.After hearing the submissions, the bench directed advocate Rupali Adhate for the civic body to file an affidavit within two weeks and to mention the period for which the building was requisitioned and the compensation amount that would be paid to the petitioner. It then posted the petition to be heard along with the earlier petition on June 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-duration-for-sra-building-acquired-for-covid-19-patients-compensation-to-be-paid-hc-to-bmc/story-sYTT9NYpptpNWkKW1H4ulM.html

Locals discovered the bodies of Swami Rudra Pratap Maharaj and Bhagwan Shinde, 50, inside the Sri Nirvani Math in Nagthana village and informed the police about the murders.

The need is to sanitise mobile phones and not impose a ban on them,” he said.Director General Medical Education K K Gupta has directed all the medical universities, institutes, private and government hospitals to ban the use of mobile phones by COVID-19 patients admitted in L-2 and L-3 COVID-19 hospitals.He also directed in-charge of COVID-19 hospitals be provided two mobile phones, so that patients admitted there could speak to there family members and vice-versa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-banned-mobile-phones-inside-covid-19-hospitals-to-hide-their-poor-condition-akhilesh-yadav/story-6FAkvbaGnO6yDOz8jPhRdK.html

24-05-2020||Kolkata||Cyclone Amphan: Bengal governor slams CM Mamata Banerjee for delay in seeking Army’s help for relief work||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday hit out at West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, stating that the Army would have been called three days back to carry out post-cyclone relief work if the TMC supremo had kept the Governor’s office in the loop.Tagging the Chief Minister’s official handle on Twitter, Dhankhar said, “Urge Mamata - be in touch with Guv- had this been done army would have been called 3 days back”.He said that he is distressed and pained at the horrifying spectacle of people suffering for lack of basic facilities for several days and appealed people to stay calm. “Am distressed and pained at the horrifying spectacle of people suffering for lack of basic facilities, now for days. My appeal: Government/agencies must be in overdrive to restore services. Urge people to keep calm, time to bear as reaction can wait,” he added. The Governor has directed all authorities to attend to Raj Bhawan at the end, only after normalcy is restored in the city. He further asked the West Bengal government to “share real loss” regarding Cyclone Amphan with the Central government as “inflating figures is counter-productive”.“Share real loss @PMO India: inflating figures is counter-productive,” he said, tagging the PMO’s handle. The Army on Saturday accepted the West Bengal government’s request for assistance in the restoration of essential infrastructure and services, sending five columns to help Kolkata city’s civil administration.On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his visit to the state, had praised the West Bengal government’s efforts under Chief Minister Banerjee to tackle the situation caused by Cyclone Amphan and Covid-19 crisis.The Prime Minister also announced Rs 1,000 crore relief package for West Bengal and Rs 2 lakh each for the kin of deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured in the destruction caused by Cyclone Amphan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/cyclone-amphan-bengal-governor-slams-cm-mamata-banerjee-for-delay-in-seeking-army-s-help-for-relief-work/story-KJcPjk4z7XPaSxCQERatAM.html
24-05-2020||Kolkata||Kolkata stares at rise in pollution levels due to uprooting of trees by Cyclone Amphan||Kolkata is staring at a rise in pollution levels post-lockdown due to uprooting of thousands of trees in the city by Cyclone Amphan, environmentalists said.The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has said that over 5,000 trees, several of which are over 50 years old, have been uprooted. Environmentalists, however, have put the number at 10,000.The trees, which absorb carbon emissions, had played a significant role in improving the air quality in the city during the lockdown.“More than a third of the roadside trees in the city seem to have been wiped out. We foresee a serious rise in PM 2.5 levels from the first week of September, when an estimated eight lakh vehicles will hit the roads post-lockdown,” environmentalist Somendra Nath Ghosh said.An official of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board said that trees will have to be planted on a large scale during the coming monsoon season.“We will launch a plantation drive once things settle down. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has also called for plantation of trees to restore the green cover,” Member of KMC’s Board of Administrators and former mayor-in-council (Parks), Debashis Kumar said.But first, the uprooted trees have to be removed on an urgent basis and the job is being done on a war footing, he said.“Ten trees will need to be planted to compensate for the loss of one fully-grown tree. This is the standard practice,” he said.Around 200 trees were uprooted in the Rabindra Sarobar area itself, Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) Executive Engineer Sudhin Nandy said.KMDA, custodian of the Rabindra Sarobar Lake, will replant at least 100 of the fallen trees, he said.The extremely severe cyclone has also damaged the world’s largest banyan tree in Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden in Howrah’s Shibpur, Botanical Survey of India scientist Shiv Kumar said.Many other trees in the botanical garden have been uprooted, an official of the establishment said.“We are yet to assess the total damages. We will see which trees can be replanted and where planting saplings of the same species will be required,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-stares-at-rise-in-pollution-levels-due-to-green-cover-amid-cyclone-amphan/story-ceAIs67GQK5v8nZsfIFhAO.html

24-05-2020||Kolkata||Days after cyclone hit state, Kolkata residents recount devastation, horror||When cyclone Amphan was battering Kolkata with wind speeds gusting up to 130 km per hour, residents of Subham-Subhasree apartments in east Kolkata’s Hussainpur – Madurdaha felt their buildings were being rocked on their foundations.“I almost jumped out of my bed and was about to rush outside...Moments later, I realised that it was not an earthquake but the cyclone and that I couldn’t go out,” said Suchismita Biswas, a resident. As the cyclone battered the buildings, chunks of concrete fell off their exteriors. The flat owners are planning to consult a structural engineer for a checkup of the two buildings.The society, comprising two buildings, was handed over to the owners in 2015. Apart from the structural damage the cyclone may have caused, there was other damage. “There was a large tree, almost four-storey in height, in in front of our complex. During the cyclone, a large branch broke off and fell on our gate, damaging the lights at the entrance. A few other branches of some trees located on another plot behind our building also broke off, damaging the wire fencing,” said T Samui, another resident. One of the sliding window panes of a bedroom in one of the north-facing flats was blown apart. Water started gushing in and the bedroom was filled with ankle deep water. A power cut, caused by the snapping of a high tension wire, made matters worse; there has been no electricity in the complex since Wednesday. “The two buildings are running on generator. We have lodged a complaint with the CESC which supplies power... We don’t now for how long the generator can continue to provide power,” said Samui.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/days-after-cyclone-hit-state-kolkata-residents-recount-devastation-horror/story-9Juddw3dcJLWiDX8gYGRjM.html
24-05-2020||Chandigarh||Hopes of hospitality players fly high as flights resume from May 25||Facing losses of approximately Rs 150 crore and grappling with large-scale migrant exodus, the hospitality industry is hoping for a revival after the long-drawn Covid-19 lockdown as domestic flights resume from Chandigarh from May 25.Hotels and restaurants in the city, except those home delivering food, have been closed since March 22 even though other commercial establishments have opened in lockdown 4.0.“If the Central government is allowing travel by train, road and now air, then hotels and restaurants should also be allowed to open. We foresee that eventuality,” says Manmohan Kohli, chairman, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Chandigarh (HRAC).With domestic flights allowed, air travellers will require accommodation and food service, says Ankit Gupta, president, Chandigarh Hospitality Association.MOUNTING LOSSESMost of the approximately 300 hotels and restaurants in the city have incurred losses after the lockdown. “We estimate losses at more than Rs 150 crore in the last two months, which is likely to increase if the closure of the industry continues,” says Arvinder Pal Singh, president, HRAC.The migrant exodus has also hit the industry. “Most of the workforce in local hotels and restaurants comes from Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Nearly 50% have left after inter-state movement was allowed. If the restrictions continue then we expect still more movement of migrant workers from the local tourism industry,” says Gupta.With migrant workers gone, restaurants too are unable to benefit from permissions granted for home delivery of food. “Most of the establishments do not have adequate staff for deliveries so they remain closed,” Gupta adds.Hotels have also been hit because of zero occupancy in the last two months, says Anil Malhotra, executive director, corporate affairs, hospitality, offices and CSR, Nexus Malls.On allied sectors impacted correspondingly, Neeraj Bajaj, president, Chandigarh Business Council, says, “The restaurant industry has a direct huge impact on businesses such as grocery shops, dairy product manufacturers, vegetable and fruit vendors. Employment of professionals like carpenters, plumbers, and electricians is also connected. They have also suffered loss of income,” he adds.Enterprises running from rented spaces have taken the biggest hit. “Such establishments are unlikely to bear the losses suffered and business lost during the last 60 days,” says Kohli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hopes-of-hospitality-players-fly-high-as-flights-resume-from-march-25/story-0w5C63RNFEzzz4hJlKiAEL.html

SOPs of Kerala and other states were also being studied.The administration’s extra cautious stance may be attributed to the fact that the city’s first Covid patient infected a salon worker after returning from the UK in March. An official said that UT was aware of the threat in opening such outlets, but SOPs were well established and people were aware of the importance of social distancing and other hygiene parameters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchkula-administration-allows-opening-of-parks-salons-banquet-halls-with-conditions/story-I2lHrEEfkUraoMkgpB1xYL.html
24-05-2020||Chandigarh||14-day home quarantine for everyone coming to Punjab by domestic flights, trains, buses||Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday said that everyone coming to the state, including those coming in via domestic flights, trains and buses, will have to undergo compulsory 14-day home quarantine.Interacting with people during a Facebook Live ‘#AskCaptain’, the CM said that screening of those entering the state will be done at state and district border entry points, railway stations and airports. Those found to be symptomatic will be sent to institutional quarantine, while others will have to undergo mandatory two-week home quarantine.He announced that rapid testing teams will check on the home quarantined people while the symptomatic ones will undergo testing at hospitals and isolation centres.He cited Punjab’s experience with those who came from Maharashtra and Rajasthan, as well as the more recent case of Dubai, and said that Punjab government will not rely on any certificates of testing from any part of the country or the world.Those returning to India via special international flights are already required to undergo institutional quarantine, as per the Central government’s guidelines.The CM said that there is a likelihood of infection coming to state through people returning from other countries and states. So, the state is taking no chances and has made elaborate arrangements for testing and quarantine.He thanked labourers who chose to stay back and contribute to Punjab’s economic strength. It is vital for the industries to function to ensure livelihood, he said. He urged people to follow social distancing norms at workplaces to avoid contracting coronavirus.Of the migrants who had registered online, nearly half have willingly decided to stay back in Punjab and have started working in the industries, he said, adding that of 2.56 lakh industries in state, 1.5 lakh have resumed operations.He said that his government is facilitating return of migrants through special trains, along with 607 buses, to Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha.“Around 3.25 lakh of the 13 lakh migrants have returned so far while another 17,000 have gone back through buses,” he added.Captain said that the success of Punjab’s strategy is evident from the fact that it has the slowest doubling rate of 86 days against the national average of 14 days.On some school not following directions regarding charging fee online, he asked the Amritsar resident who raised the issue to share details of the school and promised strict action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/14-day-home-quarantine-for-everyone-coming-to-punjab-by-domestic-flights-trains-buses/story-il2aEG3QMgboCWPWVz3kMK.html

24-05-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University syndicate to take a call on fee hike on May 30||The Panjab University (PU) syndicate will take a call on a 7.5% fee hike for self-financed courses and 5% for traditional courses for new entrants in the 2020-21 academic session.A 15-member PU panel set up by the vice chancellor had proposed the hike at a February 20 meeting.The 7.5% increase, however, will be capped at Rs 7,500.The PU syndicate will meet on May 30 with 23 items on the agenda, its first since the Covid-19 lockdown. The last meeting was held in March.The syndicate decision, however, is subject to senate approval as it’s the supreme governing body of the university.The hikes, 10% last year for traditional courses and 7% for self-financed programmes, are a way out for PU to deal with its funds crunch.Self-financed courses run on student fees and are relatively more expensive.However, this year PU officials feel that implementing the new fee structure will be tough because of the lockdown since March.‘SITUATION HAS CHANGED’“The committee made its recommendations in February but the situation is not the same now. Due to the Covid-19 lockdown the economy has suffered and I think it will be good if the syndicate decides not to hike the fee this year,” said a PU senator on condition of anonymity.Chetan Chaudhary, who is also a member of panel that proposed the fee hike in February and registered his dissent over the move during the meeting, said: “The students are already under great stress and panic due to Covid-19 and the hike will create more problems for them. I want them to take a decision in the best interest of the students.”TENTATIVE ACADEMIC CALENDARThe syndicate will also take a call on the tentative academic calendar of the 2020-21 session. The calendar has been formulated considering the Covid-19 lockdown that resulted into the suspension of classes. It has recommended that the ongoing semester be extended for 13 days from June 16 to June 30. During this period, internships, summer trainings, internal assessments and practical examination will be held on the campus.The calendar provides that the exams will be held from July 7 to 30. The tentative date for declaration of results of final semesters is August 1 and for intermediary examinations, the date for results is August 14. The teaching process of ongoing classes at the teaching departments of PU, its affiliated colleges, regional centres and constituent colleges will start from the first day of August. Arun Kumar Grover, former vice-chancellor of PU, said, “Even many top-level universities have turned to online classes for next academic session. As we do not know when the lockdown will be over, I think the varsity should devise some mechanism to minimise the academic loss.”The admissions will start on August 1 and new classes will begin from August 18 to August 28.Saturdays to be working days The academic term which will start from August will have all Saturdays as working days till November 28. For the next semester, the final examinations will start from December 2 to December 24.The nine-day winter break will start from December 25 and the university will reopen on January, 4, 2021, for 90 days, excluding Saturdays and Sundays. ALSO ON AGENDAMembers will also decide on the recommendation made by the committee regarding introduction of certificate courses in Vedic studies. Payment of honorarium to staff members to be deputed on duty for senate elections 2020 will also come up for discussion.PU is also planning to increase the rent for shooting films, canopies, posters and hoarding. As per the proposal, PU will charge Rs 5 lakh as entry for indoor and outdoor shooting, which include tax of Rs 50,000 for shooting per day and Rs 1 lakh as security. Shoots will be prohibited in vice-chancellor’s office, girls’ hostel, administrative block, dental college, dispensary, residential area and in the library.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-syndicate-to-take-a-call-on-fee-hike-on-may-30/story-YMy4Ud8PUCAON2Qm1XJ2cM.html

The state is conducting almost the similar number of tests it was doing in the first week of May, shows the daily status report compiled under the Integrated Diseases Surveillance Programme (IDSP) of the health department till May 21. Maximum 2,975 daily tests done As of now, the maximum number of samples the state collected was on May 7 at 2,975. Three days later, only 1,258 samples were collected, with the figure going down to May’s lowest at 907, data reveals.The state’s testing started getting a little momentum May 18 onwards with the collection of 2,289 samples on May 21. But the daily analysis report says that in the past seven days, the rate of cumulative samples collected per day increasing at an average of 3.2% everyday.Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state nodal officer for Covid-19, said the health department is conducting tests among all categories of the population as directed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Union health and family welfare ministry.“Tests are being conducted as per norms, be it direct contacts of the positive patients, pregnant women, frontline health workers and police personnel or the routine patients visiting flu corners in civil hospitals,” Dr Bhaskar said.Experts, however, question the state’s failure to conduct tests according to daily capacity.‘Testing key to check infection’“Expert have repeatedly emphasised that testing is the key to check the spread of the virus as most patients remain asymptomatic. I fail to understand as why the state is lagging behind despite capacity,” a retired civil surgeon said. No major improvement in daily sample collection is also reflecting on Punjab’s figures in comparison with the national average and state’s testing per million on May 21 was 1,927 samples Against the national average of 1,942 tests per million, Punjab collected 1,927 samples on May 21. The state’s testing figure per million started getting better than the national average on May 6. But it started going down May 14 onwards. The state collected 1,865 tests per million on May 20, equal to the national average.Better than Kerala, way behind HaryanaOn the testing-per-million parameter, Punjab (1,927 on May 21) is doing better than Kerala (1,399) but is way behind neighbouring Haryana whose figure for the same is 2,876. Till May 21, the state conducted a total of 59,618 tests whereas Haryana did 88,138.Ludhiana tops chart, Pathankot on bottom Ludhiana district tops in the number of tests with 6,096 samples tested till May 21. Jalandhar is second with 6,061 samples followed by Amritsar at 3,876 tests. Rupnagar (1,663), Kapurthala (1,597) and Pathankot (1,375) districts have conducted relatively lesser number of tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-punjab-fails-to-ramp-up-testing-despite-capacity/story-ltgyZW22prgETRkb4JQkKN.html
24-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh sports complexes reopen to a new reality: No-contact training||Around 50-60 players and coaches were greeted with a slew of safety measures—screening at the entry gate, temperature scan, sanitising and maintaining a distance of 2m at all times—when they entered the Chandigarh Lawn Tennis Association (CLTA) stadium in Sector 10 for the first time after a gap of two months on Saturday.After taking the lead in opening up its golf course on Wednesday, Chandigarh threw open almost all its government-run sports complexes for all disciplines, barring close-contact games such as wrestling, boxing, hockey, volleyball and cricket.Normally, CLTA facilities are brimming with players, especially post exams, but Saturday gave a glimpse into the changes training and playing will have to undergo in a post-Covid world.A session lasted around 30 minutes with the player and coach never coming close. In a changeover, wherein the second player arrived, the first one left without touching anything.DOS AND DON’TSAarogya Setu app is a must for everyone as part of the standard operating procedure (SOP) adopted by the UT. A parent is allowed to accompany the child but social distancing has to be maintained. Once inside the court, a player needs to carry his sanitizer and ensure a 2m distance is maintained at all times.Individual knocking is allowed with a coach. In case the balls have been brought by the coach then a player is not allowed to touch them and vice versa.“We haven’t allowed players to serve, but they can do so, provided they bring their own balls and collect them on their own as well. The idea is to maintain a safe distance and provide a safe environment for players to train. SOPs have been made and the entire area will be sanitised. The response was good for the first day and we hope it will be better tomorrow,” said Romen Singh, chief coach, CLTA.None of the restrictions, however, mattered to the players considering it was their first outing in two months. “It was nice to finally have a session. The instructions were clear and are for our own safety, so we need to observe them. Mask is not necessary while playing but is important when the coach is giving instructions,” said Nandit Negi, a student who is waiting for his Class 10 results.A similar set-up was witnessed at the Sector 38 sports complex where 10 badminton trainees had their first session in a long time. “We have sanitised shuttles and players are required to sanitise their equipment before and after the session. Chairs have also been placed at opposite ends. We will have 20 elite players each in the morning and evening sessions from Monday onwards,” said badminton coach Surinder Mahajan.Meanwhile, weightlifters also enjoyed their first session at the Sector 42 sports complex along with athletes beginning their training at the Sector 7 sports complex and table tennis players ping ponging at Sector 50 sports complex.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-sports-complexes-reopen-to-a-new-reality-no-contact-training/story-5NTWRSsBTBYvRbuSDpuqAP.html

24-05-2020||Chandigarh||Nearly half of two-wheelers impounded by Chandigarh traffic police during lockdown yet to be claimed||Most of the cars and auto rickshaws that were impounded after the lockdown was imposed in Chandigarh on March 24 have been released, but 48% of the two-wheelers are yet to be claimed.As per the data available with the challaning branch of the traffic police, total 10,576 vehicles have been impounded since March 24, and 4,548 (43%) vehicles are yet to be released. Of these, 217 (13%) of total 1,664 four-wheelers and 4,219 of the total 8,781 two-wheelers lie unclaimed.The percentage of unclaimed vehicles is highest for auto rickshaws, at 84%, even though only 132 three-wheelers were impounded, out of which 20 have been released.Speaking about this, deputy superintendent of police (DSP, traffic) Kewal Krishan said, “Challans as high as Rs 10,000 were slapped on most of these two-wheelers for not carrying valid documents during the curfew. People with cars also had to pay large fines, but most cars have been released. It is possible that car owners have higher spending power.”The DSP added that one reason why people were not claiming autos could be that plying of three-wheelers was banned in the city till May 19.Almost 30% (2,001) of the vehicles impounded during the curfew period till May 4 are yet to be released. On the other hand, 70% (2,547) of the total vehicles impounded during the lockdown between May 4 and May 23 are still lying unclaimed.Vehicles can be claimed by paying the challans at Traffic Lines in Sector 29, Chandigarh. The process takes five days and the traffic police have had to make special arrangements to house such a large number of vehicles.OVER ₹1 CRORE COLLECTED IN TRAFFIC PENALTIES AMID LOCKDOWNSince the beginning of the curfew, the traffic police have collected Rs 1.03 crore in fines. This amount accounts for 20% of their average yearly collection of around ₹5 crore. As per data, Rs 83,23,000 was collected while the curfew was on in the city till May 4, while Rs 20,11,500 was made between May 4 and May 23. Police officers said that most challans were issued during the curfew for driving without permission and upon checking their papers it was found they didn’t have proper driving license, registration certificate and third party insurance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nearly-half-of-two-wheelers-impounded-by-chandigarh-traffic-police-during-lockdown-yet-to-be-claimed/story-qv3omlpwnzyBReE38WxtcL.html

24-05-2020||Mumbai||At 46.5°C, Nagpur is second-hottest location in India||Nagpur was the hottest location in the state and the second-hottest in India on Saturday as heatwave conditions gripped the city and surrounding areas of the Vidarbha subdivision.Nagpur’s maximum temperature on Saturday was 46.5 degrees Celsius, 3.7 degree Celsius above normal, which is the season’s highest maximum temperature so far, the weather bureau said. The second-highest maximum temperature in the state was recorded at Akola at 46 degrees Celsius.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD’s) bulletin issued at 9pm, Churu in west Rajasthan was the hottest at 46.6 degrees Celsius. An orange alert (be prepared) for heatwave conditions has been issued for all districts in Vidarbha till May 27, while a yellow alert (be alert) has been issued for Marathwada for Sunday and Monday. Severe heatwaves are likely to impact parts of northwest, central and peninsular India in the next four to five days, while many parts of northeast India will experience very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall during the same period, IMD said in a statement on SaturdayThe heatwave is likely to affect relief and rehabilitation work related to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic that is ongoing across many parts of the country. However, with a lockdown still in effect across India, albeit with considerable relaxation of restrictions, there is not likely to be as much movement of people or vehicles as there might have been otherwise. “Extremely hot conditions are expected to continue and for this reason we have escalated the level of alert for isolated areas in Vidarbha. Nagpur and Akola were the hottest in the state on Saturday, and could very well be the hottest over the next couple of days. During this period, hot and dry northwesterly winds come from Rajasthan and Gujarat over this region leading to this heat wave. This is the normal weather synoptic feature during this time of the year,” said ML Sahu, deputy director general of meteorology, IMD Nagpur.Although Nagpur’s maximum temperature was the highest this season, it did not beat any records. Last year, the weather station recorded 47.5 degrees Celsius on May 28 while the all-time high was recorded on 47.9 degrees Celsius on May 23, 2013. Nagpur had recorded 47.8 degrees Celsius in 1954, 47.7 degrees Celsius in 2003 and 47.6 degrees Celsius in 2005, according to IMD’s historical data.Other weather stations in the Vidarbha sub division that recorded high day temperatures included Chandrapur and Amravati at 45.6 degrees Celsius, Wardha 45.5 degrees Celsius, Gondia 45.4 degrees Celsius, and Yavatmal 45.2 degrees Celsius.Sahu added that heat wave conditions were declared across Nagpur, Akola and Chandrapur on Friday itself but four other districts (with maximum temperatures above 45 degrees Celsius) were added on Saturday. “We declared heat wave conditions when actual maximum temperature remains 45 degrees Celsius or more irrespective of normal maximum temperature or if the maximum temperature is 4.6 degrees Celsius above normal,” he said.An orange alert is issued when a heatwave is likely to persist for more than four days or a severe heatwave for more than two days. There is a high risk of heat-related illnesses such as a heat stroke for people exposed to the sun for prolonged hours or doing heavy work; children, elderly and people with chronic diseases are also vulnerable. IMD has suggested people avoid heat exposure and stay hydrated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/at-46-5-c-nagpur-is-second-hottest-location-in-india/story-ORVlLBjZH0PweRlA2e7pyL.html
24-05-2020||Mumbai||More than 1,000 coronavirus cases in 11 wards in Mumbai||On Saturday, G (North) Ward, which covers Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim, becomes first ward in the city with more than 2,000 reported cases. Of the 2,005 cases in this ward, 1,514 are from Dharavi (33 new cases were reported on Saturday) and the rest are spread across Dadar and Mahim. Many Covid-19 hotspots have reported spikes in reported cases in the last 10 days. According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) data, around 11 administrative wards out of the 24 in the city, now have more than 1,000 reported cases. On Saturday, N ward, which covers Ghatkopar, crossed the 1,000 mark with 1,012 cases. Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer, said, “The cases are on the expected lines and we are expecting the city to reach somewhere near 40,000 cases by the end of May.”The five wards with the most cases have seen increased numbers in the last 10 days. G (North) ward (Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim) climbed to 2,005 cases on Saturday, compared to 1,316 in May 13. G (South) ward (Worli and Prabhadevi) had 1,206 cases on May 13 and 1,490 cases on May 22. E ward, (Byculla and Mazgaon) reported 1,085 cases as of May 13 and 1,571 cases on May 22. In F (North) ward (Wadala, Sion and Matunga), the number climbed from 1,008 cases on May 13 to 1,534 on May 22. K (West) ward, (Andheri (West), Jogeshwari (West) and Oshiwara), had 1,026 cases on May 13 and 1,510 cases on May 22.Emerging trends show spikes in cases from areas like L ward (Kurla), which had 1,450 cases on May 22 compared to 942 cases on May 12; M (East) ward (Mankhurd, Govandi), which had 1,140 cases on May 21 compared to 771 on May 12. Two other areas that saw drastic increases in the last 10 days are N ward (Ghatkopar), which reported 318 cases on May 12 and now has 1,012. Bandra (East), Santacruz East of H (East) ward reported 1,439 cases on May 22 compared to 859 on May 12. F (South) ward, which includes Parel and Sewri, reported 557 cases on May 12 but has crossed the 1,000 mark as of May 22. Andheri (East), which comes under K (East) ward has also seen increase in cases — 744 reported cases on May 12 compared to 1,055 cases on May 22.Last week, BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal had visited areas in M (East) ward, which includes Mankhurd and Govandi, and asked BMC officials to quarantine 10 people related to every positive case. He also ordered BMC officials to ensure private health care facilities were available in the area. Corporators from areas where cases have increased drastically said citizens need to cooperate with the administration while the BMC must work to ensure healthcare is made available to patients. Vitthal Lokare, the Shiv Sena corporator from Mankhurd said, “I understand there are a lot of problems to be tackled by the administration, but still there are many areas in my ward where citizens are out on the streets. In the end, citizens need to understand, and stay indoors.Kaptan Malik, a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) corporator from Kurla, said, “The cases are increasing day by day, and I feel administration needs to pay more attention to areas of Kurla. There is no proper quarantine or isolation facility in my ward. This needs to be made available for citizens from my area. The officials are working day and night, but somehow it is not enough for the number of cases that has to be handled.”Additional municipal commissioner Ashwini Bhide wrote on Twitter, “BMC has set up 298 Covid-19 care centre-1 [CCC-1] with 32,700 bed capacity. So far, 42,500 people were housed there and 24,800 have got discharged after completing quarantine.” CCC-1 house high-risk contacts from slums who cannot quarantine at home.The areas where the number of reported cases remain low (between 200 to 700 cases) include Dahisar, Borivli, Kandivli, Malad, Goregaon, Mulund, Bhandup, Marine Lines, Dongri and Kalbadevi. In R (North) ward, the number of reported cases has doubled since May 12 (when it had 101 cases) but with 238 reported cases as of May 22, the ward covering Dahisar and parts of Borivli has reported the lowest number of cases in the city.M (West) ward, which includes Chembur, and D ward, which includes Malabar Hill and Chowpatty, have seen a steady increase in the last 10 days. There were 809 cases on May 21, compared to 511 on May 12. In D Ward, there were 812 reported cases on May 22, compared to 563 cases on May 12.Madhav Sathe, former professor of microbiology at Nair Hospital, said, “I assume that in the coming days though cases will go up, but mortality rate will remain the same or come down slightly. Citizens must continue the use of masks, social distancing and hand washing. But I feel relaxation in lockdown restrictions and movement of migrants is also responsible for higher positive cases in last six days in India. However, we must appreciate extraordinary efforts of all frontline healthcare workers, and ensure we stay safe indoors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/more-than-1-000-coronavirus-cases-in-11-wards-in-mumbai/story-ljHyWm8HUpFDwmmAbgw2yO.html
24-05-2020||Mumbai||55% Olive Ridley babies in Maharashtra didn’t survive in 2019-20||Only two-fifths of all Olive Ridley turtle hatchlings made their way to the sea in Maharashtra between 2019 and 2020.According to data collated from different forest ranges by the state mangrove cell and Maharashtra Mangrove Foundation on World Turtle Day (May 23), 12,149 hatchlings survived from 27,254 eggs during 2019-20, which is a survival rate of 44.5%.In 2018-19, the survival rate was 54.4%, with 12,601 hatchlings that made it to sea from a total of 23,131 eggs.Sporadic nesting of turtles is reported from an average of 33 sandy beaches across three districts in Konkan – Raigad, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg. While Sindhudurg witnessed a marked improvement in survival rate, from 47.3% in 2018-19 to 74.3% in 2019-20, Ratnagiri observed a decline to 34% in 2019-20 against 57.4% in 2018-19. Raigad also witnessed a drop from 65.4% to 52.2% over two years.“We must realise that this is preliminary information, and there might be several data gaps since this annual statistical collation from three districts is a relatively new process. We need to study the pattern for at least 10 years to come up with exact trends,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell).Olive Ridley sea turtles are found in warm tropical currents of the Indian and Pacific oceans. A schedule I species under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, they travel thousands of kilometres in the ocean, with only the females returning to their original nesting sites within a minimum of two years, to lay eggs. After a 50 to 60-day incubation period, juvenile turtles break the eggshell, dig through the sand, and crawl to the sea. While females return to their place of birth, males never return to land. “Female turtles use geomagnetic imprinting [navigating to their geographic area of origin using magnetic field] and olfactory [relating to the sense of smell] cues to find their natal areas,” said Harshal Karve, marine biologist, Mangrove Foundation.Changes in weather patterns are the main reason for the fall in survival rate, said Mohan Upadhyay, livelihood assistant, Mangrove Foundation. “Firstly, nesting was delayed due to a series of extreme weather events including heavy rain coupled with cyclones in the Arabian Sea last monsoon. The winter was much warmer than previous years for coastal districts. Following this, there was a spike in maximum temperatures this year from late February. When temperatures rise, it affects the incubation period, resulting in a lower survival rate,” said Upadhyay.Independent experts, however, said the survival rate does not depend completely on extreme weather factors. “Hatchling survival is affected by rising beach temperature and prolonged rainy days can damage some nests. But proper management and protection for natural nests can address these issues. However, even a 44% survival rate for natural in-situ nests is not bad. Focused conservation can help improve this,” said Basudev Tripathi, senior scientist, Zoological Survey of India and member of International Union for Conservation of Nature. Meanwhile, the Mangrove Foundation has commissioned a research study to assess the incubation temperature of nests along the Maharashtra coast. The project is being undertaken by a PhD scholar from the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun. “Atmospheric temperature plays a major role in developing and determining the sex of baby turtles. Temperature data loggers have been deployed at various turtle nesting sites in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg, and the results will help us understand the nesting ecology,” said Karve.A similar study undertaken by the Mangrove Foundation – comparing nesting data from 2002 to 2006 and 2014 to 2019 – has shown that the peak nesting period had shifted from winter months (December) to early summer months (February-March). “Many nests which are now being laid along the Maharashtra coast during the February-March period hatch out in the summer months of April-May when the ambient and sand temperatures tend to be on the higher side [above 32 degrees Celsius], which may lead most of the turtle hatchling to be females. Also, higher nest temperature data suggests a lower survival rate for hatchlings,” said Tiwari. “We are therefore developing solutions to ensure that the hatchlings are protected from higher temperatures through the use of sheds, regular monitoring, and litter-free turtle nesting habitats.”Using some of the results, this year green sheds were installed to cover nesting sites from direct sunlight and high temperatures. “However, the Covid-19 lockdown made material transport difficult,” said Upadhyay.The state forest department, with local NGO Sahayadri Nisarg Mitra, has been educating local communities on sea turtle conservation. “From locating nesting sites, excavation, relocation of eggs, fencing nets, and preventing poaching and flooding, around two persons per nesting site have been trained. The volunteers have begun collating information about the process from nesting to hatching,” said Karve.To further boost turtle conservation, earlier this month the forest department introduced an honourarium of ₹15.63 lakh to locals in Ratnagiri, while the Sindhudurg district administration provided ₹6lakh to ₹8 lakh annually under its conservation management plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/55-olive-ridley-babies-in-maharashtra-didn-t-survive-in-2019-20/story-MOieY3yW01XJQyqj2ueIeI.html

24-05-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra opposes resumption of domestic flights||The Maharashtra government is not in favour of resuming domestic flights to and out of Mumbai, even as it decided to once again request the Centre to allow resumption of local trains for essential services workers. The state has written to the Centre that domestic flight operations from the Mumbai airport cannot be started from Monday. It has, however, said that the state has no problem over the operation of transit flights via Mumbai, the city with the highest number of Covid-19 cases in India It is learnt that the state government has informed the civil aviation ministry that in the absence of required infrastructure at Mumbai airport, it cannot allow domestic flights to land. The ministry had announced that domestic flight operations will begin from Monday from various cities, including Mumbai. Meanwhile, the call on requesting the Centre’s nod for local trains was taken following a high-level meeting between CM Uddhav Thackeray, his senior cabinet colleagues, and NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday.“We have written a letter to the Centre, clarifying that we do not have infrastructure to handle the passengers arriving in the city. It has also been written to them that the city has too many containment zones and more people cannot be allowed to move in there. In such a scenario, residential arrangements for them could be a major problem. The scanning of passengers and then allocating them quarantine facilities at hotels is not possible at this juncture when hospitals and hotels are being acquired for existing patients,” said an official.Similarly, taxi, auto and aggregator services are prohibited till May 31 and cannot be allowed only for air passengers, the official added. “Ground-level transportation facilities may become a major problem if we allowed flights. Allowing passengers from other states to alight at the Mumbai airport and travel to their respective hometowns and the arrangement for their transportation, too, was not possible. This could even prove risky in terms of containing the virus spread,” said another official. In the letter, the state has said that it has no issue over the operation of transit flights between two cities via Mumbai. “We, however, have directed the Mumbai International Airport Limited to put the infrastructure in place for the emergency flight operations, including flying stranded students in other countries and operations for medical emergencies,” the letter has stated.Though the Centre was pushing for resumption of the flights, the state government is believably hell-bent on its decision as it has decided to not amend the notification, which continues the ban on flight operations till May 31. The state’s leadership is also wary of allowing flight operations because the initial surge in cases was due to passengers landing at three airports in the state.Top sources from Mumbai airport, however, said that the airport will be operational as per the Central government’s order. “It is the responsibility of the state government to ensure passengers don’t face inconvenience during their road travel. The airport, however, is fully prepared and will commence flight operations from Monday,” said the airport source.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-opposes-resumption-of-domestic-flights/story-Ik4x9amSdsOYqMCa12JhxN.html

The state health department has, however, clarified that of the total deaths, 42 were in the past 24 hours, while the remaining were over the past fortnight. Twenty-nine of the patients who died were above 60 years of age, while 24 were in the age group of 40 to 59 years and the remaining were below the age of 40 years. Thirty-six of them had high-risk comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension and heart ailments.The month of May saw 36,692 cases and 1,118 deaths in Maharashtra, which included 21,756 cases and 659 deaths in Mumbai. This means 77.75% cases and 70.897% deaths in the state have happened in the past 23 days. The first case of Covid-19 in the state was on March 9. After having crossed 25,000 cases on May 13, the next 5,000 in the state were reported in just three days. The 40,000 mark was breached on May 21 in just five days and another 5,000 infections were amassed in just two days. On May 9, the state tally had touched 20,220. The state took 53 days for its first 10,000 cases.State health minister Rajesh Tope said although cases are on a constant rise in the state, the mortality rate and ratio of cases is much better than many countries and Indian states. “The number of cases per million in US is 4,483, UK 3,709, Spain 4,948, Italy 3,732, Germany 2,130, while in Maharashtra it’s 332. Our number of patients is rising and there is no point denying it. It is because the containment in densely populated areas like Mumbai and MMR is very difficult. But we are prepared to face it. We are augmenting the capacity of Covid Care Centres to 1 lakh beds, Dedicated Covid Centre Health Centres to 15,000 beds and ICU beds to 2,000 in Mumbai,” he said. Tope also spelled out the comparative figures for the mortality rate at the international and national level. He said the mortality rate in US per million is 271, UK 524, Spain 592, Germany 97, while in Maharashtra it is 11. The mortality rate against positive patients in Maharashtra is 3.5%, as against 8.44% in West Bengal, 4.72% in Madhya Pradesh and 5.92% in Gujarat.“Although the number of patients is on the rise in Mumbai, the doubling rate has improved to 14 days. We may not need additional facilities of beds being set up at makeshift arrangements, but the government is all set to take on any eventuality,” chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said during his video conference with doctors attached with the hospitals run by the government, municipal corporation and the doctors of the task force appointed by the government. According to a report prepared by the medical education and drugs department on May 23, the mortality rate in the state stood at 3.40%, down from 7.21% on April 12 and 3.71% on May 12. The country’s mortality rate hovers around 2.97%. The report stated that 69% of the admitted patients are asymptomatic, 26% are symptomatic and 5% critical. The number of tests in the state touched 3,48,026 on Saturday. A total of 2,98,696 of them were negative, which means 14.17 % tested positive. Of the 15,249 samples tested in the past 24 hours, 2,608 tested positive at 17.10%.A total of 4,85,623 people are currently under home quarantine, while 33,545 are under institutional quarantine. A total of 16,414 teams of health workers have screened 65.91 lakh people; 13,404 patients, including 821 on Saturday, have fully recovered from various hospitals after testing positive in the past ten weeks. The recovery rate in the state has reached 28.40%. The state has 2,345 containment zones. According to officials, the rate is expected to see a rise for the next couple of weeks until the downward trend begins. “The spike is owing to the figures in Mumbai and other densely populated cities. Going by the global trend we expect the downward trend to begin in next two weeks and the curve to flatten in another few days,” he said. Meanwhile, the state government extended its Mahatma Jyotibha Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, the mediclaim scheme covering 996 procedures treated in 1,000 empanelled hospitals, to its entire state population. The scheme, which was applicable to 85% of the population with orange and yellow ration cards, will now be available to all until July 31. The notification in this respect was issued on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-608-fresh-cases-push-up-state-count-to-47-190/story-ShuwaUnOuEsMHUm8z3NjnK.html

24-05-2020||Mumbai||Corona warriors in khaki to be honoured with medal||In order to appreciate and honour the exemplary efforts of the men and women in khaki, who are among the frontline workers dealing with the pandemic, the state government has decided to honour the Corona warriors from the police force with emergency service medals. “The home minister recently approved the idea and directed the home department to proceed further. Following this, the home department in a letter dated May 22 asked the director-general of police (DGP) office to submit a detailed proposal for the same,” a police officer said.Kulwant K Sarangal, additional DG (establishment) confirmed the development and said, “The project is at very premature stage. I will discuss it with my superiors and prepare a detailed proposal.”Police personnel from constable to police inspector rank would be eligible for this medal, the source added.In the last two months, many police personnel went beyond the duty line to help the people in distress. This included helping migrants stranded on roads and in slums. Some men in khaki even went to an extent of performing last rituals of those deceased people who had no one in the city to look after them and showed a great side of humanity, an ACP-rank officer said.In Maharashtra, 1,671 personnel tested positive for Covid-19. This include over 900 personnel from Mumbai alone. Total 18 from the force have died so far in the state.Presently, the family of police personnel losing life due to Covid-19 gets a ₹50 lakh compensation from the government and ₹10 lakh from the police martyrs’ funds. In Mumbai deceased policemen gets an additional ₹10 lakh from the police welfare funds. Besides this, personnel who have a bank account with Axis Bank get premium-free term insurance of ₹5 lakh. One family member of the deceased personnel also gets a job in the department.In Mumbai, over 500 policemen who got infected by the Coronavirus disease while performing duty have been given ₹10,000 each as a token of appreciation.Recovered cops to help positive ones on call The Mumbai Police have started a new practice to help their personnel to recover from Covid-19 by asking those cops who have recovered from the disease to call the ones being treated and share their experiences and routine. This is helping the cops at Covid-care centres to better deal with fear and anxiety which comes with the disease. Vinoy Kumar Choubey, joint commissioner of police, law and order, said, “This practice is really helpful as cops don’t feel they are alone at Covid-care centres and it also helps them in improving their health.” 234 booked, 181 arrested for lockdown violations on FridayThe Mumbai Police lodged 51 FIRs against 234 people and arrested 181 of them for lockdown violations on Friday.

24-05-2020||Mumbai||MU unveils grading formula for colleges||More than two weeks after state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant announced that all university students, except final year students, will be promoted based on a gradation formula, the University of Mumbai (MU) released a circular clarifying the rules of gradation. According to the release, MU has requested all affiliated colleges to promote students from non-traditional courses on a 50:50 formula, where 50% is based on internal tests and other projects in the current semester and the other 50% is based on the student’s performance in the previous semester. “If there are any internal exams yet to be completed, colleges should conduct the same online or over phones,” stated the circular released late on Friday.For those from traditional courses (BA, BCom and BSc), where students have no internal marks component, the university has stated that colleges should promote such students on the basis of their performance in the previous semester alone.MU further highlighted that in courses where exams have already been conducted, assessment should be conducted at the earliest. “Colleges should work on the gradation process for all students and results should be declared accordingly and soon, so that institutes can start the process of admissions for all students into the next academic year,” stated the circular.The education minister in his brief earlier this month had requested state universities to schedule all final year exams between July 1 and 30, however, earlier this week Samant approached the University Grants Commission (UGC) requesting permission to skip final year exams and instead promote all students based on their previous performance. However, his recommendation was questioned by the governor of Maharashtra, who is also the chancellor of all state universities. In a previous circular, MU has also made it clear that students with Allowed-To-Keep-Term (ATKT) remarks in their previous semesters will be promoted to the next academic year. “Instead of wasting another academic year, these students are being given a chance to get promoted to the next year, provided they clear these subjects within 120 days of the start of the 2020-21 academic year,” stated previous the university circular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mu-unveils-grading-formula-for-colleges/story-yTjFBtjy99ZzYtBpeW68RI.html
24-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC to rope in 50 doctors from Marathwada||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will rope in 50 doctors from the green zone in Marathwada to help with the healthcare emergency in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. The total number of Covid-positive patients in Mumbai shot up to 28,817 on Saturday with 1,566 new reported cases 40 deaths from Covid-19.In a recently-held meeting between BMC officials and the state health department, it was decided that doctors from Latur and Beed districts (in the green zone of Marathwada), who are willing to help Mumbai’s public health care system, will be inducted into BMC’s medical staff. Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director of Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), is co-ordinating with different medical colleges and research centres to this end.Last week, a team of 45 doctors from Wardha’s Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences were deployed at Seven Hills Hospital in Marol.Lahane confirmed the development. “We are taking all necessary steps to avoid any shortage of medical staff in Mumbai. Considering the outbreak in the city, we have decided to bring doctors from different districts of the state. Not only from Marathawada, but we are trying to rope in doctors from all green zones. Discussions with many hospitals and medical research centres in green zones are going on,” he said. He also said efforts were underway to bring in doctors with private practices who are less than 45 years old.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that with the help of DMER, BMC would deploy doctors brought from other districts at jumbo care facilities like the one at the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) facility at Bandra Kurla Complex. “Considering the manpower requirement, these doctors from others districts and local Covid warriors will be used at jumbo Covid care centres,” he said.Additional municipal commissioner Ashwini Bhide, who supervises assistance to various hospitals, said BMC has 32,000 quarantine beds for high-risk people. For asymptomatic patients, 30,000 beds have been kept ready. “Together, we have around 62,000 beds, which are enough because a large number of people are discharged on a daily basis,” Bhide said. Following guidelines issued by the civic commissioner under the Epidemic Diseases Act, BMC has also taken over more than 4,000 beds from private hospitals and 2,000 more beds at the ward level.On Saturday, BMC confirmed that of the 2,423 Indians who have returned to the city from foreign locations, 1,128 have been quarantined at 43 hotels in Mumbai. The civic body has reserved 3,343 rooms in 88 hotels to keep the passengers returning to India as part of Mission Vande Bharat. Fifteen teams of 50 civic officers have been set up to follow up with the passengers and prevent further spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-rope-in-50-docs-from-marathwada/story-KvD9XV2HWlATWBpPKoeXlL.html
24-05-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: Lockdown lessons: Handle children with care||Like so much else, the Covid-19 pandemic has also upended children’s lives, disrupting their schools and the rhythm of their off-school routine. Home bound, they now spend more time glued to smart phones and television screens, hardly getting any time for outdoor activities. All this adds up to stress and anxiety which can impinge on their mental health and well-being.People manning Childline 1098, a service of the women and child development ministry, allowing people to phone in and seek help for children, say the number of parents dialling up to discuss their children’s behavioural problems has increased during the lockdown.Sangeeta Jund, director, Childline 1098, had told Hindustan Times recently that two couples had called to say their children were “virtually out of their control”. While one couple and their child were being counselled, the other, parents of a 16-year-old girl, were firm in their decision to send her away as they said she kept running away from home, issued self-harm threats and refused to give up smoking.The teen has, unfortunately, been moved to a home again.The added stress of managing a household while being locked in, looking after children, performing chores, taking on additional anxieties about living in a world where a pandemic rages, where jobs are drying up and money disappearing fast, is taking its toll on adults.The problem is also magnified when children are expected to start existing within confined spaces, days on end, with anxious adults trying to cope with a never-before-experienced scenario.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research, 12% to 13% schoolchildren in India have emotional, behavioural and learning problems. Understanding this and seeking help from a counsellor is one way out, but many parents are today mentally conditioned to sweep such issues under the carpet as society still stigmatises them.In all scenarios, however, patience, perseverance and understanding can lead to peaceful coexistence of adults and children at home. Innovative methods and practices brought into play, quality time spent together as a family, exercising and being creative does not just help the child, but the adult as well.It’s still unclear how long the Covid-lockdown will last, but one thing is clear: The changes are here to stay, with such future lockdowns a grim possibility.Parents have their roles cut out. Helping children cope mentally and physically with such scenarios, getting them to expend energy, experience stillness and calm, joy and peace and keeping those brain cells ticking is what adults have to ensure. On them rests the onus of shaping young minds and bodies to take on the uncertain times now and in the future with confidence and positivity,But the question is: Are they equipped to do it?AT HOMEHow should parents handle children’s behavioural problems?What should parents do to equip children to handle the Covid-19 lockdown at home peacefully and productively, especially for those with behavioural/mental health problems?

24-05-2020||City||Ludhiana liquor contractors shut vends as govt fails to provide relief||Liquor contractors in over a dozen groups in Ludhiana kept their shutters down on Saturday, ruing the government’s failure to provide them relief against the losses incurred during the lockdown period. The city has 96 liquor groups, each having three to four vends on an average. Contractors in other groups are expected to follow suit in the coming days. Areas where vends have been shut include the Model Town market, Malhar Road, Link Road (near Preet cinema), Model Town-Jawaddi road among other areas. Earlier, too, when the state government had allowed the sale of liquor in the state, contractors in Ludhiana had refused to open the vends for at least a week. They had finally relented on May 15 after government assurance that relief would be provided soon.Liquor contractor Varinder Sharma Bobby, who is leading the contractors, said, “Not only in Ludhiana, vends have been closed in Bathinda, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur and some other places too. We had met ministers, including Vijay Inder Singla (education) and Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria (housing and urban development) last week and they had assured that relief would be provided soon. However, nothing has been done.” Another contractor, on the condition of anonymity, said many were reluctant to open the vends due to low sales but they had earlier opened it under pressure from government and administration. “We want compensation for the loss incurred in the last financial year due to imposition of curfew on March 23. Huge sales are witnessed on March 31 every year but this year, the vends remained closed due to the curfew,” said the contractor, adding, “We also want the withdrawal of quota condition in the excise policy 2020-2021.”Deputy excise and taxation commissioner (DETC) Pawan Garg said that government is expected to announce a relief for contractors in the coming few days. In the meantime, the department is trying to convince the contractors to open their vends, said Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-liquor-contractors-shut-vends-as-govt-fails-to-provide-relief/story-pZvvvTrTNjjvvJpcfA231O.html

24-05-2020||City||It still remains a wonderful life!||One of the most iconic feel good films of all times is Frank Capra’s 1946 release, It’s a Wonderful Life, starring James Stewart and Donna Reed. Several generations of viewers have found their lives elevated just by watching it. Legend has it that a Canadian judge let off a man who had attempted suicide, but ordered him to go and watch the film! We all know that very often it is the company that a human being keeps and the ideas which are fed into his mind which influence his mindset deeply.The reason why I bring this up is that depression and loneliness are making their presence felt like never before in these Covid inflicted times. Mental illnesses had already been on the rise globally in recent years. One reason is that people are prone to spending more screen time than family time. The pandemic has unfortunately exacerbated the situation and added the element of fear to the minds of the already stressed-out populace.Thus, with news trickling in, of each tragic death due to the virus or in the case of returning migrants in road accidents, the collective mood further plummets. Human lives are precious and until a vaccine is found for this diabolical unseen enemy, we have every reason to be on tenterhooks. But some people are clearly more impacted mentally, than others, whenever negative news reaches their ears or eyes. They plunge, sometimes hopelessly so, into the abyss of depression. Perpetrators of fake news and spreaders of gloom-filled rumours must really be taken to task for worsening the already sullen social atmosphere. Children and the elderly especially need to receive positive vibes from family members who should know better than to keep affirming bad news repeatedly.We are, of course, in the midst of a global ‘war’, the likes of which human history has seldom witnessed. Yet, there are signs that the world is concurrently improving in multiple ways. Doctors and nurses have displayed exemplary fortitude and valour to combat the disease. Police officials and sanitary staff have buckled down to do their stuff without fuss. Government officials, often reviled for their lethargy, have rolled up their sleeves and worked tirelessly to perform their duties. Meanwhile, our defence forces deployed at the border have carried on defending the nation with determination, grit, courage and sacrifice. All such human beings are outdoing themselves in the midst of this crisis and inspiring the rest of us to do our bit, in our own little ways.As previously discussed in this column, the earth’s environment has made a spectacular comeback, with the world having remained largely closed for many weeks and with carbon emissions at their lowest. Pollution related ailments have declined dramatically, and thousands of lives have actually been saved as a result of the improved air quality index. And since automobiles first started zooming on our roads, road accident numbers are currently at their all time lowest. During the lockdown, families have found time for each other as never before, discovering new joys together that would otherwise have remained elusive in their usually frenetic lives. Stories of hope, love, bonding and motivation during the pandemic have reached us from the shores of many lands, often making us smile, even if we become teary eyed while reading them.“There are two types of people in this world”, said Tuco, played magnificently by Eli Wallach, in another classic Hollywood film, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Let us not be the type of people who contribute to negative vibrations, by continually cribbing, criticising and complaining. Those who know better, especially parents, must ensure that growing children are adorned with personas which are permeated with positivity and compassion.The swallow is a bird which has forever been associated with joy and hope. Aristotle famously said. “One swallow does not a summer make!” The year 2020 has been written off by many. But today, when the skies are azure once more, one never knows, a flock of swallows may fly past and actually make our summer. In positivity is embedded hope, for mankind. It is, after all, and despite everything, still a wonderful life.vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/it-still-remains-a-wonderful-life/story-OxVVxYIjfaS8Rp1zQe1NwI.html
24-05-2020||City||Wildbuzz| Nature answers a prayer from the heart||You seek the bird, the bird seeks you. No finer an evidence of this birding adage could be imagined than what presented itself to a bird-loving household of Mohali. Shruti Sunny and her husband, Sandeep Singh, along with their son, Sahir, aged a mere 3.5 years, had planned a trip to Dehradun for photographing birds. High on their priority list was the migratory Indian Blue robin that flies back to the Himalayas after spending winter in peninsular India. The couple had received information that the robin comes to Dehradun around the middle of April and spends a few days before mounting an ascent to higher altitudes for the nesting season.However, their trip got cancelled due to the Covid-19 lockdown, as was the case with other tricity birders who had planned similar excursions for early summer. One fine day, cooped up in their Mohali house, Sandeep noticed a wary bird skirting around their garden patch. They initially thought it was a Grey bushchat or an Indian pitta but a photograph revealed it to be none other than the migratory robin! The God of Nature had answered their prayers and dispatched the robin to their doorstep!To lend perspective to the robin’s rarity and the sheer coincidence of it landing in a bird-lovers’ garden, Shruti’s photograph is the first such record of this species from the tricity and only the second record from the broader Inter-State Capital Region (ISCR), encompassing a region falling within a 40 km radius from Chandigarh. The first photographic record of this robin from the ISCR was from Chakki Modh by Kuldip Jaswal on May 7, 2018.Luck and perseverance have brought Shruti, a homemaker, rich birding dividends. In just three years of bird photography, she has bagged two new species for the ISCR (Brown bullfinch and Collared owlet) along with the first robin photograph for the tricity. The total number of bird species recorded in Chandigarh currently stands close to 450 though the updated checklist of the Chandigarh Bird Club is at 432 as it has yet to include some authentic records such as those registered by Shruti. RAIDER OF THE NECTAR TRAINAs the weather warms up, our garden has bloomed with orange tubular flowers very rich in nectar. The resident Purple sunbird family spends most of its time sipping nectar from this particular flower and the fledglings are brought straight to this flowering vine upon leaving the nest. A host of insect species slip up and down the welcoming aisles of the soft orange petals to sip the sweetness of a ripe summer. But there are hunters, too, lurking in the proverbial shadows of exquisite beauty and natural harmony.A Crab spider (family: Thomisidae) prowls around the entrance to the tubular flowers and monitors the steady stream of nectar lovers. I was able to capture on camera the spider preying upon a Hover fly. While devouring the fly, the spider would kick out with its legs in irritation when ants streaming down the tube of petals to the nectar disturbed the hunter’s task and heckled the predator.The sweetest moment came after the spider had fully ingested the fly. Having possibly let out a satisfied burp, the spider turned attention to its larger surroundings and realised that a suspicious-looking object (the camera) was hovering close by! So, the spider promptly slipped out of the tube of petals and hid behind the fold of a petal opening outwards. From there, the spider kept a watch on the camera by peering from behind the petal like a little boy just having managed to stand on his toes and look over the boundary wall of an orchard brimming with beckoning mangoes and litchis. The eyes reflected the lure but mirrored, too, the hesitation and dangers of slipping over the wall to the forbidden fruits. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nature-answers-a-prayer-from-the-heart/story-GNTYrkJqK6uVgN3BqGV44K.html
24-05-2020||City||Lalitas & Lollitas of Lockdown 4.0||If Alfred Hitchcock’s Rear Window had the fortune to be remade in India Quarantining, it would perhaps be titled Rear Vehra (verandah). Instead of James Stewart, it would star next door’s golu-molu Gupta ji or Sharma ji – crippled not by legs that are plastered but by luxuriantly-haired legs caged by Lockdown – doing the sleuthing about neighbourhood doings or misdoings from their rear verandah. Yes, yes, one has to confess, the comparison of the Khullarjis or Khannajis to Stewart is as odious as likening karelas to exotic kiwis.Or if one be partial to spirits, nah not the spiritedness spilling from diabetic Khannajis and Khullarjis (K&K) as they keep count of cups of sugar-loaded tea consumed on neighbouring balconies or count of cup sizes of female laundry fluttering next-door – but if the partiality be to spirits that spark riots outside liquor vends when Lockdown lifts, then comparing K&Ks to Stewart at Lockdown’s Rear Window is like seeing cousinly resemblance between desi thharra and Sauvignon Blanc.If balconies are India Quarantining’s new Mall Lounges or Living Rooms – be it as a stage for the revival of the Great Evening Tea Ritual or for hosting Taali ‘n’ Thaali theatrics – it is these facades of middle class cramped condo living that are mirroring most the little lifting of Lockdown 4.0.Rear Window OneThese balconies stand like solitary outposts of India Quarantining. All that flutters like flags in the summer breeze is a confluence of clothing that bespeaks middle class India’s “andar ki baat” as well as its surface sartorial story – Laundry of Lockdown.Come the little lifting of Lockdown 4.0, those outposts now boast of two “Ls” – Laundry and Lalitas. The former unmasks the “vest”-ed interests of middle class India, the latter flaunts new normal’s multi-purpose masked face. Multipurpose, because the masks serve a dual purpose – they shield from viruses and also save the memsahib from seeing Lalita’s face screwed into a scowl at the sight of scrubbing.The two “Ls” on Lockdown’s balconies are also a metaphor for the paradigm shift in the “breaking news” boisterousness on Tamasha TV and Twitter – with Arnab, Rajdeep & Co’s “flatten the curve” narratives now rubbing shoulders with “Amphan flattens Bengal” new narratives.The curious case of Lockdown’s Life of Bai.Rear Window TwoThis is the Rear Window that’s seeing death – nah, not the toll from the pandemic, but of a ritual. The little lifting of Lockdown 4.0 is seeing the demise of Quarantine’s Great Indian Evening Tea Ritual, which witnessed a revival during #WorkFromHome, quite like discarded ‘n’ dusty gramophones or transistors springing to life if iPods or iPhones were to be banned.What does one blame it on? Park street. For, most of middle class India Quarantining that had parked itself in the Rear Vehra, is now returning to the park.Quarantine’s Great Evening Tea Ritual Revivalists, who were given to lolling their legs or l-ogling lissome legs leaning from Rear Vehras nextdoor, are now legging it to parks to stretch a leg or two.These beyond-Lockdown balconies found echoes in Tamasha TV footage legging it to beyond-Covid19 narratives, Left, Right and Amphan epicentre.The curious case of Lockdown’s Tea Tradition tottering on its last legs upon bone china, not owing to China.Rear Window 3This is the Rear Vehra that’s not experiencing earth-shaking makeover in Lockdown 4.0.Still no signs of Lalitas, only ‘Lollitas’. Nah, no resemblance to the fabled ‘Lolita’, rather ‘Lollitas’ being creatures of Quarantine – #WFH memsahibs who derive their nomenclature from #NewNormal’s behavioural disorder of “lolling” around laptop in one hand and balancing broomstick in the other.These balconies are still staging Quarantine’s Quick Workouts, as the inmates aren’t yet legging it to park street. While the Lollitajis do the balancing act with broomsticks, their respective Khannajis and Khullarjis exercise neck muscles – by leaning over ledges to l-ogle or learn about neighbours’ political leanings. The leanings being configured from the count of candles lit or not lit next-doors upon Narendra Modi’s candlelight call.The single-point agenda of these balcony gazers too finds resonance in the rhetoricism of Pashas of Primetime, who played up only one party’s version of the Yogi vs Priyanka pandemic posturing.The curious case of the leaning towers of pandemic.chetnakeer@yahoo.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lalitas-lollitas-of-lockdown-4-0/story-2dBhN3irsCC7pONk4Roi8N.html

The CM said, “This is your state and you are a part of it. It is vital for the industry to function to ensure livelihood.”“Of those migrants who had applied for online registration, nearly half had willingly decided to stay back and work in the industry,” said the CM, adding that of the total 2.56 lakh industries in the state, operations have resumed in 1.5 lakh units.On transportation arrangements for migrants wanting to leave the state, he said, “My government has been facilitating the return of migrants through special trains. Besides, 607 buses were sent to Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Orissa. Around 3.25 lakh of the 13 lakh migrants have returned to their homes on these trains, while 17,000 have returned through buses.”REACHING OUT TO EMBASSIES“The state government is reaching out to embassies of various nations, which are looking to shift their business out of China,”” he said, adding, “The state is in talks with various embassies and offering them all possible support, in terms of land, infrastructure and other facilities. We have written to embassies of various countries and are engaged in talks with Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese embassies in India.”“Given the way we have controlled the situation, we will not need a strict lockdown again,” he said.While replying to questions, the CM said that the decision on opening gyms would be taken after May 31, in line with the Centre’s guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-cm-thanks-migrant-labourers-who-chose-to-stay-back-and-work/story-vIXYv36KUoRsSpmZZ6jkbP.html
24-05-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown helps city breathe easy||Researchers have found that the average concentration of most pollutants in the city’s air fell during the first three phases of the lockdown (from March 25 to May 18). An analysis of pollutant data available from the monitoring stations of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), done by Urbanemissions.info, found that the levels of five out of six pollutants were lower in the last two months, as compared to pre-lockdown levels.Urbanemissions.info, an air pollution research group, studied the concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO) over the 54 days of lockdown, divided into three phases. The first phase of the lockdown was from March 25 to April 14; the second, from April 15 to May 3; and the third, from May 4 to May 17. Levels were compared with a 30-day average (February 20 to March 22) during the pre-lockdown period. While levels for most pollutants dipped, SO2 saw a spike during lockdown.Average levels of PM2.5 — breathable particulate matter of 2.5 micron size or smaller — fell from 45 microgrammes per cubic metre (µg/m3) during pre-lockdown to 27.8 µg/m3 during the first phase and then to 23.3 µg/m3 and 22.6 µg/m3 in second and third phases respectively. A similar trend was observed for CO and O3. The most substantial decline was witnessed for NO2 — produced by burning of coal, oil, and emissions from vehicle — which fell from pre-lockdown levels of 37.5 µg/m3 to 9.8 µg/m3 during the first phase; 7.3 µg/m3 in the second; and rose to 9.8 µg/m3 in the third.Sarath Guttikunda, founder and director, Urbanemissions.info, said, “In Mumbai, most of the traffic was down, which followed up with reduction in dust resuspension. Emissions from the construction sector were not there while residential open waste burning was limited. Light industry operations too were not there while migration of most low-income groups resulted in reduced biofuel emissions from cooking.”However, the levels of SO2 — a colourless gas with pungent odour and taste that causes respiratory diseases such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema — spiked during the lockdown. While it fell from 15.4 µg/m3 pre-lockdown to 12.5 µg/m3 during the first phase, a surge was seen during the second (24.6 µg/m3) and third phases (36.2 µg/m3).“Heavy industries such as power and refineries were operating at reduced capacity. Sulphur is sourced from diesel, coal or heavy fuel oil. Since NO2 did not increase, transport as a source can be excluded, which leaves us with coal-based consumption (like power plants and cooking) or heavy fuel oil (like idling ships) as possible sources,” said Guttikunda. He said more investigation was needed to address the source of higher SO2 in Mumbai’s air during April and May.A marginal spike in PM10 (larger, coarser particles) was witnessed during the third phase of the lockdown. “Small fluctuations are expected because of weather, but do not reflect a discernible change that can be attributed to the phases. At the same time, the tropical cyclone towards the east led to a reduction in moisture over parts of the west coast,” said Guttikunda.Meanwhile, Urbanemissions.info also studied five satellite maps (Sentinel 5P satellite data) for 14-day averages between March 9 and May 18 for NO2 concentration. “Between May 4 and May 18, an increase in emission is being witnessed as lockdown restrictions get loosened,” said Guttikunda. “After May 17, in phase four, a change is being witnessed due to reduced restrictions. We are already witnessing an increase in industrial and vehicular activity in most cities, deteriorating air quality. Cities need to opened up in phased manner to ensure the access to clean air is not lost.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-helps-city-breathe-easy/story-8Q7Dtl1CjZLIv8aTIh42iI.html
24-05-2020||City||A Dalit poet’s ode to migrant labourers, narrated through brush strokes, touches thousands of hearts||Along with the Covid-19 outbreak in India a parallel tale of sorrow is being narrated by migrant labourers walking hundreds or even thousands of miles to return to their homes for the cities they built had no way of sustaining them. This mass exodus with tragic repercussions for many who perished on the way has touched many creative souls. The poet Gulzar described this journey between life and death as the pandemic raged: They will go to die where there is life!Life elsewhereLife indeed was elsewhere for these people whose plight no one understood when the lockdown was announced. People were told to stay at home but these workers who were abandoned overnight by their employers had no home. Hungry, they first ran their own kitchens with meagre provisions, and when everything finished they queued up for charity meals. What could be the way out for them but to walk home even if it meant death?The saga was going on for nearly two months till the government decided to step in and provide them transport and the exodus continues with parents marching with their few belongings, children in tow, tied to suitcases or carried on shoulders. On and on they go with broken slippers discarded and the journey resumed barefoot or discarded plastic bottles tied to their feet. Some walk on barefoot with the burning concrete roads claiming their share of flesh.Dreams die firstThe lost chunk of flesh from an old labourer woman’s bruised foot becomes the metaphor for an artist who paints it live with the recitation of the famous poem by Punjab’s Dalit revolutionary poet Lal Singh Dil. Written in the 1960s it describes a caravan of landless labourers moving on in the evening dusk. The artist, a self-taught painter of Punjab, who has adopted the name of his city as his surname, is Gurpreet Bathinda. His ‘live’ painting has gone viral on social media.Bathinda, who comes from a family of mechanics, chose to be an artist and went about training himself the hard way. Born in 1976, he remembers how he would travel to and from Delhi to see the exhibitions and plays. “This is how I took lessons in painting and much later I obtained degrees in art and history of art”. Talking about this particular painting, Bathinda says: “As I watched the migrant labourers traverse highways, the lines of the famous poem by Dil kept playing on my mind in which he talks about the familiar colours of the evening against which the caravan of landless labourers moves on.”The painter adds that while these times have shone the spotlight on the plight of the labourers, they have always lived like this in poverty, in full public view.People’s poetDil (1943-2007) whose lines accompany the strokes of Bathinda’s brush, was truly a people’s poet. Born in a tanner’s family in Samrala, he was the first in his clan to complete his basic teachers’ training course when he was drawn towards the Naxalite uprising in Punjab. This poem brought him instant literary notice for its authentic portraiture of the lives of labourers: “The long caravan is moving on/ The brave tillers of the land walk away/ Long starved they are leaving/ the land that belongs to another…”Gurpreet says he had heard Dil recite this poem in a documentary on his life and it had touched his heart. “I had not expected the warm response that would come to this live-painting and that it would be shared by lakhs of people. Some friends say that it has been shared without credit to me and my reply is, never mind it is people’s art and belongs to them,” says the artist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/a-dalit-poet-s-ode-to-migrant-labourers-narrated-through-brush-strokes-touches-thousands-of-hearts/story-Iq5k5LQ25ecLij2RKngZ9K.html

The news came to the fore after the passengers shared the same on social media.A report quoting senior railway ministry official in Delhi said, “We have decided to run a few of Shramik trains on diverted routes. Some trains are diverted for Bihar via Rourkela to clear congestion.” Meanwhile, a migrant labourer asked, “Are we on the Bharat Darshan trip?”Pramod Singh Yadav, a relative of passenger in the Shramik Special took to Twitter on Saturday and wrote, “The train had departed from Bandra for Darbhanga at 5.30 pm on May 21. Passengers were clueless about train route. It had reached Kustaur station after it had crossed Rourkela in Odisha earlier in the day. No food except biscuit and water was being served to passengers.”Officials at Darbhanga station confirmed that a train from Mumbai was expected to reach Darbhanga via Jhajha by mid night. On the other hand, East Central Railway (ECR) had tweeted that train number 09259 Bandra-Madhubani Shramik Special will arrive at Madhubani at 11.55pm on May 23.“We boarded the Shramik Special train on May 21 to go back to Darbhanga. However, despite 48 hours of journey we are still nowhere near Bihar. We don`t have anything to eat and there is no water in the train,” said a passenger on phone.Meanwhile, a flurry of messages posted in response to passengers’ queries ended up without much help. In return, the Indian Railway Sewa tweeted: Kindly share the train originating date and time besides current location.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bihar-bound-shramik-train-reaches-odisha-tweets-fly-passengers-left-clueless/story-sMtBUFgavBM4ULpNJ7c9IO.html

24-05-2020||Pune||Our control room for epidemics has been active for the last 11 years, says Dr Amar Fettle||On May 2, the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) lauded the Covid-19 containment strategies and public healthcare system in Kerala which saw the first outbreak of the disease in the country. Speaking to journalists in an online interaction, Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, chief of ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases, said, “Kerala is offering one of the best containment strategies and it is unparalleled. So we will continue to refer to Kerala Model as far as testing and containment strategies are concerned.” As of May 15, the state had reported 587 Covid-19 positive cases, 87 of which were active.On May 11, Dr Amar Fettle, Kerala’s state nodal officer for Covid-19 explained Kerala’s preparedness and strategy during a video interview conducted from Pune. The interview, ‘Behind the Kerala model’ was conducted by Dr Arun Gadre, a gynaecologist and founder-member of Alliance of Doctors for Ethical Healthcare, on behalf of Vicharvedh, a forum for progressive thought in Maharashtra. A senior consultant paediatrician, Dr Fettle has worked on health emergencies in Kerala for the last nine years, including outbreaks and epidemics such as HIV, H1N1, bird flu and Nipah. Within two days, the Union government’s alert was received and the Kerala health authorities began gathering information from various national and international sources.Simultaneously, the state’s healthcare surveillance system was put on alert to look out for respiratory infection, fever, clustering and other symptoms or signals of Covid-19.He noted that the state health department’s control room that had been formed in 2009 to tackle the H1N1 epidemic had been functioning throughout the last 11 years and was once again activated. In the last 11 years, we have formed wonderful teams of district nodal officers and others in the 14 districts of Kerala. They are all young people wanting to do something out of the beaten track,” he said. On January 26, the Kerala Government published the country’s first comprehensive guidelines for coronavirus management. The state took early lead in alerting its airport and seaport health officers and in creating a system of screening, surveillance, transport to hospital and isolation centres at its four airports itself.The control room was expanded and 18 sub-divisons created to deal with procurement of medical equipment, surveillance, lab testing, documentation, media management, monitoring of rumour mongering on social media, infrastructure development, human resources development, recruitment, public media management and ambulance transportation.Dr Fettle said principal health secretary Dr Rajan Khobragade and the minister of health and family welfare KK Shailaja Teacher, along with the health secretary would sit with them in the control room to deal with the situation. The team prepared the worst-case scenarios and developed guidelines for each of them. He gave a detailed account of how the state dealt with India’s first case of Covid-19-- a student who had returned from China-- that was detected in Trichur district. A robust ‘Disha’ telephone helpline which handled more than one lakh calls, training for a total of 8.5 lakh people from all sectors, including the police, and 24x7 telephonic psychological counselling by more than 2,000 counsellors were part of the preparedness, he said. Effective contact tracing using innovative route maps, the wholehearted participation of the field public health staff and volunteers was very effective in handling the crisis. Two days before the national lockdown on March 24, Kerala had its own statewide curfew when food and rations was delivered for the elderly who were living aloneThe state also had effective home quarantine where only one person was allowed to stay at home and he was given moral support by the neighbours. We call our migrant labourers ‘Guest Workers’Dr Fettle said that Kerala calls its migrant labourers as ‘Guest Workers’ and not as ‘people from other states’ or ‘aliens’. “We have guest worker colonies and employment camps where they live and our guidelines and communication was translated into five-six languages such as Oriya, Bengali, Tamil and Telgu. Our language experts created these spoken and written guidelines which was available on social media and they also communicated with them.” They were provided with food and payment for loss of labour, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/our-control-room-for-epidemics-has-been-active-for-the-last-11-years/story-KDnEIr6pRXvYHRyv8zN4iI.html

A senior consultant paediatrician, Dr Fettle has worked on health emergencies in Kerala for the last nine years, including outbreaks and epidemics such as HIV, H1N1, bird flu and Nipah. He spoke at length during a recent video interview conducted from Pune on the highly acclaimed ‘Kerala Model’ through which the Covid-19 pandemic has been brought under control in Kerala. The interview, ‘Behind the Kerala model’ was conducted by Dr Arun Gadre, a gynaecologist and founder-member of Alliance of Doctors for Ethical Healthcare, on behalf of Vicharvedh, a forum for progressive thought in Maharashtra. During the one-hour interview which has been uploaded on YouTube, Dr Fettle urged the public not to underestimate the virus and suggested a series of simple steps and strategies to ensure that people and their families stayed free from the infection. Here are some of the key points from that interview:•Use masks when you step out of the house: When you step out of the house, imagine that pink and green viruses floating all over the place and on all kinds of surfaces- cars, shop counters. Keeping that in mind, always use a simple face mask. Remember that the virus will not come to your house on its own, unless you bring it. To avoid this hospitality, put on the mask every time you leave the house. Wash your hands with soap every time you leave the house and enter. Sanitise your hands every time you leave shops, banks, offices. Wash your hands again and again till you are bored…•Wash your feet after coming from outside- let’s return to the old Indian culture•Keep social distance in public places. If someone is not following it, tell them politely and in a friendly way; but don’t take the law into your own hands.•Take care of the elderly and those who have conditions like diabetes and keep them safe.•Teach children ‘cough hygiene’; the use of handkerchief and not spitting in public•Listen only to medical experts, scientists and obey the guidelines issued by the government and the local authority rather than following social media. •Maintain general health to build immunity and eat healthy foods; fruits and vegetables, leafy vegetables•Do not go to hospitals for small illnesses, but consult your doctor on the phone. •Ensure enough sleep and peace of mind. Do not monitor TV news for the latest on Covid-19 and get alarmed.•Be alert about your own safety; that of your family, your neighbour; your friends who are in contact with you and your helpers such as housemaids and driver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/do-not-invite-the-virus-home-kerala-s-covid-19-expert-tells-audience-in-pune/story-lLnGTTRMNG9EEUSoMbtrDK.html
24-05-2020||City||Covid effect: No chhabeel stalls in Ludhiana this year||With mercury touching 42.6 degree Celsius in the city, something has stayed amiss for commuters braving the blistering summer wave — chhabeel, the chilled sweetened drink served at stalls by gurdwaras and social workers.Serving chhabeel along the roadside during summers is an age-old tradition associated with the fifth Sikh guru, Guru Arjan Dev. This year, the guru’s martrydom day will be observed on May 26, but it is for the first time that neither gurdwaras nor social workers are setting up chhabeel stalls, courtesy the fear of spread of coronavirus.Prithvipal Singh, 58, of Chander Nagar, is one of the many social workers had been setting up stalls of chhabeel every summer from mid-May to June-end for the past 40 years. “There used to be a huge rush of commuters at the stalls. Children travelling back home after school in buses, rickshaw-pullers and auto drivers used to have chilled water from the stalss to beat the heat. It is for the first time I will not be serving chhabeel to avoid the spread of the virus. Nothing is the same this year,” he said. For a rickshaw puller, Hari Om, 46, it is difficult to commute amid the sweltering heat. “Earlier, we used to get chhabeel stalls in every area but these days we cannot even find clean water to drink. I had filled a water bottle to carry with me this morning, but by afternoon, this water became too hot to drink. Some shopkeepers help by refilling the bottle, but some just insist on buying one, which I have to,” he said.CHANGING TIMESDue to coronavirus, the guru’s martyrdom day will not be observed the same way in gurdwaras like it used to be. Management committees of some gurdwaras in the city have decided not to serve langar.However, Inderjit Singh from the management committee of Gurdwara Singh Sabha, Model Town Extension, said that considering the safety of residents not more than 50 devotees will be allowed to sit in the prayer hall at a time. Proper social distancing will be followed, said Singh, adding that this year, no chhabeel will be served and langar will be distributed to the devotees in packets. However, Jaspal Singh Thukral from Gurdwara Singh Sabha, Sarabha Nagar, said they will serve chhabeel but only to the devotees visiting the gurdwara, but not in the open. “Further, the langar hall is being properly sanitised daily and volunteers (sewadars) are provided masks and gloves to prepare langar,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-effect-no-chhabeel-stalls-in-ludhiana-to-provide-reprieve-from-sweltering-heat/story-UgzQwszsJgJYF3qyPyWAgO.html
24-05-2020||Pune||Pune to get additional 2,000 beds from private hospitals for Covid patients||Following Maharashtra government’s order to take control of 80 per cent of total beds in the private hospitals, the number of beds for Covid-19 (coronavirus) patients in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad is likely to increase substantially that will help the civic administration deal with the growing number of patients.According to Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, after the government decided to regulate 80 per cent beds in private hospitals, the capacity is likely to be increased by 2,000 in the city. In Pimpri-Chinchwad, at least 800 more beds are likely to be added, said a civic official from Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC).“The additional capacity of beds with ventilators and oxygen will help us fight against Covid-19 even if the number of patients grows at current pace till August,” said Gaikwad.It was on Friday that the state government decided to take charge of 80 per cent of total operational beds in private hospitals. The Pune district administration held a meeting in this regard on Saturday with private hospitals in which they were apprised about the decision.“Representatives from around 60 hospitals having more than 100 beds attended the meeting. During the meeting the hospital representatives raised some issues about which the administration has promised them to address,” said Deepak Mhaisekar, Pune divisional commissioner after the meeting.According to Mhaisekar, as per existing capacity, Pune currently has 8,982 beds of which 459 are ventilator beds, 1,736 are with oxygen supply and 860 with ICU facilities. In Pimpri-Chinchwad, there are around a total of 3,469 beds currently available.These additional beds from private hospitals, according to district collector Naval Kishore Ram, will be used for tertiary treatment. “They will boost our capacity further,” said Ram, who was part of the meeting Besides taking charge of 80 per cent hospitals, the government has capped treatment cost to lowest rates applicable while also invoking Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act (Mesma). “For the rest of 20 per cent beds, hospitals will be free to apply their rates,” said Mhaisekar.Dist admin to expedite land acquisition process Amid lockdown, the Pune district administration has decided to expedite the land acquisition process for major projects in the city as well as district.According to district collector Naval Kishore Ram, he has asked all the concerned officials to resume the process of acquiring land for projects such as Metro rail, Bhama Askhed pipeline, Palkhi Marg road widening and other civic work in the city.“These are all important projects and directions have been given to officials to complete compensation disbursement and other aspects as early as possible,” said Ram on Saturday a day after his meeting with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar when the latter took a review of various projects including Covid-related preparations in the district.According to a senior official, through expediting land acquisition, the administration wants to resume work to employ workers as lockdown had stalled most project making many jobless.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-to-get-additional-2-000-beds-from-private-hospitals-for-covid-patients/story-82COEilIHGAheWmnOvEOfO.html

According to experts, the gaping difference in the requirement of health infrastructure versus the increasing patients will add to the civic body’s troubles. As per the Covid-19 dashboard report prepared by the Smart City war room, the estimated projection is calculated on the assumption of average growth of 2.19 from the last seven days before May 21 wherein the doubling rate of positive cases is 14 days. The estimated number of cases is rising drastically putting pressure on the existing health infrastructure which has led the state government to take over about 80 per cent of the beds in charitable hospitals for Covid-19 patients. As per the report by May 28, the city will have 5,317 progressive positive cases, by June 3 this will rise to 6,963 cases, by June 17 cases will go up to 12, 896 and by June 30 this figure will rise to 22,940 progressive positive cases.Ramchandra Hankare, chief medical officer, PMC, said, “Going by the current rate, there may be a shortage of ventilators and ICU beds which are required for critical patients. Even though the progressive count may be over 22,000, but the active cases load would be around 9,700.”“We are in the process of taking over the beds at private hospitals as per the state government resolution (GR) for which we will have a meeting with the private hospitals. By taking over the beds at private hospitals we will not face scarcity of ventilators and ICU beds even if the cases reach those numbers,” he said. As of May 18, the civic body has 48 Covid-19 dedicated facilities which have 9,850 isolation beds, 3,539 isolation beds without O2, 2,122 isolation beds with O2, 271 ICU beds and 137 ventilators. For every one ventilator, the PMC has two ICU beds. Dr Abhijit More, public health expert said, “The state government’s order has come at the right time and so if the private hospitals cooperate well, this shortage can be managed very well.”“On the other hand, the PMC is now failing at managing non-Covid-19 patients and they are being ignored. A lot of their OPDs are shut and they are recruiting doctors for just 45 days and asking nurses to deposit a month’s pay. At the current situation anyone coming forward to work in the health sector is in itself a courageous thing to do,” said Dr More.“Even if PMC fills in its own vacant posts a lot of shortage of manpower will be fulfilled. Even in these times PMC’s largest hospital, Kamala Nehru hospital does not have a functioning ICU facility, which in itself is a serious issue,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-estimates-22k-positive-cases-by-june-end-stares-at-shortage-of-icu-beds-ventilators/story-UU3IQxVZNlIsc5Lo87RIIN.html

24-05-2020||Mumbai||15,000 school bus staffers staring at loss of jobs||With almost all schools moving to online classes due to the Covid-19 outbreak, nearly 15,000 school bus staffers across the city are staring at losing their jobs. In a statement released late on Friday, the School Bus Owners Association (SBOA) said it has no other option but to let go off the bus staff as bus owners are not being paid by schools and parents. “We are seeing really tough times with schools being shut for so many months. Schools have refused to pay bus owners saying that parents are not paying fees for buses as they are not using the bus service. This has left thousands of bus owners in a lurch as there is nothing we can do to retain our staff if the situation remains like this,” said Anil Garg, president of SBOA. In Mumbai and elsewhere in Maharashtra, schools have been shut since mid-March due to the Covid-19 pandemic. With schools affiliated to the CBSE and ICSE boards beginning their new academic year in April, many schools started their new sessions online and allowed parents to make partial payment of fees as per a government resolution mandating the same. Garg said the government needs to give some support to the bus owners and staff members to bring them out of this situation. “There are over 2 lakh people in the state who are dependent on these buses for their livelihoods. Many owners have taken loans to buy buses and haven’t been able to pay their loan instalments. The situation can be brought under some control if the government intervenes and gives some relief,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/15-000-school-bus-staffers-staring-at-loss-of-jobs/story-y334YUv2jf37cqTJ1y9yqK.html

According to animal activists, foreign dog breeds like dobermans, labradors, German shepherds and golden retrievers have been seen roaming on the city streets without food and shelter. “We have rescued more than 20 foreign breed dogs from the streets during the lockdown period,” said Vineeta Tandon, co-founder and trustee, Animal Rescue Trust.“Recently in Sangvi, a nine-year-old golden retriever was found with a note around his neck where his (dog’s) details and our Trust’s number was written. The dog is currently with a girl who contacted us and now, we will bring the dog to the shelter,” added Tandon whose shelter is located in Manjri.The government had issued guidelines as dogs and cats do not transmit the virus, but still many people carry misconceptions, said activists.“Awareness is still required among people. At Manjri and Hinjewadi, Covid-19 awareness flexes suggest keeping dogs and cats at bay during this pandemic. I complained about these flexes to the people responsible and got the pictures of pets and the misinformation removed,” added Tandon.Animal Adoption and Rescue Team (AART) members, who have been patrolling the city streets, have also noticed a rise in the number of abandoned dogs in the last 60 days of the lockdown.According to Ajay Pujar, senior volunteer, Animal Adoption and Rescue Team, many foreign breed dogs were seen on the streets in the last two months which is not common. “Our volunteers are working in all the areas and once we get to know about such dogs, our van picks the dog and it is transferred to the shelter,” said Pujar.“Many students who have left for their hometowns due to the lockdown have abandoned their dogs so we are rescuing them as well,” added Pujar.Feed animalsAnimal welfare groups from the city – AART (Animal Adoption and Rescue Team) and DAWG (Deccan Animal Welfare Group) have appealed to residents to join in the cause of feeding street animals.

24-05-2020||Mumbai||MVA govt-Koshyari tussle on: Guv objects to recommendation to cancel final-year varsity exams||The tussle between governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MBA) government is likely to continue as Koshyari on Friday took strong objections to the the state’s recommendation to the University Grants Council (UGC) to cancel final year examinations of the students. State higher and technical education minister Uday Samant made the suggestion in view of the Covid-19 outbreak in Maharashtra.Koshyari has asked chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to resolve the issue of conducting final year examination of students of the universities in the state ‘without any further delay in the larger interest of students’.Samant, however, questioned the Governor’s demand, which he said came after the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) — a student’s outfit linked to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) — supported holding examinations. “In Goa, ABVP demanded cancellation of examinations and in Maharashtra they want examinations to be held. What kind of politics is this?” Samant said.According to a press release issued by Raj Bhavan, Koshyari said the minister’s intervention was ‘unwarranted’ and has violated the UGC guidelines and also the relevant provisions of the Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016.“Not conducting final year examinations…amounts to breach of UGC guidelines,” Koshyari wrote in a letter to the chief minister. The governor has further said he was not apprised about the matter before the minister recommended the same to UGC.Koshyari said, “Students receiving degrees without undertaking examinations would have adverse impact on their higher studies, gradation and employability.” He also pointed out that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has granted exemption from lockdown measures to state education boards as well as CBSE and ICSE boards to conduct Class 10 and 12 examinations. “I have not taken any decision in this regard. Only directives have been sought from UGC over cancellation of final year examination of universities. I have also opined in the letter that it would be better to cancel the examinations considering the rising Covid-19 cases. Being a minister, I can share my views with the UGC. What is wrong in it?” said Samant. There has been a tussle between the governor and the MVA government for a while now. Koshyari did not take any decision on the state Cabinet’s request to him to nominate Uddhav Thackeray as an MLC as it was necessary for a chief minister to get elected from either of the two Houses of the state legislature within six months to keep his chair. Before that, Koshyari also did not appoint NCP leaders — Shivajirao Garje and Aditi Nalawade — as members of the state legislative council despite recommendation from the chief minister in December last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mva-govt-koshyari-tussle-on-guv-objects-to-recommendation-to-cancel-final-year-varsity-exams/story-mdrArfct1IZvHKIqtoc23H.html
