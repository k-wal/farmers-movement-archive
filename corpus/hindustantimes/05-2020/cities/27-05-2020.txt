On Wednesday, the city recorded 1,044 new cases of Covid-19 cases and 32 new deaths, taking the total number of cases in the city to 34,018, and deaths to 1,097. Mumbai now accounts for 62.99% of all Covid-positive cases in Maharashtra and 57.82% of all deaths due to Covid-19 in the state.Sero-surveillance in Mumbai is expected to help determine the spread of Covid-19 in the general population and their exposure to the infection. The result of the survey will help determine guidelines to prevent and control the spread of Covid-19 in high-risk areas.There are 24,507 active cases of Covid-19 in Mumbai, and 8,408 patients have recovered so far. Mumbai’s mortality rate stands at 3.22%. At present, the city accounts for 65.99% of Maharashtra’s active Covid-19 cases.Five clusters have been randomly identified for ICMR’s survey: Kandivli (West) and Kandivli (East), Dharavi, Deonar, Kurla, and Sakinaka. The survey will collect blood samples from individuals in randomly-selected households and test them for Covid antibodies. Presence of antibodies in the blood is a sign of exposure to the virus. This will be done after taking patients’ consent and their detailed history. Five hundred individuals from these five clusters will be selected for the survey in Mumbai.On Wednesday, Dharavi saw a dip in the number of new cases, reporting 18 new cases after recording higher numbers for the past few days (38 new cases were reported on Tuesday; 42 on Monday, and 27 on Sunday). Assistant commissioner of the G (North) ward, which has jurisdiction over Dharavi, Kiran Dighavkar said, “The last time number of cases were in the teen figures was April 18, when Dharavi had reported 16 new cases. Then the total number of cases in Dharavi was 117.”The total number of Covid-positive in Dharavi is 1,639, of which 946 are active. As of Wednesday, 41.8% of Dharavi’s total cases have been cured and discharged.As of Wednesday, there are 689 containment zones in the city, and 2,908 sealed buildings. There are 16,719 high-risk contacts quarantined in Covid care centres-1.About 75% of the total 18,142 beds available for Covid-19 patients are occupied as of May 25. These beds include oxygen beds, beds in intensive care units, ventilator beds, dedicated Covid hospital beds, dedicated Covid health centre beds, and beds in Covid care centres-2, which are for mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Of the total 4,116 oxygen beds, 63% are occupied. Of the 644 beds in ICUs, 96% are occupied and 66% of the 359 ventilator beds are occupied.BMC is also setting up an online portal that will be accessible to doctors who want to check the availability of dialysis beds in the city for confirmed and suspected Covid-19 patients. Comorbidity is one of the main factors contributing to mortality in Covid-19 patients and patients who need dialysis are among the most vulnerable. At present, there are 92 dialysis beds for such patients, according to BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/icmr-puts-mumbai-on-list-of-cities-to-undergo-blood-surveillance-to-check-exposure-to-virus/story-SXRN7EhXsyCOALOPkEbPmL.html

27-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC hikes stipend of 300 PG doctors from ₹14K to ₹54K||After delaying the decision for months, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has increased the stipend of almost 300 post-graduation doctors from College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS), who are on Covid-19 duty at the civic hospitals, from Rs 14,000 to Rs 54,000. For over two months, these resident doctors from CPS have been stationed at the Covid-19 ward in Dr RN Cooper Municipal General Hospital in Vile Parle. Though they have been managing the hospital wards with medical students from civic-run hospitals and working similar hours, CPS students were paid much lower than the BMC post-graduate students. “We are getting Rs 14,000 whereas, the BMC doctors get Rs 54,000 for doing the same amount of work. We are risking our lives to provide treatment to Covid-19 patients. So, why this discrimination?” said a post-graduation student from Cooper Association of Resident Doctors (CARD). After several complaints, the civic body on Wednesday agreed and promised to pay Rs 54,000 to the students. Amay Ghole, chairman of public health committee, BMC, said, “We have raised the stipend amount to Rs 54,000. All the 300 doctors from CPS will get the raised amount from next month.”Month-old cured of Covid-19A month-old child was cured of Covid-19 at the Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital, also known as Sion Hospital, and returned home on Wednesday. As per the information received from the hospital, on May 19, the infant was rushed to the hospital as he had fever and stiffness in the body. A swab test confirmed the presence of Sars-Cov-2-- the virus that causes Covid-19. “Within five days, the child turned negative for the virus. Other than his parents, the medical staffers also cheered for him,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of the hospital. Presently, there are 455 Covid patients at the hospital. The hospital has successfully conducted over 150 deliveries of Covid-infected mothers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-hikes-stipend-of-300-pg-doctors-from-14k-to-54k/story-6p8VkCuFv6I31P0aAHyWmM.html
27-05-2020||City||Covid set to transform our lifestyle ‘for a long time’||Let’s do a fast forward. The watchman of your favourite eatery that finally opened after months greets you as you alight from your car. But he greets you from a distance and as you come close he subjects you to a rather cold thermal scan!“Welcome sir, we have intimation of your pre-booked slot,” he tells you from behind his face mask, after dutifully spraying the sanitiser on your hands and clothes.In no time, your meal is served with masked and gloved waiters hovering around.On the table, a bottle of sanitiser is a reminder of the mask-sanitiser-social distancing drill that is going to be part of our lives at least till the coronavirus vaccine is ready.And, yes, no leisurely binging, for sometime at least. Because, you could well be trespassing on someone else’s slot. In any case, the waiter will remind you with, “Sir, 10 minutes left!” type reminder about the arrival of new slot-takers.Right! So you had ordered some packing too. On your way out, you could collect the parcel which has been passed through a UV (ultra violet) ray chamber to ensure cleanliness!Seems far-fetched? Well, ask Nittin (he goes by one name), founder and chef Pack-N-Chew restaurant who is getting ready for just such a change.“It’s clear that post lockdown phase, we are all in for a major change in the way we approach things,” Nittin said, adding the dining out model was set to undergo a metamorphosis.Many like Nittin are also diversifying into food retail business ostensibly to make up for revenue hit which almost all food businesses are preparing for. ICONIC EATERIES WAIT FOR GOVT NODAt least one prominent five star is looking to revive its mobile food truck which it had used during launch, say sources in the hotel industry. Some others are planning to modify existing spaces to introduce pre-sanitisation areas and ensure social distancing.Not all are poised to change, though. Some, like two prominent bar-restarurants, fearing major dip in revenue, are looking to shut shop.And owner of many iconic eateries, like Mohd Usman of Tundey Kebabs, say they are staring at an uncertain future. Rahim’s Kulche Naharis and Mubin’s Pasanda kebabs are just as uncertain because the owners of these usually crammed eateries too are looking for directions from the government to resume business.“We don’t really have a clue so far on how to open up. As of now, we aren’t getting supplies and our workers too have left for their homes. Let’s see what is in store,” said Mohd Usman.WHAT ABOUT KHOMCHE WALLA!The food business in Lucknow is huge with nearly 5,000 plus small and big listed restaurants.This is not to add hundreds of ‘khomche wallas’, the roadside vendors, the local chaat walas who made a living by selling cheaply priced stuff popular among the masses. “It’s not clear if we will be able to do business as before because in our stalls, social distancing isn’t possible. Even if we were to somehow ensure that, then sanitisation issue would come up. And there would be ambiguity on whether or not we can serve anyone turning up with cold,” said Rajat Kumar, a chaat-seller in Chinhat.FSSAI GUIDELINESThe Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has already issued a detailed safety and hygiene guidelines for food businesses during Covid-19 pandemic.These guidelines, among other things, state buffet system should be disallowed. “These services would resume only under directions from concerned authorities,” reads one of the points in the elaborate guideline.“We aren’t yet sure how we are going to operate. We are waiting for the government to clear the air,” a restaurant owner with a popular buffet service said. LIFE IN FOR A MAJOR SPIN Yes! Life is in for a major spin.The laidback ‘Lakhnawi’ who would engage in friendly banter over smoke rings and endless tea from the neighbourhood chai walla, and those kitty party women who would chatter away their afternoons in restaurants, those carefree gorging on golgappas and those ‘mehfils’ (meetings) where the poetic minded would share poetry sipping the heady brew ... All of it is going to change. Many have already taken to virtual platforms to share poetry, craft and cuisine.The UP government has in any case banned big meetings till June 30 and it’s increasingly certain that social distancing would be here to stay for a while.So even a regular walk to your neighbour medical store will change,as ‘over the counter’ sale of regular drugs for fever, cold and cough would be subjected to scrutiny and details. In fact everything, from gyms to morning walks at favourite parks, are on hold. THE DOCTORS Sitting alone in his chamber at the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) Dr Anand Mishra, the head of the department of endocrinology, is engaged in preparing for post corona lockdown phase.Many of his breast cancer patients whom he had operated upon come to him for regular check-up. However, he hadn’t been able to do that out of their fear of contracting coronavirus infection on travelling down to KGMU.That’s when he thought of connecting with them virtually.The first virtual meeting of his breast cancer survivor support group was a hit with patients connecting with him from all over the state. “The practice run was successful. Nearly 50 of my patients, from various parts of the state connected with me to share their developments and concerns. My breast cancer support group also helps in allaying fears of those who may have been freshly diagnosed and fear the worst. So this support group also mentors new patients,” Dr Mishra said.“Now, hat I tried and it worked, my patients can connect with me virtually. Hence now onwards, I plan to put in place a regular system of virtual screening. This would continue post lockdown for coronavirus isn’t going away anytime soon,” he said.At the other end of the state capital, Dr Rajat Dikshit, a private medical practitioner with a large patient base, is readying to resume his private clinic in Kasaibada locality near Latouche Road.He has ordered a face-shield, apron and head cover for himself. He would get his private clinic sanitised daily with sodium hypochlorite and all patients reporting symptoms of high fever, cold and cough would be referred to fever clinic.“All patients walking in to my clinic would also have to fill up a form giving their basic details, their travel history, if they are symptomatic among other things. There are many patients who aren’t getting advice and treatment and for these patients I have decided to resume clinic but yes, we all have to undertake precautions,” he said.At Health City, Dr Vaibhav Khanna and his team of doctors have already put in place a regular drill, mandatory screening of all patients for Covid-19 who walk in at the private nursing home.YOGIC POSES Sudhir Sharma, who runs the city’s oldest Yoga centre opposite the Hanuman Setu, is busy devising ways to regulate the flow of yoga-learners at his centre.“We will have all our yogic drills wearing masks. The people will have to come at a pre-booked time slot and maintain social distancing. In pranayaam, the key yogic breathing exercises, masks would have to be done away with. But that we would have in a separate room, with participants sitting opposite each other for the purpose,” he says, adding ‘home delivery’ of yoga would also be promoted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-set-to-transform-our-lifestyle-for-a-long-time/story-L0ME88S7rNAE2Fd5Ux2cCI.html

After testing positive, he was shifted to a hotel in Kurla from his residence in Ghatkopar’s Asalpha. He was discharged two weeks later on May 22 when his superiors told him to take another 14 days rest. But Shinde did not want to do that.Shinde, who is to retire on May 31, wanted to spend his last few days at work in the city’s iconic red bus where he worked for 31 years. “I requested my superiors to let me resume on duty. I would have been really disappointed if I did not get a chance to retire while I was on duty,” said Shinde, who will be resuming work on Thursday at 5.30 am at the Marol depot, where he was posted for the last three decades. He was working at the depot till May 5 before testing positive.While he has worked as a conductor for the most part of his service, he was promoted as a ticket-checker in 2013. Shinde developed a fever on May 7. He was advised to get tested the next day when he and his wife, 54-year-old Heena Shinde also tested positive. “I was really scared. My wife was admitted to the hospital and I was quarantined in a hotel,” Shinde said. Till date, more than 160 BEST employees have been tested positive, of which more than 100 have recovered, however, nine employees have died. Those who retire from the BEST service are usually felicitated at the depot on the last day but Shinde said he would miss out on that owing to the lockdown. Rajendra Madne, additional general manager, BEST said, “Be it terror attacks, floods or a pandemic, BEST has employees like Shinde who are completely dedicated to their job. He has four days left to retire but he still wants to work for those four days. The younger generation must learn from people like him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ht-salutes-best-employee-defeats-covid-19-resumes-duty-4-days-before-retirement/story-EuuE9NCgngxOLykz2TzznJ.html
27-05-2020||Lucknow||CEPC to organise fairs to attract domestic market||Carpet Export Promotion Council (CEPC) president Siddhanath Singh that CEPC would seek business opportunities in domestic market to save the livelihood of the weavers and artisans in view of Covid-19 pandemic.Singh said that it would take at least 6-9 months to re-start the export as major carpet buyers like USA and Europe suffered badly due to the pandemic and so it was important to attract domestic market. He said that he had held discussions with union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on May 26 in this connection.The Minister said that as part of its efforts to explore business in domestic market, the CEPC was planning to organise carpet fairs in all four metros—Delhi, Mumubai, Chennai and Kolkata— and major cities like Chandigarh, Shimla, Amritsar, Puna, Ranchi among others. In the fairs, hand woven carpets of all ranges would be made available, he informed and added that a meeting would be held in June for discussing date and schedule of the series of carpet fairs. If all remained well, the first carpet fair would be held in mid or later part of September, he stated.Singh said that he had demanded imposition of 200 percent import duty on machine made carpets, being imported from Belgium, Turkey and China. He has also written to union minister of commerce and industry in this regard.Singh said that virtual fairs were also on the cards for the international buyers and made an appeal to domestic carpet buyers to buy handmade carpets.Around 4 lakh weavers are involved in carpet weaving in Bhadohi, Mirzapur and their adjoining areas in eastern UP. On an average, a weaver earns around Rs 300 daily if he works for seven to eight hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/cepc-to-organise-fairs-to-attract-domestic-market/story-6a7FIj5NgaaqqWhasjI8AL.html
27-05-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government plans to reduce premiums, speed up approval for realty projects||To provide respite to the real estate sector which is currently taking a beating due to the Covid-19 lockdown, the state government has announced plans to reduce the tax and premiums on realty projects as well as speed up approval processes.State housing minister Jitendra Awhad on Tuesday said the state will take all steps to help the real estate sector. “The premiums will be reduced but how much will be decided later,” said Awhad, adding that the approval process needs to be expedited. “We are planning a system where all approvals are granted within one month. Even if there are some issues, provisional permission will be granted so that the work begins,” he added.Builders had previously complained that the premiums charged by the local bodies, especially the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), are too high and contribute to an increase in the final price of the apartment, which is ultimately borne by the homebuyer. Besides, it takes years to get approvals and these delays result in an exponential increase in the project cost. Successive governments have tried various methods to curtail the approval processing time but were unable to succeed much.Builders and the housing activists have welcomed this latest move by the Maharashtra government.Harish Jain, vice-president, BrihanMumbai Developers Association (BDA) said such measures are needed to lift the real estate sector which is currently in bad shape. “Such steps will help to kick-start the projects and also spur housing demand,” said Jain.Housing activist Ramesh Prabhu, however, said that mere announcements will not be enough. “We need actual implementation and not mere slogans. The officials simply delay the process on flimsy grounds. Unless [decisive] steps are taken, the realty sector cannot be revived,” said Prabhu.The real estate sector has been in a slowdown since the last few years. Builders raised their prices, forcing buyers to postpone purchase plans. Now, the Covid-19 lockdown has complicated matters further.BOXA survey conducted by the Maharashtra Chambers of Housing Industry (MCHI-CREDAI) noted that 60% of builders expect business to get back to normal within nine to 12 months after the Covid-19 lockdown is lifted and 83% of respondents said they will continue with their real estate business. Around 45% said they are ready to acquire properties if the pricing is attractive.The survey was based on responses of 500 builders who have projects in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-plans-to-reduce-premiums-speed-up-approval-for-realty-projects/story-8CA3HsIJpxs3yjZbMKIIUI.html
27-05-2020||Mumbai||Can Pawar-Thackeray tide over this crisis too?||Last year, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray pulled off a coup when they put together an unexpected coalition of three parties and snatched power from the BJP after 2019 Assembly elections. They also managed to run the government smoothly for the past six months. Now, as Maharashtra is struggling to handle the pandemic, the duo faces the challenge of not only controlling the health crisis, but also bringing the state’s economy back on track. And if that is not enough, the current developments have led to speculation over political uncertainty in the state. The two leaders also have some differences over the issue of lifting the lockdown, especially in Mumbai, the financial capital of India.Pawar, who was the architect of the coalition, managed to convince the Congress leadership to support a Shiv Sena government. He also ensured that the coalition is led by Uddhav Thackeray, as the cabinet comprised several political heavyweights. Thackeray who never held any public office handled the job of chief minister without much trouble for six months and managed to handle the diverse coalition. The Covid-19 epidemic, however, has led to a health and economic crisis in the state and has become a tough challenge not just for him.Maharashtra has the highest nunber of Covid-19 cases in the country. Till Wednesday, the Covid-19 case count was 56,948 with 1,897 deaths. Mumbai is the most affected city with 34,018 cases and 1,097 deaths.State health officials say they are expecting the cases to increase further in June. The state may cross 1the -lakh mark next month. Preparing for this situation is a tough task for Thackeray and his government. The state does not have adequate health infrastructure if the number shoots up further.“This would have been difficult even for an experienced chief minister due to the unprecedented nature of the crisis. Thackeray had never handled any public office before he became the chief minister. As such, Pawar has been guiding him,” said a senior NCP minister who did not want to be named. “Since he took initiative to form this government, Pawar will have to step in if the crisis is affecting the state badly and it seems like he has been doing it,” said political analyst Hemant Desai.In the past few days, Pawar has met Thackeray thrice and held discussions on handling the crisis. The duo, however, has different opinions over exiting the lockdown which is in effect in the state. According to MVA ministers, Pawar is keen on reopening the city as early as possible, but Thackeray is apprehensive that there could be spike in cases if lockdown is lifted entirely in affected areas. Mumbai can’t be kept shut for a long time as it will badly affect the city and state’s economy, Pawar has apparently pointed this out. After all, Pawar knows this better than anybody else. In March 1993, following serial bomb blasts in Mumbai, there were apprehensions that life in the city would not normalise soon. However, Pawar who was then the chief minister of the state, ensured the share market and other financial institutions were reopened within 2-3 days.Thackeray’s overdependence on bureaucracy, too, is not going down well with the alliance partners. “Thackeray will have to now take a call whether to continue with the lockdown in June or whether to lift the restrictions. He is reluctant, but he will start reopening cities in a staggered manner,” said a Congress minister.However, the developments in the past few days, which saw Pawar meeting Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari (the two reportedly spoke about the state’s response to Covid-19 crisis) and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, making it clear that his party is not a decision-maker in the MVA government has raised doubts over future of the government.“Pawar meeting Governor Koshyari was a courtesy call. It was also to reduce the tension between the state and Central governments. You can’t handle the ongoing crisis without help from the Centre,” said a senior Shiv Sena leader. Desai does not see any chances of trouble between Pawar and Thackeray and also between the MVA partners. “To end speculations over the government’s future, they put up a united front by holding a meeting of three parties. Their priority will be to handle the crisis and not switch political sides. Nobody knows this better than Pawar,”said Desai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/can-pawar-thackeray-tide-over-this-crisis-too/story-2bgYXEcQBMFEo8FBtSNrAL.html
27-05-2020||Mumbai||MVA: Devendra Fadnavis’s ₹28,000-cr aid figure imaginary||Putting up a united front, ministers of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Wednesday punctured holes into the claims made by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, terming the ₹28,000-crore Central aid mentioned by him an “imaginary figure”.Leader of Opposition Fadnavis had on Tuesday attacked the Uddhav Thackeray-led government over claims that the Centre was biased against Maharashtra and had not given it enough assistance to tackle the pandemic.Ministers from the three parties – Shiv Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) – addressed a joint conference to put to rest speculation of disagreements and lack of coordination in the ruling coalition.On Wednesday morning, it was announced that state transport minister Anil Parab would address a press conference. However, Patil and Thorat joined the conference after a meeting of MVA ministers at Varsha bungalow. Patil clarified, “We [Thorat and Patil] were out of Mumbai, so our names were not announced till we were available.” Thorat said, “We are working together to combat the crisis today under the leadership of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar. Everybody is working in coordination and have taken measures for patients, migrants, industries etc.”Shiv Sena’s Parab rebutted each point raised by Fadnavis and said that he had misled people by saying that the Centre is giving full support to the Maharashtra government. The minister said the state has only got ₹6,649 crore through various schemes from the Centre and not ₹28,000 crore as claimed by the former CM.Parab said Maharashtra has not got wheat under the PM Gram Kalyan Yojana. “The decision to provide wheat, dal and rice was taken for the entire country, not just for Maharashtra. Fadnavis said that wheat worth ₹1,750 crore has been given to Maharashtra, but the state has not received wheat at all.”He lashed out at Union railway minister Piyush Goyal saying the ministry sent trains at once to paint a picture that Maharashtra is unable to send back migrants. He added that the state spent money on all Shramik trains through the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. “Goyal alleges the trains are sent back empty, but the railways has changed the train schedule to create confusion and just gave us a one-hour notice before the departure. Everything was going well, but a confusing situation is being created to defame the state government,” Parab said. Patil said the Centre had not provided enough personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, N95 masks and gloves to the state. He also claimed the Centre had first claimed it would pay for it, but the state has spent from its funds. “We asked for 49 lakh masks, but received around 13 lakh; we asked for 17 lakh PPE kits, but till May 21, we got zero. We asked for 25 lakh gloves, but we received only 28,000. We got zero ventilators. We are not criticising the Centre, but Fadnavis should support the government, not criticise or destabilise it. The BJP is nowhere to be seen in the work we are doing and the state will remember it.”Fadnavis responded to the press conference, in a live video, calling it “incomplete” information. “The food grain at ₹2 and ₹3 are part of the Central scheme, so how can they claim they have not got wheat. They claim that they have not govt PPE kits, but the Centre has a dashboard for it. As on May 26, 9.88 lakh PPE kits and 16 lakh N95 masks have been given. They said they are purchasing it, but they forgot to add that the Centre has given ₹486 crore for it,” he shot back.Patil took a “strong objection” to Fadnavis’s statement that the economy would be hit as migrants have left for their home states. “He has underestimated the skill of people of Maharashtra. Does it also mean that he has no trust in PM Modi’s Skill India programme,” he said. In response, Fadnavis said that he was talking about skilled jobs and not unskilled labourers. “Jobs like diamond-cutting cannot be learnt in one day by any worker from any state,” he said.Patil said the government has been successful in keeping the numbers lower than what the Central team had projected. He said that the situation in Maharashtra is way better than in Gujarat, which had a much higher death rate. Fadnavis slammed the government over this. “The state has over 30% of the total cases, 40% of the total deaths, but the government is patting its own back instead of telling people what they would do to provide more hospital beds,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mva-devendra-fadnavis-s-28-000-cr-aid-figure-imaginary/story-m1lqVHZZOV1tkoD1SYVyXL.html
27-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Engineering College students stuck in Germany to be evacuated on Friday||As many as 14 students of the Panjab Engineering College (PEC) who were interning in Germany and got stuck there due to international flights being suspended amid the Covid-19 pandemic, will be brought back to India in an Air India flight on Friday.PEC director Dheeraj Sanghi said, “Some students had gone there to complete their sixth semester. They contacted me and said they want to come back fearing the present global scenario.”“Earlier, only students coming back to Chandigarh were being accepted into the flight as the evacuation is being done location-wise. After that, we wrote to the Indian Embassy and UT administration and asked if students can fill in PEC’s hostels as their addresses. Then, the students were accepted for evacuation,” Sanghi said.Father of 20-year-old Gurpreet Singh, Bhag Singh Kairon, said his son went to KIT Germany in January to complete his sixth semester of industrial training.“However, within two months, the situation across the globe deteriorated amid the Covid-19 pandemic and international flights were suspended,” he said.“The internship was supposed to end in July. However, we decided to ask our son to come back as soon as international flights resume. The university also co-operated and completed their training by May 25. On Wednesday, they were given all documentary proof and certification,” Kairon said.The students will board the Air India flight from Germany to India on Friday. The flight will land in Delhi following which they will be given an option to quarantine in locations specified by the UT administration.Germany is one of the worst-hit countries by the pandemic with over 1.8 lakh cases reported so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-engineering-college-students-stuck-in-germany-to-be-evacuated-on-friday/story-WfWcYvnEjwBjxbbgI3V8RP.html
27-05-2020||Mumbai||HC lets minor rape survivor terminate her 23-week foetus||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday allowed a 13-year-old rape survivor to terminate her 23-week pregnancy, which resulted from the attack by her father.A division bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice NR Borkar allowed the petition filed by the mother of the minor, primarily in view of the report of the medical board at Sir JJ Group of Hospitals.The board examined the girl on May 23, according to earlier orders of the court, and submitted its report recommending medical termination of the minor’s unwanted pregnancy.“Continuation of pregnancy in the minor may lead to pregnancy-related complications like anaemia, pregnancy-induced hypertension as well as and complications during labour,” said the medical board in its report. “It will also have a psychological impact on the pregnant minor with an uncertain future. Hence it is advisable to terminate the pregnancy at any convenient hospital of her choice.”In view of the opinion of the medical board, the bench said it would be necessary to permit the medical termination of pregnancy. The court thus allowed the minor to terminate her unwanted pregnancy at Sir JJ Group of Hospitals.The court has also directed the state-run hospital to preserve the blood and tissue samples of the foetus to carry out necessary medical tests, including DNA fingerprinting, to be used in the rape case. The investigating officer of the case has been directed to ensure that the samples are forwarded to the forensic science laboratory for analysis and preserved for trial.According to the petition filed by the minor’s mother, the teenager was sexually abused by her father while she was residing with her aunt at Thane, resulting in her pregnancy. On May 17, a first information report (FIR) was registered with Thane Nagar police station. Two days later, the minor underwent a sonography which revealed that she was 22-weeks pregnant.The survivor’s mother filed the petition seeking the high court’s permission for termination of the unwanted pregnancy, as under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, medical termination of pregnancy is not allowed beyond 20 weeks gestational period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-lets-minor-rape-survivor-terminate-her-23-week-foetus/story-uB50G5iKCt0LjH1Et2Cw4O.html
27-05-2020||Mumbai||Rahul Gandhi, Uddhav Thackeray speak amid ‘rift’ buzz||Wednesday saw hectic political activity to end the speculation over stability of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.A day after his comment that the “Congress was only supporting the government and was not a key decision-maker in the ruling coalition”, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi spoke with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray over the phone and expressed solidarity with the government. Thackeray, too, assured him the Congress was an equally important coalition partner. Soon after, key ministers from the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi – Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress – held a joint marathon meeting at the chief minister’s official bungalow, Varsha.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar chaired the meeting, which was attended by senior ministers Jayant Patil, Subhash Desai, Balasaheb Thorat, Anil Parab, Varsha Gaikwad and Aslam Shaikh. CM Thackeray did not attend the meeting. Later, the three parties put up a united front with revenue minister and state Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat, water resources minister and state NCP chief Jayant Patil and parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab (Shiv Sena) addressing a press conference to reply to the allegations made by Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday.Gandhi had, in a press conference on Tuesday, compared the party’s governments in Punjab, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and said there was a difference between running a government and supporting it. It had set the rumour mills abuzz and also upset the other ruling partners, pushing Shiv Sena and Congress leaders into damage-control mode.“Sena MP Sanjay Raut spoke to Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala, after which a call was arranged between Gandhi and Sena minister and CM’s son Aaditya Thackeray on Tuesday evening. This was followed by the call between Thackeray and Gandhi on Wednesday morning,” a senior Congress leader said. According to MVA insiders, Gandhi told Thackeray that his government was doing a good job to combat the pandemic, despite the difficulties the state was facing. “The air was cleared over the speculation after Gandhiji’s statement in the press conference. The Congress leader clarified his statement was blown out of proportion,” a Shiv Sena leader said. Gandhi also explained his stance, maintaining how he has been categorically stating how important Maharashtra is and it should be given more importance in the fight against Covid-19. In the MVA meeting which lasted for three hours, the leaders discussed various issues, including the strategy for gradual lifting of the lockdown and preparations to combat Covid-19 in Mumbai. “Chief secretary Ajoy Mehta and other officers made a presentation on the current status of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai and other parts. We discussed the strategy for gradual relaxation of lockdown in red zones after May 31 and narrowing down the size of containment zones further. A few more commercial activities are likely to be allowed in cities like Mumbai from next week,” said Shaikh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rahul-gandhi-uddhav-thackeray-speak-amid-rift-buzz/story-iZkyyHGHKpyIy7asN8y2GK.html

27-05-2020||Mumbai||Locust swarm splits into two; fourth district in state gets hit||The locust swarm that entered Maharashtra earlier this week made its way to Bhandara on Wednesday, making it the fourth district to be affected.After pesticide was sprayed at Katol tehsil in Nagpur between Monday night and Tuesday morning, the swarm split into two groups; one moving towards Parseoni in Nagpur while the other entered Bhandara, said officials.At 10pm Wednesday, officials from the agricultural department were able to trace the movement of the locust swarm to Temani village, Tumsar taluka in Bhandara. “The swarm travelled over 100km on Wednesday from Andhalgaon, Mohadi taluka back into Ramtek tehsil in Nagpur, and again into Tumsar Bhandara. They have settled at orchards surrounding Temani where we will carry out overnight insecticide spraying drive to kill majority of the population,” said Ravindra Bhosale, divisional joint director agriculture.“The original distribution of the main 10-km-long and 2-km-wide swarm has reduced. We are facing trouble estimating exact numbers or current length of the swarms without satellite data since they move very fast,” said Bhosale.The state agriculture department issued a ‘locust warning alert’ for all 11 districts in Vidarbha and four districts in north Maharashtra — Nandurbar, Dhule, Nashik and Jalgaon — to keep a lookout for locusts near farmlands, take preventive measures, and inform state authorities, said officials. A similar advisory was issued by the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) agromet division for Vidarbha. “Large scale damage to fruit orchards is being expected across affected districts, and farmers need to take care,” said an IMD official.The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates the swarms can be as many as 40 to 80 million. However, the Locust Warning Organisation (LWO) said the escaping population that entered Maharashtra would not be more than 5 million.Along with five other states, Maharashtra is witnessing a surge of rapidly reproducing crop munching pests that can fly up to 150km a day and has the potential to impact food production. The swarm has invaded farmlands and fruit orchards across two talukas in Amravati, one in Wardha, and four in Nagpur till Wednesday morning. “By afternoon, we were informed that the swarm had entered Bhandara district near Andhalgaon in Mohadi taluka,” said Bhosale, who is in-charge of six Vidarbha districts. Containment efforts with the help from fire department were carried out at Parseoni on Tuesday night, he added.So far, control operations have been carried out across 85 hectares (ha) — 50 ha in Nagpur and 35 ha in Amravati. “As the swarm settles atop trees at night, we are using pesticide solution of 2.4 millilitres of Chlorpyrifos (pesticide) per litre of water or 1,200 ml of the pesticide in 500 litres of water to be sprayed across one hectare area,” said Subhash Nagare, divisional joint director agriculture and in-charge of remaining five Vidarbha districts.Meanwhile, agricultural department has asked orange and mango orchard owners in Vidarbha to use noise and smoke to drive away the pests. “Farmers have been banging steel utensils within their orchards, forcing the short horned grasshoppers to rush to adjoining fields. Other measures include lighting small fires emanating voluminous smoke and spraying neem-based pesticides,” said Nagare.Camera traps at Powai to track leopard movementThe Mumbai forest range and wildlife NGOs have set up camera traps to check the presence of suspected leopard movement at an apartment complex in Raheja Vihar in Powai. While residents said they spotted a leopard at the society, the forest department said there was no proof of the animal’s presence. “Leopard movement has not been observed in the past in this area. Along with conducting an awareness drive to ensure residents feel safe, the camera trap images will give us an exact idea,” said Jitendra Ramgaonkar, deputy conservator of forest, Thane.Two weather systems in Arabian Sea, no warnings for Mumbai as of now: IMD The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Wednesday clarified that two weather systems in the Arabian Sea would not be affecting Mumbai as of now. An existing cyclonic circulation over south west Arabian Sea is likely to concentrate into a depression in the same region. However, a second system formation is expected around May 30 towards south east Arabian Sea which is likely to be a low pressure area. However, no warnings have been issued by IMD yet as officials said the development of the system needs to be observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/locust-swarm-splits-into-two-fourth-district-in-state-gets-hit/story-SR4AW8MjlrBjMHe1IKOMiI.html

27-05-2020||Mumbai||City’s Covid growth rate 6.6%, but five areas see 10% rise daily||While the growth rate of Covid-19 is 6.6% in the city on an average, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has identified five neighbourhoods — Ghatkopar, Mulund, Bhandup, Vikhroli, Goregaon and Kandivli — where the daily growth rate is 10% or more as of May 22.BMC’s weekly data shows hotspots like Dharavi, Worli, Byculla, Mazgaon, Kurla, Bandra (East) are showing a slower growth rate (4%-7%). Areas with growth rates higher than 8% are termed high-risk, BMC officials said.High-risk areas include P (North) ward (Malad) where the growth rate is 11.9%; P (South) ward (Goregaon), where the growth rate is 10.9%; R (Central) ward (Borivli) where the growth rate is 8.9%; and R (South) (Kandivli) where the growth rate is 9.4%.In the eastern suburbs, N ward (Ghatkopar) has the highest growth rate (13.7%) followed by T ward (Mulund, 11.9%). F (South) Ward in central Mumbai (Parel, Lalbaug, Sewri) has a growth rate of 8.2%.When asked about the high growth rate in Borivli and Kandivli, deputy municipal commissioner Vishwas Shankarwar said, “We have a higher growth rate than others also because our cases are fewer. Our increase is reflected faster in terms of percentage owing to the smaller number when compared to areas with more cases. However, we are adopting all measures to contain the spread, especially in slums, by rigorous contact tracing.”Some corporators have recommended sealing slums. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator from Goregaon, Sandeep Patel said, “No matter how much we try, the slums will remain a challenge. I feel all the slums should be sealed, irrespective of there being cases or not.” BJP Corporator Nehal Shah said, “They [BMC] should have sealed all slums in the beginning and should have tested for cases within the area.”Explaining Ghatkopar’s high growth rate of 13.7%, assistant municipal commissioner of N ward, Ajitkumar Ambi said, “There were several people who were getting tested by private laboratories without showing any symptoms. Due to this, the [number of] cases went up. We have to do focused testing now and cannot test everyone, considering the testing guidelines expected to be followed. The growth rate has come down compared to last week. Also, in government staff quarters, people are working and stepping out. Hence the chances of getting the virus increase. It is not that cases are coming only from slums, but also [residential] societies and high-rises.”Kishore Gandhi, assistant municipal commissioner of T ward, said citizens observing lockdown guidelines had brought Covid-19’s growth rate down in his area. “Our growth rate was 11% on May 22, but it has now come down to 8%. We have contained the spread in the slums by quarantining maximum possible high-risk contacts. However, the numbers now are increasing and we are getting cases from non-slum areas, from high-rises. There is no strategy but to implement the knockdown efficiently,” said Gandhi.Public health consultant Dr Sanjay Pattiwar said, “Containing virus in densely-populated areas like slums is a very difficult task, but the only thing that will help is to institutionally quarantine a maximum number of citizens from these areas. We cannot have movement in Mumbai like earlier until a vaccine is available. However, we can classify who can go out until then.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-s-covid-growth-rate-6-6-but-five-areas-see-10-rise-daily/story-i5ESM0hBsxAdvxaDE1oQ8H.html

Whereas other companies are refunding the money in their own wallet to customers. Now Indigo has also started refunding in our agency wallet balance, which we can use for buying fresh tickets with Indigo, so we are refunding money to customers in their bank account.

27-05-2020||Lucknow||UP: Mango growers fear extensive losses||As the threat of desert locusts hovers over Uttar Pradesh, anxiety has gripped the mango growers in Malihabad . Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture (CISH) officials said if locusts attacked the mango crop, which was expected to hit the market from June 1, it would be destroyed completely.The agriculture department has stationed around 16 tractor -mounted pesticide sprayers at border areas and 12 technicians and more than 5,000 locals in the area, armed with drums, plates and other noise making utensils to scare away the locusts.CP Srivastava, deputy director agriculture, Lucknow said, “Desert locust attack is expected in Kanpur. It totally depends upon the wind direction. If it heads towards Lucknow, the locusts will come along. However, we have made elaborate arrangements in Malihabad, Mall and Kakori. Also we have deputed tractor-mounted sprayers on the borders to spray pesticides and also roped in locals and villagers to scare away the locusts.”“There seems no relief for us. First the yield was much less than expectation, then came corona, followed by lockdown and now the locust attack. We don’t have any option than to watch our crops being destroyed,” said Mohammed Miyan, headman of Mujasa village in Malihabad, a part of mango belt in the state capital.The mango belt here comprises Malihabad, Mall and Kakori tehsils.. “In all three tehsils, the records of the horticulture department suggest mango is produced on 23,589 hectares of land. Malihabad is said to be the largest contributor to the total mango production (from the mango belt) with over 10,000 hectares of land under mango farming,” said Insram Ali, president of All India Mango Growers Association. “This is a very crucial time for the mango crop since it is all set to hit the market. If any such attack occurs, it will totally destroy the crop,” said Ali.It would be a double whammy for the mango growers already facing the brunt of the lockdown. “In UP, every year, the mango growers exported around 10 tonnes of Dussehri mangoes to the Gulf countries but this year due to lockdown there are no buyers from abroad,” he added.Dr Shailendra Rajan, director, ICAR-Central Institute for Subtropical Horticulture (CISH) that aims to train the farmers in getting maximum yield said, “If desert locusts attack the mango belt they would surely destroy the crop set to hit the market. This is a peculiar situation never seen before.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-mango-growers-fear-extensive-losses/story-i4c78XiNF1ZyOgdVcpTKgL.html

The minor boy then called the 7 others who helped him beat Vannale to death, according to a complaint lodged by the deceased man’s father.When asked if the two families had known each other, PSI Gurjar said, “We cannot confirm that right now but the houses are located far away. Therefore, it does not seem likely.”A complaint in the matter was lodged by police naik Ajit Magdum of Yerawada police station who was present when stones were thrown at a relative’s house of the minor in Panchsheel nagar.A case under sections 143, 147, 148, 149, 188 and 427 of Indian penal code was registered at Yerawada police station against the attackers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mourners-booked-for-attacking-house-of-accused-minor-s-relative/story-Y13SLKSs3jxcEo0fttq6jJ.html

27-05-2020||Gurugram||Frequent power outages in rising heat make life difficult for city residents||With the mercury touching 45.5 degrees Celsius (˚C), the demand for power has gone up in Gurumgram, but so have the complaints of power outages and volage fluctuations.The problem is made more acute with children and senior citizens being forced to stay indoors due to the lockdown.In sector 46, residents said power supply has been erratic and that the existing power distribution infrastructure was inadequate to withstand the load. “There is frequent tripping of transformers, sometimes the power cables snapped and the residents are suffering. The government should privatize the power supply system as there is no solution to these issues,” said RK Yadav, president, sector 46 residents’ welfare association.Residents of sector 7, Mollahera sector 49, DLF phase 3, sector 14, sector 15, sector 17, sector 57, sector 31, Palam Vihar and other parts of the city also complained of frequent outages.HS Nanda, president, sector-14 RWA said: “People can’t go out (due to lockdown) and daily power cuts of up to 3 to 4 hours is making life insufferable.”Power utility company Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) that supplies to 500,000 consumers in the city, said that it had received around 1200 to 1300 complaints and that the situation was more or less under control. “There is no unscheduled power cut from feeders and supply is normal. If there is any problem it happens at local level due to snapping of a cable or a fuse but our teams are continuously working to rectify the problem,” said KC Aggarwal, chief engineer, DHBVN.  Haryana Power DISCOMs (Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam and Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam) have introduced the facility of trust reading for consumers to help rectify wrong meter readings in electricity bill, consumers can get the bill fixed by providing correct meter reading online. For this facility, the consumers will have to visit the Nigam’s website www.uhbvn.org.in or www.dhbvn.org.in. All information about the use of this facility is also available on the websites of the DISCOMs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/frequent-power-outages-in-rising-heat-make-life-difficult-for-city-residents/story-lVAdYLkxdqAoSGOcdPLPSK.html
27-05-2020||Gurugram||Lockdown threatens existence of single screen cinemas||The Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant lockdown imposed to curb the virus has sounded a possible death knell for single screen cinemas of Gurugram, which are taking heavy monetary losses. Though the government has eased out restrictions considerably in the fourth phase of the lockdown — that will end on May 31 — a ban on opening of cinema halls and theatres remains.Theatre owners and administrators said that while single-screen cinemas had stopped being profitable with the arrival of multiplexes, the lockdown had dried up even their meagre earnings and exacerbated losses.A decade ago, Gurugram had six single-screen cinemas of which only two survive today — Payal and Raj. A third one, Shakuntala, has not been running for several years now. While both Payal and Raj had been running in losses and struggling to stay afloat as multiplexes mushroomed, the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown could prove to be the last nail in the coffin for these cinemas.Bhanu Pratap Singh, who has been managing affairs at Raj Cinema for the past 20 years, said that the lockdown had added to the losses of theatres which were already struggling. “One has to pay for electricity and other routine activities. People working here have to be paid salaries. We have three people working for us in different capacities. Two of them are still around, while one has gone back to his hometown due to the lockdown,” said Singh. He added that employees were being paid during the lockdown, with concessions, considering the current financial situation. “The operator and the cleaners are permanent employees, who need to be paid,” he said. Singh said that on routine days, the revenue earned would be used for paying the salaries of employees and some other costs, but with that drying up, the losses were mounting with no relief in sight. Singh said that so far, the plan was to see how the situation develops once lockdown restrictions on cinema halls are lifted. Besides the financial loss, the loss of audience was a major cause of concern. “The plan is to run the theatre like before, once the lockdown ends. We were in losses earlier as well. This time, however, we have lost our audience as well. We will have to assess the situation, since people who usually watch films here are mostly migrant workers who have gone back to their hometowns,” said Singh.Payal cinema in sector 14 has also been shut since the lockdown began. Rameshwar Dayal, manager, Payal cinema, said that a decision on running the theatre would be taken by the owners, once lockdown restrictions are lifted. “Single screen cinema theatres were never making profits, but with the lockdown, even the meagre earnings have dried up. Guards and cleaners need to be paid for their services. The expenses continue as before and the losses are just adding up now,” said Dayal.The exodus of workers from the city is also likely to have a massive impact on the theatre’s future, he added. “We are not sure if and how the theatre will work post the lockdown. Our audience usually comprises labourers and with most of them going back to their hometowns, we are uncertain about the future,” said Dayal. He said that bouncing back might take many months, since cinemas were the first to shut down and might be the last ones to open.Joginder Kalra, one of the owners of Shakuntala Cinema, a single-screen theatre that stopped operations a decade ago, said single-screen cinemas had no or little earnings and the only way of survival was converting them into a multiplex. “Single screen cinemas don’t have an income source. They were running as a formality before the lockdown. Now, the losses will only multiply,” said Kalra. He added that single-screen cinemas can change into three-four screens cinema to keep with the changing times. Kalra said he has applied for the conversion of Shakuntala into a multiplex and the process was underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/lockdown-threatens-existence-of-single-screen-cinemas/story-dtI4BY0FoeVr4kTECYkPmK.html

27-05-2020||Gurugram||State prepared to meet locust threat: Agriculture minister||The Haryana agriculture department is working in close collaboration with local panchayats and farmers to ensure that the locusts that have entered some areas of neighbouring Punjab and Rajasthan don’t cause damage to the crops in the state. Emergency response teams have been formed and seven districts bordering Rajasthan have been put on alert to meet any situation, state agriculture minister Jai Prakash Dalal said.The locusts fly in large swarms and feed voraciously on crops and vegetation in large areas. The threat posed by locusts in Gurugram is less as there is no standing crop in the district, local agriculture officials said, adding that preventive measures have been put in place. The officials of the Locust Warning Organisation based in Faridabad also said that there was no threat of swarms entering Delhi on Wednesday as these were moving towards Dausa, Karauli and Dholpur in RajasthanThe state agriculture department, Dalal said, has been preparing for this threat since January as advisories and warnings regarding desert locusts were received much earlier. “We have alerted seven districts that border Rajasthan—Rewari, Mahendergarh, Sirsa, Fatehabad, Charkhi Dadri, Bhiwani and Hisar—and asked the local administrations to take preventive measures and keep a close watch on the situation,” he said.The minister said that guidelines have been issued to local functionaries, tractor spray machines deployed, meetings held with farmers and the areas in which the likely spread can take place mapped. “We can’t stop the locusts from entering the state but by working on the ground, we can ensure that the damaged is prevented by spraying insecticides and taking other measures. Agriculture officers are collaborating with local farmers and have formed groups at the local level and supplied them with an adequate amount of insecticide to neutralise the locusts. We are closely monitoring the situation as well,” he said.The cotton crop spread over 50,000 to 60,000 acres in the districts neighbouring Rajasthan is under threat because of the locust swarms, officials said. As per the latest information shared by an official of the Locust Warning Organisation based in Faridabad, the locust swarms are moving towards Dausa, Karauli and Dholpur in Rajasthan and there is no threat to Delhi as of now, an official said.Dr KL Gurjar, deputy director, directorate of plant protection, quarantine and storage, Faridabad, tweeted, “There is no possibility of reaching locust swarm in New Delhi upto 4 pm today as stated in the news. The swarms are moving towards Dausa, Karauli & Dholpur [sic].”No official from the directorate responded for comment despite repeated calls.The state agriculture department is also in touch with locust control units in the neighbouring states and is keeping a watch on their movement. Since January, the locusts have visited the state twice—once they were spotted in Elanabad and the second time in Loharu, the minister said.Locust swarms have not been witnessed in India in decades. There have been instances of locust breeding at the local level, but they were controlled, agricultural experts said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/state-prepared-to-meet-locust-threat-agriculture-minister/story-jibtr9sFIL9hM5bCoJ6ePL.html
27-05-2020||Chandigarh||MBBS fee in Punjab’s govt colleges hiked 80%||The Punjab cabinet increased the MBBS fee in government and private medical colleges of the state on Wednesday. The fee for the full five-year course in government-run medical colleges from this session will be Rs 7.8 lakh from Rs 4.4 lakh previously (an increase of around 80%).In private medical colleges, the fee for government quota seats has been hiked from Rs 13.4 lakh to Rs 18 lakh (35% increase) for the course. For management quota, the fee is now Rs 47 lakh instead of Rs 40.3 lakh (around 17% increase).“For Adesh institute in Bathinda, the government has decided to decrease the fee, which will be Rs 18 lakh for government quota seats and Rs 47 lakh for other seats. Till now, this institute used to charge Rs 65 lakh per seat for the full course, claiming that it does not come under the state government ambit as its medical college is affiliated with its own university. Now, we have regulated all such institutes,” said state medical education and research minister OP Soni, adding that all private medical colleges will follow this pattern.A spokesperson in the chief minister’s office said the MBSS fee for government medical colleges was last notified in 2015; for private colleges this was done in 2014. He added that with massive surge in costs, colleges were facing fiscal problems and were unable to meet the norms of the Medical Council of India, thus necessitating the fee hike.Rs 51,100 cr package sought from CentreThe cabinet has also sought Rs 51,102 crore from the Centre to help the state tide over the financial crisis due to the pandemic and the lockdown. A draft memorandum to this effect was approved, with the cabinet authorising the CM to make amendments before submission.In addition to direct fiscal stimulus of Rs 21,500 crore, the state plans to seek waiver of long-term Cash Credit Limit (CCL) debt, saying that this was imperative for its fiscal recovery. The draft document also adds that Central schemes should be 100% funded by the Government of India.A spokesperson added that the state also proposes to ask for Rs 6,603 crore for improvement of public health infrastructure in the long-term.To contain the spread of covid-19 in rural areas, ₹5,068 crore has been sought for liquid and solid waste management in villages. Capital outlay and targets under the MGNREGS have also been revised upwards.The state cabinet has also okayed a rural transformation strategy at a cost of Rs 5,655 crore to ensure funds for development of rural infrastructure and individual beneficiaries through convergence of funds under its schemes and programmes, such as the MGNREGS, the Smart Village Campaign, the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awas Yojana (PMAY-G), as also finance commission grants and panchayats’ own money etc.Decision on lockdown on May 30The government will decide on the lockdown in the state on May 30, after the CM chairs a review meeting with all departments on the covid situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mbbs-fee-in-punjab-s-govt-colleges-hiked-80/story-pZfYGhV1ptQjEskFtJ7oZK.html
27-05-2020||City||St Stephen’s teachers allege damage to trees on campus, principal says all rules followed||New Delhi: Thirteen faculty members of Delhi University’s St Stephen’s College on Wednesday said the college administration has violated forest and tree protection law by causing damage to trees during construction activity on campus. The faculty members also filed a complaint with the Delhi forest department.In a letter sent to principal John Verghese on Tuesday, the faculty members, who are also on the panel of college’s governing body (GB), said, “We are shocked and dismayed to find that since 22.05.2020 various arbitrary activities have been carried out apparently on your instructions. A very large portion of the front garden of Teacher’s houses A-15 and A-16 has already been trespassed upon and there is illegal encroachment by the construction workers...The trees inside and outside teachers’ flats A-15 and A-16 have been seriously damaged. These are large ancient trees, part of college heritage and beauty, and a vital part of the green cover of the college.”The principal denied the allegations and said that he had acted in accordance with the college constitution and in response to the approvals sanctioned by the Governing Body. A senior official at the Delhi government’s forest department on Wednesday said that they had received a formal complaint from the teachers’ body of the college seeking action on “encroachment, felling of ancient trees, fences and hedges during construction activity on campus”.“In the inspection carried out at the campus by the tree officers, it was found that at least 10 mature trees of different species were damaged while one full-grown tree was pruned without securing any prior permission for the activity. The nature of the offence is grave. We will write to the police enclosing the complaint and photographs of the area and request them to lodge an FIR in the matter,” said a senior forest officer, who did not wish to be named.The forest officials also said that despite request the college administration did not cooperate with tree officers when they reached the spot for site inspection on Wednesday. The officials said they had to take help from police to enter the college premises. They said there spotted the violations, mentioned above, at the spot. The forest department had not filed any police complaint until late Wednesday night. But the principal said, “There are no arbitrary and illegal actions on the college campus in violation of environmental laws, forest and tree protection laws and the constitution of the college... As part of the relaying of the college roads, it was decided by the college on recommendation of the architect that the existing road at the Allnutt side would be slightly widened in order to comply with the safety precautions and regulations with respect to buildings and roads prescribed by the Municipal Council of Delhi.”Verghese added that Master Plan by the Town Planning Department of the MCD mandates that all internal roads are to be of 6m wide for unrestricted vehicular movement and fire tenders. “Sufficient surface parking needs to be provided to comply with the parking requirements specified by the Town Planning Department of the MCD. As a consequence, the hedges in front of the houses had to be removed and the road slightly widened. I had communicated this matter to all the residents in the area via my email dated 20 May 2020.He said that the college architect had certified that none of these were in violations of the forest laws, the tree protections laws in the directions/ guidelines issued by the Delhi High Court and the National Green Tribunal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/st-stephen-s-teachers-allege-damage-to-trees-on-campus-principal-says-all-rules-followed/story-B5PzeJnEYbdz6N6B36IY1H.html
27-05-2020||Gurugram||Haryana Vision Zero to shut operations due to lack of funds||The Haryana Vision Zero (HVZ), a road safety programme launched in May 2017 to achieve zero road fatalities across the state, has decided to end its operations on May 30, citing lack of funds caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Every year, HVZ would receive a cumulative funding of Rs 3 crore from Honda company and Nagarro as part of corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds. The next batch of funding was to be initiated on May 1 this year, but HVZ officials said that further funding from the two companies was hindered due to the coronavirus outbreak, as a result of which their organisation has to be closed down. When asked, Manas Fuloria, chief executive officer of Nagarro, said, “The funding came up for renewal just when the Covid-19 crisis had started. The economic slowdown plus the uncertainty of when things will return to normal and the programme could restart led us to not renew our commitment. We will be happy to look at it in another avatar, maybe focused on Gurugram this time. Nagarro did not support the programme only monetarily, but also with our time, office space for holding HVZ training sessions, and with some IT and project management.”Representatives from Honda did not respond to requests for comment.The HVZ officials said that they are looking at restarting the programme in the future, but at a smaller scale that will solely focus on the aspect of road safety in the Gurugram district.“We tried our best to continue with the initiative for as long as we could. We will look back at this three-year period with pride as it brought down fatality rates across all parts of Haryana and above all saved lives. We will plan to see how we can reintroduce HVZ in some form or the other in coming time. In the meanwhile, we will continue supporting the state government in implementing the recommendations of the HVZ programme,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, programme coordinator, HVZ.HVZ commenced operations in May 2017, after signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Haryana government. It is loosely based on the principles of the in Sweden’s Vision Zero programme which commenced operations in 1997.Initially, HVZ started with only 10 districts of Haryana and in 2018 expanded to cover all 22 districts in the state.With a team of 27 road safety experts, HVZ audited roads across the state to determine accident-prone stretches, black spots, and engineering defects that were all contributing towards road fatalities. Their audit reports, along with suggestions for executing engineering or infrastructure changes, were subsequently shared during district road safety meetings across all 22 districts in the state in the presence of various stockholders, such as Haryana police, public works department, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), local municipal corporations, and other local agencies for implementation.During its three-year tenure, the total number of road fatalities recorded in Haryana was 5,390 in 2017, 5,356 in 2018, and 5,125 in 2019. Similarly, for Gurugram, the total number of road fatalities was 484 in 2017, 469 in 2018, and 401 in 2019.Additional director general of police (ADGP), law and order, Navdeep Singh Virk, declined to comment on the matter stating that “this was not a police matter and rather was a government issue”.However, the Haryana transport minister, Mool Chand Sharma, said, “We have already asked for a file on HVZ to review its work and see which suggestions of theirs can be implemented in each district. We extend support to all road safety programmes engaged with the state government, especially to those that are making a difference on-ground.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-vision-zero-to-shut-operations-due-to-lack-of-funds/story-1FgDM7Li558tlMSxcysSFL.html
27-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi high court seeks details of steps for hospitalisation of serious Covid-19 cases||Taking suo moto cognisance of a video clip in which a man had alleged that his mother, who was suffering from Covid-19, was asked shift to hospitals, the Delhi high court on Tuesday directed the Centre and the Delhi government to state the arrangements made to deal with serious coronavirus patients who require immediate hospitalisation. The court sought the status of functional and responsive helpline numbers being operated by them, as many of them were said to be found non-functional.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rajnish Bhatnagar said the authorities “should assess the adequacy of the helpline capacity and state whether the same is sufficient to deal with the present call traffic and the traffic expected in the foreseeable future, keeping in view the continuous rise in the number of cases being reported each day”.“In our view, the helpline numbers of the GNCTD should also provide guidance and information to the caller as to which hospital has beds available for the treatment of serious Covid-19 patients — both in government and private hospitals, particularly in the proximity of the caller patient’s location. The capacity created to deal with calls made on the helpline numbers; the nature of assistance rendered, and; the log maintained for the same, if any, should also be placed before the court,” the bench said in an order uploaded to the website on Wednesday.The Delhi government’s standing counsel (criminal), advocate Rahul Mehra provided 10 helpline numbers, which include the numbers the caller had dialled, besides an interactive call number — 1031. He said the helpline numbers were found not to be functioning efficiently and instructions had been issued to set the system in order. He said it would be done in the next couple of days.Appearing for the Centre, standing counsel Kirtiman Singh told the court that number 1075 is an all-India helpline number and about 3 lakh calls have been received on it so far. Responding to the court’s observations, a Delhi government official said, “We will launch an app later this week. It is expected to further streamline the process”.The order comes after the court took note of a video by one Deepak Bhardwaj, who had said the deputy medical superintendent of Max Hospital, Patparganj, asked him to arrange a ventilator and bed in another hospital. Bhardwaj’s mother, Shyama Sharma, was admitted to Max Hospital, Patparganj, on May 19 and tested positive for Covid-19 on May 21.“The patient continues to be under treatment at Max Hospital, Patparganj, and the family is convinced with her course or treatment at the hospital. Since the matter is sub-judice, we would not like to comment any further,” said Max Healthcare in a statement.In the video clipping, he said he visited several hospitals but to no avail. He alleged he called the Centre’s helpline number — 1075 — multiple times and two of Delhi government’s helplines, but got no response. He said the district surveillance officer also did not respond to calls.“The patient continues to be under treatment at Max Hospital, Patparganj, and the family is convinced with her course or treatment at the hospital. Since the matter is sub-judice, we would not like to comment any further,” said Max Healthcare in an official statement.The court said the issues raised in the recording were of public concern in the present-day context. It said a person who, or whose family or friend is found Covid-19 positive, should be able to call the helplines to not only report such an occurrence but to also seek guidance and assistance about hospitals where such patients may be taken.“The helplines should render meaningful and effective help to the callers. If the experience of Dharmendra Bhardwaj is anything to go by, it appears, this aspect has not been adequately addressed by the respondents,” the court said. The court said the Delhi government should consider providing ambulance facilities to pick up serious Covid-19 patients for hospitalisation.The bench scheduled the next hearing for June 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/court-seeks-details-of-steps-for-hospitalisation-of-serious-covid-19-cases/story-fMNzrfuWe9BxhDlidhi7BI.html
27-05-2020||City||Gurugram’s Covid-19 cases with links to Delhi clustered in crowded areas of the city, says report||Gurugram: As a part of the contact tracing of coronavirus (Covid-19) disease patients to curb its spread, the district health department has found that at least 100 patients had links to Delhi, adding that most of these 100 are clustered in Dundahera, Khandsa and Jyoti Park.A report prepared by the health department on May 23, when the coronavirus tally in the city was 262, shows that a single patient who was infected with the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease, in Delhi, transmitted the contagious virus to about five to 15 people in Gurugram.“After the ease in lockdown rules, the spill-over of infections from Delhi is likely to increase. We are collating data to review the situation. The purpose of the report is to study the contact tracing of cases so far and to find Covid-19 clusters where transmission could be prevented,” said Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer (CMO).In the last week of April, the Haryana government had closed the Delhi-Gurugram border to prevent movement of people to and from Delhi to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease. The borders are not yet unsealed and only those with valid movement passes are allowed. In peak hours, to avoid traffic congestion, employees and workers coming from Delhi are, however, allowed to cross the border without any pass. The report, accessed by HT, shows that the first patient having links with Delhi was detected in March, after the wife of a Covid-19 patient in Nirvana Country had tested positive. The husband was admitted to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi. Then, at least 17 people in Gurugram, who attended a Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Nizamuddin Delhi mid-March, had tested positive for Covid-19.A case was reported from Dundahera when a man had contracted the virus at Ram Manohar Lohia hospital in Delhi after he had to take his epileptic son there for treatment. The man returned to Gurugram on April 22 for a day while his son was undergoing treatment in Delhi. He got himself tested in Delhi before he came to Gurugram and returned to Delhi the next day. On April 25, he was confirmed for Covid-19 and was admitted to AIIMS, Jhajjar. Doctors in Delhi had then informed the Gurugram health team about the case. “When the team collected samples, three of them had tested Covid-19 positive,” said Punia.“Later, five people living in the same building where the man had visited were found coronavirus-positive. One among the five transmitted the virus to four other people. They further infected over five people,” he said. As per the report, one of them is a tailor in an export company. “It was found that more than 40 were living in the same building and one positive case transmitted the virus to at least 15 people,” said Punia, adding that all were put under institutional quarantine to prevent the virus’ spread. Notably, Dundahera shares a border with Delhi.Likewise, in Jyoti Park, a young man, who worked for a referral ambulance service in Delhi, also tested positive. Before his reports confirming the same, though, the man had already transmitted the infection to at least eight people, including three health staff members of a private hospital where he had gone for a health checkup.On May 4, at least nine cases were traced to Gurugram’s Khandsa mandi, the vegetable market. Of these, seven had links with Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi while two dealers had contacts with people in Nasik and West Bengal. But as the district health department increased surveillance, they found that at least 20 people had already contracted the coronavirus from Azadpur mandi.Other affected cases with links to Delhi are based in Sirhol, Palam Vihar, Sector 10A, Jawahar Nagar and Sector 53, the report adds.Gurugram deputy commissioner Amit Khatri did not offer a comment over the issue||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-s-covid-19-cases-with-links-to-delhi-clustered-in-crowded-areas-of-the-city-says-report/story-r0gsdC45crIR1HiKKX9aUM.html

Civil surgeon Manjit Singh said: “Whenever police bring an accused for medical checkup, we conduct the Covid test. While the report is awaited, the accused is kept in police custody.”However, police are facing issues in getting the reports, which take about one day and till then the accused has to be kept in the police custody as a safety measure. “We take special permission from the courts to keep accused in the custody while the reports are awaited,” said a police official posted in Zirakpur. Ever since the outbreak took place, those arrested in Mohali are being sent to the Ludhiana jail.“Covid-19 free health certificates have been made mandatory for new prisoners. The jail authorities do not accept any prisoner without the corona test,” said a sub-inspector posted at the Kharar subdivision of Mohali.The jail authorities have set up a screening centre as well and before admitting any accused, they get all the tests done as per the updated list of health check up of prisoners. An assistant sub-inspector posted at the Dera Bassi subdivision of Mohali, requesting anonymity, said,“It is for our safety also. With most of the positive cases being asymptomatic, we do not know who could be positive, thus getting the test done is in a way keeping us safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/all-arrested-in-mohali-being-tested-for-covid/story-4pDn5z2Hr5WTYfD2lkzgVM.html

The baby had breathing issues and thus was put on the ventilator; however, when his father said that he could not afford the treatment, the private hospital did not provide a proper referral slip or an ambulance with a functional ventilator. The four-hour-old baby could only breathe with help, but the hospital took it off life support and asked the father to go elsewhere,” CMO Dr Deepak Ohri said.He said that after the police called 108 and asked for an ambulance, due to a lack of referral and medical staff, the ambulance driver did not know where to go and took the baby to the Dadri Community Health Centre (CHC).“Dadri CHC did not have the expertise to treat the newborn, so they referred him to the Government Hospital, Noida, which referred him to Child PGI at Sector 30. However, the baby died before reaching the hospital,” Ohri said.He said that the two officials are already investigating the case and will take action against the hospital. When asked about the ambulance delay, issues with the oxygen cylinder and the poor role of the government hospitals as alleged by the father, Ohri said that they are yet to be ascertained.“The ambulance had the proper facility for administering oxygen, but the probe is on,” the CMO said.On Tuesday, Prem Kumar, a resident of Sector 36, Noida, was made to go from one government hospital to another to get his newborn treated.The distraught father said he had to wait for two hours for an ambulance to arrive and was made to go to three government hospitals with the unwell baby. The newborn was finally declared dead on arrival at the third hospital, the Child PGI, on Tuesday morning. The father later made a video narrating his ordeal while returning home with the body of his baby tied to his motorcycle.“After multiple calls, the ambulance arrived about two hours later. We took the baby off life support only to find that the ambulance did not have a functional oxygen cylinder onboard,” Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/irresponsible-behaviour-of-a-private-hospital-behind-newborn-s-death-in-noida-probe-on-health-officials/story-AG5bjqEODAUydsWDBkPAuM.html

He said he had disowned his son about six years back, while his daughter-in-law was staying on the first floor and he and his wife on the ground floor.Rajinder said he had lodged a police complaint against his daughter for harassing them a month ago, adding that the SHO came to his house on Tuesday night and took away the keys to the room on the second floor and even abused and threatened him and his wife with implication in a false case. However, denying the allegations, the SHO said, “It was a domestic dispute and I had taken the key of the room into custody so that the family members sort out their differences.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohali-ssp-marks-probe-over-misbehaviour-plaint-against-sohana-sho/story-8G48CXcfQrDyTKpy6CkrKL.html
27-05-2020||Delhi||Covid count crosses 15,000 mark in national capital Delhi||On Wednesday, a day after the number of new Covid-19 cases in Delhi fell below 500 (412) for the first time in a week, the national capital reported 792 infections of the disease, the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin said. The fresh cases took Delhi’s infection tally to 15,257 since the first Covid-19 case was reported on March 2.The bulletin said 15 more deaths have taken the toll from Covid-19 in the city to 303. The Covid-19 mortality rate in the city is now almost 2%, compared to 2.8% nationally. Delhi’s mortality rate has been going up since a three-member death audit committee started adding more deaths caused by the pandemic to the cumulative report from May 12. With 86 deaths and 7,639 cases, the mortality rate was 1.1% in Delhi on May 12.According to the daily data released by the Delhi government, more people are being tested and the percentage of people testing positive went up to 13.7% on Wednesday from 7.6% on May 18 when Delhi recorded 299 cases, one of the lowest in a day this month. This brings Delhi closer to the scenario for which a five-member advisory committee, to advise the CM on Covid-19, asked the government to be prepared for-- 1,000 cases daily. The first scenario was 100 and the second 500 cases daily.Experts warned the number of cases is likely to go up further. “The lockdown [to check the pandemic spread] was like a lid. People were staying indoors and not coming in contact with a lot of people, reducing the chances of infections. Once you lift the lid, more people are bound to get infected,” said Dr Lalit Kant, the former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the Indian Council of Medical Research.Kant said that is the normal course of the infection. “The chances of the virus dying down on its own is minimal; it has not happened in any of the countries. The lockdown gave us time to prepare our systems. What we need to do is keep our vulnerable safe--the old, people with a compromised immune system, the poor bearing the brunt of the lockdown and who do not have good nutrition--to reduce mortality.”The Delhi government eased the lockdown last week and allowed public transport, reopening of the markets based on the odd-even formula and liquor shops, except those inside malls.The Delhi government has maintained since March that it is prepared to handle 1,000 cases daily. Given that 30% of all active cases in Delhi are currently hospitalised, 1,000 daily cases would at least lead to around 300 hospital admissions a day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-count-crosses-15-000-mark-in-national-capital-delhi/story-zu5HXsoID0VwgrciqjfEsN.html

The victim, identified as Sukhpal Singh, is a resident of Garhi Chaukhandi village under Phase 3 police jurisdiction. According to the police, the incident took place around 5.15am.“An unknown person shot at the victim and fled the scene. We got to know about the incident when a jogger called the police helpline. Singh’s family members and passersby took him to a private hospital in Sector 71. He received an injury to his shoulder and is recuperating now,” said Ankur Aggarwal, additional deputy commissioner of police, Zone 2.Based on the complaint of the victim’s younger brother, Vijay Pal, a case of attempt to murder (Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code) has been registered at the Phase 3 police station, the police said.Police officials said that this was not a robbery attempt as the suspect did not try to take Singh’s valuables. Prima facie it seems that Singh was attacked by someone who was familiar with his routine, said the police.“The family has not mentioned any personal enmity. However, we are exploring all possible angles and nothing has been ruled out yet,” said Harish Chandra, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 2.The officials said that for now there are no clues about the shooter. The CCTV footage from the nearby areas will be scanned to trace the suspect, they said. The victim is a property owner which he had leased to multiple tenants and property disputes could also be behind the attack, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-shot-at-during-morning-walk-in-sector-68/story-9ZSeZa4MRE1cHoESMWLzFI.html
27-05-2020||Delhi||DMRC suspends breath analyser test for drivers due to Covid-19||To contain the spread of Covid-19, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Wednesday ordered that train operators will not have to take the breath analyser test when it resumes services.“As a precautionary measure to control the spread of Covid-19, breath analyser tests have been temporarily suspended. However, all train operators will be required to submit a declaration before they sign in for duty, till this practice stays in place,” Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC, said.According to the order, train operators will have to declare that they have not used any “alcoholic drink, sedative, narcotic or stimulant drug or preparation within eight hours before commencement of their duty or during it”.A breath analyser test, a DMRC official said, is crucial for the safety of train operations. It is mandatory, as per Section 29(5) of the Metro Rail General Rules, for train operators to undergo the test before starting their duty.The official said supervisors will conduct surprise checks to ensure operators do not flout the rules.Recently, three DMRC staff had tested positive for Covid-19 --- the contagious disease that has affected more than 15,000 people in Delhi and killed over 300. This is one of the many precautionary measures the Metro is taking to protect its staff and commuters, once operations restart, from Covid-19, the official said. Delhi Metro services were suspended on March 22, even before the first phase of the nationwide lockdown was implemented from March 25.In mid-March, DMRC employees had written to Mangu Singh, the managing director of DMRC, requesting the immediate discontinuation of the breath analyser test for train operators because of the Covid-19 outbreak. But no decision could be taken as Metro operations were halted.More than 1,500 train operators work with DMRC.Among other measures planned by DMRC to contain the spread of Covid-19 is thermal screening of commuters.Dayal said, “We have procured around 800 thermal guns/screening machines; they will be in place in time for the commencement of services. The screening process may involve both DMRC and CISF personnel, depending on the size of the station and the flow of passengers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dmrc-suspends-breath-analyser-test-for-drivers-due-to-covid-19/story-3UvnIjpq9OCWviVxX1yJaO.html

It said that out of the 20, six patients admitted in the Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute were shifted to the Jhajjar campus after a call from the DSU. The court was hearing a plea by a lawyer Karan Seth through his advocate Arjun Sayal, who sought better facilities for outstation patients who have been residing in the night shelter outside the hospital. Another petitioner, Rachna Malik, through her advocate Vaibhav Pratap Singh, had conducted an inspection on the last date after the court issued immediate action.The court, on the last date, had sought to know from the authorities as to why the patients had been sent to far off hospitals such as LNJP and Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute when they were being treated here. AIIMS said the hospital had been treating Covid-19 patients and has a total 1,500 patients till now.According to advocate Sayal, the Delhi government counsel said the patients could not be shifted to AIIMS Delhi because it is inaccessible. A detailed court order on the hearing is yet to be uploaded on the official website.Meanwhile, the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), told the court that due to the summer season, there was an issue of less pressure in the water pipeline and hence water jars of 20 litres capacity was supplied to meet drinking water needs.The board said the existing booster pump had now been replaced with a new one to increase the water pressure. Two water coolers of 150 litres capacity with water purifier systems had been installed at the night shelter.The court was informed toilets and bathrooms are cleaned and sanitised regularly by the shelter management agency’s sanitation staff. The infrastructure maintenance work has been carried out by the civil and electrical engineering divisions of DUSIB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-positive-shelter-home-patients-never-brought-to-us-aiims/story-djrgVNC9aInqHPNONXfRZJ.html

The move is aimed at discouraging the people to visit the office in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, authority officials said.As per the officials, at least 1,000 visitors, including residents, plot allottees, developers and industrial plot owners, come to the authority office on a normal day. “If it is extremely important to meet any official, then the visitor will have to seek an appointment with the official concerned, and after the time is fixed he or she can come to discuss the grievance. Without appointment, the entry of visitors will not be allowed,” said Deep Chand, additional chief executive officer of Greater Noida authority.The authority has also directed its staff to sit at a distance of two metres and follow all standard operating procedures (SOPs) laid down by the government at the workplace. “We have decided to start making electronic files to approve any proposal related with civic issues, development work, land acquisition or individual grievance. If any residents or plot allottees want to get a work done or grievance to be addressed, then they can drop their complaint in a box installed at the gate,” said Chand.The authority has decided to sanitise the drop box at regular intervals and the staff will collect the proposals or complaints from the drop box after a certain time. The resident or property allottee will use drop box facility only if he cannot get work done via online services available at the portal of the authority, said the officials.Besides, it will make a separate entry and exit gates at the authority building so that staff also can keep certain distance from each other.Greater Noida is spread on 38,000 hectares of land and the authority has allotted land for group housing, schools, factories, industries, among others. “We have decided to set up a meeting hall at the ground floor with three chairs placed at a distance of at least 2 metres, so that the visitors can meet the official concerned,” said Chand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/now-take-appointment-to-meet-officials-at-g-noida-authority-office/story-QjkSWEhzNef10P2hF1jGCN.html
27-05-2020||Noida||Irked by low sales, GB Nagar traders demand change in curfew timings||The 7am to 7pm timing for shops and marketplaces is not working for the shop owners in Gautam Budh Nagar, who now get to open their individual shops only on alternate days. The representatives of different markets said their timings collides with the office timings and as Sunday has been mandated as sanitization day, the markets are yet to see sales picking up.Sushil Kumar Jain, president, Sector 18 market association, said taking cognisance of traders’ problems, the government must change the 12-hour curfew from 7pm to 7am. “Most of our customers are either at work or running their own businesses. They do not get the time to shop after returning offices. And, on Sunday, a holiday when many could hit the markets, the shops are mandatorily closed for disinfection and sanitization,” he said.Jain said traders do not have a problem with the 12-hour curfew. “We just want the curfew timings to change slightly. Even if it is rescheduled, say, from 10pm to 10am, we will be happy as most customers will then have time to visit our shops even after returning home from work,” he said.Echoing similar views, CB Jha, president of Atta market association, said in the present scenario, traders will not be able to sustain themselves for a long time. “Expenses have gone up due to the pandemic and the returns are negligible. The highest daily sale recorded at our market today (Wednesday) and was to the tune of ₹1,000. Even if it increases at a rate of 20%, the monthly income of a shopkeeper, who gets to open shop only every alternate day would be around ₹20,000. How can we meet the rent, staff salaries and other expenses with this earning? We are waiting for the Prime Minister’s speech Sunday. If he does not come up with some major relaxations, we have unanimously decided to down our shutters permanently,” he said.Zakir Hussain, who runs a jewellery shop in Sector 22, said despite giving regular GST returns, the small and medium businessmen are the biggest sufferers. “If the government can provide monetary assistance to farmers and MSME entrepreneurs, the small and middle level businessmen should also be the part of the beneficiaries’ bracket,” he said.Anita Singh, who runs a stationary shop in Sector 18, said shopkeepers of different markets in Noida are keeping their fingers crossed. “We are waiting for the fourth phase of the lockdown to end on May 31. After that, we will take a call on how to proceed. The government has nothing for us in its recently announced ₹2 lakh crore package. We have no subsidy on electricity bills. The interest on our bank loans is mounting up every day,” she said.When contacted, district magistrate Suhas LY said his administration is working on all possible relief measures for businessmen. “We will also consider the issue of changing the curfew timing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/irked-by-low-sales-gb-nagar-traders-demand-change-in-curfew-timings/story-EuEZGBfs42ejGV7ysfLhzH.html
27-05-2020||Chandigarh||Monsoon a month away, only 10% road gullies cleaned in Chandigarh||Even as monsoon is stated to arrive on time from June 30, the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) has managed to clean only 10% of the 30,000 road gullies in the city so far.Confirming the same, MC executive officer Vijay Premi, who is in-charge of storm water drainage, said, “From June 1, we will work at a much faster speed since double the present 73 workers will be on the job,” he said, adding that they hope to complete the task before June 30.MC chief engineer Shailender Singh said. “The work had only started after the fourth phase of the lockdown. But we will definitely clean all road gullies before monsoon starts here.”FALLING SHORTMeanwhile, city residents are not happy with the ongoing road gully cleaning work. Claiming that MC workers weren’t cleaning the gullies from the inside, president of the Sector 8 residents’ welfare association (RWA) Ranvinder Singh Gill said, “The road gullies are cleaned only from the top without opening them. I had asked the workers to open up the gullies near my house but they refused.”Noting that the problem had only gotten this bad in recent years, chairman of the Sector 35 RWA, JS Gogia said, “Ever since we have started paying more taxes, the situation is getting worse. The V6 roads in Sector 35D are the worst hit, and road gullies remain blocked as well.”President of the Sector 44B RWA, Swadesh Talwar, added that road gullies were already blocked and leading to flooding even during the rain in May. “The situation will only get worse during the monsoon showers in June. I request MC to speed it up and clean the gullies properly from inside which generally is not done,” he said.Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC) chairman and president of the Sector 21 RWA, Baljinder Singh Bittu, said, “Maintenance of road gullies is an annual exercise and the Covid epidemic can be no excuse for delaying it. Every year, the authorities swing into action only after the first spell of rains and pre-monsoon takes place.”MC chief engineer Shailender Singh, however, denied these claims, “Even malba being taken out of the road gullies is being immediately lifted. If anyone thinks that cleaning was not done properly in their area, we will get it cleaned again.”Meanwhile, members of Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) also received many complaints regarding the issue and chairman Hitesh Puri said they will apprise the MC authorities about them. MC ASKS UT TO CLEAN CHOESThe MC has taken up matter with the UT engineering department seeking cleaning of city’s seasonal drainage rivulets — N-choe, Sukhna choe and Patiala Ki Rao.An official said it was imperative to de-silt and de-weed the rivulets, especially N-choe and Sukhna choe, since all road gullies discharge rain water into these choes. “If the choes are not cleaned properly, their water-carrying capacity gets affected significantly during the monsoon, leading to waterlogging in the areas.”Earlier during the monsoon two years ago, the floodgates of Sukhna Lake had to be opened as the water level had increased beyond the permissible limit due to incessant rain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/monsoon-a-month-away-only-10-road-gullies-cleaned-in-chandigarh/story-yhUCEYPYON2nXYwtuLqsnM.html
27-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Sealing parameters for highrise societies relaxed; random sampling directed in trans-Hindon areas||Ghaziabad: In what may come as a breather for residents of residential highrises in Ghaziabad, the district health department officials on Wednesday said they have decided to redefine the parameters of sealing towers in residential societies, incase residents living there contract the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. According to the chief medical officer (CMO) on Wednesday issued an order and relaxed the sealing of Jaipuria Sunrise Greens highrise in Indirapuram which was fully sealed on May 24.“I have issued an order to relax the full sealing of the highrise. As per the order, only one tower of the society, from where a 35-year-old resident was found positive, will be sealed. This will now be made applicable for all highrise societies in urban areas. Henceforth, if there is a single case in a society, only that particular tower (where the infected case lives) will be sealed,” CMO Dr NK Gupta said.He added, though, that the sealing parameters will depend on the number of cases in a highrise. “In case there is more than one case in a highrise and a cluster-like situation emerges, we will increase the area a bit to 400 metres and try that other residents are least affected. If there are more towers in the complex of the same society beyond this limit, they will not be sealed,” he added.In the directions, issued Wednesday evening, the CMO directed for sealing of only the L tower of the Jaipuria Sunrise Greens society, which has a total of 16 towers comprising as many as 1,103 flats.The Noida authorities on Tuesday had issued similar relaxation guidelines for sealing of towers in residential societies in the city.In another direction to check community spread of Covid-19, if any, the Ghaziabad CMO has directed for initiation of random sampling in areas of Indirapuram, Vaishali and Kaushambi.According to official records, the localities of Khoda (30 cases) and Loni (21 cases) have emerged as hotbeds for Covid-19 cases. The official statistics state that besides these two, localities of Vaishali and Indirapuram have witnessed about 19 and 15 Covid-19 cases so far, respectively.“We have been carrying on random sampling in Khoda and also from containment zones. Such sampling measures have now been directed in areas of Indirapuram, Vaishali and Kaushambi, etc. as cases continue to surface. Random sampling will help us deploy teams which will pick up random samples of residents. This method will help us check if there is any community spread,” Dr Gupta said.He further said that he has also given directions for speedy discharge of persons from quarantine facilities and is now stressing more on home quarantine.“Since the government order has also come for home quarantine of close contacts of Covid-19 patients, we have directed officials that such persons should be placed in home quarantine if they have separate rooms and toilets at their homes. Even those close contacts who have tested negative for the disease at least once or who have completed 14 days in quarantine facilities be sent home immediately,” the CMO added.SECTOR SCHEME TO BE DEPLOYED IN LONIIn another major directive for Ghaziabad, the district magistrate on Wednesday said that the Loni town will be subjected to the sector scheme with deployment of magistrates in different sectors and the movement of Loni residents will be restricted to areas of Delhi and Noida.“The sector scheme in Loni will be applicable from May 28 and will be on lines of Khoda, where for instance an entire locality was divided into sectors and managed by magistrates. Under the scheme, teams of health department will take up extensive surveys, sanitisation, surveillance, sampling and other activities in order to check for presence of Covid-19 affected persons,” Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said.“This is being done as there are a number of Covid-19 cases which have emerged from Loni and we need to enhance surveillance to check any further spread,” he added.According to the directions issued with respect to Loni, officials have been asked to make announcements that Loni residents should make arrangements for their stay in Delhi and Noida if they go to these cities for work.For the purpose of initiation of the sector scheme, Loni has been divided in four zones and eight sectors wherein every sector will have deployment of magistrates, police officers and teams of the health department.The administration on May 10 had sealed Khoda till further orders in order to prevent the spread of Covid-19 infection, after a number of cases were reported from there.“In Khoda, 30 persons were found positive while 1,183 persons were found negative. Out of 30, 26 have been discharged while only a single death case resulted, which was due to comorbid conditions of the patient,” the CMO added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-sealing-parameters-for-highrise-societies-relaxed-random-sampling-directed-in-trans-hindon-areas/story-qf7nl4ZJlEypadrKOkujDJ.html

Constructed in 1905 over 59.55 km, it was a game-changing project that laid the foundation of rapid transformation of rural agricultural economy in Jammu. The famous Basmati rice of R S Pura owes its cultivation primarily to this canal.“The canal enters into the vicinity of the international boundary close to Pakistan. For the past many years, a large amount of silt had accumulated here which resulted in huge blockage in the canal system as the flow of water was also restricted. Farmers in the region were also constantly approaching the UT administration for desilting of the canal,” said a BSF spokesperson.The irrigation and flood control department of J&K approached the BSF authorities for assistance in desilting work close to the border.“Despite huge apprehension of firing by Pakistan to thwart the work, BSF’s timely help to the UT administration was made in the best interest of farmers. The work was taken up in the Arnia and RS Pura sectors under the supervision of senior officers with foolproof security to the civil staff working beyond the barbed fence. The work was completed in record time,” the spokesperson said.The spokesperson added, “Pak Rangers objected to the work and also adopted aggressive posture, but the deft and tactical handling of situation led to successful completion of the work. The locals are very happy as it will immensely benefit farmers in Jammu district.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bsf-facilitates-ranbir-canal-desilting-on-border-despite-pak-objections/story-qZeSdyDQpI0JMphwnWDSwM.html

27-05-2020||City||Most migrants gone, Delhi govt working on exit plan from shelter relief scheme||New Delhi: With over two lakh stranded migrant workers leaving the capital for their home states over the past few weeks, the Delhi government has started working on an exit plan for the temporary shelter programme it has been running. To start with, it has reduced the number of meals being offered at the shelters from three to two. Breakfast is not given anymore. The move comes after the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) told the government that most of the temporary shelters set up in schools to house migrant workers had been closed since they had left for their home states. Also, the huge crowds and long queues at the over 1,600 government-run hunger relief centres had reduced by almost half, Delhi government officials said. DUSIB member Bipin Rai said breakfast was suspended temporarily because a review was being done. “We have recommended the government to restart distribution of breakfast from June 1. A decision will be taken around May 29-30 for how long the provision of all meals at the shelters as well as hunger centres will go on,” he said. The NGOs running the permanent shelters for the government had earlier this month raised concerns over breakfast distribution being stopped from May 14. During the lockdown, while NGOs were responsible for providing two meals, lunch and dinner, at these shelters, the government had roped in some private organisations for providing breakfast. Prior to the lockdown, there was no provision of free meals at the shelters. The homeless residents of Delhi at these shelters depend on Good Samaritans who provide food. Data with the Delhi government shows that with most of the migrants gone, the daily beneficiaries at its 1,669 hunger relief centres had declined by over four lakh. “Earlier we used to get a minimum 9 lakh people each during lunch and dinner. This has reduced. On Tuesday, the HRCs fed 701,073 people during lunch and served dinner to 694,241 people. The numbers have reduced because over 2 lakh migrants have been sent back home in Shramik trains form Delhi,” said a media advisor to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.The official said a lot of temporary shelters set up in schools had now been closed with the migrants gone. Another official, not wishing to be named, said at least a dozen such shelters had been cleared, though the final number could be higher. “The data is still being compiled and the complete list of shelters that are now empty is unavailable as of now,” the official said. Over 2 71,000 stranded migrants had left Delhi in 214 Shramik Special trains between May 7 and May 26, deputy CM Manish Sisodia had said in a statement on Tuesday. These trains are run in a special arrangement between the state governments, as per Central government guidelines.The Delhi government had converted 256 school buildings into temporary shelters to house the stranded migrants soon after the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24. Besides this, DUSIB has around 243 permanent shelters where over 5,000 people are housed. These are people who live permanently at shelters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/most-migrants-gone-delhi-govt-working-on-exit-plan-from-shelter-relief-scheme/story-HgZlDcDnCuNNQp1kY8WaNN.html
27-05-2020||City||Restriction on working of domestic helps in Ghaziabad township||Ghaziabad:Days after the district magistrate directed that domestic helps and other self-employed persons like electricians and plumbers will not be restricted to enter the residential high-rises, some resident bodies have resorted to roll out their own set of instructions.In his written order issued on May 23, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey had issued directions that arrangement of provision of services can be planned between the employer and the service provider and the local RWA will only have role of an advisor or convener.In the latest instance, the Crossings Republik Owners & Members Association (CROMA), an umbrella RWA body of Crossings Republik Township, has issued a set of ‘advisory’ to be followed against Covid-19 pandemic.“A domestic help will not work in more than three houses and the houses will be of the same tower. She will not be allowed to go to a different tower. Domestic helps will have to go out by 11am after finishing work, and thereafter the society will be sanitised,” said one of the directions issued by CROMA regarding the domestic helps.The Crossings Republik Township has presence of about 15,000 families living in about 28 residential high-rise projects.The directions issued by CROMA have also barred entry of delivery boys inside the society and the residents will have to pick up items from the main gate. Likewise, the delivery of milk has to be done by 11am at flats after which the lifts will be sanitised, they added.Tarun Bharat Chauhan, president of CROMA, said that the instructions have been issued in form of advisory.“There are number of high-rises and people were confused whether to call domestic helps or not. So, residents asked us to frame rules. The problem multi-storeyed buildings face is that when one person enters a high-rise, he uses different common facilities. If one person is infected, other residents will face issues in form of sealing, etc. Our rules are in form of advisory and individual apartment owners’ associations of different high-rises can make changes and implement,” Chauhan said.“At present, we have allowed domestic helps to work in only three flats. We have an in-house app through which domestic helps can be reshuffled to other flats,” he added.The district magistrate’s order on May 23 had specifically restricted the role of RWAs in terms of allowing domestic helps in any society. “The district administration has issued specific orders about the entry of domestic helps, vendors, etc, and it is arrangement between the service provider and the employer. If there are issues, residents can send complaints to the district magistrate or the additional district magistrate (city). We will take action,” Pandey said.Meanwhile, office bearers of other RWA bodies offered different views.Alok Kumar, founder member of Federation of Association of Apartment Owners, said that RWAs should not consider themselves as “administrative officers”.“The DM has already issued directions. The RWAs are caretaker of apartments. If there is anything wrong, RWAs can always approach authorities. If any service provider is posing any issues, complaints can be sent to district officials. The directions by DM should not be altered,” Kumar added.VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi apartments RWA (KARWA), said that district magistrate’s order has to be implemented in totality and RWAs cannot partially or fully modify the order.“We have circulated DM’s order to all our member RWAs and have asked them that they should advise the residents to work according to the order. It is a magisterial order and cannot be modified,” he added.However, Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of Flat Owners’ Federation, said that RWAs are responsible for respective high-rises. “We support the order given by CROMA because the instructions issued by the district magistrate are not in the interest of public. The order by DM is basically confusing and to demean the RWAs. If any RWA has issued some impractical instructions, then course correction can be done,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/restriction-on-working-of-domestic-helps-in-ghaziabad-township/story-Wzab970AZHsXC23JtJAQEI.html

People with questionable antecedents and dubious credentials, if given the command, could invite disaster in the UT and nullify the gains achieved in the past.”“Questioning the government’s moves, howsoever ridiculous or unconstitutional they may be, is treated with contempt and considered offensive by the present dispensation. It could entail imprisonment, house arrests or even invocation of PSA against those daring to exercise their democratic rights of questioning the government. And, those having the temerity to question further become ipso facto anti-nationals.Singh maintained that Panthers Party would oppose all undemocratic and authoritarian decisions of the government to uphold the noble values enshrined in our Constitution.He asked why a government should be formed at all by providing constitutional powers to those who are known for defying the people’s mandate by defecting to other political parties time and again. “Can such opportunist leaders do any good to the system or the people of J&K,” he inquired.The former education minister called for early restoration of democracy and revival of duly elected government in the UT in accordance with the procedure encapsulated in the Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/backdoor-induction-of-govt-in-can-be-disastrous-says-j-k-politico/story-k3BshOZPZCNffSHa8pWANN.html

However, both the parties have now decided to bury the animosity and verbal war on the social media.On Wednesday morning, cops led by senior officers went to hospitals and offered flowers and sweets to the doctors and paramedical staff.“May 27 should be declared as Covid Warriors’ Valentine’s Day with a pledge that all the warrior valentines express true love and respect each other or else it might sound like April Phool’s day … Let there be clear cut directions for smooth, respectful, hassle and heckling-free movement of all Covid warriors,” said doctor Ijatiba Shafi.“After beating some doctors and stopping them from doing their duty, police is now presenting flowers to the health staff outside SMHS hospital,” said Athar Parvaz, an environmentalist.After a senior cardiologist on his way to the hospital was beaten up by the police and detained for several hours on May 23, and Bandipore chief medical officer was stopped at a checkpoint, Kashmir inspector general of police Vijay Kumar had on Tuesday issued instructions to his officers to be respectful to the people, especially doctors who on Covid-19 duty.“We can understand that the frontline workers are facing many problems at different levels, but judging others’ mode of duty and their shortcomings is not appropriate,” Baramulla SSP Abdul Qayoom told his officers in a message. “We all must adhere to our basic parameters within the legal and conventional framework of coexistence in the system,” he added.He also told his officers that though they have a tough job, other departments expect a cop to behave in a way that is suitable to them, which sometimes enrages officers on the ground. “I appeal to my officers on the ground to maintain cool, have patience and perform in the larger interests of the society of which they are also a part,” he said.On Tuesday and Wednesday, doctors and paramedical staff had held protests at various places demanding action against the erring cops. The police had already promised inquiry into the detention of senior cardiologist Syed Maqbool. Following these incidents, senior police officers directed cops to be respectful to the people especially medical staff who are performing duties in extreme conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-use-charm-offensive-a-day-after-they-are-flayed-for-high-handedness-while-dealing-with-docs/story-csTQgBg0efeQBLXnmW5hDI.html

The request for the court building was meant for setting up a temporary isolation ward for Kolhapur city as the adjoining hospital did not have sufficient space to accommodate the increasing number of Covid-19 patients.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice KK Tated while hearing the PIL filed by Dilip Desai, a social worker and philanthropist from Kolhapur, on Tuesday through video conferencing was informed by senior advocate Satish Talekar that there was only one government hospital in Kolhapur, the Chhatrapati Pramila Raje (CPR) district hospital, which was providing treatment to both Covid and non-Covid patients from the same premise. This, Talekar said, was creating an unsafe environment for non-Covid patients, especially expecting mothers who got admitted to the hospital. Talekar submitted that there was an urgent need to set up a separate isolation unit for Covid positive patients.Desai’s petition further said that as per information received under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, the district magistrate and chairperson of the district disaster management authority on April 28 had written to the principal judge sessions court seeking temporary handover of four buildings of the old district and sessions court situated across the road from the hospital to enable setting up of separate spaces for Covid-19 and regular patients. Talekar said as the district and sessions court had been shifted to a new premise, barring the ground floor of one of the four buildings in the old court complex, the remaining buildings were vacant and hence the district magistrate and disaster management authority had requested for the buildings to set up an isolation ward away from the main CPR hospital building.Talekar stated that as per a communication from the Building Committee of the HC on May 8, the request was rejected without assigning any reason. In light of this and the fact that there could be a spurt in the number of Covid positive cases in Kolhapur, the plea prayed for directions to the disaster management authority to requisition the old district and sessions court building for segregation of patients and to submit a report on measures taken to segregate Covid and non-Covid patients visiting the CPR hospital and other reliefs.After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that as the HC’s building committee and principal judge of the district and sessions court were necessary parties they should be impleaded in the petition and posted the matter for hearing on May 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-directs-petitioner-to-implead-registrar-general-of-hc-principal-judge-of-district-court-in-plea-seeking-court-premise-for-isolation-ward/story-Gx7Svum1ciW0KZc31MtY0I.html

27-05-2020||City||Hit hard by lockdown, Ludhiana’s IELTS, visa consultants seek relief from rent||Impacted by the Covid-19 lockdown, owners of International English Language Testing System (IELTS) coaching centres and visa consultancy firms here have urged the government to provide relief to them by directing their to charge only 50% of the total rent for this year. There are around 750 IELTS and visa consultancy firms in the district, most of them located in Model Town Extension, Feroze Gandhi Market, near the ISBT, Sector 32, Khanna, Doraha, Samrala and Macchiwara.Recently, these centres and firms, attached to the Study Abroad Association, gave a memorandum to deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal in this regard and the DC recommended the memorandum to the chief minister’s office. The coaching centres, that prepare around 35,000 to 40,000 candidates to go abroad every year, are located in the prime locations of the city with a monthly rent of Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh. With no income, the firms are only buying time from landlords to pay rent. President of the association Mitesh Malhotra, who runs seven IELTS and visa consultancy centres in Ludhiana, said the period between April and September was peak season, when a majority of aspirants joind universities or colleges abroad, while in January, there are primarily those applicants, who could not clear IELTS in the first round or didn’t get admission for other reasons. “Even if we start IELTS classes by June or July-end with 30% of the total capacity, only 1/4 of the students of the total average of 40,000 annually will be able to go abroad in the January intake and the commission, that we will get from the universities for January intake, will arrive by April next year,” he said.Criticising the government for not supporting coaching and consultancy establishments at this time, Malhotra said while the government holds NRI sammelans (congregations) to appreciate the contribution made by NRIs for the development of the state, they have no regard for the establishments, that help in making these people NRIs. “We coach and help so many people to go abroad for studies. Coaching and consultancy centres have always played a big role in providing quality life to many Punjabis, who have settled abroad, but the government never thinks of announcing any relief for us,” he said. Gagneet Singh Grewal, who runs a visa-cum-consultancy centre in the Ferozepur Gandhi Market, said, “If the government fails to curb the spread of coronavirus, some countries might not allow the migration of Indians due to which many students, who had earlier planned to study abroad, might decide to pursue their graduation here.” As the nationwide lockdown is expected to end on May 31, the centres have requested the government to allow them to function with full strength from June. “Even if the government allows us to resume operations with 30 to 50% of the total strength, it will not be beneficial for us as we have to increase staff strength for teaching the students in different batches, pay them salaries, GST, electricity bills and also monthly rent. Considering our plight, the government should let us function fully by next week,” said Mittal, managing director of visa consultancy-cum-IELTS centre, based in the Model Town marketASPIRANTS UNCERTAIN, BUT HOPEFULNIneteen-year-old Dimple, a resident of the Jalandhar Bypass area, who had enrolled abroad for electrical engineering, said things didn’t go as per her plan, but she had not lost hope yet. “My maternal uncle is based in Canada. I keep taking an update from him about the situation there. I will take up a job in the city till the situation,” she said. Lakhwinder Singh, 21, a resident of Jagraon, who had planned to go to Canada for pursuing his degree in designing by September, said considering the uncertain scenario due to Covid-19, he had decided to apply for the refund of college fee and postpone his plan for moving abroad till next year. “My parents are also concerned and don’t want me to go this year. Till the situation normalises, I will help my father in his business, but I won’t take admission here. I’m determined to complete my higher studies in Canada,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hit-hard-by-lockdown-ludhiana-s-ielts-visa-consultants-seek-relief-from-rent/story-jab7jkNW6v7cJTFhSvBmEJ.html

We got a request for 207 medical staff and their arrangements are being made in two institutes and four private hotels.”Muthe said arrangements have been made for staff working at Naidu Hospital, Kamla Nehru Hospital, Sanas Ground quarantine centre, Dropadabai Khedkar hospital and Sonawane hospital.Muthe said that along with accommodation, PMC has also made arrangements for food at these places.“PMC is in talks with more private hotels should the need for accommodation for frontline medical staff increase,” Muthe said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-allots-106-rooms-for-doctors-para-medical-staff-in-various-hotels/story-2SglYI7OIeG4s6ZkkqEqQI.html
27-05-2020||Mumbai||Cannot differentiate between contractual workers, employees working to contain Covid-19: HC to NMMC||Observing that it would be “extremely unfair and unjust” to differentiate between contractual workers and regular employees of the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) undertaking Covid-19 duties, the Bombay high court (HC) has granted interim relief to over 3,000 contractual workers by directing the corporation to pay them the special daily allowance of ₹300 which is being paid to regular employees and officers.A single bench of justice SJ Kathawalla, while hearing a petition filed by Samaj Samata Kaamgaar Sangh, a union representing over 6,000 contractual workers who undertake various civic duties for NMMC, was informed by advocate Bhavesh Parmar that the civic authorities were being unfair towards contractual workers. Parmar submitted that while NMMC was paying a special daily allowance of ₹300 to its employees and officers who were directly involved in Covid-19 containment duty, it refused to extend the benefit to contractual workers as they were employees of the contractor and not directly employed by the corporation.Parmar pointed out that while regular employees of the corporation were “fulfilling their responsibilities by risking their lives”, around 3,261 contractual workers/kamgaars involved in solid waste management, including day-to-day road cleaning and transportation of garbage; 693 kamgaars employed in the health department, which includes duties at four corporation hospitals and 23 urban health posts across Navi Mumbai, and 65 kamgaars employed on cemetery cleaning duty, were also risking their lives, hence refusal by the corporation to pay them the special daily allowance was discriminatory.In light of these submissions, Parmar sought directions to NMMC to not only pay the special daily allowance but also extend the benefit of the central insurance scheme for persons who succumb to Covid-19 while discharging their duty in containing the spread of the virus.On its part, the corporation, through advocate Sandeep Marne argued that as the kamgaars are employed by the contractors to carry out the work of the corporation, they are not entitled to claim parity and receive the said allowance which the NMMC has agreed to pay to its officers and workers.After hearing the submissions, the court observed, “In my view, the risk taken by the employees/workers/kamgaars in carrying out Covid-19 related duties for the corporation cannot be distinguished on their employment being directly with the corporation or through the contractors. In so distinguishing between its own employees and the kamgaars, the corporation is seen to be making a tacit statement, that the kamgaars, though discharging the [same] Covid related duties as the corporation’s own employees, are either not ‘risking their lives’, or despite doing so, need to be paid differently only due to their employer being the contractor and not the corporation. To say the least, this would be an extremely unfair and unjust yardstick to use to value human lives differently.”Thus saying, the bench passed an urgent interim order directing the NMMC to pay certified kamgaars the special daily allowance and posted the matter for further hearing on June 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cannot-differentiate-between-contractual-workers-employees-working-to-contain-covid-19-hc-to-nmmc/story-KxkHV9chKMOwmS2oim2AyI.html

The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has claimed that most nurses and doctors in these hospitals do not report for duty, burdening the remaining staff which affects the healthcare of the patients. Cases will be registered against doctors and not the hospital, for not reporting to work, clarified the corporation.The corporation has also chosen three medical officers, one for each of the three hospitals to make a list of doctors, nurses and other medical staff who do not report to duty.Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner of TMC said, “The staff including doctors and nurses from Kaushalya Medical Trust Foundation Hospital, Thane Healthcare Hospital and Horizon Hospital was reportedly absent from duty. We have appointed three medical officers, one for each of these hospitals who will make a list of these medical staff and register cases under section 188 (disobedience to follow orders) of the Indian Penal Code. Cases will be registered against the staff and not the hospital.”He said that as per their survey staff of three hospitals were found being absent from duty. Malvi added, “We have appointed few private hospitals as Covid hospital to effectively deal with the increasing number of Covid cases in the city. These hospitals are chosen along with their entire staff, we have issued directives that the hospital and the entire staff is appointed to provide treatment to Covid patients and should follow the guidelines of the corporation.” The private hospitals are facing severe crunch of nurses, doctors and other medical staff to tend to the increasing number of Covid patients.A spokesperson from Kaushalya Hospital said, “It is true that we are facing a shortage of nurses, Resident Medical Officers (RMO), doctors and ward boys. We had already informed the TMC regarding the issue and to take appropriate measures.”Corporation looking at five plots to set up hospitalsThe corporation has done a survey of five plots across the city to find a place to set up another Covid hospital to occupy an increasing number of patients in future. The corporation has at present undertaken a 1000 bed hospital in Global Impact hub in Saket and another in Wagale Estate. The civic commissioner on Wednesday did a survey of plots in Anandnagar, Ovala and Kasarvadali to find a suitable plot.Malvi added, “The commissioner surveyed Thane Municipal Transport (TMT) bus depot in Ovala-Anandnagar, Boriwade ground near Kasarvadavli, Police training academy in Saket, Irrigation department ground in Kharegaon and Mafatlal Compound in Kalwa East. He asked the concerned engineers to prepare a map of these plots and check their feasibility to set up a hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/action-against-doctors-and-nurses-who-do-not-report-for-covid-duty-tmc-chief/story-8AZMdHBSOpepDFujJPYveM.html

27-05-2020||Mumbai||Ozone concentration in Maharashtra cities spikes during lockdown||Despite a decline in vehicular pollution during the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in urban ground-level ozone, a harmful pollutant, across 10 Maharashtra cities, according to an analysis of the National Clean Air Program (NCAP).The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) comprising - Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Kalyan - witnessed a spike in urban ozone during the first three phases of the lockdown over two months (March 24 to May 24), according to an analysis released as part of the NCAP tracker on Tuesday by Mumbai-based air quality research group Respirer Living Sciences (RLS) and Delhi-based communications initiative, Climate Trends. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) confirmed the findings were accurate.Surface ozone (O3) is a photochemical oxidant, which is formed when volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) chemically react in the presence of heat and sunlight. Ground-level ozone is harmful for humans as it can aggravate asthma, cardiovascular diseases and other ailments.The latest study found a 10.3% rise in ozone across 10 Indian cities during the two month lockdown period. Among monitoring locations across Maharashtra, Khadakpada in Kalyan has shown the highest average ozone levels at 70 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m³) against the safe limit of 80 μg/m³ (for 24 hours), followed by the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation Khutala station in Chandrapur at 64 μg/m³. While the concentration ranged between 23-37 μg/m³ for MMR, a 50% increase in average O3 levels was witnessed when compared to 2019. Comparatively, a 50% reduction for Mumbai and 58% for Thane was witnessed for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels that comes mostly from burning of coal and vehicular exhaust.“The analysis indicates that when NO2 levels remain low, surface ozone is higher as photochemical production can become more efficient during summer months,” said Ronak Sutaria, founder and director, RLS. “Breathing air with high ozone poses a risk for people with asthma and other lung ailments especially for children, older adults, and those active outdoors such as daily wage workers.”MPCB said they were investigating the spike in the pollutant by comparing different station readings.“Based on our preliminary data collection, ozone is going up across Maharashtra cities,” said SC Kollur, chief scientist, MPCB. “It may be a secondary pollutant arising from the reduction of other major pollutants. Industrial areas do witness such spikes but the increase for major cities comes as a surprise. We have to analyse the source.” For Mumbai, MPCB plans to study background data from the Borivli station (near the national park) to check reasons for an increase in ozone. “The station data is down due to a broken cable for a week. The data is crucial as it gives background data and human induced emissions are not present,” said Kollur. All 10 Maharashtra cities are part of the NCAP where the Centre seeks to reduce pollutant concentrations by 20-30% by 2024 with the target pollutant as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). Data was compiled from state pollution control board monitoring stations over two months. The tracker is a web portal that monitors the achievement of state specific air quality targets for 122 Indian cities, and whether funds released for each city are being appropriately utilised. “Assessing how pollutants behaved during the lockdown the rise in ozone is an alert at a time when cities are already facing a health crisis. The findings should equip policy making and callsfor more studies to identify the impact of other pollutants apart from PM,” said Aarti Khosla, director, Climate Trends.A recent study by the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi and two Chinese universities also showed a 20% rise in ozone for western parts of India. The study suggested that secondary pollutants such as ozone need to be considered by NCAP. “China witnessed a similar rising trend for ozone and adopted measures to reduce the pollutant. India is already showing the indication of higher O3 when other pollutants reduce. During summer months, the Centre should consider precursors to ozone for non-attainment cities and in addition to PM, O3 has to be kept in mind while preparing action plans,” said Harsha Kota, professor, IIT-Delhi.NCAP apex committee and professor, Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur, SN Tripathi said, “Ozone has not been a problem in India over the years barring occasional spikes, which is regularly observed abroad across cities. An increase has been observed during lockdown due to its function as a precursor to declining NOx concentration but remained below safe limits. Ozone should be considered by NCAP as a secondary pollutant. Studies show PM followed by ozone contributes to 85-90% human related adverse health impacts. The current data is giving us the opportunity to understand O3 mitigation strategy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ozone-concentration-in-maharashtra-cities-spikes-during-lockdown/story-zMuEoy8e55Zeu2VjT9fI2H.html

27-05-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal BJP chief Rajeev Bindal quits week after scam in health dept||Shimla: Exactly a week after a medical equipment purchase scam surfaced in Himachal Pradesh and led to the arrest of then health director Dr AK Gupta, state Bharatiya Janata Party chief Rajeev Bindal resigned, citing moral grounds after the BJP’s name was dragged into the controversy.In his resignation letter to BJP national president JP Nadda, who had handpicked him for the post only in January, Bindal, 55, said: “I’m the president of the state party and we all want a free and fair probe into the alleged corruption without any pressure. In view of my high moral values, I am resigning from the post.”On May 20, the state vigilance and anti-corruption bureau arrested Dr Gupta for demanding a bribe of Rs 5 lakh after an audiotape of his telephonic conversation with a Renuka-based medical equipment supplier surfaced. The vigilance has sealed bank accounts of Gupta and his relatives and recovered documents of purchases made by the health department from his house.‘PARTY IS CLEAN’With the opposition Congress demanding a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation, Bindal said, “The state government acted swiftly and arrested the officer. The probe was promptly handed over to the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau. The BJP has nothing to do with this episode. The party is clean.”The five-time legislator and former health minister said that “pointing a finger at the BJP for this incident was not only injustice but an insult to the services the state government has provided during the coronavirus pandemic”.WAS UNANIMOUS CHOICE FOR CHIEF Bindal was formally declared state BJP chief on January 18 this year at a function attended by chief minister Jai Ram Thakur.His name was announced by national BJP secretary Sunil V Deodhar in the presence of Union ministers Ramesh Pokhriyal and Anurag Thakur besides outgoing state BJP president Satpal Singh Satti, who had been at the helm for eight years.Nadda had nominated Bindal for the post, considering his organisational skills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-pradesh-bjp-chief-rajeev-bindal-quits-denies-involvement-in-health-department-scam/story-ky2lMIfonkJJSFdjehxUeO.html
27-05-2020||Mumbai||Yes Bank Fraud: Wadhawans sent to judicial custody till June 11||The special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court on Wednesday remanded Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL) promoters Dheeraj Wadhawan and Kapil Wadhawan to judicial custody till June 11.The brothers were arrested on May 14 by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and have been in their custody since. As their ED custody ended on Wednesday, the two were produced before the special PMLA court. After completion of 14 days in ED custody, the agency sought for their judicial custody. The two would now be lodged in one of the jails in Mumbai.The Wadhawans were arrested by the ED over money laundering charges. The agency had initiated proceedings against them based on a first information report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on March 7, 2020, against Yes Bank promoter Rana Kapoor and the brothers. It is alleged that between April and June 2018, Yes Bank invested Rs 3,700 crore in short-term, non-convertible debentures of DHFL and Kapoor received Rs 600 crore as kickbacks from DHFL, in the form of loan advanced to two firms, DOIT Urban Ventures (India) Private Limited and Morgan Credits Private Limited. While Kapoor’s daughters hold 100℅ stake in DOIT, Morgan Credits is controlled by his wife.The Wadhawans, however, maintained that these transactions were entered into the regular course of business. They sought pre-arrest bail, claiming that there was no fraudulent misrepresentation and no wrongful loss was caused to the bank in the transactions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-fraud-wadhawans-sent-to-judicial-custody-till-june-11/story-QQC1IjI0aF5ctEIPc6q3HP.html
27-05-2020||Chandigarh||Cherries abound in Kashmir but farmers find no market||Cherry trees in Kashmir are blooming with luscious fruit but despite it farmers are staring at massive losses due to limited demand amid the Covid-19 crisis.The railways have stepped in to ease farmers’ burden. Jammu and Kashmir officials said they had requested northern railways to help transport Kashmiri cherries from Amritsar.Manzoor Ahmad Mir, deputy director horticulture planning and marketing, said, “From June 1, the Northern Railways will transport 4-6 metric tons of cherries daily from Amritsar to Delhi and Mumbai. We had requested them to transport the fruits from Jammu but that did not materialize.” FARMERS DEMAND FREE MOVEMENT OF TRUCKS Farmers have demanded free movement of fruit trucks till Amritsar.Mir said, “Kashmir has produced approximately 12,000 metric tons of cherry this year. Last year, the number was around 11,700 metric tons. The Valley annually sends around 3,500-4,000 metric tons of the fruit to other states.”Despite a good produce, famers are a worried lot due to decrease in demand due to closure of markets and difficulties in transporting fruit from farms to the markets amid Covid-19 restrictions.CHERRIES NOT FETCHING A GOOD PRICE “The market is down and we are not getting a good price for cherries. I received Rs 45-50/kg this year against last year’s Rs 75-90/kg. The shops and markets here are closed,” said Manzoor Ahmad Sheikh, a farmer of Lar Ganderbal in central Kashmir.There are four types of cherries in Kashmir- Awwal Number, Double, Mishri and Makhmali. The latter two are exported to other states.“This year we were hoping to get a profit from the cherry crop as the apple produce was affected due to bad weather during flowering. Our livelihood and the education of our children are dependent on this. If something is not done immediately our families will suffer,” Sheikh said. FRUIT MAY GO BAD Apart from the low demand, there are difficulties in transporting the fruit even inside the state triggering fears that the fruit will go bad if not harvested immediately.“Cherries are extremely perishable with a very brief shelf-life. We are unable to transport fruit as there are no movement passes. Those with passes are alos not able to move freely due to the lockdown,” said Pardeep Singh, whose family owns a farm in north Kashmir’s Baramulla.MATTER TAKEN UP WITH DIVISIONAL COMMISSIONER Deputy director Manzoor Mir said they had taken up the matter with the Kashmir divisional commissioner. “We have requested the divisional commissioner to prioritise fruit transportation and to ensure fruit trucks do not face any hindrance,” he said.Cherry are produced on an estimated 2,713 hectares of land in Kashmir and over the years the production has been increasing. From 8,282 metric tons in 2016-17, production increased to 11,280 metric tons in 2017-18 and to 11,789 in 2018-19.Not only are the farmers suffering because of low demand and difficulty in transportation, they are also facing logistical issues. NO PACKAGING MATERIAL “Fruit is ready but there are no cardboard boxes in the market to pack the fruit. Industries are closed so there is scarcity of boxes,” said Mudasir Ahmad Lone, a farmer from Baramulla.“The government should buy some fruit themselves and open industries and mandis,” he said.A senior official at the horticulture department, requesting anonymity, said they had already submitted proposals to the government for opening cherry processing industries.“We have around 25 cherry processing food units for canning of fruit. We have asked the government to provide transportation and packing to farmers besides permission for opening these units. The proposal for providing minimum support price to farmers was not passed. Let’s see what happens as time is running out,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cherries-abound-in-kashmir-but-farmers-find-no-markets/story-dnTH3xUsJqQpnpaLP1Vb2K.html
27-05-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka CM has betrayed people by not fulfilling 1,610 crore Covid-19 package promise: Siddaramaiah||Congress leader Siddaramaiah on Wednesday hit out at Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa-led Karnataka government for allegedly “betraying” the people by not fulfilling its Rs 1,610 crore Covid-19 package promise. Taking a dig at Yediyurappa over the matter, the Congress leader tweeted, “Chief Minister of Karnataka BS Yediyurappa has betrayed people by not fulfilling his Rs 1,610 crore package promise. He seems to be following his @BJP4India leader @PMOIndia @narendramodi.”“Crisis and vulnerability should not be misused for political gains and BJP for India is insensitive towards the same,” the former Karnataka Chief Minister said. On May 6, Yediyurappa had urged migrant workers to stay back as construction activities have resumed and announced a Rs 1,610 crores Covid-19 financial package for the state.“A package of Rs 1,610 crores will be released as Covid-19 financial relief. One time compensation of Rs 5,000 will be given to 2,30,000 barbers and 7,75,000 drivers,” the Chief Minister said. Referring to media reports, Siddarmiah cornered the state government for asking the licence to release funds for unorganised sector workers. “How can we expect washermen and other unorganised sector workers to have licence for their work?” he asked.It looks like Karnataka Chief Minister is very far from reality, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-cm-has-betrayed-people-by-not-fulfilling-1-610-crore-covid-19-package-promise-siddaramaiah/story-kQTC5VVq9nyJda9RRr3OuN.html

27-05-2020||Delhi||Video clip claims no arrangements on ground for Covid-19 patients: HC seeks Centre, Delhi govt stand||Taking note of a video clipping on social media of a man who had to run from pillar to post to get his mother hospitalised after testing positive for Covid-19, the Delhi High Court has directed the Centre and the AAP government to place before it arrangements made to deal with such patients.Observing that the video “raises serious issues of public concern in the present day context”, a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rajnish Bhatnagar issued several directions, including making effective the helplines for reporting coronavirus cases, assessing their adequacy to deal with the increasing call traffic and providing ambulance facility to pick up patients.It directed the two governments to place before it the status of functional and responsive helpline numbers being operated by them. It also appointed an amicus curiae to look into the grievances raised in the video clipping.“The amicus curiae shall also call the helpline numbers and report with regard to their effectiveness in providing help to the callers,” the bench said.   The court, which took suo motu cognisance of the clipping, also directed the Delhi government and the Centre to respond to the grievances narrated by the man -- Dharmendra Bhardwaj -- who has alleged in the video that “tall claims” of both the governments regarding arrangements for Covid-19 patients “are far from true on the ground”.He said his mother was admitted in a private hospital on May 19 and she tested positive for Covid-19 on May 21.Thereafter, the private hospital asked him to arrange for a ventilator and bed in some other hospital, he has claimed and added that he went to several hospitals, but to no avail.Even the helpline numbers publicised by the Delhi government and the Centre were non-responsive, Bhardwaj has alleged in the video which has been taken on record by the high court.Taking note of his grievances, the bench observed that a person, who or whose family or friend is found Covid-19 positive, should be able to call the helplines to not only report such occurrence, but to also seek guidance and assistance with regard to the hospitals to which such patient may be taken – if hospitalisation is necessary keeping in view of the condition of the patient.  “The helplines should render meaningful and effective help to the callers. If the experience of Dharmendra Bhardwaj is anything to go by, it appears, that this aspect has not been adequately addressed by the respondents (Centre and Delhi government),” the court said.It directed them to “assess the adequacy of the helpline capacity and state whether the same is sufficient to deal with the present call traffic and the traffic expected in the foreseeable future, keeping in view the continuous rise in the number of cases being reported each day”.   The bench was also of the view, “the helpline numbers of the GNCTD should also provide guidance and information to the caller as to which hospital has beds available for treatment of serious Covid-19 patients – both in Government and Private Hospitals, particularly in the proximity of the caller patient’s location.  “The capacity created to deal with calls made on the helpline numbers; the nature of assistance rendered, and the log maintained for the same, if any, should also be placed before the Court,” it said.The bench further directed the Delhi government to consider providing ambulance facility for pickup of Covid-19 serious patients for hospitalisation, once a caller reports a serious case which appears to require hospitalisation looking to the condition reported.  During the hearing, Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra told the bench that there were around 10 helpline numbers and admitted that they were “found not to be functioning efficiently and instructions have been issued to set the system in order”.  He told the court that the same would be done within the next couple of days. Mehra also informed the bench that a mobile application is under development to give live updates of the hospital beds available in Delhi government hospitals and private hospitals, and other related information.He told the court that the mobile application would be launched in the next couple of days. “We direct the Central Government, as well as the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi, to file their status reports on all the aspects mentioned in the said video recording and those taken note of by us, before the next date of hearing,” the court said. It directed the registry to place the matter on June 3 before the bench headed by the Chief Justice as it deals with PILs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/video-clip-claims-no-arrangements-on-ground-for-covid-19-patients-hc-seeks-centre-delhi-govt-stand/story-Q7EGfWNVVPvBjBBeYWh1fJ.html

Lieutenant Colonel Amit Dagar, IMA’s spokesperson, said the decision was taken “to ensure the health safety of the GCs and the staff” of the academy, one of the premier training institutes of Indian Army officers. “The PoP for the spring term will be held on June 13. However, this time the family members and the dear ones of the passing out GCs would not be able to attend the event at the academy due to the pandemic. This would likely be for the first time in our academy’s tradition,” Lt Col Dagar said.He said the institute will try that the event is covered as much as possible in real time. “Because this time the family members would not be attending the event, we would put in maximum efforts to ensure that it is covered extensively in real-time through media so that they could witness their dear ones gloriously passing out as officers of Indian Army,” the spokesperson said. The number of those who will join the parade will be “completely ascertained in a few days along with the decision of whom to invite as the reviewing officer of POP.”Before this, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) had conducted an e-passing out parade (e-PoP) for the first time in its history for 42 directly appointed gazetted officers, who joined the ceremony wearing masks and gloves, in April.The newly-inducted officers were at the force’s academy at Kadarpur in Haryana’s Gurugram for the webinar passing out parade held amid the Covid-19 lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/in-a-first-ima-to-hold-passing-out-parade-without-family-of-officers/story-orwbdzTJupyUHDOC5I5pEP.html
27-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab cabinet to meet today as impasse over CS prevails||Amid continued deadlock over the ministers’ demand for removal of the chief secretary, all eyes will be on the Punjab cabinet meeting scheduled to be held here at 3pm on Wednesday.The meeting has been convened to discuss the post-Lockdown 4.0 strategy, state finances and the hike allowed by the centre in the state’s borrowing limit, but the ongoing row between senior cabinet ministers and chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh is expected to be the hot topic of discussion.In the last cabinet meeting on May 11, the ministers had “unanimously” decided to boycott the chief secretary due to his “rude behaviour” with some of them, giving an ultimatum to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to remove the IAS officer from the top bureaucratic position or they will not attend cabinet meetings in which he is present.Though Amarinder took the luncheon diplomacy route and held meetings with cabinet ministers Manpreet Singh Badal, Charanjit Singh Channi and Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and some other MLAs in the past one week, the deadlock appeared to be unresolved.

27-05-2020||Lucknow||MNNIT develops mobile app to watch corona spread||A new mobile application, developed by Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT)-Allahabad for enabling district administration and corona control room to track spread of Covid-19 virus and suspected corona patients more effectively, was formally launched on Tuesday. Named ‘AMRIT’ (Assessment, Monitoring, Reporting and Intelligent Tracking), this mobile app would help chemist shops, medical practitioners and other organisations submit information about suspected corona patients easily to the administration or corona control rooms.The district magistrate Bhanu Chandra Goswami formally launched this app. “Administration was in touch with MNNIT for the last few days to develop the app which would help in preventing community level spread of COVID-19 infections”, said the DM. Earlier CMO Dr GS Bajpai had called representatives of Allahabad Medical Association (AMA), chemists shops and nursing homes owners to gather feedback for customising the app. ““We are hopeful that AMRIT app will be helpful to administration in tracking suspected corona patients with the support of nursing homes, drug dealers and ASHA workers”, said the CMO.The app would keep a track of people who are purchasing over-the-counter medicines for suppressing symptoms like cough, cold fever and unknowingly spreading the infection to those who are coming in their contact.The app is designed and developed by a team of faculty members of MNNIT including Ashutosh, Ambak, Sameer, NK Singh, Prof Shivesh Sharma, Prof Geetika, Vikalp Singh, Himanshu Kashyap and director of MNNIT Prof Rajeev Tripathi.The admin panel of the app will keep record and information about all the registered patients or customers, chemist shops, medical practitioners and other organisations like government offices, hospitals, nursing homes etc. The app also has ASHA workers registration feature and has been designed to help ASHA workers/ anganwadi workers in easily submitting the information to control room.“Whenever a patient with cough-cold-fever-breathing problem visits a clinic or purchases drugs, related to these symptoms, all the information like name, mobile number, address, date and time of prescription or sale will be sent directly to corona control room”, informed Prof Tripathi. The app has facility to directly scan the QR code from patient’s mobile and upload prescription which will save time in comparison to entering the details manually, however manual entry option is also there. The administration can track such suspected corona patients easily and testing can be performed which will save time and resources, he added. The app has been designed to facilitate door to door survey by health workers where they can easily send information about suspected corona patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/mnnit-develops-mobile-app-to-watch-corona-spread/story-hfqfCq5pQVLDQOKjfo5sMN.html

27-05-2020||Lucknow||Lady teacher gets clean chit in Pak glorification case||Police gave clean chit to a Muslim lady teacher, who was accused of glorifying Pakistan through her online teaching content, and said she posted the objectionable content owing to human mistake. The school teacher while teaching students online gave examples of proper noun like ‘I will join Pakistan army’, ‘Pakistan is our dear home land’ and ‘Rashid Minhas (Pak plilot) was a brave soldier’ but she emerged unscathed in the police investigation on Sunday as the probe found that she did it due to human mistake.The school teacher, Shadab Khan, a resident of Rahmat Nagar, was in the eye of the storm for sharing the controversial content on the school’s WhatsApp group, created for teaching students during the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, prompting netizens to call her ‘desh drohi’ or ‘anti national’. However, the teacher quickly clarified and posted a written apology for the ‘human mistake’.The teacher, while searching example of proper noun on Google, had found the content. She subsequently copied it and pasted it in the original form and forwarded it to her husband who converted it in PDF file and sent it back to her for sharing it with students in the WhatsApp group.In haste, the couple did not even bother to check the objectionable content, inviting anger of parents who complained it to the school authorities. The school authorities in turn lodged a written a complaint with police and also suspended the teacher beside serving her a show cause notice with seven days time to respond. A BJP leader also briefed media persons on the matter.On Sunday, the teacher along with her husband was called to Gorakhnath police station by CO Praveen Singh who with the help of cyber team got their mobile phones checked and recorded the statement of teacher only to find that the act was not intentional and was human mistake.“It has been found that carelessness on the part of teacher and human mistake led to the incident. As a teacher she should have been more alert.” CO Praveen Singh said.Teacher Shadab said, “I have tendered apologies before students who are like my children and also to the parents and school administration. It all happened just by mistake. However, if any evidence surfaces against me, I am ready to face any action. Hang me if I am guilty. I am an Indian and will die as Indian.”After she was given clean chit, local people and also those from Hindu community came out in support of women. They also demanded that her suspension should also be revoked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/lady-teacher-gets-clean-chit-in-pak-glorification-case/story-IHOByPUIwPUHZCh35fkuBL.html
27-05-2020||Lucknow||As curbs ease and life gets normal, air quality is back to ‘worst’||At least four Uttar Pradesh cities recorded the ‘worst air quality’ in the country, days after life started limping back to normal after lockdown curbs were eased by the government, claimed experts.Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Meerut and Bulandshahr recorded ‘poor’ air quality since May 24, according to the data released by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).All these places were among top five cities with worst air quality across the state.Bulandshahr recorded an AQI of 248 on Monday and was the second most polluted city.Muzzafarnagar, the other city in West UP, also recorded poor air quality. On Tuesday, the AQI of these places was recorded close to the ‘poor’ category.“The current AQI reflects on the increase in human activities like construction, vehicular movement and industrial work that affects the quality of air. Exposure to poor air quality for longer duration can lead to breathing discomfort,” said senior environmentalist Pramod Kamble. “We are experiencing the phase with the best air quality of the century,” he added. “The AQI will turn worse in coming days as more activities resume,” he addedThe depleting air quality has ended the longest streak of good air that Uttar Pradesh experienced in recent times during lockdown.Uttar Pradesh experienced the cleanest air of the century during the lockdown period caused by all time low vehicular movement, suspended industrial work and halt on construction activities.The state capital also recorded AQI as low as 70 during this period which reflected in the improved visibility of the city’s skyline.“One could see a highrise complex on Gomti Nagar Extension and Aliganj from Hazratganj. One can see the iconic clock tower in Thakurganj from almost five kilometers away. People who go out for a morning walk also claimed to experience better and cleaner air outside.“The air outside is light and cleaner. Breathing the clean air makes one lively,” said Dharampal Singh, a retired army veteran who goes out for a morning walk religiously.The AQI of Lucknow was recorded above 150 in the last few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/as-curbs-ease-and-life-gets-normal-air-quality-is-back-to-worst/story-u9X8WNjNdJo3Cgtcyhih0N.html

Mumbai, the country’s worst affected city, saw a drop in the cases in the last two days to 1,002 cases in the last 24 hours taking the tally to 32, 974 cases. The city, however, continued to record more than 1,000 cases over the last two consecutive weeks, even as the state government announced that it was chalking out the strategy to graded relaxations from the lockdown. Chief secretary Ajoy Mehta said that while the government was planning graded relaxations they also expected a surge in positive cases after the curbs are lifted.“There will be a surge in the positive cases after relaxations given in the lockdown. We are planning to ease out the restrictions in phase and calibrated manners to avoid a sudden surge and will be announced in stages. However, the health infrastructure is being ramped up to ensure surge was handled effectively,” he said at a press conference.He hinted that there would not be total lifting of lockdown after May 31.Of the 97 deaths on Tuesday, 39 were in Mumbai, 15 in Thane, 10 in Kalyan Dombivali, 8 in Pune, 7 in Solapur, 5 each in Aurangabad and Mira-Bhayandar, 3 each in Malegaon and Ulhasnagar, one each in Ratnagiri and Nagpur City. This month has seen 44,260 cases and 1,333 deaths in Maharashtra so far, which included 25,913 cases and 775 deaths in Mumbai. This means 80.83% cases and 74.39% deaths in the state have come in the past 26 days. The first case of Covid-19 in the state was on March 9.Mehta said that the removal of lockdown cannot be at one go. “The lifting of the lockdown policy is well thought through and based on the extent and acceleration of infection in particular areas. The relaxations will be informed well in advance to avoid panic moving out. The priority will be given to the necessities first and to the choice later while choosing the things that are excluding from the curbs. There will be a surge in the case once the curbs are lifted but we are ready to handle it with the help of awareness among people and the best medical advice, which is best in the world, is available to us,” he added. Mehta said that the relaxations in municipal corporations like Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon and Amravati were not given in the fourth phase even though they had less number of cases because the health infrastructure there was not enough to handle the surge after relaxations.According to officials, reconciliation of figures with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal is still in process, resulting in a difference in the cumulative figures.After having crossed 25,000 cases on May 13, the next 5,000 in the state were reported in just three days. The 40,000 mark was breached on May 21 in just five days and another 5,000 were crossed in just two days. The 50,000 mark was crossed on May 24, in just one day.

However, in a statement released by the office of the district magistrate Suhas Lalinakere Yathiraj on Tuesday, the radius of the containment zone will now depend on the number of cases.“In consultation with the state government, containment zones have been redefined for multi-storied buildings and societies in urban areas. If a single case is reported in a multi-storey society, only that particular tower will be sealed, and if more than one case is reported, the previous rule will be applicable according to which sealing radius will be 500 metre for containment and 250 metre for the buffer zone,” the order said.The order further stated that in case towers of the same society fall outside the 500 metre radius, they will not be considered as part of the containment zone.Residents of various high-rises have welcomed the district administration’s move.“It is very difficult for high-rises that have thousands of people living in them to have them sealed. It’s a question of their livelihood. People in hot spots cannot even get administrative passes. Not all societies have grocery shops within their premises, thus creating further problems,” Abhishek Kumar, president, NEFOWA, a Greater Noida West association of high-rises, said.The administration’s decision comes 24 hours after residents of Supertech Ecovillage had held a protest on Monday evening when their society had been sealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-revisits-containment-zone-plan-for-high-rises-to-seal-only-towers/story-u2wPUR60HRoZQnLqppmbQM.html

27-05-2020||Mumbai||27 Shramik trains depart from Maharashtra on Tuesday||Even as the state and the Union railway ministry continued to blame each other over the issue of Shramik Special trains for migrants, 27 trains left from various stations across Maharashtra until Tuesday evening with migrant workers to their hometowns. The railways said it was ready to operate 145 Shramik trains to ferry migrant workers back to their hometowns in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Kerala. However, in the evening, Union railway minister Piyush Goyal evening tweeted that of the 85 trains that were scheduled to be leave the state by 6pm, only 27 had been operated “due to non-arrangement of passengers by the state government”. “I request the Maharashtra government to please help us to take the poor labourers to their homes,” part of Goyal’s tweet read. According to Central Railway (CR), the first train left from the state at 12.30pm. “Eighteen trains had to depart from Maharashtra by noon, but the departure could not happen owing to lack of passengers. The first boarding for the train started at 12.30pm. The passenger movement is very slow on part of the state government.” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officers, CR.Home minister Anil Deshmukh however, has alleged that the railway ministry sent 34 Shramik trains to ferry migrants to West Bengal despite the eastern state requesting Maharashtra government not to send any trains until Tuesday in the wake of Cyclone Amphan. Deshmukh has said that WB chief secretary Rajiv Sinha had written a letter to the railway ministry on May 22 over the issue. “Now rail minister Piyush Goyal is blaming Maharashtra for not departing the trains notified to originate from our state. He should not indulge in this cheap politics,” Deshmukh has said.Maharashtra transport minister Anil Parab has also slammed the Centre and alleged that the trains were scheduled at the last minute to defame the state government and to depict its incapability. Parab has said that Maharashtra had sought 172 trains over the next few days, but after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s address, in which he said the trains are not enough, the railway ministry sent a schedule at 2.30am on Tuesday for trains to depart from Maharashtra before 12 noon.“The Railway ministry had sent the schedule at 2.30am for trains that left Maharashtra before 12pm the same day. The police personnel have been under stress owing to the Covid duty. It is not possible for trains to depart before 12pm at such a short notice. This has been done to defame the Maharashtra government and to show that the Centre is providing trains but the state is not able to send migrants,” Parab said in a video statement.The minister also alleged that the railway ministry provided 43 of the 48 trains together sought by the state, despite knowing that only two trains would leave for West Bengal due to the weather condition there. “In all, we had sought 48 trains for West Bengal to ferry migrants in the coming days, but 43 trains were scheduled for departure on a single day. The West Bengal government had requested us that only two trains daily will be allowed to enter to the state owing to the weather conditions there and we had accepted their request. By scheduling 43 trains, the Centre wants to portray that they want to provide trains but the Maharashtra government does not have the administrative strength to send migrant labourers.”Even as confusion over the departure of the trains prevailed, hundreds of migrant workers along wih their families gathered outside Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Lokmanya Tilak Terminus(LTT) and waited In queues to enter the railway station premises.State minority affairs minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik On Tuesday night asked Goyal to stop playing mind games. “Mr @PiyushGoyal, you said that you have alloted 49 trains for migrants from Lokmanya Tilak Terminus in Mumbai. The DRM at LTT says only 16 trains can be released.You must come clear on this issue, stop playing dirty politics and mind games. People have gathered there hoping that all 49 trains will leave as promised by you. You must now make sure that all 49 trains take these migrants to their respective destinations,” the minister tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/27-shramik-trains-depart-from-maharashtra-on-tuesday/story-MXvukWLArjyNPaMf2R0E2M.html
27-05-2020||Mumbai||Migrant, family survive only on water for 3 days||A migrant worker, his wife and their one-and-a-half-year-old daughter travelled from Mumbai to the village of Jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh (UP), surviving on nothing but water.Ashish Vishwakarma, a carpenter who lived with his family in Nallasopara and worked at Vidyavihar, had been out of work since March 22 because of the lockdown. With most of their neighbours returning to their villages, the Vishwakarmas decided to do the same. For Rs 6,000 he got a place on a truck for himself and his family, to make the journey to UP. He was told there would be 35 others in the truck, but ultimately, there were about 50 people. “The truck was to leave at night. Then there were rumours that they have found Covid-positive patients in my area so the truck left in a hurry in the afternoon,” Vishwakarma said. They left Mumbai on May 10 and in the rush, the Vishwakarmas were not able to organise any food for themselves. All the hotels along the way were shut and the family survived on only water for the duration of the journey. “We had some powdered milk for our daughter. We needed clean water to mix that also. She cried a lot all the way as it was unbearably hot,” he said.They reached Jaunpur on May 14. At present, the Vishwarmas are staying in a field adjacent to their house, to distance themselves from the rest of the family, which includes Vishwakarma’s two-and-a-half-year-old son who has been living in Jaunpur with his grandparents. In the village, the family is surviving on food they’d bought earlier. “We haven’t been buying vegetables. We don’t have any farmland in the village,” said Vishwakarma, who hopes to return to Mumbai once regular train services become operational. He said he has seen two to four trucks with migrants arrive in Jaunpur each day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/migrant-family-survive-only-on-water-for-3-days/story-eawmVvHuPr9SDAa2V61e2H.html

27-05-2020||Mumbai||First major locust attack in Maharashtra since 1993; 3 districts hit||Maharashtra is facing its first major locust invasion since 1993, with a swarm of short horned grasshoppers having invaded six talukas across three districts — Amravati, Wardha and Nagpur — in Vidarbha. While major food crops are not under threat, fruit orchards and vegetable farms are likely to be affected.According to the state agriculture department, the swarm is reported to be at least 10-km-long and two-km-wide, which has covered a distance of around 120km between May 24 and 26, and it continues to spread.The main affected areas include 22 villages across Morshi and Warud talukas in Amravati; Ashti taluka in upper Wardha district; and Katol, Kalmeshwar and Narkhed talukas in Nagpur. “The invasion began from Katol on Monday morning. While major crop damage is not expected since we are close to monsoon and sowing in these areas begins by June 7, but orange orchards are threatened by the invasion. A 25% loss is being estimated for those owning these orchards,” said Ravindra Bhosale, divisional joint director agriculture, Nagpur division. “The swarm is now moving further deeper into rural areas of Nagpur division. At Kalmeshwar taluka, on Tuesday, we were informed of damage to vegetable crops across 5-6 hectares,” said Bhosale.The last time Maharashtra witnessed such an invasion was in 1993 in Dhule district, the Locust Warning Organisation (LWO) under the Union agriculture ministry said. “An escaping population of desert locusts made their way from Madhya Pradesh into Amravati district on May 24 owing to the current wind direction and the presence of forest patches where they can grow and breed. Over 48 hours, they have covered two more districts, showing an unusual swarming behaviour,” said Dr KL Gurjar, deputy director and national coordinator on mitigating locust attacks, LWO. Subhash Nagade, divisional joint director agriculture, Amravati division, said, “There is fear and panic among villagers and farmers. With the Covid-19 pandemic underway and extremely hot weather in Vidarbha, the locust outbreak has made the situation worse. We are working with the municipal authorities for awareness drives across all affected areas.” Between Monday night and early Tuesday morning, district officials with the help of the fire department carried out a six-hour drive to kill the locusts by spraying pesticides on the affected areas in all three districts. “We learnt that the swarms move during the day and sleep on the fruit bearing citrus trees at night. Villagers informed us about their exact locations, and an overnight extermination drive saw thousands of dead insects across a 17-km stretch at Katol. However, on Tuesday morning, those that survived began swarming other talukas,” said Bhosale.Nagade said a similar thing was witnessed in Amravati. “The swarm has reduced here and moved towards greener pastures in Wardha and Nagpur. However, we fear the possibility of another swarm making its way from MP,” he said.“We are constantly in touch with local officers overseeing this. We expect the invasion to be controlled within a few days in Maharashtra. However, another escaping population from MP cannot be ruled out,” said GurjarThe country is witnessing a severe locust outbreak active across Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and now Maharashtra. These rapidly reproducing crop munching pests can eat daily amounts equal to its weight, and can fly up to 150km in a day. Central and state bodies have stepped up efforts to control the menace as it poses crop vulnerability and threat to food safety if the outbreak is not contained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/first-major-locust-attack-in-maharashtra-since-1993-3-districts-hit/story-hll1tdD0Hty70JvAlKAGXL.html
27-05-2020||Mumbai||Mahrashtra CM reviews state’s monsoon preparedness||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday reviewed the state’s monsoon preparedness and said that monsoon-related diseases should be dealt with in a competent manner. Thackeray, during a meeting with district administrations and other officials held via video-conferencing, sought for better coordination between all agencies to avoid flooding.The state health machinery is stretched too thin currently in combating the Covid-19 crisis. Communicable diseases during monsoon could further strain the health infrastructure in the state. The CM asked for division-wise and district-wise meetings with the doctors to ensure there are no cases of infectious diseases in the monsoon.“While we are fighting the Covid-19 crisis, communicable diseases during the monsoons will also have to be dealt with in a competent manner. The CM asked officials to ensure coordination between various agencies and take measures in advance to ensure that diseases would not spread,” a statement from the CM’s office said.For Mumbai, Thackeray stressed on cleaning and deepening of stormwater drains and ensure that there are no potholes in the city and in rural parts of the state.“It is important that stormwater drains in Mumbai be cleaned and deepened for the timely discharge of rainwater. Pumping stations must function properly. It must be ensured that pipes which discharge water are clean. It should be ensured that there are no potholes on roads in cities and rural areas, and these potholes, if any, must be repaired immediately,” the statement said.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar, minister of state for relief and rehabilitation Prajakt Tanpure, chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, divisional commissioners, along with officials from Indian Railways, navy, army, air force, coast guard and India Meteorological Department (IMD) were present in the meeting.The chief minister gave directions over the prevention of floods in Kolhapur and Sangli district like last year. He directed the officials to coordinate with Karnataka government on the release of water from the southern state’s Almatti dam. “To prevent a flood situation like last year in Sangli and Kolhapur, discharge of water from dams should be planned and regulated. The CM asked for coordination to be ensured now with the department concerned for the release of water from the Almatti dam in Karnataka,” the statement added.Thackeray said that though there are weather forecasts, monsoon may some times defy the forecast. He directed all agencies to coordinate with IMD. Referring to the Mahalaxmi Express train that was stuck in the inundated tracks during 2019 monsoon, Thackeray said that like flight operations take the weather into account, the railways must plan its journeys after looking at the weather forecast on the route.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mahrashtra-cm-reviews-state-s-monsoon-preparedness/story-UTlH2gXwpMpNz456l1akuM.html
27-05-2020||City||Don’t admit asymptomatic patients: Thane civic body to private Covid hospitals||The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has sent notices to the private hospitals dedicated for Covid treatment in the city on Monday, directing them not to admit asymptomatic Covid-19 patients and reserve the beds only for symptomatic patients. If private hospitals are found violating the rule, a case under the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Indian Penal Code (IPC) will be registered against them. The corporation said the step has been taken to increase the availability of beds in hospitals and put a check on private hospitals from fleecing patients. The city currently has 2,172 coronavirus cases but the hospitals have been finding it difficult to accommodate the growing number of patients. In the past few days, there have been reports of patients losing their lives owing to the unavailability of beds in hospitals.RT Kendre, officer on special duty for Covid, said, “As per the data, 70% percent of the positive patients are asymptomatic or have minor symptoms, while 15% patients recover without any medication. Ten percent of the patients, however, suffer from breathlessness or have other symptoms, for which they need to be treated in a hospital. However, we have observed that private hospitals admit patients who have no symptoms and charge them exorbitant fees, leaving symptomatic patients without beds.”A medical team has been appointed to keep a check on private hospitals and ensure that the orders are followed. The team will pay a visit to each of these hospitals to see if asymptomatic patients are admitted. The team will also have to present a report regularly to the health department.There are around 700 beds available at these private hospitals, of which 400 have been occupied. But according to a survey by the civic officials, only 150 of these patients are in need of treatment at the hospitals, as the others are asymptomatic, informed Kendre. “As per the notice, we will register cases under the Epidemic Act and the IPC against such hospitals who admit symptomatic patients. This decision will help increase the number of beds in the city and ensure emergency patients do not suffer and we can control the death rate. The hospitals will also have to discharge the asymptomatic patients if they are admitted. We also appeal the residents and the corporators to support the notice and not to insist on the admission of asymptomatic patients,” said Kendre.After receiving the notice, 147 asymptomatic patients were discharged on Monday and Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/don-t-admit-asymptomatic-patients-thane-civic-body-to-private-covid-hospitals/story-gjuJY1HvUwD28qpQyC9rVO.html
27-05-2020||Chandigarh||Two roads in Chandigarh’s Industrial Area to be widened for ₹10 crore by December-end||For decongesting the Madhya Marg and Dakshin Marg, and for improving the connectivity to Panchkula, the widening of two roads in the city’s Industrial Area, Phase 1, is slated to begin in a month’s time.The ₹10-crore project is scheduled to be completed by year-end.The first road connects the Poultry Farm Chowk (Junction 39 on the Dakshin Marg) to the Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) workshop in the Industrial Area. The second one runs parallel to Madhya Marg and Dakshin Marg, passing through the Industrial Area and connects Purv Marg to the Chandigarh railway station.“The road coming from the Poultry Farm Chowk will be widened by 14 feet, and extended from its current width of 40 ft to 54 ft. Six feet will be added on one side, and eight on the other,” said a senior UT engineering department official privy to the development. From CTU to railway station light point, the road will be widened by 6-8 ft.The widening of these two roads will considerably reduce traffic on Madhya Marg and Dakshin Marg, and support the new underpass to be constructed through the Chandigarh railway station connecting Chandigarh and Panchkula. The underpass is part of the railway station’s development and expansion plan. To be constructed by the railways, the 258-metre-long underpass will run from Garcha Chowk to Mauli Jagran. It is planned to be 5.5 metres high and 15-metre wide.CYCLE TRACK TOOIn addition to the widening of the road, construction of a cycle track from Junction 39 to CTU workshop is also part of the project. “While there is no space for a cycle track between CTU workshop and the railway light point, space for a track on the other road has been earmarked. It will be constructed alongside the relaying and widening road project,” the official said.36 NEW BUS LAYS TO BE CONSTRUCTEDFor better traffic management on city roads, the UT engineering department will be constructing 36 new bus lay-bys. A bus lay-by is a designated spot on the side of a road where buses pull out of the flow of traffic to pick up and drop off passengers. It is often indented into the sidewalk or other pedestrian walkway.The work on the ₹22-lakh project will start by June-end and is scheduled to be completed by September. The bus lay-bys will come up on Dakshin Marg, Shanti Path, near sectors 4, 27, 19, 21, 22, 23, 42, 51 and 46.“The department conducted a study and concluded that bus lay-bys were required at these spots otherwise stopping of buses was causing traffic jams here,” said the official.RENOVATION OF 80 BUS QUEUE SHELTERSThe UT engineering department will carry out renovation work of 80 bus queue shelters of heritage design at a cost of ₹20 lakh. The renovation will allow these shelters to be used for incorporating bus information systems under the intelligent transport system (ITS). The ITS is being developed under the aegis of the UT transport department. It allows for live updates on geo-location of the buses and display timings of arrival of CTU buses at the shelters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-roads-in-chandigarh-s-industrial-area-to-be-widened-for-10-crore-by-december-end/story-zW7aPr1l8l7yHA4bQRulRP.html

In a bid to ensure that lockdown orders are followed to prevent the cases from rising further, 170 RAF personnel will conduct marches in these areas every morning. A team of 60 personnel each will be deployed at Lokmanyanagar and Savarkarnagar and Wagle Estate areas, while 50 RAF personnel will be deployed at Mumbra. “Thane has a huge population and a high number of positive cases in the state. To ensure that locals follow the rules and additional manpower is available [to authorities], RAF teams have been posted at areas with more number of cases,” said TMC commissioner Vijay Singhal.“All the three areas are containment zones, where special rules ought to be followed to prevent the outbreak from spreading further. RAF personnel will help in ensuring that the residents follow law and order strictly,” said Balasaheb Patil, deputy commissioner of police, Thane. Mumbra, which will be under complete lockdown from Tuesday midnight, already has State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) personnel stationed from the past one month. “We had given a leeway to the residents during Ramzan, so that they could shop for groceries and fruits. However, with Ramzan coming to an end, we have to ensure that laws that come into effect during epidemics are implemented and followed strictly. So a team of 50 RAF personnel will also be monitoring the areas in Mumbra, in addition to the 120 SRPF personnel already deployed here,” said P Thorat, inspector, Mumbra police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rapid-action-force-deployed-at-3-thane-wards-with-high-coronavirus-cases/story-WkTsN5j2Lu3dU4nGTfyekK.html

27-05-2020||City||Maharashtra government got ₹28K-crore from Centre in three months to fight Covid pandemic, says Fadnavis||Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday hit back at the Thackeray-led government over claims that the Centre was biased against Maharashtra and had not given it enough assistance to tackle the pandemic.Fadnavis, who held a press conference, said the Central government had given the state financial assistance worth ₹28,000 crore over past three months to directly and indirectly, through foodgrains for public distribution system (₹19,000 crore) under the Garib Kalyan Yojana, direct cash assistance under PM Kisan Samman Yojana, Jan Dhan Yojana, besides assistance to procure farm produce (₹9,069 crore), relief camps and trains for migrant labourers (₹1,911 crore), assistance for health equipment such as purchase of PPE kits and N-95 masks (₹2,160 crore), devolution of taxes (₹5,648 crore), etc.Fadnavis said that he studied the central funds and assistance packages given by the Centre to Maharashtra to address “false claims and statements” being made in the media by those in the government. “Consistent efforts are being made in the state to show that the Centre has not been helping Maharashtra. The state is facing injustice at the hands of the Central government. This is completely false, but when fake statements are reiterated often a wrong perception can be created,” said Fadnavis.The MVA allies refuted Fadnavis’s figures as computation of Centre’s share in various schemes and taxes which is mandatory.The former CM also said the state could access nearly ₹78,000 crore of the fiscal package announced by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. While he said that not everything announced by Sitharaman could be divided state-wise, rough number-crunching showed that Maharashtra was poised to get big advantage from the package for Micro Small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), subsidies for housing and power sector.Making a case for the state government to take “bold steps” and raise loans, Fadnavis said the Centre had increased fiscal space for all states by increasing loan limit to five per cent of the GDP. He said this would enable Maharashtra to raise ₹1.60 lakh crore in loans from the market to tackle the pandemic, given that there would be a loss of nearly six months of goods and services tax (GST). “It’s not enough to say we don’t have money so we can’t announce package. If the RBI and the Centre is permitting you, bold decisions must be taken. Several states including Karnataka, Gujarat and even Congress-ruled Chattisgarh governments have announced a package,” he added.The state BJP unit has sought ₹50,000-crore package from the state for daily-wage earners and farmers.Overall, Fadnavis claimed the Maharashtra government can access ₹2.70 lakh crore of the Centre’s finances directly or indirectly. “No package has been given to the state. This computation of ₹28,000 crore includes share of the Centre in various schemes and taxes, which is mandatory for the Union government. This has not benefitted the government in any way to tackle the crisis,” said NCP spokesperson and minister Nawab Malik. He also slammed Fadnavis for advising the state to raise loans from the market.Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said Karnataka had announced a package worth ₹1,610 crore, Gujarat worth ₹670 crore, while Fadnavis had demanded ₹50,000 crore from the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-government-got-28k-crore-from-centre-in-three-months-to-fight-covid-pandemic-says-fadnavis/story-ilYT9ygqPPgFIYll0PtCnL.html

These water ponds are part of the measures taken by the zoo authorities to save animals from summer heat.“Our focus is to protect the cubs from the rising temperatures for which water ponds have been dug,” says zoo field director M Sudhagar.The zoo was closed on March 16 as a precautionary measure against the Covid-19 outbreak, thus giving the cubs and their mother Diya enough time to train without being exposed to human interference. Royal Bengal tiger Aman, father to the cubs, has had no interaction with them to date.With the changing temperature, the zoo authorities have made certain changes in the diet as well as the feeding time. “Frozen fruit ‘candies’ have been introduced for bears this year to enrich their dietary experience during summer,” says Sudhagar.“Papaya has been replaced with bananas and other seasonal water-based fruits, cabbage leaves make for spinach leaves, and radish has been replaced with cucumber,” he adds.These ice blocks are provided to each bear, every day. Water-based fruits such as watermelon have been added in the diet for monkeys, bears and elephants. Glucon-D powder is mixed in the drinking water of all the carnivores and omnivores to prevent dehydration.Sudhagar says, “Special seasonal arrangements are made for the animals on a case to case basis during summer to help them cope physiologically and for their better up-keep.”Desert coolers and air circulator fans are provided in the night shelters of all tigers, leopards, lions, bears and other large cats. Water ponds have been dug and natural cooling tubs have been kept in most of the enclosures to minimise the physiological effects of scorching heat. Water tankers and tractors are kept in standby to ensure an uninterrupted supply of water in the zoo.To keep the enclosures mosquito free, the windows have been covered with mesh. Shallow muddy pools have been created in elephant enclosure, Manipur deer enclosure, Swamp deer enclosure and deer safari for wallowing and mud bath. Concrete water pools are also being maintained round the clock as part of summer management activities.All bird cages have been covered with agro-net of 75% density and jute mats sprinkled with cool water to save birds from hot air and harsh sunlight and prevent heat stroke. “In a special measure for the aviary, misting facilities have been added for the free flying birds to dissipate the high body heat,” added Sudhagar.

He said the Thackeray government will complete its full term.On Monday, Pawar reached Matoshree – the Thackeray residence – after meeting Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. There were speculations that Pawar was not happy with Thackeray’s handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, while Thackeray was unhappy with Pawar’s stand to reopen economic activities in the state.Raut tweeted on Tuesday morning, “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar met at Matoshree last evening for 1.5 hours. There are some who are spreading false stories about the stability of this MVA govt. That is nothing but heartburn. This government is stable. Don’t worry.”Speaking to reporters in Mumbai later, Raut said: “This period during the pandemic is painful for the Opposition. Politics is in quarantine. They must be doing this [speculating about fall of the government] to kill time. The Thackeray government of the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena will complete its full term. There is no danger to the government. The Opposition should worry about their party. We have support of 170 legislators. The independents, which had backed the BJP, are in our contact. No legislator [from the MVA] will switch sides.”Raut, in his interaction with the media, said that Pawar met Thackeray to discuss the course of action for the state government and measures to be taken to tackle Covid-19. “If we take Pawar saheb’s suggestions and guidance on these matters, what is the harm? The country’s prime minister too takes his guidance, you all know that.”Responding to demands of President’s rule in Maharashtra, Raut said, “If the Opposition feels that enough is not being done to tackle the coronavirus outbreak and President’s rule should be imposed, Gujarat is a fit for it. The Gujarat high court’s observations are serious. The governor there should summon the [Gujarat] CM and the Opposition party in Maharashtra should go there and launch an agitation.”Nawab Malik, NCP spokesperson and minister in the state government, expressed confidence that the state government would complete its full term. “The government is strong and stable and the three parties are united. The numbers [of legislators] are in favour of MVA,” Malik told a channel. “Some people within the BJP have been spreading rumours since past few days that President’s rule will be imposed in Maharashtra, and that this government will collapse.”He added that the state government is handling the Covid-19 as per the guidelines of the Centre. “The Maharashtra government has been strictly adhering to the Centres guidelines on combating Covid-19. The number of people tested and traced in Maharashtra is highest in the country,” he claimed.Pawar, Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and other senior MVA ministers held meetings at the Bal Thackeray memorial site in Shivaji Park this month. Raut said that Pawar is a veteran leader, who had run the government in Maharashtra for several years and is an experienced administrator.The Thackeray government has been criticised by the Bharatiya Janata Party and Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis. The former CM had led an agitation against the government last week. Fadnavis is scheduled to address the media via video-conferencing on Tuesday evening.Former Sena leader and BJP leader Narayan Rane also met the governor on Monday and demanded the implementation of President’s rule in the state as the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government he said failed to tackle the crisis. He also demanded all government hospitals should be taken over by the military as the present system has failed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pawar-raut-refute-bjp-s-claims-of-instability-in-maharashtra-say-government-will-complete-full-term/story-yfxtc5ba2IsPYXjp40s7ZP.html
27-05-2020||Chandigarh||Rupnagar residents up in arms over water shortage||Residents from various localities of Rupnagar, who said they are facing water shortage for the last two weeks, staged a protest outside the office of Punjab water supply and sewerage board, on Tuesday.They said localities including Ali Mohalla, Chhota Kheda, Mil Mil Nangar, Preet Colony, Nehru Nagar, Bhandari Chowk, Uchha Khera, Mata Rani Mohalla and Malhotra colony were receiving no water.The residents said they had sought answers from the municipal council, as the civic body is responsible for supplying water in the town. However, residents said MC officials told them that the board didn’t release sufficient water, which is causing the shortage.On the other hand, officials of the MC and water supply and sewerage board were seen passing the buck from one shoulder to the other.Assistant municipal engineer Kuldeep Aggarwal said that though the Punjab Water Supply and sewerage Board set up a ₹56 crore project including over water head tanks; but, there was no plan to increase the quantity of water to be supplied in the town.On the other hand, the board’s officials claimed tenders for work to increase water supply could not be floated amid the lockdown, resulting in the shortage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rupnagar-residents-up-in-arms-over-water-shortage/story-IgIPqTtViUM4ICqpAP5HPM.html

27-05-2020||City||6 positive, 4 negative Covid test reports raise questions over sampling process||Inconsistencies which emerged in the sampling results of a Covid-19 patient from Hisar have raised questions on the testing process of the state health authorities.The 29-year old patient was subjected to 10 tests to check the presence of coronavirus in his body over a month. The man was in for an ordeal as he tested positive in six and negative in four reports. The uncertainty over his Covid-19 status continued for a month before he finally walked out of the isolation ward of Maharaja Agrasen Medical College, Agroha, on Tuesday as a corona-free man. The inconsistencies in the outcome of the tests have been puzzling even as his month-long fightback after returning from Ghaziabad is inspiring. The patient, who is a resident of Hisar, also wrote an email to health minister Anil Vij on May 22, raising questions over the testing process. He told the minister that two days after he returned from Ghaziabad on April 23, where he runs a transport business, he was tested positive for coronavirus and sent to the isolation ward of Agroha medical college. As per his email, his first three samples were tested positive for Covid-19, while his fourth and fifth samples tested negative. He said he was still asked to stay at the hospital’s isolation ward. “On Tuesday, one month and four negative tests later, I finally returned home. I do not understand that despite testing negative for a couple of times and being asymptomatic, why was I kept in the isolation ward for so long. However, I will remain quarantined in my home just for the safety of my pregnant wife and other family members,” the patient said.Dr Yogesh Sharma, chief medical officer of Hisar civil hospital, said there is no difference between the tests conducted at Hisar’s National Research Centre on Equines (NRCE) and Rohtak’s Post Graduation Institute of Medical Science (PGIMS). “In some cases, a patient might even take 40 days before his report turns out to be negative. It depends on the body’s immunity,” Sharma said, adding that in most of the cases, patients are asymptomatic. Haryana’s nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Dhruv Chaudhary also ruled out any difference between tests conducted at NRCE and PGIMS. “Though, there are different types of methodology for examining samples for Covid-19. There is a difference in sensitivity of kits as well. Some people take 10 to 14 days before their reports come out negative, while some may take up to six weeks. Positivity in the tests simply means that there is presence of the virus in the body.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/6-positive-4-negative-covid-test-reports-raise-questions-over-sampling-process/story-zsK81qVVnteUN4VOcsqT7M.html

27-05-2020||Chandigarh||Arbitral tribunal slaps ₹1,737-crore damages on HSIIDC||In a blow to the state government already struggling with finances, a three-member arbitral tribunal has ordered Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC), a government owned public limited company, to pay ₹1,737 crore damages to IDBI Bank.IDBI was the lead banker to have financed the Kundli Manesar Palwal (KMP) expressway project before the concession agreement with the initially appointed contractor was terminated in March 2015 on account of default. The fresh financial burden comes at a time when owing to Covid lockdowns the state government is dependent on market borrowings to raise resources for running its day to day affairs and the HSIIDC is also facing financial crisis on account of huge accumulated debt and annual interest burden of Rs 1000 crore.The bank had filed a case before the tribunal stating that HSIIDC had in 2015 awarded the execution of the balance work of the expressway to two contractors in utter disregard of rights of senior lenders and in breach of its obligation under the substitution agreement and other financing documents. The substitution agreement conferred a right to senior lenders to step in or substitute the contractor.The tribunal comprising three former Supreme Court judges – Justices RM Lodha, KS Panicker Radhakrishnan and J Chelameswar – in its March 24 order said had HSIIDC not acted in breach of the substitution agreement, the new concessionaire while getting the contract for completion of the balance work would have taken over the liability relating to the dues of senior lenders arising from the loan disbursed to the project contractor. Actually, this is the amount claimed by the IDBI as damages, the tribunal held.“The IDBI Bank is thus entitled to damages amounting to ₹1,737 crore from HSIIDC to offset the loss suffered due to breach of the substitution agreement. The extent of damages is the total principal amount outstanding as on May 31, 2016, (₹1,027 crore) and the interest during this period amounting to ₹709 crore,” the order said.“The sum would be paid in four equal instalments of about ₹434 crore on or before June 30, 2020, September 30, December 32 and March 31, 2021.When asked about the payment of damages to the lending banks, HSIIDC managing director Anurag Aggarwal said the board of directors has decided to challenge the arbitral tribunal orders in Delhi high court.The tribunal also said that HSIIDC will be entitled to reimbursement of such amount from IDBI which it would recover from KMP Expressways Ltd, the SPV appointed for implementing the project, towards its outstanding dues pursuant to the orders of the debt recovery tribunal.The previous Congress regime had proposed ₹1,300 crore payment for terminating the concession agreement with the then contractor of the e-way project.The project, which was first allotted to M/s KMP Expressways Ltd during the Congress rule, had got derailed as it was mired in legal and financial complications. Looking for a “bail out”, the then Congress government decided to go beyond the provisions of the concession agreement, thereby terminating the deal with mutual consent and giving the project to a new company.As part of the bail-out plan, the previous government had also decided the termination payment of about ₹1,300 crore to be paid to M/s KMP Expressways and the project lenders by the new company. The ₹1,300 crore fixed as termination payment was on account of the work done on the delayed project by the then contractor. The BJP government, however, rejected the ₹1,300-crore payment, saying the project cost was less than that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/arbitral-tribunal-slaps-1-737-crore-damages-on-hsiidc/story-lNwBtDSQDa05AZGqYjORZJ.html

The monthly expenditure on clearing pensions is ₹4.5 crore.As per the budgetary proposals for 2020-21 fiscal, the university is expected to generate an annual income of ₹218.3 crore from academic fees and registration charges.“It is sad on the part of university authorities to demand semester fee from students by June 8 to meet its committed expenses. Moreover, the varsity is putting a financial burden on the students and their parents at the time of pandemic, which has already affected the savings of every household,” said Varinder Khurana, state secretary of All India Students Federation.He added that the varsity has also advanced the last date of submitting fee by June 8 as earlier the semester fee was charged in July.In a notification issued by the varsity, fee deposited after the due date will attract fine.On the other hand, pensioners say this is for the first time in the history that the varsity failed to clear their monthly dues.“It seems that the varsity is going through a financial crunch as fee as it has to depend upon students to pay salaries and pensions. If the situation persists longer, the employees will not be paid in the coming month too,” said a senior professor who returned recently.It may be mentioned that the varsity has failed to implement the repeated orders of the Supreme Court and the high court to ensure that pensioners are paid between the 7th and the 10th of each month. For not doing this, the university has to pay 10% interest.Varsity registrar Prof Manjit Singh Nijjar said the pensions were delayed due to dearth of funds. “We are still waiting for the funds. On the notification regarding fee submission, he said even that shall not serve the purpose and the university might consider changing the dates for depositing semester fee,” Prof Nijjar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pbi-varsity-fails-to-pay-pensioners-for-april-advances-semester-fee-date/story-5jgcOIt7BnP9SGzov4VrqI.html
27-05-2020||City||15 returnees test positive in a day in Mahendergarh||Mahendergarh district on Tuesday witnessed a spike in Covid-19 cases after 15 persons, who had returned from other states, tested positive on Tuesday.So far, the district has reported 36 cases, which include 34 returnees, a Mahendergarh resident who had brought his father, a Rajasthan Police employee from Delhi, and his one contact. The district has 30 active cases and 6 patients have returned home after recovery.Mahendergarh civil surgeon Dr Ashok Kumar said the district reported 15 cases on Tuesday, and all of the infected persons had returned home from other states recently.“The new cases have been reported from 13 different villages and one patient belongs to Adarsh Nagar in Mahendergarh. The patients had returned from Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The cases include a barber, two Delhi Police cops, a 23-year-old student, two health workers, a tailor and carpenter and among others whose professions are yet to be ascertained,” the civil surgeon said.He said all the new patients except a Delhi policeman, who had returned on May 23, have been admitted to the isolation ward of the Covid-hospital in Narnaul.MAHENDERGARH SAW 36 CASES IN 19 DAYSMahendergarh had recently become the second district in Haryana to lose the green zone tag on May 8 after two government railway police (GRP) personnel tested positive for coronavirus disease.However, before May 8, Mahendergarh district administration was being praised for not letting the deadly virus enter its territory even though it shared border with Rajasthan.SURVEILLANCE HELPED IN DETECTING CASESThe civil surgeon said proper surveillance and testing has helped the district administration in detecting the infection among people returning from other states.“People coming from other states are being monitored by doctors and health workers. We have asked the returnees to strictly go into home quarantine and approach us if they notice any symptoms of Covid-19. All the patients, except one of the contacts of an infected man from Mahendergarh, had contracted the disease in other states before returning home,” Dr Kumar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/15-returnees-test-positive-in-a-day-in-mahendergarh/story-xlHEhAR3SRwQXAqn0FzzNI.html
27-05-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 brings fresh challenges for Maharashtra’s MVA govt||The Uddhav Thackeray-led government in Maharashtra is feeling the heat over the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the rise in the number of cases and fatalities. The state now has 54,758 Covid-19 cases, with Mumbai making up nearly three-fourths at 32,974 cases.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday hit out at the Thackeray-led government with former chief minister and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis alleging the Thackeray-led government has lost its grip on the situation and Maharashtra needs “assertive leadership and bold decision-making”. In an online press conference on Tuesday evening, Fadnavis pointedly ruled out the claim that his party was making any attempts to bring down the government. “In Mumbai, people are dying on the streets, hospitals are overcharging ... The numbers of cases and fatalities are alarming. On an average, we have done 3,500 tests every day for the last month and we have case positivity of 32% against the national average of 4.5%,” said Fadnavis. “We are not a part of these statements or discussions. We are in no rush to form the government. We are focussing only on battling the coronavirus. The governor makes observations and independently reports to the Centre. We will continue to pressurise the government to wake up and address the grim situation before them...This government will fall on its own due to its internal contradictions.”BJP MP Narayan Rane (who met the governor on Monday), sought President’s rule or Army’s help to tackle the situation.There have also been hectic movements in the Raj Bhavan over last week, starting with Fadnavis leading the ‘Maharashtra Bachao’ agitation to governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari complaining against the state to NCP chief Sharad Pawar paying a “customary visit” and Rane calling for dismissal of the government. What has worsened the situation and public perception for Thackeray was Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s statement that his party was part of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi, but did not have a significant say in running the government. The Congress is part of the MVA government with 11 ministers in the Thackeray’s cabinet. “We are only supporting the government and are not a key player,” said Gandhi. Fadnavis slammed the statement and said the Congress was shirking its responsibility.Clarifying on claims of bias, Fadnavis said the Centre had given the state nearly ₹28,000 crore in the past three months through food subsidies, devolution of taxes, direct benefit transfer, assistance for migrant labourers and health equipment. Both NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Sena MP Sanjay Raut rebuffed the claims of “instability” and “inefficiency”. Pawar said, “There are no differences in the MVA, there is no doubt that the government will last the entire term. It’s surprising that the BJP thinks the government in unstable. The meeting with the governor was customary. We are all focussing on coronavirus pandemic.” In an interview to NDTV, he also slammed Fadnavis for being “impatient”. “This period is painful for the Opposition. Politics is in quarantine. They must be doing this [speculating about the fall of the government] to kill their time. The Thackeray government of Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena will complete its full term,” said Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, speaking to reporters on Tuesday. He added that Pawar met Thackeray to discuss the course of action for the state. “What is the harm in taking Pawar saheb’s suggestions and guidance on these matters? As you know, the country’s prime minister too takes his guidance.”Pawar met Thackeray for 1.5 hours. This was his third meeting with the chief minister in recent weeks.Responding to demands of President’s rule in Maharashtra, Raut said, “The situation in Gujarat is perfect for President’s rule. The Gujarat high court’s observations are serious. The governor there should summon the [Gujarat] CM and the Opposition party in Maharashtra should go there and launch an agitation.”The state Congress also slammed the BJP saying they must first focus on their own states of Gujarat and UP.Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the Gujarat High Court had remarked that the hospitals in Ahmedabad were “as good as dungeons”. “Even advocate general of the Gujarat government has admitted in his affidavit submitted to the court that the government was testing less as they fear that 70% of the population in Ahmedabad will be revealed infected if the tests are done. This means a minimum of 40 lakh people in Ahmedabad alone are infected people. The situation in other BJP-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh is no different,” said Sawant.NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik rushed to the defence of Gandhi and said there was nothing wrong in his statement. “It is a coalition government of three parties and we are all working together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tough-times-ahead-for-maharashtra-cm/story-K7PMI8pQPLv8Glu3asezFO.html

The purpose of taking samples is to check the level of immunity of the people against Covid-19.”“The team will take a total of 400 samples. It will then separate plasma from the blood and send it to the ICMR’s Chennai-based institute for analysis at the central level. This analysis will make it easier to understand the extent of antibodies in humans in the district,” said Dr Bagga.“From the survey, the team will also assess as to what stage the exposure of coronavirus has spread in the community. The survey report will be compiled at the national level followed by the statewide data,” he added.The civil surgeon said only four districts of Punjab were selected for the survey. The survey was first conducted in Patiala, followed by Jalandhar and then in Gurdaspur. Now the survey was being carried out in Ludhiana, he said. The team is covering 69 districts of 21 states of the country. The districts have been selected by the ICMR through GPS based cluster selectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/icmr-team-takes-blood-samples-to-assess-ludhiana-residents-immunity-against-coronavirus/story-CgmA3LxxlD5SWZbhCQWDWM.html
27-05-2020||Delhi||250 homes gutted in Tughlaqabad fire||A fire in a slum in South Delhi’s Tughlaqabad in the early hours of Tuesday destroyed at least 250 homes. Social distancing norms, in place to control the spread of Covid-19, were ignored as the tragedy left many with just the clothes on their backs.Authorities said there were no casualties in the fire and that it was likely caused by a short-circuit.According to Atul Garg, chief fire officer (Delhi Fire Services), the fire broke out around 12.45am in Tughlaqabad village . The department deployed 28 fire tenders that took four hours to douse the flame and another two hours to finish the cooling operation.“The operation was difficult because the slum is on a hilly terrain, the area is poorly lit and the materials with which the homes were constructed were highly inflammable,” said Garg, adding that there was no real threat of his men contacting Covid-19 as they didn’t have to rescue the residents who had escaped by then.The impact of the blaze was such that exploding cylinders flew across a wide road, affecting a smaller cluster of jhuggis on the other side. RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east), said: “We are yet to ascertain the trigger for the blaze, but we suspect it was due to short-circuit. We are registering a case.”Rinku Mandal, a scrap dealer, said that dense smoke woke her up. “I had withdrawn all my savings of ₹16,000 when the lockdown began. While trying to save my three children from the fire, I forgot about the notes,” she said, holding a plate of yellow rice in her hands.There were many like Mandal and even more like Ram Phal, a restaurant employee who lost 35 kg of rice and wheat. “Many of us had hoarded food to keep us going during the lockdown,” he said. His family now took shelter under a cloth supported by four sticks.Many wished they had returned to their home villages after the lockdown was imposed from March 25 to control the spread of Covid-19. “I stayed back in the hope that the lockdown would be lifted. I returned to work as a domestic help just a week ago, but now I am back to where I was when I moved to Delhi four years ago,” said Aklima Khatoon, a 45-year-old woman.People from the neighbourhood came out to provide relief. Mazhar Alam, a teacher, and his friends collected ₹6,000 from the neighbourhood colonies to prepare food and buy water. Kakoli Das, a domestic help, collected used clothes to distribute to the slum dwellers.“We tried to practice social distancing all this while, but now it may not be possible anymore,” said Parvez Ali, an e-rickshaw driver who allowed a family of four to move in to his home. A few unaffected homes that were unoccupied -- their owners had returned to their home towns and villages during the lockdown -- were quickly occupied by those affected.By early afternoon, the government began setting up tents to serve as a temporary solution.“We are trying to ensure social distancing. We’ll provide them space and meals till the time they can rebuild their homes,” said BL Meena, sub-divisional magistrate of Kalkaji.By late afternoon, the Delhi government announced a financial aid of ₹25,000 to each affected family. The families will be provided food and accommodation in the nearest government school, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said.A few slum dwellers, meanwhile, tried to salvage whatever they could from the burnt debris. “I have collected all the burnt items from my jhuggi.

27-05-2020||Noida||Borders turn choke points as UP tightens travel rules||Long traffic jams were reported on Tuesday from Delhi’s borders with Noida and Ghaziabad as the Uttar Pradesh government tightened restrictions on the movement of commuters in a bid to contain the spread of Covid-19 infections in the state.At UP Gate near Ghazipur, where Ghaziabad shares a border with east Delhi, commuters were stranded after the police did not allow people, barring exempted categories, to enter the capital on district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey’s orders .The Ghaziabad administration had on Monday again restricted movement between Delhi and Ghaziabad, citing an increase in Covid-19 cases with links to Delhi, especially since the beginning of May.“There were jams at the border as we conducted checks in compliance with the district magistrate’s order . We have opened the UP Gate and Anand Vihar-Kaushambi border, but people are allowed passage to Delhi only on the basis of passes issued by the administration,” Anshu Jain, Indirapuram’s circle officer, said.“So far, we have allowed passage to vehicles involved in essential services at UP Gate,” she said.Jaivir Singh from Vaishali in Ghaziabad, one of those stuck at UP Gate on Tuesday, said he was not allowed entry to Delhi.“I was sent back by cops who said I need a pass to go to Delhi. The Delhi government opened its offices and the Ghaziabad police are not allowing us to cross the borders even though I showed them my official ID,” Singh, who works with the municipal corporation of Delhi, said.Neeraj Kumar, who works with a private company in Lajpat Nagar said: “The police did not allow me entry to Delhi and I had to return home,” Kumar, a resident of Sanjay Nagar, Ghaziabad, said. Vehicles engaged in essential services have been allowed to move without any restrictions while doctors, paramedics, police and bank employees will be asked to produce their identification cards.Likewise, media persons and lawyers can also cross by showing their identity cards. Employees of private firms with offices in Delhi will have to apply for passes.At the Noida border, snarls continued at all three border checkpoints with Delhi -- the DND Flyway, Kalindi Kunj, and Mayur Vihar -- especially during peak hours. Despite relaxations in the fourth phase of the lockdown allowing interstate movement of public, the Gautam Budh Nagar administration continues to keep its border sealed, allowing only vehicles of essential services, lawyers, travellers with confirmed tickets and people with administrative passes to pass through.“Traffic volume has gone up since all offices in Delhi and Noida are now open and to manage the situation, we have opened more lanes on DND Flyway (the access-controlled highway connecting Delhi and Noida). But there are still many people out there who are trying to travel without any particular reason,” deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Sankalp Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jams-continue-at-noida-ghaziabad-borders/story-kd2lxwd0L7mUhKWfw8pdlK.html
27-05-2020||Delhi||First case in IGI air traffic control after staffer tests +ve, 17 in home quarantine||A Delhi air traffic controller tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, the day domestic flight services partially resumed after two months, since the nationwide lockdown to control the disease was enforced. Air Traffic Control (ATC) officials said flight operations were unaffected as they had measures in place to prevent such an outbreak and contingency plans in case an outbreak occurs in this critical arm of the airport.The new ATC duty roster, in place to control the spread of infection among employees, gives at least 10 days’ rest to each controller. Senior officers said the infected controller was last on duty on May 17. With airport services yet to fully resume, only minimal staff members are required to keep operations running. Vineet Gulati, member, Air Navigation Services, said keeping in mind the sensitivity of their job, they had enforced strict social distancing measures. “The infected controller had first tested negative for the virus, but then a second test returned positive on Monday. He is asymptomatic and under home quarantine. Seventeen other ATC officers who came in close contact with him have been asked to quarantine themselves at home,” he said.An ATC official, who asked not to be named, said the officer may have contracted the disease from his daughter, who had tested positive for the virus earlier. Authorities have since sanitised the main access areas of the 26-storey control tower. The Delhi ATC has a strength of around 400 controllers and handles at least 1,300 flight operations every day on average in normal times. On Monday, the first day of resumption of services, around 380 flights (both arrivals and departures) were scheduled to take place, of which 82 were cancelled. On Tuesday, the airport saw 137 departures, 147 arrivals and 25 cancellations.ATC officials said the new roster has been in force since March when flight operations were suspended in the country in view of the lockdown. “Earlier, 60 controllers used to work a shift, but from March, this was down to only 20 per shift. From the March 25 to till May 25, flight operations were not even 5% of what we usually handle, so 20 controllers are enough to do the job. We are keeping 40 controllers on standby at any given time. If any controller shows signs of an illness, we can ask the entire shift to quarantine themselves and a fresh lot of controllers can take over without delay ensuring round-the-clock operation of the ATC,” an ATC officer, who did not wish to be named, said.Gulati said strict social distancing is in force at the control room. Another ATC officer said a number of precautions and sanitisation measures are in place to ensure minimal chance of infection. “If the ATC is crippled due to the infection, it will be another jolt to the aviation sector that has just resumed partial services. If cases multiply at some pace, it will be difficult for us to fill in for the controllers. Following the safety guidelines, we have placed self-dispensing hand sanitisers, the entire building is fumigated and workstations are cleaned after every shift. All controllers are required to wear masks and gloves while working. Even in other areas, physical distancing rules are being followed and our staff is seated at an adequate distance from each other. All necessary measures are being taken,” said the second ATC officer requesting anonymity.The new protocols, however, do not require officers to test themselves for Covid-19 before attending to their duties.In the last 24 hours, at least 18 central industrial security force (CISF) personnel deputed at the airport also tested positive for the virus.“All were at the CISF’s isolation facility for the last 10 days. Contact tracing is being done and their families have also been asked to quarantine themselves at home,” said a CISF spokesperson, adding that the force now has 54 confirmed cases in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-air-traffic-control-reports-first-coronavirus-positive-case-17-quarantined/story-eAnkBefTqVGV66LBHIIwoL.html

On Tuesday, another 18 trains left Delhi with around 30,000 more people… The highest number of trains have left for Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, and then to other states that include West Bengal, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh,” said Sisodia.He further said, “All passengers are screened at designated centres and only asymptomatic individuals are allowed to travel, after a list is prepared. Other than paying for their train tickets, the government also provides them food and water.”Under the rules drafted by the central government, the states send requests for trains to specific destinations to the Union rail ministry. “We want to tell people that we have adequate arrangements for them in the city in terms of food and shelter. If they still want to go, we request them to apply for trains through the government portal instead of starting journeys on foot,” said Sisodia in a video press briefing.He also said the city currently has 2,500 hunger centres that provide people in need with meals twice a day. “The number of people in hunger centres is slowly reducing, with more migrants leaving the city,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/around-271k-migrants-have-left-delhi-aboard-214-special-trains-sisodia/story-kDPumJxwNB4EzRHlPMyIjP.html

27-05-2020||Pune||Pune radio telescope helps discover new class of powerful astronomical explosions||The Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) near Pune, operated by the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (NCRA-TIFR), has helped a team of international scientists discover a new class of powerful astronomical explosions caused by a Fast Blue Optical Transient (FBOT) named CSS161010..While supernova- the super-powerful explosion of a star- is the biggest explosion seen by humans- the discovery of the FBOT named CSS161010 in late 2016, and follow-up radio and X-ray observations, revealed that it is more powerful than a normal supernova, NCRA scientist Poonam Chandra said at a press conference here on Tuesday. “What makes these luminous FBOTs unique is they prima facie look like supernova explosions, but flare up and vanish much faster. They’re also extremely hot, hence appear more blue in color than the standard supernovae, the NCRA scientist said. This FBOT can eject large amount of material into space-- 1 to 10 percent the mass of the Sun-- at speeds close to half the speed of light, thus proving to be a new class of transient,” she said. “CSS161010 is the second closest FBOT and lies at a distance of around 500 million light years,” said Deanne Coppejans, a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern University. Data from the GMRT along with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at Soccorro, New Mexico and the Chandra X-Ray Telescope deployed on the space shuttle Columbia, was used for the research into this astronomical discovery. “The GMRT provided the most crucial measurement at low radio frequencies to estimate the speed of the ejected material. This is only the second such highly-luminous transient known and this discovery establishes a new class of transients with extremely powerful central engine,” Chandra said. She along with A. J. Nayana, represented NCRA-TIFR and worked together with Deanne Coppejans and R. Margutti from Northwestern University; Mari-Ela Chock from W.M. Keck Observatory and several others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-radio-telescope-helps-discover-new-class-of-powerful-astronomical-explosions/story-HsJCXqwchBYY42zVi2p1VL.html

However, that work remained incomplete due to the lockdown.The animal exchange programme with the Hyderabad zoo to exchange a Royal Bengal tiger at the Katraj zoo with a white Royal Bengal tiger at Hyderabad zoo had not progressed, he said.The zoo was hoping to touch a revenue of Rs 5.50 crore for the current financial year, but that is unlikely due to drop in footfall and loss of revenue after the Covid-19 pandemic, he said.The zoo has remained closed to the public since March 14. On any normal weekday, the zoo would see 5,000-10,000 visitors while on weekends, the number would rise to 12,000-18,000 visitors, he said.The zoo currently has 448 animals and about 100 staffers who keep the zoo guarded and take care of animals. Jadhav said the staff at the zoo has been coming regularly as they are also part of essential services, and have been provided with gumboots, gloves and masks while looking after animals or even otherwise.Only the staff living in red zone areas are not allowed to come, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/drop-in-footfall-hits-revenue-at-katraj-zoo-development-programmes-halted/story-UuMP4Y8YouQ7soGWlMvuoJ.html

Looking back she says, “I was very fond of singing and would copy all the songs I heard. In Delhi, I would participate in the children’s singing programmes of All India Radio.” Her grand-daughter Mansi adds, “She could not pursue her music and after completing studies, she worked in the Punjab National Bank to augment the family income of the migrant family as she was the eldest of six siblings.” Mansi adds that her grandma had been her inspiration and it was this particular song which had become the grand finale for a prominent play ‘Piya Behrupia’, Atul Kumar’s musical adaptation of Shakespeare’s ‘Twelfth Night’ which was part of the London Cultural Olympics in 2012.Romila, who moved from Kolkata after her husband’s death, chose to live at a senior citizens’ complex in Bhiwadi to be independent as well as close to her children in Delhi. “I am very happy to be in Bhiwadi as I did not want to live in Delhi and they take good care of us here.” Mansi and she share a special bond, “I decided to record some of her songs to preserve the magic of her singing and I had no idea what a warm response she would get from the people!” Romila in turn adds, “Mansi is taking forward my love of music and it gives me joy to hear her sing so well!”An endearing shot before the singing is when grandma chides Mansi that it is important for her to arrange her ‘dupatta’ because the senior woman wants to look ‘nice’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/84-year-grandma-a-lockdown-star-with-soulful-singing-of-punjabi-folk-song/story-q2z0wOiyxQatXd72ubz9wO.html

Spending his childhood in Dubai and then moving to the US to pursue his dream of being part of the National Basketball Association (NBA), Vase has done everything right to be a well-known name in the basketball circuit.Vase is currently the assistant performance coach for the Golden State Warriors and is urging to come back to Pune to spread the knowledge of basketball. “I have heard a lot of stories about Pune, the city has immense talent when it comes to basketball. Now, St Vincent’s School also has an indoor basketball court which is great news for the improvement of the sport. Definitely, I will return to the city where I was born, someday,” Vase said.According to Vase, in other parts of India as well there is a lot of talent but there is a lack of infrastructure for basketball in the country.“Once the infrastructure is in place, it will benefit players,” Vase said who wanted to become a basketball player, but switched to becoming a coach.“I was 17, (in Dubai) when I had a couple of knee injuries, and it made me take this decision. If I cannot play physically, I can still motivate and encourage my team and this brought me into the field of coaching,” Vase said. Vase said the decision to switch to coaching was very challenging. “You need to be self-aware as a player but as a coach, you need to keep track of your team and you need to keep them motivated even when the team loses and it is important to keep players in a healthy state of mind,” Vase said who used to play as a shooting guard and small forward during his playing days.NBA academies adding to popularityThe NBA is conducting many activities across India which is helping the sport reach the masses and attract more players.“In India, cricket is the most popular game and one needs just a bat and ball to play it, stumps could be made up of anything but for basketball, we need proper courts and NBA knows this and that’s why they have opened up academies in India. Once there is an academy in every part of the country, the game will easily grow,” Vase said.Focus on fitnessAccording to Vase, some Indian players reach a height of 7 feet, but if you are 6 feet 5 inches or 6 feet 8 inches, there is always a great demand in the NBA. “I think, soon there will be many Indian players who will be making the cut to the NBA. They just need to focus on fitness along with basketball. I have seen many Indian players, they have skills but fitness is something on which they don’t focus and it keeps them behind,” added Vase.Name: Adi VaseAge: 29Coach: Assistant performance coach, Golden State WarriorsBest players coached: Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors), Kawhi Leonard (Los Angeles Clippers), Brandon Ingram (New Orleans Pelicans), Tim Duncan (San Antonio Spurs), Manu Ginobili (San Antonio Spurs)Favourite player: Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors) - Great leadership skills and competitivenessPast coaching experience: Athletic development quality assurance assistant at San Antonio Spurs, Assistant strength and conditioning coach at Los Angeles Lakers. What NBA players are doing in lockdownIt is an uncertain time, especially for teams who are in the race for the playoffs and championship. Players are unsure whether they will play again, so all stars are working out to stay fit and healthy in case the season starts again and the NBA finishes the playoffs. Stars are also giving back to their community, throwing virtual graduation celebrations for many high school kids since schools are shut down. Additionally, many have taken time to do public service announcements in the fight against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/once-basketball-infrastructure-is-in-place-in-india-players-will-benefit-adi-vase/story-qV6a7xUQAGO6YfmW3nLGeO.html
