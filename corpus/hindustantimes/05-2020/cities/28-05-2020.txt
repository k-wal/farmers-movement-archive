28-05-2020||Mumbai||Three cyclists hit the pedal, collect ₹4 lakh for migrants, cops||Three cyclists have raised over Rs 4 lakh for Covid-19 relief by cycling indoors for 24 to 48 hours. Each of them covered between 500 to 1,300 kilometres and collected donations from the public while live streaming their efforts.“Since it was clear that the responsible thing to do during lockdown was to stay indoors, I realised our responsibility didn’t have to end with that. We could still do more work for society even while we stay indoors,” said 35-year-old Alibaug resident and ultra-distance cyclist Sumit Patil.To cycle indoors, the bicycle is mounted on a turbo trainer, which helps the cyclist cycle maintain their stationary position. Most cyclists use online software that give them routes and the feeling of cycling outdoors, including excess pressure when the virtual route includes uphill roads.On May 20, Patil set up his cycle on the roof of his house and chose to live stream himself cycling to raise funds for migrant labourers. “I found an organisation that has been providing water and energy supplements to all those taking the Mumbai-Agra route and directed all the funds I could raise,” he said. In 24 hours, Patil covered close to 644km and raised Rs 1.8 lakh. “My initiative was to encourage people to contribute Rs 100 for a kilometre I ride, and so I was expecting to raise around Rs 65,000. When I realised that I could raise more than double that amount, I was humbled to know that many people wanted to contribute, just didn’t know how,” said Patil.Software engineer and cycling enthusiast PVR Sasikanth also raised funds for the urban poor. Based in Hyderabad, Sasikanth raised around Rs 70,000 by cycling for 24 hours. “I wanted to help people who I could see needed help, so sought help from other cycling enthusiasts who joined the live stream of my stationary cycling session,” he said. “I covered just over 500km and managed to raise around Rs 70,000 in 24 hours. Whatever I collected, I used to help the poor struggling for food and water in my neighborhood.” Nagpur-based ultra-distance cyclist Amit Samarth turned 40 on May 5. “For my birthday, I decided to cycle for 48 hours at a stretch and raise funds for the state police force,” he said. Samarth has previously completed the Race Across America (4,940 kms) and the Trans-Siberian Extreme (9,100 kms). “I started cycling on May 2 and ended it on May 4, with minimum sleep and bathroom breaks. My family and friends kept my hydrated and kept encouraging me throughout the 48 hours,” said Samarth.At the end of the two days, Samarth had cycled 1,301km and raised over Rs 2.2 lakh. “Since the state police is on the forefront of the Covid-19 fight, I directed Rs 1.51 lakh of the money raised to the state police while the rest was donated to three different NGOs who are running kitchens to feed people. I couldn’t have asked for a better birthday,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/three-cyclists-hit-the-pedal-collect-4-lakh-for-migrants-cops/story-uYlYo1H5lLpHopUKZPF4cO.html

28-05-2020||Mumbai||Farmers can get loans up to 70% of their produce cost||To provide relief to distressed farmers, the state government has launched a mortgage loan scheme against their farm produce. The new scheme allows a farmer to stock his produce at the godown of the Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation (MSWC) and get up to 70% amount of total cost of the produce as a mortgage loan.The corporation will also provide the warehouse to store the stock at half the prices. The farmers can take benefit of the scheme if they are not getting a proper price for their produce or facing any other difficulty in selling their stock.Currently, under the scheme, the loan will be provided by the Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank. State cooperation minister Balasaheb Patil said that the scheme has been formalised keeping in mind the difficulties being faced by the farmers. The scheme allows to safely store their stock until they get a proper price to sell and prepare for the next season. “We are starting this scheme for three months on a pilot basis and based on the response, we might extend it to other banks,” said Patil.The application for the scheme has been made online so that farmers don’t have to go to the bank. A facility has been created through which the application for the mortgage loan can be made through the online system of MSWC, based on the receipt issued against the stock. “The state has also prepared a mobile application through which loan application can be given,” said the cooperation minister.“They will get the loan at an interest rate of 9% only. The state has also put a cap of Rs 5 lakh on the mortgage loan,” he added.Farmers will be free to sell their produce anytime they want. “The only condition is that they have to clear the principal loan amount along with the interest,” said a senior official from cooperation department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/farmers-can-get-loans-up-to-70-of-their-produce-cost/story-V6VNpXyHGaZB7X3dw3rVEO.html
28-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai airport likely to see low footfall till November: Officials||While the Mumbai airport is the only major airport to be restricted to operate 25 departures resulting in poor passenger footfalls, officials expect the pattern of low passenger footfall to continue for the coming six months. A senior airport official said, “We have never seen the airport this empty.”“Looking at the situation we don’t see the airport getting back to its regular footfall before November,” the official added.Airport sources said that the terminal 2 (T2) of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) is operating with lesser staff across their various departments. Fewer retail outlets have been opened for passengers due to restrictions of flight movements at Mumbai airport. The airport witnessed a total of 50 scheduled flights which include 25 departures and 25 arrivals. The airport had operated 47 flights on the first day after restrictions were lifted and 44 flights on the second day. It, however, operated to its maximum limit set by the state government on Wednesday and Thursday. “CSMIA connected to 16 sectors which were operated by five airlines. On Thursday, CSMIA catered to a total of 5,583 passengers which include 4,255 passengers at departures and 1,328 at arrivals,” airport operator Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) said. IndiGo operated 22 flights to and from Mumbai, SpiceJet operated 14 flights, Air India operated four flights, AirAsia India operated four and Vistara operated six flights to and from CSMIA. Unlike the previous three days where Delhi route saw maximum passenger load, the highest passenger load capacity on the fourth day was seen to be on the Bhubaneshwar route departing out of CSMIA. A senior airport official said, “We hope the state government relaxes the restriction of only 50 flights movements from the airport from June 1, Monday.”“ As of now, only five airlines are operating flights and GoAir will be added to the schedule from Monday, leading to reduced flight frequencies thus adding to passenger trouble. However, there has been no communication from the state government on this as of now,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-airport-likely-to-see-low-footfall-till-november-officials/story-Di8j8A393hHsKaaoqt7SUP.html
28-05-2020||Noida||Traders meet the DM, weekly holiday for shops may be changed to Tuesday||Taking cognizance of traders’ complaints about diminished sales, the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration is planning to change the holiday for markets from Sunday to Tuesday.After meeting a delegation of representatives of different market associations on Thursday, district magistrate Suhas LY said traders have demanded a change in the holiday from Sunday to Tuesday. “Their points appeared reasonable to me. I’ll communicate their pleas to the state government and if it is approved, then the mandatory closing and sanitization day for all markets will be Tuesday and not Sunday,” he said.When asked about shifting the curfew timings of 7pm to 7am to a different time slot, Suhas said the curfew timings can’t be shifted in any case as it has been set nationwide, on the orders of the Union home ministry. “Since the maximum permissible limit of people in a market must not be over 50% the normal footfall, we have no option but to allow shops to alternately open through the week,” he said.Sushil Kumar Jain, president of Sector 18 market association, said if the weekly holiday is shifted, it will act as a boon for traders. “It will definitely help traders increase their sales,” he said. The DM also said the ‘illegitimate’ restrictions imposed by several residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) and apartment owners’ associations (AOAs) have come to his notice and he has called a meeting of different RWAs and AOAs on Thursday evening. “The RWAs and AOAs can only act as regulatory agencies, not as enforcement authorities. We will certainly take strict action against RWAs and AOAs that are found interpreting the government orders as per their whims and fancies,” he said. About the restricted movement between Delhi and Noida, Suhas said the interstate border regulation has caused some degree of inconvenience. “But, these decisions are being taken after looking at the epidemiological (medical) data, prevailing situation in the neighbouring places and contact tracing of previous Covid-19 patients. These parameters are being monitored continuously and appropriate decisions will be taken at the state and district level after taking both health and livelihood issues into consideration,” Suhas said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/traders-meet-the-dm-weekly-holiday-for-shops-may-be-changed-to-tuesday/story-LzszaBJRz23kvUAdj9QTCJ.html
28-05-2020||Mumbai||After migrant exodus, state to launch portal for sons of soil||The state government will soon launch a portal of the Industrial Labour Bureau to enable local unemployed youth to register for jobs to fill the gap evolved due to the exodus of migrant labourers. Industrial units, too, can enrol their requirement of labourers in various sectors on the portal.The state government constituted the bureau two weeks ago in the wake of the mass exodus of migrant workers due to the lockdown. It also appealed to local unemployed youth to come forward to fill the vacant posts. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said youth should contribute in rebuilding Maharashtra by taking up the jobs. After four review meetings, industries minister Subhash Desai has directed the departments concerned to launch the portal at the earliest. Desai said the data accumulated from the employment job fairs held over the past two years will be utilised by the bureau.“Maharashtra Information Technology Corporation Limited is developing this portal in association with the industries, labour and skill development department. It is almost ready and is expected to be launched next week. Besides facilitating employers, our skill development department will also impart training to the unemployed if required,” said an official from the industries department.According to the estimates, about 10 lakh migrant workers have gone back to their respective states and it may lead to shortage of workforce in industrial units after the lockdown is lifted. To tide over the shortage, the state government has constituted the bureau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-migrant-exodus-state-to-launch-portal-for-sons-of-soil/story-3tehfWiThEhgXoyDVz3eTI.html
28-05-2020||City||Residents of highrise near Hindon airbase without regular water supply for two days||Residents of Oxy Homez, a high rise near the Hindon airbase, claimed that they were forced to live without water supply and with fluctuating power amid peak summer season since Wednesday.“In some houses there is some supply but in most, the taps have completely run dry. We were sent a message on May 26 that water supply will be closed for cleaning of tanks from 6am to 3pm on May 27. But the supply did not resume till Thursday,” said Mukesh Kumar, a resident of Oxy Homez high rise. The society is home to 5000 people in about 1470 flats.“Since most of the residents are at home due to lockdown, power consumption is more. The households were provided with an average of 3kVA power connections by the developer. The power load now has increased as usage of ACs and other electrical gadgets has increased. This is now proving to be insufficient,” said Vipin Kumar, another resident. “The power goes out whenever the overall usage exceeds the limit. So the entire electricity system needs to be probed by the electricity department.” Hirdesh Aggarwal, the director of Oxy Homez project, said that 2kVA to 5kVA electricity connections were provided to the residents initially.“As residents have now installed more gadgets, the load has gone up. They can always approach the electricity department and increase their electricity load on payment of charges. Some residents have already got the load increased. Regarding the water supply issue, there was cleaning of tanks which was to be done for a day and residents were sent messages. However, there is an issue of air bubble in pipelines for which our plumbers are taking up maintenance,” he said. “The issue was sorted out in 10 out of 13 towers and normal supply will be resumed by Thursday evening.” RK Rana, the chief engineer (distribution) of the Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited said, “We will get an inquiry done into the single point connection taken up by the highrise. A review will be done if there are issues with the connection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-of-highrise-near-hindon-airbase-without-regular-water-supply-for-two-days/story-n1sMrYxv7JoSBfZtlld9CP.html

The alleged incident took place while the woman was out on her morning walk.Several video clips of CCTV footage from the area have emerged, which HT has seen, where the accused can purportedly be seen borrowing a stick from the guard, pacing towards the victim and after sometime running back, while throwing the stick back towards the guard. The victim is seen returning after sometime in a state of shock, and is limping.According to the medical report of the victim, she sustained multiple injuries on her private parts. The victim said that she had also contacted the Chinese Embassy following the incident which provided them with an option of evacuation.“I am under shock. It was an act of violence, and with that man living in the same society, we are scared of our safety. I knew that India was not safe, but never imagined that something like this would happen with me within the society where I live. Also, I did not expect such treatment of a foreign national. The man attacked me from behind and hit with all his strength. Worse, he still roams free,” said the woman, adding that residents of the high rise are divided on their support for her.The apartment owner association (AOA), though, released a statement condemning the incident, on the societies’ internal group. They, however, refused to comment.“We have decided not to comment on the incident. The police are looking after the matter,” said Sombir Singh, secretary, AOA, ATS Green Paradiso.The NCR registered by the police did not mention the name of the accused, and slapped only section 323 of the Indian Penal Code (voluntary hurting) in the report. Calling out the alleged “inaction” by the police, the Peoples for Animal (PFA) met the victim and provided her legal help.“This is not just an act of brutality to an animal feeder but also with a woman. She was badly beaten and even sustained injuries on her private parts. We will not tolerate this, or the inaction by the police,” said Kaveri Rana, president, PFA, Gautam Budh Nagar.“Police did not file an FIR in the cognizable offence and did not investigate the matter. So we are approaching the district court to ensure justice,” said Vishal Gautam, legal counsellor of PFA.The legal team of the PFA has demanded for an FIR with strict penal sections including 354, which is for punishment for criminal assault to a woman.Meanwhile, the police have said that they are now registering an FIR after taking the statement of the victim again.“We had already filed an NCR, and presented the accused in front of the magistrate, after which he was sent to jail and granted bail on the same day. We will now file the FIR with the proper statement of the victim, follow the due process, and also file a chargesheet,” said Sujeet Upadhyay, Station House Officer (SHO), Beta-2 Police station, Greater Noida. Vrinda Shukla, DCP, women’s safety, tweeted, “Noidawasis & animal lovers have been distressed over the reported aggression against a Chinese resident of Greater Noida. A case has been duly registered.”“The police has consistently assured the victim of full support. Initially an NCR under Section 323 IPC was registered as per victim’s application. Upon investigation a case is registered under Sections 354B, 504 & 323 IPC. We are committed to the safety and dignity of all women,” the Noida police department tweeted later in the evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chinese-national-assaulted-in-greater-noida-highrise-over-feeding-stray-dog-cops-yet-to-register-fir/story-l2pkImBiQeJCfoa1peYgNI.html

Around 8.15am, a portion of the ceiling in the master bedroom of the house of a Sidharth Jaiswal had collapsed, injuring a seven-year-old boy on the head.Following the incident, the family had filed a complaint with the Bisrakh police and a case had been registered against four persons from the maintenance, the management and the developer under sections 288, 337 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code.“After the mishap, a team had rushed to the spot to take cognizance of the situation and the child had been taken for treatment. A case was registered and three people were arrested today. Residents were clearly upset about the quality of construction there,” Harish Chandra, the deputy commissioner of police, zone 3, said.The suspects were identified as Madhusudhan Kumar (the project manager), Aditya Agarwal (general manager, construction) and Harivansh Rai (the estate manager of the society). A fourth person (from the developer’s company) was also booked but has not been arrested yet. They were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.The police suspected that the incident might lead to opposition from the residents, and as a precaution booked the suspects under Section 151 of the CrPC to prevent public disorder.While the family did not want to comment on the situation, residents claimed that the response from the builder has been very lax.“No official visited the spot yesterday. A few people came over today and claimed to cover the cost of everything. But the problem is that there are several more at-risk spots in the society. Such incidents have taken place in other projects of the developer as well. We want them to take some responsibility before anything more serious happens,” a resident of the society said, requesting anonymity.While the builder, had on Wednesday, said that they sent a show-cause notice to the contractor for the repairs, they refused to comment following the arrests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-arrested-after-ceiling-collapses-in-greater-noida-west-high-rise/story-lIEVI4D6HTmhXAoqDnMKvL.html
28-05-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown saved lives of 8K to 32K people: Report||Analysis based on INDSCI-SIM, the first India-specific epidemiological model developed by the Indian Scientists’ Response to Covid-19 (ISRC), estimates that approximately 8,000 to 32,000 Indians averted death between April 3 and May 15 because of a combination of factors that include lockdown restrictions, increased testing, quarantine and physical distancing.ISRC is a group of more than 500 Indian scientists, engineers, doctors, technologists and public health researchers. It aims to provide accurate, science-based resources pertaining to the pandemic while also dispelling misinformation.A Niti Aayog report dated May 22 estimated that between 37,000 to 2.10 lakh Indians had evaded being infected by Covid-19. ISRC’s analysis arrived at a lower figure — between 8,000 to 32,000 — for this group. “Our mathematical model shows fewer Indians have been saved as compared to claims made in other reports, which is tough to crosscheck since we, unfortunately, have no idea of the technique used to arrive at those numbers. Ours is a more conservative estimate, and our method is documented,” said professor Bhalchandra Pujari of Savitribai Phule Pune University, who was part of the team that developed the INDSCI-SIM model.Scientists also said a large number of individuals infected with the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, have escaped detection. Dividing the population into six age groups with different infection and fatality rates, the model shows that those above 60 years of age form the major chunk of hospitalisations for and death from Covid-19. However, most Covid-positive cases are among people between 0 and 40 years of age, who are less likely to die of the infection.“In order to match the death timeline, our model indicates much higher infections than reported. This is however understandable, given most people are either asymptomatic or suffer from mild infections along with cases of death, all of which can go undetected,” said Pujari.Epidemiologist Dr Giridhar Babu, who is not involved with ISRC, said globally, new evidence suggests only clusters are important in the long run since on an average, 10% of a population have caused 80% of infections. “We need to prevent clusters from being formed. Gathering of more than two people should be banned as well as weddings, marathons, work space arrangements, or any large gatherings for the next three to four months. That will either lead to postponing or even flattening the curve. If we enforce cluster prevention strictly along with using masks and maintaining physical distance, we can continue with whatever gains we made,” said Babu.The ISRC team said a spike in the number of new Covid-positive cases is expected around August if current lockdown strategies are maintained, which would help keep the infection rate, or R0 (referring to the number of people infected by one Covid-positive individual), low. However, if there is a return to pre-lockdown conditions, a sharp spike is expected around mid-July.However, individual states and cities should work out their respective estimation to better plan measures to contain the epidemic.“The point of postponing the peak was to prepare the health infrastructure, which has been done. So health systems will be able cater to what is likely to be expected unless it goes beyond it,” said Babu. “States will peak at different times. Preventing clusters is the key, and how it will be done will define a state’s success.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-saved-lives-of-8k-to-32k-people-report/story-HFceo2L77kUa6zMCvl7QHO.html
28-05-2020||Mumbai||‘Bodies of Parsis who die of Covid-19 in Mumbai to be cremated’||Parsi community leaders on Thursday announced that the bodies of those community members who die of Covid-19 will be cremated, owing to the threat of transmission of the virus. The community traditionally follows the dakhma system or confines bodies to the Tower of Silence, a raised structure for dead bodies to be exposed to sun and carrion birds, usually vultures.The development comes around a month after the municipal corporation issued guidelines, allowing the burial of Covid-19 victims within city limits, provided the ground is large enough to ensure that there is no threat of transmission to the residents of the area.“For last rites to be held at Doongerwadi [Tower of Silence], we need permission from BMC [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation]. However, in the case of Covid 19 deaths, no such permission has been provided, and it is BMC who is performing the cremation,” said Viraf Mehta, trustee of Bombay Parsi Punchayet (BPP), caretaker of Parsi properties in the city and the community’s largest representative body.A circular issued by BPP stated that for the last rites to be performed at Doongerwadi, there are several rituals that need to be performed, which would mean opening the bag in which bodies of Covid-19 patients are sealed.“On one hand, BMC tells the [Bombay] high court that there is no harm in touching the bodies of those who pass away of Covid-19, while on the other, one cannot open the bags in which the bodies are kept or touch the bodies, without which we cannot really perform the rituals. Also, there is a risk of transmission to pall bearers,” Mehta said. He added that though there are no official numbers to ascertain the Covid-19 deaths in the family, around 10-15 community members would have died of the virus.The Bombay high court had last week observed that there was no scientific data to support the claim that Covid-19 can spread through dead bodies.BPP, however, clarified that for those who die a natural death, traditional dakhma system is being followed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bodies-of-parsis-who-die-of-covid-19-in-mumbai-to-be-cremated/story-whRC1um7WaGB9fNz1U3GLN.html

On May 19, this year, he had a scuffle with another prisoner, named Allauddin, during which both of them fell from the porch on the solid floor of the drain channel below. While Aarif had sustained a head fracture, the other prisoner had minor injuries. “He was injured and was first taken to GIMS for treatment, from where he was referred to the district hospital. He was later referred to a higher centre in Delhi for treatment from where he was discharged on May 26 and transferred back here,” said Vipin Mishra, jail superintendent.However, on Wednesday his condition deteriorated and he was again rushed to the district hospital around 2.30pm. The hospital declared him dead on arrival. Officials said that the cause of his death based on the autopsy was Hyperpyrexia (high fever). They said that he was not corona positive and his body was handed over to his family, following an autopsy. The family was informed by the local police about the incident. Mishra further said that a complaint will be filed with the police soon.“A case will be registered as soon as either the jail authorities or the family file a complaint,” said Rajesh Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 3.Senior police officials will nominate a magistrate to conduct an inquest while the district court will nominate a judicial magistrate for conducting a judicial enquiry, read a statement from the jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/prisoner-in-luksar-jail-dies-after-fight-with-another-inmate/story-5EpxfCt5KhkxC3AmaZ6EDJ.html

His report today showed him positive for the coronavirus but he is already well on the road to recovery,” a senior police officer said.To avoid panic within the ranks, officers refused to give the number of personnel who have been quarantined so far.However, sources from the health department said 19 other personnel from the same station have been quarantined.“The contact tracing team is working on identifying all people who may have come in contact with the infected persons,” an official from the health department said.After the constable from the traffic department had tested positive, Gautam Budh Nagar traffic department had temporarily closed the fine counter on the premises.“The constable is a resident of Delhi and when he had complained of symptoms, he was asked to quarantine himself. Later, when he tested positive, three others from the office were quarantined, two of whom got their reports which were negative for the virus. The third one is awaited.

28-05-2020||City||As migrants leave Mumbai, major infrastructure projects in city stuck||Lakhs of migrant workers leaving the city has badly hit ongoing infrastructure projects worth crores.Officials of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which had more than 11,000 labourers at various project sites, said more than 50% have left. RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said, “We are yet to assess the impact, but migrant workforce leaving the city has affected projects.”Earlier, MMRDA had also said that Metro-2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-7 (Dahisar E-Andheri E), which were to be commissioned in December 2020, will be delayed by three months owing to the delays caused by the lockdown.Apart from the Metro corridors, MMRDA is also constructing the decades-old 22km sea-bridge Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) connecting Mumbai and Navi Mumbai and several bridges in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.An official said, “Almost all projects of MMRDA are facing problems owing to lack of labour force. There is a sort of anxiety among labourers, making them leave the city despite being provided with food and shelter at work sites.”MMRDA has also started works on phase-2 of the makeshift Covid-19 hospital at the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) grounds. The new facility will also have 1,000 beds, of which 100 beds will serve as the intensive care unit (ICU), while the rest will have both, oxygen and non-oxygen facilities, officials said. The work is expected to be completed in another 15-20 days.AV Shenoy from Mumbai Mobility Forum said, “Infrastructure is heavily dependent on labour force and the problem of migrant workers is likely to continue till the end of monsoon. We are likely to lose out on almost a year’s work in the bargain.” Meanwhile, the Central, Western, Konkan and South Central railways operated nearly 30 Shramik special trains from Maharashtra on Thursday. The trains were operated to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-migrants-leave-mumbai-major-infrastructure-projects-in-city-stuck/story-Y1R2FHQk1ZTT8WCqieBpFO.html
28-05-2020||City||Traffic between Ghaziabad and Delhi doubles despite restrictions||Ghaziabad: Though traffic snarls at UP-Gate, at which the Ghaziabad-Delhi border falls, have eased in the past two days due to easing of restrictions, the flow of vehicles plying between Delhi and Ghaziabad has doubled. The nationwide lockdown, imposed from March 25 to curb the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, had brought vehicular movement to a halt. Later, as officials put curbs on movement between Ghaziabad and Delhi, drivers and passengers were made to undergo checks before they could pass through. In a decision taken earlier on April 20, the district magistrate under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act had prohibited any travel between Ghaziabad and Delhi except for those involved in essential services or having valid passes. The officials said that the latest direction of restriction on the border was under lockdown 4.0 guidelines issued by the Uttar Pradesh government on May 18.Under the May 18 directions of chief secretary RK Tiwari, commuters from Delhi, other than those from hot spot areas, were allowed to travel to NCR areas of Noida and Ghaziabad and the district administration was asked to issue detailed directions in this regard.Checking process of vehicles was ending up in traffic snarls at the border. However, after a May 26 order, which allowed for vehicles with passes to move, the jams have eased as cops have resorted to only random checks instead of checking every single vehicle passing through, said commuters.According to police officials, there is movement of roughly about 10,000 vehicles everyday at the border, which is more than double the number of vehicles, about 4,000, passing through the area when the earlier restrictions were imposed.“The traffic situation has eased and there are no long jams which were witnessed upto May 26. Back then, the police were checking each and every vehicle, which resulted in snarls. Now, there is random checking of vehicles which has resulted in lesser stoppage of vehicles at the border. The barricades are, however, still there,” said Kuldeep Saxena, an Indirapuram resident who works with the electricity department in Delhi.“Presently, there is a waiting time of about 5 to 10 minutes during the morning and evening rush hours, which is manageable,” he added.“At present, there are about 10,000 vehicles which are estimated to be passing through the UP-Gate border to Delhi. There is a spike in the number of vehicles as markets and offices in Delhi have opened up. Now, people know that they have to get passes issued for travelling to Delhi. There are checks at four points at the border during peak hours while checking at only two points is taken up during afternoon hours as there is very less traffic,” said Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city).“The increase in the number of vehicles could also be due to the fact that the district magistrate’s order had given exemption to certain categories of commuters who can pass through on the basis of their identification cards,” he added.The vehicles involved in essential supplies are allowed to move without any restrictions.According to official records of the Ghaziabad administration, at least 16,102 passes were issued in April up to May 26 to those who wished to travel to any district in the state of Uttar Pradesh.“About 4,000 manual passes have been issued so far for people who have to go outside UP jurisdiction. About 80% of these are those who applied to travel to Delhi. During the initial days of the lockdown, we received about 800-900 applications daily for travel and only about 5-10% were given approval,” said MS Garbyal, additional district magistrate and the nodal officer for passes.“Since there have been more relaxations under lockdown 4.0, we have about 900-1,000 applications coming in and about 60% of these are approved. So, the number of valid commuters from Ghaziabad has also increased,” said MS Garbyal, additional district magistrate and the nodal officer for passes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/traffic-between-ghaziabad-and-delhi-doubles-despite-restrictions/story-ZWiLI1jBOf8CT5TAZxgJaI.html

28-05-2020||City||HC relief to YEIDA allottees on increased compensation||In a major relief to the allottees of Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) land in Gautam Buddh Nagar district, the Allahabad High Court on Thursday said neither the state government nor the development authorities could recover the increased compensation given to farmers whose land was acquired from the allottees without any prior agreement. Ruling that any extra demand made by Yeida from the allottees was illegal, the court quashed all such demand orders.With this, the bench comprising Justices Pankaj Mithal and VC Dixit allowed a bunch of petitions filed by Shakuntla Educational and Welfare Society and various other builders and Trusts.On August 29, 2014, the state government had passed an order mentioning that due to the farmers’ stir and legal complications, an out of court settlement with the farmers offering them 64.7% more compensation for their acquired land was necessary provided they withdrew their petitions challenging the acquisition proceedings. “The government directed for the payment of 64.7% additional amount to the farmers and to recover it from the allottees of the land,” said that order.However, the petitioners’ contention was that the state government was recovering increased compensation from the allottees though it never modified terms and conditions of the contract and in the absence of the same the state government had no right to recover any excess compensation from the petitioners.“Any rights, on the basis of a concluded or final contract or lease, which have been crystallised in favour of any party cannot be taken away by framing a policy on some later date. A policy so framed would be prospective in nature and cannot affect the contracts already finalised. Any such policy which is unilaterally framed disturbing the rights which have accrued to a party would clearly be violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution,” contented the petitioners.Yeida representatives could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-relief-to-yeida-allottees-on-increased-compensation/story-MT9fP7vIHKXA4IK435hT4M.html

They alleged that as compared to the ₹500 or ₹600 charge for every quintal of wood earlier, residents need to pay at least ₹900 now for every quintal of wood. The councillors said they have raised the matter with the municipal commissioners and urged him to take action in this regard even as caretaker at the Hindon cremation ground said that the shortage of wood has forced the price to shoot up.“Families of the deceased need to pay at least ₹900 per quintal nowadays for wood that would otherwise around ₹500 per quintal if bought from the local markets and about ₹600 per quintal from markets in Hapur. The costs would be conclusive of transportation charges and cess etc, but now families are being overcharged now. This is happening amid the lockdown when people are already facing all kinds of troubles, we have asked municipal commissioner to take action in this regard,” said Himanshu Mittal, councillor from Kavi Nagar.“The rates now are too high and even ₹100 is charged extra for carrying the wood from the stockpile to the funeral platform. This rampant overcharging is not acceptable and must stop,” he added.According to Acharya Manish Pandit, caretaker at the Hindon cremation ground, last rites for nearly 10 to 15 bodies is performed at the premises daily and each funeral requires three to four quintals of wood.“Currently, we have to charge about ₹900 per quintal for wood, and it is because of non-availability of wood in local markets. We have to procure wood from areas like Kithor in Meerut and Gulaothi in Bulandshahr. The cost has also increased on account of transportation charges and also the increased wages we pay to our workers,” Pandit said.“Just when the lockdown started we were charging about ₹750 per quintal of wood. Until May 13, we had an adequate quantity of wood that was supplied from Meerut and Bulandshahr and after adding all charges, which increased during the lockdown, families had to pay ₹800 for every quintal of wood. Since the availability of wood has gone down, we had to increase the rate of wood to ₹ 900 per quintal. We are providing wood free of cost for unidentified bodies, and also not charging economically backward people anything,” he added.Municipal commissioner Dinesh Chandra said Pandit has been running the Hindon cremation ground for the past 10 years on a contract basis. “He has been managing the affairs of the cremation ground for the last 10 years, and we will review his contract. I have sought a report over the complaints I received from the councillors about residents being overcharged,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-being-overcharged-for-wood-at-hindon-cremation-ground-allege-councillors/story-ZAzbPmUB8WBnzHYvkVQO8I.html
28-05-2020||Noida||Rules confusion: It took admin two days to seal a tower after case is detected||The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration took two days to seal a residential tower, from where a Covid-19 case was reported on May 25. Residents questioned why the administration took two days to act and said it was the patient’s family who informed neighbours about the positive case. The positive patient is a resident of Amrapali Silicon City in Sector 76, a housing society that has 21 residential towers and at least 2,000 families living in them. “On May 25, we got to know that one resident, who works with a private company, had tested positive for Covid-19 and was admitted to a government hospital in the district. The family of the patient shared the news with us. But we were taken aback that the administration had not promptly sealed the tower or put up a notice informing people about the positive case. In earlier cases, the administration was sealing the premises right after a person was found positive,” Amita Singh, a resident of Silicon City, said.Residents said in two days, many who were not aware of the Covid-19 case, kept using the common space in the society.“Sealing a building promptly helps in preventing the spread of the infection. But if it is delayed, then it defeats the purpose,” Vimal Kumar, another resident, said.Silicon City Social Welfare Association (SCSWA) said that they have sanitized the common spaces such as lifts, and gallery.“The administration has deployed a police contingent and other workers to ensure protocols are followed at the tower. The staff deployed at the tower informed us that they sealed the tower as and when they got the orders,” Naveen Mishra, president, SCSWA, said.Noida city magistrate Uma Shankar Singh said it takes time to seal a building. “There was a discussion on whether we should seal just the tower or the entire society. Later, it was decided that only the tower will be sealed and arriving at that decision took time,” Singh said.District magistrate Suhas LY said, “According to the new containment zone provisions, we only seal the tower if it is a lone case, and an area in a 500m radius if there are more than one case. So it takes time to start the sealing process,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/rules-confusion-it-took-admin-two-days-to-seal-a-tower-after-case-is-detected/story-bbsZRxJc6sy8POLVo1dUiL.html

28-05-2020||Chandigarh||Locust threat: Bhiwani, Dadri put on alert||The district administrations of Bhiwani and Dadri on Thursday alerted farmers after locust swarms attacked crops in neighbouring Rajasthan, said officials.Bhiwani deputy commissioner (DC) Ajay Kumar said the agricultural department has formed village-level WhatsApp groups wherein farmers are being given information and issued directions to flag any sighting of the insect. “Locust swarms have reached Sardarshahar in Rajasthan and may enter Bhiwani through Churu and Pilani areas. We are in regular touch with Rajasthan agricultural officials,” he added. Bhiwani deputy director, agriculture, Pratap Singh Sabhrawal, said farmers have been advised to use pesticides such as chlorpyrifos, deltamethrin, diflubenzuron and cyhalothrin to protect their crops, vegetables and trees. “Nearly 200 tractor-mounted sprayers have been arranged in the areas adjoining Rajasthan borders in the district. We have also advised the people to make loud noise by beating drums, thalis, sound producing instruments and tin boxes to drive away the locusts. Moreover, fire officials have also been put on high alert to control the situation. Patwaris and village secretaries have been directed to visit villages and spread information about the locust attack,” he added.Similarly, Dadri administration has also ensured that farmers in the district are well aware of the impending threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/locust-threat-bhiwani-dadri-put-on-alert/story-5XV7bJ7PnxiDZ9UiTgM6YO.html
28-05-2020||Chandigarh||Doctors decry hike in MBBS fee||The almost 80% fee hike announced for MBBS courses in government medical colleges from the current academic session by the Punjab government has come in for criticism from all quarters.Calling for protests, some doctors called it an attack on youngsters wanting to become doctors, questioning the timing, especially when MBBS students were doing emergency duties in Covid-19 wards in hospitals. “This policy is an attack on future medicos, the fee hike came when the MBBS students are doing their duties in emergency wards and other departments of the hospitals where Covid-19 patients are being treated,” said Dr Jaspinder Partap Singh, president, Resident Doctors’ Association, Government Medical College, Amritsar.“It’s a wrong step as it will put extreme financial burden on the students,” said Dr SS Gill, former vice-chancellor, Baba Farid University of Health Sciences. Students from financially disadvantaged families would be discouraged. Non-meritorious students from rich families will get admissions instead of those who are meritorious, which could impact quality, he said.GOVT SHOULD NOT ‘LOOK FOR PROFITS’ Adding that there were medical students in colleges from rural areas and poor families, he said: “There is a huge shortage of doctors in rural areas in the state. The government should provide medical education to meritorious students for a low fee so we can produce good doctors. This is not the sector where the government should look for profits.”Dr Birgurman Singh, studying in Government Medical College, Patiala, said, “Even at Rs 4.4 lakh, the MBBS fee in Punjab government colleges was one of the highest in the country. Also, the MBBS students of Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, pay around Rs 1.21 lakh as fee to the government over five years, which is comparatively lower than that of Punjab medical colleges.”INCREASE IN STIPEND ‘OF NO USE’ On the government’s decision to increase the stipend of undergraduate medical and dental students from Rs 9,000 per month to Rs 15,000 per month, Dr Birgurman Singh said, “this hike will serve no purpose now.”Gurbachan Singh, father of an MBBS aspirant, said the fee hike was “shocking”, especially during the coronavirus outbreak. Now only the wealthy can pursue medical education, said Narinder Pal Singh, the father of another MBBS aspirant in Jalandhar. At present, Punjab has 1,225 MBBS seats in eight medical institutions across the state, 625 seats in five private institutions and 600 seats in three government medical colleges (GMCs).The state will also offer 250 additional MBBS seats from this academic session as Gian Sagar Medical College and Government Medical College in Mohali district will start classes.The Punjab cabinet increased the MBBS fee in government and private medical colleges of the state on Wednesday. The fee for the full five-year course in government-run medical colleges from this session will be Rs 7.8 lakh from Rs 4.4 lakh previously (an increase of around 80%).In private medical colleges, the fee for government quota seats has been hiked from Rs 13.4 lakh to Rs 18 lakh (35% increase) for the course. For management quota, the fee is now Rs 47 lakh instead of Rs 40.3 lakh (around 17% increase).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/doctors-decry-hike-in-mbbs-fee/story-SGJZVcfxPDQfSQNgfb3MkL.html

Amid widespread outrage at these cases, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had said, “I have directed @DGPPunjabPolice to post the few policemen who were unreasonable with the people to police lines. They are overshadowing the good work being done by most. I will not tolerate these excesses.” Bali was shifted a day after this statement. SSP Navjot Singh Mahal could not be reached for comments, but SP (organised crime and narcotics) Ravinder Pal Singh Sandhu confirmed the reappointment. Local MLA and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Jalandhar rural president Gurpartap Wadala said, “The Punjab Police contributed during the pandemic, but there were instances of brutality too, like in the case of the SHO. He deserved punishment after inquiry, but has been reappointed on political considerations,” said MLA and SAD Jalandhar rural president.Another senior police officer said, on condition of anonymity, “On social media, locals are mocking at this decision of the local police. The opposition has also alleged political interference in reappointing the officer at the same station.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/shunted-out-for-thrashing-curfew-violators-kartarpur-sho-brought-back/story-AfCLmbLEb0nrCtbtxAxANM.html

They were on a routine patrol at Parsik area in Kalwa when a group of around 15 people gathered and started pelting stones at them. “The locals started pelting stones and bricks after the officers enquired about the illegal encroachments,” said a forest official from Thane.The three injured employees suffered minor injuries.“The forest officers from Kalwa and Shahabaj were patrolling with forest security guards and workers at Parsik hill near Kalwa when the incident took place. Parsik hill is surrounded by illegal encroachments so regular patrolling is carried out by forest officers. We suspect that the residents staying in these hutments pelted stones and fled,” said a senior official from Thane forest department. The police have registered a case against unknown miscreants. “The case has been registered against the unknown accused under Sections 332 and 353 of Indian Penal Code.

28-05-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana wants to open schools, seeks Union govt’s approval||Haryana government has decided to seek permission from the central government to open schools and start the new academic session with precautions crucial to ensure social distancing and combat the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to education minister Kanwar Pal.On Wednesday, top brass of the Haryana education department held a meeting to chalk out possible plans required to open the schools. But the state government cannot open them without the Centre’s permission. The new academic session generally starts from April 1 every year, but due to the nationwide lockdown, the process could not kick-off this time.Haryana has 8,686 government-run primary, 2,423 middle and 1,154 high schools in its 22 districts.“We are willing to open the government as well as private schools with all the safeguards in place,” education minister Kanwar Pal said.“But, we cannot open the schools until Union government gives its nod. We are in the process of sending a formal request to the Centre, seeking permission to start the academic session,” he added.The education minister said among various ideas discussed in the Wednesday’s meeting was keeping the class strength to 15 students in order to maintain social distance. “We are putting our heads together to fine-tune our plan about the steps to be taken as and when we open the schools. We want to put in place a comprehensive plan keeping in view the safety of students and the teaching staff,” the minister said.Kanwar Pal said he was in favour of allowing the teachers to join duty as a part of the strategy to exit the lockdown. He said even the private schools wanted their teaching staff to resume duty and focus on e-learning.“We cannot take these steps on our own. Yes, I am in favour of asking teachers to join their duty and explore possibilities to help students,” he said.How’s state govt helping students during lockdownWith the ongoing lockdown resulting in academic loss of the students, Haryana government is teaching government schoolchildren of Class 1 to Class 12 across the state through various e-learning platforms.The education department and the State Council of Education Research and Training (SCERT) have launched ‘Ghar Se Padhao Abhiyan’, an e-learning campaign to connect parents and students with over 60,000 teachers through WhatsApp, SMS and phone calls across the state to start academic activities. While math and Hindi lessons are being taught to primary school students, the focus is on science and math in middle and high school.Already, the government has directed the principal/head of a government school, besides a clerk, a computer operator and a peon/gardener to return to duty. The state government had also allowed the private schools of Haryana to open their administrative offices.The Haryana government has also given a onetime amount of ₹2,500 to ₹4,000 to all schools for purchasing soaps, sanitisers, masks and toilet cleaners among other items.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-wants-to-open-schools-seeks-union-govt-s-approval/story-feJc9DgilQxCv9irAYG2LP.html
28-05-2020||Mumbai||Pawar seeks PM Modi’s intervention for revival of real estate sector||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has expressed concerns over the current situation of the real estate sector and has sought the intervention of Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi. In a recent letter to the PM, Pawar requested Modi to consider the demands made by the sector for its revival.“Amidst the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic and consequent nationwide lockdown, the real estate sector is in complete breakdown. Massive outflux of labourers, halted work and sales for almost three months, stagnant consumer demand, and impaired economic activities have taken a toll on this industry which contributes substantially to the national gross domestic product (GDP),” stated the letter written on May 27, which Pawar shared on Twitter.Pawar said that the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of Indian (CREDAI), in an open letter on May 24, had made recommendations such as one-time restructuring, additional institutional funding, waiver of penal interest, policy innovations to trigger consumer demand, controlling cartelisation of raw material, changing criterion of affordability for GST applicability and operationalisation of SWAMIH (Special Window for Completion of Construction of Affordable and Mid-Income Housing) fund.“The detailed presentation is self-explanatory. I shall be grateful if you personally look into the matter and initiate necessary measures for revival of one of the most important sectors of the economy,” the NCP chief wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pawar-seeks-pm-modi-s-intervention-for-revival-of-real-estate-sector/story-dWHGG0GCinFdrS4m9XOPoJ.html
28-05-2020||Ranchi||Jharkhand: In a first, migrant workers land home on chartered flight||Shankar Mandal, a migrant labourer working as tiles fitter in Mumbai, was nervous Thursday morning as he boarded a flight for the first time.Mandal, a resident of Hazraribag road in Jharkhand, boarded the flight along with his family and 10 other relatives from Mumbai for Ranchi. The special chartered flight of Air Asia, carrying 174 migrant workers, landed at Ranchi airport around 8.20 am Thursday.Mandal said, “I never thought I would travel by air ever. I thank people who arranged this for us.” His wife Rita Devi said, “I was scared when the flight started taking off and when it landed. It was a unique experience, a dream come true.”This was the first flight that carried migrant workers to Jharkhand, which has seen more than 3.5 lakh migrant workers arriving by special trains, buses and private vehicles since May 1.Most of the migrants said they had started suffering after a month of lockdown, as they had no money to survive. Aslam Ansari, resident of Nawada in Jharkhand’s Giridih district, who came from Mumbai with four children and his wife, said, “I worked as tailor there. But I was jobless since March 22. One month into the lockdown, we could not even afford to buy food. We planned on returning but had no option to come. We even thought to return on foot. Later, one of my friends said a flight for migrant workers is leaving for Jharkhand after which I filled a form for the same and got a call for the journey.”The return of migrants on a flight was possible by collective effort of a group of alumni of National Law School, Bengaluru, who raised funds for the journey. The six alumni were Suhaan Mukerji, Priyanka Roy, Arkaja Singh, Shyel Trehan, Pria Sharma and Shuva Mandal.Mukerji, a Delhi-based lawyer, said, “Initially, we were trying to arrange buses for the migrant workers. However, on comparison, we found the total cost of flight, about 11 lakh, was not much higher than the bus. So, we decided to send them by flight and started raising funds.”Asked why they chose to send migrants from Jharkhand, Mukerji said, “We came to know that 45 people from Jharkhand were stuck in Mumbai and booked 45 seats in a regular flight. Unfortunately, the flight got cancelled. We then decided to get permission for a special relief flight to overcome the restriction scheduled flights.”“We had sought support from the Jharkhand government for the migrants after their landing in Ranchi. Chief minister Hemant Soren told me he would monitor the arrangements. The state government arranged buses for the workers to reach their native places,” he said.Soren later said the gesture strengthened the spirit of humanity. “Today, 174 migrant labourers returned home safely due to the untiring efforts of the alumni of National Law School, Bangalore, and officials of the government of Jharkhand and Maharashtra. The chief minister has thanked the Alumni Network of National Law School, Bangalore (ANNLSB) for this noble and unique work,” a statement from the CM office said.As thousands of migrant workers are stuck in different parts of the country and are returning home on special trains, the state government had, earlier this month, twice written to the Centre seeking permission to operate special charter flights to bring back hundreds of workers from the state stuck in Andaman & Nicobar Islands, North East states and in Ladakh region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jharkhand-in-a-first-migrant-workers-land-home-on-chartered-flight/story-fLPvpncbw6tSVaUAlFQQ2N.html

The incident had happened on Monday“This warrants intervention by us in exercise of our jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,” said the bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar. Describing the incident as “rather shocking and unfortunate”, the bench requested advocate Ashish Giri to assist the court as amicus curiae. The bench also asked additional advocate genera SD Yadav to ascertain from the nominated standing counsel for the state of Bihar in the Supreme Court, as to whether the apex court has taken cognizance of this particular incident or not. It posted the matter for 2.15 pm Thursday.In the afternoon session, Yadav said that no information could be ascertained from the standing counsel in the apex court or the solicitor general of India. He, however, told the court that deceased was mentally unstable and had died a natural death during the course of her journey from Surat (Gujarat) and it was reported to Railway authorities by her sister and brother-in-law Md Wazir. “The deceased, who had been deserted by her husband, had only one child,” he said.Yadav said that after recording Wazir’s statement, the woman’s body was allowed to be taken home. “No post- mortem examination was conducted and no FIR was registered. The district administration provided an ambulance up to the place of destination. The orphaned child is in safe custody and guardianship of the sister of the deceased,” he said, adding that his statements were based on the instructions so received and the recorded statement of Md Wazir.Awaiting instructions from the standing counsel in the Supreme Court, the bench fixed June 3 as the next date of hearing. “Let complete facts be made known to the Court, on the personal affidavit of the concerned principal secretaries, before the next date,” it said.Earlier, the court asked several questions, viz. whether the postmortem examination of the body was conducted? If yes, what was the cause of death? Did the woman actually die of hunger? Was she travelling alone with her sibling? If not, who all were her companions? Who is now taking care of the children/sibling(s), who unfortunately lost their mother?It issued notices to the union of India through the principal secretary, disaster management, New Delhi, the state of Bihar through its chief secretary, the departments of health & family welfare, disaster management, home, social justice through their principal secretaries, the Indian Railways and the IG (Police).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/an-ill-fated-journey-video-of-toddler-with-dead-mother-moves-patna-hc/story-9O5BafI5pgn7Xqzn76GnZO.html
28-05-2020||Gurugram||Two private hospitals issued notice for refusing Covid-19 patient treatment||The district administration on Thursday issued a show-cause notice to two private hospitals in the city for allegedly denying treatment to Covid-19 patients.The district administration, on May 25, issued an order making it mandatory for all private hospitals and nursing homes to treat Covid-19 patients who require critical health services. None of the private hospitals in the city can refuse admission to a Covid-19 patient who is already undergoing treatment for other health issues. Instances have been reported where patients have been denied treatment after they have tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19). The show cause notice issued by deputy commissioner Amit Khatri to the two private hospitals, namely Park Hospital and Paras Hospital, stated that both the hospitals had not complied with the order.A rapid response team member, who is aware of the matter, said, “One hospital allegedly asked a man to leave in the middle of the night after he was tested Covid-19 positive almost two days back. The other hospital allegedly refused to admit a patient. The patient who was asked to leave in the middle of the night reached out to us and the district administration.”An official statement issued by Paras Hospital said, “We are following all the ICMR guidelines regarding hospital admissions and we haven’t refused any cases till now which requires medical attention.”“We have also formed a multidisciplinary committee comprising doctors and staff from all specialties to guide with standard operating processes to evaluate coronavirus in suspected patients. We take the biggest health threat, the coronavirus pandemic, very seriously. Our doctors are providing round-the-clock telephonic, online and face-to-face consultations to the patients following all safety protocols,” it said.An official of Park Hospital, who preferred anonymity, said, “We have not received any notice from the district administration. We might get it tomorrow (Friday). But none of the Covid-19 patients have been denied treatment in our hospital. At least five Covid-19 positive patients are currently admitted while three or four suspected cases are also being treated. The hospital has a 12-bed isolation ward along with five ventilators. We will respond accordingly, once we receive the notice,”The administration in its order has given the hospitals time till Friday to explain their stand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-private-hospitals-issued-notice-for-refusing-covid-19-patient-treatment/story-8v5a6LGzKGVGIW80NKqyTP.html
28-05-2020||Mumbai||Resume bus services before starting trains, say experts||Citizen group Mumbai Mobility Forum (MMF) has submitted suggestions to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner Iqbal Chahal, of how public transport may be opened up in the city once lockdown restrictions are eased.One of MMF’s suggestions is to increase bus services while local trains remain inoperative. Transport expert and convenor of MMF Ashok Datar said, “As more buses are introduced, we will also learn methods of social distancing in public transport. That can later be incorporated in local trains.”In its letter to BMC, MMF wrote, “We can mobilise 6,000 idle school buses as Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) has only 3,000 buses. School buses are idle and can be used during peak hours at lower cost. Operation of bus lanes on western express highway and eastern express highway for a few months will reduce traffic load on roads, increase the speed, and will work well for working class and low-income citizenry.”MMF has suggested BMC raise fines from Rs 200 to Rs 500 under the Motor Vehicle Act. Higher fines would discourage people from taking out private vehicles, said MMF.The gap between the requirement and supply of on-street parking lots was also highlighted by MMF. “Today, on-street parking lots are under 80. We need at least 600 to make an impact on driving and parking behaviour. … Electronic payment and mobile application to locate idle parking spaces can be introduced,’’ it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/resume-bus-services-before-starting-trains-say-experts/story-HTpjrhIWdGB6Aqsypxf7xL.html

28-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi cites “element of privilege” for 70% tax on liquor||The Delhi government has informed the Delhi high court that trade or consumption of liquor is not a fundamental right and that the state is empowered to regulate the sale of liquor or impose a 70% special corona fee on the maximum retail price (MRP) since there is an “element of privilege” attached to it. The Delhi government also told the court that it had collected a total of ₹227.44 crore (inclusive of ₹127 crore from the special corona fee) as excise revenue between May 4 and May 25. It pointed out that despite the corona fee, its excise revenue collection was far lower than the f ₹425.24 crore earnings registered in May 2019. The order to levy a 70% ‘special corona fee’ on the MRP of every liquor bottle was issued by the Delhi government on May 4. The government had, on May 22, deliberated over revoking the cess after several representatives form the liquor industry demanded a roll-back. However, the government decided to defer the roll-back plan until next month at least. Opposing several pleas challenging the imposition of 70% cess on liquor, advocate Gautam Narayan, the additional standing counsel for the government, told the court that owing to the lockdown, the revenue which the state earned through GST/ VAT was reduced by 90% in the month of April 2020. “A citizen has no fundamental right to do trade or business in liquor or for that matter also to consume liquor. On the other hand, the state has the authority and jurisdiction to regulate (including prohibit—totally or partially) such trade and commerce as well as to regulate the sale, purchase and consumption of liquor,” the affidavit filed by the government read.“In other words, there is an element of privilege viz a viz sale/dealing in liquor or for that matter consumption of liquor, which the state is free to accord and regulate under the state excise law….. Accordingly, the state is also free to impose and recover a price for the grant of such privilege,” the affidavit stated. The Delhi government also contended that owing to the clampdown on all economic activities due to Covid-19 lockdown, “the revenue of Delhi government (which primarily comes from VAT/GST collection, state excise and stamp duty) shrunk by almost 90% in April 2020 and the total collections dwindled to a mere ₹300 crore as opposed to approximately ₹4,000 crore in the corresponding month of 2019”.According to the affidavit, between May 4 and 25, the total sale of operational liquor vends has been ₹187 crore, which is way too less as compared to the sale figures of May 2019, as the number of shops operational last year were around 800, of which only 40% are currently open due to lockdown restrictions.The matter will be heard on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-cites-element-of-privilege-for-70-tax-on-liquor/story-CSlOrCkOb6XNLztIy5gd5I.html
28-05-2020||Gurugram||Haryana caps Covid-19 test rate at ₹2,500 in private labs for government collected samples||The Haryana government has fixed the price of reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test used to detect coronavirus disease (Covid-19) between ₹ 2,500 and ₹3,950 after negotiations with three authorised private labs that are actively conducting tests in the state. This cost, which includes logistics and cost of transporting the samples, is lower than the ₹4, 500 which was the ceiling price fixed earlier by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to conduct RT-PCR tests.The ICMR on May 25 had allowed the state governments to negotiate with approved private labs and fix mutually agreeable prices for testing samples. The Haryana health department on May 15 has signed memorandum of understanding (MoU) with three labs – Core, Pathfinder and Modern – to conduct RT-PCR tests at the revised rates.As per the order issued by Haryana Medical Services Corporation Limited (HMSCL) on Thursday, ₹2,500 will be charged for every sample if the health department collects its and uses their own transportation to deliver it to one of the three labs. In case, the sample is collected by the staff at but it is picked up by private labs for testing, the price will increase to ₹3,200. It will further increase to ₹3,950, if the sample collection, logistics, testing and reporting is done by the private labs completely. These rates have been fixed as one-third for screening and two-third for confirmatory test.Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department said, “We had entered into negotiations with three private labs even before the ICMR issued the orders and fixed the rates. Three labs- Core, Pathfinder and Model – had agreed to these rates on May 15.”As per the ICMR letter issued on May 25, based on the cost of imported kits and efforts involved in carrying out the test, the upper limit for a single test was set at ₹4,500 in March. However, since testing supplies had stabilised and varied options of testing materials/kits including indigenous ones being available, prices had become competitive and are undergoing reduction, the letter had said.The letter said the earlier suggested upper ceiling of ₹4,500 may not be applicable now ,and states have to negotiate with private labs and fix up mutually agreeable prices for samples being sent by the government.In Haryana—besides Rohtak, Hisar, Sonepat, Karnal, Nallhar and Panchkula where government labs are conducting RT-PCR tests— a bulk of samples are being sent to authorised private labs to be tested against Covid-19 testing. According to an official in the HMSCL, who is privy to the matter said, “Samples go in bulk to these labs, which includes at least ₹700 transportion cost for every sample. It is up to the district level officers to opt for any of these packages based on the proximity of labs,” he said.According to Arora, nearly 99% of the samples in the states are collected at government hospitals which are further transported to these private labs for testing.Though seven labs authorised by ICMR are allowed to conduct RT-PCR in the state, three labs have signed an MoU with the Haryana government so far. As per the MoU the labs will have to collect samples and test it within a defined time period. As per the norms laid down, labs need to ensure samples are collected from a spot within two hours and test results are delivered within 36 hours.The MOU also says that if the results of a sample are not delivered within the stipulated time, the government would deduct 20% of the testing cost of the sample.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-caps-covid-19-test-rate-at-2-500-in-private-labs-for-government-collected-samples/story-orSxk5k3KEeTyniYv6sztL.html
28-05-2020||Mumbai||48 hours and over 130 calls later, Covid-positive mother and son from Sion get hospital beds||Despite attempts by the civic body to ensure sufficient beds for the growing number of Covid-19 patients, many continue to find it difficult to get treatment in the city. Recently, a family struggled for almost 48 hours as it tried to get beds for two relatives.A 32-year-old Sion resident’s mother, 52, and brother, 33, tested positive on May 13 morning at a private lab after complaints of throat pain, breathlessness, high fever, and loss of appetite.What followed for two days thereafter were constant calls on the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) helpline and several other hospitals to get them admitted, the 32-year-old man recalls.“We were told by four different hospitals that there are no beds. While people from BMC did keep calling us, they could not help us find beds. One of the BMC employees also told me that I had called them almost 132 times,” he said.The mother and brother were finally admitted to KJ Somaiya Hospital on May 14 midnight after they got in touch with a relative, a doctor from Pune. “It was a relief but it proved to be very expensive. I had to pay ₹25,000 every day for my brother and ₹17,000 for my mother. Till date we have paid ₹1.75 lakh and ₹1.50 lakh respectively, for each of them,” the Sion resident said.Though the family has been home since the lockdown began, the man said his mother had stepped out to buy fruits and vegetables a few times. “We were panicking. It was a complete mess for two days when all we did was call different people to somehow get them admitted,” he said, adding that he is now awaiting test results for his father, who has been admitted to a hospital in Chembur due to gastroenteritis.The rising number of cases in Mumbai has stretched thin the availability of beds at the city hospitals in the last few weeks. F/N ward (which includes Sion) has 2,377 cases as of May 27, data by BMC shows. A civic official said that the mounting cases are making it difficult for BMC to cope with the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/48-hours-and-over-130-calls-later-covid-positive-mother-and-son-from-sion-get-hospital-beds/story-jdTl7SwqcUDQx77U5gelsI.html
28-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC allows shifting 955 Tablighi foreign attendees from quarantine centres||The Delhi High Court on Thursday allowed for 955 foreigners who attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Nizamuddin in March from quarantine centres to alternative accommodations after the Centre, Delhi government and Delhi Police said they had no objection.The bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rajnish Bhatnagar gave the order after receiving the status report from the Delhi government’s revenue department. The report said that the central government had not arrested or detained of the foreigners, who are accused of violating visa rules and endangering lives by attending the congregation when the government had restricted such public gatherings due to the spread of Covid-19. It also added that a case has been registered and charge sheets have been filed against them.The foreigners were accommodated in quarantine centres across the city. Appearing for the petitioners, senior advocates Rebecca John and advocate Ashima Mandla, said that the foreigners had tested negative for Covid-19 and requested that they be sent to an alternative place of accommodations as they were being “illegally detained” in these centres.

28-05-2020||Noida||Residents, developers hassled by containment zone plan, urge govt to revise it||Residents and developers have demanded that the Uttar Pradesh government and the Gautam Budh Nagar administration change the ongoing containment zone plan that is “generally fit for villages and small towns and not for group housing towers in Noida and Greater Noida”.Uttar Pradesh chief secretary RK Tiwari Thursday said he will address their genuine grievances pertaining to the containment zone plan.On Tuesday, residents of Supertech Ecovillage 1 had held a protest against the authority’s move to seal the entire society after three Covid-19 cases were reported from the housing complex. They also ran social media campaigns highlighting how the restrictions were hampering their work. This prompted the district administration to redefine containment zone plan for high-rises by late Tuesday. The administration said if there is only one case, then officials will only seal the tower concerned. However, if ther are ore than one case, then all tower s in a 500m radius will be sealed for 21 days.But residents argue that since members of a family are likely to contract the disease from the one positive person, the change in rules is of no benefit to them as the locality invariably ends up being sealed.Apart from residents of Supertech Ecovillage 1 in Sector 1, residents of Panchsheel Greens 2 in Sector 16 and Hynish society in Sector 1, Greater Noida West, have demanded that only those towers, from where the Covid-19 positive cases are reported, should be sealed instead of the entire society. They said as offices, industrial units and factories have reopened, working professionals are unable to go to offices and are on the verge of losing jobs as a result of the containment zone plan, which they termed was “faulty”.Supertech Ecovillage 1 has a total 61 towers of which 20 are under-construction and 41 towers are lived in by at least 3,200 families. “One resident, a journalist, tested positive for Covid-19 on May 23 and, later, his wife and child also tested positive. Subsequently, the administration has sealed all 61 towers stopping the movement of all 3200 families. Instead, they should have sealed just the one tower where the journalist lived and allowed the others to go about their daily lives as usual. People would lose jobs if these towers will remain sealed for the next 21 days, and that is only if no fresh case is reported or else the sealing will be extended,” Abhishek Kumar, a resident of this society and president of Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association, said.Similarly, the administration has sealed all 22 towers of Panchsheel Greens 2 and 12 towers of Hynish society in after more than one case was reported from these societies.“After our society was sealed, my son cannot go to his office and we have to walk in this heat to fetch essential items. It would have been better if the administration had sealed only the tower from which the Covid-19 cases were reported,” Rani Mahajan, a senior citizen of Panchsheel Greens, said.Developers have requested district magistrate Suhas LY and Tiwari to change containment zone plan as they are unable to carry out construction work on the remaining towers.“We have 400 migrant construction labourers at our Hynish and Panshcheel Green 2 site. If they stay without work at the site for a long time, then they will return to their villages. Since even under-construction towers are sealed,our business is suffering hugely,” Ashok Chaudhary, promoter, Panchsheel Group, said.DM Suhas said, “According to the state government guidelines, we seal a tower if there is one Covid-19 case. And if there is more than one case, then we treat the area in a 500m radius and declare it a containment zone. Also, an area of 250m, outside the containment zone, is declared a buffer zone. We have to follow the state government guidelines in this regard. But in view of developers and residents’ demands, we have sent a report to the government and asked it to reconsider modifying the rules.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/residents-developers-hassled-by-containment-zone-plan-urge-govt-to-revise-it/story-pqGsBPkrE9ZaaqNcL7FeYO.html
28-05-2020||Delhi||Conduct random pat-down searches to detect non-metallic explosives, BCAS tells CISF||One of every five passengers lined up for a security check at the Delhi airport may randomly be asked to step aside for a thorough pat-down by CISF personnel, a recent circular issued by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) said. Because the CISF is resorting to only contactless frisking, using metal detectors, the latest order will ensure that no “non-metallic explosive” is sneaked into the airport, the circular said.According to the BCAS circular, accessed by HT, “at least one out of every five persons shall be subjected to pat-down search on a continuous random basis on the reasoned selection and in a consistent manner, particularly to mitigate the threat from any non-metallic explosives (sic).”The directions were announced as a standard operating procedure (SOP) to be followed while screening passengers at airports as the government resumed flight operations in the country May 25 onwards.“The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel, who protect the airport, were asked to maintain a safe distance from flyers and use hand-held or door frame metal detectors to frisk them during security checks. They were also directed to tell passengers to put all metallic things in a tray on the x-ray scanner before stepping in for a security check. That tray is to be sanitised after every single use,” a senior officer from the Delhi airport, who wished not to be named, said. The officer added, however, that there was always a threat of someone trying to sneak in with non-metallic explosives, chemicals, or other harmful weapons that may remain undetected by the metal detectors. “The CISF has therefore been directed to identify suspects randomly, yet reasonably, and ask them to cooperate with a thorough pat-down search,” the officer added.Another officer privy to the security of the airport said the direction of the BCAS is also strategic because the security plan of the Delhi airport allows one to reach up to the Security Hold Area (SHA) without any scanning or frisking. “If we solely resort to metal detectors, it may create a security loophole. We also have armed plainclothes men inside the terminal to keep an eye on suspects,” the officer said, requesting anonymity. The latest BCAS order also mentions that if a metal detector raises an alarm because of some metal in a passenger’s shoes, he/she will also have to take the shoes off. It also said that if sealed or otherwise unidentifiable packages are found on any person, they must be checked using x-ray scanners.A CISF spokesperson said the order issued by the BCAS will be diligently followed.Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport also resumed its flight operations on Monday with 118 arrivals and 125 departures, however, at least 82 incoming or departing flights had to be cancelled. While a number of passengers were stranded due to cancelled flights, those who boarded the planes, said the security checks were smooth.The next day on Tuesday, the airport witnessed only 25 cancellations and handled 137 departures and 140 arrivals.On Thursday there were 147 total scheduled departures with 145 arrivals, while on Wednesday the airport handled 129 departures and arrivals each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/conduct-random-pat-down-searches-to-detect-non-metallic-explosives-bcas-tells-cisf/story-x0jrogvJnIbjMCP9cF8PMO.html

28-05-2020||City||Set up help desks for PDS beneficiaries: Delhi HC||New DelhiThe Delhi High Court on Thursday told the Delhi government to put a system in place within a week to ensure charges levied by atta chakkis (neighbourhood flour mills) for grinding wheat are borne by the state.A bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad directed the government to ensure adequate number of mills are identified in each district where non-PDS beneficiaries can go grind wheat without paying.The court said the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) 1301 helpline is a “disaster” that needs to be addressed immediately, while noting that they had tried the helpline numbers themselves but none could connect.“The helpline shall be made functional by the end of this day. The state is cautioned that we propose to personally verify if both the helplines are functioning, by making calls on a random basis,” the court.It said they had personally dialled the Food Helpline No ‘1967’ several times and requested asked the lawyers but no one could connect except ASG Jain. It directed the Delhi government to increase the number of persons manning the food helpline to two for each district.The court was hearing pleas that contended people are not being able to get ration from fair price shops as they were closed. The petitions said due to the absence of any information in the public domain on the distribution of rations in terms of who all have availed of the stipulated quantity, there is no way to determine whether they have been provided to the intended persons or whether there has been any diversion.On Thursday, the counsel for one of the petitioners said the supply of grain to non-PDF beneficiaries was futile as they do not have the money to take it to a local mill to grind it into flour.The court directed the Delhi government to set up help desks at 588 non-PDS distribution centres within five days to assist beneficiaries, noting it would be a serious challenge for the economically distressed sections to apply for e-coupons at the links provided by the Delhi government for issuing ration.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Jain and additional standing counsel (Delhi government) said the helpdesks would be done within five days.Appearing for NGO Delhi Rozi Roti Abhiyan Adhikaar, senior advocate Sanjay Parikh and advocate Prasanna S, told the court that the beneficiaries were facing a great deal of difficulty as they do not know who to approach and where to get these Emergency Food Relief coupons.The court directed the Delhi government to issue an advisory to all MPs and MLAs to identify particular locations where help desks can be set up by them for streamlining distribution of the coupons within a specified timeline.“The details of the locations identified, shall be uploaded on the website of the Delhi Government within five working days. The information shall be disseminated through print and electronic media, including by putting up information on notice boards at all 588 designated non-PDS centres for the information of the concerned beneficiaries and to enable them to approach the Help desks in their areas,” the court said in a seven-page order.The court asked the commissioner, food supply, Delhi government to file an affidavit, updating the action taken within two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/set-up-help-desks-for-pds-beneficiaries-delhi-hc/story-QhtkB0LuhELqVRNeX6aoVP.html
28-05-2020||Ranchi||‘Dream come true’, say migrants as they deboard special flight at Ranchi airport||Shankar Mandal, a migrant labourer who worked as tiles fitter in Mumbai, was nervous on Thursday morning, as he was to catch a flight for the first time in his life from Mumbai airport, which he never thought would be possible even in his wildest dream.Mandal, a resident of Hazraribag road in Jharkhand, boarded the flight along with his family and 10 other relatives from Mumbai for Birsa Munda airport Ranchi. The special chartered relief flight of Air Asia, carrying 174 migrant workers, landed at Ranchi airport at 8.20am on Thursday.“I saw flight flying over my head many a time in Mumbai. But, I never thought that I would be an air passenger ever, as I am a migrant worker and I know my limit. I would like to thank the persons who arranged this for us. They appeared as God for us, as we had exhausted all our savings in the lockdown,” Mandal said.“Sky seemed like heaven”From Mandal’s wife Rita Devi , it was a dream come true moment. “I was scared when the flight started taking off. I felt similar experience while landing. It was a unique experience, as the sky seemed like heaven,” she said.This was the first flight which carried migrant workers to Jharkhand. The state saw arrival of more than 3.5 lakh migrant workers by special trains, buses and individual vehicles since May 1.Boarding a flight was first experience for most of the migrant workers, who were working as carpenter, construction labourer, auto driver, car cleaner, tiles fitter, fitter, electrical mechanic, furniture maker and tailor in Mumbai. It was a struggle surviving in the city with no money to eat after the lockdown, the migrants said.“After one month of lockdown, we started facing crisis of even food. We thought to return to Jharkhand but had no option to come,” said Aslam Ansari, who deboarded the flight in Ranchi with his wife and four kids. Aslam Ansari, a resident of Nawada in Jharkhand’s Giridih district, worked as a tailor in Mumbai and was out of job since March 22.“Thought of walking to Jharkhand along with wife and kids”“Once, we thought to return home walking along with the family members. In the meantime, one of my friends said that a flight for migrant workers is leaving for Jharkhand. Then, I filled a form for the same and got a call for the journey,” Ansari said.The flight journey was possible by the effort of a group of alumni of National Law School, Bengaluru, who raised funds for the journey. The six alumni Suhaan Mukerji, Priyanka Roy, Arkaja Singh, Shyel Trehan, Pria Sharma and Shuva Mandal played a crucial role to make this happen.“Initially, we were trying for buses to send the migrant workers. But, when we compared the cost, we found flight cost is not much higher than the bus. The total cost was around Rs 11 lakh. Then, we decided to send them by flight and started raising fund,” said Mukerji, a Delhi based lawyer, over a phone call.When asked why they chose Jharkhand migrant workers, Mukerji said, “We came to know that 45 people from Jharkhand are stuck in Mumbai. We got 45 seats in regular flight. Unfortunately, the flight got cancelled. We, then, decided let’s take full aircraft and moved the permission for relief flight so the restriction of schedule flight we can overcome. This way, we sent full plane.”“We had sought support for the migrant workers after their landing in Ranchi. Jharkhand CM called me and said he would monitor the things. The government there arranged buses for the workers for various destinations,” Mukerji added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/dream-come-true-say-migrants-as-they-deboard-special-flight-at-ranchi-airport/story-1kWTPF7eddUYlB9aDMmMcL.html

28-05-2020||Gurugram||Deadline for real estate projects extended by six months||In a major relief to real estate developers in the city, the Haryana real estate regulatory authority (H-Rera) on Tuesday extended the registration and completion dates of the real estate projects registered by the authority by six months. The decision was taken following an advisory issued by the union ministry of housing and urban affairs on May 13, regarding the grant of relief to the real estate sector, which had been hit hard by the lockdown imposed to check the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In the absence of such an extension, the developers would have had to pay a heavy penalty for the late delivery of apartments or houses.Dr KK Khandelwal, Chairman, H-Rera said that as per the advisory issued by the ministry, the authority has decided to extend the registration and completion dates of real estate projects automatically by six months. “No fresh applications need to be made and the extension of timelines of all statutory compliances is automatic,” he said. The authority in its order said that in view of the situation created by the Covid-19 pandemic and the consequent nationwide lockdown from March 25, an urgent meeting of Central Advisory Council was held on April 29 and, as per its recommendations, the ministry had issued an advisory regarding extension of timelines of all statutory compliances due to the ‘Force Majeure’ clause under the provisions of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2016 on May 13, 2020.Developers in Gurugram, meanwhile, said that while extending the deadline will help them but they wanted the state government to help the sector more as the industry was facing difficulties. “We want the government to reschedule payments of EDC/IDC (external and infrastructure development charges) for the time period. The payment of all other levies and fees should also be relaxed and for the time being. All penalties should be extended,” said Prashant Solomon, managing director, Chintels Developer and spokesperson for CREDAI (Real Estate Developers’ Association of India) , Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/deadline-for-real-estate-projects-extended-by-six-months/story-wne9cWlN47xHvYfzbUKK4K.html
28-05-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram to reserve 1,000 hospital beds, offer paid quarantine facilities||The state health department along with the district administration is gearing up to tackle the Covid-19 cases in Gurugram, which is likely to witness a spike in the coming days owing to ease in inter-district and inter-state movements and expected lockdown relaxations after May 31. The administration is going to reserve 1,000 beds for Covid patients in different hospitals, while roping in 12 hotels as paid isolation facility for asymptomatic patients and preparing an epidemiological plan. Senior state health officials on Thursday held a meeting to review preparedness and take stock of the Covid-19 situation of the city, which has so far witnessed 405 cases with three deaths.Rajeeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, who held the meeting with the district administration on Thursday said, “Since the city is opening up gradually, a lot of people from different cities and those from Gurugram or Faridabad will start moving around freely. A spike in cases is expected. Therefore, we are focusing on paid isolation facilities and simultaneously increasing beds for critical care patients.”According to him, asymptomatic patients can be kept in hotels instead of them occupying beds at hospitals. “The purpose is to prevent the spread of coronavirus in densely populated areas. People who are asymptomatic during contact tracing can opt to stay at these hotels. Apart from this, there will be paid government facilities where people can stay.”Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, on Thursday issued an order for self-paid and government paid isolation facility. “People who do not have requisite space at home can opt for facilities such as hotels and guest houses,” reads the order. Those testing positive in a containment zone and wanting to be treated at home will have to give a written consent.According to Arora, the district administration has been adviced to divide the city into five to seven zones for easy management of cases. “Along with the health teams, district administration officials will be deployed in these areas to tackle the Covid-19 situation.”EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PLANIn a statement issued by the district administration, Rajesh Khullar, principal secretary to chief minister, directed district officials to prepare an epidemiological model to make future projections of Covid-19 cases based on the data collated so far. A senior official privy to the matter, who attended the video conference of officials, said, “District administration has been asked to take help from private consultancy groups. The report has to be submitted at the earliest.”INCREASING BED CAPACITYKeshani Anand Arora, Haryana chief secretary, has directed the administration to create enough beds for Covid-19 patients. Around 1000-beds have to be kept ready in Gurugram, out of which 500 should have oxygen equipment and 100 must have ventilators.Arora said there are eight to nine private hospitals in the city with more than 500-bed capacity. “If 50% of their beds are reserved for Covid-19 patients, it will be sufficient in case tehre is a spike in the number of cases,” reads the administration statement. The district administration on Monday issued an order making it mandatory for all private to treat Covid-19 cases. Currently patients are admitted to 100-bed ESIC Hospital, 30-bed Civil Hospital, 50-bed Medeor Hospital (whose capacity will be increased to 120) and a few other private hospitals only.USING TECHNOLOGY“Arogya Setu application will now be extensively used for effective contact tracing. The plan is ti streamline testing where people can be immediately tested after they come in contact with a Covid-19 patient,” said Arora. He said that a separate portal will be created where all Covid-19 information will be shared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-to-reserve-1-000-hospital-beds-offer-paid-quarantine-facilities/story-TLwgCZXFQWMeN3qKu5Q3tK.html

28-05-2020||Gurugram||City bus service to resume early next month||The Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited (GMCBL) is likely to relaunch the city’s Gurugaman bus service in early June, once Lockdown 4.0 has ended. Officials said that a standard operating procedure(SOP) for staff and commuters is in the process of being drafted and that measures such as thermal scanning, foot-operated hand sanitisers, alternate seating arrangements and cashless ticketing will be the new norm in city buses in the coming months. Sonal Goel, CEO, GMCBL, on Thursday held a meeting at the city bus depot in Sector 10 to discuss these arrangements with the Gurugaman staff. While Goel did not respond to requests for comment, a spokesperson confirmed that the CEO has instructed officials to work on setting up smart card counters at select bus stops to promote cashless ticketing.“We cannot stop taking cash, but smart cards have a lower chance of contact so we are going to aggressively promote them,” said Vanita Akhaury, spokesperson, GMCBL. She also confirmed that a significant dip in ridership is expected. “People are not travelling. Moreover, we are ourselves going to limit the number of commuters per bus. No two consecutive seats can be occupied, and no standing passengers will be allowed,” she explained.In addition to these steps, the service will operate fewer buses at a lesser frequency, and also possibly with lesser (or revised) routes. The SOP document, expected to be finalised by the weekend, will contain the necessary details, said Akhaury. Since suspending operations on March 24, when Gurugram district went into lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19, Gurugaman buses have been deployed across the city as sample-collection labs for testing, as roving grocery markets catering to RWAs, in distributing food and ration to migrant workers, and also as a conveyance for health department officials working in the field. Foreign returnees travelling from Delhi airport to quarantine centres in Gurugram are also being ferried using a fleet of 15 city buses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-bus-service-to-resume-early-next-month/story-yMAD9Toj5j5N0yAZTtARyN.html

28-05-2020||City||NCRTC to expedite work on Delhi-Gurugram-Alwar rapid rail project||Gurugram: The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) said Thursday it has begun expediting pending work on the upcoming Delhi-Gurugram-Alwar regional rapid transport system (RRTS) corridor, which had been delayed due to the nationwide lockdown. According to the corporation, road widening between the IDLP Complex and the Atul Kataria Chowk in Gurugram, work for which had been held up due to absence of labour, will “commence shortly”, and that tenders for various components of the project are now being finalised. Officials said design work on the corridor is being done remotely, and has picked up pace in the past two months. “We are still in a detailed-design stage. Unlike the Delhi-Meerut RRTS corridor, where there has been some slight fall back in the construction schedule, the Delhi-Alwar corridor is not affected so severely. To the contrary, we have been solely focusing on planning and design aspects for now so that they can be implemented as soon as the Centre’s approval for construction is received,” said Sudhir Sharma, spokesperson, NCRTC. At present, this corridor has not yet received the Centre’s nod, seeing as the nodal ministry for the project. However, Sharma added that due to the absence of traffic in the past two months, officials were able to carry out other pre-construction works in Gurugram smoothly. “A water pipeline of the GMDA’s which was in the way of the alignment has been successfully shifted. We are now moving on to shifting of high-tension lines,” Sharma added.The NCRTC also undertook pre-construction tunnelling studies during the lockdown, he said. “The Delhi-Rajasthan route has several tunnels in the alignment, some as much as six-seven kilometres long. During the lockdown, we undertook pre-construction studies to ensure proper ventilation for workers inside these tunnels once construction work commences. These are design-related concerns which are being addressed currently,” Sharma added.Meanwhile, various tenders for design and construction, which were held up during the lockdown, are now in the final stage and are likely to be awarded in the coming weeks. These include tenders for detailed-design consultations (DDC), and civil constructions for viaducts, tunnels and RRTS stations between Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi and the Shahjahanpur-Neemrana-Behror Urban Complex in Rajasthan, as per an NCRTC press release on Thursday. The corridor will service parts of Delhi, Gurugram, Rewari and Alwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ncrtc-to-expedite-work-on-delhi-gurugram-alwar-rapid-rail-project/story-C8cV4VjGrXmNUElhJafkWN.html
28-05-2020||Mumbai||SoBo day temperature crosses 35°C-mark for 1st time in May; pre-monsoon showers expected from June first week||South Mumbai witnessed its hottest day of the month so far on Thursday while the weather bureau said the city can expect pre-monsoon showers in the first week of June.The Colaba weather observatory recorded a day temperature of 35.2 degrees Celsius (1.1 degree Celsius above normal) with the mercury crossing the 35 degree Celsius mark for the first time this month. The highest day temperature in south Mumbai had ranged between 34.8 and 35 degree Celsius on a few days. On the other hand, Santacruz which is representative of the suburbs recorded 34.5 degrees Celsius, 0.7 degree Celsius above normal.Last year the highest maximum temperature recorded in May was of 36 degrees Celsius on May 20. The highest monthly maximum over the past 10 years was on May 1 and May 10, 2010, and all-time high maximum May temperature was 41 degrees Celsius on May 12, 1979.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Thursday said in view of the development of a low-pressure area over southeast Arabian Sea between May 31 and June 4 conditions would be favourable for southwest monsoon over Kerala around June 1. “There are two weather systems in the Arabian Sea, one towards southwest Arabian Sea which is likely to develop into a cyclone and will move northwestwards towards Oman and Yemen not affecting the Indian coastline. A second system in southeast Arabian Sea, closer to the west coast, will allow monsoon progression and lead to pre-monsoon showers over most parts of the west coast during June first week,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general, IMD.According to present weather models shared by IMD Mumbai officials, pre-monsoon showers are expected over parts of south Konkan around May 31 while north Konkan, including Mumbai, can receive rain from June 2 onwards. “Advisory has been issued to the fishing communities along the west coast to avoid fishing over west central Arabian Sea between May 29 and June 1, and southeast and east-central Arabian Sea between May 29 and June 4,” said Mohapatra.Private weather forecasting agency Skymet said pre-monsoon showers are expected over Mumbai between June 1 and 3. “Possibility of rain is there from May 31 as the low pressure over southeast Arabian Sea is likely to intensify into a weather depression. However, since its trajectory is moving closer to the coast it will start losing moisture. This will ensure the system does not develop into a tropical cyclone,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sobo-day-temperature-crosses-35-c-mark-for-1st-time-in-may-pre-monsoon-showers-expected-from-june-first-week/story-zjCBPpHJk40BfkopUQ4rpI.html

28-05-2020||Mumbai||Three including a Nigerian national arrested for duping businessman of ₹15.81 lakh||The Mumbai crime branch’s property cell arrested three accused including a Nigerian national on Thursday for allegedly duping a south Mumbai-based businessman to the tune of Rs15.81 lakh. The arrested accused have been identified as Santosh Jha, 35, a resident of Kandivli; Moses Tula, 45, a resident of Malad, and Kadiri Ali, 51, a Nigerian national who resides in Vasai.The victim, who is into pharmaceutical business and has his office at Dawa Bajar in south Mumbai, registered a case in LT Marg police station on May 12 stating that he had purchased medicine from another businessman on credit and had pending dues of Rs15.81 lakh. But due to the lockdown, he could not make the payment. He further stated that he received a mail asking him to clear the dues and the email id was similar to the one used by the other businessman, where the fraudsters had changed an alphabet which went unnoticed by him, asking him to transfer the pending dues into the bank account mentioned in the email, said police inspector Kedari Pawar of the property cell.“The victim did not verify and transferred all dues. The amount was transferred in the Jha’s bank account and as soon as the amount came in the bank Jha withdrew 11 lakh within an hour before the victim realised,” said Pawar. An hour later the victim called the businessman who used to supply him medicine, to verify whether he has received the money or not and learnt that he was duped by the accused. The victim immediately alerted the concerned bank and asked them to stop the transactions, added Pawar. The crime branch started conducting the parallel inquiry and arrested Ojha and later other suspects. They were produced in the court and remanded in the police custody till June 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/three-including-a-nigerian-national-arrested-for-duping-businessman-of-15-81-lakh/story-PwamfQdgDg3Rzsh4a1dsRK.html
28-05-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka state election commission postpones gram panchayat polls||The Karnataka state election commission has decided to temporarily postpone the elections scheduled for the gram panchayats in the state. This decision has been taken after adequate examination and consideration due to Covid-19 pandemic spread.The state election commission in a release said that due to the current ‘extraordinary circumstances’ prevalent because of the pandemic they have arrived at this decision under article 243 – K of the Constitution. A decision would be taken in the near future when elections can be held.There are 6025 gram panchayats in the state of which the term of 5800 of them expires in June. The state government had requested the election commission on March 30 itself to postpone the polls.

28-05-2020||City||Delhi govt schools to distribute books among students till class 8||New Delhi: As transport facilities are being relaxed across Delhi, the Directorate of Education has asked government schools to prepare a schedule for distribution of books for students from classes 1 to 8. Under Right to Education Act, which mandates providing free elementary education to children up to class 8, students are entitled to receive books and reimbursement for uniform and stationery from schools.Following the closure of educational institutions in Delhi since March 16 to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, thousands of students were locked inside their homes without course textbooks even as the new academic session began in April. While the government used means such as WhatsApp and text messages to send daily learning activities to students, lack of textbooks at home slowed down the learning process.“A proper schedule for distribution of books is to be prepared at the school level so that books that have been received by the schools till now are distributed immediately and the remaining books may be distributed after they are received by the school,” the Directorate of Education wrote to the government schools on Tuesday.The education department recommended calling parents to the schools in separate time slots for different classes while maintaining social distancing measures and mandatory sanitation guidelines. Parents will be asked to sanitise their hands before entering the premises and a staff member with a sanitiser will be deputed at the gate for the same. Not more than 10 parents should be allowed to enter a classroom at any given point of time.“Along with books, sanitary napkins (available stock in the school) may be distributed to the eligible girl students,” the circular stated. Under the central government’s Kishori Shakti Yojna scheme, female government school students of classes 6 to 12 are given sanitary napkin packets every month. More than 8 lakh girls benefit from the scheme in Delhi government schools every month.With schools functioning as food distribution, dry ration, and migrant screening centres, overcrowding becomes a major challenge. Shaheed Hemu Kalani Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Lajpat Nagar, which serves as all three centres, is set to begin the book distribution on Friday. Principal Bijesh Kumar Sharma said parents had been informed of the timings through text messages and WhatsApp.“While we have kept separate wings of school for screening and hunger relief centres, managing the crowds remains an issue. Inside the school we have volunteers and teachers to ensure social distancing, but outside the gates it becomes an issue,” he said, adding schools with smaller spaces may have to take extra caution in this regard. “Besides, many of our teachers are concerned over the positive Covid-19 cases among frontline workers. While we are taking all precautions and sanitation measures, the concern is still there,” he said.A senior education department official said the reimbursement for books class 9 and 11 students will be processed soon. “Due to the delay in results for classes 9-12, the process was kept on hold. Since we have declared the results for class 9 and 11, the reimbursement will be transferred to their bank accounts soon.”“We are keeping a tab on who are collecting the books. A parent, who is currently in Bihar, called me today. So we made some provisions for a relative to collect it. We want to ensure students have that assurance that they have their books with them to study. This is in addition to the NCERT e-books they have on their phones,” said Rakesh Semalty, principal of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Nand Nagri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-schools-to-distribute-books-among-students-till-class-8/story-A5pwWV7NGC4ZsMeN9TIy5H.html

28-05-2020||Mumbai||Former Congress corporator booked for misbehaving with sub-inspector in Mumbai||A former corporator from the Congress was booked on Thursday by Vakola police for allegedly misbehaving with an on-duty police sub-inspector, obstructing her from discharging her duties and threatening to harm her.Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) (operations) and spokesperson of Mumbai Police Pranaya Ashok confirmed the development.According to Vakola police, the incident took place on Wednesday around 10.30pm when the 28-year-old sub- inspector was working as a night duty officer at the station house. The 45-year-old corporator, Brian Miranda, visited the police station along with his wife after a fight broke out between two groups of residents of a society at Pandurang Vakil Wadi in Kalina. Miranda and his wife were supporting one group. The former corporator allegedly started arguing with the officer and called her biased. He also allegedly passed remarks insulting her modesty.Miranda however, has refuted the allegations.“I went to the police station along with my wife as it was night. The sub-inspector was speaking to my wife rudely and was not willing to listen to her. My wife was defending four women in our society who visited the police station to lodge a complaint against another society member who had abused them. I did not misbehave with the officer as I did not even speak to her,” said Miranda.Based on the officer’s complaint, Vakola police lodged a first information report (FIR) under sections 186 (obstructing public servant while discharging public functions), 189 (threat of injury to public servant) and 509 (words, act or gesture intended to insult woman’s modesty) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), as well as the section 110 (behaving indecently in public) of the Maharashtra Police Act, 1951.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/former-congress-corporator-booked-for-misbehaving-with-sub-inspector-in-mumbai/story-yQCxM7o63qA2P6VJdeSbjO.html
28-05-2020||Kolkata||Cyclone Amphan: Visva Bharati teachers donate Rs 1 lakh to CM s relief fund||The Visva Bharati Faculty Association has donated Rs 1 lakh to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund for the people affected by Cyclone Amphan, a senior member of the association said on Thursday.The amount was handed over to the Block Development Officer of Bolpur on Wednesday. “The association raised Rs 1 lakh. More financial contributions will be made to the relief fund by teachers in the coming days,” Visva Bharati faculty member Sudipta Bhattacharya said.The Visva Bharati university authorities had in a notification on May 24 said that one day’s salary would be deducted from all permanent staff members for contribution to the CM’s relief fund to “stand by those who are in dire need of food and shelter”.The notification, issued by the officiating registrar, said the amount will be deposited by the central university on June 3.The faculty association, however, expressed reservations about the notice saying that employees should be given the opportunity to donate voluntarily through whatever means they find suitable.“We strongly demand that the notice should be revised with a clear option given to the employees to express their choices with a deadline as it happened in the past.” “As responsible citizens, it is our duty to stand by people during a crisis. During the current Covid-19 crisis, the faculty members have not only donated one day’s salary to the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund through Visva-Bharati, but are also organizing relief work in nearby localities for last two months.“But the authorities cannot deduct a portion of the salary without an employees consent even for donation. It is demeaning for the faculty members and unbecoming of the institute,” Bhattacharya said.The reaction of the Visva Bharati authorities in this regard was not available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/cyclone-amphan-visva-bharati-teachers-donate-rs-1-lakh-to-cm-s-relief-fund/story-VC3q4t1dL0MEC8rTuEDzjP.html
28-05-2020||Kolkata||In fresh trouble for Bengal’s cyclone hit areas, squall kills two||A week after cyclone Amphan ravaged south Bengal, a squall raged through some of the same districts including Kolkata with a speed of nearly 100 km per hour on Wednesday evening, killing at least two persons and hampering cyclone relief work.One person was killed and two others injured when a tree fell on them in Howrah. In another incident one person was killed and five others were injured when a wall collapsed during the squall that lasted about half an hour. Some new pockets in parts of South 24 Parganas and North Parganas – the two worst cyclone-hit districts – have been inundated after the squall and heavy rains. In some villages which were already inundated since May 20, the water level increased following the squall which hampered relief work.“Thousands of villagers who were living under polythene sheets and tarpaulins have once again been affected as the storm has blown away all the tarpaulin and polythene sheets. We need to distribute these items once again. Besides this the water level has risen which has worsened the condition,” said Sukumar Mahata, MLA of Sandeshkhali in North 24 Parganas.Cyclone Amphan which had affected around eight districts had left more than one million homeless. Around 100 million have been affected. The state government has already distributed more than a million tarpaulin sheets to those whose houses have been damaged.At Bagda in North 24 Parganas, dozens of irate villagers barged into the panchayat office and looted around 500 tarpaulin sheets. It has been estimated that around 16 km of river embankments and around 4 km of sea dykes have been damaged by cyclone Amphan. Saline water had gushed into the villages during the cyclone and the storm surge it had triggered. More than 10 lakh hectares of croplands have been destroyed and large areas are still submerged.“In four villages, every time the high tide comes, we have to plug the breaches in the river’s embankments with nearly 400 sandbags. When the water level falls during low tide, the sandbags are removed so that the water which had gushed into the villages during the storm and has got stranded, can be drained out. At least 80 people have been deployed in each of these four villages to do the job four times a day,” said S Mitra, the block development officer of Gosaba, one of the worst hit blocks in South 24 Parganas.But soon after the squall and rain several pockets in the Sunderban and coastal districts got inundated again.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has asked the district administration to repair the embankments and dykes on a war-footing effort as the spring tide during the full moon on June 6 could further aggravate matters as was seen a month after cyclone Aila in 2009.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-fresh-trouble-for-bengal-s-cyclone-hit-areas-squall-kills-two/story-d4YaAken2V1Dl6Di5R84PM.html

28-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab govt’s move to stop free power to farmers ‘midsummer madness’: Sukhbir||Chandigarh: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday slammed the Punjab government for its move to abolish free power on the pretext of replacing it with direct benefit transfer (DBT) of subsidy.In a statement, Sukhbir said the move is a curtain-raiser for the total abolition of the free power facility for farmers introduced by the Parkash Singh Badal-led SAD-BJP government in 1997. “This is midsummer madness by the Congress government in the state and a shocking assault on the already beleaguered peasantry,” he said, convening an emergency meeting of the SAD core committee in Chandigarh on May 30 to discuss the party’s strategy on the issue.The Punjab cabinet had on Wednesday agreed in-principle to switch from free electricity to cash transfer of subsidy to farmers’ bank accounts from the next fiscal to become eligible for additional borrowing under reforms-linked enhancement announced by the central government. The SAD chief said the direct benefit transfer policy means that meters will now be installed on farmers’ tubewells and they will be forced to pay the bills. “As for the promised refund later, we all know the record of this government which has failed to pay even medical and TA bills and often faulted on even the salaries of its employees. Who can trust this government’s word on reimbursement to farmers?” he said.He said the Congress had, in its earlier tenure from 2002-07 also, abolished free power and the SAD along with farmers had launched an agitation to force the government to resume it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-govt-s-move-to-stop-free-power-to-farmers-midsummer-madness-sukhbir/story-Tvsj57wNxsH1vBKRlXQXfP.html

Any applicant missing the appointment will have to apply for a fresh slot and jumping the queue or adjusting a person without booking will not be possible, he said in a press note here on Thursday.The STC said another feature which has been enabled is that the result of the test and processing of the licence will have to be initiated the same day. “The slots which will be available at each track have been limited to 40 to ensure social distancing in light of coronavirus,” he said, adding that the earlier procedure will continue for learner licence.He said no late fee will be charged for renewal of all documents issued under the Motor Vehicle Act, including driving licences that expired from February 2020 onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/driving-test-to-start-from-june-1-in-punjab/story-rnUiiCs2M3QnYZ6hQ9d54O.html
28-05-2020||Jaipur||About 90,000 hectares hit by locust in 20 Rajasthan districts||About 90,000 hectares in 20 districts of Rajasthan have been affected due to the locust attack, an official said Thursday. Swarms of locust have moved from Sri Ganganagar, Nagaur, Jaipur, Dausa, Karauli and Swai Madhopur towards other areas in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh after the authorities conducted operations to tackle them. Crop over 4,000 hectares in Sri Ganganagar and 100 hectares in Nagaur have been destroyed. Around 90,000 hectares in 20 districts have been affected in the state due to the locust attack, said Om Prakash, Commissioner of the Agriculture Department. He said the department carried out locust control operations on 67,000 hectares. Swarms of locust can travel up to 150 km a day with a speed of 15-20 km per hour and since there is no standing crop in the fields, they are targeting trees and other available vegetation, the official said. He said the non-availability of standing crops is the reason behind their movement from Pakistan to India. Talking about the locust control operations, he said 800 tractors with mounted sprayers are being used to neutralise locusts. About 200 teams are involved in daily survey and farmers are being given free pesticides, he said. Swarms of locust had recently entered some residential areas of Jaipur and settled on trees and walls. After a few hours, the insects moved towards Dausa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/about-90-000-hectares-hit-by-locust-in-20-rajasthan-districts/story-Vw0lgrFPOyikonNo4VSdiO.html
28-05-2020||Chandigarh||Bindal’s resignation bid to divert attention from scam in Himachal health dept: Virbhadra||Shimla: Senior Congress leader and former chief minister Virbhadra Singh on Thursday condemned the corruption in the state health department, saying Rajeev Bindal’s resignation as state BJP president is a bid to divert public attention from the scam and infighting in his party.In a statement, he said that the medical equipment scam during Covid-19 times had exposed the BJP’s “so-called honesty”. The arrest of then health director Dr AK Gupta shows BJP leaders are linked to the scam.He said in his 60-year political career he had never seen a party involved in corruption during a calamity.He sought a probe by a sitting high court judge since the department is under chief minister Jai Ram Thakur.“The state government is not paying attention to problems of farmers, orchardists and the common man. It did not implement suggestions given by the Congress. The state BJP president refused to conduct a special Vidhan Sabha session sought by Congress and BJP MLAs. Infighting is going on and that is their internal matter, but people should not suffer,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bindal-s-resignation-bid-to-divert-attention-from-scam-in-himachal-health-dept-virbhadra/story-bjuol9CHfHPF7wE9o2qB6N.html

Out of job and with little savings left, Kumar said he might have to go back to the western metropolis if he is unable to find a job in Arwal, his home district.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage After failed attempts to find a berth in a ‘Shramik Special’ train, Kumar had bought a plane ticket with almost all the money he had saved to reach Bihar, but the government, shortly after, shelved its plan to resume flight operations in mid-May. Left with no choice, he coughed up Rs 8,500 to book a seat in a private bus, which was ferrying migrants to Daltonganj in Jharkhand. “I used to get a monthly salary of Rs 16,000 working for an eyewear wholesaler in Mumbai. I barely managed to save money after meeting all expenses. Now, I have little money left, and my future hangs in a balance with no job opportunity in sight amid the lockdown,” Kumar said. After an exasperating bus journey for five days, he reached Daltonganj on May 20, and returned to his native place at Chulhan Bigha in Arwal district with help from his relatives. He is currently undergoing 14-day quarantine at an isolation centre near his place. Along with him, over 50 other fellow migrants, many of them Surat returnees, are lodged at a quarantine centre in Pirawa panchayat area of the district. Vijay Kumar, a middle-aged daily wager who lost his job at a private concern in Surat, told PTI over phone, “I had no money left to pay rent. I thought it was best to return home.” Vijay, who earned Rs 500 per day, said he was lucky to have got a berth in a Shramik Special train. “The factory owner gave around 500 of us eight kilogramme of foodgrains and vegetables, before shutting down the unit on May 22,” he said. “Big cities extend hospitality only till you work there. Once out of work, it is difficult to arrange two meals a day. Cashless and hungry, hundreds of us returned to our native places in Bihar,” Vijay added. Narrating his travel woes, Vishal Kumar said 35 of them travelled in a bus, which made stops at dhabas where they had ‘dal-roti’ in a hurry. For nature calls, too, they had to patiently wait for the bus to stop at remote locations, he said. The two, however, were all praise for the arrangements made by the state government for housing migrants at the quarantine centres. “We got ‘Balti kit’ (bucket, towel, soap among other things) and comfortable beds set up in the classrooms of a middle school, which has been converted into a quarantine centre,” Vishal said. He, was, however, sceptical about his job prospects in this eastern state. “As soon as I step out of the quarantine centre, I will start looking for a job. My ‘malik’ (employer) said I could return to work once the situation improves... But amid the Covid-19 crisis, I don’t want to return anytime soon. If I don’t find anything here, I may have to catch a train to Mumbai,” he noted. Lakhs of migrants who have hurried back home in Bihar, walking, peddling bicycles and hitchhiking their way to their native places, are no longer sure if they would be able to live by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mantra of “Jaan Bhi Jahaan Bhi” (life as well as livelihood). The Bihar government has promised to make livelihood arrangements for the returnees after mapping their skills, but with so many having returned to the state from metropolises, it remains to be seen if they would stay put to dig earth or lay bricks under the MGNREGA scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/hurrying-back-home-to-skip-covid-fury-migrant-workers-in-bihar-stare-at-uncertain-future/story-LuYFRLAe4NvFyyHIfR4yeM.html

28-05-2020||Chandigarh||Randhir Sharma tipped to be working president of Himachal BJP after Rajeev Bindal’s exit||SHIMLA: A day after Rajeev Bindal stepped down as the Himachal Pradesh BJP chief, party sources said that the high command is likely to appoint former Naina Devi legislator Randhir Sharma as working president till a new leader is elected.The sources said the working president could be appointed in a day or two. Sharma belongs to Bilaspur, the home district of BJP national president JP Nadda, and was in the race for the post in January also but the party favoured Bindal, who went on to serve as state unit chief for four months.The sources said that eventually the state party chief’s post may go to Kangra district and bigger changes were likely in the Himachal unit.However, in this entire episode, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur has strengthened his position.Bindal, 56, had in a video message posted on social media, cited moral grounds for quitting the post on Wednesday after his name was indirectly dragged into a corruption case involving the state health department.Incidentally, it was his second video message, the first was sent just an hour ago propagating Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plan to organise a virtual rally on May 30 to highlight the achievements on the completion of one year of the National Democratic Alliance government’s second term.Nadda accepted Bindal’s resignation within hours.But this was the epilogue.THE PROLOGUEThe events that unfolded when the BJP came to power in December 2017 provided a prologue to the episode. Bindal, a five-time legislator, was expecting an important berth in the government.However, the power struggle that ensued due to the defeat of veteran leader Prem Kumar Dhumal in the assembly elections, resulted in Jai Ram Thakur becoming the chief minister and Bindal was made speaker of the Vidhan Sabha. All were happy except Bindal.In 2020, amid several names doing the rounds for the new party chief, Bindal emerged as the final choice. Bindal said he was happier to serve in the organisation.However, his elevation did not go down will with certain party leaders and they were waiting for an opportunity.COUP-DE-GRÂCEHowever, even his detractors hadn’t expected the moment to arrive so soon. What better time than during the Covid-19 pandemic. The day the medical equipment purchase scam in the state health department surfaced, hushed voices discussed its political connection.Health department director Dr AK Gupta was suspended and arrested for the scam days before he was to retire. He was said to be close to several ruling party leaders and some of them had even proposed his name to the chief minister for an extension.Initially, there were references and later fingers were directly pointed at Bindal. His detractors added fuel to the fire.Tremors were also felt in the power corridors in Delhi. Unhappy with the whole episode, the high command discussed the issue with chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, while the Prime Minister’s Office appointed a nodal officer to oversee the probe.Jai Ram Thakur is learnt to have told the high command that the scam had brought a bad name to the party and the state government, particularly after the name of a leader had cropped up.The plot was enough to throw the captain out of the ship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/randhir-sharma-tipped-to-be-working-president-of-himachal-bjp-after-rajeev-bindal-s-exit/story-JSgz9JfESs6nKXlObf4JlL.html

28-05-2020||Patna||Nitish ‘shielding’ JD(U) MLA accused of murder: Tejashwi||RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav on Wednesday charged Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of “shielding” a JD (U) MLA, named in a triple murder case, and demanded the legislator’s immediate arrest.He said if the MLA is not arrested at the earliest, he along with supporters would march to the home turf of the accused.Tejashwi Yadav made the statement at a press conference that he convened in the morning at the residence of his mother and former chief minister Rabri Devi.He alleged that the police was not arresting Amarendra Nath Pandey alias Pappu Pandey, who represents the Kuchaikote assembly segment in Gopalganj district, since he was close to Nitish Kumar, who heads the Janata Dal (United).Pandey has been named in an FIR lodged in connection with the attack that took place on Sunday night at the residence of Gopalganj-based RJD leader J P Yadav, who suffered grievous injuries while his parents and a brother were killed.Pandey’s brother and nephew have been arrested even though the MLA is being traced by police. “Nitish Kumar is shielding the MLA. I warn the government, if Pappu Pandey is not arrested by Thursday evening, I will take all MLAs of my party along and march to Gopalganj seeking justice,” said Tejashwi Yadav whose father and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad was born and brought up in Gopalganj.In a tweet, Deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi took strong exception to the use of the word ‘narsanhaar’ (massacre) by the RJD leader while referring to the triple murder and recalled the mass killings by rival ultra-Left groups and private militias of landlords that used to make headlines when Lalu Prasad-Rabri Devi together ruled Bihar for 15 years.The 30-year-old RJD leader, who has been named by the party as its chief ministerial candidate for the assembly elections due later this year, chose to step up the offensive and met Governor Fagu Chauhan at the Raj Bhavan.Tejashwi Yadav submitted a memorandum drawing the governors attention towards the Gopalganj killings, The RJD leader claimed the killings indicated collapse of law and order.Statements were put out both the JD(U) and the BJP debunking Tejashwi Yadav’s allegation of collapse of law and order and asserted that the state government will not spare whoever is found guilty.However, Tejashwi Yadav, who is known for his composure, remained livid over the issue and his Twitter handle was abuzz with posts about the Gopalganj killings. Meanwhile, Tejashwi Yadav’s extreme anguish over an incident that involved a lower rank official of his party who had switched over from the CPI(ML) to the RJD a few months ago left alliance partner RLSP amused.RLSP national general secretary and chief spokesman Madhaw Anand said in a statement there can be no two views about the horrendousness of the killings and the need for bringing to justice its perpetrators. “But we wish Tejashwi Yadav were most consistent in his sense of outrage,” he said.“There have been so many instances of violence, which he has refused to take note of simply because the accused happened to be from his Yadav clan while the victims were upper caste Bhumihars. Tejashwi Yadav needs to show a big heart if he wants to make it big in politics,” Anand said.The MLA Amarendra Nath Pandey, meanwhile, appeared on a few regional news channels pleading innocence and alleging that Sunday’s killings have sparked violence from RJD supporters in Gopalganj whom he blamed for the murder of his cousin, shot dead by unidentified motorcyclists on the previous night.

28-05-2020||Lucknow||In rural Lucknow, boys join sisters in making sanitary pads||In much of India, the word ‘menstruation’ is taboo and a large part of the population, particularly women, shies away from talking about menstrual products out of embarrassment. But in rural Malihabad (Lucknow) two girls Aneesha and Deeksha are enlisting their brothers’ help to sew sanitary pads. “I was happy to see that my brother, who is in Class 8, did not feel ashamed to make sanitary napkins with me. Everyone thinks that menstruation is a curse, but it’s a natural, healthy process,” said Aneesha Kanaujia, who appeared in Class 12 UP Board exam and is awaiting her result.Her brother Anmol enjoyed the new experience, saying, “At first I didn’t know what she was making. But then she explained it to me and told me about menstrual hygiene. I think many people feel ashamed discussing this topic because they don’t know how important it is.”The good thing was that no one in the family objected to their work. “Our parents never opposed the idea and allowed us to work together in stitching sanitary pads,” Aneesha said.Another girl Deeksha saw this lockdown period as an opportunity to do something for other girls who lack access to menstrual products. “There are so many girls who don’t have money to buy pads,” she said, adding. “I want to make more pads and distribute them among the girls who need them.”Deeksha has also appeared in Class 12 exam and is preparing for entrance examination to seek admission to Delhi University.Like Anmol, Deeksha’s brother Himanshu, who is in Class 9, said he also learned a lot from his sister about menstruation and menstrual hygiene. “My sister explained about menstrual hygiene and I helped her in stitching sanitary pads which she distributed among adolescent girls who are not financially well off,” Himanshu said. This campaign to make sanitary napkins is being coordinated by Zarine García, director of Youth Leadership at Study Hall Educational Foundation.Even amidst the lockdown, the campaign has given these kids from Malihabad the opportunity to spread awareness about menstrual hygiene and being about a positive change. However, both girls were of the view that disposable pads were a drain on women and their families and had the problem of disposing them of .“It is heartening to see these kids take the discussion home to their families to eliminate stigma and spread the message that periods are natural and nothing to be ashamed of. This May, in honor of Menstrual Hygiene Day, our students are learning to sew their own cloth sanitary napkins at home, and daring to break age-old taboos by drying them outside in the sun,” said Garcia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-malihabad-boys-join-sisters-in-making-sanitary-pads/story-Oj0fzJMOMQR7qxID75ScPK.html

The number of beds in the hospital isolation wards should be increased. Additional isolation centres may be set up at government buildings.“The state government has got a large number of structures built, some of which are lying unused. These should come in handy. Private premises, including hotels, can also be acquired for the purpose,” he told the meeting.The meeting was attended among others by state Health Minister Mangal Pandey, Chief Secretary Deepak Kumar and Principal Secretary, Health, Uday Singh Kumawat.The chief minister’s directive came in the backdrop of a huge spike in the number of Covid-19 cases during the month. The state has registered over 2,500 fresh cases so far this month, mainly on account of a large number of migrant labourers returning home by special trains.Kumar also reiterated the need to increase the number of tests being conducted every day, with a special emphasis on those coming from outside Bihar, and said, “The private sector too should have facilities for detecting coronavirus.” He also stressed the need for “being positive” towards the migrants who return home upon completing their stay at the quarantine centres for the stipulated period of time, besides the infected patients discharged from hospitals upon full recovery.“They have endured untold sufferings.

Thats why I was caught in a trap, the NCP leader said on Wednesday while addressing an online seminar organised by BDA, a developers lobby.Notably, in the early days of Covid-19 outbreak in the state, Awhad, who is the guardian minister of Thane district, was seen moving around for relief work.The minister said it was his will power that helped him overcome the tough phase, and added that he has recovered fast in the last two weeks.Awhad said he considers himself lucky to have recovered so fast, when compared with the travails of others like an IAS officer of Maharashtra cadre having to import medicines or undergo plasma therapy.The minister said his hemoglobin level, which had dropped, has gone up and he is currently following a strict diet at specified timings.Another state Cabinet minister, who is a senior Congress leader, also tested positive for coronavirus recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-housing-minister-blames-his-reckless-behaviour-for-contracting-covid/story-n4Ea2wJrweR8XjD1zpxQIO.html

28-05-2020||Kolkata||BJP’s 9-point attack over Bengal govt’s respone to Covid-19, Cyclone Amphan||The opposition BJP in West Bengal listed nine “failures” of the Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal as it sharpened its attack on the Mamata Banerjee dispensation on Wednesday over the state’s response to the Covid-19 outbreak and the devastation caused by cyclone ‘Amphan’.State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said the list has been prepared in view of the present situation in West Bengal.The party said that the government has squarely failed in tackling the Covid-19 crisis and the state’s health infrastructure is on the verge of collapse.This, Ghosh said, has threatened the lives of the people.The BJP also charged the government for “failing” to deal with the devastation caused by the cyclone.Even after seven days, people of the state are in distress as many areas are still without electricity and water, he said.The BJP also attacked the government, alleging failure in distributing foodgrains among the people.It said that foodgrains were being diverted by workers of the ruling party and sold at high prices in the black market.The BJP alleged that the state’s economy is in ruins, and law and order have collapsed.Further, it alleged breakdown of the educational system in West Bengal, besides stating that the Trinamool Congress government is against the refugees.The BJP said the government is “anti-farmer” and “thrives on cut money and other irregular means”.Referring to the return of migrant workers, Ghosh said that if Maharashtra is willing to send back those from West Bengal and the railways is providing logistics, then why the state is so reluctant to receive them.He dismissed fears that the return of migrant workers may lead to a spike in Covid-19 cases.“Even if migrant workers do not come, cases of Covid- 19 will rise in the state,” Ghosh claimed.The BJP has been persistently attacking the TMC government raising these issues, leading to a war of words with the ruling party as the state faces the dual crisis of Covid-19 outbreak and cyclone ‘Amphan’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bjp-s-9-point-attack-over-bengal-govt-s-respone-to-covid-19-cyclone-amphan/story-z6ysFvAQhlDSXd3wJxsoMM.html

My mother had given me this responsibility,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Sirhulli village in the poor eastern state of Bihar.“We even hitched a ride on a truck for about 50 kms, but giving up was nowhere on my mind,” she said after cycling for more than a week.Tens of thousands of migrant workers were forced to make their own way home when India announced one of the world’s strictest lockdowns and their work disappeared overnight.Scores fell ill or died along the way as they walked hundreds of miles in intense heat after most public transport was halted.Kumari had travelled from Bihar to visit her father, a rickshaw driver, in March after an accident left him unable to cycle, and stayed on to cook and clean for him.Her story of grit and determination captured the imagination of people across the country, with images of her on a pink bicycle with her father going viral on social media.India’s cycling federation invited her for trials and U.S. presidential adviser Ivanka Trump drew criticism for praising her, with opposition figures saying the pair’s desperate journey was not something to celebrate.Health experts say India’s vast lockdown has helped limit the spread of COVID-19, but it has pushed millions who live on daily wages to the brink of poverty.After weeks of mounting criticism and tales of hardship, the government is now running trains and buses to help the migrants get home.Carrying just a small bag of flattened rice and a few clothes, the two mainly survived on biscuits and food given to them by people when they took rest breaks at roadsides and fuel stations.When they arrived, she said, all she wanted to do was “sleep and eat dal-bhaat (rice and lentils)”.Since then, local politicians and journalists have made a beeline to meet Kumari - to her bemusement.She has said she did not regularly attend school in the past because the family was poor and she had chores at home, but now intends to resume her studies.Bihar is one of India’s most under-developed and conservative states, where child marriage is rife and girls are routinely denied education.“I never thought I would be famous,” said the shy teenager, who frequently asked her father to speak for her during the interview. “I think people are fascinated because I am a girl.”(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

28-05-2020||Kolkata||Restore normalcy in districts hit by Cyclone Amphan, CM Mamata tells officials||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday directed officials to carry out restoration works on war-footing to bring back normalcy in the districts ravaged by Cyclone Amphan. She also advised them to constitute task forces in the districts, which should include MLAs, Zilla Parishad members, local police station officers to constantly monitor relief works.During a review meeting at the state secretariat, Banerjee said priority should be given to installing tube wells and rebuilding damaged embankments as the rainy season is approaching. “We have to complete restoration works on a war-footing. We have to rebuild the embankments which have been destroyed. The Sundarbans has been devastated. Embankments in areas like Sunderbans, Sagardweep and Namkhana are in very bad shape. We have to rebuild them before the monsoon sets in,” she said at the meeting.Availability of drinking water should also be ensured with high priority, Banerjee said, adding that Rs 100 crore was disbursed to install tube wells in the affected districts.“Ensure that all the victims get relief materials. I am ready to beg to provide them relief,” she added.Cyclone Amphan has affected at least eight districts, but North and South 24 Parganas bore the maximum brunt and their district magistrates must work on war footing along with superintendents of police, the chief minister said. The home secretary and the irrigation secretary will be camping in North and South 24 Parganas districts respectively for the next three days to oversee the restoration work. She also said that around 4.5 lakh electric poles have been uprooted in the districts and it would be difficult to fix new poles until the water recedes. “Around 90 per cent of restoration works of electricity has been done and only 10 per cent is remaining,” she said. Banerjee lauded the officials for evacuating over 8.5 lakh people before the landfall of the cyclone on May 20. There could have been nearly six lakh casualties otherwise, she said. Cyclone Amphan claimed 87 lives in the state while around two lakh people are currently in relief camps.“Around six crore people have been directly affected by Cyclone Amphan and 10 crore indirectly. More than 60 per cent of the state’s population has been affected,” the chief minister added. She also said the state-owned West Bengal State Electricity Board carried out restoration work in the power sector better than CESC, a private utility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/restore-normalcy-in-districts-hit-by-cyclone-amphan-cm-mamata-tells-officials/story-YnakWSax1Ihou27Zo8PuaN.html

Only principal secretary (health) is the appropriate authority to answer the issue.”Principal secretary (health) Anurag Agrawal said the state had a liberal policy on Covid-19. “We have included even those in the list who had comorbidities. We are diligently conducting tests of the dead to find the source. In some cases, the deceased, who tested Covid-19 positive in the first test, was found negative in the repeat test. In the context of the two cases, I do not have the details.”State epidemiologist Dr Rajesh Bhasker said, “The details of the two deceased were not shared by the district authorities, otherwise they would be on the list.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-covid-toll-12-two-cases-found-positive-after-death-not-included-in-list/story-dJgd7nRAzzvLNqTEKwBP1J.html

The accused are Jagraj Singh, the former sarpanch, and then panchayat secretary Jasjeet Singh. The alleged embezzlement took place between 2013 and 18. According to the probe, the two forged signatures of other members on panchayat resolutions, besides misappropriating the funds.The report prepared by then district development and panchayat officer (DDPO) Lakhwinder Singh Randhawa stated, “It was found that the panchayat had revenue (grants and funds) of Rs 1.79 crore, Rs 98 lakh expenditure while Rs 21.53 lakh was deposited in the bank accounts. The record shows a shortfall of Rs 59.75 lakh and officials have failed to give any explanation. It was also found that payments were made without passing panchayat resolutions.” Block development and panchayat officer (BDPO) Sukhwinder Sidhu said several notices were issued to the accused to clarify the shortfall or deposit the money but they failed to comply. A case has been registered against the accused under Section 409 (criminal breach of trust by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).‘Implicated in fake rape case for pursuing case’The complainant in the case, Veer Singh, alleged that he was implicated in a false rape case in 2018 by the accused to stop him from pursuing the complaint against them. “I had gathered the information on the gram panchayat’s working through RTIs. After finding irregularities, I reported this to the department. A false case was registered against me in May 2018 and my bail was rejected by the lower court,” he said.“Later, my son contacted that woman, who had levelled fake rape allegations against me. He filmed the conversation in which she tells how she implicated me in a false case. We submitted the evidence in the Punjab and Haryana high court and to the Punjab director general of police (DGP) after which the case was dismissed,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ex-sarpanch-panchayat-secretary-booked-for-embezzling-rs-59-75-lakh-in-punjab/story-2yS6MxTmGDQt0k6nvvw5cJ.html

Moreover, the corporation, which is running just 10% of its fleet of 1,073 buses, is unable even to recover the operational costs, including maintenance and fuel expenses.Presently, the state-run buses are plying only on inter-district routes and the government is yet to give nod to the private transporters to begin service.The corporation faced a loss of Rs 51 crore in the first 60 days of the lockdown, with average daily loss pegged at Rs 85 lakh.PRTC managing director Jaskaran Singh said, “In the first few days, as many as 80 buses were pressed into service and 30 more have been added. On an average, 3,000 people are commuting in theses buses daily. The number is very less as per our expectations.”“The operational cost, including maintenance, can be recovered only if there is more than 60% of seat occupancy,” he said.Before the state government banned public transport service in wake of the pandemic on March 20, the corporation recorded a daily income of Rs 1.40 crore. Its monthly income has been estimated at Rs 42 crore.“We will take up the issue of financial losses during and after the lockdown with the state government so as to get some monetary assistance,” Singh said.PRTC chairman KK Sharma said the people are reluctant to use public transport due to fear of spread of the coronavirus.“The low occupancy could be gauged from the fact that even on key routes like Patiala-Chandigarh, not more that 15 commuters have boarded a bus so far. The spending on diesel per bus is more than fare collection,” Sharma said.They are appealing to people to travel in corporation buses as these are properly sanitised before every journey, he added. “The general managers have been asked to implement the time table so that the commuters do not face any inconvenience,” he said. Another official said with no income during the lockdown, the corporation exhausted its savings and funds in paying salaries and pensions to its employees for March and April.“However, with poor response after resumption of services, it will be difficult for the corporation to meet its committed liabilities, amounting Rs 46 crore per month, in the coming months,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/with-30-seat-occupancy-prtc-stares-at-huge-losses/story-4RZ0pQK2duE9f6UmCbTcuK.html

Also, the state recorded its 18th casualty due to the virus with the death of a 53-year old woman in Faridabad.Senior doctors said she also had chronic renal ailments. Faridabad district has recorded seven of the total 18 deaths due to Covid-19.Faridabad also reported maximum cases (25) on Wednesday, which included two foreign-returnees (from Afghanistan and Oman), followed by Gurugram (20), Sonepat (11), Palwal (8), Jhajjar (4) Rohtak and Narnaul (3 each) and Karnal and Sirsa (1 each). The data showed that more than 55% cumulative cases and about 60% active cases were from three districts — Faridabad, Gurugram and Sonepat. Most of the new cases, doctors said, were contacts of already infected persons or those who had been visiting Delhi from Faridabad and Gurugram.11 TEST POSITIVE IN SONEPATThe Sonepat cases included two couples, a 20-year-old woman, a 15-year-old girl, a 42-year-old labourer and a 44-year-old woman, who worked at a private factory.

A 22-year-old man with travel history to Delhi was also found infected in Karnal. In Kurukshetra too, a 22-year-old labourer was tested positive. SUDDEN SPURT BRINGS DOWNS RECOVERY RATEEven though 14 more patients were discharged after their treatment, the recent spurt in new cases brought down the recovery rate of Haryana in the past few days.

28-05-2020||Chandigarh||Bright spark for PSPCL as Centre removes ‘washed coal’ condition||Cash-strapped Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd. has got a major relief as the Union government has done away with ‘washed coal’ condition for power plants.With this, the PSPCL will save at least ₹400 crore per annum, besides it gets a breather in a contempt petition filed by private thermal plants, seeking ₹2,800-crore coal washing charges from the corporation. It will bring down the power-generation cost in Punjab.Till now, it was mandatory for plants to use washed coal to reduce the ash content. It was a cumbersome process and private plants were demanding washing charges from the PSPCL.Private power plants and PSPCL were caught in a legal battle over coal washing charges. After losing the case in the Supreme Court, the PSPCL were to bear ₹1,790 crore against coal washing charges for the period between 2012 and 2019 (October), along with the future annual burden of ₹400 crore. However, private thermal plants were demanding ₹2,800 crore.To make for the additional burden of ₹1,790 crore, the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) in first week of January this year allowed a surcharge on power consumers, making power costlier by 35 paise per unit in the state.The Supreme Court had directed the PSPCL to pay ₹2,800 crore to Larsen & Toubro (L&T) to compensate it for coal washing and transportation cost. L&T runs Nabha Power Limited (NPL), Rajpura, and Talwandi Sabo Power Plant under a power purchase agreement it had signed with the power corporation.The overall impact of the judgment would have been ₹8,000 crore in next 20 years, the remaining time period of PSPCL’s power purchase agreement with L&T, which the PSPCL will now save.When contacted, PSPCL CMD Baldev Singh Sran said the Union environment ministry’s step is welcome as it will prove most beneficial for Punjab. “Doing away with coal washing will help us save ₹400 crore per year. It will ultimately reduce power production cost and benefit consumers accordingly,” said Sran, adding “now the legal battle over coal washing charges has become infructuous. It’s a major relief for PSPCL”.WHAT IS COAL WASHING CHARGES AND LEGAL TROUBLE FOR PSPCLThe issue pertains to washing charges and measuring calorific value of coal at the mine while loading. The PSPCL had rejected the L&T claim to get coal washing charges, saying that as per the PPA and ministry of environment norms, the L&T has to use only washed coal for power generation in Punjab. The L&T contested the PSPCL claim in the Supreme Court saying the PPA mentions using only washed coal, but the washing charges, which comes around ₹500 crore annually for both thermal plants, have to borne by the power distributor. The power regulator and appellate tribunal for electricity had passed orders in favour of the PSPCL, but the apex court overturned it.As the PSPCL didn’t implement the earlier judgment in toto, L&T filed a contempt petition in 2019, in which apex court again reiterated that the point of measuring the calorific value of coal for power plants would be at the project site. And the cost of washing coal could be added to the tariff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bright-spark-for-pspcl-as-centre-removes-washed-coal-condition/story-QelreGR7XXAVqjdzdntfKP.html
28-05-2020||Chandigarh||84-year grandma a lockdown star with soulful singing of Punjabi folk song||When Mumbai-based actor Mansi Multani recorded a favourite song of her maternal grandmother and posted it on her Timeline on the Facebook she had not anticipated that it would become the quarantine hit.The folk song, ‘Pauna ni mein laal ghaghra’ (I want to wear a red skirt), was sung melodiously and went straight to the hearts of the people leading it to be shared copiously on social media and appearing in WhatsApp with the silver-haired beauty, charming one and all with her joie-de-vivre.A guessing game started on the singer’s identity and someone decided that this was the 93-year-old yesteryear film star Kamini Kaushal singing and thus the post circulated till rebuttals started coming from many music buffs, including Sunaini, grand-daughter of famous Punjabi singer late Surinder Kaur, who said: “The song is beautifully sung but she is not Kamini Kaushal auntie!”Certainly not, she is Romila Arora who had migrated with her family and parents from Lahore to Delhi at the time of The Partition in 1947. Looking back she says, “I was very fond of singing and would copy all the songs I heard. In Delhi, I would participate in the children’s singing programmes of All India Radio.” Her grand-daughter Mansi adds, “She could not pursue her music and after completing studies, she worked in the Punjab National Bank to augment the family income of the migrant family as she was the eldest of six siblings.” Mansi adds that her grandma had been her inspiration and it was this particular song which had become the grand finale for a prominent play ‘Piya Behrupia’, Atul Kumar’s musical adaptation of Shakespeare’s ‘Twelfth Night’ which was part of the London Cultural Olympics in 2012.Romila, who moved from Kolkata after her husband’s death, chose to live at a senior citizens’ complex in Bhiwadi to be independent as well as close to her children in Delhi. “I am very happy to be in Bhiwadi as I did not want to live in Delhi and they take good care of us here.” Mansi, who shares a special bond with her, says, “I decided to record some of her songs to preserve the magic of her singing and I had no idea what a warm response she would get from the people!” Romila in turn adds, “Mansi is taking forward my love of music and it gives me joy to hear her sing so well.”An endearing shot before the singing is when grandma chides Mansi that it is important for her to arrange her ‘dupatta’ because the senior woman wants to look ‘nice’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/84-year-grandma-a-lockdown-star-with-soulful-singing-of-punjabi-folk-song/story-EE9mFTHuD1uoAUAFLifYDO.html
28-05-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 toll may go up as hospital reports 53 previous deaths||The number of deaths reported due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi may see a spike, with the Safdarjung hospital on Wednesday informing the Capital’s audit committee about 53 deaths that occurred between February 1 and May 16, according to officials.The national capital on Wednesday recorded 792 fresh Covid-19 cases, the steepest single-day rise, taking the overall infections to 15,257. The official death toll rose to 303, but the figure did not include the fatalities newly reported by the Safdarjung hospital.“The 53 deaths were reported from the hospital between February 1 and May 16... We report the progress of every case, including deaths, to the health ministry every day, twice a day,” said Dr Balvinder Singh, medical superintendent of the hospital, which is run by the central government.The Delhi government said the hospital reported the big jump in deaths only on Wednesday. “The Delhi government had issued strict orders to all hospitals to submit their death summaries to the death audit committee within 24 hours. We have even sent reminders to all hospitals for compliance of the same. All our Delhi government hospitals are submitting their reports to the committee daily,” a spokesperson of the Delhi government said.“It (the hospital) had reported only four deaths till now. The government is seriously looking at why this delay has happened,” the spokesperson added.On May 10, Delhi’s chief secretary, Vijay Dev, ordered all designated Covid-19 hospitals to report the deaths each day by 5pm. But the hospitals have been lax in reporting them along with the requisite documentation.A senior official from Delhi’s health department confirmed that the deaths were yet to be added to Delhi’s official death toll. “This (the lag in reporting) is the reason there have been delays in adding the deaths to the daily bulletin. The government adds the numbers as soon as the death review committee gets the files – case sheets, investigations, death summary – and determines it indeed is a Covd-19 death,” the official said on condition of anonymity.If the 49 deaths – four fatalities from the Safdarjung hospital have already been added to the official tally – were approved by the Delhi audit committee, the official figure on Wednesday would have stood at 352, taking the case fatality rate to 2.3%, up from the current 2%.The case fatality rate is crucial in helping governments assess their response to the disease and in determining the course of action in terms of preparedness and effectiveness of the health care system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/toll-may-go-up-as-hospital-reports-53-previous-deaths/story-QkoLS4NUAlSGeukMolkZnL.html
28-05-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 fallout: Amritsar tourism & hospitality industry stares at uncertainty||The tourism and hospitality industry in Amritsar is staring at a bleak future in the wake of the lockdown imposed due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Such is the situation that hotels, restaurants and guest houses, etc, which are directly dependent on tourism, are not only facing huge losses but they see no hope of revival in the near future. There are around 700 hotels and guest houses Amritsar which attracts international as well as domestic tourists. The Golden Temple, Partition Museum, Town Hall, Sadda Pind, War Memorial, Jallianwala Bagh, Attari-Wagah border, Durgiana Temple, Heritage Street, Ram Tirath Complex, Gobind fort and Pul Kanjari etc are among major tourist attraction centres. Besides, it is also known for its gourmet traditions with roadside eateries dishing out delicacies such as kulchas, chhola-bhaturas, tandoori chicken and fried fish, etc. “At this time, we can’t tell exactly how much loss the tourism industry has suffered during the lockdown period, but it has come to a complete halt. Besides hotels and restaurants, taxis and auto-rickshaw drivers as well as street vendors have been impacted badly,” said district tourism officer Gursharan Singh. Before the lockdown, the district had an average footfall of nearly 1 lakh domestic and international tourists on weekdays, and 1.5 lakh on weekends, according to the Punjab tourism department. “We are in touch with the government to revive the industry in near future,” said Singh.Surinder Singh, president, Federation of Hotels and Guest Houses Association, said, “It looks like it will take more than six months to contain the pandemic. Even if the tourists start coming here later, they won’t choose to stay in the hotels or dine at restaurants due to fear of infection. The government should step up to save the tourism industry on which livelihoods of hundreds of thousands are dependent on.”“We are still giving salaries to our staff. We want relief in Goods and Service Tax (GST), municipal corporation tax and in the electricity bills or many hoteliers who have taken loans will be forced to take extreme step,” said the association chairman Harinder Singh. Also, shopkeepers at the Attari border are facing a tough time due to the closure of beating the retreat ceremony for last two-and-a-half months. “There are 28 dhabas in Attari and all of them are closed as we are not finding any customer due to the closure of the retreat ceremony,” said Jagdish Singh, a dhaba owner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-fallout-amritsar-tourism-hospitality-industry-stares-at-uncertainty/story-UfbfAV93vhHDF8tuJiRxBM.html

Vends have been allowed in other vegetable markets of the state, but not in Ludhiana, due to which we are facing trouble in catering to our daily needs.”Ruing losses, the arhtiya association has also been demanding that operations should be allowed for six days a week and the vendors should be allowed to operate inside the mandi.A meeting of fruit arhtiyas was also held on Wednesday. A fruit vendor, Kamal Gumber, said, “The vegetable markets in all other districts are open for six days a week, but the Ludhiana mandi is allowed to operate only for three days. Also, no vendor is allowed to operate in the mandi, which is affecting the sales of arhtiyas. We will be meeting DC Agrawal and cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu to find a solution.”On April 3, following the complaints of a huge gathering at the sabzi mandi, the administration had restricted the sale of vegetables and fruits in the mandi to three days -- Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Only listed suppliers/vendors, who sell vegetables to street vendors in the city’s 95 wards, were issued passes to enter the market. The vendors were also stopped from installing vends.Recently, a committee was formed by DC Agrawal to look into the demand of arhtiyas regarding opening the mandi for six days. The committee led by SDM Amrinder Malhi recommended that the mandi should not be allowed to operate for six days till the time lockdown has been announced in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vendors-seek-permission-to-operate-inside-sabzi-mandi-in-ludhiana/story-TOPIeJ1FvxslSNetfQtqtI.html
28-05-2020||City||Amid labour shortage, Malwa villages reduce land lease rates||With farmers apprehending shortage of labour for paddy sowing, some villages across Malwa have passed resolutions to reduce the lease rate of land that owners charge from farmers. The maximum rate at which land can leased out has been fixed, and it is lower than last year. Farmers operating on lease say that in addition to the labour scenario, they are also worried about procurement of certain varieties of paddy. In the recent past, the Centre has advised Punjab to stop varieties like PUSA-44 to check stubble burning.A farmer claims to have suffered a loss of Rs 30,000 than going ahead with cultivating paddy on leased land. “I had given Rs 30,000 in advance to the land owner in Bimbri village (Sangrur) where I had been farming on 12 acre since 2008. However, when I calculated increased labour rates, I decided not to take the land on lease,” said Gurjant Singh of Nabha’s Dulladdi village.Sukhwinder Singh, sarpanch, Jhaloor village in Barnala, said, “We have passed a resolution that land lease rate will be a maximum of Rs 10,500 per bigha (52,500 per acre) this year. Farmers were reluctant to come forward at Rs 12,000 per bigha (60,000 per acre) due to the high price of labour and uncertainty around government purchase of paddy.”Most villages have now fixed the maximum rate of land for farm lease at between Rs 50,000 and Rs 57,000 per acre. Farmers will have to pay penalties for violation of agreement. In Patiala, Tunga, Kakrala Bhaike, Gaajewas villages, and Gurusar in Bathinda have fixed these rates. In Sangrur, Guara village has fixed the maximum lease at Rs 45,000 per acre for land with lower water accessibility and Rs 50,000 per acre for other pockets. In Delewal (Sangrur) and Shahpur (Patiala) villages, rates were not reduced, but lenders agreed to give up the rent for the area on which the farmer fails to sow paddy. “Short-sighted state government and the Centre failed to provide confidence to migrant labourers and farmers by clarifying uncertainty about paddy procurement of PUSA-44, which is the only variety which gives yield between 30 and 35 quintal per acre. Farmers, however, are engaging with the community and reaching such agreements,” said Harmel Singh Tunga, Nabha president of BKU Ugrahan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-labour-shortage-malwa-villages-reduce-land-lease-rates/story-Lqh73lJi2BQpMZd7n2C2lM.html

Besides, dead bats were also recovered from Gola village. The mango orchard was filled with pungent smell of the bat carcasses that were strewn all across and dogs were spotted eating some of the dead bats. The dead winged mammals were later buried by locals. Some locals had also arranged for water pots at the orchard as some officials had suggested that the bats might have been dying out of thirst and heat stroke. “The bats are dying continuously and today hundreds of more bats were found dead .We have informed authorities about it,” Dhruv Narayan, the orchard owner said. Divisional Forest officer (DFO) Avinash Kumar who took stock of the area said, “We were informed today about fresh deaths of bats but the condition of carcasses suggest that the deaths might have happened 24 to 36 hours before. They might have died on trees and dropped on ground later.” The post mortem report of bats is still awaited from Indian Veterinary Institute (IVRI) Bareilly. “The exact cause of deaths can be cleared once the report comes,” he said. “Rare White Nose Syndrome could be possible reason behind the deaths of bats who feed on flower nector, fruits and insects, said Dr PH Pathak, professor, department of zoology at DDU Gorakhpur University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/more-dead-bats-found-in-gorakhpur/story-VfD45g0j723BSIPv7mQP3N.html

28-05-2020||Chandigarh||No class–no fee: Parents protest outside Mohali school, no response from authorities||Raising slogans of ‘no class–no fee’, parents protested outside St Xavier’s High School in Sector 71, Mohali.Parents had gathered outside the school to get a response to the memorandum submitted by them on May 22, asking the school to revoke the hike in tuition fee, and waiver of development fee for this financial year, to which the school has yet to reply.Even though parents kept protesting, holding aloft posters and banners, for about 45 minutes to meet the principal, but no school authority met them. They even locked the school gate from inside to prevent parents from entering the school building. “We had urged the school to begin online classes, but the management was not keen on it. The school has been issuing only a worksheet on a weekly basis which they upload to the website, without any intimation whatsoever to parents or students. They have not lent any support to resolve issues,” said a parent, Praveen Singh Dadwal.Another parent Raman Arora said, “We are ready to pay the fee provided the school starts online classes. But demanding a hike in tuition fee is not justified during this Covid crisis.”No authority from the school was ready to talk to parents or the media. Sanjay Chauhan, a school employee, who was present on the occasion, said the case regarding paying of fees is pending in Punjab and Haryana high court and the school will follow directives of the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-class-no-fee-parents-protest-outside-mohali-school-no-response-from-authorities/story-EoDSKN3pzGJOVs87zc9xzO.html

28-05-2020||Chandigarh||Carpenter misses train home, now daunted by expenses of newborn in Chandigarh||While waiting in the scorching heat for hours to catch the Shramik special train to Uttar Pradesh, 25-year-old Garima developed labour pains minutes before boarding the train. She was rushed to Manimajra Civil Hospital and within minutes she delivered a baby boy.Sitting outside the gynaecology ward, her husband Pawan, 28, and their 3-year-old son wait earnestly to hold the newborn in their arms. A carpenter by profession, Pawan, from Maalipur village in UP’s Sultanpur district, came to Chandigarh in 2008 seeking a livelihood. The family of three live in a room in Vikas Nagar on rent at ₹2,000. However, the lockdown left him with no work.March 24 being his last working day, he had only ₹11,500 on him for the next three months. “I managed for two months, but had to spent ₹1,500 to transport my wife to the hospital. Then in May, I borrowed a sum of ₹7,000,” he said.When Pawan was left with about ₹1,000, he decided to leave the city. “Although, my wife was due to deliver this month, we took the risk of taking the train home,” he said.On Wednesday at 8 am, the family reached Sector 26, from where they were ferried by bus with other labourers to the railway station. Garima, who was ignoring the pain since morning, found it unbearable by the time they reached the station.Sub inspector Urmila Rao with Government Railway Police (GRP) who was at the railway station said: “When she developed pains, I called the ambulance which arrived in 10-15 minutes and rushed her to the hospital.”Dr Sarita, head of Gynaecology department, Manimajra Civil Hospital, said the woman reached around 12 noon in the second stage of labour. “Within 10-15 minutes of her arrival, she delivered the baby. Both mother and child are safe,” she said.Sitting outside the ward, Pawan said he had been hoping for a baby girl but is happy that mother and child are healthy. Now, with less than ₹2,000 in his pocket, he said, “We will leave for my hometown this week, but as of now I have to meet other expenses such as diapers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/carpenter-misses-train-home-now-daunted-by-expenses-of-newborn-in-chandigarh/story-s4JcF1DMrGjCCzTpKpix9O.html
28-05-2020||Lucknow||UP: Home quarantine guideline brings worries for medical staff||Medical teams attending to Covid-19 patients will now go for home quarantine, instead of facility (hotel) quarantine, after 14 days of duty. But the arrangement has brought worries for the medics who believe that this may put their family members at risk of infection.The state health department had recently issued an order with regard to the new guidelines for quarantine of medical staff.“Going straight home after 14 days of continuous duty means taking infection, if any, back home,” said Pradip Gangwar, president, KGMU employees’ association.“Not all medical workers have big houses and separate rooms for themselves (for home quarantine). Many have elderly and children living with them, who are more vulnerable to contracting infection,” said Seema Shukla, president of the Nursing Staff Association at the PGI, said.On Wednesday, the KGMU had sent its batch of medical staff to hotel quarantine, but the batch working now may have to go home after 14 days of duty. “The university shall adopt new guidelines in a day or two,” said Dr JD Rawat, member of the quarantine committee and senior faculty at KGMU.Different associations have approached institute heads and demanded that the hotel/facility quarantine should continue. “At least seven days of facility quarantine should be allowed, as by then, symptoms, if any, will be clear,” said Amita Srivastava, nursing staff at KGMU who has completed Covid-19 duty and facility quarantine.At the KGMU, about 80 staff members, including doctors, nurses and paramedical staff, are working in the Covid ward that has asymptomatic patients and also those in serious condition or on ventilator support. “At the SGPGI, at least 20 staff members are on Covid duty. The strength reduces with less patients and increases with more,” said Shukla.Similarly, the Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences has 20 staff on Covid-19 duty at any given time. “Many medics live in a one or two room set. In such a situation, some alternatives will have to be worked out,” said Prof AK Tripathi, director of Lohia institute.“The PGI administration has been apprised of the issue. It is a problem for all medical institutes in the state and hence needs attention. Otherwise new hotspots might come up,” added Seema Shukla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-home-quarantine-guideline-brings-worries-for-medical-staff/story-GxZfEVaGJVw2TMhqQeJVGN.html

28-05-2020||Mumbai||SSC Geography score will be the average of marks of five papers||Students who have appeared for their SSC (Class 10) examinations this year will be awarded an average of the marks obtained in the other five subjects for the last paper, Geography, which was cancelled owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, said board officials. The Geography paper was earlier scheduled to take place on March 23. While there is no clarity about when the board will declare results of SSC and HSC exams, an official from the education department said they are likely to be declared by the second week of June“The committee constituted to take a decision has decided to award average scores to students for the Geography paper. Marks will be calculated on the basis of the remaining five papers,” said Shakuntala Kale, chairperson of the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education. In a statement released on Wednesday, the board also announced that marks for work-experience papers for Children with Special Needs, which were also cancelled, will be given as per the average calculated from their remaining papers. The board will consider marks of written exams only when calculating average scores for the cancelled paper. Of the total 600 marks, 480 marks are for written exams and 120 for internal assessments. With the cancellation of 40 marks for Geography, the written total will now be 440. Experts hailed the board’s decision and said that it was a practical step. “The situation is unprecedented. There was no way to reschedule the exam and giving average marks thus seems like the most logical step. In such cases, the board has to ensure that no student loses out due to its decision and thus this seems like a good move,” said Basanti Roy, former secretary of the Mumbai divisional board. “It is a good move to consider the marks of only written exams. Most students score well in internals and if an overall average is taken, it might inflate scores of the paper, which was cancelled,” said Jagdish Indalkar, principal, KVK School, Ghatkopar. Anya Shelar, a parent, said that the board should have given its decision earlier. “If the decision was so simple, it should have been announced earlier. Students had to deal with the additional stress. But we are happy that the board has finally announced it and are now hoping to get the results soon,” she added. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ssc-geography-score-will-be-the-average-of-marks-of-five-papers/story-NtA2zQUpaXmr2VltgkZxGL.html

28-05-2020||City||After 48-hour wait, only 456 board Kerala train||After waiting for more than 48 hours, only 456 people boarded a train to Kerala on Tuesday night. A total of the 1,200 passengers were initially scheduled to board the Shramik special train was supposed to leave Thane for Ernakulam on Sunday evening but was cancelled a few hours before the scheduled departure, leaving passengers stranded.“The train, which was scheduled to depart for Kerala on Sunday, had to be cancelled after a request from the Kerala government,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, Central Railway, Mumbai. The tired and confused passengers who had already reached Thane station on Sunday evening stay put in the area and on platforms.“We had vacated our rented flat, hoping to get into the train on Sunday. We had spent a huge amount to find accommodation near Thane station. We managed to get our names listed in the Shramik train leaving Thane on Tuesday,” said Rajesh Shankaran, 34, resident of Ambernath.The train to Kerala was the first scheduled service from Thane after one train departed from Lokmanya Tilak Terminus at Kurla, Mumbai. When passengers boarded the train after a long wait, they found the coaches dirty and that the train had only seater coaches for the over 24-hour journey. “There were no sleeper coaches. After waiting for around six hours at Thane station on Tuesday, we boarded a train that had no sleeper coaches and was very dirty.

The passengers from Thane, Vasai, Andheri, and Navi Mumbai had reached the station at least four hours before the scheduled time to complete the formalities such as medical test and verification,” he said.On Wednesday, a Shramik special train with 1,700 passengers left Kalyan for Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-48-hour-wait-only-456-board-kerala-train/story-OTughqv5PNPwVOFcOwolaP.html

28-05-2020||Mumbai||Governments pass the buck, migrants suffer||Migrants waiting to reach home had to bear the brunt of the blame game between the state and Central governments over arrangements for Shramik trains. While thousands of migrant workers waited outside various railway stations starting from Tuesday evening in the hope for trains, the ones who managed to board stayed without food or water.Railways minister Piyush Goyal lashed out at the state on Tuesday, accusing the Maharashtra government of not being able to run trains for lack of administrative arrangement, despite the state notifying 147 trains. He said the state had failed to help the migrants reach the stations and provide actual lists of their names.Minorities development minister Nawab Malik on Wednesday retorted saying: “They had notified 49 trains for Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, while the divisional railway manager told us that they cannot run more than 16 trains in a day. We had mobilised thousands of migrants at LTT. Thirty-five trains were released after we forced the railway administration in Mumbai. The minister is just blaming us to defame us, but he should first take reports from his regional offices.”The migrant workers along with their families in the city were seen waiting in queues outside the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT), Vasai and Thane railway stations on Tuesday after the Railways announced operation of 145 Shramik trains . The Railways, however, operated close to 53 trains by midnight, citing fewer passenger arrivals.Migrants who were stranded outside railway stations in the city took to social media to complain. “@PiyushGoyal respected sir. I am stranded in Mumbai, Vasai. Yesterday the administration called us for a train. Today we went to their station and now the official told us that there were no trains. This is the second time they did it to us,” tweeted @Nandini16878608.The workers who managed to board the Shramik trains also stated that no food or water was provided to them. “We boarded the train from LTT station on Tuesday night and are going towards Azamgarh railway station. No food or water provided to us. We are a family of 12. I tweeted about the non-availability of water. At Itarsi railway station on Wednesday afternoon, khichdi and water bottles were given to us. However after that no food or water was provided. We have now reached Jhansi,” said Rajkamal who worked as a computer engineer in Kurla. “We were ready to operate 145 trains and had the trains planned. There was a delay in passenger arrival to railway stations which resulted in crowding outside railway stations. Trains were operated late night on Tuesday to accommodate passengers,” said a railway official who did not want to be named. On Wednesday, the Railways, including Central, Western, Konkan and South Central railway divisions, operated 40 Shramik trains from Maharashtra. The trains were operated to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Kerala. Transport minister and Shiv Sena leader Anil Parab said the state government had demanded 178 trains over the period of next one week, but it doesn’t mean the railways should send them all on a single day. Home minister Anil Deshmukh alleged on Tuesday night that the ministry sent 34 Shramik trains to Maharashtra to ferry migrants to West Bengal, despite the West Bengal government requesting not to do so till May 26 in the wake of Cyclone Amphan. “WB chief secretary Rajiv Sinha had written such a letter to the Rail Ministry on May 22, despite which 34 trains were sent to Maharashtra. Now, Goyal is blaming Maharashtra for not departing the railways notified to originate from our state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/governments-pass-the-buck-migrants-suffer/story-ebwXyZviXhR48NCXHsdAeM.html

The administration had directed PU to handover four of its hostels to them to be used as quarantine facilities.In the letter, the teachers’ body said more than 100 people from Bapu Dham Colony (which has contributed to 74% Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh), including three positive patients, were shifted to girls’ hostel number 8 on Monday.They said the patients were removed from the hostel on Tuesday morning. The letter stated that the safety and well-being of university staffers, mainly daily wagers working in hostel number 8, is at stake due to the unchecked movement of quarantined persons.“At this point, even a single error on the administration’s part can prove disastrous, not only for those living or working on campus, but for the survival of the university itself. As per the administration, these hostels were to be used as the last resort for quarantining purposes only. However, before exhausting other quarantine facilities, a large number of suspected patients were shifted to the hostel,” the letter states.STUDENTS RAISE CONCERNMeanwhile, students have also raised concerns regarding the issue. On Tuesday, Nikhil Narmeta, president of PU’s National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) wrote to the V-C seeking his intervention. He said the administration has shifted people from Bapu Dham colony to girl’s hostel number 8 and some of them were found Covid-19 positive. Now, since all of them are staying at same place, there are chances of the infection spreading.The Panjab University Non Teaching Employees Federation also sought an enquiry be marked into the incident and stern action to be taken against erring officers which has put lives of innocent residents in danger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-teacher-s-body-asks-for-hostels-being-used-as-covid-care-centres-to-be-vacated/story-k4fiJQ1zBKoH2hhmGILcxI.html
28-05-2020||City||Taloja MIDC fears labour shortage after industries open||Even as industries at Taloja Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) in Panvel are looking forward to a government announcement of resuming operations, they fear they will not have enough workers.The Taloja MIDC has around 3 lakh workers, among which, 2.5 lakh are migrants. With many migrant workers leaving the city, the Taloja Industries Association (TIA) said that they would be the worst-affected once they start operations.Satish Shetty, president of TIA, said, “There are 974 industries at Taloja, among them, only 169 which are into essential services are operational. We have been unable to stop migrant employees from leaving city. Since there was no clarity on when the industries would start and food and job security, migrant workers went to their home towns.”Shetty said labourers are paid in cash but they haven’t got salaries since March. “Most owners of the industries live out of Navi Mumbai and they didn’t get an e-pass to come and meet the labourers and convince them to stay,” said Shetty.Taloja industries have a turnover of around Rs60,000 crore a year. The association said they would encourage locals to join after industries open but there will still be a shortfall. It has contacted a few labour contractors.The association has kept its office open all days except Sundays and are in constant touch with those who have decided to stay back.Subodh Prasad, 40, from Ballia in Uttar Pradesh, an employee in a company at Taloja, is doing the rounds of the registration centre for the train journey.“I live with four others in a rented home at Taloja village. We waited for a month and even our employer did not know when industrial activity would start. We are running out of money and food so we have no option but to leave the city,” said Prasad.Mahesh Lala, 32, worked in a chemical unit at Taloja. He will leave for his home in Purnia, Bihar, in the next train.“I don’t know if I will come back. We have nothing left. The house owner asked us to vacate the house if we can’t pay rent,” said Lala, who lives at Taloja village with his wife and three-year-old son.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/taloja-midc-fears-labour-shortage-after-industries-open/story-SHLIA4tbwXrISlmKw1SaCP.html
28-05-2020||Mumbai||Maha cities see rise in ozone levels during lockdown: Nat’l Clean Air Programme tracker||Despite the decline in traffic pollution during the lockdown imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, 10 cities in Maharashtra are reporting an increase in urban ground-level ozone, a harmful pollutant, according to a recent study.The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), comprising Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, and Kalyan, witnessed a 24.8% spike in urban ozone during the first three phases of the lockdown over two months (March 24 to May 24), according to an analysis released as part of the National Clean Air Program (NCAP) tracker on Tuesday by Mumbai-based air quality research group Respirer Living Sciences (RLS) and Delhi-based communications initiative, Climate Trends.The 10 cities in the state with increase in ground-level ozone are Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan, Chandrapur, Aurangabad, Nagpur, Nashik, Pune and Solapur. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) confirmed the findings were accurate.Surface ozone (O3) is a photochemical oxidant, which is formed when volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) chemically react in the presence of heat and sunlight. Ground-level ozone is harmful to humans as it can aggravate asthma, cardiovascular diseases, and other ailments.The latest study found a 10.3% rise in ozone across 10 Indian cities during the first two months of the lockdown. Among monitoring locations across the state, Khadakpada in Kalyan has shown the highest average ozone levels at 70 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m³) against the safe limit of 80μg/m³ (for 24 hours), followed by the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation’s Khutala station in Chandrapur at 64μg/m³. While the concentration ranged between 23-37μg/m³ for MMR, a 50% increase in average O3 levels was witnessed when compared to 2019. Comparatively, a 50% reduction for Mumbai and 58% for Thane was witnessed for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels. NO2 is a result of burning of coal and vehicular exhaust.“The analysis indicates that when NO2 levels remain low, surface ozone is higher as photochemical production can become more efficient during summer months,” said Ronak Sutaria, founder and director, RLS. “Breathing air with high ozone poses a risk for people with asthma and other lung ailments, especially for children, older adults, and those active outdoors such as daily wage workers.”MPCB said it was investigating the spike in the pollutant by comparing different station readings. “Based on our preliminary data collection, ozone is going up across Maharashtra cities,” said SC Kollur, chief scientist, MPCB. “It may be a secondary pollutant arising from the reduction of other major pollutants. Industrial areas do witness such spikes but the increase for major cities comes as a surprise. We have to analyse the source.” For Mumbai, MPCB plans on studying background data from the Borivli station to check reasons for an increase in ozone. “The station data has been unavailable for a week due to a broken cable. The data is crucial as it gives background data, and human-induced emissions are not present,” said Kollur. All 10 Maharashtra cities are part of the NCAP, where the Centre seeks to reduce pollutant concentrations by 20-30% by 2024 with the target pollutant as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). Data was compiled from state pollution control board monitoring stations over two months. The tracker is a web portal that monitors the achievement of state-specific air quality targets for 122 Indian cities, and whether funds released for each city are being appropriately utilised.“The rise in ozone comes as an alert at a time when cities are already facing a health crisis. The findings should equip policy-making and encourage more studies to identify the impact of other pollutants apart from PM,” said Aarti Khosla, director, Climate Trends.A recent study by the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IIT-Delhi), and two Chinese universities also showed a 20% rise in ozone for western parts of India. The study suggested that secondary pollutants such as ozone need to be considered by NCAP. “China witnessed a similar rising trend for ozone and adopted measures to reduce the pollutant. India is already showing an indication of higher O3 when other pollutants reduce. During summer months, the Centre should consider precursors to ozone for non-attainment cities and in addition to PM, O3 has to be kept in mind while preparing action plans,” said Sri Harsha Kota, professor, IIT-Delhi.NCAP apex committee and professor, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, SN Tripathi said, “Ozone has not been a problem in India over the years, barring occasional spikes, which are regularly observed across cities abroad. An increase has been observed during lockdown due to its function as a precursor to declining NOx concentration but has remained below the safe limit. Ozone should be considered by NCAP as a secondary pollutant. Studies show PM followed by ozone contributes to 85-90% human-related adverse health impacts. The current data is giving us the opportunity to understand the O3 mitigation strategy.”The NCAP database also calculated average pollutant levels across 10 Indian cities over two months. PM2.5 was 31.5 μg/m³ showing 33.5% decline from 2019; 71.5 μg/m³ for PM10 (35.7% decline), and 15.4 μg/m³ for NO2 (52.6% decline from last year).NCAP DASHBOARD SHOWS LAPSE IN MONITORING DATAThe NCAP dashboard for 10 Indian cities highlighted the offline functioning of monitors leading to data gaps. The air quality monitors in Mumbai have shown substantially lower uptime (data provided in a given period) during the lockdown period of March 24 to May 24, with Bandra working only for 56% of the time, Borivli at 26% capacity, Colaba at 52%, and the international airport monitor at 69%. Air quality monitors in Worli, Powai, Vile Parle, and Kurla have all given over 95% uptime, indicating reliable data. “Maintenance of air quality monitoring is essential to understand the long-term impact of city-level air pollution trends. Of particular concern is the long-running monitoring done in Bandra which has shown as 42% fall in data provided during the lockdown as compared to the same period in 2019,” said Sutaria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-cities-see-rise-in-ozone-levels-during-lockdown-nat-l-clean-air-programme/story-w2vQpPvZJsKZHVDl2LaREO.html

28-05-2020||Pune||Pune police alert citizens to sim swap cases||The cybercrime cell has warned citizens about a trend of cases related to sim swap. A pre-emptive note was issued by the cybercrime cell about precautions that citizens should take in order to evade sim swap attacks.“We keep a track of the kind of cases received and we have noticed a trend of such cases. This is a precautionary message to the citizens that such attempts are happening,” said DCP Sambhaji Kadam.Sim swap is a process by which your mobile number stops functioning on the sim card in your possession and starts functioning of another sim card, possibly in possession of a fraudster.The fraudsters pose as executives of mobile service provider companies and call the victim with a possible solution for network-related issues like call drop and internet speed, according to the police statement.A 20-digit number is then sent to the victim under the fake pretext of updating the sim card. The caller then asks the victim to forward those digits to 12345. The 10 digit mobile number then becomes inactive of the victim’s phone and becomes active on the sim in the caller’s possession.The cyber cell officials have warned citizens against such calls after complaints of this nature were received. The police have advised against entertaining such callers or forwarding such SMS.In case of a fraud, contact your service provider and the bank accounts where the number is registered. Further, report the matter to a cybercrime police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-police-alert-citizens-to-sim-swap-cases/story-Kyv7mSAEos5Rt2B63noqSO.html
28-05-2020||Delhi||15 more charge sheets against 292 Tablighi foreigners||A day after 20 charge sheets were filed against 82 foreigners who are members of the Tablighi Jamaat, Delhi Police on Wednesday submitted 15 charge sheets indicting 292 more for violation of visa conditions, lockdown rules, spreading Covid-19 and breaking quarantine rules under different sections of the Foreigners Act, the Epidemic Disease Act and IPC. Police said the accused attended a religious congregation at the Markaz, the headquarters of the Tableeghi Jamaat in Nizamuddin, in March. Now, the total number of foreigners chargesheeted in the case has risen to 374 in two days. The police have said that more than 900 people from 34 countries had arrived in India on a tourist visa or e-visa but “illegally indulged in missionary activities and attended the religious congregation, violating their visa rules”. The 15 charge sheets, comprising 13,070 pages, were filed before the duty magistrate at the Saket district court who posted the matter for June 17. Of the 292 foreigners chargesheeted on Wednesday, 80 each are from Bangladesh and Malaysia while 44 and 39 are from Myanmar and Thailand respectively. The others are from countries such as Nepal, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, Tanzania, and South Africa, etc.Senior crime branch officers said that the 292 foreigners belong to 14 different countries. They have all been booked under Section 14 (b) of the Foreigners Act, Section 3 of the Epidemic Disease Act, Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act and four sections (188, 269, 270 and 271) of the Indian Penal Code for violating visa conditions, lockdown rules, spreading the virus, and breaking quarantine rules, the police said in the statement.The punishment for various offences under the penal provisions ranges from six months to eight years of imprisonment. “The visas of all the 374 foreigners have been cancelled by the Central government and they have also been blacklisted for attending religious congregations posing as tourists,” Delhi Police spokesperson Mandeep Singh Randhawa said. A senior investigator, who requested anonymity, said that of the 900-odd foreigners who illegally attended the congregation, the passports of only 723 have been recovered so far.

28-05-2020||Delhi||4 furnaces down, this Delhi crematorium sends bodies back to hospital||Inside the Covid-19 mortuary of the Lok Nayak Hospital, there are 108 bodies. All 80 storage racks are full and there are 28 bodies on the floor, piled on top of each other, officials at the mortuary said.  On Tuesday, eight bodies were returned from the Nigambodh Ghat CNG crematorium because the facility was in no position to accept more bodies for disposal. Only two of its six furnaces were working. Lok Nayak Hospital is the largest dedicated Covid-19 hospital in the city, and its mortuary is the repository of bodies of those who died of the coronavirus disease or are suspected to have died of it. The bodies are wrapped in personal protection (PPE) kits and handled by employees wearing PPE suits. As many as 602 of the total 2,242 Covid-19 patients who are in hospital care across 16 hospitals in Delhi are admitted in the facility, which is not admitting any non-Covid cases at this time. Also read: Mixing patients may worsen Covid-19 spread, warn private hospitalsAs the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths toll mount in the capital, the hospital’s employees are overwhelmed. Delhi reported 792 coronavirus infections on Wednesday, taking the city’s tally to 15,257 since the first Covid-19 case was reported on March 2; 15 more deaths took the toll to 303. A hospital official described the scene in the mortuary. “We are yet to cremate the bodies of those who died five days ago,” the official said on condition of anonymity. “The backlog of such cases is increasing every day. Wearing PPE suits, we stand in the sun in this heat outside the crematorium only to be told in the evening that they cannot accept the bodies. Today there are 28 bodies on the floor lying next to each other or piled on top of each other. Last week, there were 34 .” Also read: 20% beds in 117 private hospitals to be reserved for Covid-19 surgeAt the Nigambodh Ghat electric crematorium, three of the six CNG furnaces were working until Monday; one of them developed a snag the same night. “We could not take the load and hence returned the bodies. On Tuesday, even after working extra hours, we only accepted 15 bodies,” an official at the crematorium said, pointing to a board that contained details of the 15 bodies from across different city hospitals that were acceptedCaught unpreparedOn Tuesday afternoon, when an HT team visited Nigambodh Ghat, workers were rebuilding the three damaged furnaces. Another group of workers was at work on the fourth. The workers said it would take at least two months to rebuild the three damaged chambers. The crematorium has received the bodies of at least 244 Covid-19 or suspected Covid-19 patients till date. “We have fixed the third furnace and it is working now,” said Suman Gupta of the Nigambodh Ghat Sanchalan Samiti, the trust that manages the crematorium. “Nobody was prepared for the surge of bodies related to Covid-19. Until the coronavirus pandemic, we got only 4-5 cases a day. We had to request people to come and use the CNG crematorium. The three defunct machines malfunctioned three to four months ago and it wasn’t a problem then. Ours is not a commercial business. Last week, we finally managed to convince the government to give us the money to fix the three furnaces. Work is on.”North Delhi Municipal Corporation has received ₹ 1.3 crore from Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL) to repair the damaged CNG-based cremation furnaces at Nigambodh Ghat. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage One official at the Nigambodh Ghat crematorium said that even an extension of the daily shift hasn’t helped. “Before the pandemic, the crematorium operated between 9 am and 4 pm. Now it opens at 7 am and shuts operation at 10 pm. Even this is not helping. The workers need at least two hours to dispose a body. Collecting the ashes takes time. We are also helpless,” the official said.Bodies of Covid-19 patients and suspected Covid-19 patients are being taken to the electric crematoriums at Nigambodh Ghat and Punjabi Bagh. At Punjabi Bagh, there are two furnaces. Besides these, four burial grounds for Muslim and Christians have been approved in the Income Tax Office area, Mangolpuri, Madanpur Khadar and Shastri Park. The backlog in disposal of bodies has been caused by non-functioning furnaces at the crematorium, said Dr Suresh Kumar, director of Lok Nayak Hospital . “We had problems until about five days ago. Now it is being sorted. We have space to keep the bodies. The bodies are also being sent to other crematoriums,” he said.Cremation using wood North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s deputy commissioner and spokesperson Ira Singhal said the civic agency has now received orders to cremate bodies using wood as well. Still, the order signed by the municipal health officer said CNG and electric crematoriums were preferable. “The order has been issued so that the number of pending bodies for cremation could be cleared. We are making all efforts to tackle the problem. The three CNG furnaces were working but for the last two days, one developed a problem. The furnace is being repaired. We may be able to use it from tomorrow (Thursday),” she said.Singhal said: “The cremation using wood is also safe. The CNG method was adopted because there was less physical contact with the body. It is safe and adopted by other countries abroad too.”With a large number of bodies being sent to Nigambodh Ghat for last rites, the Delhi government has also posted six officials from the health department to ensure that people follow norms such as physical distancing and other guidelines while the cremation is performed. Utmost precautions are being taken in disposing the bodies, one worker at Nigambodh Ghat said. “The bodies come wrapped in PPE suits. No one is allowed to open the suit. A worker at the furnace and one from the hospital put it in the furnace without removing the suit. We follow this process for all positive as well as suspected cases,” said Vishal, a worker at the Nigambodh Ghat Sanchalan Samiti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/four-furnaces-down-delhi-crematoria-unable-to-handle-bodies-coming-in/story-Vd2I65JT6AnvGZUaZ36kYK.html
28-05-2020||Delhi||Civil supplies dept told to restart doorstep delivery of ration||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has directed the food and civil supplies department to restart the Delhi government’s flagship project of doorstep delivery of ration using electronic point of sale (e-PoS) devices. The direction came after Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan wrote to Kejriwal, urging Delhi to implement the Centre’s ‘one nation, one ration card’ policy.Paswan, in his letter dated May 23, had explained that the inclusion of the national capital in the scheme would mean that 71 lakh ration card holders of Delhi will be able to get their monthly ration from any fair price shop in the country. Using e-PoS devices is key to both the ‘one nation, one ration’ policy and the doorstep delivery of ration, a senior government official said. As per the plan, e-PoS devices are to be given to all the 2,028 fair price shops in Delhi and also to agents who would deliver the monthly ration to the doorstep of card holders. The process includes entering the ration card number into the device, followed by the biometric (fingerprint scanning) of the beneficiary or entering the Aadhaar card details. Once the details are matched with the database, the ration is disbursed to the beneficiary. “I want to point out that Delhi, despite having 100% Aadhaar seeding of its ration card holders and having e-PoS devices in its fair price shops, is not disbursing ration based on biometrics. This is because the Delhi government has stopped the usage of e-PoS for ration distribution from April 2018. This was to be resumed by the Delhi government, but the same has not happened till now,” Paswan’s letter in Hindi said. Responding to this, the chief minister’s office directed additional chief secretary (home) Satya Gopal, who is the nodal officer for Covid in Delhi, to ensure implementation of doorstep delivery of ration through e-POS. “Following the directions, we have sent all our e-PoS machines to Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) for its health check since they have not been in use for a long time. There were also some software glitches that we were facing which has been resolved now,” said a senior government official on condition of anonymity. 32 LAKH E-COUPONS ISSUED Delhi’s food and civil supplies department has managed to issue at least one round of ration to over 1 crore people since April, government reports showed. “The 71 lakh ration card holders have already received two rounds of free enhanced ration.

28-05-2020||Pune||Serum Institute confident of manufacturing Covid vaccine’s 100 million doses if trials establish efficacy||Serum Institute, the world largest manufacturer of vaccines by volume, has currently joined hands with various global pharmaceutical institutes and firms in efforts to produce a vaccine for Covid-19. Serum Institute’s chief executive officer (CEO) Adar Poonawalla, via email, share his views on the current status of Covid-19 and BCG vaccines.There are trials for the recombinant Bacille Calmette-Guerian (BCG) vaccine underway in Pune and other places. What is the update on this?Serum Institute of India’s (SII) recombinant BCG vaccine trials are going on in Pune at Ruby Hall, KEM Pune and Jehangir Hospital, Pune. These trials are going on in more than 30 location across the country. These are phase-3 trials to improve the innate ability to fight the virus and reduce the severity. Is there any timeframe Serum institute is looking at for the production of recombinant BCG vaccine that promises to boost human immunity against Covid-19?This is an extremely safe vaccine since it is given to new-born babies and we have been selling this in more than 100 countries worldwide for more than two decades. Based on our trials, we will be certain on the efficacy and viability of the vaccine, post which we will be able to comment on the production of the vaccine. We are already manufacturing the rBCG vaccine only for our ongoing clinical trials. On Covid-19 vaccine being developed by Oxford University, how have dynamics changed for Serum after AstraZeneca recently joined forces with the UK government to support Oxford’s vaccine?Currently, our discussion with AstraZeneca is on-going. For now, we can certainly say that if the trials are successful in establishing efficacy, we will manufacture more than 100 million doses. We can comment further once the deal is concluded and finalised.When can Serum expect to start manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccine?Since our deal with AstraZeneca is yet to be finalized, it would be difficult to comment on the exact timeline. However, we aim to produce four-five million doses a month once the deal is concluded and then gradually ramp up the production, based on the success of the trials.What is the status of Serum’s independent endeavour to develop a vaccine on COVID with USA-based firm Codagenix?At present, we are undergoing pre-clinical trials (animal trial phase) and hope to progress to the human trial phase by September/October. The aim is to make the vaccine over the next 1.5-twoyears to help combat the novel Coronavirus. With the combined efforts of our partner Codagenix, we are optimistic that we will be able to provide a viable and effective vaccine for mass use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/serum-institute-confident-of-manufacturing-covid-vaccine-s-100-million-doses-if-trials-establish-efficacy/story-MrVAw982iSC2IdxAqWt9II.html

28-05-2020||Gurugram||Woman held for extorting three men of ₹30 lakh after accusing them of rape||The police on Tuesday arrested a 28-year-old woman for attempting to extort three men, including a police officer, of ₹30 lakh, three days after accusing them of molesting and raping her and lodging an FIR against them in Palam Vihar. The police said that after lodging the FIR, the woman and her friend contacted acquaintances of two of the men, asking them to pay ₹30 lakh to withdraw the case. The police said the woman worked at a spa in DLF phase 1. They added that in 2010, she had accused another man of raping her in Rewari and later withdrawn the case after taking money from him. On Sunday, the woman had alleged that on May 23 around 5.30pm, she had received a phone call from her friend, a police constable. “He asked me to come along for a drive. Two of his friends, including one who called himself a sarpanch, were seated in the car. On the way, they started consuming liquor and stopped at a banquet hall, where they drank more alcohol. I was sitting in a room when two of them started misbehaving with me and groped me. The third person took me to a separate room and raped me,” she had stated in the complaint, adding that she was slapped and threatened. The police had registered an FIR against the three persons, including the police constable, under sections 376 D (gang rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code at the Palam Vihar police station. One of the men she accused was arrested.The police said the woman had acquainted herself with the police officer she accused when he was posted at DLF phase 1 police station. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, that during questioning, the woman revealed that on May 23, she planned the conspiracy to extort money from the police officer and his ‘sarpanch’ friend. “After she sat in the car and heard one of the men refer to himself as a sarpanch, she came up with a plan. The woman and the three men consumed liquor and went to a banquet hall, where the policeman and his friend went to sleep. The woman then had consensual sex with the third man she accused,” Boken said. The same evening, she filed a case. The police said on Tuesday that a friend of the men she accused approached the police stating that he had received a phone call from a friend of the complainant, who asked him for ₹30 lakh to withdraw the case. “The complainant also called a head constable who is a friend of the accused policeman. During the phone call, she said that she would get the FIR cancelled if he paid her ₹30 lakh. The police constable submitted the recording of the phone call as evidence,” Boken said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/woman-held-for-extorting-three-men-of-30-lakh-after-accusing-them-of-rape/story-jmvQctzfJq54zoY8nWfD0N.html
28-05-2020||Delhi||Nodal officers appointed to help in medical emergencies in Delhi containment zones||The Delhi government has released a new protocol for streamlining the process of dealing with medical emergencies in containment zones, appointing nodal officers across districts who would help in arranging ambulances and health workers, a senior government officials said on Wednesday. Delhi has 96 containment zones, according to the government health bulletin issued on Wednesday. Residents of these areas are not allowed to venture outdoors even to procure essential goods and medicines. Medical emergencies are the only exception. In the latest move, nodal officers have been appointed for all 33 subdivisions under Delhi’s 11 revenue districts. A senior government official said each nodal officer has a team and resources that include vehicles and health workers who can be availed of at the earliest in case of a health emergency. The phone numbers of the nodal officers have been distributed among residents of containment zones in the past few days. So, in case of a health emergency, they have to dial a single number for help, the official said.“In some districts, the nodal officers are monitoring the process of doorstep delivery of essentials,” said district magistrate (south) BM Mishra.Another government official said, “Initially, there were cases in which police officials or health officials deployed in the containment zones were informed about health emergency and they told their seniors before arranging an ambulance themselves. In some cases, they did have the resources. In others, they prioritised protocols over natural instinct. Ultimately, it resulted in delays.”Then there are cases when police officials have arranged vehicles on their own to tackle emergencies, said the official, adding: “The appointment of nodal officers is expected to further streamline the process.”Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicine department in Safdarjung Hospital, said: “It can be a good strategy provided that the nodal officers have access to adequate resources – from vehicles to manpower needed to attend a large number of calls and act as helping hand during emergencies. It would be even better if the government considers involving community volunteers in this process. It would get further streamlined.”GROUND STORIESOf all the current containment zones in Delhi, the oldest one happens to be Nizamuddin Basti in south-east district that was made as a no-go zone on March 30, after around 3,000 people were evacuated from the Markaz building in the vicinity. Earlier that month, the building had witnessed a religious congregation attended by thousands. The area is yet to be de-sealed. On April 26, Mohammad Yasin, a resident of Nizamuddin Basti, had to be rushed to the hospital for a sudden stomach pain that turned severe within minutes. His relatives said they tried calling an ambulance on their own but that did not work out. So, they had to take help of the police officials deployed at the nearest barricade.“My brother then took me in a car and tried to go to a hospital but the authorities stopped us at the checkpoint and asked if it was a genuine case of a medical emergency. It took a lot of time to convince them and get a nod to go out of the area,” he said.Yasin alleged that several hospitals refused to diagnose him after he disclosed his address that indicated that he lived in a containment zone. Later, he was admitted at a private hospital, he saidSalim Nizami, a resident of Nizamuddin Basti, said his daughter had labour pain in the first week of April and had to be taken to a private hospital which she regularly visited for check-ups during her pregnancy. “But the hospital admitted her after a long argument and a Covid test, while she was writhing in pain,” said Nizami, a doctor himself.Four separate district magistrates who HT spoke to said that no hospital is supposed to refuse patients from containment zones and there is a clear protocol for that issued by the Union health ministry. They, however, refused to disclose any specific case.Kishore said: “Hospitals have screening OPDs for this purpose. In case a resident of a containment zone is found to be symptomatic then the person should be tested and isolated till the test results are out, unless it is a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention. If the person tests positive later, he/she should be moved to a dedicated Covid facility and treated there. If not, they should be treated in a normal (non-Covid) ward in the hospital. Asymptomatic people should be treated immediately. Refusing to entertain patients just because they are residents of a containment zone is unethical.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/nodal-officers-appointed-to-help-in-medical-emergencies-in-delhi-containment-zones/story-lNi6h3RtWwcK1NMlOIEJ6M.html

In the alleged scuffle, he was kicked and beaten up,” the police officer said. The police said Lal sustained a groin injury and fell unconscious. He was rushed to a private hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival. The police have arrested the neighbour Sonia, who works as a housekeeper, and her 15-year-old daughter in the case. The police said the juvenile would be sent to an observation home in Karnal.A case was registered under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code at DLF phase 3 police station. In another incident, three men were arrested for allegedly murdering a 28-year-old daily wager after a drunken spat post a gambling session in Pataudi on Wednesday. The police said the victim, Bijender alias Badshah, was playing cards with Kuldeep alias Chikla, Satbir and Deepak on Tuesday evening. After Bijender won the game, the group started drinking liquor and while doing so, the victim got into a petty argument with the other men. One of the accused men, Deepak, hit him with a brick. The other two men also hit him with stones and bricks and fled. The police said his body was found near Major Market in Pataudi late Tuesday night. There were injuries on his face, suggesting that his head had been bludgeoned with a heavy object multiple times, the police said. Subhash Boken, spokesperson, city police, said, “The trio was arrested from Pataudi on Wednesday. A case of murder has been registered.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-killed-after-fight-over-overflowing-water/story-HwRtT8Tu7lI4vbrHejVVhN.html
28-05-2020||Noida||Get all property related work done online in Noida from June 1||The Noida authority has decided to discourage human interactions and get all property related work done online from June 1, officials said.The move comes after the ministry of health and family welfare has directed government bodies and other entities to follow social distancing at workplaces to contain the spread of Covid-19 infection.“All property services of Noida authority will be made fully online from June 1. No one will be allowed or required to visit office for any work related to property. The help desk at the authority office gate will facilitate uploading of documents related to the work to be done. The work will be done within a minimum of a week and a maximum of three weeks,” Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer, Noida authority, said. “Once lockdown is lifted, people can meet officer on special duty and attend predefined public meetings for grievance redressal,” Maheshwari said.The authority’s website will provide multiple property related services, including transfer of memorandum, payment of lease rent, map approval and mortgage permission among others through online platform. Transfer of memorandum is required for a flat, plot or other property when one wants to sell it. To get the document issued, one has to visit office and then start the process. Now, the website will assist the applicant to speed up the process and the work will be done in a timebound manner, officials said.“The authority was already sanctioning online the maps of individual residential houses and industrial plots measuring up to 1,000 square metres. Now, the authority will start carrying out all kinds of property related work online. It means all kinds of maps will be sanctioned online. An applicant can submit the application along with documents online and then get the work done. If any document is missing, then the portal will help the applicant to upload the same. This is a move to discourage people from coming to public offices and put themselves at risk,” another Noida authority official, requesting anonymity, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/get-all-property-related-work-done-online-in-noida-from-june-1/story-gT0yljFMEwcz7VQodcBf0H.html
28-05-2020||Noida||No cases being heard at GB Nagar consumer forum||The Gautam Budh Nagar district consumer disputes redressal forum has not been hearing any cases for two months now, ever since the forum president’s term expired on March 31. The Uttar Pradesh government had earlier issued directions stating that the district consumer disputes redressal forum should function with reduced staff during Lockdown 4.0.“Around 10 cases are being listed every day. The cause list has been prepared. These were to be taken up in two shifts. Five cases in the morning and five in afternoon. As per guidelines, only 33 percent staff is allowed to work . The staff duties were assigned accordingly. However, as the forum president’s post is vacant and we cannot conduct any hearings. In all the listed cases, only the next dates are being issued,” said Nirmala Singh, a forum member.Jagdeep Singh, an advocate with the forum said, “The forum president of Kannauj has been given additional charge of GB Nagar . But, he has only drawing and disbursing powers. This was done so that there is no problem in withdrawal of salaries for staff of the forum. He has no presiding powers and he cannot hear cases in GB Nagar. We have demanded that either he be given presiding power or another forum president be appointed so that hearing of cases starts.”The Gautam Budh Nagar district consumer forum advocates association has suggested that video conferencing hearing in consumer court cases should start on the lines of Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority(UPRERA). “Video conferencing will help complainants, advocates and forum president and members. When it can be done successfully in UPRERA, we feel it can be successful in consumer forum cases too,” said Rajinder Dhar, association representative, on Wednesday.“Further we feel that, just like RERA, single benches single member benches should hear and decide on complaints at consumer courts too. Presently, at least two members — one president and one member —are required to issue an order. Single member bench will solve the shortage of consumer forum members and chairman. More cases will be resolved, as instead of one forum bench, three single member benches will function. All this needs is an amendment to the consumer protection act,” said Dhar.Several complainants too felt video conferencing can solve a lot of problems and will be beneficial. “I have not hired an advocate and am pursuing my case myself. Video conference hearing will save time and money for me,” said Satish Sharma, one of the complainants.Mahinder Pal Singh, president Kannauj district forum, who has been given drawing and disbursal powers of Gautam Budh Nagar consumer forum, said on Wednesday, “There is shortage of members and presidents. Several consumer forum posts in the state are lying vacant. I have been looking after Kannauj, Ghaziabad and Baghpat. As there is no member, I cannot issue orders in complaints.”“Even if I start hearing cases through video conferencing orders cannot be passed as quorum of at least two members is needed. Where we have quorum, video conferencing can be done,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/no-cases-being-heard-at-gb-nagar-consumer-forum/story-wEAlX4YWZzLJ82IxVmQN3M.html
28-05-2020||City||Parents’ association protests against Punjab education minister on Facebook live||Four members of Parents’ Association, Punjab, went live on Facebook on Wednesday and raised questions to an effigy of state education minister Vijay Inder Singla for changing his statement related to collection of school fee amid the Covid-19 lockdown.They accused the minister of allowing private schools to charge tuition fee on monthly or quarterly basis from parents. The members stated that on April 10, the minister had announced that no private school will charge any fee in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. “But then on May 14, he changed the statement and allowed private schools to charge the tuition fee,” they said.Rajinder Ghai, president of the association, said, “The parents were forced to protest due to the financial constraints caused by the lockdown. People are thinking about survival at this crucial time and the private schools are sending messages to parents to submit the tuition fee and other charges.”Since May 19, this is the sixth protest in Ludhiana by parents of different associations against private schools forcing them to submit the fee.Meanwhile, another protest was held by the members of Shiv Sena, Punjab, and parents of students from various different schools outside the deputy commissioner’s (DC) office. Flouting the social distancing norms, parents and members of Shiv Sena protested for an hour, raising slogans against the schools. They also submitted a memorandum to the DC.Chairman of Shiv Sena, Punjab, Rajiv Tandon, said, “Private schools have been sending messages in the WhatsApp groups formed by teachers and highlighting the names of the students whose parents have not submitted the fee. The government should not allow the private schools to charge any fee as the schools have been closed. The government needs to intervene and take a decision to provide relief to the parents.”“Parents have been staying at home for the last two months. How will they pay the fee? If the state government fails to provide relief to the parents, then we will continue to protest,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/parents-association-protests-against-punjab-education-minister-on-facebook-live/story-x1Pw3GWwksi0Mve590P6WK.html
28-05-2020||Delhi||Draw up ‘micro plans’ to manage students when schools reopen,Delhi govt tells schools||With schools in Delhi likely to reopen by sometime in July, the Delhi government has asked principals of all state-run schools to ready “micro plans” on how to bring students back to classes, while at the same time keeping them safe from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). To that end, the government has sought a number of suggestions and information from all schools, which include drawing up a roster of online and offline classes, identifying classes whose students should come to school daily, and offering emotional support to students. The Delhi government and the NCERT have also been preparing standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the reopening of schools. Classes were suspended in Delhi on March 19 when the Covid-19 pandemic had hit the capital. The Delhi government later announced that the summer vacations will be from May 11 to June 30. The private schools in the city also announced summer break for the same period. However, online classes are still on in both government and private schools. Although the Delhi government has not announced any date for the reopening of schools in Delhi as yet, officials said a decision on this will be taken only after the pending board exams -- scheduled between July 1 and 15 -- are over. In a letter sent to the heads of Delhi government-run schools on Tuesday, the directorate of education (DoE) said that a micro plan should be ready with each school --- keeping in view the enrolment, availability of human and infrastructure resources--- for reopening whenever that may be. The plan will be prepared in consultation with the teachers, parents, and members of the school management committees (SMCs). While formulating their micro plans, the government schools were asked to brainstorm ways to bring back students while ensuring that they are properly tracked. Schools have been asked to suggest the number of students each class can accommodate while maintaining social distancing and the number of students who can attend school each day, based on the classrooms available. Schools have also been directed to inform if they need more staff to maintain proper sanitation on their premises.The DoE has also directed government schools to provide the number of students enrolled before the lockdown. “We have asked schools to provide the number of students who were in regular touch during the lockdown and what’s the penetration of smartphones/computers among them. They have also been asked to provide the number of students who could not be contacted at all. We have also sought an estimate of students who will return in case schools reopen in July. The government will chalk out its outreach plan based on these information,” a senior DoE official said.The DoE has also asked school heads to plan on how to raise resources. Schools have been asked to submit their plans with their district education directors by June 5.Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia also met with principals of over 1,000 government schools on Wednesday through video conferencing. “The reason we are following an elaborate planning process is because we need to keep many factors in mind before making a decision. It is not just about maintaining social distancing or sanitisation alone. Any decision will have far-reaching implications on children and their families because schools are an integral part of our life,” he said. “I appeal to you to lead an in-depth brainstorming at school level involving all key stakeholders and come up with a micro plan on how to lead the transition when the time comes. We cannot have a common plan to reopen for all schools this year as the context of each school is different,” Sisodia said. Several principals on Wednesday said student from nursery to class 8 shall not be called to school immediately on reopening. AK Jha, principal of Sarvodya Vidyalaya Co-Ed in Rohini, said, “These children are too young to understand social distancing norms. It’s better if they can be taught online till August or September. Classes can be resumed for classes 9 to 12 in batches.”Meanwhile, some private schools have also started drafting their SOPs. For instance, Mount Abu School has prepared its own guidelines which specify, among other things, a limiting of student strength to 33% at a time, switching off air-conditioners in classes and on buses, compulsory daily screening, apart from mandatory masks, gloves, and hand sanitisers and different recess timings for different classes. “We have prepared the SOPs based on our own requirements and will incorporate them with the guidelines issued by the NCERT and the Delhi government,” Mount Abu principal Jyoti Arora said.Amita Wattal, principal of Springdales School, Pusa Road, said her school has also prepared SOPs for reopening. “First, we are going to implement the SOPs for the board exams to be held in July. We will cordon off some areas to ensure complete sanitisation. We will also limit the number of students to two at a time in toilets. Areas such a library, labs and canteen will remain shut,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/draw-up-micro-plans-to-manage-students-when-schools-reopen-delhi-govt-tells-schools/story-b8MYG0g8dPPRGCaoMIUbiP.html
28-05-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal thanks Covid-19 warriors, salutes them for being #DilliKeHeroes||“I have told members at my home to think that our family is now of 30-35,000 people. If I go back home, thousands will spend a day hungry,” said Vijay Yadav (36), a cook in the government’s hunger relief programme, in a video shared by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday to salute the front-line workers during the pandemic. Kicking off the #DilliKeHeroes campaign with Yadav’s video, Kejriwal tweeted, “Most of us were locked in our homes during the Covid epidemic. But, some Delhiites were serving the people of the city and the country. The entire Delhi salutes these #DilliKeHeroes. I will begin sharing the stories of such heroes on social media from today.”In the video, Yadav is seen at his workstation, a school, cooking kilos of rice and daal. He then looks at the camera and talks about his daily schedule. “I work in the hunger relief centre the whole day, and can only find two hours a day for myself. When I used to work in the midday meal centre before the lockdown, the work was much less, but now, I am working for 22 hours straight. We serve 60-70 centres and cook food for around 30-35000 people. Our first phase of cooking continues from around 2am till 8am. Then the second phase starts from noon after all the supplies have reached our kitchen,” he said. For 34-year-old Asha, a nurse at LNJP Hospital, it has been a month since she has gone home. Since this is a pandemic, she said she is staying away from her family.“I stay in touch with my family and my kids through video calls. We are required to work continuous shifts for 14 days — in the morning, evening, and night. Our morning and evening shifts are for six hours and the night shift is for 12 hours. We do not have any leaves, and there will be continuous duties for 14 days and then quarantine for 14 days,” she said. Rajendra, a 27-year-old civil defence volunteer deployed at a hunger relief centre in Kalkaji has to ensure social distancing at the centre. He said he stays away from home as much as possible. Even when he visits, he prefers getting his body temperature checked before entering his home to meet his family members.Dr Ajit Jain, a cardiac surgeon at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, said it has been two months since he met his family, and that his kids start crying whenever he talks to them on the phone. “The CM held a zoom call with all of us during the lockdown and arranged the best possible stay arrangements for us in hotels, because travelling would have been a problem for us. Transport arrangements have also been made for healthcare staff to travel between hospitals and hotels,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kejriwal-salutes-dillikeheroes/story-1v5TdSm40uMQ1uLM1SIJwM.html

The investigation is still under process and we are questioning people residing near the gurdwara and other people who were in close contact with the woman.”Meanwhile, the police are also suspecting that someone may have played a prank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-clueless-about-the-person-who-threw-gutka-sahib-inside-ludhiana-gurdwara/story-neqsc0AkhD7u1p9yIQLWUN.html

Apart from hitting their business, the lockdown has also delayed the ongoing smart city projects in the respective areas. The contractor concerned has dug up the areas at different points resulting in traffic and parking woes.The projects, including Sarabha Nagar market retrofitting project and the development of Malhar Road into a smart road worth over Rs 38 crore, were inaugurated in March last year and the civil works commenced in July. The projects were to be completed by May 24, but the works came to halt after the imposition of curfew in the state on March 23.The construction work was restarted after getting permission from the district administration in the last week of April, but not in its full capacity due to the precautionary restrictions imposed by the administration.SMART CITY BODY MAY GIVE EXTENSIONWhile the Ludhiana Smart City Limited (LSCL) authorities are contemplating to grant an extension of two months for completion of the projects, the construction company officials claimed that it might take over six months to complete the work as it has been hit due to the lockdown and reverse migration of labourers. “So far, around 60% work has been completed,” they said. Sarabha Nagar Main Market Traders’ Association chairman Wangjenn Chiu said, “It is obvious that the project will miss the deadline due to the lockdown, but the authorities should expedite the work as the construction has now commenced. The project should be completed before monsoon hits, otherwise, it will again come to halt.” Shopkeepers of Malhar Road also demanded that the project for developing the road into a smart road should be completed at the earliest as it will increase the footfall in the market, which is good for business.Malhar Road Traders’ Association president Paramjit Singh said, “The business is at an all-time low with only few customers visiting the shops on amdaily basis due to the lockdown restrictions and rising mercury. Last year also, many cars and two-wheelers got stuck in the dug up area as sand poured over the area settled down during rainfall resulting into potholes.”LSCL chief executive officer Sanyam Agarwal said the contractors were facing trouble in taking up the projects amid the lockdown “as material was also not readily available.” “Two-month extension will be given to the contractor and they will be asked to complete the works at the earliest,” he said.The smart road project being taken up on Malhar Road includes establishment of a storm water sewer, cycle tracks, 24/7 water supply, underground wiring, beautification and plantation drives. Parking area will also be developed under the project. Sarabha Nagar market retrofitting project comprises electrical wiring, fire safety, beautification and development of parking area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/double-whammy-for-traders-as-ludhiana-smart-city-projects-get-delayed/story-V5eb3ipkPziXP6HEaXuXOM.html
28-05-2020||Pune||On study leave, Pune cub doctor comes home and masters the lesson of service||For Dr Charuta Shrotriya, her visit home from Kolkata has turned into a mission that is part of her profession. The 26-year-old has been volunteering for Covid-19 treatment along with her two doctor friends since March at the PMC-run Naidu Infectious Diseases Hospital.“I am working with Dr Ravisha More and Dr Aditya Lal, my 2017 batchmates of Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical College Pune. I am doing my post-graduation in Ophthalmology from Kolkata and had visited home in March for a few days and the lockdown was imposed,” said Dr Charuta.Dr Lal, who was approached by Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to set up a quarantine zone, contacted Dr Charuta and the latter agreed after convincing her concerned family.“I could not fathom sitting at home doing nothing when can of be of help. My intentions behind volunteering were just that — help out in any way I could since it was my duty as a doctor to do something because Pune was one of the cities worst-hit by Covid-19,” said Dr Charuta, while examining people at Naidu that sees a lot of patients every day. At Naidu, she works in the flu outpatient department and also visits the wards where patients are admitted. “We evaluate patients’ symptoms and decide treatment accordingly. We see 60-70 patients every day,” she said. Dr Charu said that her family were initially against her volunteering as two high-risk members, her grandparents, live in the house. “My Dad agreed and we devised a preventive measure before I started visiting the hospital. My only fear is that family should not suffer because of my decision. So far, it is going on well,” she said.She works at Naidu for nine hours, except on Sunday. “The staff her are helpful and kind-hearted, especially Dr Sudhir Patsute, the medical superintendent, and resident medical officer Dr Namrata Chandanshiv.” She said that her experience will benefit her career.“The best part of the day is when we discharge suspected patients when they test negative. The happiness on their faces is incomparable. With hospitals nearing capacity, many times patients are not admitted because there is not enough beds. I feel sad for their plight. We do our best to ensure they can be accommodated in some medical centre. Patients who are caught in this cycle of referral sometimes threaten us but we deal with them calmly. We had one deceased positive patient’s son who demanded answers and threatened to end his life. We had a patient who became violent because he didn’t want to stay admitted. Our head personally meet them and address their concerns,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-study-leave-cub-doctor-in-pune-masters-the-lesson-of-service/story-ozueY1q3dQja6J5ykgmdMN.html
28-05-2020||Pune||Video of dirty isolation centre in Pune exposes admin’s clean-up act||Sinks covered with vomit, piles of discarded clothes of discharged Covid-19 patients, lobby filled with garbage and food containers, greeted the eyes of inmates of the isolation centre at Sinhgad College Girls Hostel in Vadgaon Budruk. With 240 rooms, the hostel, as of Wednesday, caters to 450 Covid-19 patients who test positive for the Sars-Cov-2 virus and mostly live in Tadiwala road and Bhavani peth slums. One of the patients recorded a video of his ordeal at the isolation centre and uploaded the video on his social media pages. The video allegedly also shows how inmates have been made to clean the dirty corridors of the centre. Once the video was widely circulated on social media, the administration swung into action and cleared the garbage and sanitised the rooms. However, civic officials also stated that patients were the one to blame as they have been creating problems as they do not want to stay in the hostel. The patient who recorded the video is a resident of Sant Gadge Maharaj Vasahat which is close to Koregaon Park. The patient said, “We were first housed at the Kasturba Civic School, where our swabs were collected on Friday and then till Monday, we were housed there. When the results were received, the positive patients were taken to the Sinhgad College hostel, which is an isolation centre. At least 100 people were kept in the school without following any social distancing and hence, suspected positive and negative cases were all huddled together.”The patient further alleged that none of the positive patients were shown their results. “When we came here, we had only one drinking water tap for 450 patients and the sinks were stinking as they had not been cleaned, garbage and food packages were kept in the corridor. We did not get masks and we have been using the same mask since the past three days, we were not given any sanitisers and the clothes and belongings of other patients had not been discarded. We had to clean our rooms ourselves as none of the workers were ready to clean it. Once I put the video online, the sanitation workers came and cleared the centre.”Shekhar Gaikwad, Pune municipal commissioner, said, “We will have to investigate this particular case because we do provide sanitisers and masks to everyone and have placed it inside each room and at the entrance too. This could be a complaint from one person out of the thousands, who have been isolated. The masks which we provide are reusable most of the time. It can be washed and reused. However, I will inquire into these complaints.”Santosh Tandale, civic officer incharge of the centre, said, “Most of the patients are asymptomatic and would be discharged in just ten days. The patients did not want to stay here and so they are making these excuses. The garbage in the video had not been stacked for days, but were food packets from the same morning which were not cleared. We cleaned it in the evening. The sanitation staff regularly cleans the centre, but some of the patients want to be shifted to the Nicmar facility at Balewadi as some of their relatives are there, but it is full. Hence, they are raising these issues here. We have arranged for some counselling sessions to help them understand the issue and they will be discharged in ten days as most of them are asymptomatic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/after-video-of-dirty-unhygienic-isolation-centre-in-pune-goes-online-administration-swings-into-action-and-cleans-up-act/story-Zx5DZjmNStwZox66rEc5XP.html

The old flyover for vehicles had exits to Baner, Pashan and Aundh. Giving details, Kharwadkar, said, the existing flyover did not address the traffic jam issues and the difficulties faced by pedestrians at the SPPU chowk. “We are now going to make a new development plan for the new flyover of 1.5 km in which public transport and pedestrian movement will be given highest importance. The vehicular movement towards Aundh and Pashan will also be smooth,” he said.Kharwadkar said that the state government has advised that the demolition and construction of the new flyover be undertaken by Tata –Siemens.The government’s decision to demolish the flyover and construct a new one in its place was criticised by traffic and transportation activist Sujit Patwardhan, founder of the voluntary organisation, Parisar. “We have written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray about our concerns on building this new flyover,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-govt-permits-demolition-of-two-flyovers-in-pune/story-JpZ33vPEpuzoU5HxJjtwMM.html
