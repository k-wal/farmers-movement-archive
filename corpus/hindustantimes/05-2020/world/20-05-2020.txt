He has separately accused the WHO and its director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus personally of “missteps” of their own, including abetting China’s cover-up.With all 50 United States set to reopen partially President Trump stirred fresh controversy Tuesday saying he considered it a “badge of honor” that the United States had the highest number of infections in the world at 1.5 million, arguing it was a testimony to increased testing.Critics pounced on the president, arguing, he was taking credit for the highest number of infections.“So when we have a lot of cases, I don’t look at that as a bad thing; I look at that as -- in a certain respect, as being a good thing because it means our testing is much better,” he had said, “I view it as a badge of honor. Really, it’s a badge of honor.”There were 1.52 million confirmed Covid-19 cases in the United States till Wednesday morning and 91,983 fatalities, up by 20,260 and 1,574 in past 24 hours respectively. The total number of tests administered thus far was 12.6 million, according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The high number of infections is a reflection of higher testing, as the president has argued in his defence, but critics have largely attributed them, and the high fatalities, to his administration delayed and botched initial response to the outbreak, which allowed the virus to spread rapidly unchallenged.President Trump has touted testing figures in recent days to counter criticism that the United States is not testing enough, specially with states reopening steadily. Public health officials have sought more testing to ensure lifting of curbs on public life did not lead to a resurgence as it has in countries.Connecticut became Wednesday the 50th American state to join the national reopening, allowing restaurants, malls and some outdoor activities to resume. As in a number of other states, rest of the economy and public life will be reopened in phases depending, determined by declining incidence of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-calls-covid-19-outbreak-mass-worldwide-killing-slams-china-for-incompetence/story-USaB6LTcq21KZrbMHNLlpJ.html
20-05-2020||World||Moderate increase in China’s defence budget likely in Covid-hit year, say experts||China is likely to increase its soon-to-be announced 2020 defence budget moderately in the backdrop of an epidemic-hit economy but also to have adequate resources to face challenges at home and abroad, military experts said Wednesday.The Chinese finance ministry is expected to announce the outlay for the sector on the first day of the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s legislature, which begins for a delayed and short session on Friday.In March, 2019, Beijing announced a yearly budget of 1.19 trillion yuan ($177.5 billion), marking a 7.5 percent increase from the 2018 budget of 1.11 trillion yuan ($167.4 billion).Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageChina, the world’s second-largest economy, sank by a historic 6.8% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to a year earlier following a battering by the Covid-19 outbreak in the first quarter.“My personal opinion is that China’s military spending should increase moderately. The gap between China’s actual needs and the actual figures for military spending is huge, and the problems China faces are numerous and the dangers are growing,” Song Zhongping, Hong Kong-based military expert said.Among the external factors, Song highlighted China’s rising tension with the US, Taiwan’s, which China says is a breakaway region, “provocative statements”, Sino-India tension at the border and the volatile situation in the dispute ridden South China Sea.Shanghai-based military expert Ni Lexiong said many of China’s neighbours like India, Russia and Japan have joined the “arms race” in east Asia, an “…external factor that have prompted the mainland to significantly increase its military spending”.Ni, however, agreed that the government needs to maintain a balance in its defence budget – a balance between the domestic economic situation and the need for the armed forces.“Personally, I feel, the increase can’t be too much more than last year; but to increase it by less than last year, it will be suspected (by the international community) that China is weak. Therefore, a slight increase maybe a balanced move,” Ni said.“The moderate increase in China’s military spending is also in linewith the needs of our economic development; if the increase in GDP this year is 3%, 4%, I think the increase in military spending should be around 5% (more than last year),” Song said.Song added that the epidemic has also made the PLA aware of the need for increased military spending to improve its ability to respond to biological warfare.“China will not engage in an arms race no matter how much it increases its military spending. If military spending is raised to over 4% or 5% of GDP, it is called an arms race,” Song said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderate-increase-in-china-s-defence-budget-likely-in-covid-hit-year-say-experts/story-Kc5Vn65VmjaoiJ7R0uZoWO.html
20-05-2020||World||US-based firm leads Covid-19 vaccine race, clinical trials show promising early results: Experts||As scientists across the world work frantically to find a vaccine against Covid-19, which continues its rapid global spread, all eyes are on US-based company Moderna’s encouraging early results on a small group of healthy volunteers. Cautioning that a vaccine is still months, maybe even a year away, experts said the US-based biotechnology firm‘s results have propelled it to a pole position in the race of 118, say experts.Eight candidate vaccines for Covid-19 are in the clinical evaluation, while 110 are in the preclinical stage, according to the WHO’s latest draft landscape.  Preclinical development is a stage of research during which important feasibility, iterative testing and drug safety data are collected, while clinical trials are research studies performed on people.Early data from its vaccine candidate “mRNA-1273” showed it produced protective antibodies in a group of eight healthy volunteers, Moderna said.The other closely watched Covid-19 vaccine is the one being developed by scientists at Oxford University. It appears protective in a small study of six monkeys, promising findings that led to the start of human trials late last month.“Because Moderna’s is the only vaccine having demonstrated any kind of immunologic response in the Covid-19 field, we would consider this to be the leading candidate,” said Michael Breen, associate director, Infectious Disease, at GlobalData, a UK-based data analytics and consulting company. “Of the vaccines in human trials, only two have demonstrated any kind of effectiveness,” Breen told PTI, noting that the Moderna study proves that the platform can lead to the production of antibodies against a given virus.Moderna on Monday announced positive interim clinical data of mRNA-1273, from the Phase 1 study led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).The data comes from eight people who took part in a 45-subject safety trial that kicked off in March.The study showed the vaccine was safe and all study participants produced antibodies against the virus, according to the company. “Globally, one vaccine candidate that is promising is Moderna’s mRNA based vaccine that showed promising results in the early trials,” Upasana Ray, assistant professor at CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology in Kolkata, told PTI.RNA is the genetic material of the viruses. While conventional vaccines are developed with an inactivated virus or using proteins made by virus,  messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines work by introducing a synthetic sequence of the viruses’ genetic material that encodes the disease-specific protein to trigger the body’s immune system, the experts explained.Discussing the Oxford University vaccine, she said the work “deserves applause but needs additional supportive information and experiments”.The preliminary findings of the Oxford study appeared on the preprint server bioRxiv. A preprint is a full draft research paper that is shared publicly before it has been peer reviewed or published in a journal.British drug maker AstraZeneca teamed up with researchers at the Oxford Vaccine Group and the Jenner Institute in developing the vaccine.Breen described their “ChAdOx1 nCoV-19” candidate vaccine as a “standout”. “While this vaccine has yet to demonstrate efficacy in humans, it was shown to be able to prevent infection and disease from Covid-19 in a primate model,” he said. While this needs to be replicated in humans, it is one of only two vaccines to have demonstrated any effectiveness in reducing infection due to Covid-19, making it a “highly interesting candidate”.Though the Moderna and the Oxford vaccines are in a leading position, there are several other vaccines, including those being developed in India, in the running.In India, eight organisations are in the fray with a vaccine candidate , half of which are companies and the other half non-industry, said Brooke Wilson, associate director, Healthcare, GlobalData.  “These organisations are running or planning to initiate 12 clinical trials, one is ongoing, recruiting and the other 11 are planned,” Wilson told PTI.He explained that six of these trials are specifically for a Covid-19 vaccine while the other six trials use a vaccine developed for other indications, such as tuberculosis, adding that the majority of the trials are in Phase I, followed by Phase 3 and Phase 2. Explaining the various phases in the development of a vaccine, E. Sreekumar, chief scientific officer at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) in Kerala, said Phase 1 trials are small-scale, usually involving few participants, to assess whether the vaccine is safe for humans. Phase 2 trials often involve several hundred subjects, and mainly evaluate the efficacy.  “The final phase involves thousands of people to further assess the efficacy of the vaccine over a defined period of time, and can last several months, Sreekumar said.  Breen also mentioned China-based Sinovac Biotech’s PiCoVacc vaccine which he said has demonstrated efficacy in non-human primates, similar to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.However, he said Sinovac Biotech does not have the global marketing capabilities of AstraZeneca, which could impact worldwide availability of their vaccine.In another animal trial, researchers from Fudan University in China last week announced that a single dose of a  SARS-CoV-2 simulating particle vaccine induces potent neutralising activities in mice.“These results support further development of ShaCoVacc as a candidate vaccine for Covid-19,” the researchers wrote in a paper that appeared in preprint platform BioRxiv.A vaccine is designed to protect people before they’re exposed to a virus -- in this case, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 -- according to the WHO.It basically trains the immune system to recognise and attack the virus when it encounters it, the world health body noted.“Vaccine development involves many steps starting from designing the candidate, mice immunisation studies and neutralising antibody repertoire testing, other animal immunisation trials like in ferrets, human safety checks, human trials of various levels before it is approved for general use,” said Ray This entire process, she noted, takes at least 12-18 months.“However, the extent of worldwide effort been taken in this area is commendable and promising showing hope of a possible efficient vaccine in near future,’’ Ray added.Umashankar Singh, assistant professor, biological engineering, IIT-Gandhinagar told PTI that the number of different approaches employed for Covid-19 are impressive. “My personal understanding is that all of these strategies will yield results that may suit different profiles of recipients and might end up providing immunity, not exclusively though, against different strains of this virus that will emerge, if not there already,” he said. The number of Covid-19 cases is close to five million in 188 countries and region with more than 3,23,000 fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-based-firm-leads-covid-19-vaccine-race-clinical-trials-show-promising-early-results-experts/story-LzMG08tvBkNitUupa5MyRN.html
20-05-2020||World||Coronavirus coming from India ‘more lethal’ than those from China, Italy: Nepal PM||Nepal Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli has said the coronavirus coming from India is “more lethal” than those from China and Italy and blamed the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the Himalayan nation on those illegally entering the country from India, as the total number of Covid-19 cases jumped to 427 on Wednesday. Speaking about the COVID-19 pandemic in Parliament on Tuesday, Oli said it has become very difficult for Nepal to contain the spread of the deadly virus due to the flow of people from outside. “Many coronavirus infected patients have entered into Nepal. The virus came from outside, as we did not have here before. We could not stop infiltration of people from outside the border,” he said. Oli said that the biggest challenge facing the country today is the rising number of coronavirus cases and blamed the rising number of coronavirus cases on individuals breaking the nationwide lockdown, especially those sneaking into Nepal from India. “The coronavirus coming from India are more lethal than those from China and Italy,” he said. “Those who are coming from India through illegal channels are spreading the virus in the country and some local representatives and party leaders are responsible for bringing in people from India without proper testing,” Oli was quoted as saying by the Kathmandu Post. Oli’s remarks came amid Nepal’s border row with India after the construction of a key road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand. He said the Nepal government has been following precautionary measures since early time to stop the spread of the virus. “It is the main priority of the government to make the country free from coronavirus,” he said. There were reports of hundreds of people entering the country daily through different border points despite the deployment of security personnel at all major entry points along the Nepal-India border to check cross-border movement of people during the lockdown. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Oli had instructed authorities to intensify the vigil along the country’s southern border with India due to a sudden spike in the number of coronavirus patients and directed the officials to properly manage the lockdown. The nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus has been extended until June 2. The coronavirus cases in Nepal on Wednesday rose to 427 after 25 new infection cases were confirmed, the Health Ministry said. Two persons, a man and a woman, have died due to COVID-19 in the country so far. Prime Minister Oli on Tuesday asserted that Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura belong to Nepal and vowed to “reclaim” them from India through political and diplomatic efforts, as his Cabinet endorsed a new political map showing the three areas as Nepalese territory. Addressing Parliament, Oli said the territories belong to Nepal “but India has made it a disputed area by keeping its Army there”. “Nepalis were blocked from going there after India stationed its Army,” he said. The Lipulekh pass is a far western point near Kalapani, a disputed border area between Nepal and India. Both India and Nepal claim Kalapani as an integral part of their territory - India as part of Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district and Nepal as part of Dharchula district. India has said that the recently-inaugurated road section in Pithoragarh district in Uttarakhand lies completely within its territory. Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane last week said that there were reasons to believe that Nepal objected to India’s newly-inaugurated road linking Lipulekh Pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand at the behest of “someone else”, in an apparent reference to a possible role by China on the matter. He said there was no dispute whatsoever between India and Nepal in the area and road laid was very much within the Indian side.

The government wants to extend it until June 7.The vote is expected to be close, although Sánchez’s minority government composed of his Socialists and an anti-austerity party has secured the important backing of the center-right Citizens party.Sánchez’s support has been waning with every vote to extend the state of emergency, which gives the government the power to restrict Constitutional rights such as free movement and assembly key to its sanitary lockdown. The main opposition party, the conservative Popular Party, has said it will vote “No.” Also, the governmental gazette published the order that will require everyone over six years old to wear face masks in a closed public space or outdoors if a two-meter (6.5-foot) social distance cannot be guaranteed starting Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-spanish-pm-asks-to-extend-state-of-emergency-again/story-WpjyjXMTYmel96jb7FjcNL.html

Some of the masks had a red stain on them, after lab testing it was found those were paan stain.”“As per our hospital protocol, we destroyed all kits to ensure no infection gets spread in our hospital. It’s shameful that after receiving fake Made-in-China testing machine, AJK has now become a dumping ground for used PPE kits,” the Twitter thread added.The hospital was constructed with humanitarian assistance donated by Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the United Arab Emirates to alleviate the sufferings of the people of the region, who were affected from the devastating earthquake in 2005.Pakistan’s tally of coronavirus cases soared to 45,898, with 1,932 new ones reported on Wednesday.With poor testing and trained medical staff, PoK has registered 133 Covid-19 cases whereas Gilgit Baltistan has reported 556 positive cases.Earlier, the doctors in PoK held protests against the government for its failure to provide PPE kits to treat Covid-19 patients.However, many of these healthcare workers denied going to hospitals without PPE kits, which have affected the testing and treatment of suspected coronavirus patients.Islamabad has been discriminately treating PoK and Gilgit Baltistan during the outbreak, which has directly affected the lives of people in the regions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-hospitals-in-pok-get-used-ppe-kits-masks-with-paan-stains/story-R2UOAHrEM0nHZdW20CMamN.html

We are taking all possible measures that we should adopt for protecting the lives and properties of the people from the cyclone,” Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told a meeting of the National Disaster Management Council (NDMC) formed to review the preparations in facing the possible assault of the super cyclone.“Twenty lakh people have so far been evacuated to the cyclone centres as part of the prior preparation. As many as 13,241 cyclone shelter centres have already been opened to this end,” Hasina was quoted as saying by The Daily Star newspaper. The Bangladesh Army, Navy and Air Force have made preparations to tackle the super cyclone which has moved within 400km of Bangladesh’s coast and is expected to make landfall on Wednesday evening, Bdnews24.com reported. The cyclone is expected to make landfall at 6pm on Wednesday, State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Enamur Rahman was quoted as saying by the report. On Tuesday, the authorities began to move nearly 2.2 million people to storm shelters to avoid casualties. The Navy has deployed 25 ships as part of three-tier efforts to conduct emergency rescue, relief and medical operations in the immediate aftermath of the super cyclone, the report said. Two maritime patrol aircraft and two helicopters were also at the ready to conduct search operations over the Bay of Bengal and in the coastal districts, the Inter Services Public Relations Directorate (ISPR) said. The Army has prepared 18,400 packets of relief materials and formed 71 medical teams. As many as 145 disaster management teams with special equipment are also ready to be deployed at short notice, the ISPR said. The Army Aviation Group would join rescue and relief operations, it said. The Air Force will assess the possible damage along with medical, relief and rescue efforts by using six transport aircraft and 22 helicopters, it said. Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department on Wednesday advised ten coastal districts to hoist the ‘Great Danger Signal Number 10’ as Cyclone Amphan has moved closer to Bangladesh’s coast, the Dhaka Tribune reported. Coastal districts of Satkhira, Khulna, Bagherhat, Jhalokathi, Pirozpur, Barguna, Patuakhali, Bhola, Barishal, Laxmipur, Chandpur and their offshore islands and chars will come under great danger signal number 10, the report said. The meteorologists said the world’s largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, was likely to absorb the main brunt of the Amphan onslaughts as it has done many times over the centuries, leading to a less number of human casualties. “The Sundarbans always absorbed the brunt of cyclones whichever hit the coastlines alongside the Bangladesh-India, we expect the forest to face the initial impact of Amphan like foot soldiers this time as well,” Bangladesh’s Meteorology Department Director Shamsuddin Ahmed told reporters on Tuesday. Leading global storm tracker AccuWeather on Tuesday described Amphan as the first super cyclone in the Bay of Bengal since 1999, fearing the “ferocious” storm to unleash extreme impacts across Bangladeshi and northeastern Indian coastlines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cyclone-amphan-bangladesh-shifts-over-two-million-people-armed-forces-put-on-alert/story-cR9w1cyKuGJFWzv1tJ9zfO.html
20-05-2020||World||Russia reports record high daily coronavirus death toll with over 300,000 cases||Russia’s coronavirus case tally, the second highest in the world, passed 300,000 on Wednesday, but a representative from the World Health Organisation (WHO) said the situation was starting to stabilise. Russia’s 8,764 new novel coronavirus infections took the nationwide total to 308,705. But the daily increase was the lowest since May 1.Only the United States has reported more cases than Russia, though the Russian death rate remains much lower than many other countries, something that has been queried by some critics and relatives of those who have died. Russia says the way it counts deaths is more accurate than others however and has defended its approach. The overall death toll edged up to 2,972 on Wednesday, with 135 new fatalities reported in the past 24 hours, the country’s coronavirus response centre said. Dr. Melita Vujnovich, the WHO’s Russia representative, said on Wednesday that she believed the situation had entered a stabilisation phase, the TASS news agency cited her as saying. In Moscow, Russia’s worst hit-region now in its eighth week of a lockdown, citizens remain largely confined to their homes unless they obtain digital passes to make certain journeys. Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Tuesday it was too soon to consider letting people out for walks or exercise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-reports-record-high-daily-coronavirus-death-toll-with-over-300-000-cases/story-uQup8cJklvZzCijgLZdSvK.html
20-05-2020||World||China’s new outbreak shows signs Covid-19 could be changing||Chinese doctors are seeing the coronavirus manifest differently among patients in its new cluster of cases in the northeast region compared to the original outbreak in Wuhan, suggesting that the pathogen may be changing in unknown ways and complicating efforts to stamp it out.Patients found in the northern provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang appear to carry the virus for a longer period of time and take longer to test negative, Qiu Haibo, one of China’s top critical care doctors, told state television on Tuesday.Patients in the northeast also appear to be taking longer than the one to two weeks observed in Wuhan to develop symptoms after infection, and this delayed onset is making it harder for authorities to catch cases before they spread, said Qiu, who is now in the northern region treating patients.“The longer period during which infected patients show no symptoms has created clusters of family infections,” said Qiu, who was earlier sent to Wuhan to help in the original outbreak. Some 46 cases have been reported over the past two weeks spread across three cities -- Shulan, Jilin city and Shengyang -- in two provinces, a resurgence of infection that sparked renewed lockdown measures over a region of 100 million people.Scientists still do not fully understand if the virus is changing in significant ways and the differences Chinese doctors are seeing could be due to the fact that they’re able to observe patients more thoroughly and from an earlier stage than in Wuhan. When the outbreak first exploded in the central Chinese city, the local health-care system was so overwhelmed that only the most serious cases were being treated. The northeast cluster is also far smaller than Hubei’s outbreak, which ultimately sickened over 68,000 people.Still, the findings suggest that the remaining uncertainty over how the virus manifests will hinder governments’ efforts to curb its spread and re-open their battered economies. China has one of the most comprehensive virus detection and testing regimes globally and yet is still struggling to contain its new cluster.Researchers worldwide are trying to ascertain if the virus is mutating in a significant way to become more contagious as it races through the human population, but early research suggesting this possibility has been criticized for being overblown.“In theory, some changes in the genetic structure can lead to changes in the virus structure or how the virus behaves,” said Keiji Fukuda, director and clinical professor at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health. “However, many mutations lead to no discernible changes at all.”It’s likely that the observations in China don’t have a simple correlation with a mutation and “very clear evidence” is needed before concluding that the virus is mutating, he said.Northeast DifferencesQiu said that doctors have also noticed patients in the northeast cluster seem to have damage mostly in their lungs, whereas patients in Wuhan suffered multi-organ damage across the heart, kidney and gut.Officials now believe that the new cluster stemmed from contact with infected arrivals from Russia, which has one of the worst outbreaks in Europe. Genetic sequencing has showed a match between the northeast cases and Russian-linked ones, said Qiu.Among the northeast cluster, only 10% have turned critical and 26 are hospitalized.Over 100 Million in China’s Northeast Face Renewed LockdownChina is moving aggressively to stem the spread of the new cluster ahead of its annual political gathering in Beijing scheduled to start this week. As thousands of delegates stream into the capital to endorse the government’s agenda, China’s central leadership is determined to project stability and control.The northeast provinces have ordered a return of lockdown measures, halting train services, closing schools and sealing off residential compounds, dismaying residents who had thought the worst was over.“People should not assume the peak has passed or let down their guard,” Wu Anhua, a senior infectious disease doctor, said on state television on Tuesday. “It’s totally possible that the epidemic will last for a long time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-new-outbreak-shows-signs-covid-19-could-be-changing/story-6TDK0KB47wR9XeHqWOHrRO.html
20-05-2020||World||UK inflation slumps to lowest since 2016 as coronavirus hits||Britain’s inflation rate sank in April to its lowest since August 2016 as the coronavirus pandemic pushed down global oil prices and clothing stores slashed prices, bolstering the prospect of more Bank of England stimulus next month.Consumer price inflation dropped to an annual rate of 0.8 per cent from 1.5 per cent in March, official data showed on Wednesday. That was the sharpest one-month fall in over a decade and took inflation further below the BoE’s 2 per cent target. Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent has said it could drop below zero by the end of 2020.The BoE increased its bond-buying programme by a record 200 billion pounds in March as the per cent crisis escalated, and many economists expect another increase on June 18.Markets see a chance the BoE could cut interest rates below zero for the first time by the end of the year.Ruth Gregory, an economist with Capital Economics, said underlying price growth would stay subdued as weak demand more than offset any inflationary impact from the pandemic. “Against this background, we expect the Bank to expand its quantitative easing programme further,” she said.The Office for National Statistics says inflation readings were likely to be volatile because the coronavirus shutdown has kept its price-checkers from getting prices on more than a fifth of goods and services, forcing the ONS to estimate them or use substitutes.Declining prices for energy bills, transport - which includes petrol - and clothing and footwear, causing biggest drop in inflation.The ONS said clothing retailers, hit by the government’s stay-at-home orders, resorted to more discount sales and prices dropped by the most since 2010, down an annual 2.9 per cent.Household utility bills dropped by the most since 2009, reflecting previously announced price caps.But there was upward pressure from the price of video games and consoles, board games and children’s toys, as well as fresh vegetables, the ONS said.Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, held broadly steady at an annual rate of 1.5 per cent.Retail price inflation - an older measure which the ONS says is inaccurate, but is widely used in bond markets and for other commercial contracts - dropped to 1.5 per cent from 2.6 per cent.The dip in the CPI below 1 per cent will require BoE Governor Andrew Bailey to explain to the government how the central bank will attempt to push it back up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-inflation-slumps-to-lowest-since-2016-as-coronavirus-hits/story-dKFz4vli2h31eEmK7OGZqO.html
20-05-2020||World||Eid-ul-Fitr amid Covid-19 crisis: What countries have announced so far||The Islamic holy month of Ramadan is nearing an end amid the coronavirus crisis. Scores of countries, including India, are under lockdown to curb the rising incidence of Covid-19 infections. Last month, during the commencement of Ramadan, governments across the globe and Islamic leaders had urged the Muslim community to offer prayers from home and not to congregate amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Mosques bore a deserted look in the absence of devotees owing to the global outbreak of coronavirus. With Eid-ul-Fitr celebration just around the corner, Islamic leaders have urged people to stay indoors and avoid large gatherings on the occasion of Eid. Also read: Timing, date of Eid and impact of coronavirusEarlier this week, Darul Uloom Deoband, India’s leading Islamic seminary, issued a fatwa urging Muslims to offer their Eid prayers at home instead of congregating at mosques. The fatwa said the Eid namaz can be offered in the same manner that the Friday prayers are now being read at home.The Muslim Council of Britain also issued a similar directive asking people to celebrate Eid virtually keeping the prevailing coronavirus situation in mind.Islamic and Gulf nations like Saudia Arabia have extended lockdown for the period of Eid holidays keeping the rising number of coronavirus cases in view.Egypt has said it will bring forward the start of its curfew by four hours to 5 pm and halt public transport from May 24 for six days during the Eid holiday.Shops, restaurants, parks and beaches will be closed for the extended holiday at the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Restrictions on citizens’ movements will remain in place for at least two weeks afterwards, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said on Sunday.Saudi Arabia too has introduced a nationwide 24-hour curfew during the Eid holidays amid the coronavirus crisis. The curfew will apply from May 23 to May 27.In Jordan, there will be restrictions of movement of vehicles on the first day of Eid. The curfew will now begin at 8 pm, instead of 10 pm, and will last till 6 am. On Monday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said a four-day lockdown, starting May 23, would be imposed nationwide, to prevent the spread of coronavirus during the Eid holidays.The month of Ramazan is the holiest of the year as per the Islamic tradition and lasts for around 28 to 30 days depending on the sighting of the moon. The month-long fasting or Sawm (fasting from dawn till dusk) is one of the five pillars of Islam and is observed by Muslims across the world during Ramadan. The day starts with partaking a meal at the crack of dawn and ends by breaking the fast after sunset and saying the evening prayer Magrib.

20-05-2020||World||Annie Glenn, widow of astronaut and US senator John Glenn, dies at 100||Annie Glenn, the widow of astronaut and US Senator John Glenn and a communication disorders advocate, died Tuesday of complications from Covid-19. She was 100.Glenn died at a nursing home near St Paul, Minnesota, said Hank Wilson, a spokesman for the Glenn College of Public Affairs at The Ohio State University.At the time of John Glenn’s death in 2016, the two had been married 73 years. She had moved out of the apartment they shared in Columbus in recent years and gone to live with her daughter, Lyn, according to Wilson.Annie Glenn was thrust into the spotlight in 1962, when her husband became the first American to orbit Earth. She shied away from the media attention because of a severe stutter.Later, she underwent an intensive programme at the Communications Research Institute at Hollins College, now Hollins University, in Roanoke, Virginia, that gave her the skills to control her stutter and to speak in public.By the time 77-year-old John Glenn returned to space in 1998 aboard space shuttle Discovery, Annie showed she had become comfortable in her public role when she acknowledged that she had reservations about the retired senator’s second flight.“John had announced one year before that he was going to retire as a senator, so I was looking forward to having him as my own because I had given him to our government for 55 years,” she told a NASA interviewer.Her career in advocacy for those with communication disorders included service on the advisory boards of numerous child abuse and speech and hearing organisations. The Annie Glenn Award was created to honour individuals who overcome a communication disorder.Defense Secretary William Cohen honoured Annie Glenn with the Department of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service in 1998. He called her “a hero in her own right” and praised her for being “a strong voice for children, speech and communications, and the disabled.” In 2009, Glenn received an honorary doctorate of public service from Ohio State, where she served as an adjunct professor of speech pathology in the Department of Speech and Hearing Science. The department bestows an Annie Glenn Leadership Award annually.Glenn was born Anna Margaret Castor on February 17, 1920, in Columbus. She met her husband while they were children growing up in New Concord. She was offered an organ scholarship to The Julliard School, but World War II began and John proposed — so she decided to stay with him, according to a biography on the Glenn College’s website. The high school sweethearts attended Muskingum College and were married in 1943. They had two children, David and Lyn.The Glenns served on the board of trustees of the college, now Muskingum University, and Annie Glenn was named a distinguished alumni fellow in speech communications at the school.A virtual memorial service will be held on Saturday, June 6, 2020, at 11 am EDT. The service will be officiated by the Rev. Amy Miracle, pastor for the Broad Street Presbyterian Church in Columbus. The memorial will be virtual with no parishioners or guests in attendance due to the Covid-19 restrictions.She is survived by her two children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/annie-glenn-widow-of-astronaut-and-us-senator-john-glenn-dies-at-100/story-8umlcqYtLrYbizimrFtHYN.html

We will not accept the Beijing authorities’ use of ‘one country, two systems’ to downgrade Taiwan and undermine the cross-strait status quo. We stand fast by this principle,” Tsai said.China uses the “one country, two systems” policy, which is supposed to guarantee a high degree of autonomy, to run the former British colony of Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997. It has offered it to Taiwan, though all major Taiwanese parties have rejected it.China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, responding to Tsai, said Beijing would stick to “one country, two systems” - a central tenet of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Taiwan policy - and “not leave any space for Taiwan independence separatist activities”.“Reunification is a historical inevitability of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” it said. “We have the firm will, full confidence, and sufficient ability to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”China views Tsai as a separatist bent on formal independence for Taiwan. Tsai says Taiwan is an independent state called the Republic of China, its official name, and does not want to be part of the People’s Republic of China governed by Beijing.TAIWAN OPEN TO DIALOGUEChina has stepped up its military drills near Taiwan since Tsai’s re-election, flying fighter jets into the island’s air space and sailing warships around Taiwan.Tsai said Taiwan has made the greatest effort to maintain peace and stability in the narrow Taiwan Strait that separates the democratic island from its autocratic neighbour China.“We will continue these efforts, and we are willing to engage in dialogue with China and make more concrete contributions to regional security,” she added, speaking in the garden of the old Japanese governor’s house in Taipei, in front of a socially-distanced audience of officials and diplomats.Taiwan has become a rising source of friction between China and the United States, with the Trump administration strongly backing Taiwan even in the absence of formal diplomatic ties. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sent his congratulations to Tsai on Tuesday, praising her “courage and vision in leading Taiwan’s vibrant democracy”, in a rare high-level message from Washington direct to Taiwan’s government.China’s Foreign Ministry condemned Pompeo’s remarks, and said the government would take “necessary countermeasures”, though did not elaborate.China cut off a formal talks mechanism with Taiwan in 2016 after Tsai first won election.Yao Chia-wen, a senior adviser to Tsai, told Reuters the chance of talks with China were small given ongoing tensions.“We are ready to engage with them any time, but China is unlikely to make concessions to Taiwan,” he said. “In the next four years there’s little chance for the cross-strait relationship to improve.” (Reporting by Yimou Lee and Ben Blanchard; Additional reporting by Huizhong Wu in Beijing; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Michael Perry)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/won-t-tolerate-taiwan-s-freedom-says-china-tsai-bats-for-coexistence/story-YQWSzPdJzF8OhwXR1gM8bO.html

While the US has carefully crafted interactions with Taipei to avoid recognizing its government, Pompeo’s statement Tuesday referred to Tsai as president and called Taiwan a “force for good in the world and a reliable partner.”“China urges the US side to immediately correct its mistakes,” the ministry said in a statement posted on its website Wednesday. “The Chinese side will take necessary countermeasures to respond to the above-mentioned erroneous actions by the US side. And the US side should bear the consequences arising therefrom.”Congratulations to Dr. Tsai Ing-wen on the commencement of your second-term as Taiwan’s President. Taiwan’s vibrant democracy is an inspiration to the region and the world. With President Tsai at the helm, our partnership with Taiwan will continue to flourish.Earlier in the day, Tsai urged China to “find a way to co-exist” with Taiwan’s democratic government as she was sworn in to her second term in Taipei.

20-05-2020||World||Global emissions cut during lockdown may not last long, warn scientists||The momentous decline in global greenhouse gas emissions, fuelled by the wave of shutdowns and shuttered economies caused by the coronavirus pandemic, is unlikely to last long, said a group of scientists, who fear that the drivers of global warming could quickly bounce back as social distancing ends and economies rebound.The Washington Post on Tuesday reported that as infections surged in March and April, countries across the world experienced an abrupt reduction in driving, flying and industrial output, leading to a startling decline of more than 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions.That includes a peak drop in daily emissions of 17 per cent in early April, according to the study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change. For some nations, the falloff was much steeper.Scientists have long insisted that the world must scale back carbon pollution significantly -- and quickly -- to mitigate the worst effects of climate change over the coming decades.Tuesday’s study projects that total emissions for 2020 will probably fall between 4 and 7 per cent compared with last year. The final 2020 figure will depend on how rapidly or cautiously, people around the world resume ordinary life, the scientists said.The unprecedented situation produced by coronavirus has offered a glimpse at the massive cuts in global emissions, year after year, that would be required to meet the most ambitious goals set by world leaders when they forged the 2015 Paris climate accord.Last fall, a United Nations report estimated that global greenhouse gas emissions must begin falling by 7.6 per cent each year beginning in 2020 to avoid the worst effects of climate change.But the changes are unlikely to last.“History suggests this will be a blip,” said Rob Jackson, a Stanford University professor and one of the authors of the peer-reviewed study, which attempts to assess the virus’s effect by nation and economic sector.“The 2008 (financial) crisis decreased global emissions by 1.5 per cent for one year, and they shot back up 5 per cent in 2010. It was like it never happened,” he added.Already, the demand for energy is resuming as people return to the roads and many US states have begun easing stay-at-home orders that helped drive the price per gallon of gasoline to less than USD 1 at some pumps.Governments also are expected to begin trying to boost their economies with stimulus spending in the coming months. But how leaders decide to spend that money could make a fundamental difference.Some world leaders have also pledged to push for greener economies in the wake of the pandemic.Last week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that his country’s effort to slash its emissions remains “undiminished” by the coronavirus and the economic turmoil it has caused. He singled out airlines during remarks in the Parliament, saying the sector must limit its carbon emissions even when normal flights resume.Last month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel indicated that she would support green investments as her nation seeks to restore its economy.Although some aspects of life may change in the wake of the pandemic -- more people working remotely, fewer people commuting and taking frequent plane trips -- individual changes are unlikely to make much of a long-term mark on emissions, said Zeke Hausfather, a scientist and director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute.“Unless anything structurally changes, we can expect emissions to go back to where they were before this whole thing happened,” he was quoted as saying.Hausfather also said that one year of sharp reductions in emissions would do little to stave off the warming that scientists have said will continue unless the world significantly cuts emissions for good.“I do not think there is much of a silver lining to COVID-19 for the climate. unless we use the recovery as a chance to both stimulate the economy and build the type of infrastructure to support a clean-energy future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-emissions-cut-during-lockdown-may-not-last-long-warn-scientists/story-m11eT6KDEaeC63sQUU9IdI.html
20-05-2020||World||Man sentenced to death in Singapore via Zoom call||A man has been sentenced to death in Singapore via a Zoom video-call for his role in a drug deal, the city-state’s first case where capital punishment has been delivered remotely.Punithan Genasan, a 37-year-old Malaysian, received the sentence for his role in a 2011 heroin transaction on Friday, court documents showed, with the country under lockdown to try and curb one of the highest coronavirus rates in Asia. “For the safety of all involved in the proceedings, the hearing for Public Prosecutor v Punithan A/L Genasan was conducted by video-conferencing,” a spokesperson for Singapore’s Supreme Court said in response to Reuters’ questions, citing restrictions imposed to minimise virus spread. It was the first criminal case where a death sentence was pronounced by remote hearing in Singapore, the spokesperson added. Genasan’s lawyer, Peter Fernando, said his client received the judge’s verdict on a Zoom call and is considering an appeal.While rights groups have criticised the use of Zoom in capital cases, Fernando said he did not object to the use of video-conferencing for Friday’s call since it was only to receive the judge’s verdict, which could be heard clearly, and no other legal arguments were presented.    California-based tech firm Zoom did not immediately respond to a request for comment made via its representatives in Singapore. The Attorney General’s Chambers, the public prosecutor, referred Reuters’ questions to the Supreme Court.Many court hearings in Singapore have been adjourned during a lockdown period that started in early April and is due to run until June 1, while cases deemed essential have been held remotely. Singapore has a zero-tolerance policy for illegal drugs and has hanged hundreds of people - including dozens of foreigners - for narcotics offences over past decades, rights groups say.“Singapore’s use of the death penalty is inherently cruel and inhumane, and the use of remote technology like Zoom to sentence a man to death makes it even more so,” said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. HRW has also criticised a similar case in Nigeria where a death sentence was delivered via Zoom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-sentenced-to-death-in-singapore-via-zoom-call/story-ylk1ogjDwmOiumy5CFHopI.html

The pandemic has killed at least 17,971 people in Brazil, according to the Health Ministry.Brazil overtook Britain on Monday to become the country with the third-highest number of confirmed infections, behind Russia and the United States. Brazil’s confirmed cases also jumped by a record 17,408 on Tuesday, for a total of 271,628 people who have tested positive for the virus. Bolsonaro, an ideological ally of Trump, has been criticized for his handling of the outbreak, such as opposition to restrictions on movement he sees as too damaging to the economy.Bolsonaro said Interim Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello would issue new guidelines on Wednesday expanding the recommended use of the anti-malarial drug chloroquine to treat the coronavirus.Two trained doctors have resigned as Health Minister in the past month as Bolsonaro defies public health expert advice.Bolsonaro told website Blog do Magno that Pazuello, an active-duty army general, would sign the new chloroquine guidelines and keep the top job for now. Bolsonaro added that his mother is 93 years old, and he keeps a box of chloroquine on hand should she need it. Trump, who announced on Monday he was taking chloroquine preventively, told reporters on Tuesday: “I don’t want people coming over here and infecting our people. I don’t want people over there sick either. We’re helping Brazil with ventilators ... Brazil is having some trouble, no question about it.”Pan American Health Organization officials said in a virtual briefing they were concerned about the virus’ spread in the tri-border area of the Amazon between Colombia, Peru and Brazil. They urged special measures to protect vulnerable populations among the indigenous, poor and racial minorities.

20-05-2020||World||Trump administration signs up new company to make Covid-19 drugs in US||US President Donald Trump’s administration awarded a contract worth up to $812 million for a new US company to manufacture drugs and drug ingredients to fight Covid-19 on American soil, aiming to end dependence on other countries.The administration has been looking to build up the ability to produce drugs and their raw materials in the United States after the global pandemic exposed the industry’s dependence on China and India for its supply chain.“For far too long, we’ve relied on foreign manufacturing and supply chains for our most important medicines and active pharmaceutical ingredients while placing America’s health, safety, and national security at grave risk,” Peter Navarro, director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, said in a statement.Navarro for months has been advocating that Trump issue an executive order to require federal agencies to buy US-made medical supplies and pharmaceuticals.The U.S Department of Health and Human Services said it had awarded a four-year, $354 million contract to privately-held Phlow Corp to make Covid-19 drugs, other essential drugs and their ingredients. The contract - which is for generic drugs, not more complicated products like vaccines - can be extended to a total of $812 million over 10 years.Phlow, which was incorporated in January, said the contract will help it contribute to a national stockpile of pharmaceutical ingredients for essential medicines.The company is run by Eric Edwards, who previously founded the drug company Kaleo Pharmaceuticals with his twin brother. He said in an interview that Phlow initially reached out to the US health department last November, to tell them that they were working to build US drug manufacturing capacity.After Covid-19 hit, Edwards said Phlow focused on drugs for the virus and reached out to Navarro’s office and government agencies. “We said, ‘You’re going to have a problem.’ The supply chain was already vulnerable, with all of these drug shortages before Covid-19,” he said. The company submitted a proposal on drug manufacturing in response to an open request from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, one of the HHS agencies overseeing Covid-19 vaccine and drug development, he said.Phlow has already started making pharmaceutical ingredients and finished dosage forms for over a dozen medicines to treat hospitalized patients with Covid-19-related illnesses, including medicines for pain management, sedation for ventilators, blood pressure support for critical patients and antibiotics.All pharmaceutical products will be made in the United States, according to Phlow’s website. The company said it is working to build advanced manufacturing capability in Virginia, as well as sterile manufacturing facilities for injectables.It has partnered with generic drug manufacturer Civica Rx, chemical company Ampac Fine Chemicals and Virginia Commonwealth University’s Medicines for All Institute. It said it has already delivered over 1.6 million doses of five essential generic medicines to treat Covid-19 patients to the US Strategic National Stockpile. Edwards’ previous company Kaleo was criticized for high prices, including a $4,500 price tag on Evzio, its device to treat painkiller overdoses. Kaleo lowered the price for federal and state government agencies as well as patients without government or commercial insuranceA Phlow spokesman said Edwards never had any control over drug pricing during his tenure at Kaleo and is committed to providing low-cost generic drugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-signs-up-new-company-to-make-covid-19-drugs-in-us/story-lAKbBz1fFeNOqRILeyXUQO.html

Radisson hotels and food producer PRFoods are among the first companies that have started to test the passport.“We are seeking every solution to have our employees back to work and clients sleeping in our hotels again,” said Kaido Ojaperv, CEO of Radisson Blu Sky Hotel at Tallinn.Estonia, which has so far recorded 64 deaths due to COVID-19 and 1,791 infections, has started to ease the lockdown measures this month, and opened last week with Lithuania and Latvia the first “travel bubble” within the European Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/estonia-starts-testing-digital-immunity-passport-for-workplaces/story-vlMAVm2Ld0OcTLxh0MZiqJ.html
20-05-2020||World||Canada’s first: Teen INCEL who killed a woman charged with terrorism||Canadian law enforcement has levelled terrorism charges against a teenager who belonged the burgeoning INCEL, or involuntary celibate, movement and was allegedly involved in the murder of a woman in Toronto this February.This is a precedent setting action and the first time ever that a killing or violence related to INCELs has been formally described as terrorism. Experts believe that this action will help broaden the application of terrorism charges in other instance that are motived by ideology.The 17-year-old charged with terrorism has not been named since he is a minor. In a rampage on February 24, the youth allegedly murdered 24-year-old Ashley Noell Arzaga at the Crown Spa in the city, while also injuring two others. The charges laid against him now are defined as first-degree murder - terrorist activity and attempted murder.“Terrorism comes in many forms and it’s important to note that it is not restricted to any particular group, religion or ideology,” the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Toronto Police said in a joint statement. They added that the attack was “inspired by the Ideologically Motivated Violent Extremist (IMVE) movement commonly known as INCEL”.Canadian national broadcaster CBC described the INCELs as a “misogynistic online movement” where participants “typically express frustration toward women over their own lack of sexual success, and sometimes threaten violence against them”.Violence related to INCELs has increased in recent years. In 2018, Alex Minassian, also inspired by INCEL, used his van to run over and kill 10 people. Sixteen others were injured in the incident.Minassian, 25, declared himself to be a soldier in the “INCEL” rebellion. He was charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder.Canadian authorities had said that the majority of the victims were women, ranging in age from their mid-20s to early 80s.The outlet Global News noted that such attacks have happened in Florida in November 2018 and Texas in June last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-first-teen-incel-who-killed-a-woman-charged-with-terrorism/story-ZuqyHhBIoyM4bQssw5KXAL.html

20-05-2020||World||South Korea restarts schools after coronavirus spread slows||After an unprecedented five-month break, South Korean students are returning to their classrooms as government health officials declared that the country may have avoided a “second wave” of infections.The schools are reopening in stages, with high school seniors returning first on Wednesday and middle and elementary students slated to go back to school in the following weeks. The third-year high school students are leading the return as they now only have half a year before their annual university entrance exams in early December, education officials said.Unlike in the US, South Korea’s academic year starts in March, but students never returned to school after their winter break as the Asian nation confirmed its first Covid-19 infection in late January and then saw a spike in cases -- peaking at near 1,000 a day -- in February. Resumption of schools were delayed five times, and in April, all students were offered online classes instead.Health and education officials had worried that a new cluster infections linked to nightclubs in Seoul earlier this month could once again jeopardize plans to reopen schools, but they concluded the latest outbreak appears under control.Big EffortSouth Korea has been able to sharply slow coronavirus infections by launching a massive testing and contact tracing campaign. Thirteen new cases were reported Tuesday, raising the total to 11,078.“There are still worries over safety of our students, but the situation of the community spread is within the capacity of our health care system,” Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said before a meeting Tuesday. “If we, the government, school and families, act together, we could restart the off-line classes safely.”South Korea’s government left detailed academic schedules and methodology for each age group to be decided by respective regional authorities. But most students in Seoul -- representing more than 15% of all school-age children in the country -- will not go to school every day, except for those in their final academic year, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education.Depending on the school district, schools will start on different days and students will alternate between attending classes and online instructions at home. Class times and lunch hours are also being staggered. No extracurricular activities will be allowed.Education officials said that a school would be shuttered immediately if an infection is confirmed among the school’s students, faculty and staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-restarts-schools-after-coronavirus-spread-slows/story-jNjGS91Zye8ZfoRkUIvTXP.html
20-05-2020||World||Taiwan’s Tsai Ing-wen riding high into second term as Trump fights China||This might be as good as it gets for Tsai Ing-wen.Tsai is riding high as she starts to her second term as Taiwan’s president Wednesday in Taipei. Besides a record approval rating and a so-far successful effort to contain the coronavirus outbreak, Tsai has benefited from an upswing of support from the US and its allies.The next four years could be more challenging for Tsai, 63, as the democratically ruled island finds itself at the center of an increasingly fraught relationship between its giant neighbor China and the US. Taiwan’s export-dependent economy also faces the risk of its first recession in more than a decade as overseas demand collapses.Tsai is slated to lay out her agenda for give a speech at 10 a.m. local time after an inauguration ceremony pared down to prevent another coronavirus surge. She’ll pledge to build core industries including 5G and other information and communication technologies, bio-technology, medicine, defense and renewable energy, the Taipei-based Liberty Times reported Wednesday, without saying where it got the information. She’s also expected to maintain her opposition to unification with China, stressing democracy and dialogue in dealing with Beijing.“Taiwan’s relationship with the US will continue to warm up as the US-China relationship continues to break down,” Stephen Tan, president of the Taipei-based Cross-Strait Policy Association, said via telephone. “As long as the US-China relationship remains tense, cross-strait ties won’t improve. All Taiwan can do, and Tsai is expected to do, is to avoid being provocative and changing the status quo, but also not giving in.”High PointThe event marks another historic high point for Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party, which has grown over the past four decades from a loose band of pro-independence dissidents to become Taiwan’s dominant political bloc. A landslide election victory in January reaffirmed the DPP’s control of the executive and legislative branches and left the Kuomintang -- who ruled Taiwan for much of the time since the Chinese civil war ended in 1949 -- stuck in the opposition.Tsai begins her second term with an approval rating of 61%, the highest since she took office in May 2016, according to a survey by broadcaster TVBS released Monday.The DPP’s rise has upended efforts to by Chinese President Xi Jinping to use his country’s economic might to draw Taiwan toward a unification deal. Tsai, who views Taiwan as a sovereign nation, was expected to repeat her rejection of Xi’s bottom line that both sides belong to “one-China.”“Beijing has given up on hoping for demonstrations of ‘sincerity’ from Tsai -- partly because they set the bar too high and partly because they don’t believe she is sincere anyway,” said Jonathan Sullivan, director of China programs at the University of Nottingham. “None of the moderation that Tsai has shown has been good enough to negate the preordained opinion in Beijing that she is an independence wolf in status-quo sheep’s clothing.”In her first term, Tsai repeatedly benefited from Donald Trump’s feuding with China, holding an unprecedented phone call with the US president in December 2016 and securing Taiwan’s first American fighter jet deal in three decades. Tsai’s support for pro-democracy protests in the former British colony of Hong Kong last year helped her consolidate her China-skeptic base and secure re-election.The Trump administration threw its weigh behind an international campaign to grant Taiwan access to the World Health Assembly earlier this week. And while the attempt ultimately failed, it highlighted the lengths to which the US was willing to go to back a greater international role for Taiwan.Since Tsai came into office in 2016, Beijing has persuaded seven former Taiwanese allies to switch ties to the People’s Republic of China. Taiwan is now officially recognized by just 15 countries, mostly small states in Latin America and the Pacific. Tsai has also made little progress in securing a bilateral trade deal with the USUS Secretary of State Michael Pompeo congratulated Tsai in a statement Tuesday, saying America “has long considered Taiwan a force for good in the world and a reliable partner.” The two sides “have a shared vision for the region -- one that includes rule of law, transparency, prosperity and security for all,” he said.Higher StakesThe stakes for Tsai could rise in her second term, as disputes between Washington and Beijing prompt predictions that the two sides are headed toward a new cold war. While Tsai had so far avoided any moves that might prompt an aggressive response by Beijing, she may face greater demands from the DPP’s pro-independence wing after its recent electoral success.One figure to watch is Tsai’s incoming vice president, Lai Ching-te. Lai, a former premier who has described himself as an “independence worker,” is a much more outspoken advocate for a formal break from China than either Tsai or his predecessor, Vice President Chen Chien-jen.Tsai’s speech comes just two days before Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is scheduled to deliver his annual report to the National People’s Congress in Beijing, a platform that Chinese leaders have often used to deliver pointed message to Taiwan. Last year, Li vowed that China would “resolutely oppose and deter any separatist schemes or activities seeking Taiwanese independence.”“Beijing will continue to employ a mix of its carrots and sticks approach with Taiwan, but with an emphasis on the latter,” said Russell Hsiao, executive director of the Washington-based Global Taiwan Institute. “Indeed, most indicators point to China ratcheting up its multifaceted pressure campaign against Taiwan.”Although Taiwan has avoided a coronavirus outbreak like those in China or South Korea, Tsai faces many of the same economic concerns as Taiwan’s neighbors. Growth in the first quarter cooled to the slowest pace since 2016, an increasing number of economists forecast the economy’s first contraction since 2009.And Taiwan’s companies could also suffer collateral damage from Trump’s efforts to push back against Chinese influence, such as new US rules barring any chipmaker using American equipment from supplying Huawei Technologies Co. Taiwan’s biggest company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., gets an estimated 14% of its revenue from Huawei.“In the next four years, Taiwan faces a variety of threats from China and some from the United States,” said Ashley Feng, a research associate with the Center for a New American Security. “Opportunities for China and Taiwan to cooperate over the next four years are limited and shrinking.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-s-tsai-ing-wen-riding-high-into-second-term-as-trump-fights-china/story-bTcGP8uue46tnN9a7tBJEP.html
20-05-2020||World||US extends heightened border enforcement during coronavirus||A Trump administration policy of quickly expelling most migrants stopped along the border because of the Covid-19 pandemic was indefinitely extended Tuesday, with a top US health official arguing that what had been a short-term order was still needed to protect the country from the virus.The order issued by Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, authorizes Customs and Border Protection to immediately remove migrants, including people seeking asylum, as a way to prevent the potential spread of the virus while in custody.President Donald Trump issued the initial 30-day order in March, and it was extended for another month in April. The new version notably has no fixed end date, though it says the CDC will review public health data every 30 days to ensure it is still necessary.Administration officials have defended the policy amid criticism from human rights advocates who say the US is using health as a pretext to deny people the right to seek asylum and to enact immigration policies aimed at appealing to supporters of the president in an election year.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“Trump’s goal is not to protect our health, it’s to sow division and advance his political agenda,” said Andrea Flores, deputy director of immigration policy for the American Civil Liberties Union.Under the policy, CBP has been sending Mexican and Central American migrants they encounter along the southwestern border back to Mexico in about two hours. It is turning people from other countries over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for rapid repatriation, removing people who might have remained in the country for months, or even years, to pursue asylum claims.Human Rights First, a nonpartisan human rights organization, said the CDC order has already been used to block and expel thousands of asylum-seekers to dangerous places.“This new extension of the CDC order will end US refugee and child protections at the border indefinitely, endangering rather than saving lives,” said Eleanor Acer, the group’s senior director for refugee protection. “There is little doubt that the Trump administration will wield this indefinite ban to expel and block asylum-seekers and children for many months or longer, possibly until this administration is no longer in office.”The US is also quickly expelling migrants encountered entering across the northern border with Canada, though there are far fewer than along the southwest.Acting US Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf said in announcing the extension that the restrictions were one of the most critical tools his department has to “prevent the further spread of the virus and to protect the American people, DHS front-line officers, and those in their care and custody from Covid-19.”The previous order was due to expire Wednesday. Redfield said the new one would remain in effect until “the danger of further introduction of Covid-19 into the United States has ceased to be a serious danger to the public health.” He also noted that vaccines and treatment for the virus were still months away and that cases were increasing in the US, Canada and Mexico.Canada, Mexico and the US shut their borders by mutual agreement to nonessential traffic in March to help control the spread of the virus.Trump followed that up in April with an executive order that halted immigration to the US for 60 days in an effort to limit competition for jobs amid the economic collapse from the outbreak.The president has long advocated restrictions on both legal and illegal immigration and has raised concerns for years about foreigners competing with American citizens for jobs. But he denied he was using the virus to make good on a long-standing campaign promise during an election year.Also Tuesday, the Trump administration asked a federal appeals court to allow it to terminate an agreement that places limits on the detention of immigrant children.Justice Department lawyer August Flentje told a panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in California that “repeated border crises that are driven by irregular family migration” required the government to adopt new rules and replace what’s known as the Flores settlement.In court filings, lawyers for migrants said ending the agreement would give ICE new powers to detain children and parents indefinitely and “eviscerate their right to a neutral review of whether they are eligible for release.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-extends-heightened-border-enforcement-during-coronavirus/story-KTnAtkFKyvqBCPKuYA3oiO.html
20-05-2020||World||States accused of fudging or bungling Covid-19 testing data||As large parts of the US ease their lockdowns against the coronavirus, public health officials in some states are being accused of bungling infection statistics or even deliberately using a little sleight of hand to make things look better than they are.The result is that politicians, business owners and ordinary Americans who are making decisions about reopenings and other day-to-day matters risk being left with the impression that the virus is under more control than it actually is.In Virginia, Texas and Vermont, for example, officials said they have been combining the results of viral tests, which show an active infection, with antibody tests, which show a past infection. Public health experts say that can make for impressive-looking testing totals but does not give a true picture of how the virus is spreading.In Florida, the data scientist who developed the state’s coronavirus dashboard, Rebekah Jones, said this week that she was fired for refusing to manipulate data “to drum up support for the plan to reopen.” Calls to health officials for comment were not immediately returned Tuesday.In Georgia, one of the earliest states to ease up on lockdowns and assure the public it was safe to go out again, the Department of Public Health published a graph around May 11 that purportedly showed new COVID-19 cases declining over time in the most severely affected counties. The entries, however, were not arranged in chronological order but in descending order.Georgia state Rep. Jasmine Clark, a Democrat with a doctorate in microbiology, called the graph a “prime example of malfeasance,” adding: “Science matters, and data manipulation is not only dangerous, but leads to distrust in our institutions.” Democratic state Rep. Scott Holcomb likewise called the department’s presentations “purposely misleading.” Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s office denied there was any attempt to deceive the public.Guidelines from the Trump administration say that before states begin reopening, they should see a 14-day downward trend in infections. However, some states have reopened when infections were still climbing or had plateaued. States have also been instructed to expand testing and contact tracing.The US has recorded 1.5 million confirmed infections and over 90,000 deaths.Vermont and Virginia said they stopped combining the two types of tests in the past few days. Still, health officials in Virginia, where Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam has eased up on restrictions, said that combining the numbers caused “no difference in overall trends.” In Texas, where health officials said last week that they were including some antibody results in their testing totals and case counts, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday that the numbers are not being commingled. Health officials did not respond to requests for clarification.Georgia’s Department of Public Health also regularly publishes a graph that shows cases over time, except new infections are not listed on the day they came back positive, which is the practice in many other states. Instead, Georgia lists new cases on the day the patient first reported symptoms.That practice can shift the timeline of the outbreak and make it appear as if the state is moving past the peak.Kemp spokesperson Candice Broce insisted that the governor’s office is not telling the department what to do and that officials are not trying to dress up data to make Kemp look better, saying that “could not be further from the truth.” As for the May 11 graph, Broce said public health officials were trying to highlight which days had seen the highest peaks of infections. “It was not intended to mislead,” Broce said Tuesday. “It was always intended to be helpful.” Thomas Tsai, a professor at the Harvard Global Health Institute, said the way Georgia reports data makes it harder to understand what the current conditions are, and he worries that other states may also be presenting data in a way that doesn’t capture the most up-to-date information.In other developments, the White House scrambled to defend President Donald Trump’s decision to use the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to fend off the coronavirus. The drug is unproven against the virus, and the president’s move spurred fears that many Americans might start using the medication, which carries potentially fatal side effects.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany emphasized that “any use of hydroxychloroquine has to be in consultation with your doctor.” More than 4.8 million people worldwide have been confirmed infected by the virus, and about 320,000 deaths have been recorded, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that experts believe is too low.

20-05-2020||World||26 scientists among 150 Indians returning home from S Africa this week||Twenty-six Indian scientists stranded in South Africa’s Cape Town due to a coronavirus lockdown will be heading back home this week. They had been on a mission to Antarctica and stuck in South Africa three months ago after the imposition of the lockdown. The scientists are among around 150 Indian nationals who will be returning home on a South African Airways (SAA) flight that will leave Johannesburg on Friday for Mumbai and Delhi.Indian Consul General in Johannesburg, Anju Ranjan, said over 1,000 Indian nationals had registered for the the flight. Passengers had to be vetted by the Indian mission based on a criteria set by the South African Department of Home Affairs. “We had to select priority passengers depending on their need,” Ranjan said in a Facebook broadcast. The diplomat said those left out are likely to be repatriated on an Air India flight under the Indian government’s Vande Bharat mission. “People who are going back on this flight include 26 scientists from India who were stuck in Cape Town after they returned from a mission to Antarctica,” Ranjan said. “They were here for the past three months, so this was a priority for us to send them back to India,” the official said. Ranjan said 93 members of the ISE Cruise who were stuck in the coastal city of Durban were also a priority for them. Others approved for the flight are those who are ill or on a temporary tourist visa. Ranjan said the ticket price for the one-way flight was 15,000 rands, which was fixed by the SAA and the Indian government had nothing to do with it. The fare, which is almost thrice the normal ticket price, has to be paid by the passengers themselves. An Air India flight can be expected in phase 3 of the Vande Bharat mission in June as there is no fixed date for it yet, Ranjan said. Currently, the mission in phase 2, the official added. “Many people who could not pay could not be accommodated on the flight. I feel very sorry for them, but we can have some say and discounts when we get our own flights, so I just want them to wait patiently and not feel disheartened,” Ranjan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/26-scientists-among-150-indians-returning-home-from-s-africa-this-week/story-1a9OygHi9VQZYBtVouFwBM.html
20-05-2020||World||US births fall, and Covid-19 could drive them down more||US births continued to fall last year, leading to the fewest number of newborns in 35 years.The decline is the latest sign of a prolonged national “baby bust” that’s been going on for more than a decade. And some experts believe the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the economy will suppress the numbers further.“This unpredictable environment, and anxiety about the future, is going to make women think twice about having children,” said Dr Denise Jamieson, chair of obstetrics and gynaecology at Emory University.The latest numbers were released Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report, which is considered preliminary, is based on a review of more than 99% of birth certificates issued last year.The CDC found the number of births fell about 1% from 2018, to about 3.7 million. Birth rates continued to fall for teen moms and for women in their 20s.Aside from a one-year uptick in 2014, US births have been falling every year since 2007, when a recession hit the country. The drop continued even after the economy rebounded.Experts say there are a number of causes, but chief among them are shifting attitudes about motherhood: Many women and couples delay childbearing and have fewer kids once they start. The economy is a factor, but not because of short-term cycles in hiring. Many jobs are low-paying and unstable, and that coupled with high rents and other factors have caused women and couples to be much more cautious about having kids, said John Santelli, a Columbia University professor of population and family health.It’s unclear what will happen to births this year, said Brady Hamilton, the CDC report’s lead author. The impact of the last few months’ events won’t become clear in maternity wards until late this year or early next, he said.Santelli said it’s possible births will go up, at least among some groups. Access to birth control and abortion has become more difficult, and some homebound couples may find themselves with greater opportunity to conceive, he said.But others say it’s more likely births will plummet.The idea that there will be a lot of “coronababies” is “widely is widely perceived as a myth,” said Hans-Peter Kohler, a University of Pennsylvania fertility researcher.The debate most demographers are having is not about whether there will be a decline, but whether it will be lasting, he said.“The decline due to COVID-19 might be different given the extent and severity of the crisis, and the long-lasting uncertainty that is caused by it,” Kohler wrote in an email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-births-fall-and-covid-19-could-drive-them-down-more/story-rVZM818pTy5O7m3NITDQUJ.html
20-05-2020||World||Trump’s use of malaria drug likely to be welcomed in India||President Donald Trump’s declaration that he was taking a malaria drug of dubious effectiveness to help fend off the coronavirus will likely be welcomed in India.Trump’s previous endorsement of hydroxychloroquine catalyzed a tremendous shift in the South Asian country, spurring the world’s largest producer of the drug to make much more of it, prescribe it for front-line health workers treating the virus and deploy it as a diplomatic tool, despite mounting evidence against using the drug for Covid-19.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageTrump said Monday that he was taking hydroxychloroquine as a measure of protection against the virus. The US Food and Drug Administration, however, has cautioned against using it outside of hospitals because of the risk of serious heart problems.Suhhil Gupta, a pharmacist in New Delhi, said Tuesday that Trump’s announcement shouldn’t carry any weight in India.“He’s not a pharmacist. His statements are not relevant to the field,” Gupta said.Still, India’s policy on the decades-old drug, used to prevent malaria and treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, drastically changed after Trump tweeted in March that the drug, used together with an antibiotic, could be “game changers” in the fight against the pandemic. India’s health ministry quickly approved it as a prophylactic for health care workers and others at high risk of infection, and as a treatment for critically ill patients.Officials in Mumbai even drew up a plan to administer hydroxychloroquine to thousands of slum dwellers as a preventive measure against the virus.Indian health officials have declined repeated requests for comment, limiting communications to daily health briefings, the last of which occurred May 11.The rules say that drugs such as hydroxychloroquine be used only after a rigorous scientific and ethical review, continued oversight by an ethics committee and ensuring informed consent — none of which happened with hydroxychloroquine, according to Dr. Amar Jesani, a medical ethics expert.The Mumbai proposal was ultimately shelved amid questions of the ethics of administering the malaria drug without first subjecting it to clinical trials. Still, the Indian government has recommended more and more people use it, contravening 2017 rules for emergency use of untested drugs, Jesani said.India initially banned hydroxychloroquine exports, but lifted the ban after Trump threatened “retaliation.” At the same time, India’s government ordered manufacturers to ramp up production from 1.2 million to 3 million pills a month — causing company shares to skyrocket. From the US to Australia, sales jumped.Officials have even said that Indian plantations could increase the growing capacity of cinchona trees, whose bark contains the compound quinine, which has been used to treat malaria since the 1860s. Quinine can also be made synthetically.The Indian government itself purchased 100 million hydroxychloroquine pills, according to government data, to distribute to states and donate to countries including Afghanistan, Myanmar and the Dominican Republic.India is the world’s largest producer of generic drugs, a fast-growing industry that has brought down pharmaceutical prices globally. During the HIV/AIDs crisis, India played a similar role as in the coronavirus pandemic, boosting global supplies of life-saving drugs.The problem this time, experts say, is that the hydroxychloroquine hype is based on a flimsy study, with little to no evidence that it prevents or treats Covid-19.Still, a sharp rise in demand has reduced supplies for patients with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.India’s hurried guidance has also impeded scientific trials that could determine whether the benefits of taking hydroxychloroquine outweigh the risks.“We should do a trial. I think that is the right way to come to answer on this question. But the (government) made our job harder,” said Dr. Bharath Kumar, whose team has proposed a trial.Meanwhile, evidence against using hydroxychloroquine for the coronavirus is growing.A US study of 368 patients in veterans’ hospitals, the largest study yet examining the malaria drug’s value as a coronavirus antidote, found no benefits and even more deaths among those given the drug.The Indian government’s own assessment of 19 drugs found that hydroxychloroquine wasn’t the most promising. A task force noted that while hydroxychloroquine was readily available, the strength of scientific evidence for the mechanism of action was fairly low.With more than 101,000 cases and 3,163 deaths, the coronavirus hasn’t yet overwhelmed India’s limited health care system. But that’s starting to change in some hot spots as a stringent weeks-long nationwide lockdown begins to ease, allowing for greater mobility of the country’s 1.3 billion people.Nowhere is this clearer than in Maharashtra, the coastal state in central India bearing a third of India’s virus caseload. The state’s medical education and research agency has been administering hydroxychloroquine to patients in public hospitals and clinics, according to court records.Agency chief Dr. Tatyarao P. Lahane said protocols set by India’s government were being followed and declined to answer further questions.Dr. Shriprakash Kalantri of the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences in Maharashtra said the government was recommending hydroxychloroquine for “off label,” or unapproved, use, meaning that patients must be told that “there is a small but significant risk that it might harm you.”“If there is no evidence backed by solid clinical trials, then why are the scientific bodies pushing this drug and giving an impression to the public that this is a magic bullet and this is your last hope?” Kalantri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-use-of-malaria-drug-likely-to-be-welcomed-in-india/story-wuNFZxYeHLEp6DTIKeA61L.html
20-05-2020||World||Australia to relax some domestic travel curbs amid Covid-19 pandemic||Australians in the country’s most populous state will be able to vacation within its borders next month, when art galleries and museums will also reopen, as officials seek to boost an economy hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.The move will allow New South Wales state, home to Sydney, to open up tourist regions on its southern coast that were badly damaged by huge bushfires before the virus wreaked further havoc.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageNSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said people would still need to adapt to a “new normal” as officials maintain some of the social distancing measures that have been credited with keeping both Covid-19 cases and deaths relatively low.“We want people to enjoy themselves, to feel free, but at the same time please know that nothing we do is the same during a pandemic,” she said during a televised media conference.“We want to people to feel encouraged and hopeful about the future, but we also want people to be realistic, in that a Covid-safe environment will look and feel very different to what it did before the pandemic.”Australia has reported just over 7,000 infections, including 100 deaths, among its population of 25 million.NSW, the hardest hit state, logged just four new cases over the past 24 hours, all international travellers already in quarantine. More than 7,000 test results over the same period showed no community transmission, Berejiklian said.Australia’s states and territories are implementing a three-step federal government plan to unwind lockdown measures at a staggered pace, meaning different areas of the country have different restrictions.In Victoria state, authorities were using a controversial smartphone contact tracing app for the first time to track the movements of a person who was confirmed on Monday to have the disease.Almost 6 million Australians have downloaded the app, still short of the 40% of the population the government has said would make it an effective tool, amid privacy concerns about the use of the data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-to-relax-some-domestic-travel-curbs-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-cgzRdJ63F2Lzm4nldWV34N.html
20-05-2020||World||‘My decision to make’: Trump defends criticised use of antimalarial drug HCQ for Covid-19||President Donald Trump emphatically defended himself Tuesday against criticism from medical experts that his announced use of a malaria drug against the coronavirus could spark wide misuse by Americans of the unproven treatment with potentially fatal side effects.Trump’s revelation a day earlier that he was taking hydroxychloroquine caught many in his administration by surprise and set off an urgent effort by officials to justify his action. But their attempt to address the concerns of health professionals was undercut by the president himself.He asserted without evidence that a study of veterans raising alarm about the drug was “false” and an “enemy statement,” even as his own government warned that the drug should be administered for COVID-19 only in a hospital or research setting.“If you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,” Trump said. That was an apparent reference to a study of hundreds of patients treated by the Department of Veterans Affairs in which more of those in a group who were administered hydroxychloroquine died than among those who weren’t.“They were very old. Almost dead,” Trump said. “It was a Trump enemy statement.” During a Cabinet meeting, he elicited a defense of his practice from other officials, including VA Secretary Robert Wilkie who noted that the study in question was not conducted by his agency.But the drug has not been shown to combat the virus in a multitude of other studies as well. Two large observational studies, each involving around 1,400 patients in New York, recently found no COVID benefit from hydroxychloroquine. Two new ones published last week in the medical journal BMJ reached the same conclusion.No large, rigorous studies have found the drug safe or effective for preventing or treating COVID-19.Trump said he decided to take hydroxychloroquine after two White House staffers tested positive for the disease, but he already had spent months promoting the drug as a potential cure or preventive despite the cautionary advice of many of his administration’s top medical professionals.“This is an individual decision to make,” Trump told reporters during a visit to Capitol Hill to meet with Senate Republicans. He later claimed, “It’s gotten a bad reputation only because I’m promoting it.”Many studies are testing hydroxychloroquine for preventing or limiting coronavirus illness but “at this point in time there’s absolutely no evidence that this strategy works,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious-disease specialist at Emory University in Atlanta.“My concern is, the president has a big bully pulpit ... maybe people will think there’s some non-public evidence” that the drug works because Trump has chosen to use it, del Rio said. “It creates this conspiracy theory that something works and they’re not telling me about it yet.”The veterans study that Trump slammed was an analysis by researchers at several universities of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin in COVID-19 patients at veterans hospitals across the nation. It found no benefit and more deaths among those given hydroxychloroquine versus standard care alone. The work was posted on an online site for researchers and has not been reviewed by other scientists. Grants from the National Institutes of Health and the University of Virginia paid for the work.Addressing concerns that Trump’s example could lead people to misuse the drug, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that “tens of millions of people around the world have used this drug for other purposes,” including malaria prophylaxis. She emphasized, “You have to have a prescription. That’s the way it must be done.”The drug is also prescribed for some lupus and arthritis patients.Trump said his doctor did not recommend hydroxychloroquine to him, but that he requested it from the White House physician.That physician, Dr. Sean Conley, said in a statement that, after “numerous discussions” with Trump, “we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks.”The Food and Drug Administration warned health professionals last month that the drug should not be used to treat COVID-19 outside hospital or research settings because of sometimes-fatal side effects. Regulators issued the alert, in part, based on increased reports of dangerous side effects called in to U.S. poison control centers.Calls to centers involving hydroxychloroquine increased last month to 96, compared with 49 in April 2019, according to data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers provided to the AP. It was the second month of elevated reports involving the drug, following 79 calls in March. The problems reported included abnormal heart rhythms, seizures, nausea and vomiting.Trump dismissed reports of side effects, claiming, “What has been determined is it doesn’t harm you. Very powerful drug, I guess, but it doesn’t harm you.”He added, “I’ve had no impact from it.”FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said in an emailed statement Tuesday: “The decision to take any drug is ultimately a decision between a patient and their doctor.”As research started to emerge that hydroxychloroquine was not helpful, and even potentially harmful, in battling COVID-19, the president’s public rhetoric in support of the drug had faded. But his private hopes had not, according to three White House officials and Republicans close to the White House not authorized to speak publicly about private discussions.Trump also lashed out at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, calling her a “sick woman” who has “a lot of mental problems” after she questioned Trump’s use of the drug because he is 73 and falsely labeled him “morbidly obese.” Her comments were followed by Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who told MSNBC that Trump’s move was “reckless, reckless, reckless.“Trump’s presumptive Democratic opponent in the 2020 election, Joe Biden, chastised the president for being irresponsible in taking hydroxychloroquine.“What is he doing? What in God’s name is he doing?” Biden said during a Yahoo News town hall Tuesday night. “The words of a president matter.”After two staffers were known to test positive for COVID-19 earlier this month, the White House mandated that those in the West Wing wear face coverings and introduced daily testing for the president, vice president and those they come in close contact with.Pence told Fox on Tuesday that he was not taking the drug because his doctor did not recommend it, but said he “would never begrudge any American taking the advice of their physician.”Prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine surged roughly 80% in March to more than 830,000 compared with same period in the prior year, according to data tracking firm IQVIA. That jump in prescribing came before the federal government accepted nearly 30 million doses of the drug donated to the strategic national stockpile by foreign drugmakers. Since then, millions of those tablets have been shipped to U.S. hospitals nationwide for use treating patients with COVID-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/my-decision-to-make-trump-defends-criticised-use-of-antimalarial-drug-hcq-for-covid-19/story-pyu1HreuneonwKZPkUfa7N.html
20-05-2020||World||‘This is war’: Virus charges beyond Latin American hotspots||Beyond the hotspots of Brazil and Mexico, the coronavirus is threatening to overwhelm Latin American cities stretching from Chile to the Colombian Amazon in an alarming sign that the pandemic may be only at the start of its destructive march through the region.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage More than 90% of intensive care beds were full last week in Chile’s capital, Santiago, whose main cemetery dug 1,000 emergency graves to prepare for a wave of deaths.In Lima, Peru, patients took up 80% of intensive care beds as of Friday. Peru has the world’s 12th-highest number of confirmed cases, with more than 90,000.“We’re in bad shape,” said Pilar Mazzetti, head of the Peruvian government’s Covid-19 task force. “This is war.” In some cities, doctors say patients are dying because of a lack of ventilators or because they couldn’t get to a hospital fast enough. With intensive care units swamped, officials plan to move patients from capitals like Lima and Santiago to hospitals in smaller cities that aren’t as busy — running the risk of spreading the disease further.Latin American countries halted international flights and rolled out social distancing guidelines around the same time as the US and Europe, delaying the arrival of large-scale infection, said Dr Marcos Espinal, director of communicable diseases at the Pan American Health Organization.“Latin America was the last wave,” said Espinal, who previously worked at the World Health Organization.He warned that authorities need to maintain anti-virus restrictions even as the US and Europe reopen. Some of the hardest-hit cities, like Lima and Santiago, imposed strict, early lockdowns.But officials have struggled to enforce them, whether among the wealthy who are used to flouting regulations or lower-income people who depend on day labor or selling things on the street to feed their families.Latin America is the world’s most unequal region, a reality that Espinal said made it difficult to balance health and economic growth, with millions facing increased poverty during quarantines, curfews and shutdowns.A month after swamping the Ecuadorian coastal city of Guayaquil in one of the first serious blows to Latin America, Covid-19 is sickening thousands in the capital of Quito, where 80% of intensive care beds were occupied as of Friday.“In terms of intensive care, we’re stripped bare,” city health secretary Lenín Mantilla said.Quito has more than 2,400 confirmed infections, and Health Minister Juan Carlos Zevallos said he expected the peak to come toward the end of June. He assured citizens that the city was prepared and would avoid the fate of Guayaquil, where hundreds died at home, left in living rooms for days before overworked coroners could retrieve the bodies. Those who perished in hospitals in coastal cities were put in chilled shipping containers that served as makeshift morgues.The number of deaths in Quito jumped alarmingly over the weekend, from 114 to 209, and doctors said they dreaded the coming days.“I have a 26-year-old woman next to me who walked in. Three hours later, she’s suffocating because we don’t have a respirator available,’‘ said an intensive care doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak to the media. “I think we’re getting to the point that you saw in Europe, where people died for lack of respirators.” Ecuador has banned most private car trips and imposed a 2 pm to 5 am daily quarantine, but thousands of people can be seen buying from street vendors across the capital.The worst-hit country in Latin America remains Brazil, which is third in the world for reported infections — at more than 250,000 — even with limited testing. More than 85 percent of intensive care beds are full in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.Now, other countries are surging. Chile has imposed new restrictions in Santiago after cases doubled over the past week, to more than 34,000 in the country of 18 million people.Under the new restrictions, people will have to receive a police permit to leave home, with violators fined the equivalent of thousands of dollars. Essential workers are exempted.“We’re on very, very thin ice,” said Claudio Castillo, a professor of public policy and health at the University of Santiago.In Colombia’s Amazon region, cases have shot up in recent weeks, from 105 at the start of the month to 1,006 on Monday. The infections are concentrated in Leticia, a city on the Amazon river that borders both Brazil and Peru.Locals believe it’s related to the increase in cases in Brazil’s Amazon. Even though Colombia’s president has militarised the border, many still cross. Residents often work in one country and live in the other.Leticia relies on two poorly equipped hospitals, which have about a half-dozen respirators between them. Authorities recently began transporting seriously ill patients to Bogota after a failure at a hospital oxygen plant. Officials said Monday that they will open hotels in Leticia to take in people with less severe coronavirus cases.Health workers also complain of limited access to testing and say they are overworked to the point of collapse.In Mexico, intensive care occupancy is below 50 per cent in most cities, although deaths have begun to overwhelm funeral homes and crematoriums in the Mexico City borough of Iztapalapa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-is-war-virus-charges-beyond-latin-american-hotspots/story-UEDfT0IQySAAJb8HPUnd7M.html
20-05-2020||World||Donald Trump shoots letter to WHO, threatens to exit world body||US President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to pull America out of the World Health Organization (WHO) and permanently stop US funding for the world body if it did not “commit to major substantive improvements” in the next 30 days. Underlining Washington’s escalating fight with Beijing, Trump said the WHO needs to show “independence from China”. He earlier labelled the WHO as a “puppet of China”.In a letter to WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Trump accused the organisation of “repeated missteps” in responding to the pandemic.Trump shared the letter on Twitter hours after Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the WHO’s governing body, the World Health Assembly, by video link. Xi promised to devote $2 billion towards fighting the pandemic over the next two years.WHO head Tedros later said that he would keep leading the global fight against the pandemic.Commenting on Trump’s letter, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said it was “full of insinuations” and aimed “to mislead the public and achieve the purpose of stigmatising China’s epidemic control efforts while shirking its own responsibility”. He said the US has an obligation to pay the full WHO membership fee.“Arbitrarily cutting funding to an international organisation is unilateralist behaviour,” Zhao said. “We urge the US to stop passing the buck and deepen international cooperation.”In the letter, Trump wrote, “It is clear repeated missteps by you and your organisation in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world. The only way forward for the organisation is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China.”He also wrote that if the WHO “does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze on US funding permanent and reconsider our membership.”Later, when Trump was asked about the reforms he wants the WHO to carry out, he said, “They have to clean up their act. They have to do a better job. They have to be much more fair to other countries, including the US, or we are not going to b involved with them any more and we will go our separate way.”The US president had suspended US funding for the WHO - at more than $400 million annually - in April.The US has exited a number of world bodies and pacts during Trump’s tenure, starting with the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017. It was followed by departures from Paris Accord, Unesco, Iran Nuclear Deal and UNHCR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-shoots-letter-to-who-threatens-to-exit-world-body/story-pSIypEPoIScSOUHKydBQNM.html

The pandemic has killed at least 17,971 people in Brazil, according to the Health Ministry.Brazil overtook Britain on Monday to become the country with the third-highest number of confirmed infections, behind Russia and the United States. Brazil’s confirmed cases also jumped by a record 17,408 on Tuesday, for a total of 271,628 people who have tested positive for the virus.Bolsonaro, an ideological ally of Trump, has been criticized for his handling of the outbreak, such as opposition to restrictions on movement he sees as too damaging to the economy.Bolsonaro said Interim Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello would issue new guidelines on Wednesday expanding the recommended use of the anti-malarial drug chloroquine to treat the coronavirus.Two trained doctors have resigned as Health Minister in the past month as Bolsonaro defies public health expert advice.Bolsonaro told website Blog do Magno that Pazuello, an active-duty army general, would sign the new chloroquine guidelines and keep the top job for now. Bolsonaro added that his mother is 93 years old, and he keeps a box of chloroquine on hand should she need it.Trump, who announced on Monday he was taking chloroquine preventively, told reporters on Tuesday: “I don’t want people coming over here and infecting our people. I don’t want people over there sick either. We’re helping Brazil with ventilators ... Brazil is having some trouble, no question about it.”Pan American Health Organization officials said in a virtual briefing they were concerned about the virus’ spread in the tri-border area of the Amazon between Colombia, Peru and Brazil. They urged special measures to protect vulnerable populations among the indigenous, poor and racial minorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-1-179-brazil-registers-highest-one-day-highest-one-day-covid-19-deaths/story-LxDwV1r6NzH2nxpPxdom7J.html
20-05-2020||World||H-1B visa holders do not adversely affect US workers: Report||H-1B visa holders do not adversely affect US workers, a new research said on Tuesday, suggesting that the presence of the workforce holding such visas boosts employment among other workers in an occupation.The National Foundation for American Policy said that the findings of its new research should give pause to policymakers considering imposing additional restrictions on the H-1B program. There is little reason to think doing so will help American workers, it said in its latest research.“H-1B visa holders do not adversely affect US workers, according to new research. On the contrary, the evidence points to the presence of H-1B visa holders being associated with lower unemployment rates and faster earnings growth among college graduates, including recent college graduates,” the report said.“Further, the results suggest that, if anything, being in a field with more H-1B visa holders makes it more likely that US-born young college graduates work in a job closely related to their college major,” it said.The study uses data from 2005 to 2018 to examine how the number of approved petitions to hire H-1B visa holders as a share of college graduates within each of 22 occupations affects the unemployment rate and earnings growth rate in those occupations.An increase in the share of workers with an H-1B visa within an occupation, on average, reduces the unemployment rate in that occupation, the report said. The results indicate that a 1 percentage point increase in the share of workers with an H-1B visa in an occupation reduces the unemployment rate by about 0.2 percentage points.The findings suggest the presence of H-1B visa holders boosts employment among other workers in an occupation. The results provide no evidence that the H-1B program has an adverse impact on labour market opportunities for US workers, it added.According to the report, while critics often allege that H-1B visas reduce wages or suppress wage growth, this finding on the opposite is consistent with research showing that H-1B visa holders earn at least as much as similar US workers, if not more.The results further indicate H-1B visa holders do not adversely affect US-born college graduates during the early years of their careers. Having more approved total or initial H-1B petitions, on average, reduces the unemployment rate within a major-occupation for recent graduates.It provides no evidence that recent college graduates have worse labour market outcomes if there are more H-1B visa holders in jobs closely related to their college major, the report said.Noting that the results of the research indicate that H-1B visa holders do not adversely affect US workers, the report said that the H-1B program is small relative to the size of the college-graduate workforce, likely accounting for at most two per cent of highly educated US workers.H-1B visa holders are concentrated in computer-related occupations but account for only a small share of workers in information technology (IT) jobs. Despite the H-1B program’s small scale, the visa category is important to the US economy and to employers that use it to fill gaps in their workforce.The presence of H-1B visa holders increases innovation, productivity and profits at H-1B employers and boosts total productivity and innovation in the United States.

The Schantzes tossed the bags in the back of their pickup truck and kept riding, according to Emily Schantz. Only when the Schantzes returned home did they discover the bags contained money, she said.“Inside of the bag, there were plastic baggies and they were addressed with something that said ‘cash vault,’” Schantz told WTVR.They contacted the Caroline County Sheriff’s Office, which sent deputies to the home. The deputies took inventory and determined the money totalled nearly USD 1 million.Caroline Sheriff’s Maj. Scott Moser said authorities have since determined where the money was headed, but are still trying to figure out how it ended up in the middle of a road in Goochland County. Moser would not say specifically where the money was going. But he said he hopes the recipients offer the Schantzes a nice reward.“Their actions deserve nothing less,” Moser said. “They saved someone a lot of money and set a wonderful example for everyone else.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/family-in-us-goes-out-for-a-drive-find-nearly-1-million-in-road/story-dYAFcxgt39j2kkyOveS1qL.html
20-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Cambridge teaching to go online next academic year||There will be no face-to-face lectures in the University of Cambridge in the next academic year beginning October 6 as part of plans to deal with coronavirus pandemic that has left British universities reeling with financial and other challenges.Teaching in the current Easter term in Cambridge was moved to online in April, but university authorities have now decided to continue to teach and hold exams online in 2020-21. If the official advice changes, it may be possible to hold some small teaching groups in person.Cambridge is among several universities bracing for lesser number of Indian and other non-EU international students turning up when the next academic year begins in September-October. The university sector has sought a bailout from the government.A Cambridge spokesman said: “The university is constantly adapting to changing advice as it emerges during this pandemic. Given that it is likely that social distancing will continue to be required, the university has decided there will be no face-to-face lectures during the next academic year”.“Lectures will continue to be made available online and it may be possible to host smaller teaching groups in person, as long as this conforms to social-distancing requirements. This decision has been taken now to facilitate planning, but as ever, will be reviewed should there be changes to official advice on coronavirus.”Universities moving to a virtual learning environment will deprive students of “campus experience”, which is one of the key attractions of international students to come to the UK. Stake-holders say it should be made clear to students how they would be taught before they arrive for the next academic year.In April, five unions warned the government that universities must be given extra protection during the pandemic to ensure their financial survival; some universities were already facing major financial challenges before the pandemic struck.Until recently, ministers, diplomats and stake-holders were hailing an increase in the number of Indian students based on visas granted, but there are now concerns over the extent of the new intake from September-October.In a joint letter to higher education minister Michelle Donelan, the unions representing higher education staff sought urgent assurances that universities will not be allowed to collapse financially as a result of the outbreak, backed up with legislation.The unions – UNISON, University and College Union (UCU), GMB, Unite and the Educational Institute of Scotland – said in a letter to the government that the university sector is too valuable for any institutions to get into financial difficulties.The letter says: “The university sector is one of the most productive and important parts of the UK economy with international students alone bringing in £7.3 billion each year and the sector as a whole generating £73 billion”.“We are already getting many reports of universities serving notifications of redundancies, and of contractors in universities sending staff home without pay or asking them to use their annual leave”.“It is no overstatement to say that such a response from universities will be disastrous for the individuals concerned and their families as well as for the future of the higher education sector – one of the most important industries in the UK”, it adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cambridge-teaching-to-go-online-next-academic-year/story-l6NeXSndIRHf6wGIe6InJN.html
20-05-2020||World||Canada, US extend border closure to non-essential travel||Canada and the US have agreed to extend their agreement to keep border closed to non-essential travel to June 21 during the coronavirus pandemic.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday the border is a source of vulnerability, so the agreement will be extended by another 30 days. The restrictions were announced on March 18 and were extended in April.Trudeau said Canada’s provincial leaders clearly wanted to continue the measures.“This will keep people in both of our countries safe.” Trudeau said.U.S. President Donald Trump also confirmed the extension, but looked forward to its eventual end, saying, “everything we want to get back to normal.”But many Canadians fear a reopening. The U.S. has more confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 than any country in the world, though its per capita numbers are well below many other nations.Essential cross-border workers like healthcare professionals, airline crews and truck drivers are still permitted to cross. Truck drivers are critical as they move food and medical goods in both directions. Much of Canada’s food supply comes from or via the U.S.Americans who are returning to America and Canadians who are returning to Canada are also exempted from the border closure.Canada sends 75% of its exports to the U.S. and about 18% of American exports go to Canada. The U.S. Canada border is world’s longest between two nations.___AP writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-us-extend-border-closure-to-non-essential-travel/story-0lHh6Pizph9zoTtfsqm3jO.html

What’s common among them? Like many people around the world these days, all of them are wearing masks! They have emerged as a symbol of this era, giving out the message that we won’t give up till we defeat our enemy. Even the gigantic dinosaur at Ripley’s Believe It Or Not, in Los Angeles, US, manages to smile behind his face mask! A few toys, books and music stores have reopened with curb side pickup.As the entire globe tries to curb the spread of coronavirus, masks have also been appearing on public artworks in countries across the world. While a few months ago, wearing a mask in public would have been a fashion no-no, they are now a necessary mechanism to fight the virus, and thus a valid accessory that brands are busy prettying up.Everyone seems to be getting increasingly comfortable with the idea of wearing masks. At the Erawan shrine in Bangkok, Thai dancer have been wearing face shields while performing. Brazilian fashion photographer Marcio Rodrigues wore a mask made with recyclable bottles, cans and boxes in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, while dancers at Shanghai Ballet Company are also training with their masks on during the coronavirus epidemic.Wearing the masks on, even the common people feel like warriors, ready to do their bit in this fight against an invisible yet deadly enemy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/smiling-behind-the-mask-facial-covering-symbolise-our-relentless-fight-against-covid-19/story-AQ4mE4yP9MzNaWTrRx6x4O.html
