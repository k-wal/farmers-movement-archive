07-05-2020||World||Israeli Parliament passes bills for formation of Netanyahu-Gantz unity government||Israel’s Parliament on Thursday approved amendments to two basic laws by a hefty majority, paving the way for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to form a fully functioning unity government for the first time since December 2018.The Knesset or Parliament voted by 71 votes to 37 to back the power-sharing deal between Netanyahu’s Likud and his main rival former military chief Benny Gantz’s Blue and White parties.The bills were supported by the lawmakers in Netanyahu’s Center-Right bloc, except for the lawmakers of Yamina, who absented themselves, because it is still unknown whether it will enter the coalition. Blue and White and Labor lawmakers voted in favour, except for Labor lawmaker Merav Michaeli, who opposes the government, The Jerusalem Post reported. The bills were necessary for Blue and White to be able to recommend Prime Minister Netanyahu to form a government by Thursday night’s deadline to prevent a fourth election, the paper said. The party is gathering the signatures of its lawmakers, which together with 52 lawmakers in the Center-Right bloc will give Netanyahu more than the 61 he needs to submit to President Reuven Rivlin. The development came a day after Israeli High Court ruled on Wednesday that Netanyahu may form a new government while under indictment for corruption charges. In their ruling, the 11 justices said there was no legal cause to intervene in the coalition agreement between the two parties.The petitions against Netanyahu were filed by advocacy groups that have asked the court to ban any indicted politician, including Netanyahu, from being allowed to form a new government. Netanyahu, 70, was indicted earlier this year on charges of accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust. He has denied any wrongdoing. His trial was postponed due to restrictions his hand-picked interim justice minister placed on the courts after the coronavirus crisis erupted and is scheduled to commence later this month. Netanyahu had signed the agreement with Gantz to form a national government last month after an unprecedented third round of polls which again did not give anybody a clear verdict to form the government. The deal allows Netanyahu to serve the first 18 months as Prime Minister after which Gantz would assume power for the next 18 months. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest serving prime minister, has held onto power as a caretaker leader for more than a year as political stalemate prevented the creation of a government and triggered successive elections. His ruling Likud party emerged as the single largest party with 36 seats in the 120-member Knesset after the third round of polls but the right-wing bloc led by him could garner only 58 seats, falling short of the simple majority of 61. Gantz won the backing of 61 Knesset members and was mandated by President Rivlin to form the next government but he chose to cut a deal with Netanyahu, even at the cost of splitting his Blue and White party given the difficulties of putting together a government in a highly divided Israeli polity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-parliament-passes-bills-for-formation-of-netanyahu-gantz-unity-government/story-mEaCAgoSb6CebVGt1ctVzI.html

Some of the passengers were carrying the Indian flags.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageIndian Ambassador Pavan Kapoor was seen enquiring about the procedure from some of the passengers undergoing medical screening at the Abu Dhabi airport.“Kudos to all the passengers for waiting patiently for their turn for medical screening and many thanks to all the frontline health workers and airport staff for extending full support,” the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi tweeted. There are no suspected COVID-19 cases among the first batch of passengers being repatriated on Thursday.“All of them have cleared the tests,” Consul General of India in Dubai Vipul was quoted as saying by the Gulf News.He said the criteria of passengers’ selection included medical cases, loss of jobs, pregnant women and senior citizens. Those with complications and financial issues were also picked.On Monday, the Indian government announced plans to begin a phased repatriation of its citizens stranded abroad from May 7. The government also said that Air India will operate 64 flights from May 7 to May 13 to bring back around 15,000 Indian nationals stranded abroad amid the COVID-19-induced lockdown.Short-listing the first passengers from among a database of more than 200,000 applicants, who include around 6,500 pregnant women, has been a mammoth task which posed several challenges for the missions, Neeraj Agrawal, Consul, Press, Information and Culture at the Indian Consulate in Dubai told the Gulf News.India is conducting its biggest ever repatriation exercise named Vande Bharat Mission—sans social distancing and COVID-19 tests to bring back stranded Indians from abroad.The Indian missions in the UAE finalised the list of passengers, who were chosen based on the compelling reasons they submitted while registering their names.“Only passengers with confirmed tickets must proceed to the airport. They are required to reach the airport five hours prior to departure,” Agrawal said.The Indian Consulate had appealed to passengers not to overcrowd the airport, maintain social distancing and follow all necessary precautions stipulated by the authorities Air India crew members on board the repatriation flights will be fully protected with protective gear, including Personal Protective Equipment, to reduce the risk of contracting coronavirus, Khaleej Times reported.The Indian expatriate community of approximately 3.42 million is reportedly the largest ethnic community in the UAE constituting roughly about 30 per cent of the country’s population, according to information available on the Indian Embassy website.India imposed a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the country, grounding all international flights since mid-March. Under the repatriation plan, the government will be facilitating the return of Indian nationals stranded abroad on compelling grounds in a phased manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/air-india-s-first-repatriation-flight-from-uae-takes-off-4-babies-also-on-board/story-alimAadnnAxmGeMDpLrvyK.html
07-05-2020||World||UK to announce very limited easing of covid lockdown next week||Prime Minister Boris Johnson will announce a very limited easing of Britain’s coronavirus lockdown next week, adopting a cautious approach to ensure there is no second peak of infections that could further hurt the economy.Johnson is due to announce the next steps in Britain’s battle to tackle the novel coronavirus on Sunday following a review by ministers of the current measures that have all but shut the economy and kept millions at home.At a cabinet meeting of his top ministers, Johnson said Britain would advance “with maximum caution” and be guided by the science and data when considering whether any of the strict social distancing measures could be eased.“Any easement to the guidelines next week will be very limited,” his spokesman told reporters.“We are at a critical moment in the fight against the virus and we will not do anything which risks throwing away the efforts and sacrifices of the British public.”Ministers are concerned that a swift easing of the lockdown could lead to a second peak in infection rates, which might overwhelm hospitals and force the government to shut down the economy for a second time.Earlier, the Bank of England held off from further stimulus measures on Thursday but said it was ready to take more action to counter the country’s biggest economic slump in over 300 years, caused by the lockdown.Johnson briefed opposition leaders on the latest situation, with Labour leader Keir Starmer saying there needed to be a national consensus on the next steps in tackling the virus.“He also reiterated the seven principles that he wants the government to consider when planning for the next phase, including safety at work and preventing a cliff-edge to the job protection scheme,” Starmer’s spokesman said.Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the only change to the lockdown which had been floated in the media which she might agree to in the immediate future was the limit on people only exercising once a day.“I must make judgements informed by the evidence that are right and safe for Scotland,” Sturgeon, who will decide on whether to ease measures in Scotland, told reporters.“I will not be pressured into lifting restrictions prematurely before I am as certain as I can be that we will not be risking a resurgence of infection rates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-announce-very-limited-easing-of-covid-lockdown-next-week/story-oxyVpymxX6oKfDbrtw9p2I.html

It can take years for Indians because there is a massive backlog of their applications, that gets higher every year because of the annual limit on the number of Green Cards that can be issued to applicants from any one country.More than 300,000 people in the Green Card queue are from India and the present laws are not changed, the waiting time for Indias could be as long as 150 years.The Trump administration has wanted to remove rescind the Obama-era rule but has not yet. The court has continued, meanwhile, starting in 2014, the year the rule was notified.Save Jobs’s challenge was thrown out in 2016 as the court concluded its members lacked standing, were not an affected party. That was a win for the Obama administration DHS.The court reversed the earlier ruling and said last November Save Jobs employees had standing. The plaintiff then sought an injunction blocking the rule. Affected H-1B visa holders India and a body representing them had argued against the injunction.And how this brief from DHS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-asks-court-to-not-block-work-permits-for-some-h-1b-spouses/story-WVhZGBDyFIZ188t9sLjNTP.html
07-05-2020||World||China faces risk of global ‘economic distancing’||Three countries and their relations in a post-Coronavirus world will determine which way global trading systems will sway in the future. China is one of them and is fighting with its back to the wall to keep its image untarnished as the other two -- Japan and United States - up the ante.The virus has definitely launched a be-wary-of-China campaign in most countries in Asia, Europe and certainly the United States.President Donald Trump has been succinct in provoking American industry to snap out of the Chinese production chains for American products.Other countries too joined the chorus. Several African countries protested the Chinese cover-up of the virus even as China aggressively pursued its global expansionist programs to Africa. Countries like Turkey cocked a snook by announcing that the antigen test kits imported from China were of inferior quality. It refused to distribute them among its citizens.Spain followed suit followed by the Netherlands returning ‘inferior quality” testing kits and face masks from China. Today it is about the quality of medical equipment from China.Kearney, the world’s influential consulting firm, released in early April its seventh annual Reshoring Index which said companies “will be compelled to go much further in rethinking their sourcing strategies, (and) their entire supply chains.” It was referring to American companies which the American media interpreted after the report’s release to mean that it is now time for these companies to leave China and re-assess their manufacturing.Forbes magazine, analysing the Kearney report, said: “The new SARS coronavirus has literally closed the economies of the Western world and created a public relations nightmare for China.”The magazine suspects the USA, which decades ago made China the hub of its manufacturing because of cheaper costs, is now looking at other south-east Asian countries including Vietnam, south-Asian countries like India and Mexico.Daily Wire, American political commentator Ben Shapiro’s right-wing news and opinion website, referred in a recent article to China’s bullying of the USA on the pharma front. To quote: ““In mid-March, Senator Marco Rubio told Fox News of an article in Xinhua, the Chinese state-run media agency, that stated: ‘‘If China retaliates against the United States at this time, in addition to announcing a travel ban on the United States, it will also announce strategic control over medical products and ban exports to the United States. Then the United States will be caught in the ocean of new coronaviruses”.Forbes put this quote in perspective in a celebrated article: “China is the go-to source for ibuprofen, hazmat suits, rubber gloves, surgical masks, ventilators... companies will want to hedge their supply chain strategy by spreading their risks. That doesn’t mean a full abandonment of China. It does mean China’s days as the go-to manufacturing hub for the Western world are over.”The trade war between the USA and China has deteriorated further after the Corona outbreak. China went into a lock down and its companies could not keep the supply lines to the US going. By March, factory closures became the norm. Supplies thus blocked, American businesses went dizzy. Then America itself went into a virus quarantine. Smarter, it is reconsidering shifting its supply bases abroad, specially from China.In Europe, the United Kingdom is leading the fight back against China’s corporate raider image. Amid the virus furore, UK parliamentarians opposed an attempt by a Chinese government-owned investment firm to install four directors in a British tech company that manufactures smartphone chips. The UK, like all of Europe, is wary of Chinese takeover plans of companies going under because of the Corona shut down. Here are some figures: China spent around $13 billion to acquire entities in Europe and another $25 billion in the USA.Reuters reported in mid-April: European Union’s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, told the Financial Times that member countries should buy stakes in companies to counter the threat of Chinese takeovers. Her comments “coming as the EU formulates plans to protect its businesses amid the coronavirus outbreak”.Unlike USA, Japan has already taken the initiative to get back the production bases of its companies from China. It has announced a $990 billion economic stimulus package that offers $2 billion to Japanese companies ready to shift base from China to Japan. The companies have not rejected the offer.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is in a bind. He is under pressure from severe right-wing groups to distance Japan from China. If that happens, it will undo everything the two countries assiduously nurtured over the last two decades.A recent Nikkei report said: ‘‘In Zhongnanhai, the area in central Beijing where leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the state government have their offices, “there are now serious concerns over foreign companies withdrawing from China,” a Chinese economic source said. “What has particularly been talked about is the clause in Japan’s emergency economic package that encourages (and funds) the re-establishment of supply chains.”Chinese President Xi Xinping was hitherto planning to use his first state visit to Japan in April - cancelled after the virus outbreak - as well as the Olympics in July - also cancelled - as an opportunity to close ranks with Japan at a time when its trade war with the United States was showing signs of affecting its domestic industry. Abe too was planning to silence his opposition by signing yet another development agreement with China.All that has come to a naught with economic survival becoming the buzz word.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-faces-risk-of-global-economic-distancing/story-C0lJTrbka6Tkf35tn0WIoK.html
07-05-2020||World||33 million have sought US unemployment aid since coronavirus hit||Nearly 3.2 million laid-off workers applied for unemployment benefits last week as the business shutdowns caused by the viral outbreak deepened the worst U.S. economic catastrophe in decades.Roughly 33.5 million people have now filed for jobless aid in the seven weeks since the coronavirus began forcing millions of companies to close their doors and slash their workforces. That is the equivalent of one in five Americans who had been employed back in February, when the unemployment rate had reached a 50-year low of just 3.5%.The Labor Department’s report Thursday suggests that layoffs, while still breathtakingly high, are steadily declining after sharp spikes in late March and early April. Initial claims for unemployment aid have now fallen for five straight weeks, from a peak of nearly 6.9 million during the week that ended March 28.Applications for jobless aid rose in just six states last week, including Maine, New Jersey, and Oklahoma, and declined in the 44 others.The report showed that 22.7 million people are now receiving unemployment aid — a rough measure of job losses since the shutdowns began. That figure lags a week behind the figures for first-time unemployment applications. And not everyone who applies for jobless aid is approved. The number of laid-off workers receiving aid is now equal to 15.5% of the workforce that’s eligible for unemployment benefits.Those figures are a rough proxy for the job losses and for the unemployment rate that will be released Friday, which will likely to be the worst since modern record-keeping began after World War II. The unemployment rate is forecast to reach 16%, the highest rate since the Great Depression, and economists estimate that 21 million jobs were lost last month. If so, it would mean that nearly all the job growth in the 11 years since the Great Recession ended has vanished in a single month.Even those stunning figures won’t fully capture the magnitude of the damage the coronavirus has inflicted on the job market. Many people who are still employed have had their hours reduced. Others have suffered pay cuts. Some who lost jobs in April and didn’t look for a new one in light of their bleak prospects won’t even be counted as unemployed. A broader measure — the proportion of adults with jobs — could hit a record low.The impact has fallen unevenly on the U.S. population, with Hispanics much more likely to suffer an economic hit. According to a survey in mid-April by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 61% of Hispanics said their household has lost income because of the coronavirus, whether through a layoff, reduced hours or pay cuts. That compares with 46% of blacks and 43% of whites who said so.Layoffs have also been more concentrated among the less-educated. Twenty-eight percent of Americans without college degrees say they’ve endured a layoff in their household, compared with 19% of people with college degrees.The official figures for jobless claims may also be under-counting layoffs. Surveys by academic economists and think tanks suggest that as many as 12 million workers who were laid off by mid-April did not file for unemployment benefits by then, either because they couldn’t navigate their state’s overwhelmed systems or they felt too discouraged to try.On Thursday, the government also reported how many self-employed, contractors and gig workers, who are newly eligible for jobless benefits, applied for them last week. Nearly 584,000 people did so. The government reported that figure separately because it isn’t adjusted for seasonal patterns, as the 3.2 million figure is.Economists are projecting that the gross domestic product — the broadest gauge of economic growth — is contracting in the current April-June quarter by a shocking 40% annual rate. As it does, more layoffs appear to be spreading beyond front-line industries like restaurants, hotels and retail stores.GE Aviation, for example, has said it is cutting up to 13,000 jobs. Uber will shed 3,700 positions. MGM Resorts International has announced that the furloughs of more than 60,000 employees could turn into layoffs.But the job cuts have hammered workers at restaurants, hotels and retail firms particularly hard. According to the payroll processor ADP, about half the total jobs in the hotel and restaurant industry — 8.6 million — disappeared in April, based on data from its corporate clients. A category that includes retail and shipping shed 3.4 million workers.The difference between the 30 million-plus unemployment claims that have been filed in the past several weeks and the expected April job loss of slightly more than 20 million reflects differences in how the figures are compiled.The government calculates job losses by surveying businesses and households. It’s a net figure that also counts the hiring that some companies, like Amazon and many grocery stores, have done. By contrast, the total jobless claims are a cumulative figure; they include applications for unemployment aid that began in mid-March.In addition, the government conducts its surveys for the monthly jobs reports in the middle of each month. So layoffs from the final two weeks of April won’t show up in Friday’s jobs report. They will instead be included in the May jobs report to be released in early June.After problems with state computer systems had slowed the distribution of federal benefits for many laid-off workers, all 50 states are now paying the $600 extra weekly benefit that the federal government included in a relief package enacted in late March. That represents a significant help to millions of laid-off workers, many of whom still remain anxious and uncertain.Jamie Stewart is renting out a spare bedroom in her home to try to make ends meets after losing her job at a southwest Florida resort. Having applied for unemployment benefits in late March, she finally received her first payment of $1,200 this week. Stewart, a 37-year-old resident of Bonita Springs, works as a concierge in the off-season and as a shift manager and bartender in the resort’s restaurants.After her layoff, she deferred her car payment for two months and cancelled non-necessities like Zoom, Pandora and Netflix. She recently signed up for food stamps, which cover about half her monthly grocery bill.“My mental health has deteriorated to a point that I don’t recognize myself anymore,” she said. “My eyes are swollen and bloodshot all the time now from regular moments of weakness that leave me completely inconsolable.“It looks like I have aged 10 years since the lockdown started.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/33-million-have-sought-us-unemployment-aid-since-coronavirus-hit/story-wUEeyXYPrquXhxFPS0igTO.html
07-05-2020||World||China lowers Covid risk for country as President Xi warns against complacency||President Xi Jinping has warned against complacency in the ongoing fight to curb the coronavirus outbreak in the country even as China on Thursday classified all its counties as “low-risk” for the Covid-19 disease.The decision to lower the risk level was taken as no domestic cases were reported in the Chinese mainland for four consecutive days as of Wednesday, and no new deaths for 22 consecutive days, national health commission (NHC) spokesperson, Mi Feng said on Thursday.The Chinese mainland reported two new imported Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, bringing the total number of imported cases to 1,680, Mi added.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageChina now has a total of 82885 confirmed cases of the disease and 4633 deaths from it.Xi, however, warned officials from “relaxing” in their fight against it despite the dramatic fall in numbers at a meeting of the Communist Party of China’s Standing Committee, the top decision-making body in the country, on Wednesday.“Xi stressed that authorities can afford zero complacency in their work on all fronts to consolidate the outcomes of epidemic containment, and must not undo all the efforts that have been made,” state media quoted him as saying at the meeting.Xi said the spread of the “…virus overseas has not been effectively curbed yet and cluster cases were reported in a few areas in China, posing considerable uncertainty to the epidemic control”.The epidemic prevention and control measures in Hubei, the Chinese province worst-hit by the coronavirus, should not be relaxed, Xi said.Meanwhile, China’s diplomatic spat with the US continued on Thursday with the Chinese foreign ministry accusing US secretary of state Mike Pompeo of telling one lie to cover up another in his continued attacks against Beijing over the pandemic.Speaking at the regular ministry briefing on Thursday, spokesperson Hua Chunying said Beijing has been transparent about the Covid-19 outbreak that emerged in Hubei province’s capital Wuhan late last year and that the US politicians were making baseless accusations against ChinaWashington has accused Beijing of covering up the outbreak and mishandling it.Hua added that China supported the efforts of the WHO to investigate the origin of the pandemic.“We are always open to cooperate with the WHO on matters, including on the question of origin,” she said.“While scientists have not come to a conclusion, why is Secretary Pompeo drawing the hasty conclusion that the virus came from a Wuhan lab? Where is his proof? Show us the proof. If he cannot show any evidence, then he may still be in the process of making up this evidence,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-lowers-covid-risk-for-country-as-president-xi-warns-against-complacency/story-c4hb5gIILHTsa6tID9mkDN.html
07-05-2020||World||UK economy faces deepest recession as PM Boris Johnson mulls ease in curbs||Battered on various fronts, the UK economy faces a 14% shrink this year, registering the deepest recession since 1706, the Bank of England said on Thursday, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepared to announce some easing of lockdown curbs from Monday.Presenting century-wise data on the size of the British economy since 1700, the apex bank, however, said growth could bounce back to 15% for 2021 as a whole, with GDP recovering to its pre-coronavirus peak by the second half of next year.Andrew Bailey, the bank’s governor, said he expected any permanent damage from the pandemic to be relatively small, since the economy was likely to recover “much more rapidly than the pull back from the global financial crisis” of 2008.“The scale of the shock and the measures necessary to protect public health mean a significant loss of economic output has been inevitable in the near term,” he said.Referring to wage subsidy schemes announced by chancellor Rishi Sunak for the employed and the self-employed, Bailey said the success of these schemes and the bank’s own stimulus meant there would be “limited scarring to the economy”.Johnson is due to address the nation at 7 pm on Sunday on easing some lockdown measures from Monday, with ministers keen to re-start the economy. The main message to ‘stay at home’ is likely to be withdrawn with limited allowances for travel and gatherings.Scotland and Wales have separately announced their approaches about easing the measures. The two UK constituents and Northern Ireland have the power to diverge from measures announced by London, but there are efforts that the easing is applied uniformly across the UK. Johnson was due to chair a meet on the issue on Thrusday.A new official analysis by the Office for National Statistics said the risk of death from coronavirus among Indian and other non-white groups in the UK is “significantly higher” than those of white ethnicity, complementing similar reports from other sources.It said that Indian and other non-white males are 4.2 times more likely to die from a Covid-19-related death and non-white females are 4.3 times more likely than white ethnicity males and females. The UK’s Indian-origin population is estimated to number 1.5 million.Meanwhile, health officials said 4 lakh surgical gowns imported from Turkey did not meet UK standards and were unusable, adding to growing concerns over shortage in personal protective equipment (PPE). In Nottingham, Indian-origin Labour MP Nadia Whittome was dismissed as a carer for the elderly when she raised the issue of lack of PPE.The Department of Health and Social Care said: “We are working night and day to source PPE internationally and domestically and brought together the NHS, industry and the armed forces to create a comprehensive PPE distribution network to deliver critical supplies to the frontline”.“All deliveries of PPE are checked to ensure the equipment meets the safety and quality standards our frontline staff need. If equipment does not meet our specifications or pass our quality assurance processes it is not distributed to the front line.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-economy-faces-deepest-recession-as-pm-boris-johnson-mulls-ease-in-curbs/story-LTdY6FLJ3bpfkRZUvmexGK.html
07-05-2020||World||China slams US after Trump virus ‘attack’ claim||China accused the United States on Thursday of trying to shift blame over the coronavirus, after President Donald Trump said the pandemic was a worse “attack” than Pearl Harbor or 9/11.Tension between the world’s two biggest economies has reached fever pitch in recent days as they have exchanged barbed comments on each other’s handling of the virus.“We urge the US side to stop shifting the blame to China and turn to facts,” said foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying at a press briefing.On Wednesday Trump drew analogies with the virus, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year, and infamous military and terrorist attacks on the United States. “This is really the worst attack we’ve ever had,” Trump told reporters. “This is worse than Pearl Harbor. This is worse than the World Trade Center.”The Japanese assault on the Pearl Harbor naval base in Hawaii drew the United States into World War II.The September 11, 2001 jihadist attacks on that killed about 3,000 people and triggered two decades of war.Trump said the coronavirus pandemic “should never have happened”.“Could have been stopped at the source. Could have been stopped in China,” he said.Hua responded: “They might say the pandemic is comparable to Pearl Harbor or 9/11, but the enemy facing the US is the novel coronavirus”.She said Washington should “fight side-by-side” with Beijing instead of as “enemies”.Hua added that “lots of foreign countries, experts and scientists have all made positive comments on China’s effective virus prevention and control.”“But the US alone has made some very disharmonious, untruthful and insincere remarks,” said Hua.The coronavirus, which first emerged in central China late last year, has now killed more than 73,000 people in the US.lxc-rox/lth/kma||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-slams-us-after-trump-virus-attack-claim/story-Ekdrzx2XjJtGJsarb1F88M.html
07-05-2020||World||Covid-19 transmission risk via sewage must not be neglected: Scientists||Environmental scientists have warned that the potential spread of Covid-19 via sewage “must not be neglected” since the viruses shed from the digestive system of infected individuals tend to last longer than those from the respiratory tract. The research, published in the journal Environmental International, noted that while response to pandemic is focused on preventing person-to-person transmission, the virus might also spread in wastewater. “It has recently been confirmed that the virus can also be found in human faeces -- up to 33 days after the patient has tested negative for the respiratory symptoms of Covid-19,” said Richard Quilliam, study co-author from the University of Stirling in Scotland. Based on their new findings, the scientists warned that the sewerage system itself may pose a transmission risk. They said the structural makeup of SARS-CoV-2, specifically its lipid envelope covering, suggests that it will behave differently in aqueous environments, compared to other viruses typically found in the intestine. There is currently limited information on the environmental persistence of Covid-19, but the study noted that other coronaviruses can remain viable in sewage for up to 14 days, depending on the environmental conditions. “It is not yet known whether the virus can be transmitted via the faecal-oral route, however, we know that viral shedding from the digestive system can last longer than shedding from the respiratory tract,” Qulliam said. Hence he said the fecal-oral route could be an important -- but as yet unquantified -- pathway for increased exposure. Quilliam said since most Covid-19 patients are asymptomatic or experience just mild symptoms and remain at home, there is significant risk of “widespread” distribution through sewers. According to the biologists, lack of testing “makes it difficult” to predict the scale of the potential spread and the public health implications of the virus arriving at wastewater treatment works. “The transport of coronaviruses in water could increase the potential for the virus to become aerosolised, particularly during the pumping of wastewater through sewerage systems, at the wastewater treatment works,” the scientists wrote in the study. According to the study, the risk of fecal-oral transmission could be further increased in parts of the world with high levels of open defecation, or where safely managed sanitation systems are limited. In these places, the scientists said waterways are used as both open sewers and sources of water for domestic purposes. “Such settings are commonly accompanied by poorly resourced and fragile healthcare systems, thus amplifying both exposure risk and potential mortality,” the researchers noted. Currently, all published data on faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 derive from hospitalised patients with limited information on mild and asymptomatic cases, they added. “In the immediate future, there needs to be an investment of resources to improve our understanding of the risks associated with faecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and whether this respiratory virus can be disseminated by enteric transmission,” the study concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-transmission-risk-via-sewage-must-not-be-neglected-scientists/story-WEAbcuxkodZL90cADtzZGN.html
07-05-2020||World||UK to review easing of coronavirus lockdown||The British government was on Thursday reviewing lockdown measures introduced to combat the coronavirus outbreak, with a partial easing expected to be announced this weekend.Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets Cabinet colleagues, with predictions that unlimited exercise and picnics will soon be allowed as part of the first step of easing restrictions.“We’ll want if we possibly can to get going with some of these measures on Monday. I think it would be a good thing if people had an idea of what is coming,” he said Wednesday.Pubs and cafes with gardens may also be allowed to open but people would be required to remain two metres (six feet) apart.But the government and its scientific advisers have warned not to expect a return to normality for months, with Britain’s mortality figures the highest in Europe.“The messaging will evolve from stay at home to be careful when you’re out,” an unnamed minister told the Daily Telegraph.Offices will have to stagger arrivals and separate staff with screens, while meetings will continue to take place remotely when possible, according to the paper.“In engineering, car manufacturing, textiles and construction, where social distancing can be implemented, then workers will be encouraged back to the factory floor,” a minister told the paper.- ‘Second spike’ -Britain has now recorded 30,076 deaths from coronavirus, the highest in Europe, although each country has a different method of recording its official toll.Broader data, however, puts the number at above 32,000.Johnson said last week that Britain had past the peak of the outbreak, the daily death toll was falling and the infection rate dropping below one -- meaning each person with the disease is passing it on to less than one person.But he also warned against the risk of a “second spike”, and hinted at a gradual rollback of restrictions.Schools will only open “when the time is right”, minister Robert Jenrick said Wednesday, with pupils studying for major exams expected to be the first to return. Families could also be allowed to see each other using “bubble” arrangements, the Telegraph said, under which people would meet with a small number of chosen friends and family.The system has already been floated by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who sits on the emergency contingencies committee that decides country-wide policies.The government has said testing will form a crucial plank of easing lockdown measures but is facing questions after failing to hit its 100,000 a day target for four days in a row.Johnson said on Wednesday that “capacity currently exceeds demand”, and set a new target of 200,000 a day “by the end of this month”.jwp/phz/wdb||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-review-easing-of-coronavirus-lockdown/story-UuEY8Ha84vrkMKgXVWXp3I.html
07-05-2020||World||Japan set to approve Gilead’s Remdesivir drug to treat virus||Japan is set to approve on Thursday the antiviral drug remdesivir for use against the novel coronavirus, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said.The rapid move by Japan’s usually conservative authorities comes days after the U.S. authorized Gilead Sciences Inc.’s drug for emergency use on virus patients. Special approval in Japan is reserved for urgent situations, where there is no alternative, and the drug has already been authorized for use overseas.Finding a treatment for Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, could move the world closer to easing lockdown measures put in place to help slow its spread. One early analysis showed that about two-thirds of severe Covid-19 cases improved when treated with the drug, according to a report published in April.Multiple trials of remdesivir are still under way. In April, the World Health Organization prematurely published results of a China trial by accident but retracted it soon after. The WHO post indicated that the drug didn’t show benefits in preventing death and reducing virus load, but the Chinese trial was halted early after researchers struggled to enroll patients.While the virus has so far wreaked less health damage in Japan than the U.S. or some European countries, the economy has taken a severe hit. Abe has said treatments and vaccines are needed to help restore economic and social activities.Typically, for a drug to be approved in Japan, the government requires clinical trials to include Japanese patients, or for a new trial to be done in Japan, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Caroline Stewart, who covers the pharmaceutical industry. While doubt remains over its efficacy, “it’s better than nothing,” she added.Health Minister Katsunobu Kato had said earlier in the week that the panel charged with deciding on remdesivir’s approval was to meet Thursday and that the process would be completed as soon as possible.Earlier this month, Japan’s Health Ministry said in a message to local governments that even if remdesivir is approved, supplies may be limited and will be controlled by the central government.More than 15,000 people have been confirmed as infected with the virus in Japan, and more than 500 have died, although experts say the relatively small number of tests conducted means there are probably more undetected cases.Japan has extended its nationwide state of emergency until May 31, with Abe saying the country’s coronavirus measures need more time to reduce infection rates. The state of emergency allows local governments to direct businesses to close and to urge residents to stay in their homes.Abe Extends Japan Emergency Through May in Bid to Slow VirusAbe said Monday he’s aiming to have Avigan, an antiviral drug developed by Fujifilm Holdings Corp., approved for use as a Covid-19 treatment by the end of this month. He added in the live streamed internet interview late Wednesday that trials were also beginning with an anti-parasite drug known as ivermectin, developed by Nobel prize-laureate Satoshi Omura.(Updates to add the type of approval)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-set-to-approve-gilead-s-remdesivir-drug-to-treat-virus/story-siifv4iVjQ3751dX2yCEiM.html
07-05-2020||World||Former Vatican official Pell knew of child sex abuse for decades: Report||Cardinal George Pell was aware of child sexual abuse by Catholic clergy in Australia as far back as the 1970s and failed to seek the removal of accused priests, according to findings of a top-level inquiry released Thursday.The Royal Commission report was handed down in 2017 but pages relating to Pell’s conduct were heavily redacted to prevent jurors in his trials on child sex abuse allegations from being prejudiced.Australia’s High Court last month acquitted the former Vatican treasurer of all charges and freed him from jail, allowing the release of findings relating to Pell from the Royal Commission into institutional child sex abuse.The commission found that Pell, when he was a priest in the rural diocese of Ballarat in Victoria state, had begun considering in 1973 the “prudence” of now-jailed child sex abuser Gerald Ridsdale taking boys on overnight camping trips.“By this time, child sexual abuse was on his radar,” the commission said.“We are also satisfied that by 1973 Cardinal Pell was not only conscious of child sexual abuse by clergy but that he also had considered measures of avoiding situations which might provoke gossip about it.”The commission found it was “likely that he knew of Ridsdale’s sexual transgressions” when Pell joined a meeting about moving the priest to another parish in 1977.Pell, who lived with Ridsdale in 1973 and supported him at his first court appearance in 1993, has insisted he had no memory of claims of sustained mistreatment in Ballarat.The commission also found that Pell should have sought the removal of another priest, Father Peter Searson, after receiving a list of complaints from a delegation of teachers in 1989 when Pell was auxiliary bishop in Melbourne.‘Unpleasant, strange, aggressive’Searson was the subject of “numerous” complaints between the 1970s and 1990s including child sexual abuse and his “unpleasant, strange, aggressive and violent conduct”, the commission said.Though Pell conceded he could have been “a bit more pushy” in recommending a course of action to the archbishop, the commission found it had been “incumbent on Pell” to act in 1989 but he did not stand down Searson until 1997.Searson pleaded guilty that year to physically assaulting a child but was never charged with sexual abuse. He died in 2009.When the Royal Commission was announced in 2012, Pell -- then the archbishop of Sydney -- called the extent of abuse in the Catholic Church “exaggerated”.The inquiry heard that there were more than 4,000 alleged victims of paedophilia in religious institutions, and in some Catholic dioceses more than 15 percent of priests were perpetrators.Repeatedly questioned during hearings about the Ballarat diocese in the 1970s and 80s, Pell apologised on behalf of the church and did admit he “mucked up” in dealing with paedophile priests in the 1970s.However, he said he was deceived by senior clergy about what was happening during a time of “crimes and cover-ups”.Pell, 78, spent more than a year in prison after convicted in December 2018 of sexually abusing two choirboys in the 1990s when he was the archbishop of Melbourne. He had strenuously denied the charges and was later acquitted by the High Court in a second appeal against the conviction.However, Pell is still facing a civil suit brought by the father of one of choirboys, who died in 2014.“In my view, his position as Australia’s highest-ranking representative in the Catholic Church should be reviewed based on his choice to protect paedophiles over innocent children, at the time the abuse occurred,” said Lisa Flynn, the deceased man’s lawyer.In Good Faith Foundation, an abuse recovery group, said the report showed there were “numerous opportunities” for Pell to have acted throughout his time with the Church.“At each point he appeared to show more regard for trying to maintain a shroud of ignorance, than protecting the most vulnerable in our communities,” it said in a statement.“These findings ultimately highlight one simple fact: George Pell has always known more than he’s claimed and done less than he should have.”A spokeswoman for Pell and the Catholic diocese in Sydney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-vatican-official-pell-knew-of-child-sex-abuse-for-decades-report/story-WdRjK0cjqm8yqKSyLsL2pI.html

Punjab and Sindh, the two worst-hit provinces, have also announced some relaxation in lockdown by allowing reopening of few businesses like garment/cloth, shoes, automobile and spare parts.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

07-05-2020||World||Closest black hole to Earth has two partners in surprising celestial marriage||Astronomers have spotted the closest black hole to Earth ever discovered and are surprised about its living arrangements - residing harmoniously with two stars in a remarkable celestial marriage that may end in a nasty breakup.The black hole, at least 4.2 times the mass of the sun, is gravitationally bound to two stars in a so-called triple system roughly 1,000 light years from Earth, researchers said on Wednesday. “Just around the corner” in cosmic terms, said Chile-based European Southern Observatory astronomer Thomas Rivinius, lead author of the study published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).Black holes are extraordinarily dense objects possessing gravitational pulls so powerful that not even light can escape. Some are monstrous like the one at our galaxy’s center 26,000 light years from Earth that is four million times the sun’s mass. Garden variety so-called stellar-mass black holes like the newly discovered one have the mass of a single star. This one probably began its life as a star up to 20 times the sun’s mass that collapsed into a black hole at the end of its relatively short lifespan. This triple system, called HR 6819, can be seen from Earth’s southern hemisphere with the naked eye, in the constellation Telescopium. Until now, the closest-known black hole was one perhaps three times further away.Only a few dozen stellar-mass black holes previously were known. But there may be hundreds of millions or even a billion of them in the Milky Way, said astrophysicist and study co-author Petr Hadrava of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.This black hole, detected using an observatory in Chile, is minding its manners and has not shredded its two partners: stars about five or six times the mass of the sun. At least not yet.“The formation of a black hole is a violent process, and most models would not have predicted a triple system could survive that but rather would fly apart,” Rivinius said.The black hole forms a pair with one of the two stars, as near to one another as the Earth is to the sun. The other star is much further away, orbiting the pair. This star spins so rapidly that it is misshapen, bulging at the equator.The two stars are sufficiently distant from the black hole that it is not pulling material from them. But in a few million years the closer star is expected to grow in size as part of its life cycle.“What happens then is uncertain,” Rivinius said. “The most spectacular outcome would be if the black hole ends up with that star inside it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/closest-black-hole-to-earth-has-two-partners-in-surprising-celestial-marriage/story-u70GTTq77WaxhwMGMYIZQM.html

China on Thursday downgraded Covid-19 risk levels in all regions, signalling its successful containment.Addressing a meeting of the central guiding group for novel coronavirus prevention and control on Thursday, Xi said the spread of the virus overseas has not been effectively curbed yet and cluster cases were reported in a few areas in China, posing considerable uncertainty to the epidemic control.“The country must get ready for unprecedented external adversity and challenges in the long run over Covid-19 crisis,” the Chinese President said.“The epidemic prevention and control measures in Hubei should not be relaxed,” he added.China has already reduced risk levels in Hubei province and its capital Wuhan - the epicentres of the virus, while business and factories across the country have resumed operations.China’s National Health Commission (NHC) on Thursday said that two imported cases were detected, and there was no domestically transmitted Covid-19 case.Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, which were free from new coronavirus cases for the last 33 days, reported six asymptomatic cases on Wednesday, taking the total number of such patients in the province to 626, the local health commission said.The total number of asymptomatic patients in the country now stands at 880.Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested Covid-19 positive but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. However, they pose a risk of spreading the disease to others.The total number of COVID-19 cases in China now stands at 82,885, the NHC said.Last month, China had announced to hold its annual Parliament session from May 22, signalling that the pandemic which paralysed the country for over three months is finally under control.The session was earlier scheduled to be held from March 5 and got postponed for the first time due to the coronavirus outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-china-lowers-covid-19-risk-level-president-xi-jinping-says-don-t-be-complacent/story-TvxMaj03GVDOFS19COwSbO.html
07-05-2020||World||New York’s ‘lifeline’ subway halts 24-hour service||For the first time since 1904, New York’s famed subway has halted its all-night service as the coronavirus outbreak brings “the city that never sleeps” to its knees.The closures from 1:00 am to 5:00 am are aimed at eliminating traces of the potentially fatal virus from the subway’s 6,500 wagons -- using every cleaning technique from basic sanitizer to ultra-violet lamps.Authorities say conditions in New York -- the epicenter of the pandemic, with more than 19,000 confirmed or probable deaths -- are slowly improving, but that it’s too soon to relax confinement measures.For Gary Dennis, a New York tour guide in love with his city, its 424 subway stations and their gray carriages -- clunky and loud but as iconic as the Statue of Liberty or the bright yellow taxis -- the state of the transit system is a thermometer for the health of the metropolis.Dennis, a 59-year-old who lives on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, said the city’s decision to shutter service overnight left him “upset.”“This is a 24-hour town,” he told AFP. “It’s not designed to be empty, it’s designed to be crowded.”“Without the subway, this town would die.”Mayor Bill de Blasio also describes the complex train system that snakes through the city as a “lifeline” that keeps New York’s 8.6 million residents chugging along.Since the pandemic hit the city, ridership has plummeted by more than 90 percent, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that manages the network, to less than 500,000 passengers a day.Normally some 5.5 million people take the subway every day.With many white-collar workers logging into the office from home, most riders are now “essential” workers -- some 800,000 employees of hospitals, supermarkets, repair personnel and delivery workers, many of them black or Latino, some undocumented migrants.And controversy has grown over homeless people seeking overnight shelter in train cars. The city hopes closure will encourage them to find alternative shelter, but many advocacy groups have warned it will worsen the homeless crisis.‘Giant vectors of this virus’Witnessing the deserted subway stations leaves Will Ramos, a plumber and handyman, mourning the loss of “culture within the stations.”“You meet a lot of talent down here,” the 33-year-old said at the Union Square station, one of the network’s largest.But the pandemic has transformed the underground into “giant vectors of this virus,” in the words of conductor Sujatha Gidla, who contracted the COVID-19 illness.In a scathing open letter published this week in The New York Times, Gidla denounced precautions taken to protect MTA workers as too little too late, saying “essential” staff were treated as “expendable.”According to the MTA’s president Patrick Foye, 109 of 50,000 workers have died after contracting the virus.The subway system -- much of it devastated by Superstorm Sandy in 2012 -- was already undergoing costly renovations, a project deemed urgent after years of negligence.Now experts estimate the transit authority could lose $4-8 billion due to the pandemic. Both the city and state of New York have seen tax revenues in free fall as the economy stalls and unemployment soars -- and few expect Donald Trump’s White House to take pity on the transportation system of his home city.“The funding challenge will be huge,” said Bruce Schaller, the former deputy commissionner for traffic and planning at city’s transportation department.“It is very daunting.”But the public transit consultant doesn’t doubt the subway will weather the storm.In the 1970s the transportation network was in dire condition, wracked with crime. But Schaller says the city is far from that situation, when the city “as a whole was badly ailing.”Today, the question is “not about the longer-term vitality” for the subway, but about getting through the pandemic, he said.And emerging is vital, according to Schaller: “The fundamental assumption in New York is that you have mass transit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-s-lifeline-subway-halts-24-hour-service/story-AyZtzXuojSw9OEJ6t8cm3O.html
07-05-2020||World||India expected to have highest births since Covid declared as pandemic: Report||India is projected to record the highest number of births in the 9 months since Covid-19 was declared a pandemic in March, with more than 20 million babies expected to be born in the country between March and December, according to a top UN body. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) warned that pregnant mothers and babies born during the pandemic across the world were threatened by strained health systems and disruptions in services.An estimated 116 million babies will be born under the shadow of Covid-19 pandemic, UNICEF said on Wednesday, ahead of Mother’s Day, observed on May 10.These babies are projected to be born up to 40 weeks after Covid-19 was recognised as a pandemic on March 11.The highest numbers of births in the 9 months since the pandemic was declared are expected to occur in India, where 20.1 million babies are projected to be born between March 11 and December 16. Other countries with the expected highest numbers of births during this period are China (13.5 million), Nigeria (6.4 million), Pakistan (5 million) and Indonesia (4 million), it said.“Most of these countries had high neonatal mortality rates even before the pandemic and may see these levels increase with Covid-19 conditions,” UNICEF said. It is estimated that there will be 24.1 million births in India for the January-December 2020 period. UNICEF warned that Covid-19 containment measures can disrupt life-saving health services such as childbirth care, putting millions of pregnant mothers and their babies at great risk. Even wealthier countries are affected by this crisis. In the US, the sixth highest country in terms of expected number of births, over 3.3 million babies are projected to be born between March 11 and December 16. “New mothers and newborns will be greeted by harsh realities,” UNICEF said, adding they include global containment measures such as lockdowns and curfews; health centres overwhelmed with response efforts; supply and equipment shortages; and a lack of sufficient skilled birth attendants as health workers, including midwives, are redeployed to treat Covid-19 patients.“Millions of mothers all over the world embarked on a journey of parenthood in the world as it was. They now must prepare to bring a life into the world as it has become – a world where expecting mothers are afraid to go to health centres for fear of getting infected, or missing out on emergency care due to strained health services and lockdowns,” UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said. “It is hard to imagine how much the coronavirus pandemic has recast motherhood” Fore said.UNICEF said its analysis was based on data from World Population Prospects 2019 of the UN Population Division. An average full-term pregnancy typically lasts a complete 9 months, or 39 to 40 weeks. For the purposes of this estimate, the number of births for a 40-week period in 2020 was calculated. The 40-week period of March 11 to December 16 is used in this estimate based upon the WHO’s March 11 assessment that Covid-19 can be characterised as a pandemic. UNICEF warned that although evidence suggests that pregnant mothers are not more affected by Covid-19 than others, countries need to ensure they still have access to antenatal, delivery and postnatal services. Similarly, sick newborns need emergency services as they are at high risk of death. New families require support to start breastfeeding, and to get medicines, vaccines and nutrition to keep their babies healthy, it said.“This is a particularly poignant Mother’s Day, as many families have been forced apart during the coronavirus pandemic, but it is also a time for unity, a time to bring everyone together in solidarity. We can help save lives by making sure that every pregnant mother receives the support she needs to give birth safely in the months to come,” Fore said. Issuing an urgent appeal to governments and health care providers to save lives in the coming months, UNICEF said efforts must be made to help pregnant women receive antenatal checkups, skilled delivery care, postnatal care services, and care related to Covid-19 as needed.Ensure health workers are provided with the necessary personal protective equipment and get priority testing and vaccination once a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available so that can deliver high quality care to all pregnant women and newborn babies during the pandemic, it said. While it is not yet known whether the virus is transmitted from a mother to her baby during pregnancy and delivery, UNICEF advised all pregnant women to follow precautions to protect themselves from exposure to the virus.Closely monitor themselves for symptoms of Covid-19 and seek advice from the nearest designated facility if they have concerns or experience symptoms. Pregnant women should also take the same precautions to avoid COVID -19 infection as other people: practice physical distancing, avoid physical gatherings and use online health services, it said. UNICEF said even before Covid-19 pandemic, an estimated 2.8 million pregnant women and newborns died every year, or 1 every 11 seconds, mostly of preventable causes. The agency called for immediate investment in health workers with the right training, who are equipped with the right medicines to ensure every mother and newborn is cared for by a safe pair of hands to prevent and treat complications during pregnancy, delivery and birth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-expected-to-have-highest-births-since-covid-declared-as-pandemic-report/story-cjceKCa9f6O4AYeNC24e0L.html
07-05-2020||World||Search for Covid-19 origin heats up as WHO seeks mission to China||The World Health Organization is considering a new mission to seek the source of the coronavirus in China, amid growing controversy over the origin of a pandemic that has killed more than a quarter of a million people.“Without knowing where the animal origin is, it’s hard to prevent it from happening again,” Maria Van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist, said at a press briefing Wednesday. “There is discussion with our counterparts in China for a further mission, which would be more academic in focus, and really focus on looking at what happened at the beginning in terms of exposures with different animals,” she added.Van Kerkhove in February participated in a previous mission to China, which concluded that the virus was zoonotic in origin. Bats appeared to be the “reservoir” for the virus, but an intermediate host could not be determined, the report said.Talk of a new mission comes as debate grows over the source of the outbreak, which was first identified in Wuhan, China, more than four months ago. US President Donald Trump‘s administration has said the virus likely escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which runs a laboratory that studies dangerous pathogens. Some intelligence agencies are casting doubt on that theory, and China has repeatedly denied the claim.The WHO has come under fire from Trump, who has moved to cut off funding to the Geneva-based United Nations agency, saying it was overly deferential to China as the virus spread in that country and beyond. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo on Wednesday asserted that China covered up the origins of the virus even as he eased off earlier claims of “enormous evidence” that the virus escaped from a Wuhan laboratory.Pompeo repeated the US allegation that China is still refusing to share virus samples or details about the start of the pandemic and on “patient zero,” the first victim. And he said other countries are starting to see it the US way.“Our truth-telling and calls for transparency aren’t about politics, it’s not about bullying, it’s not about blame,” Pompeo said. “It’s about the ongoing need to save American lives. This is an ongoing threat.”China’s foreign ministry didn’t immediately reply to questions about the WHO’s proposed mission. On Wednesday, in response to calls from the likes of Australia and the European Union for investigations into how the previously unknown pathogen made the jump from animals to humans, ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that China would support a review about the origins of the virus at an “appropriate time.”“We will continue supporting the WHO and support looking back and summarizing the experience at an appropriate time to support global health cooperation and so we can better deal with pandemics like this in the future,” Hua said at a briefing in Beijing. “What we oppose is the presumption of guilt under the pretext of an investigation, or using the epidemic for political purposes.”Hua also dismissed Pompeo’s claims the virus escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan.Xi Seeks Reform“Mr. Pompeo cannot present any evidence because he does not have any,” Hua said. “This matter should be handled by scientists and professionals instead of politicians out of their domestic political needs.”China has come under fire over its early handling of the virus, which has pushed the global economy toward recession as it spreads around the world. Authorities had reprimanded doctors including Li Wenliang, who later passed away, for sharing warnings about the coronavirus infection risk in WeChat groups in late December.President Xi Jinping called for reform of China’s disease control system at a meeting of the Politburo on Wednesday, an apparent acknowledgment of lapses in the nation’s response. The country’s top leaders agreed to boost epidemic monitoring and early-warning capabilities, revamp public health emergency laws and regulations and enhance the response to major epidemics, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/search-for-covid-19-origin-heats-up-as-who-seeks-mission-to-china/story-iXZGO74pctP8ryEotx5oFJ.html
07-05-2020||World||United Nations appeals for $4.7 billion dollars more to combat coronavirus||The United Nations on Thursday issued a new appeal for $4.7 billion in funding to “protect millions of lives and stem the spread of coronavirus in fragile countries.” The money is on top of the $2 billion the UN already called for when it launched its global humanitarian response plan on March 25. It has received about half of that money so far.“The most devastating and destabilizing effects” of the novel coronavirus pandemic “will be felt in the world’s poorest countries,” UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock said in the statement.“Unless we take action now, we should be prepared for a significant rise in conflict, hunger and poverty. The spectre of multiple famines looms,” he warned.The full $6.7 billion is expected to cover costs of the humanitarian response plan until December.It prioritizes some 20 countries, including several in conflict such as Afghanistan and Syria.The new call for donations came as nine more countries were added to the list: Benin, Djibouti, Liberia, Mozambique, Pakistan, Philippines, Sierra Leone, Togo and Zimbabwe. The funds are to be used to buy medical equipment to test and treat the sick, provide hand-washing stations, launch information campaigns and establish humanitarian airlifts to Africa, Asia and Latin America, according to the UN. It also aims to develop new programs to better combat food insecurity that is growing as a result of the economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. “Extraordinary measures are needed,” Lowcock stressed. “I urge donors to act in both solidarity and in self-interest and make their response proportionate to the scale of the problem we face,” he added, warning of a long-term boomerang effect if poor countries are neglected by rich countries.Covid-19 infections are expected to peak in the world’s poorest countries in the next three to six months, according to UN estimates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-nations-appeals-for-4-7-billion-dollars-more-to-combat-coronavirus/story-csHDewZI5qbw8BVXWfqLzI.html

It is normally issued to those who have already started the process of seeking employment-based lawful permanent resident status.Also Read: US eases norms, H-1B holders, Green Card applicants get 60-day grace periodThe DHS, in its submission on May 5, said the argument by Save Jobs USA on behalf of American technology workers “only speculates about potential economic harm to its members, based on five-year-old affidavits”.In its lawsuit filed in 2015, Save Jobs USA had argued that the regulation issued by the Obama administration to provide employment authorisation for certain H4 dependent spouses harms their members, who are American technology workers.After coming to power, the Trump administration in December 2017 informed the court that it plans to rescind the Obama-era regulations in this regard. Since then, it told the court about half-a-dozen times about its intention to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). However, the DHS has not rescinded “Employment Authorisation for Certain H-4 Dependent Spouses” of 2015.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe DHS’s court submission was in response to the one by Save Jobs USA, which sought a preliminary injunction to stop the H-4 rule from providing qualifying H-4 visa-holders with temporary employment authorisation. Save Jobs USA had argued that the longer the case remains in abeyance, greater the harm to US workers. The DHS disagreed, asserting that there is no such indication.In an 11-page argument, the DHS asserted that Save Jobs USA failed to establish that its members’ speculative economic injuries were sufficient to satisfy the DC Circuit’s “high standard for irreparable injury”.The claim of irreparable harm by Save Jobs USA relied on the H-4 rule eliminating or significantly reducing employment opportunities, meaning that the number of available information-technology jobs would significantly decline due to the H-4 rule, it said.“But this relationship has not been shown to be ‘certain’ and ‘actual’, rather than merely ‘theoretical’,” the DHS argued.As such the DHS urged the court to deny the motion of Save Jobs USA, seeking a preliminary injunction enjoining the H-4 rule. Save Jobs USA had sought a stay on the H-4 ruling.An H-4 visa is issued to the spouses of H-1B visa holders, a significantly large number of whom are high-skilled professionals from India. They had obtained work permits under a special order issued by the previous Obama administration in 2015.As of December 2017, the USCIS had approved 1,26,853 applications for employment authorisation for H-4 visa-holders. According to a 2018 report by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), 93 per cent of approved applications for H-4 employment authorisation were issued to individuals born in India and five per cent to individuals born in China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-govt-asks-court-not-to-block-work-permits-to-spouses-of-h-1b-visa-holders/story-ACfGaAie1yBvi7W0FSxECP.html
07-05-2020||World||‘Very insulting’: Trump vetoes measure limiting his war powers in Iran||US President Donald Trump on Wednesday vetoed what he called a “very insulting” congressional resolution seeking to limit his war powers in Iran.In a statement, Trump said he had used his veto because the resolution -- a rare bipartisan rebuke to the president approved in March -- was based on “misunderstandings of facts and law.”The measure stemmed from fears among both Trump’s Republicans and Democrats that the White House was stumbling into war with the Islamic republic.In the statement, Trump says Congress misinterpreted his constitutional authority as being limited to “defense of the United States and its forces against imminent attack.”“That is incorrect,” he said. “We live in a hostile world of evolving threats, and the Constitution recognizes that the President must be able to anticipate our adversaries’ next moves and take swift and decisive action in response. That’s what I did!”The resolution said the US president cannot commit his military to hostilities against Iran or any part of its government or military without explicit authorization from Congress.Supporters said they wanted to ensure that Congress had the unique power to declare war, as outlined in the US Constitution. Trump has preached the need for a drawdown of American military entanglements abroad, but has ramped up a hostile relationship with Iran.His administration has imposed crippling economic sanctions on Tehran. In January, Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Iran’s most powerful general, Qassem Soleimani, at the Baghdad airport.The assassination has inflamed tensions between the two countries.Soleimani was widely seen as the architect of destabilizing activities by Iran around the world, but Democrats and many experts condemned the decision to kill him as disproportionate and provocative. Tehran retaliated with a strike against bases used by the US military in Iraq without causing any fatalities, easing fears of a dramatic escalation. The Trump administration claims it has put Iran back in its box. But a recent verbal escalation following an incident between US ships and Iranian speedboats in the Gulf showed that tensions remain high. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine hit out at Trump for blocking the resolution. “I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to override his veto -- Congress must vote before sending our troops into harm’s way,” he tweeted.To override a veto, two-thirds of the members of both houses of Congress must vote to do so -- unlikely, given the Republican majority in the Senate.It is the second time Trump has vetoed an attempt by Congress to control his military initiatives.In 2019, he blocked an resolution to end US support for Saudi Arabia’s offensive in Yemen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/very-insulting-trump-vetoes-measure-limiting-his-war-powers-in-iran/story-Ob8A6Sq1TieKrHsMwYqOdO.html

07-05-2020||World||UN confirms Russian mercenaries are fighting in Libya: diplomats||Mercenaries from the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organization seen as being close to Vladimir Putin, are fighting in Libya, UN diplomats said Wednesday, citing an experts’ report on the country’s arms embargo.It is the first time the UN has confirmed claims first made in US media that the group is supporting military strongman Khalifa Haftar. Moscow has denied being responsible for deploying the group. The Wagner Group is a shadowy private security firm and thousands of its contractors are believed to be in foreign conflicts from Syria to Ukraine to the Central African Republic.A senior US State Department official has told AFP the group is “an instrument of the Kremlin’s policy” in Libya. “The Panel has identified the presence of private military operatives from ChVK Wagner in Libya since October 2018,” the UN report says, according to several diplomats who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity as the document has not yet been made public.“Wagner has been providing technical support for the repair of military vehicles, participating in combat operations and engaging in influence operations,” the UN report says.They are also involved in “more specialized military tasks such as acting as artillery Forward Observation Officers and Forward Air Controllers, providing electronic countermeasures expertise and deploying as sniper teams,” it continued. “Their deployment has acted as an effective force multiplier” for Haftar, it said.The experts said they could not independently verify how many Wagner mercenaries were in Libya, but estimated their deployment at between 800 and 1,200.The report, submitted on April 24 to the UN Security Council, however says that there are tensions between Wagner and Haftar’s command. The text is an update of the expert panel’s last annual report from December, which had noted the existence of foreign armed groups from Chad and Sudan in the conflict, but did not mention Wagner.It also confirms the presence of another private Russian security company, Rossiskie System Bezopasnosti (RSB) Group, saying they are “providing maintenance and repair support for military aircraft.”But it says observers are still investigating claims that two other organizations -- Moran Security Group and Schit Security Group -- are involved.Pro-Haftar forces have been battling to seize the capital Tripoli from the internationally-recognized government of national accord (GNA) since April 2019.Foreign military involvement has exacerbated the conflict, with the United Arab Emirates and Russia backing Haftar and Ankara supplying the GNA.A January truce brokered by Turkey and Russia has been repeatedly violated.Wagner’s involvement in the conflict was first revealed by The New York Times and The Washington Post last year. The former put their numbers at 200, while the latter said it could be as high as several thousand.The UN report does not recommend sanctions against the groups or any action to prevent their involvement. A report by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres submitted to the Security Council on Tuesday and obtained by AFP also mentioned foreign mercenaries but did not identify them or recommend any action against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-confirms-russian-mercenaries-are-fighting-in-libya-diplomats/story-AtO1O5fFoqQvgJYMh87xlI.html
07-05-2020||World||‘If this thing boomerangs’: Second wave of Covid-19 infections feared||As Europe and the US loosen their lockdowns against the coronavirus, health experts are expressing growing dread over what they say is an all-but-certain second wave of deaths and infections that could force governments to clamp back down.“We are risking a backslide that will be intolerable,” said Dr Ian Lipkin of Columbia University’s Center for Infection and Immunity.Around the world, German authorities began drawing up plans in case of a resurgence of the virus. Experts in Italy urged intensified efforts to identify new victims and trace their contacts. And France, which has not yet eased its lockdown, has already worked up a “reconfinement plan” in the event of a new wave.“There will be a second wave, but the problem is to which extent. Is it a small wave or a big wave? It is too early to say,” said Olivier Schwartz, head of the virus unit at France’s Pasteur Institute.In the US, with about half of the states easing their shutdowns to get their economies restarted and cellphone data showing that people are becoming restless and increasingly leaving home, public health authorities are worried.Many states have not put in place the robust testing that experts believe is necessary to detect and contain new outbreaks. And many governors have pressed ahead before their states met one of the key benchmarks in the Trump administration’s guidelines for reopening -- a 14-day downward trajectory in new illnesses and infections.“If we relax these measures without having the proper public health safeguards in place, we can expect many more cases and, unfortunately, more deaths,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy with the Kaiser Family Foundation in Washington.Cases have continued to rise steadily in places such as Iowa and Missouri since the governors began reopening, while new infections have yo-yoed in Georgia, Tennessee and Texas.Lipkin said he is most worried about two things: the reopening of bars, where people crowd together and lose their inhibitions, and large gatherings such as sporting events, concerts and plays. Preventing outbreaks will require aggressive contact tracing powered by armies of public health workers hundreds of thousands of people strong, which the US does not yet have, Lipkin said.Worldwide the virus has infected more than 36 lakh people and killed over a quarter-million, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that experts agree understates the dimensions of the disaster because of limited testing, differences in counting the dead and concealment by some governments.The US has recorded over 70,000 deaths and 12 lakh confirmed infections, while Europe has reported over 140,000 dead.This week, the researchers behind a widely cited model from the University of Washington nearly doubled their projection of deaths in the US to around 134,000 through early August, in large part because of the easing of state stay-at-home restrictions. Newly confirmed infections per day in the US exceed 20,000 and deaths per day are running well over 1,000.In hard-hit New York City, which has managed to bring down deaths dramatically even as confirmed infections continue to rise around the rest of the country, Mayor Bill de Blasio warned that some states may be reopening too quickly.“My message to the rest of the country is learn from how much effort, how much discipline it took to finally bring these numbers down and follow the same path until you are sure that it is being beaten back,” he said on CNN, “or else, if this thing boomerangs, you are putting off any kind of restart or recovery a hell of a lot longer.” A century ago, the Spanish flu epidemic’s second wave was far deadlier than its first, in part because authorities allowed mass gatherings from Philadelphia to San Francisco.“It is clear to me that we are in a critical moment of this fight. We risk complacency and accepting the preventable deaths of 2,000 Americans each day,” epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers, a professor at Johns Hopkins, told a House subcommittee in Washington.President Donald Trump, who has pressed hard to ease the restrictions that have throttled the economy and thrown more than three crore Americans out of work, pulled back Wednesday on White House plans revealed a day earlier to wind down the coronavirus task force.He tweeted that the task force will continue meeting indefinitely with a “focus on SAFETY & OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN”.Underscoring those economic concerns, the European Union predicted the worst recession in its quarter-century history. And the US unemployment rate for April, which comes out on Friday, is expected to hit a staggering 16 per cent, a level last seen during the Great Depression of the 1930s.Governors continue to face demands, even lawsuits, to reopen. In Michigan, where armed demonstrators entered the Capitol last week, the Republican-led Legislature sued Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer, asking a judge to declare invalid her stay-at-home order, which runs at least through May 15.In hard-hit Italy, which has begun easing restrictions, Dr Silvio Brusaferro, president of the Superior Institute of Health, urged “a huge investment” of resources to train medical personnel to monitor possible new cases of the virus, which has killed about 30,000 people nationwide.He said that contact-tracing apps — which are being built by dozens of countries and companies — are not enough to manage future waves of infection.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said after meeting with the country’s 16 governors that restaurants and other businesses will be allowed to reopen in the coming weeks but that regional authorities will have to draw up a “restriction concept” for any county that reports 50 new cases for every 100,000 inhabitants within a week.Lothar Wieler, head of Germany’s national disease control centre, said scientists “know with great certainty that there will be a second wave” of infections.Britain, with over 30,000 dead, the second-highest death toll in the world behind the US, plans to extend its lockdown but has begun recruiting 18,000 people to trace contacts of those infected.In other developments, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said nearly 5,000 coronavirus illnesses and at least 88 deaths have been reported among inmates in American jails and prisons. An additional 2,800 cases and 15 deaths were reported among guards and other staff members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/if-this-thing-boomerangs-second-wave-of-covid-19-infections-feared/story-Y5a7ckdXNggqTVfem5ftrO.html

You know they were going to buy $50 billion worth. The most they ever did was $15 billion and now they are going to $50 billion..., anywhere between $40 and 50 billion in terms of farm.

I will be able to report in about a week or two as to -- not only with the farmers but with many other industries also,” the president said.Trump refrained from answering a question on imposing tariff on China as a punishment for the spread of coronavirus.“I do not want to talk about that now. We are in the midst of some very big thing, so I just do not want to talk about that now,” he said.In the past few weeks, several US lawmakers have called for sanctions against China in response to their alleged cover-up of the coronavirus crisis.“China must be held accountable for its cover-up of the coronavirus outbreak, which led to American lives lost and the devastation of our booming economy,” Senator Steve Daines said.“The Chinese Communist regime withheld information and put the world at risk.

07-05-2020||World||Testosterone-reducing therapy may aid against coronavirus, study shows||Therapy to reduce testosterone and other hormones in men with prostate cancer may have a protective effect against the new coronavirus, a study of thousands of Italian patients showed.Men with the disease who got hormone therapy had a fourfold lower risk of virus infection than patients who didn’t get such treatment, the study showed. The difference was even more pronounced when the research team compared prostate cancer patients on hormone therapy with people who had any other type of cancer.The results don’t mean that virus patients should start taking hormone therapy, cautioned Fabrice Andre, director of research at the Institut Gustave Roussy in Paris and editor-in-chief of Annals of Oncology, where the results were published. But the data show that it would be worth studying the therapy in infected people, Andre said.“This is really a new piece in the puzzle,” said Andrea Alimonti, a professor of oncology at the Universita della Svizzera Italiana and ETH Zurich in Switzerland. Researchers are preparing a follow-up study in which high-risk virus patients would be randomly assigned to take the hormone treatment, and plan to be ready to start if there’s a second wave of infections later this year, Alimonti said.Reducing testosterone might help because a receptor for male hormones also regulates a protein called TMPRSS2, shown in other research to help Covid-19 infect healthy cells. Therapies that suppress male hormones can also decrease TMPRSS2 -- not just in the prostate, but in other tissues in the body, Alimonti said.The study looked at 4,532 men infected with Covid-19 in Italy’s Veneto region, finding that about 10% had cancer, while 2.6% had prostate cancer. Cancer patients had nearly twice the risk of getting the virus compared with the male population as a whole, and got sicker once they were infected. However, among the 5,273 men on hormone therapy for prostate cancer in Veneto, just four got the coronavirus, and none died.One confounding factor could have been that cancer patients on hormone therapy are treated at home instead of going to a hospital, making them better able to stick to social distancing, Alimonti said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/testosterone-reducing-therapy-may-aid-against-coronavirus-study-shows/story-KnneQ6gyJnffFzu0L29dyO.html

Luigi Aurisicchio, CEO of Takis, the firm that claims to have developed the vaccine, said that a coronavirus candidate vaccine has neutralised the virus in human cells for the first time, according to the news report.The researchers experimented with the vaccine on mice that successfully developed antibodies that blocked the virus from infecting the cells. The tests were reportedly carried out at Spallanzani Hospital in Rome.“This is the most advanced stage of testing of a candidate vaccine created in Italy. Human tests are expected after this summer,” Aurisicchio was quoted as saying by ANSA. The researchers observed that five vaccine candidates generated a large number of antibodies, after which two were selected. The vaccine candidates being developed are based on the genetic material of DNA protein “spikes”, the molecular tips used by the coronavirus to enter human cells. The researchers believe that this makes their vaccine particularly effective for generating functional antibodies against the “spike” protein. “To reach our goal, we need the support of national and international institutions and partners who may help us speed up the process,” the Takis CEO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-firm-claims-to-have-made-a-vaccine-to-contain-coronavirus/story-fl2DYhDRTUeGOb8wY0xULM.html

The panel will be repurposed to focus on “safety and reopening”, Trump tweeted less than 12 hours after saying he wanted to replace it with “something different” for phase two, the reopening of the country.The task force, he tweeted, will continue “indefinitely with its focus on SAFETY & OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN … and will also be very focused on Vaccines & Therapeutics”. Trump said he may “add or subtract people” from the panel.On Tuesday, while visiting a Honeywell manufacturing facility in Phoenix, Arizona, where he flouted the rule to wear a mask, Trump had revealed his intentions to wind down the task force. “We’re now looking at a little bit of a different form,” he said, adding a “different group” could be set up for phase two. Meanwhile, Rick Bright, a senior official in the department of health and human services, has alleged that his warnings about the outbreak made in January had been ignored. In a whistle-blower complaint, he said he shared with a reporter non-classified emails between government officials about hydroxychloroquine, in which they had “discussed the drug’s potential toxicity and demonstrated the political pressure to rush these drugs from Pakistan and India to American households”.
