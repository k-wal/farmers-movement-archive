Johnson dropped the hitherto core message to ‘stay home’ in a widely watched televised address on Sunday evening, but Scotland first minister Nicola Sturgeon pointed out that his announcement applied only to England and that Scotland would retain the ‘stay home’ advice.The number of coronavirus cases in the UK rose to 223,060, the Department of Health and Social Care said.Instead of the ‘stay home’ advice, Johnson said people should now ‘stay alert’ and those who cannot work from home should be “actively encouraged” to return to work. But the new advice was promptly criticised by Labour, trade unions and people for lack of clarity.A 60-page document setting out details of the new official advice was published on Monday afternoon, which included covering the face in public places. A five-stage alert system was also announced.Labour leader Keir Starmer said: “I was actually quite surprised the prime minister said, effectively in 12 hours’ time, start going back to work without those (guidelines on making workplaces safe) in place”.“We needed that clarity and it is unravelling a bit this morning because I think the foreign secretary (Dominic Raab) has now said, ‘Well, go back to work doesn’t really mean until Wednesday’, so suddenly it has shifted.”First ministers of Scotland and Wales said they would retain the ‘stay home’ message.Sturgeon said: “I think the prime minister has to make it clearer when he is talking only for England. What I don’t think is right for any government to do is to say we’re encouraging people to go back to work who haven’t worked so far before the guidance on what a safe working environment is has been published. That’s the bit that should come first.”Wales first minister Mark Drakeford added: “There are some differences in the messaging between England and Wales which I am concerned may cause confusion”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/row-over-lockdown-messaging-as-uk-toll-crosses-32-000/story-6LJ1k3gvFUJeIet07QjKfK.html
11-05-2020||World||13,500 British nationals repatriated from India on 58 flights||Around 13,500 British nationals stranded in India due to the coronavirus lockdown have been repatriated to their homes in the UK, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said on Monday.More than 30,000 British travellers have now returned to the UK on 142 special UK government charter flights from 27 different countries and territories since the outbreak of the coronavirus. The 30,000th passenger returned home on a special charter flight from India’s Amritsar city on Saturday evening.“On top of the 1.3 million Britons we’ve helped return on commercial flights, we’ve now brought back 30,000 UK travellers from 27 countries,” said UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.“We remain tirelessly focused on helping the most vulnerable Brits around the world get back home safe and sound,” he said.The FCO said it has been working around the clock with the airline industry and host governments across the world, with a 75-million pound fund for special charter flights to priority countries, focused on helping the most vulnerable travellers.So far, charter flights have returned British nationals to the UK from countries ranging from India, Pakistan and Nepal to Bolivia, Bermuda and New Zealand. India leads with 13,500 travellers returning so far since April 8, followed by 4,000 British nationals on 19 flights from Pakistan since April 20. Over 2,000 British nationals have returned from South Africa from April 9-17, more than 1,500 from New Zealand since April 25 and around 1,600 from Bangladesh since April 21.In one case, British High Commission staff in India masterminded a 60-hour, 1,700-mile-long trip involving five different drivers and crossing seven states, even receiving a police escort at one point, to make sure a British citizen could take one of the special return flights to the UK.The FCO said other efforts included a group of volunteers rescued from a remote part of Madagascar, climbers extracted from mountains in Nepal by British Gurkhas and backpackers reunited with their families after being flown home from South America.“The FCO helped passengers return home by providing consular assistance, working with local authorities, local military teams and cruise operators to allow ships to dock. The FCO will continue to send charter flights to bring back vulnerable British nationals who have no other way to return to the UK,” the Foreign Office said.A package of measures to support British nationals who are still waiting to return to the UK has also been put in place. The support package addresses financial issues, healthcare concerns and visa extensions, as well as loans for those who cannot afford flights to the UK where they have exhausted all other options.Some UK residents are also using the Air India flights from different Indian cities laid on by the Indian government to fly back stranded Indians from the UK as part of the Vande Bharat Mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/13-500-british-nationals-repatriated-from-india-on-58-flights/story-sqMdUnNYgoranw54zYRIzL.html

Shopkeepers trying to recover losses may need to wait days for Parisians to rediscover the daily habits from before the coronavirus halted most public life.“It’s a bit an act of faith today,” said Edouard Lefebvre, who heads the business district on the Champs-Elysees Avenue, packed with crowds of locals and foreign tourists in normal times.Only half of the avenue’s shops were open Monday, Lefebvreon said, reflecting the extensive preparations needed to safely receive customers and the hesitant steps many people took toward pre-pandemic routines.“Clients won’t come back on day one. It takes time to get used to coming back to the Champs-Elysees, to come back to Paris,” Lefebvre said in an interview with the Associated Press.Vehicles began filling streets again, but there were no traffic jams reported, and numerous people used bicycles to get around.Restaurants and bars - at the heart of France’s proverbial joie de vivre - are still waiting to learn when they will be back in business and cafe life can resume under the French government’s phased-in lifting of restrictions it imposed to stem the country’s coronavirus outbreak.France was hit hard by Covid-19, recording more than 26,000 virus-related deaths as of Sunday night. The virus still is circulating. Authorities, trying to strike a balance between public health and boosting the economy as cases plateaued, reopened numerous sectors around the country. They will reassess the situation in three weeks, wary of a second wave.Parisians grown used to hearing birds and smelling clean air during lockdown may find some aspects of deconfinement unpleasant, like motorists honking their horns and the heavy equipment at the capital’s thousands of construction sites, a source of inconvenient detours and noise that drowns out the sounds of nature.A construction worker on a Left Bank residential project that’s been in the works for two years said it was a pleasure to be back on the job after a period of home confinement that got a bit long. To guard against exposure to the virus, masks are obligatory for workers, hand sanitizer dispensers are in place around the huge site, and crews use one-way routes to move from floor to floor to maintain social distancing.Parisians donned heavy coats against a blustering wind and colder weather to stroll through their neighbourhoods without the permission slips they needed to venture out for just a few permitted purposes: food shopping, short jogs and imperative business.Now, the French can travel legally within a radius of 100 kilometers (60 miles) from their homes.For many shopkeepers, survival may depend on quickly enchanting everyone again, a special challenge with distancing rules that keep some waiting at the door to enter.“It will be a return, but slowly,” said florist Iswar Boodhoo whose shop is located on a strategic corner of the Montparnasse area, a Left Bank entertainment haunt.“People haven’t been working. They have lots of problems and flowers are a luxury,” he said.Lefebvre, of the Champs-Elysees business district, bemoaned what he said has been an 18-month-long economic “disaster” for Paris, from the weekly demonstrations by yellow vests movement protesters, to a major transportation strike over pension reform and then the coronavirus crisis.“Despite this, we are opening full of hope, even if it will take a long time to reconquer,” he said. “It’s important for a city like Paris to live again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-crisis-paris-awakens-after-2-month-slumber-to-world-of-yore-slowly/story-wQ4ovHG0V78KcVUyJyTqrM.html
11-05-2020||World||Covid-19 update: Restart or re-stop? Countries reopen amid second-wave fears||Plastic spacing barriers and millions of masks appeared on the streets of Europe’s newly reopened cities Monday, as France and Belgium emerged from lockdowns, the Netherlands sent children back to school and Spain let people eat outdoors.All faced the delicate balance of trying to restart battered economies without causing a second wave of coronavirus infections.Fears of infection spikes in countries that eased their restrictions have been borne out over the past few days in Germany, where new clusters were linked to three slaughterhouses; in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus started; and in South Korea, where one nightclub customer was linked to a 85 new cases.Health officials in the U.S. will be watching closely in the coming days for any resurgence of the virus two weeks after states began gradually reopening.Authorities have warned that the scourge could come back with a vengeance without widespread testing and tracing of infected people’s contacts, and efforts to assemble contact-tracing teams are underway in Europe and the U.S.While some countries such as Germany have established robust tracing abilities, other countries are far behind. Britain abandoned an initial effort in mid-March when the virus’s rapid spread made it impossible. Now it is recruiting 18,000 people to do the legwork of tracking contacts.Britain and other countries are also developing contact-tracing cellphone apps that can show whether someone has crossed paths with an infected person.In the hardest-hit corner of the U.S., contact tracers in New York began online training Monday. A May 15 goal for reopening parts of the state hinges on the ability to track the spread of the virus.Gov. Andrew Cuomo set a requirement of 30 contact tracers per 100,000 residents for areas to reopen. That translates to about 6,000 workers statewide.Contract tracing across the rest of the U.S. is a patchwork of approaches and readiness levels.In loosening up the country’s lockdown, German authorities have spelled out a specific level of infection that could lead to the reimposition of restrictions in local areas. Other countries — and U.S. states — have been vague about what would be enough to trigger another clampdown.With Monday’s partial reopening, the French did not have to carry forms allowing them to leave their homes. Crowds formed at some metro stations in Paris, but the city’s notorious traffic jams were absent. Only half the stores on the Champs-Elysees were open.Parisian hairdressers planned to charge a fee for the disposable protective gear they will have to give customers. Walk-ins will be a thing of the past, said Brigitte L’Hoste, manager of the Hair de Beauté salon.“The face of beauty will change, meaning clients won’t come here to relax. Clients will come because they need to,” said Aurelie Bollini, a beautician at the salon. “They will come and aim at getting the maximum done in the shortest time possible.”In South Korea, the government clamped down again, halting school reopenings planned for this week and reimposing restrictions on nightclubs and bars. It is trying to track down 5,500 patrons of a Seoul nightlife district by checking credit-card transactions, cellphone records and security camera footage.In China, Shanghai Disneyland reopened but with limited visitors who had to wear face masks and have their temperatures checked.Roughly half of Spain’s 47 million people shifted into looser restrictions, beginning to socialize, shop in small stores and sit outdoors at restaurants. Its biggest cities, Madrid and Barcelona, remained under lockdown.Spanish hotels were allowed to open with precautions, but their financial prospects were bleak with people not allowed to travel outside their provinces and few flights from overseas.“Unfortunately this year’s business is lost already. It’s going to be catastrophic,” said Manuel Domínguez, manager at Seville’s Doña María Hotel.In Belgium, Brussels’ City2 shopping mall reopened, and “everyone was impatient to open their shops, see their customers, so it is a relief despite the tremendous work they did to adapt their shops, to create paths with entries and exits for customers,” said manager Jurgen De Gelas.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a modest easing of the country’s lockdown but urged citizens not to squander the progress made. Some people, however, were confused as the government shifted its slogan from “Stay at Home” to “Stay Alert.” Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland stuck with the old motto.At the risk of more confusion, the British government did an about-face on masks Monday, telling people to cover their mouth and nose in stores and on buses and subways.People in jobs that cannot be done at home “should be actively encouraged to go to work” this week, Johnson said. He also set a goal of June 1 to begin reopening schools and shops if Britain can control new infections. Johnson himself is the only world leader to suffer a serious bout of COVID-19.At London’s Waterloo train station, not everyone was convinced.“I am nervous about going back, because I have a family and they have been isolating since the start. I feel like I am now putting them at risk,” said Peter Osu, 45, who was returning to work at a construction site.In the U.S., Trump administration officials spoke optimistically about a relatively quick economic rebound from the pandemic — but then announced that Vice President Mike Pence is “self-isolating” after an aide tested positive.The U.S. has seen 1.3 million confirmed infections and about 80,000 deaths, the most in the world by far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide, 4 million people have been reported infected and more than 280,000 have died, over 150,000 of them in Europe. Health experts believe all those numbers understate the true toll of the outbreak.Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the University of Washington institute that has created a widely cited model projecting the course of the outbreak, said that moves by states to reopen businesses “will translate into more cases and deaths in 10 days from now.” Infections and deaths are going up more than expected in Illinois, Arizona, Florida and California, he said.India reported its biggest daily increase in cases Monday as it prepared to resume train service to ease a lockdown that has hit migrant workers and their hungry families especially hard.In South Africa, authorities in Cape Town and the surrounding province considered reimposing a stricter lockdown as the area became the country’s coronavirus hotspot. The province accounts for about half of South Africa’s 200 virus deaths.___Perry reported from Wellington, New Zealand.

The total number of coronavirus cases in Nepal now stands at 134, it said, adding that 33 patients have recovered so far. Eight of the 22 cases reported from Kapilvastu district were those who returned to Nepal from India (Mumbai) last month, according to local authorities.“As we have reported new cases, we will expedite contact tracing now,” Yogendra Bhagat, chief of the health office, told Republica Online. Kapilvastu district is on high alert after a number of Covid-19 patients were reported from there, according to Chief District Officer Dirgha Narayan Poudel.He also added that the newly-confirmed cases and all others who returned from India have been kept in quarantine centres. The total number of active coronavirus patients in the Himalayan nation has reached 88 as 33 patients have been successfully treated. So far, Nepal has conducted PCR tests on 17,809 people for detecting the novel coronavirus.Earlier, confirmed coronavirus cases have been reported in Nepal from persons returning from the Tablighi Jamaat gathering in New Delhi’s Nizamuddin area in March.On May 4, sixteen people, including 15 who were already on quarantine after they came in contact with a religious leader who returned after attending the Tablighi Jamaat gathering in Delhi in March, were tested coronavirus positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-s-covid-19-cases-reach-134-after-8-more-returnees-from-india-test-positive/story-rdjjckTWVaLInCJzQQfmhN.html

The US last week announced it was limiting the visa-period for Chinese journalists to 90 days with the option to extend it.The Chinese foreign ministry said Washington to correct its mistakes against Chinese journalists immediately or it will face countermeasures.Opposing the US move, spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Monday said the US was escalating political suppression of Chinese media.It will affect their normal reporting in the US and affect bilateral people-to-people exchanges.“We are resolutely opposed and strongly dissatisfied with this,” Zhao said.“We require the U.S. to immediately correct its mistake, or China will have no choice but to take countermeasures.”Beijing and Washington have been involved in a series of tit-for-tat actions against journalists in recent months amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.In March, China expelled American journalists from three US newspapers, soon after the US said it would begin to treat five Chinese state-run media entities as foreign embassies.Weeks earlier, China expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters - two Americans and an Australian - after the paper published an opinion column calling China the “real sick man of Asia”.The two countries have been engaged in a series of critical diplomatic exchanges in recent weeks with Washington accusing Beijing of mishandling the pandemic, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.The coronavirus has infected more than 4.1 million people and killed over 282,000, according to the US’s Johns Hopkins University.China has retaliated by accusing the US of falsehood and having failed to tackle the outbreak in the country.On Sunday, China released an essay titled “Truth in China’s pandemic battle smashes absurd US allegations”, accusing American politicians of distorting facts to serve “political and propaganda purposes”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-of-countermeasures-after-us-tightens-visa-rules-for-chinese-journalists/story-1CDbQkdu6MvnGUzoWaXLSP.html

But the White House, America’s safest workplace, has become a “scary” place to work after recent infections, a senior official has acknowledged.“Vice President Pence will continue to follow the advice of the White House Medical Unit and is not in quarantine,” Devin O’Malley said in a statement.But with two staffers testing positive for Covid-19 recently and three top members of President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force going into self-quarantine after contacts with one on them, the White House may not look as safe as it ought to be, with all the resources available to it.“It is scary to go to work,” Kevin Hassett, a top economic adviser to the president who works in the White House, said on the CBS Sunday.On CNN, Hassett described his workplace, the West Wing that houses the president’s office and all his senior aides, as something that “with even all the testing in the world and the best medical team on Earth, is a relatively crammed place”.A US navy personnel, who was a personal valet to the president, was the first to test positive of Covid-19 last week. The day after, Katie Miller, press secretary to the vice-president, followed bringing the virus right into the inner sanctum of the White House. She is married to Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to the president on immigration., and regularly attended meetings of the coronavirus task force, which s headed by her boss, the vice-president.Though Miller was not identified as the source, three top members of the task force — Anthony Fauci, head of the national institute of allergies and infection diseases; Stephen Kahn, head of the Drug and Food Administration; Robert Redfield, head of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention— ent into self-quarantine on Saturday for “low-risk” exposure.Questions are being asked in the aftermath if the country’s safest workplace — as described last week by the president’s chief of staff Mark Meadows — what does it say for businesses, manufacturers and offices that are reopening and have far fewer resources to draw upon.Large parts of America are gearing up to reopen or have reopened as the rise in infections and fatalities continued to slow down. Deaths went up by 731 over the last 24 hours, in what is possibly the lowest single-day toll in weeks, to 79,531; and infections went up by 19,710 to 1.32 million.New York state, the epicenter of the American epidemic, accounted for more than a third of both the infections and fatalities with 1.8 million 26,641 respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-updates-us-vice-president-mike-pence-is-fine-but-senior-white-house-staffer-says-scary-to-go-to-work/story-Bmw05iKnyoFZRvhPJy7ujO.html

11-05-2020||World||New rise in Covid infections raises fears of a second wave||New clusters of coronavirus infections are igniting concerns about a second wave even as calls grow in some countries to relax restrictions even further.In Germany, where thousands have protested in recent days against the remaining restrictions, health officials said the number of people each confirmed coronavirus patient infects rose above 1 again, reflecting a renewed increase in cases.The number must be below one for outbreaks to decline.Worldwide, health officials are anxiously watching to see just how much infection rates rise in a second wave as nations and states emerge from varying degrees of lockdown.China reported 14 new cases on Sunday, its first double-digit rise in 10 days.Eleven of 12 domestic infections were in the northeastern province of Jilin, which prompted authorities to raise the threat level in one of its counties, Shulan, to high risk, just days after downgrading all regions to low risk.Authorities said the Shulan outbreak originated with a 45-year-old woman who had no recent travel or exposure history but spread it to her husband, her three sisters and other family members. Train services in the county were being suspended.Officials on Sunday also reported the first case of coronavirus in over a month in Wuhan, the city where the outbreak first started in December last year.“Epidemic control and prevention is a serious and complicated matter, and local authorities should never be overly optimistic, war-weary or off-guard,” said Jilin Communist Party secretary Bayin Chaolu.South Korea reported 34 more cases as new infections linked to nightclub-goers. It was the first time that South Korea’s daily infections were above 30 in about a month.Germany has seen regional spikes in cases linked to slaughterhouses and nursing homes. German officials have expressed concerns about the growing number of large demonstrations against the lockdowns, including one in the southwestern city of Stuttgart that drew thousands of participants. Police in Berlin had to step in Saturday after hundreds of people failed to respect social distancing measures at anti-lockdown rallies in Berlin. Australia and Switzerland also witnessed similar rallies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-rise-in-covid-infections-raises-fears-of-a-second-wave/story-RgpcvHUiGtmU2FG9DhW8rK.html

As governments try to balance health and economic priorities, medical experts have said that new flare-ups are inevitable.One such incident was reported in California’s Pasadena where a cluster of new infections was discovered.Health officials said that a large group of extended family and friends had attended a recent birthday party, despite a stay-at-home order in effect, leading to the spurt in infection, The Washington Post reported.CNN reported that one guest - a woman - at the party was coughing and not wearing a face mask. She was joking with people that she may have Covid-19, the channel reported. There were other people, said CNN, who ignored social distancing norms and did not cover their faces.Some of the guests who CNN spoke to called the woman’s behavious selfish.Through contact tracing, investigators discovered more than five confirmed cases and “many more ill individuals” linked to the party, the local public health department was quoted as saying.More than 65,000 people are infected with the coronavirus disease in California and at least 2,687 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University data.The controversy over when, and how much, to ease the restrictions have taken on a sharp political overtone, with protests especially in the United States, with occasional violence against those trying to keep the rules in place.Meanwhile, health authorities are also investigating 73 reported cases among New York children of the syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome, Governor Andrew Cuomo said during a news conference on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coughing-patient-at-a-birthday-party-results-in-covid-19-cluster-in-california/story-Ai7vty2RD9F9Lt5C1vLXuI.html

This was the highest daily increase in new cases since April 28.Mi Feng, spokesperson for the National Health Commission, warned people to “remain alert and step up personal protection against the virus.” This is the second double-digit increase in 10 days.Mi also asked people to “seek medical advice or testing in designated hospitals if they exhibit symptoms such as fever, cough or fatigue”. Of the 17 new cases, seven were listed as imported, while five were in the city of Wuhan, where a strict lockdown was lifted last month.The five new confirmed cases in Whuahn live in the same residential compound. One of them was the wife of an 89-year-old male patient reported a day earlier in the first confirmed case in the city since April 3.All of the latest confirmed cases were previously classified as asymptomatic - people who test positive for the virus and are capable of infecting others but do not show clinical signs such as a fever. Hundreds of asymptomatic cases in Wuhan, which was released on April 8 from a months-long lockdown, are currently being monitored, according to the city’s health authority. The number of new cases reported in China since April have been small compared with the thousands confirmed each day in February, thanks to a nationwide regime of screening, testing and quarantine.The National Health Commission, meanwhile, said that there had been no new Covid-19 death in China on Sunday. It has been a month since China reported any Covid-19-linked death.The country has reported 4,633 deaths from the virus among 82,918 total cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-reports-first-covid-19-cluster-authorities-ask-people-to-be-alert-amid-fears-of-resurgence/story-eVxXWjckPbIqlOYuQ5c09O.html

We’ve repeatedly stated our position on these. However, since the US kept repeating these lies, we must strive to help the world see the truth through facts time and again,” foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a press briefing. 24 LIES & FACTS about #COVID19https://t.co/STrpX9itri pic.twitter.com/BOGLSdISbOTalking about the allegations, she said, “They claimed China didn’t act fast enough. China is among the first countries hit by Covid-19. We have repeatedly shared the timeline of China’s response... they questioned the factuality of China’s numbers. People in their right mind will not assert blindly that other people are lying just because others’ numbers look better than their own. This is not children playing make-believe.”The spokesperson further sharpened the attack on the US, saying it did not act fast enough.“They questioned the factuality of China’s numbers. People in their right mind will not assert blindly that other people are lying just because others’ numbers look better than their own. This is not children playing make-believe,” said Hua.The Chinese foreign ministry has dedicated most of its press briefings over the past week to rejecting accusations by US politicians, especially Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, that China had withheld information about the new coronavirus and that it had originated in a laboratory in the city of Wuhan.“They talked about accountability and compensations. As was mentioned just now, survey results from Singapore show the Chinese people giving their government the highest rating for its response to Covid-19,” said China’s foreign ministry spokesperson.The article on the website of China’s foreign ministry also cited media reports that said Americans had been infected with the virus before the first case was confirmed in Wuhan. There is no evidence to suggest that is the case.Keen to quash US suggestions that the virus was deliberately created or somehow leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the article said that all evidence shows the virus is not man-made and that the institute is not capable of synthesising a new coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-refutes-24-lies-by-us-over-covid-19-says-washington-did-not-act-fast-enough/story-6dyV8n800KN1YByq8VtjMP.html

He did not provide details of how the disease spread in the facility or if safety measures had been in place. He said that the 533 positive cases, which represents around 11.3% of Ghana’s total infections, were part of a backlog of about 921 cases going back as far as April 26 that are only recently being reported.The new cases pushed Ghana’s total since the pandemic was first reported in the West African nation in mid-March to 4,700 as of Sunday night, the highest number of infections in West Africa.The president said 22 people have died of coronavirus-related causes, while 494 have recovered. With 160,501 tests since the outbreak, Akufo-Addo said Ghana had carried out more tests per million people than any other country in Africa.“The implementation of our strategy of aggressively tracing, testing and treating is our surest way of rooting out the virus,” Akufo-Addo said.He announced an extension of a ban on public gatherings until the end of May, and schools and universities will remain closed.Akufo-Addo eased a three-week lockdown on Ghana’s two main cities, Accra and Kumasi, on April 19 amid concerns over a prolonged lockdown on the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-person-infected-533-with-covid-19-at-ghana-fish-factory-president/story-nFgVdFJAHnaSbC1YjNOKdL.html
11-05-2020||World||Top US public health officials self-quarantine, Obama slams Trump’s handling of epidemic||Three top US public health officials at the forefront of the Trump administration’s response to the Covid-19 outbreak went into self-quarantine Saturday for the next two weeks after “low-risk” exposure to the deadly virus through contacts with someone who has tested positive.Heads of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Robert Redfield and the Food and Drug Administration will be teleworking from home as a result, their spokespersons have told news publications. And Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergies and Infections Diseases told CNN he will be going in “modified quarantine”. All three are members of the White task force on the coronavirus outbreak.Fauci has said he will be working from home, will wear a mask and will go to office only when he will be sure to be the only one around at the time.Fauci, Hahn and Redfield are scheduled to testify before a committee of the US senate on Tuesday, but they will now not appear in person but through a video link.The source of their exposure was not identified. But Katie Miller, press secretary of Vice-President Mike Pence, tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, used to frequently attend the meeting of the task-force, which is headed by her boss. She is the second White House staffer to test positive, after a US navy personnel serving as a personal valet to the president.The White House has stepped up screening since and both the president and the vice-president are now tested every day.At least 11 members of the US Secret Service, which protects present and past presidents, have also tested positive and 60 are in self-quarantine for possible exposure, according to news reports. It was not clear if any of them had been posted at the White House at the time of their exposure.US fatalities went up by 1,615 over the past 24 hours to 78,794 Sunday morning and the number of confirmed and reported infections increased by 25,621 over the same period to 1.3 million.President Donald Trump has personally faced criticism for not following his administration’s Covid-19 protocols to wear a mask in situations were social-distancing may be difficult. He met US military leaders at the White House on Saturday and did not wear a face covering, neither did any of the others.Questions have continued to be raised about President Trump’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has ranged from being dismissive initially to finger-pointing when the situation spiraled out of control to self-congratulatory even while fatalities and infections mounted. President Barack Obama joined in in a recent conference call with about 3,000 erstwhile members of his administration. “It would have been bad even with the best of governments,” he said, in a recording first reported by Yahoo News. “It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset — of ‘what’s in it for me’ and ‘to heck with everybody else’ — when that mindset is operationalized in our government.”Trump had not responded to the attack yet, but he has frequently sought to blame his administration’s failures in the handling of the epidemic on Obama, saying he had left “empty shelves” of essential medical supplies such as masks, testing kits (despite the fact that this is a new virus), protective gear for healthcare workers and ventilators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-public-health-officials-self-quarantine-obama-slams-trump-s-handling-of-epidemic/story-J0TLH1NkT2Yvbq5G9Gv88H.html
