The US has accused the world body of botching the initial response and, then, of siding with China to help it conceal the exact extent of the virus outbreak. Subsequently, WHO officials had denied the claims by President and China has insisted it was transparent and open. At home in the US, the president has continued to encourage the reopening of the country, at odds with his own public health officials. He has publicly dismissed, for instance, calls for caution by Anthony Fauci, the top epidemiologist and member of the White House task force.On Friday, the chief government body for disease control and prevention has projected the death toll of Americans succumbing to Covid-19 could climb to 100,000 in two weeks, up by 13,000 from the toll on Friday.The projection of fatalities by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is based on 12 models, its director Robert Redfield, who is also member of the task force, wrote on twitter Friday. And it came as grim reminder of the need for continued surveillance and mitigation as that public health officials are urging as at least 48 states of the US are set to reopen to varying extent by early next week.“CDC tracks 12 different forecasting models of possible #COVID19 deaths in the US. As of May 11, all forecast an increase in deaths in the coming weeks and a cumulative total exceeding 100,000 by June 1,” he wrote.Covid-19 fatalities rose by 1,632 over the past 24 hours to 87,568 and the number of infections increased by 25,050 to 1.44 million. With nearly 13,000 more fatalities projected by the CDC the situation will get grimmer, specially with the removal of restrictions that it is feared to could take the toll to 147,000 by August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-could-partially-restore-who-funding-us-toll-could-hit-100-000-in-two-weeks/story-95IKIXjkhqLqSYuhXh5JmO.html

That was two days after the country relaxed many of its lockdown rules, including reopening restaurants.But social distancing rules still apply, requiring groups to remain at least 1 meter (3 feet) apart from each other. Many restaurants have limited their seating to comply with the rules.What happened next played out on Twitter: “Omg Jacinda Ardern just tried to come into Olive and was rejected cause it’s full,” wrote one Twitter user, Joey.Gayford took the time to respond: “I have to take responsibility for this, I didn’t get organized and book anywhere. Was very nice of them to chase us down st (street) when a spot freed up. A+ service.” Another Twitter user, Joanne, chimed in: “This has to be the most Kiwi tweet I’ve ever read ... love it, love NZ.” Asked for comment, a spokesperson from Ardern’s office said in an email that waiting at a cafe is something that anyone can experience during New Zealand’s virus restrictions: “The PM says she just waits like everyone else.” Ardern has been widely praised for her swift and decisive response to the pandemic. New Zealand closed its borders and instituted a strict lockdown in March, and has been largely successful in its goal of eliminating the virus. Health authorities have reported just a single new case over the past five days. The country has confirmed a total of 1,498 cases, including 21 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-special-favours-new-zealand-leader-turned-away-from-cafe/story-YajrzhtNotof2J4jyntwPK.html
16-05-2020||World||Donald Trump says he is considering restoring some funding to WHO, no decision made||U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday his administration was considering numerous proposals about the World Health Organization, including one in which Washington would pay about 10% of its former level.In a posting on Twitter, Trump underscored that no final decision had been made and that U.S. funding for the global health agency remained frozen. Trump suspended U.S. contributions to the WHO on April 14, accusing it of promoting China’s “disinformation” about the coronavirus outbreak and saying his administration would launch a review of the organization. WHO officials denied the claims and China has insisted it was transparent and open. Fox News, citing a draft letter, reported late on Friday that Trump was poised to restore partial funding to the WHO, matching China’s assessed contribution.The United States was the WHO’s biggest donor. If the United States matches China’s contribution, as the Fox report indicated, its new funding level will be about one-tenth its previous funding amount of about $400 million per year. Responding to criticism about resuming payments, Trump said, “This is just one of numerous concepts being considered under which we would pay 10% of what we have been paying over many years, matching much lower China payments. Have not made final decision. All funds are frozen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-is-considering-restoring-some-funding-to-who-no-decision-made/story-g6XeFcwiDZ2eHx6QS2KOdI.html

The outlet cited analysts and executives as saying that many car owners who previously had left them home in favour of shared or public transportation are now taking their own vehicles out of safety concerns.“We have seen interest from a new kind of customer, those keen to own a personal vehicle to escape the risks of infection on public transport,” Stephan Wollenstein, chief executive of Volkswagen Group China, was quoted as saying, last week.The WSJ citing Ford Motor Co. executives reported that they have started to re-evaluate business plans for autonomous vehicles, concerned the pandemic could lower demand for shared services for a longer term.This sudden interest in use of private transportation is already having an impact on Uber and its ride-hailing rival, Lyft Inc, reported The WSJ. “Rider demand on our platform will be down for the foreseeable future,” Lyft CEO Logan Green had said last week.Mike Jackson, chief executive for AutoNation Inc., the US’s largest dealership chain, while speaking of customers who are heading to showroom said they want personal space in mobility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-pushes-people-to-shun-means-of-mass-transportation-revives-consumers-interest-in-cars/story-FJ8qpNyV8L3op1Pi7HCh8J.html

But just as many did not. In some cases, volunteer workers were not insisting that they comply.“At another open-air testing kiosk, where throat swabs were taken, yellow and black stickers on the ground kept people from converging. But at the back of the long queue, about 40 people gathered with no guidance from officials or volunteers”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/8k-quarantined-in-ne-chinese-city-as-wary-wuhan-continues-to-test-amid-infection-fear-report/story-uXEHrHcGbvpNa0KXx3uEAO.html

There were 9,200 new confirmed coronavirus cases, the lowest increase since May 1, bringing overall infections to 272,043.The rate of increase total cases has gradually slowed, easing to 3.5 per cent from 5.8 per cent a week earlier. Some 44.8 per cent of new cases are asymptomatic, while the number of recoveries increased by 4,940 in the past day to 63,166, according to the center.Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the end of a six-week national stay-at-home order on Monday, while making regional governors responsible for relaxing lockdowns in their areas. Russia passed Spain on Tuesday to become the country with the second-most coronavirus cases in the world after the US, while also reporting the lowest fatalities among states with the highest numbers of infections.In Moscow, construction and industrial sectors have resumed work, though Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has said other restrictions must stay in place until at least May 31. He also ordered people to wear masks and gloves in public.The decline in new cases occurred mainly due to the Russian capital, where the infections rose by 3,505, down 26 per cent on the previous day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-reports-rise-in-coronavirus-deaths-amid-decline-in-new-cases/story-T4wWpEEwuUBNlsoNJqZ3RL.html

The resumption of the domestic flight services from five major airports on Saturday came as the Pakistan government last week said that it would begin a phased lifting of the lockdown due to its effect on the economy and the workforce, the Geo News reported.“The first Pakistan International Airline (PIA) flight carrying 84 passengers departed from Karachi for Lahore at 1pm along with flights for Lahore and Islamabad via private airlines,” the report said.The five major airports allowed to restart operations include Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport, Islamabad International Airport (IIAP), Quetta International Airport and Peshawar’s Bacha Khan International Airport.A spokesperson for the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCCA) said domestic flights will be operated by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and one private company for now.The ban on international flight operations, meanwhile, has been extended until May 31.However, the PCCA is keeping a close monitor of the passengers before they board the flight to ensure there is no further rise in Covid-19 cases. “Passengers will be required to fill health declaration forms before boarding the airplane and subjected to thermal scanning on entry and exit into and from a city. All luggage will be disinfected and no meet and greet will be allowed at the airports,” the report said.Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan earlier said that social distancing will be followed based on available seats and flights will only be allowed to fill 50 per cent of their full capacity, the report said.Pakistan on Saturday said it has reported 1,581 new cases of coronavirus in the last 24 hours, taking the total infections in the country to 38,799 with 834 deaths.

16-05-2020||World||Most US states fall short of recommended Covid-19 testing levels||As businesses reopened Friday in more of the US, an overwhelming majority of states still fall short of the Covid-19 testing levels that public health experts say are necessary to safely ease lockdowns and avoid another deadly wave of outbreaks, according to an Associated Press analysis.Rapid, widespread testing is considered essential to tracking and containing the coronavirus. But 41 of the nation’s 50 states fail to test widely enough to drive their infections below a key benchmark, according to an AP analysis of metrics developed by Harvard’s Global Health Institute.Click here for Covid-19 coverageAmong the states falling short are Texas and Georgia, which recently moved aggressively to reopen stores, malls, barbershops and other businesses.Also Friday, Democrats approved a massive $3 trillion coronavirus response bill in the House over Republican opposition. It aims aims to prop up a US economy in free fall and a health care system overwhelmed by a pandemic. But the measure has no chance of passing the GOP-controlled Senate and has already drawn a White House veto threat.As health authorities expand testing to more people, the number of positive results should shrink compared with the total number of people tested. The World Health Organization and other health researchers have said a percentage above 10% indicates inadequate testing. South Korea, a country praised for its rapid response, quickly pushed its positive cases to below 3%.Most governors are moving ahead with unlocking their states, even in cases where they are not meeting broad guidelines recommended by the White House.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has set a goal of 30,000 tests per day as his state launched one of the nation’s most aggressive reopenings on May 1. He never set a firm date on when the state would hit the 30,000 mark, but for most of May, the daily testing numbers fell short of that.Local leaders say tests are still in short supply. El Paso officials have pleaded with the governor to postpone easing up any more business restrictions in light of the Covid-19 cases there surging 60% over the past two weeks.The first stage of Maryland’s reopening began Friday evening, when some retail stores were allowed to reopen and a stay-at-home order was lifted. Some of the hardest-hit parts of the state, including the suburbs of Washington, D.C., extended restrictions for residents and businesses.Maryland averaged 4,265 tests per day this week, compared with about 4,900 the previous week. Nearly 22 percent of people tested positive in Maryland on average over the last seven days.Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan made headlines last month when the state acquired 500,000 test kits from a South Korean company in a confidential deal, but Maryland has not had all the components needed for testing — like swabs — to meet demand. Hogan said Maryland just received swabs this week from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.“We requested 350,000,” Hogan said Wednesday. “They’ve committed to 225,000, and I think we got 75,000 yesterday with another 125,000 that are supposedly days away, along with the tubes and the stuff that goes with them. So it’s not enough, but it helps us.”Harvard University researchers have calculated that the US needs to test at least 900,000 people daily to safely reopen the economy, based on the 10% positivity rate and other key metrics. That goal is nearly three times the country’s current daily testing tally of about 360,000, according to figures compiled by the Covid Tracking Project website.“The fact that testing has become the Achilles’ heel that has made it hard for us to have a great national response to this pandemic is a tragedy,” said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute.President Donald Trump insisted again this week that his administration “met the moment” and “prevailed” on testing, even as he continued shifting responsibility for the effort to the governors. Administration officials said they will provide states with enough testing supplies to conduct about 400,000 tests per day in May and June. That’s less than half the total recommended by the Harvard team.Only nine states met the daily rate recommended by Jha and his colleagues, according to the AP analysis. Most of those states are large and rural, such as Montana, Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming. Meanwhile, states with some of the biggest testing shortfalls, including New York and New Jersey, have signaled they will keep stay-at-home orders in place or only partially ease restrictions.“I really do feel there are dangers here to opening up without enough tests, but I don’t feel it’s a uniform danger everywhere in the country,” Jha said.In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo will allow many smaller cities and rural regions of upstate New York to gradually reopen first, industry by industry, in areas that have been spared the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak.The first wave of businesses includes retail — though only for curbside or in-store pickup — along with construction and manufacturing. Cuomo also announced beaches would be allowed to open in time for the Memorial Day weekend.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy will let individual shore towns decide whether to reopen beaches. His long-awaited guidance Thursday directed them to set occupancy limits, require 6 feet (2 meters) of space between beachgoers, except family members or couples, and prohibit groups of 10 or more from congregating on the beach.California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that the state’s testing reached 35,000 daily this week and that more than 1 million tests have been administered. The state remains on lockdown, though Southern California’s beaches are open with restrictions.North Carolina also has made testing progress, reporting on an all-time high of more than 12,000 additional tests completed Friday compared to the previous day. But the state’s seven-day rolling average of just over 6,000 tests is still well below the 11,000 daily tests recommended by the Harvard team. The testing increases over the past few weeks contributed in part to Gov. Roy Cooper and state leaders feeling comfortable with easing his stay-at-home order May 8.Grand Canyon National Park reopened Friday to allow visitors in for day trips but not overnight. By 7:30 a.m., more than two dozen people were enjoying South Rim viewpoints. Signs reminded tourists to keep their distance from one another and stay in groups of less than 10.Volume of testing isn’t the only concern. The Food and Drug Administration said late Thursday that it was investigating preliminary data suggesting a rapid Covid-19 test used daily to test Trump and key members of his staff can miss infections. Trump expressed confidence in the test from Abbott Laboratories.Worldwide, there have been more than 4.4 million coronavirus infections reported and 300,000 deaths, while nearly 1.6 million people have recovered, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-us-states-fall-short-of-recommended-covid-19-testing-levels/story-ury13SGkqKJlWCeYDUumVM.html
16-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Italy to allow travel to and from abroad from June 3||Italy’s government on Saturday approved a decree which will allow travel to and from abroad from June 3, in a major development as it moves to unwind one of the world’s most rigid coronavirus lockdowns.The government will allow free travel across the country from that same day. Some regions had pushed for a swifter rollback, but Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has insisted on a gradual return to normal to prevent a second wave of infections.More than 31,600 Italians have died of Covid-19 since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21, the third-highest death toll in the world after that of the United States and Britain. In a bid to contain the contagion, Italy was the first European country to impose nationwide restrictions in March, only sanctioning an initial relaxation of the rules on May 4, when it allowed factories and parks to reopen.Shops are due to open on May 18 and the government decided that all movement within individual regions should be allowed that same day, meaning people will be able to visit friends. The inter-regional and foreign travel ban will remain in place until after Italy’s June 2 Republic Day holiday, preventing any mass travel over that long-holiday weekend.But all travel curb will be lifted from June 3 -- a major milestone on Italy’s road to recovery, with the government hoping to salvage the forthcoming vacation season, when Italians traditionally escape the cities for their annual summer breaks.The regions can reactivate all sectors of the economy that might still be shuttered, so long as safety protocols are followed. National health authorities will monitor the situation to make sure infections are kept in check, the decree said.Shops and restaurants across the country are preparing to reopen under strict social distancing and hygiene rules, as recommended by health authorities.“The challenge is huge, so big it is hard to quantify, and most of all there is uncertainty. The sense of uncertainty is dominating everything,” said Alberto Volpe, manager of a clothing shop in central Rome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-italy-to-allow-travel-to-and-from-abroad-from-june-3/story-G1Jpr440oSWR1dTHIF3RBJ.html
16-05-2020||World||Trump fires State Department watchdog critical of admin moves||President Donald Trump has fired the State Department’s inspector general, an Obama administration appointee whose office was critical of alleged political bias in the agency’s management. The ouster is the latest in a series of moves against independent executive branch watchdogs who have found fault with the Trump administration.A senior department official said Trump removed Steve Linick from his job on Friday but gave no reason for his ouster. In a letter to Congress, Trump said Linick, who had held the job since 2013, no longer had his full confidence and that his removal would take effect in 30 days. Trump did not mention Linick by name in his letter.Democrats in Congress immediately cried foul, with the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee suggesting that Linick was fired in part in retaliation for opening an unspecified investigation into Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.“This firing is the outrageous act of a president trying to protect one of his most loyal supporters, the secretary of state, from accountability,” Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., said in a statement. “I have learned that the Office of the Inspector General had opened an investigation into Secretary Pompeo. Mr. Linick’s firing amid such a probe strongly suggests that this is an unlawful act of retaliation.”Engel offered no details of the alleged investigation into Pompeo, but Linick’s office had issued several reports critical of the department’s handling of personnel matters, including accusing some of Trump’s appointees of retaliating against career officials.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also condemned Linick’s ouster, saying he had been “punished for honorably performing his duty to protect the Constitution and our national security.”“The president must cease his pattern of reprisal and retaliation against the public servants who are working to keep Americans safe, particularly during this time of global emergency.”Linick will replaced by Stephen Akard, a former career foreign service officer who has close ties to Vice President Mike Pence, said the official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Akard currently runs the department’s Office of Foreign Missions. He had been nominated to be the director general of the foreign service but withdrew after objections he wasn’t experienced enough.Linick, a former assistant U.S. attorney in California and Virginia, had overseen inspector general reports that were highly critical of the department’s management policies during the Trump administration. His office had criticized several Trump appointees for their treatment of career staff for apparently being insufficiently supportive of Trump and his policies.Under Linick, the State Department’s inspector general office was also critical of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s hiring freeze and attempts to streamline the agency by slashing its funding and personnel.Trump has been taking aim lately at inspectors general.In April, he fired Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, for his role in the whistleblower complaint that led to Trump’s impeachment.Then Trump removed Glenn Fine as acting inspector general at the Defense Department, a move that stripped him of his post as chairman of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.During a White House briefing on COVID-19, Trump questioned the independence of an inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services over a report that said there was a shortage of supplies and testing at hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-fires-state-dept-watchdog-critical-of-trump-moves/story-AGHBeOHWlsSZczewMmRvNN.html

We will see what happens over the next little while,” Trump told reporters at the White House, when asked why he did not want to not speak to Xi.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  China, as per the trade deal inked earlier this year, is buying a lot more of American goods than last year. “They are spending a lot on the trade deal, but the trade deal I don’t know somehow I lost a little flavour for it, you can understand,” Trump said. Earlier in the day, Trump said he did not want to talk about the trade deal. “I don’t want to talk about it. I can say China is buying a lot of our products. But the trade deal -- the ink was barely dry -- when this (coronavirus) came in from China. So, it’s not like we’re thrilled,” he said. “This should have never happened. This came from China. It should have been stopped in China before it got out to the world. One-eighty-six countries are affected. Each country that’s affected is the same thing. Russia now is badly affected. France is badly affected. You look at each country and you can say “affected” or you can say “infected,” either way you want to put it,” he said. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters that President Trump is frustrated with China. “I will leave it to the president as to when he resumes speaking with the Chinese leader. But look, China slow walked this. I’ve shared with you guys before on human-to-human transmission. It was really important that the world knew of that aspect of the disease, but that information was slow walked through to the WHO,” she said. “The genetic sequencing, likewise, was not given until a professor in Shanghai did so on his own. The president has repeatedly noted that why are they letting flights out of China but not into China? These decisions put American lives at risk. Not just American lives, the lives around the globe,” she said. “We know that this disease came from China, and why that information was not shared, some of the information I just suggested is really unacceptable. So he’s frustrated at this point, and I’ll leave it to him,” McEnany said. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Trump administration will not tolerate efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to undermine the privacy of US citizens or the integrity of next-generation networks worldwide.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  “(Chinese technology company) Huawei is an untrustworthy vendor and a tool of the Chinese Communist Party, beholden to its orders. The Department of Justice has indicted Huawei for stealing US technology and helping Iran evade sanctions, and the Department of Commerce has placed Huawei on the Entity List in 2019. The Department of State has engaged for more than a year to share what we know about Huawei and other untrustworthy vendors with allies and partners around the world,” he said. On Friday, the Department of Justice expanded rules to prevent Huawei from undermining US export controls, closing a loophole that has allowed the company to exploit US technology and threaten national security. “It also imposes US export control restrictions on countries that use US technology or software to design and produce semiconductors for Huawei. Companies wishing to sell certain items to Huawei produced with US technology must now obtain a license from the United States,” he said.

It declared an epidemic on March 12.“Slovenia has tamed the epidemic over the past two months... Today Slovenia has the best epidemiologic picture in Europe,” Prime Minister Janez Jansa told parliament earlier on Thursday.The end of epidemic means some measures, including financial aid to citizens and firms hit by the coronavirus, will expire at the end of May.The government said foreign citizens who show signs of coronavirus infection will still not be allowed to enter the country.A quarantine of at least 14 days will remain in place for people from non-EU states, except for some exemptions including diplomats and people transporting cargo.Citizens will still have to follow basic rules to prevent a possible spread of infection, the government said without elaborating.People have been required to wear masks in indoor public spaces, stand at least 1.5 metres (5 feet) apart and disinfect hands upon entering public spaces.Since the middle of March, Slovenia has closed all schools, sports and cultural institutions, bars, restaurants, hotels and shops apart from food and drug stores, while cancelling public transport.The government has started easing the lockdown from April 20.

16-05-2020||World||Worrying surge in childhood disease may be linked to Covid-19: WHO||Europe and the United States have seen sharp surges in recent weeks of a severe immune disorder in children linked to Covid-19, health authorities reported Friday, sounding an alarm.At least five children -- three in New York, and one each in France and Britain -- have died from the syndrome, and at least two other deaths are suspect.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageUp to now, Covid-19 -- with 4.5 million confirmed cases worldwide, and more than 300,000 deaths -- has largely spared small children and teens, though many are thought to have been infected without showing symptoms.But the new illness, while still very rare by comparison, suggests that no age bracket is safe.Europe has seen some 230 suspected cases of so-called paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) in children up to 14 years old, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said Friday.Doctors in Bergamo, northern Italy reported a 30-fold increase in the incidence of severe inflammatory disorders among young children, with ten cases from mid-February to mid-April as compared to 19 during the previous five years, according to a study this week in The Lancet. In the US, where well over 100 cases have been identified in the New York area, health authorities have issued an alert for the mysterious illness. “Initial reports hypothesise that this syndrome may be related to Covid-19,” World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing Friday, calling on clinicians worldwide to help “better understand this syndrome in children.”France’s state-run health watchdog described the likelihood of such a link as “very probable.”Like Kawasaki disease, a rare condition that occurs in very young children, the new disorder can cause persistent fever, searing abdominal pain, rashes and a swollen tongue.Also compared to toxic shock syndrome, PIMS leads to inflamed blood vessels and, in some cases, damage to the heart.A nine-year-old boy who died in the southern French city of Marseille was said to have suffered “a neurological injury related to cardiac arrest” -- in other words, a heart attack.A delayed impact Experts speculate that the virus triggers a violent response in the immune system, causing it to turn against, rather than protect, the tissue and organs of affected children.“They had the virus, the body fought it off earlier,” Sunil Sood, a paediatrician at Cohen Children’s Medical Center in New York, told AFP. “But now there’s this delayed, exaggerated immune response.”PIMS is different, however, from the Kawasaki syndrome in that it seems mainly to affect older children.“The population we are seeing are seven or eight through to 17,” Karyn Moshal, a paediatric infectious disease consultant at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London told BMJ, a medical journal.Only a minority of children affected by the inflammatory syndrome have tested positive for the new coronavirus, but that doesn’t mean they didn’t have it, experts say.Evelina London Children’s Hospital has seen more than 50 children with signs of the syndrome, said Julia Kenny, a consultant in immunology at the hospital.“While very few tested positive for the virus on swabs, the majority tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies,” which means they caught the virus without knowing it, she told BMJ.Indeed, the surge in PIMS cases appears to lag several weeks behind the peak in Covid-19 infections across the general population, suggesting that antibodies may play a role in triggering the symptoms.“In London, the peak (across the whole population) was estimated around the first or second week of April, and we think we saw the peak of these children this or last week,” Liz Whittaker, a lecturer in children’s infectious disease and immunology at Imperial College London, said at a press briefing on Wednesday. “What we wonder is whether this is an antibody mediated or delayed response to the virus that is happening several weeks after the infection,” she said. “That would explain why these children don’t test positive for the virus.”Researchers are groping for answers as to why some kids and not others get hit with the syndrome.In adults, the strongest predictors have been pre-existing health problems, especially high blood pressure, but none of these applies to young children.One theory emerging from the recent cases points to a genetic link.In England, six of the eight first cases observed were in children of Afro-Caribbean origin, according to a study last week in The Lancet.The boy who died in France was also of African origin, his doctor reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worrying-surge-in-childhood-disease-may-be-linked-to-covid-19-who/story-wYIfEki4pRyf8ndrvG3QWN.html
16-05-2020||World||Fearing Covid-19, biggest US university system makes fall term virtual||As uncertainty about the spread of Covid-19 continues, the biggest university system in the United States decided this week to make fall term classes virtual, one of the first to do so, amid fears of a second wave of infections in the month ahead.California State University said almost all classes across its 23 university campuses would be online at least until the end of the fall term. Programs such as the maritime academy, which holds classes aboard a training ship, may be among a handful of exceptions. The Cal State university system serves 482,000 students.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“As the largest four-year system of higher education in the country, while the spotlight is on us in terms of the decision, we weren’t hoping to influence anyone,” said Cal State spokesperson Mike Uhlenkamp.“This is a decision that the chancellor and the campus presidents arrived at that we feel is in the best interests of our students and our employees.”Colleges and universities across the United States are grappling with similar decisions. But it was the timing of Cal State’s announcement that came to some as a surprise. Other colleges and universities have said their decisions would come later in the summer.As of Friday, the Covid-19 respiratory disease has infected more than 1.4 million Americans and killed at least 85,816, according to a Reuters tally. Efforts to stem the spread of the disease have shut schools and businesses nationwide, severely disrupted travel and devastated the economy. Top US infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci has warned that a second wave of infections is a near certainty in the fall, which helped influence Cal State’s decision, according to the chancellor’s statement earlier this week.“Obviously, this isn’t what anyone had planned for,” said Cal State’s Uhlenkamp. “I want to make sure that people understand that we’re not closed. The campuses are not closed.”’Social aspect’Cal State universities moved to online classes on March 17. Students who could go home were asked to do so; those who couldn’t were permitted to remain on campus.“The social aspect is just completely gone, and I do very much miss it,” said Ofer Barr, a 19-year-old mechanical engineering student at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, who has moved back in with his parents in Los Angeles.“Here at home, the only thing I’ve really found that lets me have any kind of social interaction is video games,” Barr said.Some students are now living with their families in different time zones, which can be a problem for classes with fixed times. Some classes are hard to make virtual.“A lot of the art classes that I take are lab classes, they’re studio classes,” said William Hunter, a 21-year-old studio arts major at San Francisco State University.Moving online has been costly for the universities. Earlier this week Cal State’s board of trustees discussed an estimated $337 million in new costs and revenue losses for the spring term due to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fearing-covid-19-biggest-us-university-system-makes-fall-term-virtual/story-yvZqGRmeVAK2StDfouatWI.html

16-05-2020||World||Coronavirus pandemic planning becomes political weapon as deaths mount in US||For the first three years of his presidency, Donald Trump did not publicly utter the words “pandemic” or “preparedness.” Not in speeches, rallies or his many news conferences, planned and impromptu.But on Friday, the White House pointed to extensive planning exercises the administration conducted and reports it wrote warning of the threat in 2018.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageStill, Trump has repeatedly said that the blame for the federal government having inadequate stockpiles of crucial supplies and machines needed to cope with an outbreak lay with his predecessor, Barack Obama.Obama has been a persistent foil for Trump on a number of issues, but in the case of planning for the pandemic he has devoted little attention to the 69-page “playbook” from the Obama administration about the threat of a viral outbreak that might include Ebola or an airborne respiratory illness like coronavirus. And the Obama administration could draw from a similar document written during the administration of George W. Bush in 2006.The politics of pandemic planning have gotten increasingly pitched as the Covid-19 death toll continues to mount in the United States.Trump claims he inherited a “broken, terrible” system from Obama. Critics counter that Trump had three years in office to prepare — more than enough time to build on the pandemic strategies he inherited.The friction was laid bare in the Rose Garden and the White House briefing room on Friday.Trump, at a midday event outside the Oval Office, declared: “I inherited nothing. I inherited practically nothing from the previous administration, unfortunately.”His spokeswoman, Kayleigh McEnany, later displayed a copy of the Obama plan dismissively during a briefing in the White House press room before hoisting two binders of what she called the superior Trump plans.Beth Cameron, who worked on pandemic planning in the Obama administration, said the playbook that the Obama administration presented to the Trump administration “was given, briefed and discussed with the incoming administration, explicitly.” She said it was intended to provide the White House with a set of questions it should ask early on in an emerging epidemic or pandemic threat.“It outlined who should come together to answer those questions and to be prepared to anticipate what was coming next ... to get moving,” Cameron said. She said the Trump administration was slow to respond to Covid-19 and that Obama’s playbook could have helped the administration get ahead of an emerging threat like the coronavirus.Cameron said the Bush and Obama administrations both did extensive planning for pandemics and many of those plans were passed to the Trump White House. “They were not political. They were non-partisan,” she added.McEnany styled the Trump administration’s response to Covid-19 as “unprecedented.” She referred to Obama’s plan as a “thin packet of paper” that was replaced by “two detailed, robust pandemic response reports commissioned by the Trump administration.”She said that in 2018 the Trump administration issued its own pandemic crisis action plan and last summer conducted Crimson Contagion 2019, a simulation to test the nation’s ability to respond to a large-scale outbreak. In January, the Department of Health and Human Services issued an after-action report.“This exercise expounded upon — exposed rather — the shortcomings in legacy planning documents, which inform President Trump’s coronavirus response beginning as early as January,” McEnany said.Her comments drew criticism from Ron Klain, who was the U.S. Ebola response coordinator during the Obama administration and now advises Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden.“Let’s get to the bottom line,” Klain tweeted after McEnany’s briefing. “If their position now is that they HAD a plan, and that THIS was their plan ... I fail to see how that is a helpful argument for them in any way.”The Trump administration’s 36-page National Biodefense Strategy, issued in September 2018, was a self-described “call to action.” Among the many goals was bolstering preparedness to save lives through “medical countermeasures,” such as vaccines, ventilators, diagnostic tests and personal protective equipment like medical gowns and masks that were in short supply in the early days of the pandemic.McEnacy said the nation’s stockpile was insufficient, but didn’t answer questions about why Trump didn’t work to restock it during his first three years in office. The White House said the stockpile had only 28% of the items needed during a pandemic and contained less than a one-month supply of key items, but the administration is updating inventories and how they are distributed.Cameron said Trump had plenty to study when he entered the Oval Office.Bush took a keen interest in preparing the nation for an influenza pandemic after reading John M. Barry’s “The Great Influenza” about the 1918 influenza that killed more than 500,000 Americans and more than 20 million people across the globe.He read the book in 2005 while at his Texas ranch. A few months later, Bush gave a speech at the National Institutes of Health rolling out the first modern-day national strategy to prepare for an influenza pandemic, detect outbreaks, expand vaccine production capacity and stockpile treatments.“Unlike storms or floods, which strike in an instant and then recede, a pandemic can continue spreading destruction in repeated waves that can last for a year or more,” Bush said in the November 2005 speech..Obama worked on the Ebola epidemic and also on H1N1 and the Zika virus. In 2014, Obama stood up the White House’s National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to coordinate government resources in preparation for the next disease outbreak and prevent it from becoming a pandemic.There are scores of other pandemic planning books on the shelves, including the Biological Incident Annex, which was updated by the Obama administration and re-issued in January 2017 as Trump took office. The Pandemic Crisis Action Plan from 2018 that McEnany talked about is not online, but a General Accounting Office report references it.“President Trump has been in office for well over three years now, which is more than enough to build upon the pandemic strategies he inherited,” said Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University who worked with the Bush and Obama administrations on global health issues.“It’s quite evident that whatever pandemic planning had been done during the Bush or Obama administrations never made it to high levels in the Trump administration.”He thinks Trump was just focused on other issues — that pandemic planning wasn’t a top priority for the president.Gostin said he was startled when Trump first said that no one expected a pandemic like Covid-19 to happen.“Well, every global health expert expected this to happen,” Gostin said. “We couldn’t tell you when it would happen. We couldn’t tell you exactly what the pathogen would be, but we always knew that there was a big novel pandemic coming.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-pandemic-planning-becomes-political-weapon-as-deaths-mount/story-6pOBlYbmN3sACMLIe53tdP.html

The statement said there were “multiple clashes.”The military police said officers seized eight rifles, 85 grenades and some narcotics.Five people were pronounced dead at a nearby hospital, while five other bodies were later carried by local residents to the entrance of the Alemao group of slums.The bodies were laid next to one another on the street and drew a small crowd of people, some of whom were not wearing any masks despite the coronavirus pandemic. Family members at the scene cried as they covered the bodies, already wrapped in fabrics, with cardboard boxes to shelter them from the rain.From January through March, police killed 429 people during operations in Rio de Janeiro state, down 1.6% from the same period a year earlier. Homicides have also gone down, declining 0.9% this year to 1,044 victims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-dead-in-gunbattles-during-police-raid-on-rio-slum-complex/story-QcwKgRXT0AIugKIje4XhML.html
16-05-2020||World||Pakistani doctor indicted in Minnesota on terrorism charge||A Pakistani doctor and former Mayo Clinic researcher has been indicted on one count of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization after authorities say he told paid FBI informants that he pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group and wanted to carry out lone wolf attacks in the USThe indictment against Muhammad Masood, 28, was announced Friday by US Attorney Erica MacDonald. Masood was initially charged by criminal complaint and has been in custody since his March 19 arrest at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.Prosecutors say Masood was in the US on a work visa. They allege in court documents that from January to March, Masood made several statements to paid informants — whom he believed were members of the Islamic State group — pledging his allegiance to the group and its leader. He also expressed a desire to travel to Syria to fight for IS and carry out lone wolf attacks in the US, they said.Masood messaged an informant “there is so much I wanted to do here .. .lon wulf stuff you know ... but I realized I should be on the ground helping brothers sisters kids,” according to an FBI affidavit.Prosecutors say Masood planned to leave for Amman, Jordan, and go on to Syria at the end of March, but on March 16 he had to change his travel plans because Jordan closed its borders due to the coronavirus pandemic. Masood and one of the informants then developed a plan for him to fly from Minneapolis to Los Angeles to meet with that informant, whom Masood believed would help him travel in a cargo ship into Islamic State territory.Masood’s attorney didn’t immediately return messages left Friday.Court documents do not name the clinic where Masood worked. The Mayo Clinic has confirmed that Masood formerly worked at the medical center, but said he was not employed there when he was arrested. According to an affidavit supporting the criminal complaint, Masood said in February that he was going to notify his employer that his last day of work would be March 17.The affidavit said the FBI began investigating in January, after learning that someone, later determined to be Masood, had posted messages on an encrypted social media platform indicating an intent to support IS.On Jan. 24, Masood contacted one of the informants on the encrypted platform and said he was a medical doctor with a Pakistani passport and wanted to travel to Syria, Iraq or northern Iran near Afghanistan “to fight on the front line as well as help the wounded brothers,” the affidavit said.Roughly three dozen Minnesotans — mostly men from the state’s large Somali community — have left since 2007 to join al-Shabab in Somalia or militant groups in Syria, including the Islamic State group. Several others have been convicted on terrorism-related charges for plotting to join or provide support to those groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-doctor-indicted-in-minnesota-on-terrorism-charge/story-sgHU08FcsraAdDNDDEcPLN.html

The Air Force previously oversaw offensive and defensive operations in space.Trump’s enthusiasm for Space Force has drawn sporadic criticism and provided fodder for comedians. A satirical Netflix series, “Space Force,” debuts later this month, starring Steve Carell and John Malkovich.The Pentagon’s budget allocated funding for the force, including “space-related weapons systems and operations.” The Space Force’s procurement budget is projected to reach $4.7 billion by fiscal year 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-unveils-space-force-flag-says-us-building-super-duper-missile/story-PKUYfq8rp8eHS29TPpb8SL.html
16-05-2020||World||US adds new sanction to cut off chip supplies to Chinese tech giant Huawei||The U.S. government imposed new restrictions on Chinese tech giant Huawei on Friday, severely limiting its ability to use American technology to design and manufacture semiconductors produced for it abroad.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Friday that the move aims to prevent Huawei from making a run around existing U.S. sanctions.“There has been a very highly technical loophole through which Huawei has been able to in effect use U.S. technology,” Ross told Fox Business. “We never intended that loophole to be there.”Adam Segal, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the move “looks like a victory for the people who really want to drive the nail, or what they think will be the nail, in Huawei’s coffin,” saidThe new restrictions elicited an angry response from China, which threatened retaliation against U.S. companies.Chip design and manufacturing equipment used in the world’s semiconductor plants is mostly U.S. made, so the new rule aims to impact multiple foreign producers that sell to Huawei and affiliates including HiSilicon, which makes chips used in supercomputers with scientific and military uses. The Commerce Department said foreign foundries would be granted a 120-day grace period.Under the new rules, foreign semiconductor makers must obtain a license from U.S. officials in order to ship to Huawei-designed semiconductors to the Chinese company that were produced using U.S. technology.Last year, the Trump administration barred U.S. firms from using Huawei technology or providing technology to the Chinese firm without government approval, deeming it a national security risk. The Commerce Department exempted a narrow list of products and services and has continuously extended that limited waiver, largely to lessen the impact on U.S. wireless carriers that use Huawei technology in their networks. This week, it added another 90 days.The new restrictions are separate from those exemptions, but loopholes have allowed U.S. companies to continue to supply Huawei with chips made outside the U.S.The Commerce Department said in a statement Friday that the new restrictions would “narrowly and strategically” target Huawei’s acquisition of semiconductors that it designs built in overseas foundries that use U.S. software and technology. Kevin Wolf, an attorney at Akin Gump who oversaw export administration at the Commerce Department during the Obama administration, noted the narrow scope of the rules.“If a foreign foundry makes a chip based on a Huawei design and U.S. equipment is used to make a chip then it’s controlled, but if a chip is not made from a Huawei design then it is not controlled,” he said.Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But China’s official Global Times newspaper threatened countermeasures on Friday. It said Beijing that could include restrictions on U.S. companies including Qualcomm, Cisco and Apple. It also threatened to suspend purchases of Boeing aircraft.Global Times noted that the new Commerce rules would block companies such as TSMC, a Taiwainese chip maker, from providing semiconductors to Huawei. TSMC announced plans this week to build a chip plant in Arizona. It did not immediately respond to an Associated Press query on whether the new rules might alter those plans.“It seems the U.S. is ratcheting up efforts to pinch China’s high-tech companies,” the editorial read, calling it more than just an element of President Donald Trump’s re-election strategy. “U.S. suppression has become the No. 1 challenge to China’s development.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-adds-new-sanction-to-cut-off-chip-supplies-to-chinese-tech-giant-huawei/story-BbUStRf157SeySldFD1FMN.html
16-05-2020||World||China firmly denies covering up outbreak, delaying action||China said it did not know until Jan. 19 how infectious the new coronavirus is, pushing back against accusations that it intentionally withheld information about the severity of the outbreak in Wuhan from the world.While Chinese officials knew that there were signs of human-to-human transmission earlier, it was hard to ascertain the new virus’s level of contagiousness, said Zeng Yixin, vice minister of the National Health Commission, at a press briefing in Beijing on Friday. There are diseases like HIV that while infectious, are not easily transmitted from person to person, he said.It was only on Jan. 19 that Chinese scientists concluded that the virus spreads easily among people and China released that information to the world the next day, said Zeng.The accounting of events from top officials came as China faces growing blame for a delay in sounding the alarm about the coronavirus, which allowed people to spread it unwittingly for some time. Zeng was responding to an Associated Press report in April that cited confidential documents showing Chinese officials were internally discussing the possibility of widespread infections six days before President Xi Jinping warned the public of the dangers of the virus.The alleged delay resulted in millions of people traveling from Wuhan to elsewhere in the country and the world, seeding a pandemic that has now sickened over 4.4 million people and killed over 300,000.Giving a rundown of events since the crisis began, Zeng said that China concluded on Jan. 9 that it was dealing with a novel coronavirus and began developing test kits the next day. On Jan. 12, it informed the World Health Organization about the outbreak.On Jan. 14, a national meeting of provincial health officials was held. “Many uncertainties remained. We understood there’s more research needed on human-to-human transmission and we couldn’t rule out the chance of a further spread of the virus,” said Zeng. “But we couldn’t reach conclusions to many questions.”Trump’s WHO Attack Accelerates Breakdown in Global CooperationBesides its alleged delay in disclosing information on the virus outbreak at an earlier stage, China has also faced skepticism about its official tallies of deaths and infections.The pandemic has revived tensions between the world’s two largest economies. China and the US are escalating disputes from visas to supply chains as the two countries continue blaming each other regarding the origins of the virus, a mystery that global experts are trying to unravel.Earlier this month, US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo accused China of covering up the virus by silencing doctors who tried to warn about the disease and ordering that samples be destroyed on Jan. 3. Liu Dengfeng, another NHC official, said that China did issue a document on Jan. 3 about lab safety and that the country’s regulations have clear requirements for how to handle samples, including their destruction.“The comments made by these US officials are taken out of context and intended to confuse the public,” Liu said, adding that China has shared samples with countries including the US, UK and Australia in recent years.Along with the US, countries including Australia and Germany have sought an investigation into how the previously unknown virus made the jump from animals to humans before being discovered in Wuhan last year.What We Don’t Know About Coronavirus Origins Might Kill UsAsked if China rejected a request from the WHO to visit the P4 lab in Wuhan that some have speculated is linked to the virus, NHC official Li Mingzhu said the agency has never asked to visit a particular lab in China and it’s thus “not true” that such a request was turned down.Li wasn’t asked if China would allow access to the lab if a request was made.While the number of infections has dropped dramatically in China, the nation still faces the threat of a second wave after a new cluster emerged in its northeastern region ahead of high-profile political meetings scheduled to convene next week in Beijing.Xi on Thursday called for stronger measures to contain any risk that could undermine the country’s success so far. In Wuhan, officials have been directed to prepare for mass testing the entire population of 11 million after new cases were reported for the first time since the city’s lockdown lifted in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-firmly-denies-covering-up-outbreak-delaying-action/story-fiOeiG7IXLxFn73xxSSeJI.html

Including arrears that stretch back several years, “the United States is the largest debtor, owing 1.165 billion and 1.332 billion US dollars respectively,” China added.ALSO WATCH | Covid: Chinese hackers targeting US vaccine research? Donald Trump respondsThe US is the biggest contributor to the UN budget, paying 22 percent of its annual running costs, a bill which adds up to around $3 billion; and 25 percent of its peacekeeping operations, which amount to some $6 billion a year.Officially, Washington is meant to pay 27.89 percent of the peacekeeping budget, but a decision made by Congress and implemented by President Donald Trump in 2017 cut that payment to 25 percent, meaning Washington runs up an annual shortfall of $200 million.The United States also has a fiscal year that runs from October to October, which can make it look like an even bigger debtor at certain times of the year. The US mission to the UN dismissed the call, saying China is “eager to distract attention from its cover-up and mismanagement of the COVID-19 crisis, and this is yet another example.”It continued: “The United States recently made a payment of $726 million toward its peacekeeping assessment, and per practice will pay the bulk of its assessment at the end of the calendar year.”It said the total peacekeeping arrears was $888 million, adding: “Roughly two-thirds of this amount is the result of payment at the rate of 25 percent from 2017 through the present.”The payment of contributions by member countries for peacekeeping operations has a direct impact on the reimbursements the UN pays to countries that contribute troops to the 15 or so missions around the world.In a report on May 11, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that “there may be significant delays towards the middle of the year, unless the cash position across missions improves significantly.”On Thursday, around 50 of the 193 member states, including China, paid their contributions in full, which Beijing -- the second largest contributor, far behind the United States -- noted in its statement.China pays around 12 percent of the UN’s running costs and around 15 percent of the peacekeeping budget.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/largest-debtor-china-calls-on-us-to-pay-its-debts-to-the-united-nations/story-3GYuSQ0JvK604jd4lJwk1I.html

That requirement has become cumbersome as lawmakers shelter in their homes in an attempt to help limit the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus that has killed more than 85,000 people in the United States.The special procedure is intended to be in effect during the coronavirus crisis.Republicans argued the Democrats’ rules change proposal was unconstitutional and unnecessary.The House is next expected to vote on whether to approve the new emergency aid package - an estimated $3 trillion on top of $3 trillion already enacted - that Republicans also oppose. If passed, the Republican-controlled Senate is expected to block it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-votes-to-allow-proxy-voting-during-coronavirus-crisis/story-izHSsT0aaYQ1o8oBF427RM.html

In an interview with Fox Business Network broadcast on Thursday, Trump said he was very disappointed with China’s failure to contain the coronavirus outbreak and that the pandemic had cast a pall over the trade deal with Beijing that he considers a major achievement.Also Read: Donald Trump hopes for Covid-19 vaccine by end of year, ‘maybe before’Tensions between the world’s two largest economies have spiked in recent weeks, with officials on both sides suggesting the hard-fought trade deal that defused a bitter 18-month trade war could be abandoned.Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, was asked if the trade deal was falling apart. “Absolutely not,” he said. The Chinese are working toward holding up their end of the agreement, which calls for Beijing to boost purchases of American farm goods, manufactured products, energy and services by $200 billion over two years, Kudlow said.“They’re a little slow on the commodity purchases. I think that has a lot to do with market and economic positions,” he said.Also Read: US will donate ventilators to help India fight Covid-19: TrumpKudlow’s comments came at the end of a week of complaints from Trump about China’s early handling of the coronavirus outbreak, and separate steps by his government to crack down on China’s blacklisted telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies

The peak of the crisis has yet to hit Latin America’s largest nation, experts say.Gen. Eduardo Pazuello, who had no health experience until he became the Health Ministry’s No. 2 official in April, will be the interim minister until Bolsonaro chooses a replacement. Brazilian media have said that Teich’s ability to do his job had been weakened by the appointment of dozens of military personnel to jobs in the ministry.Also Read: ‘No benefit’ in hydroxychloroquine virus treatment: Studies“Life is made up of choices and today I decided to leave,” Teich told journalists in capital Brasilia. He did not explain why he left the job and refused to answer questions.Teich’s resignation came one day after Bolsonaro told business leaders in a video conference he would ease rules for use of chloroquine to treat people infected with the coronavirus. Teich has frequently called use of the drug “an uncertainty,” and this week warned of its side effects.The Health Ministry previously allowed chloroquine to be used in coronavirus cases only for patients hospitalized in serious condition.Also Read: 881 single-day deaths, over 1.7 lakh cases: Brazil becoming new Covid-19 hotspotAt Bolsonaro’s urging, the country’s Army Chemical and Pharmaceutical Laboratory boosted chloroquine production in late March.Researchers last month reported no benefit in a large analysis of the drug or a related substance, hydroxychloroquine, in U.S. hospitals for veterans. Last month, scientists in Brazil stopped part of a study of chloroquine after heart rhythm problems developed in one quarter of people given the higher of two doses being tested.Governors who have recommended quarantine measures and refrained from touting the drug’s unproven potential said Teich’s resignation reflects Bolsonaro’s failure to manage the pandemic.Rio de Janeiro Gov. Wilson Witzel, a former ally of Bolsonaro, said “no one can do serious work with interference in ministries.” “That is why governors and mayors need to lead the pandemic crisis, and not you, Mr. President,” Witzel said on Twitter.The governor of Ceara, one of Brazil’s most hard-hit states, said Teich’s exit “brings enormous insecurity and concern.”“It is unacceptable that in the face of this serious health crisis, the focus of the government is still on political and ideological discussions. That is an affront to the nation,” Camilo Santana said.Bolsonaro fired Teich’s predecessor, Mandetta, on April 16 after disagreements over efforts to contain the new coronavirus. The president opposed governors’ quarantine recommendations and restrictions on businesses, was eager to resume economic activity and warned failure to do so would cause Brazil to descend into “chaos”.Mandetta had sided with the governors and became the embodiment of challenges to Bolsonaro’s position. Teich took office pledging to balance health care concerns and the president’s economic worries. He did not openly challenge the president’s views, but did defend stay-at-home measures.Also Read: Bolsonaro fires Brazil’s health minister, calls to reopen economyMiguel Lago, executive director of Brazil’s non-profit Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials, said Teich wasn’t able to build his own team, didn’t have Mandetta’s political strength and wasn’t willing to violate the scientific recommendations.“He clearly had limitations,” Lago said. “He would not challenge what has been consensus among the scientific community. He would never accept the chloroquine thing that Bolsonaro wanted him to do, to recommend publicly that chloroquine was a remedy to be used in the public health system.”Risk consultancy Eurasia Group noted that while governors play a key role in responding to the virus, the Ministry of Health coordinates between states and ensures that “medical equipment is distributed to states with more need. The capacity of an effective coordinating role looks to have dropped with Mandetta’s exit,” analyst Filipe Gruppelli Carvalho said.“Ultimately, Teich’s dismissal reinforces our view of increasing risks from the government’s poor response to the pandemic, which could contribute to a weaker presidency and decline in support for Bolsonaro in the post-pandemic phase,” he said. After Teich’s resignation was announced, pot-banging protests were heard in different regions of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolsonaro-s-love-for-hydroxychloroquine-costs-brazil-another-health-minister/story-jkEFmRFR4sZYneLZxQjb1J.html
16-05-2020||World||Trump donates ventilators to India, says both nations will defeat pandemic||The United States is working with India on developing a vaccine for Covid-19, President Donald Trump said on Friday and recognised Indian-Americans as “great” scientists and researchers, who are contributing in the development of coronavirus vaccine. Addressing media, Trump said he is hopeful a Covid-19 vaccine would be available by the end of the year, and announced to appoint a former head of vaccines at GlaxoSmithKline to spearhead the effort as researchers around the world scramble to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus that has killed more than 300,000 people globally. “I just got back a short while ago from India recently and we are working very much with India and we have a tremendous Indian population in the US and many of the people that you are talking about are working on the vaccine too. Great scientist and researchers,” he told reporters in the Rose Garden of the White House as he unveiled a massive effort to speed track the development of coronavirus vaccine before year end. “Yes. We are working very closely also with India,” Trump said responding to a question. He described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a “very good friend” of him. “India has been so great and as you know your Prime Minister has been a very good friend of mine,” Trump said and later on Twitter announced to donate ventilators to India. “I am proud to announce that the United States will donate ventilators to our friends in India,” he tweeted. “We stand with India” and Prime Minister Modi during this pandemic, he said. “We’re also cooperating on vaccine development. Together we will beat the invisible enemy!” Trump said. The White House did not immediately said as to the number of ventilators that the US is donating to India. This is for the first time probably that a president has recognized the scientific and research talent of the Indian American community. A large number of scientist are engaged in cutting edge research in various aspects of medical science including at the National Institute of Health, Universities, research institutes and bio pharma startups. There are an estimated four million Indian Americans in the United States, of which about 2.5 million are potential voters in the 2020 presidential elections this November. As a presidential candidate, Trump was the first nominee to hold a separate election rally for Indian American in October 2016 in New Jersey. Since then he has described himself as the best friend of India and Indian Americans at the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-donates-ventilators-to-india-says-both-nations-will-defeat-pandemic/story-TmX6HGN6mxVDgfP5TLE3NO.html
16-05-2020||World||Wuhan starts ambitious drive to test its millions||Some eight million residents of Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged late last year, are undergoing the world’s largest mass testing for Covid-19.The campaign to test millions is being closely watched by countries all over the world because of its scale and feasibility. Three million Wuhan residents had already been tested since April, state media reported.The current tests are being carried out five weeks after Wuhan opened up on April 8 after a 76-day lockdown. Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, was badly affected by the outbreak, accounting for over 50,000 infections and around 3,800 deaths.The mass testing is part of China’s efforts to fortify against a potential “second wave” after a cluster of cases emerged in a residential community over the last weekend in Wuhan. Videos of long queues of people lining up in front of residential communities circulated on social media as testing began earlier this week.Medics dressed in protective gear could be seen guiding residents. Notices had been dispatched through local Communist Party of China volunteers to residential communities.Earlier this week, Wuhan authorities said all residents will be tested, but that announcement seems to have been recalibrated.Wuhan will “arrange nucleic acid tests for all residents who have not been tested before, in order to better know the number of asymptomatic cases of the novel coronavirus,” news agency Xinhua reported on Friday.The initial announcement that all tests will be carried out within 10 days has been tweaked as well. Each district of the city will now get 10 days to complete the tests.The decision to carry out large-scale testing was made as Wuhan continued to report asymptomatic infections daily. The priority for the tests are residents who have not been tested before, people living in residential compounds that had previous cases of the virus, as well as old or densely populated estates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-testing-millions-for-covid-19-in-complex-campaign/story-jSXybYhcWUPSuHAHHTGWVO.html
