02-05-2020||World||Italy’s coronavirus toll jumps after non-hospital deaths added in||Italy’s death toll jumped Saturday by the highest number since April 21, after previously uncounted deaths outside hospitals were added in.The 474 fatalities reported by the civil protection service took the Mediterranean country’s total since February to 28,710, second only to the United States.But the toll included 282 uncounted deaths in April that Milan’s Lombardy region said it had reported to the civil protection service on Saturday.The northern region recorded most of Italy’s initial deaths, and its toll now accounts for just under half of the country’s total.Italy’s real number of fatalities is believed to be substantially higher than the official figure because few deaths in care homes or in the community are reported.The elderly in care homes are often not tested for the virus, and the number of people who have died of the illness at home is unknown.Italy’s general trends two days before it begins gradually rolling back its lockdown on Monday were positive.The 192 new deaths were the lowest since March 14, and the number of new virus infections stood at 1,900, about a third of the number at the peak of the crisis.zak/ach||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-s-coronavirus-toll-jumps-after-non-hospital-deaths-added-in/story-yiCUHS24nyNvKH7gao2k5I.html
02-05-2020||World||Deaths due to coronavirus in UK mount to 28,131: Report||The UK on Saturday announced 621 more deaths in the coronavirus outbreak, taking the overall cumulative toll to 28,131, just behind Europe’s worst-hit country Italy.The government said that 182,260 people had tested positive for Covid-19, up 4,806 on Friday. But hospital admissions had fallen, it added.Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday said the country had “past the peak” of the virus, as he comes under mounting pressure to ease lockdown restrictions imposed in late March.A review is expected this Thursday and Johnson said the government would outline a plan to lift social distancing measures that would keep transmissions rates down.“The very strong advice today is that moment has not yet come,” housing minister Robert Jenrick told a daily briefing on the government’s response to the outbreak.In the meantime, the public should remain at home except to shop for essential groceries, medicine or to exercise, he added.The government aims to keep transmission rates down by a wider testing regime, and also through contact tracing of people who have been in proximity with someone infected.Just under 106,000 tests were carried on Friday, Jenrick said.Britain was initially criticised for its light-touch approach to the growing pandemic but introduced stricter measures after scientists warned of mass casualties.The country’s overall death toll jumped mid-week after a change in reporting, by including deaths in all settings, including hospitals, care homes and the wider community.That saw numbers surge past Spain and France. It is now just behind Italy, which as of 1530 GMT on Saturday had 28,236 deaths, according to an AFP tally of official sources.The United States remains the worst-affected, with 65,173 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deaths-due-to-coronavirus-in-uk-mount-to-28-131-report/story-QL1nPeUyXfHmyVi7WYhdjI.html
02-05-2020||World||Singapore to ease some coronavirus curbs over next few weeks||Singapore will start easing coronavirus restrictions over the next few weeks, authorities said on Saturday, as the city-state takes the first tentative steps towards reopening its economy.Businesses such as home-based enterprises, laundry services and barbershops will be allowed to reopen from May 12. A week later, some students will be allowed to go back to schools in small groups.Officials say workplaces will be allowed to reopen gradually, taking into account their importance to the economy and supply chains, as well as their ability to minimise the risk of infection.Singapore is facing the deepest recession in its 55-year history, compounded by so-called “circuit breaker” restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of the novel coronavirus that are due to last until June 1.“We are preparing for the safe and gradual resumption of economic and community activities after the end of the circuit breaker period on 1 June 2020,” the ministry of health said in a statement. Singapore has among the highest number of coronavirus infections in Asia, mainly due to outbreaks in cramped migrant-worker dormitories. It has managed to curb the spread of the disease among locals outside the dormitories. On Saturday, officials confirmed 447 new infections, the smallest daily rise in two weeks, taking the total to 17,548. It also reported the death of a 76-year-old man, taking the total death toll to 17.Of the new confirmed cases, 431 involve migrant workers living in dormitories and four are Singaporeans or permanent residents, the health ministry said.The average daily number of new cases outside the migrant worker dormitories has dropped by more than half to 12 in the past week, from 25 the week before, the ministry said on Friday.Authorities said SafeEntry, a digital check-in system to log details of visitors and employees, will be deployed extensively across the country to help with contact tracing.The government said the measures could still be adjusted depending on the situation, and that people should continue to stay at home and not meet in groups.“Even as we ease and adjust some of these measures, the bottom line is this - this is not the time to slacken and let our guard down,” Singapore minister Lawrence Wong, who co-heads the country’s virus fighting taskforce, told a media briefing. “We’re not out of the woods,” he said.

02-05-2020||World||In US, Ramadan amid Covid-19 crisis presents both obstacles, opportunities||For Muslims in the United States, there is no other time more centered around gathering in congregation than the holy month of Ramadan. In every corner of the country, believers attend community iftar meals to break the fast and then pack neatly into tight rows for nightly prayers at the mosque. On weekends, especially, some may linger longer as they catch up, share in the pre-dawn suhoor meal and line up again for the fajr, dawn, prayers.But this year, Ramadan falls during a global pandemic. In the US, with the world’s highest Covid-19 death toll, that means being forced to mark the month in different, more virtual and sometimes solitary ways.As they re-imagine some of the spiritual and social rituals, many are relying on a mix of at-home worship and a myriad of online religious programming. Virtual iftar options have sprung up so the devout don’t have to break their fast alone. But not all moments can be recreated on a screen. There will be dishes not shared, prayers not lifted together, hugs not given.Around the country, Muslims are adapting to the unprecedented challenges.HOUSTON: RICARDO RAMIREZ, 28Ricardo Ramirez became a Muslim before a crowd of believers.As soon as he uttered the shahada, the Islamic testimony of faith, the faithful broke into chants of “Allahu Akbar.” He was told that day that “all of these brothers and sisters are your brothers and sisters.”Since then, he says, the community has been there for him. But Ramirez is experiencing a milestone in his faith journey — his first Ramadan as a Muslim — as the virus disrupts worship and mosques close.“It’s going to be really difficult,” he said before Ramadan started. “I do have a lot of questions, and there’s a lot I want to observe and ask about.”Born in Texas to parents of Mexican descent, Ramirez was baptized Catholic before converting. In the compulsory solitude, he’s determined to find strength. “The more I think about it, I think this is the path that Allah has set for me as a challenge ... to know that this religion is for me.”CHICAGO: JUMANA AZAM, 33On Ramadan’s first day, respiratory therapist Jumana Azam slept through her alarm for suhoor. She had come home at 2 a.m. from an odd shift at the hospital. Still, when she woke up, she set her intention to fast, ignoring the doubts of whether she’d be able to keep it throughout the day.Then she changed back into scrubs and left to start another shift in the ICU of Rush University Medical Center.As Chicago experienced a surge of Covid-19 patients in early April, Azam’s days quickly turned into 16-hour shifts, with barely a break to eat or make one of the five daily prayers.Last year, Azam, like many other professional Muslims observing the month, decreased her working hours slightly to make the days more manageable. This year, she knows that won’t be possible. Still, Azam is planning to wake up each morning to eat before dawn and try.“I’m going to take it in stages and try to fast while I’m at work,” she says. “But if I feel like I’m getting light-headed, I’m going to have to break it.”NEW YORK CITY: IMAM MUFTI MOHAMMED ISMAIL, 38The An-Noor Cultural Center and masjid, or mosque, is located blocks from Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, where patients have been dying from Covid-19 at an alarming rate.The immigrant-rich neighborhood has been deemed one of New York City’s hardest-hit areas. Imam Mufti Mohammed Ismail is the principal of the religious school at An-Noor.A prayer of “protection from diseases” is printed in Arabic and English on a paper posted to the mosque wall, and Ismail says the Bangladeshi community has lost “close to 150 people” to Covid-19 across New York City.As deaths rise, Imam Ismail is trying to serve community members suffering in other ways. With mosques shuttered as the city reels, volunteers from An-Noor Cultural Center are preparing food boxes for those who would have relied on the center for iftar every evening.On this day, volunteers load food into a car and head off to begin deliveries. Imam Ismail says this gives the center the opportunity to fulfill one of Ramadan’s tenets — to serve those less fortunate, regardless of religion. “Once we receive a call asking for help, we never question about the caller’s faith. It’s just a family,” he says. “A human being. We are ready to serve them.”MINNEAPOLIS: IMAM SHARIF MOHAMEDFor all the things Muslims are doing without this year, one community in Minneapolis has gained a new voice during the holy month: the call to prayer.Throughout Ramadan, the azan, or adhan — which summons the faithful for prayers five times a day — will be broadcast over loudspeakers for the first time at the Dar Al-Hijrah Mosque.Mayor Jacob Frey facilitated the noise permit after community leaders requested the service. For Muslims feeling isolated at home, the sound of the azan will offer connection, says Imam Sharif Mohamed.“It’s calming and soothing for them,” he says. “The emotional and spiritual connection, I think, is beyond our imagination.”WHEELING, ILLINOIS: SHAHEEN KHAN, 54Over the last six weeks, Shaheen Khan has gotten more comfortable sitting in front of the camera and conducting online Islamic lessons.The 54-year-old mother of four teaches at the Hadi School, a Montessori Islamic school in Schaumburg, Illinois, that provides Islamic teachings according to the Shia tradition.Khan arrived in the US from India in 1990 and has been teaching ever since. But in 30 years, she’s never had to face the challenge of connecting with her students remotely day after day.Of the time at home, she says this: “Maybe this is Allah’s way of resetting a button for us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-us-ramadan-amid-covid-19-crisis-presents-both-obstacles-opportunities/story-aGaoNkM5V1dnaprDvSxoRJ.html
02-05-2020||World||Donald Trump revises US Covid-19 toll estimate again to ‘hopefully under 100,000’||President Donald Trump on Friday revised the estimate of US fatalities from Covid-19 to “hopefully” less than 100,000, just days after he said he feared it could go up to 60,000 and then to 70,000. His first estimate based on projections by his coronavirus task force was up to 200,000.As of Saturday morning, US toll stood at 65,068, with 1,947 new fatalities in the last 24 hours and the number of confirmed cases had climbed to 1.1 million, with 34,037 new reported infections.The Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), whose projections are widely cited by public health officials and experts including member of the president’s task force on the coronavirus, has estimated 72,433 fatalities based on current levels of mitigation efforts.The American president has tried to get ahead of the pandemic, which he had once dismissed as something that will “disappear” like a “miracle”. Trump has also used these statements to claim credit for himself and his administration for acting in time and aggressively enough to have prevented many more death, even though US remains the nation which has recorded the highest death toll due to coronavirus, followed by Italy which is the second-hardest hit country. “Through our aggressive response and the remarkable commitment and bravery of American people, we have saved thousands and thousands of lives,” the president told reporters Friday before heading out to Camp David, the presidential retreat in adjoining Maryland state.He added: “People were thinking in terms of 1.5 million lives lost to 2.2 without the mitigation. And hopefully, we’re going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number nevertheless.”The estimate of 1.5 million to 2.2 million came from the White House task force on the coronavirus and was based on assumptions that the government did nothing to combat the outbreak. With all mitigation efforts fully in force, the task force had projected 120,000 to 200,000 deaths.To keep a tight control on its narrative on the handling of the outbreak, the White House has blocked Anthony Fauci, a top government epidemiologist and member of the coronavirus task force, from testifying before a congressional committee. It has said making key officials fighting the outbreak appear at hearings will be “counterproductive” at this point.But all projections have been significantly lowered with the enforcement of mitigation efforts such as stay-at-home orders and social-distancing guidelines.With continued drop in new cases, hospitalization and intubation, many states have started easing these restrictions. Texas became Friday the largest state to roll back some of the curbs. Stores, restaurants, movie theaters, malls, museums and libraries were allowed to reopen with limited occupancy to ensure social-distancing.Other states such as California and Michigan, which have been hit hard by the epidemic, are being more careful and have tightened restrictions. Beaches and some public parks have been closed in California indefinitely and Michigan has extended the lockdown to May 15 despite mounting protests.The situation in New York, the epicenter of the American epidemic with more than 24,000 fatalities, continues to improve but the scale of the devastation in the state and New York City, where close to 18,400 people have died thus far, has continued to unfold.A New York city nursing home on Friday reported the death of 98 inmates from Covid-19 over a period of time. “It’s absolutely horrifying,” Mayor Bill de Blasio has said. “It’s inestimable loss, and it’s just impossible to imagine so many people lost in one place.” Earlier in the week 100 bodies were found decomposing in two unrefrigerated trucks outside a funeral home in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-revises-covid-19-toll-estimate-again-to-hopefully-under-100-000/story-iJdlGbD4mmeJpnQre3SrUO.html

02-05-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson’s son named after doctors who ‘saved’ his life||Boris Johnson and his fiancée Carrie Symonds have named their newborn son Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas, partly as a tribute to two of the intensive care doctors who they said had saved the British leader’s life as he battled COVID-19 complications.Symonds announced the name on Saturday on Instagram beside a picture of her and the boy - who already has thick hair resembling the blond thatch of his father.Symonds, 32, said Wilfred, who was born on Wednesday, was named after Johnson’s grandfather while Lawrie came from her grandfather.Nicholas, Symonds said, was a nod to Nick Price and Nick Hart - two doctors who the couple have praised for saving Johnson’s life at St Thomas’ hospital last month.“I couldn’t be happier,” Symonds said, adding her thanks to the maternity staff of University College London Hospital. “My heart is full.”Johnson, 55, returned to work on Monday after recuperating from COVID-19, which had left him gravely ill in intensive care at the peak of the coronavirus outbreak. He thanked the doctors at St Thomas’ hospital whom, he said, had “saved my life, no question”.Symonds, a former public relations executive, also had symptoms of the virus but recovered more swiftly. She had said in February that the baby was due in early summer.Johnson, who was present at the birth, will take a short period of paternity leave later in the year.BABY IN DOWNING STREETSymonds and Johnson have been living together in Downing Street since he became prime minister in July. They announced in February they were expecting their first child and that they were engaged to be married.Once dubbed “Bonking Boris” by Britain’s tabloid media, Johnson has had a complicated private life.He was once sacked from the Conservative Party’s policy team while in opposition for lying about an extra-marital affair. He has been divorced twice and refuses to say how many children he has fathered.In 2013, when Johnson was mayor of London, appeal court judges ruled that the public had the right to know he had an extra-marital affair with a woman who gave birth to his daughter.Johnson’s previous marriage was to Marina Wheeler, a lawyer. They had four children together but announced in September 2018 that they had separated. They divorced earlier this year.Few British leaders have had babies while in office.David Cameron’s wife, Samantha, gave birth to their daughter, Florence, in 2010 and Tony Blair’s wife, Cherie, gave birth to their son, Leo, in 2006.Before that, Frances, the wife of John Russell, a 19th-Century Whig and Liberal politician, gave birth to two children in 1848 and 1849 while he was in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-s-son-named-after-doctors-who-saved-his-life/story-ifO8QVub7Sy6hgNNA8qF7L.html
02-05-2020||World||Covid-19: France extends health emergency until July 24||France on Saturday decided to extend a health emergency imposed to fight the new coronavirus for another two months until July 24, Health Minister Olivier Veran said.A proposal to go before parliament from Monday says the lifting this month of the emergency, which began on March 24, would “be premature” and “could see a risk of the outbreak” intensifying.The bill also lays out the quarantine conditions for people coming to France from abroad.“We are going to have to live with the virus for a while,” Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said after a cabinet meeting.“Learning to live with the virus, that’s what’s at stake in the coming months.”The proposals cover an “information system” for those have the virus and their entourage that would operate for up to a year.The bill will go before the Senate on Monday and the National Assembly most probably the day after, said government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye.France is one of the European countries most impacted by the virus and lists 24,594 deaths from 167,346 confirmed cases.The government has announced the gradual lifting of some lockdown measures from May 11, including the reopening of primary schools.The bill will also cover aspects of the lifting of the lockdown, Veran said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-france-extends-health-emergency-until-july-24/story-wtGThfJD2jkAGAPgcmpXNK.html

Two criminal petitions were filed by lawyer Faisal Siddiqi on behalf of the parents—Ruth Pearl and Judie Pearl—against the acquittal and release of the four accused.“The decision by the Sindh High Court to free the men in the murder of Daniel Pearl is a complete miscarriage of justice. It is a defining case for the Pakistani state and its judicial system, involving freedom of the press, the sanctity of every life, freedom from terror and the manifestation of a welcoming and safe Pakistan to the world. Rarely has any court case embodied and risked such fundamental values,” Siddiqi said.Also Read: US concerns natural, will challenge acquittal of Daniel Pearl murder convicts: QureshiThe petition states that the Sindh high court had failed to note that this was a brutal murder as a result of international terrorism and the principle of the standard of proof, as well as the benefit of doubt in cases of international terrorism, has to be applied keeping in the context that the nature and type of evidence available in such terrorism cases cannot be equated with cases involving non-terrorism crimes.The petition further submitted that the high court also erred in failing to take into consideration that Ahmad Omar Sheikh had a history of involvement in international terrorism.Also Read: Pakistan court overturns murder conviction in Daniel Pearl casePearl, who worked for the Wall Street Journal, went missing in Karachi in January 2002.

02-05-2020||World||US gives emergency-use authorization to Covid-19 treatment drug||The US drug regulator on Friday granted emergency use authorization for doctors to prescribe remdesivir, an antiviral medicine made by American pharmaceutical major Gilead Sciences Inc, for the treatment currently of hospitalized adults and children with severe coronavirus infection.The Food and Drug Administration, the regulator, said that though there is limited information available about the safety and effectiveness of the drug, it has been seen to shorten the recovery time in some patients.President Donald Trump announced with the emergency use authorization with a full-court briefing at the White House Friday accompanied by top officials of his coronavirus task force and the Gilead CEO Dan O’Day.The president called the drug the “hot thing” and “an important treatment for hospitalized coronavirus patients” and a “promising situation”.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe US drug regulator has said the emergency use authorization allows for remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalized with severe disease, which it defined as patients with low blood oxygen levels or needing oxygen therapy or more intensive breathing support such as a mechanical ventilator.The emergency use authorization was a much anticipated development after the president and the top US government epidemiologist declared positive outcome earlier in the week about form the clinical trial underway.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak“The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” Anthony Fauci, the top epidemiologist and member of President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task-force told reporters, prefacing the announcement as “quite good news”.The trial, which was conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that Fauci leads, showed “a drug can block the virus”, Fauci added and described it as “a new standard of care” for treating Covid-19.He had gone on to compare development to the trial 36 years ago in 1986 that led to the HIV antiviral AZT, a drug that had then shown only “modest” efficacy but became the base for better and more improved treatments over the years.Remdesivir is not a vaccine and cannot prevent Covid-19.

02-05-2020||World||‘It’s up to you’, Italians told as lockdown end nears||Italy’s emergency response commissioner Domenico Arcuri begged Italians on Saturday not to lower their guards as the country prepares to ease the world’s longest coronavirus lockdown.“On Monday, Phase Two begins. We have to be aware that it will be the start of an even bigger challenge,” Arcuri said.After a two-month shut down to combat a virus that has killed over 28,000 people, Italians will be allowed to stroll in parks and visit relatives. Restaurants can open for takeout and wholesale stores can resume business.Scientists will be closely monitoring the virus contagion rate as the lockdown lifts and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said it may be reintroduced in locally if the numbers begin to rise significantly again.Arcuri confirmed the “relative freedom” Italians were about to win could be taken away again for health reasons.“We must maintain social distancing, maximum hygiene levels, and masks. We’ve done our bit to the best of our ability. From Monday, it’s up to you,” he said at a press conference.“I implore you, do not lower your guards.”Some 150,000 people will have their blood tested next week for the new coronavirus as authorities attempt to get a clearer picture of its spread as the lockdown eases. Those tests were expected to begin Monday.Arcuri said the government had also bought over five million swabs to be distributed to the regions.Masks costing just 50 cents due to a cap set by the government would go on sale in 50,000 shops, from pharmacies to tobacconists, starting Monday. That figure would rise to 100,000 shops by mid month.Italy would be producing four million masks a day by mid June, 25 million by mid July and 35 million by mid August, Arcuri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-s-up-to-you-italians-told-as-lockdown-end-nears/story-s4kiQxVODGEh5deRNkC0YK.html
02-05-2020||World||When lockdowns led Newton, Darwin, Milton to new highs||Millions across the globe are finding creative and not-so-creative ways to face the challenge of being hunkered down in homes, but there have been times when such periods of isolation and quarantine helped discover field-defining knowledge and create art.For example, Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, John Milton and Lord Byron used the time to add to their formidable body of work in science and literature. It was not called ‘lockdown’ in their time, but they spent long spells in isolation, when medicine was not as developed as now.The University of Cambridge, where they studied, delved into its archives to collate their activities during such periods of isolation centuries ago. It has also asked its alumni to send accounts of how they are spending time in the coronavirus pandemic.Isaac Newton (Trinity College): Considered Trinity’s most accomplished alumni, he was also a poster-child for productivity during a pandemic. Like many in Cambridge during the Great Plague of 1665-6, he retreated to the countryside to escape the disease-ridden city and spent two extended periods at his family home in rural Lincolnshire, Woolsthorpe Manor.Newton thrived in isolation, and later described it as one of the most productive times in his life, finding the space to reflect on and develop his theories on optics, calculus, and the laws of motion and gravity. It was during this time that he conducted his famous prism experiment.“Probably to his parents’ displeasure, he bored a hole through his window shutters to produce a single, thin beam of light to pass through two prisms, proving for the first time that prisms did not create colours, but merely separated colours that were already there made up of a colour spectrum”, the university’s researcher Alisha Matthewson-Grand wrote.“Indeed, Newton was so intellectually transformed by his period of isolation that later commentators have referred to his time away from Cambridge as his annus mirabilis, or his ‘year of wonders’.”Charles Darwin (Christ’s College): Darwin’s experience with isolation was not the result of a pandemic but his own chronic ill health. He suffered from a myriad of unexplained symptoms, including vertigo, vomiting, cramps, fatigue, anxiety and visual disturbances.He noted in his autobiography of 1876 that “few persons can have lived a more retired life than we (Darwin and his wife Emma) have done. Besides short visits to the houses of relations, and occasionally to the seaside or elsewhere, we have gone nowhere.”Darwin believed that periods of isolation and ill health helped his career. At home, he was free from the demands placed on other scientists (teaching, administrative work), and thus able to devote himself entirely to research; he wrote: “Ill-health, though it has annihilated several years of my life, has saved me from the distractions of society and amusement.”Lord Byron (Trinity College): In 1811, Lord Byron was forced to quarantine in Malta after returning from a cholera-ravaged Greece. He was furious at the prospect of spending 40 days in lockdown, a measure he considered to be draconian and unnecessary.While confined, he wrote ‘Farewell to Malta’, a satirical poem attacking the island for (among other things) ‘its smoky towns and cloudy sky’ and its ‘cursed street of stairs’. He references his quarantine explicitly in the first verse ‘Adieu, thou damned’st quarantine, / That gave me fever, and the spleen!’.John Milton (Christ’s College): The author of ‘Paradise Lost’ and ‘Aeropagitica’ spent some time away from Cambridge as a first year undergraduate in 1626, when the town was hit by bubonic plague. He was home in London when he wrote ‘Elegia Prima’, his first Latin elegy. The work is an early example of his aptitude for verse composition, as well as his impressive comedic flair.A letter in verse form, the elegy was written for his closest friend Charles Diodati, and details how Milton was enjoying his unexpected period away from Cambridge while also anticipating his return to ‘the reedy fens of the Cam’ and ‘the hum of the noisy school.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-lockdowns-led-newton-darwin-milton-to-new-highs/story-IsrStGgbHHS3ZCdvILSfBJ.html

Swedish public broadcaster SVT said he had been registered since January at the Uppsala University, the Nordic region’s oldest university, studying Arabic language and acting as a lecturer.Hussain was openly critical of the Pakistani government, and the Swedish chapter of Reporters Without Borders had raised concerns that his disappearance could have been due to his work.In a statement published on Friday, the Balochistan Times said its staff was “deeply saddened by the demise of our dear friend and the founder of this magazine.”“As a journalist, he (Hussain) was compassionate and wrote extensively on the suffering of the Baloch people. His work often got him into trouble as the authorities did not like his reporting of Balochistan’s forbidden stories, the reason he had to leave and live in exile,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-journalist-who-reported-on-atrocities-in-balochistan-found-dead/story-CBlv8kNpsv8fwmWSUCK2aL.html

Britain’s welfare state and its National Health Service was set up after the Second World War.Henderson said that, as a result of the latest crisis, “many of those who work in the lowest-paid roles are in fact the key to our survival and these people who have been undervalued for so long have shown astonishing dedication when we have needed them the most.”Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicEton, founded in 1440 and England’s most exclusive school, has educated 20 British prime ministers, including Boris Johnson.Former pupils include Prince William and Prince Harry, respectively second and sixth in line to the British throne, as well as author George Orwell and economist John Maynard Keynes.For centuries seen as a bastion of privilege where rulers of the British empire were trained, the boarding school in 2020 has sought to cast itself as a champion of academic excellence while helping those less fortunate than most of its wealthy pupils. Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakHenderson, who was educated at Winchester College, another elite school, said he wanted to challenge the notion that Eton was a byword for elitism.Eton will invest 100 million pounds ($125 million) over five years to help disadvantaged children in East Anglia, the Midlands and the north. The money will come from Eton’s charitable endowment and fundraising, The Times said.Henderson said Eton could be castigated in political debate about inequality likely to follow the outbreak. He also said the latest crisis hit poorest hardest and was widening inequalityy.With children stuck at home, he said the most vulnerable would “flatline or regress if they haven’t been in school for many months, are living in cramped homes and don’t have access to computers.”Opponents of Britain’s two-tier education system, where some parents spend small fortunes on on high-achieving, fee-paying schools, while most children attend state-funded schools of varying quality have called abolishing the charitable status of such fee-paying schools that gives such schools tax benefits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-shines-a-light-on-inequality-britain-s-elite-eton-college-says/story-QmaCkurNrZNcKv4H947PAJ.html

These funds will promote American foreign policy interests by supporting shorter-term mitigation efforts and addressing second-order impacts from the pandemic in the long term, across a variety of sectors.More than USD 130 million in humanitarian assistance from the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account, provided through the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration. These funds will help international organisations and NGO partners address challenges posed by the pandemic in refugee, IDP, and hosting communities as well as other migrants and other vulnerable people in both global and local humanitarian responses.This new assistance is in addition to the over USD 100 billion in global health funding and nearly USD 70 billion in overseas humanitarian assistance provided by the US in the last decade alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-commits-over-775-million-to-assist-nations-combat-covid-19-report/story-s7uhGEWg8QDw8aK0JjRfdI.html
02-05-2020||World||Iran reports lowest coronavirus infections since March 10||Iran said Saturday there was a “clear drop” in the number of new coronavirus infections as it reported 802 fresh cases, the lowest daily count since March 10.The new cases brought to 96,448 the number recorded in Iran since it announced its first cases in mid-February.“This shows a clear drop in the number of new infections compared to recent weeks, despite our active testing,” health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said on state television.He added that 77,350 of those hospitalised have since been discharged, claiming it is a “one of the highest recovery percentages in the world.”New deaths from Covid-19 rose slightly to 65 in the past 24 hours, reaching a total of 6,156, Jahanpour said.Doubts have been cast over Iran’s coronavirus figures by experts and officials both at home and abroad.Iran’s deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi warned that the fall in the number of infections could quickly reverse.“I emphasise that this steady decline is fragile,” said Harirchi, who has himself recovered from COVID-19.“Carelessness in gatherings, reopening (businesses) and observing health protocols can make the country face serious problems again.”He also called on the government to increase health sector spending, which he said had been hit by fiscal pressures resulting from sweeping US sanctions and the global economic contraction sparked by the coronavirus.Iran has tried to contain the spread of the virus by shutting schools, universities, cinemas and stadiums among other public spaces since March.But it has allowed a phased reopening of its economy since April 11, and authorities are now mulling allowing sports, cultural and religious centres too.Tehran authorities, who have kept public transportation running despite warnings from health experts, made it mandatory for passengers to wear masks as of Saturday.The virus has not spared public figures, with at least 12 current or former government officials or lawmakers dead and more infected.One of the most senior -- parliament speaker Ali Larijani -- made his first public appearance in a month on Saturday, donning a protetive mask to attend a televised meeting alongside the president and the head of the judiciary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-reports-lowest-coronavirus-infections-since-march-10/story-eSVlOooySii8aaxs8dyrhN.html
02-05-2020||World||Islamic State attack kills 10 Iraqi fighters north of Baghdad||Ten Iraqi paramilitaries were killed in Islamic State group attacks north of Baghdad overnight, security forces said Saturday, the deadliest operation by jihadist sleeper cells in months.Iraq declared IS defeated in late 2017 but remnants of the group still wage hit-and-run attacks on security forces in remote areas of the north and west. Early Saturday, the jihadists attacked fighters of Iraq’s Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force stationed outside a town about 180 kilometres (110 miles) north of Baghdad, according to a statement by Iraq’s security forces.“Six fighters were killed. As another unit was dispatched to reinforce them, an explosive device detonated on that convoy and killed three fighters,” the statement said.A 10th fighter was killed in a separate IS attack on nearby unit from the Hashed, a network of armed groups incorporated into the regular army chain of command. A security source in Salahaddin province, where the attack took place, told AFP that the first IS ambush took place just before midnight. “All the Iraqi security forces manning the checkpoint were killed. F16 planes are flying overhead to search for the IS fighters,” the source said. The attack was IS’s deadliest in several months and appeared to cap a period of more numerous and aggressive operations.Last week, the jihadists claimed a suicide attack that wounded four outside an intelligence headquarters in the northern province of Kirkuk. “The group’s attacks have seemingly grown bolder over the past month or so, as it’s increasingly launched direct assaults on Iraqi security forces and carried out some daytime attacks,” Sam Heller, an independent analyst focused on IS and Iraq, told AFP. “Last night’s attack, if it was in fact coordinated between several IS units, would mark a new escalation by the group,” he added.IS overran around a third of Iraq in 2014, triggering the creation of both a US-led coalition to defeat the jihadists and the Hashed, comprised mostly of Shiite units with ties to Iran -- Iraq’s neighbour but a foe to Washington. The two forces are at odds in Iraq, as the US blames hardline Hashed factions for deadly rocket attacks on its troops while the Hashed and allied politicians have demanded US troops leave the country. In recent months, the coalition has pulled back from five bases where it had been deployed to help track down IS sleeper cells, saying the Iraqi military could largely finish the fight on their own.The coalition is still backing Iraqi troops with air strikes, intelligence and surveillance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-attack-kills-10-iraqi-fighters-north-of-baghdad/story-udkzt5UHxlOlJ4EDAAuF2N.html

The death toll nationwide rose to 1,222 after 57 people died in the last 24 hours, Russia’s coronavirus crisis response centre said, after revising the previous day’s tally.Russia has been in partial lockdown, aimed at curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus, since the end of March. In Moscow, people who have not obtained a special permit for free movement, are only able to leave their homes to shop, walk their dogs and dispose of garbage.President Vladimir Putin has ordered the restrictive measures, called non-working days, to continue until May 11 inclusive, when the country finishes celebrating the Labour Day and Victory Day holidays.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicDespite a relatively low number of cases and deaths compared to the United States, Italy and Spain, which have been hit hardest by the disease, Russia’s infection curve has not reached a plateau.Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin issued an appeal on Saturday to Muscovites to continue to self-isolate. He said the number of critically ill patients is rising, but not as steeply worst-case scenario projections.“However, it is obvious that the threat is on the rise,” he said in his blog.Sobyanin told Rossiya-1 TV station that the Moscow authorities may cut the number of digital permits issued for travel across the city if the situation worsens.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakPrime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, the second-most senior official in the country after Putin, told the president on Thursday that he had tested positive for coronavirus and that he was temporarily stepping down to recover.First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov is now serving as acting prime minister in his absence.On Friday, another member of the Russian cabinet, Construction Minister Vladimir Yakushev, announced he had been diagnosed with the virus and that he would be treated in hospital.

02-05-2020||World||The art of re-emergence: Kim Jong Un appears after long gap||When North Korea broke a three-week silence on leader Kim Jong Un’s public activity on Saturday, it offered no clue where he has been during a period of intense global speculation about his health and whereabouts, or why he was hidden from the public for so long. Instead, state media simply showed him surrounded by aides and appearing confident at a gleaming fertiliser factory that is believed by outside experts to be part of a secret nuclear-weapons programme.While much remains a mystery about Kim’s condition, the abrupt re-emergence of the relaxed and smiling leader was clear choreography of key messages from the secretive government: Kim is the supreme leader in full control of a drive to improve the impoverished country’s food security and economy, amid tough international sanctions and the threat of the new coronavirus.CENTRE OF WORLD NEWSThe official Rodong Sinmun newspaper devoted three of its six pages on Saturday to touting Kim’s leadership, crediting him for what it called prosperity and self-reliance.Reuters could not verify the accuracy of official accounts or the authenticity of pictures from the event.The sprawling complex is the result of Kim’s vision to build a modern factory that will support agricultural production and make progress in automating its chemical industry, Pak Pong Ju, a party elder and a loyal aide to Kim, said at the ribbon-cutting where Kim reappeared.North Korea is under sanctions over its nuclear-weapons and missile programmes, leaving the country chronically struggling with food shortages, aggravated by bad weather and mismanagement.Also Read: Why North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s health mattersKim’s appearance at the Sunchon fertiliser plant, which official media said occurred on Friday, was an example of “field guidance” - a key part of Kim’s public persona, where he presides over an event at a major industrial or social project, or at other times at military drills involving strategic weapons such as ballistic missiles or tactical warfare.His second public visit this year to the site 50 km (30 miles) north of the capital Pyongyang included a sizeable audience of officials from the army, the ruling Workers’ Party and the local community. Many wore face masks in an apparent precaution against the coronavirus.“Agricultural production is a top priority, which has a direct impact on the lives of the people,” Koh Yu-hwan, the president of the Korea Institute for National Unification, a South Korean government think-tank, said. Koh said Kim’s sudden return was “a strategy to be in the centre of world news without resorting to nuclear or missile tests.”THE ENTOURAGEThe makeup of Kim’s entourage featured familiar faces at such events, including two at the forefront of the North’s years-long drive to improve economic conditions: former premier Pak Pong Ju, who is Kim’s deputy at the State Affairs Commission, and Pak’s successor as premier, Kim Jae Ryong.The pair had accompanied Kim on his last major field guidance, the March groundbreaking of the General Hospital in Pyongyang. To Kim Jong Un’s immediate right on the podium was his sister, Kim Yo Jong, a vice director of the party’s Central Committee and unofficially her brother’s chief of staff. SECRET PROJECTThe phosphate fertiliser factory in Sunchon, under construction since June 2017, has received much attention from North Korea’s leaders, with multiple visits by Kim Jae Ryong and Pak. International observers say the plant is part of the North’s clandestine pursuit of uranium extraction for use in nuclear weapons, as the mineral can be a byproduct of making phosphate fertiliser. Also Read: North Korea’s Kim Jong Un makes first appearance in nearly three weeks: ReportThere is strong evidence the factory is involved in uranium extraction, said a report this month by the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, based in California, in line with Kim’s policy of pursuing economic and military strength.The North is motivated to use the plant because it is cost-effective and can easily conceal uranium enrichment, which Pyongyang has long sought to hide, the report said. Uranium enrichment offers an alternative to plutonium processing as a fuel for nuclear weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-art-of-re-emergence-kim-jong-un-appears-after-long-gap/story-we0v9Y5tPwr6EeRcjrPREJ.html

Spaniards get outside to exercise after 49 days of lockdown||Joggers and cyclists across Spain emerged from their homes early on Saturday, with adults allowed out for exercise for the first time in seven weeks as the government began easing coronavirus restrictions.In Barcelona, runners and cyclists crowded paths near the beach, while surfers and paddle-boarders were out enjoying the waves.Mar Visser, 45, who lost her job as an events organiser, was jogging along the path in Castelldefels, a town near Barcelona. “I have been longing for this. It beats running in my house or doing yoga or Pilates inside,” she said. In Madrid, cyclists and skateboarders streamed along the city’s wide boulevards, ducking under police tape set up to prevent people congregating in common areas. Hit by one of the world’s worst Covid-19 outbreaks, Spain imposed a strict lockdown in March, confining most of the population to their homes for all but essential trips.Sports and recreational walks were banned as authorities scrambled to stop the disease from spreading and ease the burden on the stricken healthcare system. Charlotte Fraser-Prynne, 41, a British government affairs consultant, was among the first to savour the new freedom to exercise - out for a run at 6 a.m. near the city’s Retiro Park.While the park remained closed, hundreds of people were running on the pavement around it.“I have been looking forward to this for weeks. I was joking with my friends that I would be the first out in Madrid. I am very happy to be out after six weeks of yoga videos,” she said.As the rate of infection has fallen and hospitals have regained their footing, the government has shifted its focus towards reopening the country and reviving the economy.Last weekend, children under 14 were allowed out for an hour a day of supervised activity.On Tuesday Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced a four-phase plan to return the country to what he termed “the new normality” by the end of June.To avoid overcrowding as people get outside, the government has implemented a shift system, allocating different time slots to different age groups. Businesses that operate by appointment, such as hairdressers, will be allowed to open from Monday. Bars and restaurants will remain closed for at least another week.Spain has recorded a death toll of 24,824 from the illness, and more than 215,000 cases. The lockdown has hammered the economy and the government expects gross domestic product (GDP) to contract 9.2% in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/free-at-last-spaniards-get-outside-to-exercise-after-49-days-of-lockdown/story-cqlK5ei3LOB9BTz3UzIQNM.html

It also criticized the timing of the US comments as the world tries to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.The US mission said barring Taiwan from the UN was an affront to the international body’s founding principles promoting human freedom and providing a forum welcoming diverse views.US President Donald Trump is escalating efforts to blame China for the Covid-19 pandemic and is exploring ways to hold Beijing accountable. He and his aides have sharpened their criticism of China, hinting at possible retaliation through tariffs. On Monday, a top US health official spoke with his Taiwan counterpart on giving the island a bigger role in the virus fight.“The Chinese Mission hereby expresses strong indignation and firm opposition,” it said in the statement. “The government of the People’s Republic China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-opposes-taiwan-participation-in-un-after-us-tweet/story-Eg4xWd6OUm0NNPBLtRbOLK.html
02-05-2020||World||Kim Jong Un reminds world of nuclear threat at fertilizer plant||The place North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited may be just as significant as showing his face in public after a three-week absence that raised questions about his health and control of the nuclear-armed state.State media on Saturday said Kim celebrated the completion of the Sunchon Phosphatic Fertilizer Factory north of Pyongyang, the capital. Although the inspection tour itself appeared routine, the facility has been the subject of high-level attention for years due to its dual-use potential: North Korea could possibly tap it to increase production of both food and nuclear weapons.“The DPRK does need fertilizer, and the information on how to extract uranium in the midst of that process is readily available,” Margaret Croy, a research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, said in a research paper published last month.It said the fertilizer plant offers Kim the opportunity to help boost the state’s flagging economy by helping agricultural production and can aid in uranium extraction from phosphoric acid, allowing North Korea to conceal its nuclear activities from the outside world.“The implication of such work being conducted in the DPRK is clear: it has the potential to considerably alter open-source estimates of how much yellowcake uranium the DPRK is able to produce annually, which in turn affects estimates of how many nuclear warheads the DPRK can make,” Croy wrote.Under Kim’s leadership, North Korea has made a sharp inward turn to develop its nuclear and missile programs, relying as much as it can on domestic technology and material to advance its weapons under tightened global sanctions designed to prevent it from acquiring the key components needed to realize its atomic ambitions.Kim visited the plant in January, and satellite imagery shows that it has grown considerably since a groundbreaking ceremony in 2017. Two of Kim’s top officials visited it several times over the past three years as construction proceeded, according to state media reports.Croy’s paper didn’t offer proof that the plant was a part of North Korea’s nuclear program, and some other analysts were skeptical.“Theoretically, the fertilizer factory can be used to produce yellowcake, but why would the North do that when it already can produce something more advanced than that?” said Cho Han-bum, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification.North Korea has ample deposits of uranium, and informed the International Atomic Energy Agency in 1992 that it has two mines and two processing plants, which have been closely watched since then. It later informed the IAEA that it has one plant to enrich uranium for weapons, but outside experts believe it has several more.Soviet, Chinese HelpThe Kim family for decades had relied on the outside world to get it started on nuclear materials and missiles to deliver them, seeking help from its former sponsor the Soviet Union and its current biggest benefactor China. It used to import weapons from abroad and develop them into their own systems.But over the years, global sanctions have made it more difficult to rely on others and spy satellites have been keeping a closer eye on its weapons program.The nuclear program has largely been self-sufficient for decades. It used to turn out enough plutonium for one nuclear bomb a year, and now relies mainly on uranium enrichment. According to weapons experts, North Korea produces enough fissile material for about six bombs a year.‘Greatly Pleased’“Pyongyang needs to have most of the supply chain for the production of nuclear warheads and missiles indigenized -- and by all accounts it appears to have largely done so,” said Ankit Panda, a weapons expert who is an adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists.He added there are still some components thought to be sourced from overseas, though North Korea has shown it “has the industrial capacity to build missile airframes, solid and liquid propellants, and even missile engines.”Under Kim, weapons experts said North Korea developed a hydrogen bomb and an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of delivering a warhead to all of the U.S., its main adversary. He has made his nuclear and rocket scientists national heroes, and -- after tests in 2017 -- rewarded many of them with luxury apartments in Pyongyang.During his visit to the fertilizer factory on May 1, Kim said the project demonstrated the country’s commitment to “self-reliance,” according to the official Korean Central News Agency. He added that his father and grandfather would be “greatly pleased.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-reminds-world-of-nuclear-threat-at-fertilizer-plant/story-wwlfhzxwetsy3kYzj6Q3VJ.html

02-05-2020||World||Face mask, white stick: Do Kim Jong Un’s photos hold clues of his 20-day absence?||Kim Jong Un’s first public appearance in almost three weeks sent analysts poring over the few photos released by North Korean media for clues about his mysterious absence.Propaganda reports Saturday about Kim’s visit to a fertilizer factory northeast of Pyongyang didn’t make the slightest allusion to the global speculation about his health in recent weeks. That left observers to glean what they could from visual cues about the supreme leader’s appearance, entourage and surroundings.Here are some things they noticed:1. Kim’s AppearanceKim, 36, who has gained considerable weight since taking power in 2011, didn’t show any obvious sign of the sort of weight-loss that might follow a serious health scare. He was wearing a Mao suit and sporting what looked like a fresh hair cut.Speculation about Kim’s whereabouts had mounted since his unprecedented absence from annual events to celebrate the April 15 birthday of his grandfather, state founder Kim Il Sung. U.S. officials said they were told Kim was in critical condition after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure. He was last seen in state media on April 12.Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, quipped on Twitter: “Well, I wouldn’t say Kim looks healthy, but he definitely doesn’t look dead.” One user with the handle @MaryMaryQ3 agreed, replying “Ashy and bloated.”2. His EntourageKim’s younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, was among those standing closest to the leader in several photographs from the Sunchon Phosphatic Fertilizer Factory visit. Such proximity is often used by North Korean propaganda organs to indicate the leader’s favor and might show that the worldwide discussion about her taking his place hadn’t damaged her standing.Kim Yo Jong, 30, also appeared to be wearing a makeup and a hair band -- both new additions according to Jeongmin Kim, a correspondent with the Seoul-based NK News website. The change in appearance could suggest she was aware of her new, higher profile.3. Face MaskAt least one member of Kim’s entourage could be seen wearing a face mask, keeping alive speculation that Covid-19 is still concern in North Korea. The Seoul-based JoongAng Daily newspaper reported last week that the North Korean leader had been in self-quarantine after one of his bodyguards was confirmed with the coronavirus infection.North Korea closed its borders shortly after China acknowledged the risk of human-to-human transmission in January and cases surged. Kim’s regime has said it has no confirmed infections from the virus.4. Golf CartA green golf cart pictured behind Kim also caught analysts’ attention. It’s similar to one seen when Kim returned from an almost six-week absence in October 2014, walking with a cane and facing speculation that he was battling gout.On the other hand, the factory site looks extensive and anyone might need a cart to get around. Kim used a similar vehicle to give Chinese President Xi Jinping a tour during his visit last year to Pyongyang.5. White StickThe same photo shows one official holding a slender white stick, initially thought by some to be a cane. It was seen in another picture being used as a pointer in a presentation about the plant.The development of the factory itself has been closely watched in open-source satellite analysis for years. The plant is suspected of having a dual-use capability that would help North Korea produce yellow cake uranium for its weapons.North Korea has a history of altering photos and obscuring key details related to its military, knowing that specialists will use sophisticated software and visual clues to locate events and parse details about the performance of its latest weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/face-mask-white-stick-do-kim-jong-un-s-photos-hold-clues-to-his-20-day-absence/story-8PiQmagfd91FQWIqsO0RFL.html
02-05-2020||World||Why North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s health matters||Nearly three weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s no-show at a key event sparked rumours he was seriously ill or even dead, state media published photos Saturday showing him in public.Kim’s conspicuous absence from the April 15 celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather, the North’s founder, sparked feverish speculation over his health and who would replace him at the helm of the nuclear-armed country.It is not the first time Kim has disappeared from public view. In 2014, he dropped out of sight for nearly six weeks before reappearing with a cane. Days later, South Korea’s spy agency said he had undergone surgery to remove a cyst from his ankle.Here is a look at why Kim’s health has been the subject of so much conjecture.Who is his successor? Kim has been in power for nearly a decade and his death would have left Pyongyang facing an unplanned succession for the first time in its history.Leadership has always been a family affair in the isolated North, dominated by the members of the “Paektu bloodline” -- a Northern term for the country’s founder Kim Il Sung and his descendants.Kim’s three known children are still very young and there is no designated successor as far as the world is aware.His younger sister Yo Jong -- one of his closest advisers -- is widely regarded as the top contender to succeed him but the North is a highly patriarchal society where seniority and gender both carry weight.What happens to nuclear talks?Kim is known in the North as the Supreme Leader and his authority spans the ruling Workers’ Party and the military. All major decisions require his approval. Kim’s disappearance from public view came as Pyongyang’s talks with Washington over the North’s nuclear arsenal are at a standstill, despite three meetings between Kim and US President Donald Trump. If Kim were incapacitated or dead, it would have increased uncertainty over the process.The worst scenarios, according to some analysts, would involve power struggles and refugee flows to China.Kim is also obese and both his father and grandfather are believed to have died of heart diseases.“Kim’s personal profile, family history, and the structure of the North Korean regime make his health a major variable for the country’s stability and foreign policy,” Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, told AFP.Why so many rumours? North Korea is an unusually opaque country, where even economic growth figures are treated as a state secret. Observers and even diplomats in Pyongyang rely heavily on the closely controlled state media for hints of what is going on. Secrecy is strictest of all around the leadership and the absence of information creates ample room for speculation to flourish unchecked.Kim was last seen presiding over a ruling party meeting on April 11. But four days later he missed the celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather -- the most important date in the North’s political calendar -- sparking questions over his whereabouts.Daily NK, a South Korea-based outlet run mostly by North Korean defectors, reported Kim had undergone a cardiovascular procedure and was recovering at a villa in North Pyongan province.Soon afterwards CNN reported that Washington was “monitoring intelligence” that Kim was in “grave danger” after undergoing surgery, quoting an anonymous US official. A Japanese report even said he was in a “vegetative state”.But a top security adviser to South Korea’s president later told the US broadcaster Kim was “alive and well”. Trump also downplayed reports of Kim’s poor health and possible demise.“This incident is a reminder of how vulnerable we remain to groundless rumours about North Korea,” former US government North Korea analyst Rachel Lee told AFP.“We need more experts who can analyse North Korea using solid tradecraft.”Analysts say Kim is likely to make another public appearance in the coming days that will be reported by state media. But an official explanation for his absence is unlikely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-north-korean-leader-kim-jong-un-s-health-matters/story-QZ6kcx6hDcqVWdYymyPYFK.html
02-05-2020||World||Canada’s economy is in recession due to Covid-19 impact: Report||A leading Canadian think tank has projected that the country’s economy is now in recession thanks to the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.The Toronto-based C D Howe Institute’s Business Cycle Council made this official even as it stated that the first quarter of 2020 was historic in the sense that the country recorded its highest ever drop in GDP, at a 2.6 per cent fall. Statistics Canada has estimated that Canada’s GDP took a nine per cent hit in March alone, as the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis rattled the economy with several sectors being shut down. March also saw a 5.3 per cent drop in employment in the nation.Click here for Covid-19 coverageThe Council’s decision to declare a recession was based on preliminary data available on April 30 and it stated that while revisions to GDP figures will occur, they are “extremely unlikely to be significant enough to alter the recession call.”This sobering announcement came as the country recorded over 55,000 Covid-19 cases with 3,391 deaths.Already, nearly seven million Canadians, approximately a fifth of the country’s population, have availed of an emergency fund established by the Government to counter the adverse economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. A note published by the Parliamentary Budget Office estimated that total could increase by 20 per cent, to about 8.5 million using the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which was announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and is scheduled to last four months, beginning with March.Click here for Covid-19 updatesWith a subsidy programme also being introduced to support businesses in retaining employees, the budget deficit will go over CA$ 252 billion. Decisions on how the Government will deal with the looming economic crisis have yet to be made, and Trudeau made it clear that facing the current challenges caused by Covid-19 will remain the priority for the short-term. Right now, he said during a media briefing after a session of Parliament, the “focus is on getting through this together as a country.”“There will be time after this is all done as we figure out how exactly this unfolds, where we will have to make next decisions on how that recovery looks,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-economy-is-in-recession-due-to-covid-19-impact-report/story-MVTDtLRvjy7RLUPlwkqKOO.html

The death toll remained at 4,633 with no new fatality. As of Friday, the total confirmed cases on the mainland were 82,875. As many as 77,685 patients have been recovered, the NHC said. One new imported coronavirus case was reported on Friday with no new local infection, it said.China has reported a total of 1,671 imported COVID-19 cases, including seven in critical condition. The Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, have not reported any coronavirus case for 28 consecutive days since April 4, local health commission said on Saturday. Hubei also lowered its COVID-19 emergency response from the highest level to the second-highest on Saturday. The lowering of the emergency level shows a major breakthrough in Hubei’s prevention and control against the coronavirus, Hubei Vice-Governor Yang Yunyan told media.Meanwhile, 20 new asymptomatic cases were reported on Friday, taking the total number of such patients to 989.  Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested COVID-19 positive but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. However, they pose a risk of spreading the disease to others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-covid-19-cases-drop-to-one-no-cases-reported-in-epicentre-hubei-for-almost-a-month/story-EPsU7JjFWjYXTXy8B2JFaM.html

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on Friday said the 60-day grace period for responding to its requests will include requests for evidence; continuations to request evidence (N-14); notices of intent to deny; notices of intent to revoke; notices of intent to rescind and notices of intent to terminate regional investment centers; and filing date requirements for Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion. “USCIS will consider a response to the above requests and notices received within 60 calendar days after the response due date set in the request or notice before taking action,” it said. According to the statement, the USCIS will consider a Form I-290B received up to 60 calendar days from the date of the decision before it takes any action. “USCIS is adopting several measures to protect our workforce and community and to minimise the immigration consequences for those seeking immigration benefits during this time,” it said. The relaxations come in view of the coronavirus outbreak, which first surfaced in China’s Wuhan city in December last.

The American India Foundation (AIF) said it has tied up with the World Central Kitchen (WCK) for organising the meals. “As the impact of Covid-19 continues to evolve, frontline healthcare workers in both the US and in India are serving an important role in the fight against the pandemic, requiring our support now more than ever,” said AIF CEO Nishant Pandey. This collaboration is the latest as part of the AIF’s Covid-19 Response through which it is serving more than 1,00,000 vulnerable people -- including migrant workers in India -- from the economic and social fallout. “AIF is happy to be teaming up with WCK to provide daily meals to hospitals, and long-term care facilities throughout New York City, Bay Area, Boston and Chicago. Through this initiative, we want to show our gratitude towards the frontline health workers in the US,” he said. This partnership will also help the local economy and jobs by supporting local kitchens and restaurants, Pandey said. World Central Kitchen, an international not-for-profit organisation founded by chef José Andrés, provides food to communities in times of crisis. “To provide meals for the tireless and brave medical professionals working on the front lines of this crisis, as well as to meal centers who need assistance more than ever, is truly an honour,” said Nate Mook, CEO of World Central Kitchen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-ngo-to-provide-20-000-meals-to-frontline-health-workers-in-nyc/story-wxaU7IaT9VmUDrXFSNlHEK.html

02-05-2020||World||Tariff on China for mishandling coronavirus outbreak ‘certainly an option’, says Trump||US President Donald Trump on Friday reiterated that imposing an additional tariff on China for allegedly mishandling the coronavirus outbreak is “certainly an option”.Trump was responding to a question about his remarks a day earlier in which he had indicated at imposing tariff on China as a punishment for the spread of coronavirus.“It’s certainly an option. It’s certainly an option,” Trump said but did not give a timeline for this.“We’re going to see what happens. A lot of things are happening with respect to China. We’re not happy, obviously, with what happened. This is a bad situation all over the world, 182 countries. But we’ll be having a lot to say about that,” he said in response to a question.In an interview to Buck Sexton of The Buck Sexton Show, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of being non transparent on the issue of coronavirus.“They’ve claimed that they have been transparent, but of course, at least as of a day or two ago, we still didn’t actually have a sample of the virus. We were still working to try to understand what the scope of the risk was,” he said.Pompeo said China claimed it didn’t know where the coronavirus came from, but those inside China, who tried to talk about the virus, were denied access.They were told “don’t talk about that, stop it” and discussions were banned early on, he added.“That’s not the way partners work, reliable partners work. Reliable partners share. They open up, especially when there’s trouble. They go overboard to make sure everybody can understand how it came to be. That’s all we’ve asked for,” the secretary of state said.“We hope that the Chinese Communist Party will see their way clear to allow the world to understand how the heck this virus got out of Wuhan, China, and spread all across the world,” he said.“We need responsibility and accountability for this outbreak,” Pompeo said.He said it was really important to understand what happened in China during the virus outbreak to make sure something like this does not happen again.“There are multiple labs inside of China and our understanding of what takes place there is pretty limited, and there have been examples of leaks from those labs before,” Pompeo said. He said the coronavirus pandemic has been an expensive and costly calamity and the US needs to do its part but there is a responsibility on Chinese Communist Party to make sure something like this does not happen again. “We have seen the narrative which is that this virus began and the Chinese Communist Party knew about it, didn’t alert the world to it in a timely fashion,” Pompeo said.He further said the whole world world has a right to know what happened in China during the coronavirus outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tariff-on-china-for-mishandling-coronavirus-outbreak-certainly-an-option-says-trump/story-gZ7jf8dnULuIVmojUfcH5K.html
02-05-2020||World||White House blocks Anthony Fauci from testifying to Congress on coronavirus response||Top U.S. health official Anthony Fauci will not testify next week to a congressional committee examining the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, the White House said on Friday, calling it “counterproductive” to have individuals involved in the response testify.The White House issued an emailed statement after a spokesman for the House of Representatives committee holding the hearing said the panel had been informed by Trump administration officials that Fauci had been blocked from testifying.“While the Trump administration continues its whole-of-government response to COVID-19, including safely opening up America again and expediting vaccine development, it is counter-productive to have the very individuals involved in those efforts appearing at congressional hearings,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. “We are committed to working with Congress to offer testimony at the appropriate time.”Fauci’s testimony was being sought for a May 6 hearing by a House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees health programs, said spokesman Evan Hollander. The Washington Post first reported that Fauci would not testify.Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been one of the leading medical experts helping to guide the U.S. response to the highly contagious virus that has swept across the United States.Trump has repeatedly clashed with the Democratic-controlled House over its moves to investigate his actions or those of his administration.In recent days, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer have urged wide-ranging investigations into Trump’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed tens of thousands of Americans.Democrats have criticized Trump, saying he has failed to develop a comprehensive and effective plan for testing Americans for the coronavirus and tracing contacts of those who are infected by the virus that causes the sometimes fatal COVID-19 respiratory disease.Fauci, 79, has had a respectful but sometimes complicated relationship with Trump.The well-regarded doctor has at times corrected or contradicted the president at White House briefings or in press interviews on issues such as the time required to develop a vaccine and the likelihood that the coronavirus will return in the fall.Trump has occasionally shown exasperation with Fauci but ultimately has followed, largely, the advice that he and Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus task force coordinator, have provided on responding to the pandemic.Last month, the White House said Trump was not firing Fauci despite his retweet of a supporter’s #FireFauci message.At the time, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said: “Dr. Fauci has been and remains a trusted adviser to President Trump.”Aides to Fauci were not immediately available to comment on the House committee’s desire to have him testify.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-blocks-anthony-fauci-from-testifying-to-congress-on-coronavirus-response/story-6ilngFO7HRmugOTmik5hyI.html
02-05-2020||World||US government missed some chances to slow coronavirus spread: Health official||The U.S. government was slow to understand how much coronavirus was spreading from Europe, which helped drive the acceleration of outbreaks across the nation, a top health official said Friday.Limited testing and delayed travel alerts for areas outside China contributed to the jump in U.S. cases starting in late February, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the No. 2 official at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“We clearly didn’t recognize the full importations that were happening,” Schuchat told The Associated Press.The coronavirus was first reported late last year in China, the initial epicenter of the global pandemic. But the U.S. has since become the hardest-hit nation, with about a third of the world’s reported cases and more than a quarter of the deaths.The CDC on Friday published an article, authored by Schuchat, that looked back on the U.S. response, recapping some of the major decisions and events of the last few months. It suggests the nation’s top public health agency missed opportunities to slow the spread. Some public health experts saw it as important assessment by one of the nation’s most respected public health doctors.The CDC is responsible for the recognition, tracking and prevention of just such a disease. But the agency has had a low profile during this pandemic, with White House officials controlling communications and leading most press briefings.“The degree to which CDC’s public presence has been so diminished ... is one of the most striking and frankly puzzling aspects of the federal government’s response,” said Jason Schwartz, assistant professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health.President Donald Trump has repeatedly celebrated a federal decision, announced on Jan. 31, to stop entry into the U.S. of any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the previous 14 days. That took effect Feb. 2. China had imposed its own travel restrictions earlier, and travel out of its outbreak areas did indeed drop dramatically.But in her article, Schuchat noted that nearly 2 million travelers arrived in the U.S. from Italy and other European countries during February. The U.S. government didn’t block travel from there until March 11.“The extensive travel from Europe, once Europe was having outbreaks, really accelerated our importations and the rapid spread,” she told the AP. ”I think the timing of our travel alerts should have been earlier.”She also noted in the article that more than 100 people who had been on nine separate Nile River cruises during February and early March had come to the U.S. and tested positive for the virus, nearly doubling the number of known U.S. cases at that time.The article is carefully worded, but Schwartz saw it as a notable departure from the White House narrative.“This report seems to challenge the idea that the China travel ban in late January was instrumental in changing the trajectory of this pandemic in the United States,” he said.In the article, Schuchat also noted the explosive effect of some late February mass gatherings, including a scientific meeting in Boston, the Mardis Gras celebration in New Orleans and a funeral in Albany, Georgia. The gatherings spawned many cases, and led to decisions in mid-March to restrict crowds.Asked about that during the interview, Schuchat said: “I think in retrospect, taking action earlier could have delayed further amplification (of the U.S. outbreak), or delayed the speed of it.”But she also noted there was an evolving public understanding of just how bad things were, as well as a change in what kind of measures — including stay-at-home orders — people were willing to accept.“I think that people’s willingness to accept the mitigation is unfortunately greater once they see the harm the virus can do,” she said. “There will be debates about should we have started much sooner, or did we go too far too fast.”Schuchat’s article still leaves a lot of questions unanswered, said Dr. Howard Markel, a public health historian at the University of Michigan.It doesn’t reveal what kind of proposals were made, and perhaps ignored, during the critical period before U.S. cases began to take off in late February, he said.“I want to know ... the conversations, the memos the presidential edicts,” said Markel, who’s written history books on past pandemics. “Because I still believe this did not need to be as bad as it turned out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-government-missed-some-chances-to-slow-coronavirus-spread-health-official/story-gTgFAdT0FAlHogo5ZjyfuK.html
02-05-2020||World||‘Like I just got out of jail!’: Over a dozen US states ease Covid-19 lockdowns||More than a dozen US states let restaurants, stores or other businesses reopen Friday in the biggest one-day push yet to get their economies up and running again, acting at their own speed and with their own quirks and restrictions to make sure the coronavirus doesn’t come storming back.People in Louisiana could eat at restaurants again but had to sit outside at tables 10 feet (3 meters) apart with no waiter service. Maine residents could attend church services as long as they stayed in their cars. And a Nebraska mall reopened with plexiglass barriers and hand-sanitizing stations but few shoppers.“I feel like I just got out of jail!” accountant Joy Palermo exclaimed as she sat down with a bacon-garnished bloody Mary at the Gretna Depot Cafe outside New Orleans.Meanwhile, the first drug shown to help fight COVID-19 won emergency approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In a major study, remdesivir shortened patients’ recovery time from 15 days to 11 on average and may have also reduced deaths.The virus has killed more than 230,000 people worldwide, including over 64,000 in the U.S. and more than 20,000 each in Italy, Britain, France and Spain, forcing lockdowns that have shuttered factories and businesses, thrown tens of millions out of work and throttled the world’s economies.President Donald Trump said Friday that he’s hoping the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the United States will be below 100,000, which he acknowledged is a “horrible number.” Trump’s predictions of the expected U.S. death toll have changed over time, with his earlier 60,000 projection now being eclipsed. But he said at a White House event that “maybe millions of lives” have been saved by shutting down the economy.With the crisis stabilizing in Europe and in many places in the U.S., countries and states are gradually easing their restrictions amid warnings from health experts that a second wave of infections could hit unless testing for the virus is expanded dramatically.In much of Colorado, people could get their hair cut and shop at stores again, though stay-at-home orders remained in place in Denver and surrounding counties. Wyoming let barbershops, nail salons, gyms and daycare centers reopen. In Maine, golf courses, hairdressers and dentists opened.Hotels near South Carolina beaches opened and state parks unlocked their gates for the first time in more than a month. But in Myrtle Beach, the state’s most popular tourist destination, hotel elevators will be restricted to one person or one family — a potential inconvenience at the area’s 15- and 20-story resorts.Texas’ reopening got underway with sparse crowds at shopping malls and restaurants allowing customers to dine in, though only at 25% capacity in most places. A video posted on social media showed a city park ranger in Austin getting shoved into the water Thursday while asking people in a crowd to keep 6 feet (2 meters) apart from each other. Police charged a 25-year-old man with attempted assault.At Gattuso’s Restaurant in Gretna, Louisiana, Kent and Doris Alimia and their daughters, Molly and Emily, celebrated Molly Alimia’s 22nd birthday at one of the outdoor tables, which were screened by plants in wooden planters 5 feet high.“It’s a nice change of scenery to actually get out of the house,” Molly Alimia said.Outside Omaha, Nebraska, Jasmine Ramos was among a half-dozen shoppers wandering the open-air Nebraska Crossing mall. Most wore masks.“I do think it’s a little soon, but it’s kind of slow and there aren’t a lot of people here, so I’m not too worried,” Ramos said.Restrictions were still in place in Arizona, but warnings from police and health officials didn’t stop Debbie Thompson from serving food Friday inside her Horseshoe Cafe in Wickenburg, a town of 6,300 people about 65 miles (105 kilometers) west of Phoenix. Cheered on by a few customers, Thompson was not arrested, but she later received a call from the state Department of Health Services telling her to stop violating Gov. Doug Ducey’s stay-at-home order.Around the country, protesters have demanded governors reboot the battered economy. More than 100 people chanted and carried signs in front of Chicago’s Thompson Center, where Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has an office, to call for an end to the statewide lockdown.Pritzker has said he will not lift his order until it’s safe, and several counterprotesters expressed support for his position. Nurse anesthetist Benjamin Salazar held up a sign that read, “Stay home. We are getting tired of seeing people die.”New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham invoked the state’s Riot Control Act as she sealed off all roads to nonessential traffic in the city of Gallup, population 70,000, to help control a surging coronavirus outbreak in the former trading post on the outskirts of the Navajo reservation.“In the hardest-hit corner of the U.S., New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said schools and colleges will remain closed through the rest of the academic year.In Washington state, where the nation’s first COVID-19 case was confirmed in January, Gov. Jay Inslee said Friday that he is extending the state’s coronavirus stay-at-home order through at least May 31 and that he will ease the restrictions in four stages. Washington also had the first deadly cluster of cases in the U.S., at a Seattle-area nursing home.Elsewhere around the world, Beijing’s Forbidden City, the imperial palace turned museum that is one of China’s biggest tourist attractions, started welcoming visitors again, and Bangladesh began reopening factories.Across Europe and Asia, millions of workers marked May Day, or international labor day, struggling without jobs or worried they don’t have enough workplace protections against the virus.In the U.S., Shani and Sergei Oveson were excited to resume dine-in seating at their small Salt Lake City restaurant, which has seen an 85% drop in sales since mid-March. Their place, the Ramen Bar, had only half the normal seating capacity because of social-distancing requirements.“We’re really excited to be open, but at the same time we’re scared that the virus will reignite and we’ll have to close again, which would be so hard for us,” Shani Oveson said. “Owning your own business can be so scary financially, we have to risk getting sick to survive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/like-i-just-got-out-of-jail-over-a-dozen-us-states-ease-covid-19-lockdowns/story-4xvk0CchKa4kPJg1VjrVRL.html
02-05-2020||World||China ‘mishandled situation’ after coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan: White House||The White House on Friday said China “mishandled the situation” after the coronavirus outbreak in its Wuhan city, but refrained from giving a definitive answer on retaliatory measures against the Asian giant.The deadly coronavirus that was first reported in China’s Wuhan city in mid-November has so far killed more than 2,35,000 people globally, including 64,000 Americans, and has infected 3.3 million across the world.Led by the United States, several countries, including Germany, Britain and Australian, are blaming China for the spread of coronavirus across the globe.On Thursday, President Donald Trump had hinted at using tariff as a tool to punish China for mishandling the virus outbreak and the next day the markets went down.“The markets are down substantially today after the President yesterday suggested in the East Room that he might use tariffs to punish China over the coronavirus. Is there any serious consideration being given to putting new tariffs on China or was the President just spitballing yesterday?” the new White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany was asked during her maiden press conference. “I won’t get ahead of any announcements from the President, but I will echo the President’s displeasure with China. It’s no secret that China mishandled this situation,” McEnany told reporters.“Just a few examples for you; they did not share the genetic sequence until a professor in Shanghai did so on his own. The very next day China shut down his lab for quote rectification. They slow-walked information on human to human transmission alongside the World Health Organization and didn’t let US investigators in at a very important time,” she said.“So, we take displeasure with China’s actions, but I certainly won’t get out of the president with those announcements. Again, when it comes to retaliatory measures, I will not get ahead of the president on that,” McEnany asserted.The White House Press Secretary said the US continues to have very limited and dubious data from China and the current assessments indicated that Trump’s statement, that coronavirus came from a lab in Wuhan, is consistent with what some analysts believe is the epicenter of where the virus began.On Thursday, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) had said in a statement that the Intelligence Community concurs with the wide scientific consensus that “the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified”. Responding to a question on the ODNI’s statement, McEnany said “Let me remind everyone intelligence is just an estimate essentially, and it’s up to policymakers to decide what to do with that intelligence. In this case, the policymaker is the President of the United States and he will make a decision at the right time.” She alleged that there’s no secret that China stopped US investigators from coming in.“It was of paramount importance that we got into China in an expedited fashion, and that didn’t happen. With respect to the World Health Organization, they have some questions of their own to answer,” the press secretary said.She said the United States, as the president has emphasized, provides about USD 400 million to USD 500 million per year to the WHO compared to China at roughly USD 40 million a year, but yet “WHO appears to have a very clear China bias”.“I mean, look at this timeline and it’s really damning for the WHO when you just consider the fact that on December 31, you had Taiwanese officials warning about human to human transmission and the WHO did not make that public. On January 9 the WHO repeated China’s claim that the virus ‘does not transmit readily between people’. That was quite apparently false,” McEnany said.“On January 14, the WHO again repeated China’s talking points about no human to human transmission. They praised China’s leadership on 22 January. On the 23rd, they said, and this is incredible, the pandemic didn’t represent a public health emergency of international concern,” she said.“And even on February 29, you had the WHO saying that when the coronavirus was spreading around the world, they chose to put, excuse me, political correctness first by opposing lifesaving travel restrictions.” “The travel restrictions this president put in place, the travel restrictions that Dr. Fauci praised as saving lives and you have the World Health Organization opposing a measure that saved American lives. That’s unacceptable, especially at a time when the US was providing USD 400 to 500 million,” the White House Press Secretary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-mishandled-situation-after-coronavirus-outbreak-in-wuhan-white-house/story-EB0mbPe2wTCACfbyuYLtLM.html
02-05-2020||World||NASA, SpaceX to launch astronauts into space on May 27 despite Covid-19 pandemic||NASA and SpaceX said Friday they were pressing ahead with plans to launch astronauts to space from US soil for the first time in a decade later this month, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, both veterans of the Space Shuttle program that was shuttered in 2011, will blast off from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida on May 27.NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine told reporters that the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule will be only the fifth class of US spacecraft to take human beings into orbit, after the storied Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and Space Shuttle programs.“If you look globally, this will be the ninth time in history when we put humans on a brand new spacecraft,” said Bridenstine.“We’re going to do it here in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. I’m going to tell you this is a high priority mission for the United States of America,” he added.But, he said, NASA was asking that people avoid traveling to the space center to witness the spectacle.“That makes me sad to even say it -- boy, I wish we could make this into something really spectacular,” he said.Behnken and Hurley, who have been training for the “Demo-2” mission for years, will dock with the International Space Station (ISS) and then remain there for between one to four months, depending on when the next mission takes place, said NASA’s Steve Stich.Crew Dragon is able to remain in orbit for around four months (119 days). Win for SpaceX The mission is a major milestone for SpaceX, the company founded by billionaire Elon Musk, who also leads and founded Tesla.His firm, which was founded in 2002, has now overtaken aerospace behemoth Boeing, which failed in the uncrewed demonstration mission of its Starliner spacecraft last year and will have to start over.SpaceX, which has received billions of dollars from NASA since the late 2000s, has been supplying cargo to the ISS since 2012, and has established itself as the leader in the private space sector thanks to its reusable rocket, the Falcon 9.“I’ll feel a little relief when they’re in orbit, I’ll feel more relief when they get to the station and then obviously, I will start sleeping again when they’re back safely on the planet Earth,” Gwynne Shotwell, the company’s chief operating officer said.The pandemic has, naturally, impacted the program, but Shotwell said that all precautions were being taken to protect the astronauts.“We are ensuring that only essential personnel are near them. They’re wearing masks and gloves. We’re cleaning the training facility twice daily. “I think we’re really doing a great job to ensure that we are not impacting the safety or the health of the astronauts’ lives.”Takeoff is scheduled for 4:42pm on May 27 (2042 GMT), with space station docking scheduled about 19 hours later, on May 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-spacex-to-launch-astronauts-into-space-on-may-27-despite-covid-19-pandemic/story-otLBSLJY5Z3T6W4oHkr5DI.html
02-05-2020||World||Indians at greater risk from Covid-19 in UK’s health sector: Report||Indians make up one in 10 of all foreign-born doctors in the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) and therefore face a greater risk from the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new report published on Friday.The Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) study, in its report analysing the ethnic variables in the impact of coronavirus, also found that Indians are among the ethnic groups less likely to be impacted by the economic consequences of the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the deadly virus due to their employment in more secure sectors.“Indian men are particularly exposed to the virus due to their prevalence in healthcare roles,” said the report titled ‘Are some ethnic groups more vulnerable to Covid-19 than others?’ “Indian men are 150 per cent more likely to work in health or social care roles than their white British counterparts. While the Indian ethnic group makes up 3 per cent of the working-age population of England and Wales, they account for 14 per cent of doctors,” it said.The IFS analysis found that among the UK’s working age population, those working in health and social care may be at the greatest risk of infection, with Indians facing a high risk due to their sheer numbers.While 37 per cent of the UK’s doctors are foreign-born, nearly one in 10 are from India – all currently on the frontline of the coronavirus fightback in hospitals and other care settings.In reference to its analysis of the economic impact of the pandemic on different ethnic groups, the study found that Pakistani and Bangladeshi households were more vulnerable among the South Asian cohort due to a higher proportion of them in sectors which are undergoing shutdown due to the social distancing rules.“Ethnic groups also vary substantially in their economic vulnerability under the restrictions currently in place… Indian ethnic groups face lower economic risks and are more comparable to white British in this regard,” according to the study.“Bangladeshi and Pakistani groups, by contrast, appear to be particularly at risk due to the high percentage of either group working in shutdown sectors and/or in self-employment, combined with the prevalence of single-earner households which reduces the potential for income buffers within the household,” it added.In its other findings, the IFS study concluded that coronavirus patients from black African backgrounds in England and Wales are dying at more than triple the rate of white Britons, followed by Pakistani men as the next highest category.Black and South Asian ethnic groups have been found to have much higher rates of diabetes than the population as a whole, and older Pakistani men have been found to have particularly high levels of cardiovascular disease – all considered higher risk factors.Besides, compared to white British households, minority ethnic groups also tend to be more likely to live in overcrowded accommodation, making social distancing more difficult.The study concludes: “In sum, there is clear evidence for disproportionality in COVID-19 mortalities thus far for a number of ethnic groups after accounting for their age profiles and places of residence.“While it is difficult to say definitively with the data that are currently available, the clustering of some minority groups in key worker occupations – and in health and care key worker roles in particular – alongside greater susceptibility to relevant long-term conditions, are likely to be contributing factors to the observed inequalities.” The analysis focuses on a limited set of risk factors in terms of both infection risk and economic vulnerability in the short term and concludes that more research is required for a better understanding of the disparity in the impact of the pandemic among different ethnicities.The UK government launched an official review, led by Public Health England, earlier this month as it emerged that black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) are affected disproportionately by the deadly virus.

02-05-2020||World||NATO withholds key information on Taliban attacks: US Watchdog||NATO’s US-led mission in Afghanistan is withholding key information about Taliban attacks, a US government watchdog said Friday, potentially making insights into the war harder just as the Pentagon slashes its troop presence.The Resolute Support (RS) mission previously disclosed data on “enemy-initiated attacks”, one of the few remaining public metrics of the conflict and the strength of the Taliban and other insurgent groups.In its quarterly report released Friday, the office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said RS had stopped providing numbers.Instead, RS gave only a short statement noting the Taliban had stepped up attacks in March, immediately after the signing of a US-Taliban deal that was supposed to pave the way to peace talks. “Between March 1 and 31, the Taliban refrained from attacks against coalition forces; however they increased attacks against (Afghan forces) to levels above seasonal norms,” RS said, according to the report.Under the deal, US and other foreign forces will quit Afghanistan next year if the Taliban start peace talks with Kabul and stick to various security commitments.In the week ahead of the February 29 deal signing in Doha, violence plummeted during a partial truce and US officials hoped attacks would stay low.Instead, the Taliban immediately resumed assaults on Afghan forces.During the deal negotiations, the Taliban had agreed to stop hitting foreign troops, but there was no such prohibition on targeting Afghan forces.- ‘Unacceptably high’ violence -RS told SIGAR that it chose to restrict data because enemy attacks were now a “critical part” of discussions “regarding ongoing political negotiations between the US and the Taliban”.SIGAR noted the Pentagon said it might release the information in the future.A Pentagon spokesman justified the decision to withhold data, citing ongoing talks.“So the decision was that we’re working toward a better solution and a better place for Afghanistan and that the sharing of that information would not... move the ball forward,” the spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, told reporters.“The level of violence by the Taliban is unacceptably high,” he said, adding that it was not conducive to a diplomatic solution. The move to withhold attack numbers follows a trend of diminishing insights into America’s longest war, which the US has given up ever winning and is instead trying to end through a political agreement that will provide face-saving cover to leave Afghanistan.In 2018, RS stopped providing data on how much of the country the Taliban held or contested, amid criticism the war was at a stalemate. That followed a decision by the Afghan government to classify data on how many of its soldiers and police were getting killed by the Taliban, after shocking figures showed several thousand were dying each year.Data on enemy attacks “was one of the last remaining metrics SIGAR was able to use to report publicly on the security situation in Afghanistan,” the watchdog said.The Pentagon is on course to cut its troop numbers from about 12,000 to 8,600 in the coming months.In its report, SIGAR also warned that Afghanistan faces a brutal toll in its worsening coronavirus crisis.“Afghanistan’s numerous and, in some cases, unique vulnerabilities... make it likely the country will confront a health disaster in the coming months,” SIGAR said.Afghanistan officials have so far confirmed 2,171 cases of COVID-19, including 64 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-withholds-key-information-on-taliban-attacks-us-watchdog/story-ghiS7GW2VNjOyB0kqrdeYK.html
02-05-2020||World||North Korea’s Kim Jong Un makes first appearance in nearly three weeks: Report||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made his first public appearance since speculation about his health began last month, cutting the ribbon at the opening of a fertilizer factory, KCNA reported Saturday.Kim attended the event on Friday in Sunchon, near the capital Pyongyang, after nearly three weeks of swirling rumours that the leader of the nuclear-armed nation was seriously ill or possibly dead. The North Korean leader had not made a public appearance since presiding over a Workers’ Party politburo meeting on April 11, and the following day state media reported that he had inspected fighter jets.At Friday’s event, “all the participants broke into thunderous cheers of ‘hurrah!’“ when Kim appeared, the Korean Central news agency reported.He inspected the facility and was “briefed about the production processes,” the report said.Kim “said with deep emotion” that his grandfather Kim Il Sung and father Kim Jong Il “would be greatly pleased if they heard the news that the modern phosphatic fertilizer factory has been built,” it added.Also in attendance were other senior officials, including his sister and close adviser, Kim Yo Jong. Photos from the ceremony were not immediately released.Conjecture over Kim’s health had grown since his conspicuous no-show at April 15 celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather, the North’s founder -- the most important day in the country’s political calendar.His absence unleashed a series of unconfirmed reports over his condition, triggering global fears over the North’s nuclear arsenal -- and who would succeed Kim were he unable to lead.A top security advisor to South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in said less than a week ago that Kim was “alive and well,” downplaying rumors that he was ill or incapacitated.The advisor, Moon Chung-in, told CNN that Kim had been staying in Wonsan -- a resort town in the east of North Korea -- since April 13, adding: “No suspicious movements have so far been detected.”- Rumours of ill health -Daily NK, an online media outlet run mostly by North Korean defectors, reported that Kim was undergoing treatment after a cardiovascular procedure last month.Citing an unidentified source inside the country, it said Kim -- who is in his mid-30s -- had needed urgent treatment due to heavy smoking, obesity and fatigue.Soon afterwards, CNN reported that Washington was “monitoring intelligence” that Kim was in “grave danger” after undergoing surgery, quoting an anonymous US official.US President Donald Trump appeared to confirm that Kim was alive earlier this week.On Friday, Trump refused to comment on Kim’s reported re-emergence.Previous absences from the public eye on Kim’s part have prompted speculation about his health.The North is extremely secretive, and doubly so about its leadership. Kim’s father and predecessor had been dead for two days before anyone outside the innermost circles of North Korean leadership was any the wiser.In 2014, Kim Jong Un dropped out of sight for nearly six weeks before reappearing with a cane. Days later, the South’s spy agency said he had undergone surgery to remove a cyst from his ankle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-makes-first-appearance-in-nearly-three-weeks-report/story-Qf3FcYI5et0pbTpBfYPIGP.html
02-05-2020||World||US issues emergency approval for remdesivir for Covid-19 patients||U.S. regulators on Friday allowed emergency use of the first drug that appears to help some COVID-19 patients recover faster, a milestone in the global search for effective therapies against the coronavirus.The Food and Drug Administration said in a statement that Gilead Science’s intravenous drug would be specifically indicated for hospitalized patients with “severe disease,” such as those experiencing breathing problems requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilators.President Donald Trump announced the news at the White House alongside Gilead CEO Daniel O’Day and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn.“This was lightning speed in terms of getting something approved” said Hahn, calling the drug “an important clinical advance.”The FDA acted after preliminary results from a government-sponsored study showed that the drug, remdesivir, shortened the time to recovery by 31%, or about four days on average, for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.The study of 1,063 patients is the largest and most strict test of the drug and included a comparison group that received just usual care so remdesivir’s effects could be rigorously evaluated.Those given the drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average vs. 15 days for the comparison group. The drug may also help avert deaths, but the effect is not yet large enough for scientists to know for sure.Dr. Sameer Khanijo, a critical care specialist, said he wants to see additional studies to clarify the drug’s benefit.“I don’t think this is a cure yet, but I think it’s starting to point us in the right direction,” said Khanijo of North Shore University Hospital in New York. “As a society it’s nice to have something that will help stem the tide of this disease.”The FDA said preliminary results for federal researchers warranted Friday’s decision, though regulators acknowledged “there is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir.”The drug’s side effects include potential inflammation of the liver and problems related to its infusion, which could lead to nausea, vomiting, sweating and low blood pressure. Information about dosing and potential safety issues will be provided to physicians and patients, the FDA said.The National Institutes of Health’s Dr. Anthony Fauci said Wednesday the drug would become a new standard of care for severely ill COVID-19 patients. The drug, which blocks an enzyme the virus uses to copy its genetic material, has not been tested on people with milder illness.The FDA authorized the drug under its emergency powers to quickly speed experimental drugs, tests and other medical products to patients during public health crises.In normal times the FDA requires “substantial evidence” of a drug’s safety and effectiveness, usually through one or more large, rigorously controlled patient studies. But during public health emergencies the agency can waive those standards and require only that an experimental drug’s potential benefits outweigh its risks.Gilead has said it would donate its currently available stock of the drug and is ramping up production to make more. It said the U.S. government would coordinate distribution of remdesivir to places most in need of it.No drugs are approved now for treating the coronavirus, and remdesivir will still need formal approval.The FDA can convert the drug’s status to full approval if Gilead or other researchers provide additional data of remdesivir’s safety and effectiveness.“This is a very, very early stage so you wouldn’t expect to have any sort of full approval at this point,” said Cathy Burgess, an attorney specializing in FDA issues. “But obviously they want to get this out to patients as quickly as possible.”The FDA previously allowed narrow use of a malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, for hospitalized patients who were unable to take part in ongoing studies of the medication. Trump repeatedly promoted it as a possible COVID-19 treatment, but no large high-quality studies have shown the drug works for that and it has significant safety concerns.The FDA warned doctors late last month against prescribing the drug outside of hospital or research settings, due to risks of sometimes fatal heart side effects.Two small studies published Friday add to concerns about the malaria drug. Critically ill COVID-19 patients given hydroxychloroquine were prone to heart rhythm problems, and for many risks mounted when it was combined with an antibiotic, the studies found.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-issues-emergency-approval-for-remdesivir-for-covid-19-patients/story-YJaDzIrS7yVR1xHTEZU6yJ.html
02-05-2020||World||Virus in France has local traces: Report||The coronavirus outbreak in France was not caused by cases imported from China, but from a locally circulating strain of unknown origin, according to a new study reported by local media.The study, published by virologists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, said the French strain may have been circulating locally and unrecognised before the global outbreak accelerated, French public radio network RFI said in a report on its website.“Tests on samples from 97 French and three Algerians infected with Sars-CoV-2 suggest that the virus may have been around in France before the pandemic started,” it said.Genetic analysis of the samples revealed that the dominant types of viral strains in France belonged to a group with a common ancestor that did not come from either China or Italy, it said, citing the 16-page study that was first reported by South China Morning Post newspaper.“The French outbreak has been mainly seeded by one or several variants of this clade (group) … we can infer that the virus was silently circulating in France in February,” the SCMP quoted researchers led by Dr Sylvie van der Werf and Etienne Simon-Loriere as saying. The research was published in a non-peer reviewed paper released on bioRxiv.org.The earliest sample in the French clade was collected on 19 February from a patient who had no travel history and no known contact with returned travellers.However, “current sampling clearly prevents reliable inference for the timing of introduction in France,” making it impossible to conclude that the virus existed in France even before it was discovered in China, the researchers said. France detected the virus in late January, before any other country in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virus-in-france-has-local-traces-report/story-YZ0Un87JH3RRWqyySXbNrM.html
