08-05-2020||World||US, China trade officials press ahead with ‘Phase 1’ deal after overnight call||Top US and Chinese trade representatives played down deep differences over the economic wreckage of the coronavirus pandemic and said they would press ahead with implementing their “Phase 1” trade deal after an overnight phone call.US President Donald Trump, critical of China’s early handling of the coronavirus outbreak in the city of Wuhan in late 2019, told Fox News Channel on Friday that he was “very torn” about whether to end the trade deal.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer discussed the deal with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on the phone call. The US officials said in a joint statement that both sides agreed the obligations would be met.China’s Commerce Ministry said the two sides agreed to improve the atmosphere for implementation of the trade deal, which calls for Beijing to boost its purchases of American farm and manufactured goods, energy and services by $200 billion over two years compared to a 2017 baseline.While China has made some purchases, some observers say these are running far behind the pace needed to meet the first-year goal of a $77 billion increase as China’s economy is just now beginning to recover from shutdowns imposed during the pandemic. On the call, the two sides “agreed that in spite of the current global health emergency, both countries fully expect to meet their obligations under the agreement in a timely manner,” Lighthizer and Mnuchin said in their statement.FEELING DIFFERENTLYTrump and other top officials have blamed China for the deaths of hundreds of thousands from the outbreak and have threatened punitive action, including possible tariffs and shifting supply chains away from China.Trump has said he would terminate the trade deal if China fails to meet its purchase commitments. He said on Wednesday that he would know within a week or two whether that was possible.The US statement suggested that more time may be needed and that the two sides would continue calls on a “regular basis.”Calling into Fox News Channel just before the Labor Department announced that 20.5 million non-farm jobs were lost during April amid coronavirus business closures, Trump said the overnight phone call indicated that the deal “moves along.”But he said that while he was initially “very excited” about the trade deal, the pandemic had changed his views about it.“Look, I feel differently than I did. I was the most - I was very tough with China. They have to buy $250 billion worth of product, et cetera, et cetera,” Trump said.Asked if he was “breaking up” the Phase 1 trade deal, Trump said: “I’m very - I’m very torn as to - I have not decided yet, if you want to know the truth.”The US-China Business Council, which represents US companies doing business in China, said it was too soon to assess China’s compliance with the trade deal, given that it only took effect on Feb. 15 as a global health crisis was unfolding.“It would be extremely destabilizing if the president pulled out of the agreement without giving the Chinese a chance to meet their commitments,” USCBC president Craig Allen said in a statement. “So far, China seems to be operating in good faith and has sought no modifications to its purchase commitments despite its ability to request them.”A clause in the agreement allows for either party to seek consultations in the event a natural disaster or other unforeseen circumstances prevent compliance. The clause has not been invoked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-trade-officials-press-ahead-with-phase-1-deal-after-overnight-call/story-eyVJLAgPiEHH6hhp88tvYL.html

Of them, 18 have already received supplies with more on the way. The costs of each package of equipment -- some 100,000 euros ($108,000) -- are borne by the IAEA.“Some laboratories in some areas of the world don’t have the necessary equipment. They don’t have the necessary reagents and procedures to rapidly detect the virus,” Cattoli said.Those who have received equipment are Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Iran, Kenya, Latvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Malaysia, Montenegro, Morocco, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Peru, Philippines, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Togo.The IAEA Laboratories in Seibersdorf are the only ones of their kind operated by the UN in the world.They cooperate with the FAO and others to monitor the evolution of the novel coronavirus and other viruses.They also work on improvements to RT-PCR technology, which may enable it to be used outside laboratories in the future, Cattoli said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shortages-of-coronavirus-test-materials-critical-un-lab-chief/story-0bWAMdJqgj6bkYtwlUKUSO.html

An unprecedented 20.5 million people were left jobless that month, according to new data released Friday.It’s been the worst since World War II, a grim milestone as the world celebrated VE Day to commemorate the surrender of Nazi forces in Europe on May 8, 1945. The previous record of job losses 10.4%, was all the way back in 1948, more than half a century ago; and it’s the steepest monthly drop since 1939.An estimated 33.5 million people have filed for unemployments benefits in the past six weeks since the lockdowns went into effect mid-March, according to weekly data released Thursday; the peak was 6.9 million in late March.“Today’s report reflects the massive impact that measures to contain the coronavirus have had on the American workforce,” Eugene Scalia, the US labour secretary said in a statement. “This employment situation is exceptionally fluid. We know that today’s data reflect neither the additional layoffs that occurred in late April and early May, nor the employees beginning to return to work in some States. We also know that, by re-opening safely, we have the capacity to avoid permanent job losses for the overwhelming percent of Americans who, the report shows, currently view their job loss as temporary.”President Donald Trump tried to strike a positive note, saying the economy will bounce back. “Those jobs will all be back and they’ll be back very soon,” he said in an interview to Fox News, slipping on his cheerleader hat, as he has often said he does. He added the next year will be “a phenomenal year”.Unemployment numbers stood at 3.5% in February, a half-century low. The economy was booming and the president had hoped to ride it to a second term. He called the collapse “artificial” as he has sought before to make it clear he is not responsible for it.The US has pumped in trillions of dollars into the economy to bail out businesses hit by the lockdown and help them keep as many employees on their rolls as they can. And direct payments have been made to American families below a certain income level and unemployments benefits have been increased substantially to alleviate their situation.And as the number of new infections have have continued to drop and as have those for hospitalization and intubation (patients put on ventilators), most states have either eased restrictions, or have announced plans, and allowed certain businesses and establishments to reopen, under strict observance of social distancing rules.But experts have warned of a resurgence in fatalities because of the easing and one widely cited research model has projected more than 134,000 deaths by August 4.Fatalities went up by 2.231 in the last 24 hours to 75,670 Friday morning and the number of confirmed and reported infections increased by 28,420 to 1.25 million. The number of single-day deaths had dropped considerably but have since rebounded, posting another 2,000-plus toll.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-job-losses-shoot-up-to-record-14-7-in-april/story-6or02LkPeBbV7CHa6CXlDN.html

North Korea cited a military exercise by the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) Air Combat Command on Wednesday, and said the drills violated inter-Korean agreements aimed at reducing military tensions.“Everything is now going back to the starting point before the north-south summit meeting in 2018,” the statement said.On Sunday, South Korea said North Korean troops fired multiple shots toward a South Korean guard post at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which separates the two countries.South Korean troops responded by firing warning shots, but no casualties were reported.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had said the shots fired by North Korea were likely “accidental”.In a separate dispatch, KCNA said Kim sent a verbal message to the Chinese president about the coronavirus, KCNA said.“Kim Jong Un in his message extended his warm greetings to Xi Jinping and congratulated him, highly appreciating that he is seizing a chance of victory in the war against the unprecedented epidemic,” said KCNA.Kim wished Xi good health and the KCNA report said the relations between Pyongyang and Beijing were “firmly consolidated.Asked about Kim’s message to Xi during a daily briefing in Beijing on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China and North Korea are friendly neighbours and in close communication on Covid-19 epidemic control. She said she had nothing to update with in response to a question on whether Xi will send a reply to Kim.Covid-19 is the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. North Korea has said it has no cases of the coronavirus, but previously reinforced border checks and anti-epidemic measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-lashes-out-at-south-korean-military-drills-sends-greetings-to-china/story-m6HraJAOn9iWSwtk0lfe2I.html

Had they been listed properly, the unemployment rate would have been nearly five percentage points higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-destroys-20-5-mn-us-jobs-in-april-in-historic-collapse/story-eYyKtSMVS0N2bhGaZdHsEM.html
08-05-2020||World||China supports WHO-led review of pandemic after it is over, says foreign ministry||China supports a World Health Organisation (WHO)-led review into the coronavirus pandemic after it is declared over, the foreign ministry said on Thursday.The review should be conducted in an “open, transparent and inclusive manner” under the leadership of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying said at the regular ministry briefing on Friday.Hua’s comments come in the backdrop of increasing global pressure to allow an international probe into the origins of the pandemic and the novel coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageChina has dismissed US allegations that the virus came from a laboratory.More than 3.8 million have been sickened in the Covid-19 pandemic and over 268000 have died.The epidemic situation in China has improved dramatically with the government having lowered risk levels for the country on Thursday; daily cases are in low single digits.Hua said the enquiry should be carried out an “appropriate time after the pandemic is over”.It should also be based on the protocols of the International Health Regulations, and be authorised by the World Health Assembly or Executive Committee - the WHO’s dual governing bodies.Countries including the US and Australia have called for an international probe into the origins of the pathogen and others like the UK and Germany have urged greater transparency from China.Until now, China has rejected similar calls for an investigation, accusing the US of “politicising the issue”.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has claimed that the US has evidence that the virus originated from a high-security lab in Wuhan.“We have asked him several times: where is the evidence? Take it out if you have it,” spokesperson Hua said at Friday’s briefing.“We have stated the facts many times, but Pompeo still repeatedly smears and attacks China on the issue. We are forced to expose the US according to public information and media reports,” Hua said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-supports-who-led-review-of-pandemic-after-it-is-over-says-foreign-ministry/story-y4Bw5xtLHggF8adFTBZvoK.html

A German intelligence report cast doubts on their accusation.Some 3.86 million people have been reported to be infected around the world and 268,620 have died, according to Reuters tally.Responding to Australia’s efforts to establish support for an international inquiry, France and Britain have said their focus is fighting the virus, not apportioning blame.Trump has been fiercely critical of China and the World Health Organization and has announced the United States will withdraw funding from the U.N. agency.Many scientists and politicians say now is the time to increase, not cut, funding to the WHO so that it can help find a vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-open-to-probe-of-origins-of-coronavirus-says-envoy-report/story-euVsGFySZalsC0jUpJu3EM.html

A two-minute silence was observed across the UK on Friday morning.As the royal family and the Prime Minister Boris Johnson led tributes while maintaining social distancing due to the coronavirus pandemic, many recalled the contribution of Indians, such as iconic spy Noor Inayat Khan and the erstwhile Women’s Royal Indian Naval Service (WRINS).The ‘Wrins’, as they were known, mostly included Indian women. It was formed in 1942, and went on to become an intrinsic part of the British defence forces. They were assigned specialist tasks, such as top secret decoding, clerical duties, training in gunnery tactics.Johnson said: “Seventy-five years ago today, the people of this country celebrated victory against Hitler’s aggression. This country triumphed thanks to the heroism of countless ordinary people, and because of this, hundreds of millions of people now live in peace and freedom today”.“Today we must celebrate their achievement, and we remember their sacrifice. We are a free people because of everything our veterans did - we offer our gratitude, our heartfelt thanks and our solemn pledge: you will always be remembered.”At 3 pm on Friday, extracts from Churchill’s victory speech were scheduled to be broadcast across television and radio to recreate the moment the end of the war was announced. Queen Elizabeth, who was a witness to the events 75 years ago, was due to address the nation at 9 pm.Over 2 million soldiers from the colonial Indian army joined the World War II, besides financial and other contribution from the colony. The soldiers saw action in various theatres of conflict in Europe as well as in south Asia; 89,000 of them died.---||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-soldiers-remembered-as-uk-marks-victory-in-europe-day/story-SUrubbS9MptS1C6ZBzG1TI.html

That lull ended when official media showed a smiling Kim appearing at a May 1 ribbon-cutting event to open a new fertilizer factory, wearing a Mao suit and being greeted by the cheers of workers.The health of North Korea’s leader is one of the most closely guarded secrets in the country, only known by a few people in the inner circle. While North Korea’s state media almost never speaks on the subject, a prolonged absence can lead to speculation in the outside world.Reuters reported last month, citing people familiar with the matter, that China had sent a medical team to North Korea to advise on Kim. North Korea state media has made no allusions to Kim’s health, but the Seoul-based JoongAng Daily newspaper separately reported that the North Korean leader had been in self-quarantine after one of his bodyguards was confirmed with a coronavirus infection.In a separate North Korean media report Friday, a spokesman for North Korea’s armed forces called a South Korean military drill set for this week “reckless” and a “provocation.” Pyongyang has often used such exercises as a pretense for its own military displays.The comment came after Seoul accused North Korean troops Sunday of firing on South Korean personnel in the demilitarized zone that divides the two countries. South Korea said the action violated a 2018 military agreement between President Moon Jae-in and Kim to suspend hostile actions that could prompt conflict.Beijing has for decades worried about leadership instability in nuclear-armed North Korea that could ignite a humanitarian crisis on its border, or even a collapse of the regime. That would open the door to the emergence of a unified Korea supported by the U.S.No Cases?The stability of impoverished North Korea concerns not only China and its other immediate neighbors, but the world. A power vacuum would raise questions about who controls its estimated stockpile of enough fissile material for as many as 60 nuclear bombs and hundreds of missiles capable of delivering an atomic payload.Despite being between China -- the original epicenter of the virus outbreak -- and South Korea, which briefly was one of the hardest-hit countries, North Korea has said it hasn’t had any confirmed cases of Covid-19. Some including the commander of U.S. Forces Korea have expressed doubts about that claim.China and South Korea have both seen dramatic falls in new infections over the past several weeks and are starting to re-open their economies after massive efforts to contain the virus. North Korea is one of the world’s poorest countries and its antiquated medical system could be overwhelmed by a severe Covid-19 outbreak.North Korea’s KCNA on Friday said that preventive measures are being taken in all regions “against the widespread malignant virus infection that comes to be a world disaster,” adding the country is stockpiling materials for anti-epidemic efforts and working to develop a vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-lauds-china-s-virus-actions-wishes-xi-good-health/story-Gyhmk85s0toex7hu82k4OI.html

The city in the northern Lombardy region is the epicentre of Italy’s outbreak, one of the worst in Europe in terms of deaths and infections.More than 80,000 infections have been recorded in Lombardy -- almost 40 percent of Italy’s overall cases -- according to official data. Only 33,000 of Lombardy’s cases are considered recovered. The region’s capital Milan, is “a bit of a bomb,” said Massimo Galli, the head of the infectious diseases department at the renowned Sacco hospital in Milan.“We have a very high number of infected people returning to circulation,” he said in an interview with the Repubblica newspaper, referring to the easing of lockdown measures on May 4. Photographs of youngsters sitting along Milan’s canals enjoying aperitifs in the sunshine, many without wearing masks or respecting social distances rules, were splashed over the front pages of Italy’s main dailies Friday.Galli said it was clear the easing of the lockdown “may present problems”.Milan’s Mayor Giuseppe Sala slammed the canal-side behaviour as “shameful” and threatened to close the well-known aperitif area if people persist in flouting the rules.Lombardy has logged some 15,000 deaths, around half of Italy’s 30,000 coronavirus fatalities, since the outbreak first erupted in early March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-s-milan-a-ticking-coronavirus-bomb-report/story-0xZi98Vpky3Kzl9qIjCYtJ.html
08-05-2020||World||Wuhan market had role in coronavirus outbreak, but more research needed: WHO||A wholesale market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan played a role in the outbreak of the novel coronavirus last year, as the source or possibly as an “amplifying setting”, the World Health Organization said on Friday, calling for more research.Chinese authorities shut down the market in January as part of efforts to halt the spread of the virus and ordered a temporary ban on trade and consumption of wildlife. “The market played a role in the event, that’s clear. But what role we don’t know, whether it was the source or amplifying setting or just a coincidence that some cases were detected in and around that market,” said Dr Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO expert on food safety and zoonotic viruses that cross the species barrier from animals to humans.It was not clear whether live animals or infected vendors or shoppers may have brought the virus into the market, he told a Geneva news briefing. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said there is “a significant amount of evidence” the virus came from the Wuhan laboratory, although he has also said there wasn’t certainty. No public evidence has linked the outbreak to the lab in Wuhan and scientists have said the coronavirus appears to have developed in nature. A German intelligence report cast doubts on Pompeo’s allegations, Der Spiegel reported. Ben Embarek did not address the accusations. He noted that it took researchers a year to identify camels as the source of the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) virus, a coronavirus that emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread in the Middle East, adding: “It’s not too late.” “What is important, what would be of great help, is to get hold of the virus before it adapted to humans, before the version we have now. Because then we would better understand how it adapted to humans, how it evolved,” he said.“In terms of investigations, China has most probably, most likely, all the expertise needed to do these investigations. They have lot of very qualified researchers to that,” he said.A common sight across Asia, wet markets traditionally sell fresh produce and live animals, such as fish, in the open air. Many markets worldwide that sell live animals must be better regulated and hygiene conditions improved, and some should be closed down, Ben Embarek said. “But the vast majority can be fixed, can be better organised.”It is often a question of controlling waste management, the movement of people and goods, and of separating live animals from animal products and from fresh goods, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-market-had-role-in-coronavirus-outbreak-but-more-research-needed-who/story-WfWt4rXFVPehjduOPKjrQO.html

08-05-2020||World||Early Covid lockdown in China could have reduced cases: Study||Coronavirus cases in China could have been “dramatically reduced” if the government had locked down the first outbreak epicentre Wuhan, restricted inter-provincial travel and banned public gatherings one-to-three weeks before it did on January 23, a new international research paper has said.Published in the science journal Nature, this week, the researchers said – in a rare argument based on a mathematical model -- that earlier implementation of “non-pharmaceutical interventions” (NPIs) could have also reduced the “geographical range of the outbreak”.Conversely, a delay – later than January 23 -- could have made the outbreak far worse, they said.If the lockdowns and closing down of public places were not carried out by the time they were done, infections could have increased 67 times to 7.7 million in the country by February. Beijing has so far aggressively argued that it was the unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan -- where the coronavirus first emerged late last year – and then of the province Hubei not only curbed the Covid-19 spread in China but also gave the rest of the world a wider window of time to prepare for the eventual pandemic.The new paper compiled by researchers from University of Southampton in th UK, Fudan University and Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in China and the US’s Harvard Medical School and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health indicates the scenario if the those measures were taken earlier.The researchers took February 29 as the base date when they estimated that the number of Covid-19 cases in China were 114325 – the official number was close to 80000.From January 23, three major groups of NPIs were implemented to contain the spread of the outbreak in China: First, inter-city travel restrictions were put in place; second was the early identification and isolation of cases and lastly, contact restrictions and social distancing measures, together with personal preventive actions, such as hand washing, were implemented to reduce the community-level exposure risk, the researchers said.If these interventions in China could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier, cases could have been dramatically reduced by 66 percent, 86 percent or 95 percent respectively, they wrote.“The geographical range of affected areas would also shrink from 308 cities to 192, 130, and 61 cities, respectively”.“Earlier implementation of NPIs could have significantly reduced the magnitude and geographical range of the outbreak, but equally, a delayed response would have led to a larger outbreak,” the researchers said.Lai Shengjie, one of the researchers involved in creating the model, said it was difficult for China to implement the NPIs before as not much was known about the pathogen initially.“This is just a theoretical estimate from model, but without considering the impact of actual socioeconomic factors and the capacity of identifying this novel virus at the early stage of the outbreak. Considering that this is totally a new pathogen, it did need time to collect evidence and identify viruses, and isolate viruses in the early stage of an outbreak,” Lai, a research fellow ongeography and environmental science at the University of Southampton, told HT over email.“I would like to say that China’s actions to lockdown a 11-million population city within two weeks after isolating the virus was very commendable. Because at that time, the necessity of such measures was still suspect, because the relevant evidence is still very limited, but now similar interventions have been widely adopted,” Lai said.The study indicated that early detection and isolation did more to curb the contagion than the other two NPIs, but all three combined interventions achieved the strongest and most rapid effects. The researchers said NPIs should be continued as China gradually opens up.“Given travel and work resuming in China, the country should consider at least the partial continuation of NPIs to ensure that the Covid-19 outbreak is sustainably controlled for the first wave of this outbreak.”“For example, early case identification and isolation should be maintained, which may also help to prevent and delay the arrival of a second wave, considering the increasing numbers of cases imported from other countries the presence of asymptomatic or subclinical infections found in China,” the research said.On the ongoing lockdown in India, the researcher Lai said the intensity depends on the combined interventions.“I don’t have the details of interventions in India, but I think the effects depend on the intensity and duration of combined interventions implemented in each country, not just the travel restriction and social distancing measures,” Lai said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-covid-lockdown-in-china-could-have-reduced-cases-study/story-oF0RTV1Uhj2hZ4NFmHqchI.html

The comments from foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying came as China has faced increasing global pressure in recent weeks to allow an international investigation into the origins of the pandemic.The review should be conducted in an “open, transparent and inclusive manner” under the leadership of World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Hua said at a briefing.Also read: US may suffer major blow if China produces vaccine against Covid-19 firstBut she added that it should be at an “appropriate time after the pandemic is over”.China also stressed that any inquiry should be based on the International Health Regulations, and be authorised by the World Health Assembly or Executive Committee - the WHO’s dual governing bodies.Numerous countries including France, Germany and Britain have urged greater transparency from China over its handling of the virus, while the US and Australia have also led calls for an international inquiry into the origins of the pandemic.Also read| Early Covid lockdown in China could have reduced cases: StudyChina has previously rejected similar calls for an investigation, accusing the US of “politicising the issue”.China has strenuously denied accusations it concealed information relating to the initial outbreak, insisting it has always shared information with the WHO and other countries in a timely manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-supports-who-led-review-of-global-covid-19-response/story-OQMF6Pj8KokOo2wTcz5HJM.html
08-05-2020||World||Turning oil wells back on is trickier than shutting them off||With thousands of oil wells choking back or completely shutting off production, companies already are looking ahead to what may prove to be an even bigger challenge: turning wells back on.U.S. and Canadian oil producers are curbing as much as 4.5 million barrels of daily supplies, according to Plains All American Pipeline LP. In the U.S. alone, drillers have announced plans to halt more than 600,000 barrels of daily output this month and next, said Rystad Energy AS. Old-style, conventional wells were the first to go down and the closures are expanding to some of the horizontal gushers that represent shale drillers’ prize assets.Although shutting down a well can be a relatively simple -- and even remote-controlled -- process, industry executives and their engineering teams aren’t altogether sure how smoothly an idle well can be restarted.“When you shut in wells, especially for a long period of time, you have a lot of surprises,” Clay Bretches, an executive vice president at Apache Corp., said during a conference call with analysts on Thursday. “Some of them are good and some of them are bad.”Executives are careful about disclosing which wells are being curtailed -- which involves squeezing back on the volume of crude flowing out of the well -- versus those that are completely shut down. That’s because reversing a total shutdown presents a more challenging set of tasks and costs.Houston-based Apache has shut about 2,500 wells, and Bretches said the company is taking “great pains” to make sure they’re being preserved. That includes preventing corrosion and maintaining equipment that sits atop the well in remote fields.WPX Energy Inc., which plans to shut in a total of about 45,000 barrels of oil a day this month and possibly next, said it could be as simple as remotely opening up valves or speeding up electric pumps installed at the bottom of some wells. But the company cautioned against the expectation that it could be done quickly.Restoration Costs“It wouldn’t be as simple as ‘just give us a couple days and we’ll be back up running at 100%,’” said WPX Chief Operating Officer Clay Gaspar. “Anybody who says that, they’re probably short-changing their field organization just a touch.”That’s why deciding whether to shut a well involves more than just comparing operating costs and oil prices, according to Rystad. Producers also must weigh the cost and mechanical difficulty of restoring those wells back to pre-curtailed volumes.“When you start back up from the level we’re at, we do expect to have some start-up capital,” said Jeff Alvarez, head of investor relations of Occidental Petroleum Corp., which is shutting down about 5% of its production next month. “It’s things like, just when I spend $1 today, I don’t get production for a couple of months from that.”Cimarex Energy Co. said the obstacles to reopening wells mostly revolve around speed and costs, rather than any threats to the structural integrity of the rocks themselves. The Denver-based explorer held an internal technical session recently that looked at how its reservoirs would be affected by shut-ins, and the results showed that they were likely to be “just fine.”Pipeline Capacity“We think we’re in pretty good shape with our reservoirs to shut them in and bring them back when we need,” CEO Tom Jorden said during a conference call.Oil companies aren’t the only ones who have to think about the long-term impacts of shuttered wells. Millions of miles of pipelines crisscross the continent to haul crude from the field to refineries and export terminals. As supplies drop, so does demand for pipeline capacity.Pipeline operator Targa Resources Corp. was asked Thursday if the wells its system serves would ever ramp up to previous volumes.“I think for the most part, we’d expect the shut-in volumes to come back and perform well,” Targa CEO Matt Meloy said. “Could there be some older, really low-rate vertical wells ... which they shut-in and just don’t bring back? I think there could be some amount of those.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turning-oil-wells-back-on-is-trickier-than-shutting-them-off/story-yvD7KAA7VOK6TShrEgvCTO.html

Russia now ranks fourth in Europe in terms of the total number of cases, according to an AFP tally, behind countries where the epidemic hit considerably earlier: Britain, Italy and Spain.On Thursday Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced an extension of a lockdown in the capital, where most cases are concentrated, to May 31.He also brought in a rule that people will have to wear masks and gloves in public transport and shops or face fines from Tuesday.Residents of the capital are only allowed to leave their homes for brief trips to a shop, to walk dogs or to travel to essential jobs with a permit.Russia has a national non-working period until May 11 that so far has not been extended.On Saturday, when the country usually marks Soviet victory in World War II with large-scale military parades, there will only be fly-pasts and fireworks. For the first time, President Vladimir Putin will give a speech by the Eternal Flame memorial beside the Kremlin walls instead of during a parade on Red Square.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-coronavirus-cases-top-10-000-for-sixth-day/story-uKTUZ7KdEKzwfntmkhHMNI.html

08-05-2020||World||Germany doubts US claims of China Covid-19 lab leak: Report||Germany’s defence ministry and BND foreign spy agency have privately cast doubt on American claims that the coronavirus pandemic originated in a Chinese lab, media reported Friday.An internal memo prepared for Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer “classifies the American claims as a calculated attempt to distract” from Washington’s own failings, Der Spiegel reported.US President Donald Trump is attempting “to distract from his own mistakes and direct Americans’ anger at China”, Spiegel cited from the document.A defence ministry spokesman declined to confirm the existence of the memo when contacted by AFP.Meanwhile public broadcaster NDR cast doubt on the existence of a reported joint paper from the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance of Britain, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand that allegedly accuses China of playing down the extent of the virus outbreak.BND chiefs told MPs in a confidential Berlin parliamentary committee hearing that its “Five Eyes” partners claimed to have “no knowledge” of such a report, NDR wrote.Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office, responsible for oversight of the BND, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump on Wednesday described the coronavirus pandemic as “the worst attack we’ve ever had”, calling it “worse than Pearl Harbor... worse than the World Trade Center” and saying it “could have been stopped in China”.On Friday, Johns Hopkins University’s real-time tally showed 2,448 US coronavirus deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the American total to 75,543, while total cases numbered over 1.2 million.On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo renewed his widely contested charge that the coronavirus pandemic likely originated in a Chinese laboratory.“We don’t have certainty, and there is significant evidence that this came from the laboratory. Those statements can both be true,” he told reporters, adding later that China had “perpetrated” the virus.Beijing has repeatedly hit back at the claims. “We urge the US side to stop shifting the blame to China and turn to facts,” China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying retorted at a press briefing Thursday.Spiegel reported that German authorities also targeted China with criticism, citing “BND information” that Beijing pressured the World Health Organization to delay issuing a global warning after the initial outbreak in Wuhan.“In a January 21 telephone call, Chinese President Xi Jinping asked WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to hold back information about person-to-person transmission and delay a pandemic warning,” the news weekly wrote on its website.“According to the BND’s assessment, China’s information policy cost four to six weeks of time to fight the virus worldwide,” Spiegel added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-doubts-us-claims-of-china-covid-19-lab-leak-report/story-mOpNxVtYuX9DowQbgcPMcL.html

He said Abe proposed the talks.“It was extremely meaningful to be able to reassure Japan-US cooperation via telephone talks between the two leaders just as the international society is expected to unite and tackle the (pandemic),” Suga said.The Japanese health ministry, in a rare fast-track process, approved Gilead Sciences Inc.’s antiviral drug remdesivir on Thursday to treat Covid-19 patients. The approval was granted under a special fast-track process only four days after the company filed an application.Japan is still under a coronavirus state of emergency, which was extended this week until the end of May, though there have been no hard lockdowns.The United States has more than 1.2 million reported infections, with deaths exceeding 75,000, while Japan has about 15,500 cases and 580 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-us-agree-to-cooperate-in-covid-19-fight/story-MjIekePZSaNGfWGmi52fPL.html

There was no known casualties on either side, but the incident was a reminder of persistent tensions on the peninsula.A statement from the North’s Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces accused South Korea of mobilizing fighter jets and warships for drills in the western sea boundary on Wednesday.“Such reckless move of the military warmongers of the south side is the height of the military confrontation,” said the statement, carried by the North’s state media. “This is a grave provocation which can never be overlooked and this situation demands a necessary reaction from us.”North Korea said the South Korean drills violated 2018 agreements that require both countries to halt firing exercises along their land and sea borders to lower front-line animosities.South Korea’s Defense Ministry said the drills didn’t break the agreements because they took place in its western waters, about 300 kilometres (186 miles) away from the sea boundary. A ministry official, requesting anonymity citing department rules, said that South Korea has been maintaining its military readiness without violating the 2018 agreements.On Sunday, Seoul said several bullets fired from North Korea struck one of their front-line guard posts before South Korean soldiers fired 20 warning shots in response. South Korea sent a message requesting North Korea explain the incident, but the North has yet to reply, according to the Defense Ministry.Relations between the two significantly improved in 2018 as their leaders held three rounds of summit talks. But much of their rapprochement became stalled as broader diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington came to a standstill due to disputes over terms under which North Korea can fully abandon its nuclear program.The Koreas remain split along the world’s most heavily fortified border since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. The United States stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea to help deter potential aggression from North Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-slams-south-for-reckless-drills-along-sea-border/story-MtBqLZ9UQwRwCF7Ix1L1CM.html

08-05-2020||World||Amid Covid-19 pandemic, the world’s working poor hustle to survive||From Kenya to Argentina, untold millions who were already struggling to get by on the economic margins have had their lives made even harder by pandemic lockdowns, layoffs and the loss of a chance to earn from a hard day’s work.More than four out of five people in the global labour force of 3.3 billion have been hit by full or partial workplace closures, according to the International labour Organization, which says 1.6 billion workers in the informal economy “stand in immediate danger of having their livelihoods destroyed.” The toll for families is hunger and poverty that are either newfound or even more grinding than before. Hunkering down at home to ride out the crisis isn’t an option for many, because securing the next meal means hustling to find a way to sell, clean, drive or otherwise work, despite the risk.How the world’s poor get through this pandemic will help determine how quickly the global economy recovers and how much aid is needed to keep countries afloat.In Kenya, Judith Andeka has seen tough times before.The 33-year-old mother of five lost her husband two years ago and was left to make ends meet on just $2.50 to $4 a day from washing clothes in Nairobi’s Kibera, one of the world’s biggest slums.But things were never as tough as they are now.Neighbors aren’t going to work because of restrictions on movement, so they can’t afford her services. Even if they could, they don’t want her handling their laundry due to virus concerns.“I haven’t had a good day for the last two weeks,” Andeka said.She’s been forced to send all five kids to live with relatives who are slightly better off: “I had no choice, because how do you tell a 2-year-old you have no food to give them?” In Argentina, Rosemary Páez Carabajal pushed a coffee cart on the streets of Argentina’s capital, until the lockdown forced her to stop.Páez Carabajal, her blacksmith husband who’s also out of work and their two children rent a single room in a two-story brick building for the equivalent of $119 a month.Now the cart sits idle in the hall, and the home is stacked with textbooks as the couple try to home-school their lone school-age child, a 7-year-old son.They are dipping into meager savings and relying on a one-time government aid voucher worth about $150. For now, their landlord is not collecting rent.Páez Carabajal worries her small business may not survive even after restrictions are eased.“People are going to have doubts about buying because the disease is transmitted by grabbing things,” she said.The coronavirus came at a time of already painful recession in Argentina, with more than a third of its 44 million residents in poverty, according to figures from late 2019. Some 3 million have requested food aid in recent weeks, adding to the 8 million getting such assistance before the pandemic.In Cairo, the sprawling and bustling metropolis of some 20 million people, the “ahwa,” or coffee shop, was among the first casualties of a shutdown order for many Egyptian businesses.No longer were they allowed to offer “sheesha,” the hookah waterpipe so popular in the Middle East. Before long they were closed altogether.That cost Hany Hassan his job. He hadn’t been making much — $5 a day — but it was enough to feed his family.“We are financially ruined,” said the 40-year-old father of four.Unable to find work in a relatively pricey Cairo he could no longer afford, he moved back to family in his hometown of Mallawi, about 190 miles (300 kilometers) to the south.But his chances for work there are even dimmer. Chronic back pain means he can’t do the manual labour jobs many people work in the provinces.Jobless for over a month, he goes out daily looking for work but comes back empty-handed every night. To keep afloat, he’s borrowed money.Before the pandemic, one in three Egyptians or roughly 33 million people were living on about $1.45 per day, and around 6% were in extreme poverty, or living on less than a dollar a day, according to the country’s official statistics agency.The government has created an emergency fund for vulnerable people, offering the equivalent of around $32 a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-covid-19-pandemic-the-world-s-working-poor-hustle-to-survive/story-QVkatcz7GFqW2mMoeoPzPM.html
08-05-2020||World||Ahead of WHO meet, chorus for Covid-19 probe that puts China under the lens||The chorus for transparency and investigation into the outbreak of the coronavirus disease is growing louder in the run up to the truncated session of the World Health Assembly 10 days later.The disease, which originated in China late last year, has killed more than a quarter of a million people across the world in a little over four months. China has been blamed by many countries for not giving the world a heads up about the disease that could have minimised its spread. Questions have also been asked of the World Health Organisation that has been accused of being overly deferential to China.The loudest criticism of China and WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has come from the United States President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Last month, the US suspended funding to the WHO to drive home the point.But the United States isn’t the only one upset about China and WHO’s role.Over the last week and more, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also lent the grouping’s backing to calls for an investigation into the origin of Covid outbreak.Also Read: China must come clean on Covid-19| OpinionThis week, the European Union declared that it would move a resolution at the World Health Assembly for a timely review of the international response to the coronavirus pandemic including the World Health Organisation’s performance.Diplomats in Washington and Geneva suggest that the resolution, which was being drafted in consultation with a large number of countries, presented a huge test for China in the run up to the global health body’s annual meeting.Beijing has been under fire over its early handling of the virus, which has pushed the global economy toward recession as it spreads around the world. Cases have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories since they were first identified in China in December 2019.British defence secretary Ben Wallace too questioned the role of China in the Covid-19 outbreak, asserting that China needs to be open and transparent about what it learnt, its shortcomings also successes.Ben Wallace’s remarks are seen in context of British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab’s statement in April that underscored the need to ask “hard questions” about how the coronavirus came about and how it could have been stopped.Swedish Health Minister Lena Hallengren made it clear last month that her government wanted the origin of the virus probed besides an investigation into the WHO’s role in the pandemic.It is in this context, diplomats in Washington said, that China appeared to have started approaching governments in countries for support in face of public criticism. This strategy was outed in Germany where Chinese diplomats approached German government officials to request them to make “positive public statements” on China’s handling of the disease. Officials in Berlin had declined the request.Beijing has had to battle accusations that it had attempted to cover up the outbreak of the disease and told the world about the disease much too late. For instance, questions are being asked why Chinese authorities stopped flights from Wuhan to the rest of the country after the Covid-19 outbreak but allowed international flights. Or why it clamped down on research by Chinese scientists into the origins of the virus.Authorities had reprimanded doctors including Li Wenliang, who later passed away, for sharing warnings about the coronavirus infection risk in WeChat groups in late December.Criticism about this approach to censor information reignited on Friday after a line that referred to the coronavirus disease being detected in China and spreading to the world was removed from an article written for a Chinese daily by 27 European ambassadors to commemorate the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the EU and China.But there have been several instances of Chinese diplomats posted around the world launching attacks on the media for what they describe as efforts to politicise the Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ahead-of-who-meet-chorus-for-covid-19-probe-that-puts-china-under-the-lens/story-4LjdRdoJkky44nhOxJoWeO.html
08-05-2020||World||Operation Warp Speed: The race to save US prestige and find Covid-19 vaccine||When the Soviet Union put the first man into space in 1961, the shock to America’s self-confidence was electric. If China should be first to produce a successful vaccine against the coronavirus, US prestige is likely to suffer a similar blow.President Donald Trump is putting everything he’s got into a research effort dubbed Operation Warp Speed, which pulls together pharmaceutical companies, government agencies and the military. So is China, which has a head start at a time the two countries are already engaged in a fight for dominance impacting everything from trade to the roll-out of 5G communications networks.The stakes in finding a vaccine against the coronavirus couldn’t be higher. In just a few months the disease has claimed more than a quarter of a million lives and shattered economies worldwide.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicWhile many leaders are talking about global collaboration, history suggests that national interests will dominate — the government that can immunize its workforce first stands to gain not just economic advantage, but the validation of its technological prowess and international influence. If that government is in Beijing, the impact could be as dramatic as Yuri Gagarin’s trip into orbit almost 60 years ago. “When it’s tense like it is now between the US and China, every single thing gets distorted by the geopolitics,” said David Fidler, a specialist in cyber security and global health at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations. Should Beijing produce the first vaccine, the US “will worry that China would weaponize the vaccine in geopolitical terms,” he said. Both the US and China have played down talk of competition, with Chinese officials in particular stressing the common nature of the threat from Covid-19. No vaccine has ever been made on the kinds of schedules being targeted, counted in months rather than years. Scientists familiar with the process warn it isn’t certain that one can be developed at all, let alone by the end of the year. So the risk of disappointment is high.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakIn a recent town hall on Fox News, Trump said the US was working with both Britain and Australia on vaccine projects, and wasn’t focused on who got there first. “I really don’t care,” he said. “If it’s another country, I’ll take my hat off to them. We have to come up with a vaccine.”Health Secretary Alex Azar said this week that the US expects to be able to start manufacturing the drugs itself, whoever makes the scientific breakthrough.Still, in the first months of the pandemic, signs of geopolitical rivalry have been there for all to see, and trust lacking even among allies.The state government in Berlin accused the US of “modern piracy,” for allegedly snatching away shipments of Chinese protective gear earmarked for Germany, a claim denied by the US The Europeans are bringing in new rules to protect their pharmaceutical firms from foreign acquisitions. China has irritated western governments with highly publicized airlifts of medical aid to selected countries and suggestions its success in containing the virus is proof of a superior political system.The US is signalling that its own efforts are focused on protecting the American people first. Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday described the US vaccine program as aiming “to develop a vaccine for the people of the United States.” The administration is targeting 300 million doses — enough to inoculate most of the country — by January.China’s research process is for now more advanced, with a total of 508 volunteers joining a second phase trial for a potential vaccine that the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences is developing with a Tianjin-based company, CanSino Biologics. Results from the trial could be known as soon as this month.Russia has at least four vaccine projects underway, including at Novosibirsk Vector, a laboratory that once worked on Soviet bio-weapons programs, according to Sergei Netesov, a former executive at the lab who now teaches at Novosibirsk State University. The goal, he says, is for Russia to make sure its own population has protection without being dependent on its rivals.Others are in the mix, too, with the UK saying that if a promising Oxford University project is successful, Britons will be at the front to the line.To be sure, France and Germany are leading the charge for a more cooperative approach, securing pledges of 7.4 billion euro ($8 billion) at a virtual Group of Twenty fund raiser on May 4. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, meanwhile, has said it will build manufacturing capacity to make as many seven vaccines available, even before they exist, an unprecedented effort to ensure wide and rapid availability.“This pandemic is a global challenge and we will therefore also only be able to overcome it globally,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said at the G-20 video conference. “We are ready to go new ways.”But past experience isn’t encouraging. During the 2009 H1N1 flu epidemic, governments also issued joint declarations committing themselves to collaboration in the development and distribution of vaccines. Nevertheless, as soon as they were available, countries that could afford to bought up doses and hoarded them, to ensure their populations would get inoculated first.The US snubbed Monday’s G-20 vaccine initiative, objecting to the involvement of the World Health Organization, while officials in both Washington and Beijing have indulged in conspiracy theories and blame games to accuse the other of responsibility for the virus. Trump has blamed the WHO for failing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and halted US funding to the organization. China is emerging first from its lockdown to reboot its economy, while the US and Europe are still struggling to contain the virus and piling on vast sums of national debt to cushion the economic impact, risking long periods of slow growth ahead.Even the G-20 leadership of Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron is in part designed to compensate for the failure of the European Union’s collective response to the coronavirus so far, according to Stefan Lehne, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe, a Brussels-based think tank. Perceived German and EU failures to help Italy early in the crisis caused resentment and opened a diplomatic window for China and Russia, both of which sent high profile shipments of medical aid to Italy.“Bill Gates said this is like a world war and we are all on the same side,” says Lehne. “This is not so evident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-going-all-in-on-a-vaccine-he-may-still-get-beaten-by-china/story-xU6PKa9DG0QDYF8G9ZLB1N.html
08-05-2020||World||Most Covid patients may lose sense of smell by third day of infection: Study||Loss of the sense of smell is most likely to occur by the third day of infection with the novel coronavirus, according to a study of over 100 Covid-19 patients which may help public health experts better identify those carrying the virus without adverse symptoms. The telephonic study, whose results were published in the journal Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, examined characteristics and symptoms of 103 patients who were diagnosed with Covid-19 over a six-week period. The patients from Aarau, Switzerland provided data on the number of days they had Covid-19 symptoms, and the timing and severity of their loss of smell, said study co-author, Ahmad Sedaghat from the University of Cincinnati in the US. Of the 103 patients, at least 61 per cent reported reduced or lost sense of smell, Sedaghat said, adding that the mean onset for reduction or loss in the sense of smell was 3.4 days. “We also found in this study that the severity of the loss of smell is correlated with how bad your other Covid-19 symptoms will be,” Sedaghat said. “If the anosmia, also known as loss of smell, is worse, the patients reported worse shortness of breath, and more severe fever and cough,” he added. According to the scientist, the relationship between decreased sense of smell and the rest of the Covid-19 is something to be aware of. “If someone has a decreased sense of smell with Covid-19, we know they are within the first week of the disease course, and there is still another week or two to expect,” he added.The findings indicated that a decreased sense of smell may be an indicator of patients early in the disease course as well as those who may go on to develop more severe symptoms, like shortness of breath, Sedaghat said. He cautioned that while the loss of smell is an indicator of Covid-19, it’s not the only factor. “When you start to experience serious symptoms of Covid-19 which include shortness of breath and respiratory distress, that’s when you should become alarmed,” he said. Younger patients and women in the study were also more likely to experience a decreased loss of smell, the study noted. About 50 per cent of study patients experienced a stuffy nose and 35 per cent experienced a runny nose. According to Sedaghat, this is important since previous studies indicated that these nasal symptoms were rare in Covid-19, and these symptoms were attributed to allergy and not the novel coronavirus. “This just means that greater awareness is needed of Covid-19’s nasal symptoms so people are not running around sneezing in public and thinking it is okay since this is just allergies,” Sedaghat said. “It very well could be Covid-19 and wearing masks as protective gear for others you encounter is a good idea,” he added. Understanding more about loss of smell and Covid-19 is important for a public health perspective, the scientist cautioned. “No one is going to die because of a loss of the sense of smell and it’s not the symptom that will kill anyone,” he said, but adding that, “it is important because it helps us to identify these Covid-19 patients as asymptomatic carriers so they don’t spread the disease to others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-covid-patients-may-lose-sense-of-smell-by-third-day-of-infection-study/story-amScEAgZ7AuIdg5n33J7YK.html
08-05-2020||World||Blood thinners may boost survival rates of Covid-19 infected patients: Report||Treating coronavirus patients with blood thinners may help in boosting their prospects for survival, according to preliminary findings from physicians at New York City’s largest hospital system that offers another source of hope in treating the deadly infection.The Washington Post reported that the results of the analysis, conducted over 2,733 patients, were published on Wednesday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.In an interview to the newspaper, Valentin Fuster, a physician in chief at Mount Sinai Hospital and one of the study’s authors, said that the observations were based only on a review of medical records and that more rigorous and randomised studies are needed to draw broader conclusions.But the results have been promising, he said.“My opinion is cautious, but I must tell you I think this is going to help. This is the opening of the door for what drugs to use and what questions to answer,” the physician further stated.Since March, when coronavirus hit Europe and the United States, doctors have been reporting mysterious blood clots, which can be gel-like or even semisolid, in a significant subset of coronavirus patients. Autopsies of patients who died of respiratory arrest have shown that some had unusual micro clots in their lungs rather than the typical damage expected.Last month, doctors reported in the New England Journal of Medicine on five unusual cases of COVID-19 positive people in their 30s and 40s experiencing large strokes.The Mount Sinai study focused on hospitalised patients who were treated from March 14 to April 11. Among the patients, those who were not on ventilators and treated with blood thinners died at similar rates in comparison to those who did not receive blood thinners. But the group of patients who received blood thinners lived longer -- a median of 21 days compared to 14 days, the study said.For patients on ventilators, the difference was more significant. About 63 per cent of patients who did not receive the medications died compared with 29 per cent who received the treatment.Another critical finding of the study was that giving blood thinners to these patients appeared to be relatively safe. There was not a significant difference in the most dangerous side effect of anticoagulants -- bleeding -- in those who were on the drugs and those who were not.Fuster said that as a result of the analysis, the hospital system changed its treatment protocols several days ago to begin giving higher doses of blood thinners to the patients infected with COVID-19.Deepak Bhatt, a professor at Harvard Medical School who specialises in interventional cardiology, called the paper “a very important study” with the blood issues in COVID-19 patients having evolved from just a suspicion to a well-recognised complication of the virus. “What we are figuring now is what do we do now that we know in terms of treatments,” he said.A number of medical societies, including the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis and the American Society of Hematology, have put out guidance recommending the use of blood thinners for some COVID-19 patients, but the advice has taken a conservative approach.“It is a delicate balance between clotting and bleeding, especially when patients are as sick as some of the ones who have COVID-19,” said Geoffrey Barnes, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan who works in cardiovascular medicine.“A week ago, we were making some educated guesses on how to prevent blood clots. This is the first time we have seen data that says higher doses may possibly be effective and safe,” he was quoted as saying.Doctors caring for the sickest coronavirus patients confront a limited arsenal of treatments. On May 1, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorisation for the antiviral drug remdesivir in patients who are hospitalised and seriously ill.But trials of other treatments, including those involving Hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug touted by US President Donald Trump, have been stopped because of a lack of efficacy and concerns about toxicity.In late April, scientists also reported that an arthritis drug made by Regeneron and Sanofi that had drawn enthusiasm from investors early on produced disappointing results in clinical trials, according to The Washington Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blood-thinners-may-boost-survival-rates-of-covid-19-infected-patients-report/story-ZoaHyGBIecseqITSsPabJK.html
08-05-2020||World||End ‘tsunami of hate and xenophobia’ sparked by Covid-19, says UN Chief||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called Friday for an “all-out effort” to end the “tsunami of hate and xenophobia” sparked by the novel coronavirus pandemic, without naming specific countries.“The pandemic continues to unleash a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scaremongering,” Guterres said in a statement.“Anti-foreigner sentiment has surged online and in the streets. Anti-Semitic conspiracy theories have spread and Covid-19-related anti-Muslim attacks have occurred.”According to Guterres, migrants and refugees have been “vilified as a source of the virus -- and then denied access to medical treatment.”Meanwhile, “contemptible memes have emerged suggesting” that older people, some of the most vulnerable to the virus, “are also the most expendable,” he said.Additionally, “journalists, whistleblowers, health professionals, aid workers and human rights defenders are being targeted simply for doing their jobs,” Guterres said.The UN chief appealed for “an all-out effort to end hate speech globally,” and singled out educational institutions to help teach “digital literacy” to young people -- whom he called “captive and potentially despairing audiences.”Guterres also called on “the media, especially social media companies, to do much more to flag and... remove racist, misogynist and other harmful content.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/end-tsunami-of-hate-and-xenophobia-sparked-by-covid-19-says-un-chief/story-K2Mvobkvo0YAnN1zsBQGqN.html
08-05-2020||World||North Korea’s Kim praises Xi Jinping for Covid-19 outbreak control in China||North Korea says leader Kim Jong Un sent a personal message to Chinese President Xi Jinping praising what he described as China’s success in getting its coronavirus epidemic under control.The report by North Korea’s state media followed an assessment by South Korea’s spy agency that the pandemic is hurting the North’s economy, already crippled by decades of policy failures and U.S.-led international sanctions over its nuclear weapons program.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageChina is North Korea’s most significant ally and economic lifeline, accounting for about 90% of the country’s external trade. With China’s Covid-19 caseload easing, some experts say the North could reach out to China to reinvigorate cross-border trade that had been significantly reduced in past months.The Korean Central News Agency says Kim in the message to Xi “congratulated him, highly appreciating that he is seizing a chance of victory in the war against the unprecedented epidemic.” It did not specify when the message was sent.South Korea’s spy agency recently told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing that trade volume between North Korea and China in the first quarter declined 55% from a year earlier. In March, the bilateral trade volume suffered a 91% drop, lawmakers cited the agency as saying.North took intense action to avoid an outbreak by closing its borders in January and quarantining thousands of people. It still contends it has had no cases of infection, though many outsiders doubt that.A South Korean lawmaker who discussed the spy agency’s findings earlier this week said the National Intelligence Service cannot rule out an outbreak in the North. But the agency concluded skyrocketing food prices and panic-buying in Pyongyang and a reduction in Kim Jong Un’s public appearances this year were evidence of the impact, the lawmaker said.South Korea reported 12 fresh cases of the new coronavirus, its first increase above 10 in five days. Figures by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention brought national totals to 10,822 cases and 256 deaths. Three of the new cases were detected in the hardest-hit city of Daegu, and three were passengers screened at airports. As its caseload has slowed, South Korea has relaxed social distancing guidelines, allowing sports to resume and preparing to reopen schools. South Korea’s professional soccer league will begin its new season on Friday, following Tuesday’s baseball openers. Still, health officials warning of new infections urged people to reconsider visiting their elderly parents on Friday, which is national parents’ day, and over the weekend.China announced one new virus case, a local infection in Jilin province, and 16 new cases of people who are not showing symptoms. Just 260 people remain hospitalized and 890 are in isolation as suspected cases or for having tested positive but without showing symptoms. China has reported 4,633 deaths among 82,886 cases. Also, China’s football teams will temporarily cut players’ pay to help teams manage losses. The head of China’s football association, Chen Xuyuan, also told state broadcaster CCTV that matches would resume on a staggered schedule but gave no dates.The United Nations is appealing to governments, companies and billionaires to contribute to a $6.7 billion appeal to fight the coronavirus pandemic in vulnerable countries. U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock warns that a failure to help could lead to a “hunger pandemic,” famine, riots and more conflict. Lowcock said there is already evidence of incomes plummeting and jobs disappearing, food supplies falling and prices soaring, and children missing vaccinations and meals — and the peak of the pandemic isn’t expected to hit the world’s poorest countries for three to six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-praises-xi-jinping-for-covid-10-outbreak-control-in-china/story-tYV5rBcTpF3gBHUW3gBD3N.html

When she failed to return three days later, police were informed and the man was placed in detention in Shaanxi province’s Jingbian county.Rescuers said despite the woman’s ordeal, she was faintly calling for help as she was freed, state media said Friday.The China Daily newspaper and other outlets reporting on the case cited a police statement that was not available online. An official reached by phone at the Jingbian county prosecutor’s office confirmed an investigation was underway but declined to give further details. The man would only give his surname, Yan.The man was identified as a 58-year-old with the surname Ma and his 79-year-old mother, surnamed Wang.She is partially paralyzed and her son was apparently fed up with having to constantly take care of her, China Daily reported.Public assistance in much of China is lacking, especially in poor rural areas, and families are generally expected to look after their own elderly relatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/woman-buried-by-her-son-saved-after-3-days-in-grave-say-police/story-7RUOeUUKoyhM4AwgaoTWYM.html
08-05-2020||World||Coronavirus deals ‘powerful blow’ to Putin’s grand plans||The bombastic military parade through Moscow’s Red Square on Saturday was slated to be the spectacle of the year on the Kremlin’s calendar.Standing with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron, President Vladimir Putin would have overseen a 90-minute procession of Russia’s military might, showcasing 15,000 troops and the latest hardware.But that was before the coronavirus pandemic.Now, military jets will roar over an eerily quiet Moscow, spurting red, white and blue smoke to mark 75 years since the defeat of Nazi Germany. Putin will lay flowers at a war memorial near an abandoned Red Square and address a nation growing angry with his handling of the country.The parade is not the only victim of the coronavirus pandemic, which has crippled Russia’s economy, hospitalised the prime minister and slashed Putin’s approval ratings.Russians had been due last month to cast their votes on constitutional reforms that would have paved the way for Putin to stay in power until 2036, but those plans too were scuppered by the virus.What was supposed to be a triumphant spring for Putin has become a political letdown, observers say, one that could be difficult for the president to recover from.“This is the first time in 20 years that Putin is facing a crisis this serious,” said political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya. “This is a new experience for him.”The timing of the pandemic, hitting just as Putin was unveiling major constitutional reforms, amounts to “a powerful blow to his plans”, she told AFP.Approval at historic lowAfter initially reporting fewer cases than in western Europe, Russia has witnessed a grim and steady rise in new coronavirus infections in recent days.Health officials registered another record increase on Thursday and the country now ranks fifth in the world in overall infections.Russia’s death rate is low compared to the European countries hardest hit, but some observers say that discrepancy is due to how the death count is calculated.Putin this week praised the government’s response, saying that by implementing mass testing and keeping fatalities low, Russia had become a model for other countries.“What we did was absolutely right,” he said. “Many foreign countries followed our path.”Yet many Russians appear to disagree. Unlike other world leaders battling the pandemic, Putin’s approval ratings have not rallied in light of the crisis.According to independent pollster Levada, they fell to a historic low of 59 percent last month from 63 percent in March.Already strained by Western sanctions, Russia’s economy is under serious threat from the pandemic, which analysts say could deepen resentment towards the Kremlin.Since Russia imposed a lockdown to slow the spread of the virus, small businesses have struggled to survive and millions of Russians have been left without wages, despite promises from the government to support companies and employees.Igor Nikolayev, director of the Institute for Strategic Analysis at FBK Grant Thornton, said the timing of the crisis was unfortunate as it coincided with a steep fall in the price of oil, a key export which balances the Russian budget.‘Distant from the people’He said Russians were not prepared for this dual shock, noting that 60 percent do not have savings and that real incomes have fallen 7.5 percent over the last year.Russia can weather the storm for around 18 months, he said, thanks to reserves in its sovereign wealth fund of some $150 billion.But if the crisis persists and “life does not become easier, this will affect the attitude of the people to the authorities,” Nikolayev told AFP.Putin could well bounce back. He has weathered many crises over 20 years in power and is credited by many Russians for bringing the country out of the chaos of the 1990s and restoring its global prestige.Officials have said both the parade and the constitutional vote will be held later in 2020, though analyst Andrei Kolesnikov said that alone may not be enough to salvage Putin’s year.Putin “enjoyed Russians’ approval for many years,” said Kolesnikov, of the Carnegie Moscow Centre. “Now he will personally accumulate all their disapproval.”“In the context of the coronavirus crisis, the vote will not mobilise the nation,” he said, and the military parade alone “will not seriously help support Putin’s falling ratings.”Stanovaya said that after so many years in power Putin has “distanced himself from the people” and lost the ability to empathise with Russians.If the Kremlin cannot address economic problems, “social irritation will grow, there will be protests,” she warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-deals-powerful-blow-to-putin-s-grand-plans/story-j54vWnB1RsOiC8HFYkukTI.html
08-05-2020||World||US Supreme Court’s Ginsburg, 87, discharged from hospital||Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, at 87 the US Supreme Court’s oldest member, was discharged on Wednesday from hospital where she was treated for a benign gall bladder condition and took part remotely in arguments in two cases. In a statement released on Wednesday evening, court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said Ginsburg is “doing well and glad to be home” after being discharged from Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.Earlier in the day, her participation in two arguments, conducted by teleconference amid the coronavirus pandemic, marked the latest instance in which the liberal justice withstood a health scare and returned swiftly to her duties on the court, where she has served since 1993. Ginsburg asked a number of questions and her voice sounded hesitant at times but largely remained firm. Ginsburg will return to the Baltimore hospital for outpatient visits in the following weeks, and a gallstone that caused the infection will be removed without the need for a surgical procedure, Arberg added. Ginsburg was treated for pancreatic cancer last year. The first case involved an Obamacare requirement regarding health insurance coverage for women’s birth control. The second involved a federal law cracking down on so-called robocalls.In the first case, Ginsburg posed lengthy questions expressing doubt over a bid by President Donald Trump’s administration to implement rules allowing employers to obtain religious exemptions from the contraception mandate.She told the administration’s lawyer, Solicitor General Noel Francisco, that it has “tossed entirely to the wind what Congress considered to be essential, that women be provided this service, with no hassle and no cost to them.” On Tuesday, Ginsburg was treated for an inflammatory condition of the gallbladder known as acute cholecystitis. Her hospitalization could have posed a risk as it comes amid a pandemic that continues to surge throughout the United States and around the world. The coronavirus has proven to be particularly dangerous in elderly people, especially those with underlying medical issues. Ginsburg has had several health scares in recent years. In November 2018, she broke three ribs in a fall. Subsequent medical tests led to treatment for lung cancer that caused her to miss arguments in January 2019. She returned to the bench, but in August 2019 received radiation therapy to treat pancreatic cancer. She was hospitalized last November for two nights suffering from a fever and chills but returned to work at the court the day after being released.Her health is closely watched because a Supreme Court vacancy would give Republican President Donald Trump the opportunity to appoint a third justice to the nine-member court and move it further to the right. The court currently has a 5-4 conservative majority including two justices appointed by Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-s-ginsburg-87-discharged-from-hospital/story-3VdHdSYbQIFr1ycevCHL1N.html

Both the Hindu and Christian communities in Sindh and Punjab continued to report cases of forced conversion.” In Punjab, girls as young as 14, were forcibly converted and coerced into marriage. In Sindh, the case of two Hindu girls whose families claimed they had been kidnapped for marriage and converted forcibly, drew widespread attention when the Islamabad High Court ruled that the girls were not minors at the time of marriage and allowed them to return to their spouses.“In January, the Supreme Court created a one-person commission to report on the implementation of the 2014 judgment on the protection of minorities’ rights and promotion of a culture of religious and social tolerance,” the report said.“The 22-member parliamentary committee to protect minorities from forced conversions was finally notified in November and tasked with framing legislation against forced conversions.” It said. “The job quota for religious minorities has yet to be implemented. The ordeal of Aasia Bibi, who was convicted of blasphemy in a high profile case in 2010 and then acquitted in 2018, finally ended in January when the Supreme Court threw out a review petition against her acquittal. She left the country in May to be reunited with her family,” the report said.It says the Ahmadi community faced constant persecution and discrimination. In June, four teenagers on their way home after playing cricket set on fire a watchman’s cabin outside an Ahmadi worship place in Wah Cantt. They were identified from CCTV footage and arrested. In April, the Lahore High Court ordered the recovery of a 14-year-old Christian girl from the illegal custody of a Muslim man, Mohammad Zafar, in Faisalabad and sent her back to her family. She confirmed that she was abducted and sold to Zafar, who forced her to convert before coercing her into marriage. A certificate from a local seminary said the girl had embraced Islam out of her ‘free’ will and had been named Ayesha. In September, a 15-year-old Christian girl from Hafizabad was recovered from a madrassah where she had been taken by her school principal. The girl said that her teacher had told her she had automatically become a Muslim because she was studying Arabic. Cases of kidnapping and forced conversion in Hindus are always accompanied by controversy over whether the girls involved converted and married of their own free will. A group of Hindu community members took to the streets of Rahim Yar Khan in April, protesting against the forced conversions of girls. Three people in Bahawalpur were charged with abducting a 12-year-old Hindu girl, Kashmala Devi when she went with members of her family to harvest the wheat crop in the fields of two of the suspects.Highlighting the plight of women in Pakistan, the report says in December, Pakistan was ranked at 151 out of 153 by the World Economic Forum on the Global Gender Gap Index.“Despite the legislation enacted to protect and promote women’s rights in recent years, violence against women has escalated. Women continued to face discrimination in employment, financial inclusion, political representation, and access to connectivity and education. In its second year, Aurat March gave women across Pakistan a public space to articulate their issues, but not without inviting undue criticism and harassment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/religious-minorities-continue-to-suffer-says-pak-s-human-rights-body/story-BYYBToFOisSG4hNJu3WykI.html

08-05-2020||World||Prominent lawyer, Trump donor representing Biden accuser||Tara Reade, a former Senate staffer who alleged Joe Biden sexually assaulted her 27 years ago, is being represented by a prominent lawyer and political donor to President Donald Trump’s 2016 Republican campaign.Attorney Douglas Wigdor told The Associated Press he was not currently being paid for his work with Reade. His firm also denied there was a political motivation for his decision to represent Reade in her accusations against Trump’s presumptive Democratic opponent in the November election.“We have decided to take this matter on because every survivor has the right to competent counsel,” the firm said in a statement.Reade has said for weeks that she was struggling to find a lawyer willing to represent her. She’s accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in 1993, when she worked on his Senate staff. He has denied her allegation.On Thursday, Reade said she wanted Biden to be “held accountable” and called on him to drop out of the presidential race. Her comments came in her first on-camera interview, conducted by former Fox News and NBC News journalist Megyn Kelly.Pressed by a Florida television station about Reade’s comment, Biden reiterated his denial of the allegation.“The truth is what matters,” he told Bay News 9. “In this case, the truth is these claims are flat-out false.”Wigdor is well known for his work on prominent cases related to sexual harassment and assault. He represented six women who accused Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood producer, of sexual misconduct. He has also represented a number of Fox News employees in cases alleging gender and racial discrimination at the network.Wigdor has been a supporter of Trump and provided about $55,000 in campaign contributions in 2016, according to Federal Election Commission records. He has also supported some Democratic politicians, including New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, and has not donated to either Trump’s or Biden’s 2020 campaign.Wigdor said he plans to help Reade in her dealings with the media and any independent investigations into her allegations that might occur. He said the two have not discussed bringing a lawsuit based on her claims, but he did not rule that out.Wigdor suggested Reade’s earlier struggles to find a lawyer to represent her were the result of “politics.”“I think highly of a lot of these people,” he said. “These are my friends and colleagues, people who I respect, but they tend to be Democrats or liberals, and they were not interested, because of that, in representing Tara Reade.”Over the weekend, another attorney, William Moran, told the AP he was working with Reade.Moran, who works at a law firm in Columbia, Maryland, previously wrote and edited for Sputnik, a news agency founded and supported by the Russian state-owned media company Rossiya Segodnya. A January 2017 report released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Russia’s interference in the 2016 campaign said Sputnik was part of “Russia’s state-run propaganda machine,” which “contributed to the influence campaign by serving as a platform for Kremlin messaging to Russian and international audiences.”Reade herself has faced questions about her past writing praising Russian President Vladimir Putin. Reade on Thursday expressed concern to Kelly about having been “called a Russian agent” and said she had received a death threat from someone who “thought I was being a traitor to America.”There is no evidence to suggest Reade or Moran worked at the behest of Russia with respect to the Biden allegation.Moran contacted the AP on behalf of Reade to complain about and seek changes in a story detailing what Reade says she remembers writing in a Senate complaint about Biden. Reade told the AP she did not allege sexual assault in the complaint and did not explicitly use the words “sexual harassment,” though that is the behavior she believes she was describing.Moran told the AP in a text message Thursday that he found the focus on his past work “disgraceful.” He said Reade requested that he reach out to the AP “on a limited matter.”“I do not turn away clients who I believe and who have credible causes of action. I never will,” he said.Wigdor said Reade told him she was connected to Moran through Katie Halper, a podcaster who first interviewed Reade about her sexual assault allegation against Biden in March. It’s unclear how Reade connected with Wigdor, who said he believed she found the firm through “word of mouth and our reputation.”Reade first spoke out about her alleged interactions with Biden in 2019, telling journalists he had touched her inappropriately while she worked on his Senate staff. She came forward in 2020, around the time Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee, with new allegations of assault.She says she didn’t initially disclose the assault allegations because she was scared of backlash and was still coming to terms with what had happened to her.___AP Washington Bureau Chief Julie Pace and writer Brian Slodysko contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prominent-lawyer-trump-donor-representing-biden-accuser/story-Zo06Z6Yd1e5U2YxVmNJdfL.html
08-05-2020||World||Trump says will undergo Covid-19 test daily after military aide tests positive||After his military aide tested positive for coronavirus, US President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would undergo the Covid-19 test every day.A military aide of Trump, whom officials described as a personal valet, tested positive for coronavirus. The president said he had very little contact with him.“I have had very little contact, personal contact, with this gentleman. I know who he is. Good person. But I have had very little contact. (Vice President) Mike (Pence) has had very little contact with him. But Mike was tested and I was tested. We were both tested,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office of the White House.Responding to questions, Trump said he, the vice president and other staff of the White House would be tested for coronavirus every day.“I just had a test. In fact, I had one yesterday and one today, and it is negative. Mike just had a test and it is negative,” he said.“But they do the tests and it just shows you that the fallacy -- it is what I have been saying -- testing is not a perfect art. No matter what you do, testing is not a perfect art. So we test once a week. Now we are going to go testing once a day. But even when you test once a day, somebody could -- something happens where they catch something,” the president said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-will-test-for-covid-19-daily-after-military-aide-tests-positive/story-xSlnPMN6QsamwoQ30nDPgP.html

The country’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the Federal Government will contribute up to CA $ 3 billion for the hike with more expected from the provinces and territories.During his daily media briefing, Trudeau said that “if you are risking your health to keep this country moving and you’re still making minimum wage, you deserve a raise.”While many sectors of economic activity have closed in the country during the coronavirus crisis, others have been critical in ensuring essential services were still being provided. Principal among these are the front line healthcare workers. Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said, “Canada’s front line workers are dealing directly with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic by taking care of Canadians in our hospitals and nursing homes. They deserve our support. This measure will help workers critical to the current Covid-19 response get the compensation they need.”Workers in many other spheres may also benefit, though the sectors will be identified by local governments. Among these are those working at grocery stores, delivery persons, truckers, and some construction workers.In a release, the PMO said such workers deserved a “much-needed wage boost” because while most Canadians were asked to stay at home during the crisis, “millions of Canadians are being called on to go to work every day.”While the scheme was originally expected to be targeted at those making less than CA$ 2500 per month, that figure has been relaxed and provinces and territories will decide on who will qualify for it.Trudeau said these governments had either confirmed, or were in the process of confirming these wage top-up plans for essential workers. He said, “Workers are risking their health to provide us with essential care and services, and we need to make sure that they are paid properly for the work they do every day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wage-hike-for-essential-workers-on-duty-during-covid-19-crisis-in-canada/story-9ULb1pi9dRs1mw4zIS9EaO.html
08-05-2020||World||UN appeals for $6.7 billion to fight virus in poor countries||The United Nations called on governments, companies and billionaires Thursday to contribute to a $6.7 billion fund for fighting the coronavirus pandemic in vulnerable countries, warning that a failure to help could lead to a “hunger pandemic,” famine, riots and more conflict.U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said that “Covid-19 has now affected every country and almost every person on the planet.”He said the U.N.’s initial $2 billion appeal unveiled March 25 was being increased because there is already evidence of incomes plummeting and jobs disappearing, food supplies falling and prices soaring, and children missing vaccinations and meals. He added that the peak of the pandemic isn’t expected to hit the world’s poorest countries for three to six months.Lowcock said in a video briefing launching the new appeal that the poorest countries face “a double whammy” — the health impact of Covid-19 and “the impact of the global recession and the domestic measures taken to contain the virus.”“We must be prepared for a rise in conflict, hunger, poverty and disease as economies contract, export earnings, remittances and tourism disappear, and health systems are put under strain,” he warned. “Lockdowns and economic recession may mean a hunger pandemic ahead for millions.”The executive director of the World Food Program, David Beasley, said there are two keys to averting the possibility of 265 million people being on the brink of famine by the end of the year: providing money and keeping supply chains running smoothly.The U.N. appeals to wealthy nations for funding all the time, he said, but the pandemic is “a one-time phenomena, a catastrophe we’re hitting,” so it’s not unreasonable to ask the wealthiest people and the wealthiest companies to give.“I don’t mean just a few million. I’m talking about hundreds of millions of dollars, billions,” Beasley said.He also urged action to address the “breakdown of supply chains globally.” Nations must ensure “that we don’t have export-import bans, restrictions at borders, shutdown of ports, shutdown of distribution points,” he said, saying that some countries have already imposed export bans that are having ripple effects on food supplies.As an example, Beasley said that if young people in urban areas in Africa lose their jobs as a result of the economic impact of the pandemic, they don’t have bank accounts to fall back on. “And if they don’t have food, you’re going to have protests, riots, unrest and destabilization. It’s going to cost the world a hundredfold more to react after the fact,” he warned.He said that if the world doesn’t respond with sufficient funding, it will be catastrophic.“We’re facing famine of biblical proportions,” he said. “We can avert famine if we act and we act now.”The U.N.’s initial $2 billion appeal has so far raised $1 billion, including a lot from Europe — Germany, Britain, the European Commission — with contributions also from Japan, Persian Gulf countries, Canada and others, Lowcock said.The updated appeal adds nine vulnerable countries to the 54 nations covered in the initial appeal — Benin, Djibouti, Liberia, Mozambique, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sierra Leone, Togo and Zimbabwe.Lowcock said more countries are being monitored for addition to the list amid “a very fast-moving situation.”U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi said in the briefing that there has not been a major outbreak of Covid-19 in refugee camps, but warned that they have an “extraordinary vulnerability” that needs prevention efforts.Dr. Mike Ryan, who heads the World Health Organization’s emergencies operation, said that people in such camps can’t maintain physical distance and they have “underlying vulnerabilities” with no access to personal hygiene, safe water, sanitation, food and welfare.“That is the tinder in which this epidemic may explode,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-appeals-for-6-7-billion-to-fight-virus-in-poor-countries/story-FABE1vPtQiP0JxUgLsFU1K.html
08-05-2020||World||Senators urge Trump to temporarily suspend H-1B, other guest worker visas||Top Republican senators urged US President Donald Trump on Thursday to suspend all new guest worker visas for 60 days and certain categories of new guest worker visas, including H-1B, for at least a year or until unemployment figures return to normal levels.The unemployment figures in the US have reached an all-time high due to the coronavirus pandemic. The letter has been signed by Senators Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton, Chuck Grassley and Josh Hawley.“As you know, more than 33 million Americans have filed for unemployment coverage just since mid-March, and approximately one-fifth of the American workforce is currently out of work. This is a stunning difference compared with the historically-low nationwide unemployment rate of just 3.5 per cent in February this year,” they said in their letter to the president.The letter, dated May 7, specifically calls for suspension of all non-immigrant guest worker visas for the next 60 days, followed by a continued suspension of certain categories of new non-immigrant guest worker visas for a year or until the national unemployment figures return to normal levels.“To protect unemployed Americans in the early stages of economic recovery, we urge you to suspend all non-immigrant guest worker visas for the next 60 days,” the senators said.Exceptions to this suspension should be rare, limited to time-sensitive industries such as agriculture and issued only on a case-by-case basis, when the employers can demonstrate that they have been unable to find Americans to take the jobs, the senators wrote.After 60 days, the senators urged Trump to continue to suspend new non-immigrant guest workers for a year or until the national unemployment figures return to normal levels, whichever comes first.“That suspension should, at a minimum, include H-2B visas (non-agricultural seasonal workers), H-1B visas (specialty occupation workers) and the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program (extension of foreign student visas after graduation). We also urge you to suspend the EB-5 immigrant visa program, effective immediately,” the lawmakers wrote.The H-1B work visa for foreign technology professionals is highly popular among Indians and a large number of Indians also opt for the EB-5 investors visa.The senators argued that there is no reason why unemployed Americans and recent college graduates should have to compete in such a limited job market against an influx of additional H-1B workers, most of whom work in business, technology or STEM fields.“Temporarily suspending the issuance of new H-1B visas would also protect the hundreds of thousands of H-1B workers and their families already working in the United States -- workers who could otherwise be subject to deportation if they are laid off for more than 60 days,” they said.“Of course, appropriate exceptions could also be crafted to the H-1B program suspension to allow for doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals who wish to come to the United States to assist in combating the coronavirus pandemic,” the senators wrote.Additionally, the United States ought to suspend its Optional Practical Training (OPT) programme, which allows foreign students in the country to extend their stay after graduation for one to three years to get “experience in the field” by taking jobs here, they wrote.In 2019, more than 223,000 former foreign students had their OPT applications approved or extended. While the merits of such a programme are subject to debate, there is certainly no reason to allow foreign students to stay for three additional years just to take jobs that would otherwise go to unemployed Americans as the country’s economy recovers, the lawmakers said.The senators also urged Trump to remove the EB-5 visa from the exemptions in his Presidential Proclamation issued on April 22, at least until real reforms are adopted.The EB-5 programme has long been plagued by scandal and fraud, and criticised as effectively functioning as a pay-for-citizenship scheme in many cases. There is no reason that the programme should receive preferential treatment as opposed to other green card programmes for employment-based immigrants, the lawmakers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senators-urge-trump-to-temporarily-suspend-h-1b-other-guest-worker-visas/story-v5h96zpxEwQwv8t33XDQnN.html

08-05-2020||World||Governors disregarding White House guidelines on Covid-19 lockdown reopening: Report||Many governors across the US are disregarding or creatively interpreting White House guidelines in easing their states’ lockdowns and letting businesses reopen, an Associated Press analysis found.The AP determined that 17 states do not appear to meet one of the key benchmarks set by the White House for loosening up — a 14-day downward trajectory in new cases or infection rates. And yet many of those have begun to reopen or are about to do so, including Alabama, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Utah.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBecause of the broad way in which the nonbinding guidelines are written, other states, including Georgia, have technically managed to meet the criteria and reopen despite not seeing a steady decline in cases and deaths.Asked at the White House on Thursday about states that are reopening without meeting some of the federal government’s benchmarks, President Donald Trump said: “The governors have great power as to that, given by us. We want them to do that. We rely on them. We trust them. And hopefully they are making the right decisions.”The push to reopen across the country comes amid pressure from businesses that are collapsing by the day and workers who have been thrown out of a job. Over 33 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits over the past seven weeks, and a highly anticipated report on Friday is expected to show US unemployment as high as 16%, a level not seen since the Depression.Elsewhere around the world, the Bank of England projected that Britain’s economy will shrink by 14 percent this year, its biggest decline since 1706, when Europe was embroiled in the War of the Spanish Succession.The economic woes have affected even brand-name businesses, with Neiman Marcus filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the first US department store chain to be toppled by the outbreak.The reopening debate in the US echoes that underway in Europe, where regional and political rifts are emerging over how fast to lift the lid on the lockdowns.French mayors are resisting the government’s call to reopen schools, while Italian governors want Rome to ease lockdown measures faster. As the British government looks to reopen the economy, Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon has warned that acting too fast could let the virus wreak havoc again.Public health experts around the world have cautioned that reopening too soon, without widespread testing and tracing, could enable the virus to come surging back with tragic consequences.The US has recorded over 74,000 deaths and 1.2 million confirmed infections. But this week, University of Washington researchers nearly doubled their projection of deaths in the US to about 134,000 through early August, largely to reflect the loosenings of stay-at-home restrictions.When Trump announced the guidelines April 16, he declared a “new front in our war” and said he was “establishing clear scientific metrics and benchmarks on testing, new case growth and hospital capacity that must be met before advancing each phase.”Since then, many states have reopened while daily cases and infection rates have either plateaued or continued to climb, the AP analysis found. Some states are going it alone, using their own criteria, not the White House’s.The White House has not been specific about how states should calculate the 14-day downward trajectory. Depending on how you calculate it, a state might pass or fail. The AP analyzed counts of tests and confirmed cases compiled by Johns Hopkins University and looked at the numbers using a rolling seven-day average to account for day-to-day variability in test reporting.As governments grapple with when to restart their economies, the Trump administration has shelved a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention document with step-by-step advice to local authorities on how and when to reopen restaurants and other public places.The 17-page report with detailed instructions on what precautions to take was supposed to be published last Friday, but agency scientists were told it “would never see the light of day,” according to a CDC official who was not authorized to discuss the matter and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican, has eased some rules to allow salons, tattoo parlors and restaurants to reopen with restrictions in most counties. Churches were allowed to resume in-person services, weddings and funerals on Monday, with some restrictions.But both new cases and the rate of positive test results have increased in Nebraska in recent weeks. Ricketts said Wednesday that the number of new cases is a poor indicator because it is naturally going to increase as the state ramps up testing.He suggested that the lockdown restrictions are too drastic. “We could ban just about all deaths on the interstate by reducing the speed to 5 mph, but we don’t do that,” he said.Georgia has embarked on the most aggressive reopening schedule in the country. It has met one of the White House criteria by recording a decrease in the rate of positive test results, but it has seen nearly 600 more deaths and a hot spot in a poultry-processing area since Gov. Brian Kemp moved to ease business restrictions.The head of Utah’s response, Maj. Gen. Jeff Burton, has implemented a color-coded reopening system that was in the works before the White House issued its guidelines.“We had that plan long before there was a federal plan,” Burton said. “It’s a solid plan that lays out the road to recovery.”Among other things the White House guidelines say that before reopening, states should have a downward trend in flu and COVID-19-like illnesses for 14 days; hospitals should be able to treat all patients without crisis care; and robust testing should be in place for at-risk health workers.But there are few specifics, and the plan says local officials “may need to tailor the application of these criteria to local circumstances.”Of the 33 states that have had a 14-day downward trajectory of either cases or positivity rates, 25 are partially opened or moving to reopen within days, the AP analysis finds.Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Virginia and Wisconsin, which have not seen a 14-day decline in cases or rates of positive tests, remain closed despite meeting some other benchmarks.Many governors are focusing on the criteria that call for a reduction in the percentage of positive tests for COVID-19. Up to now, many states have been doing limited testing, typically on their sickest residents. The percentage of people testing positive has dropped as testing expanded to the broader population in recent weeks.Public health experts say the guidance from the top has been anything but clear. In addition to burying the CDC report, the Trump administration has tried to push responsibility for expanding testing capacity onto the states.“We’re a federalist society, so some of the blame goes to the governors and some of the blame goes to the president. But the responsibility for coordinating and enforcing and implementing a national plan comes from the White House,” said Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University.He likened it to “an orchestra without a conductor.”Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 3.8 million people and killed over a quarter-million, by Johns Hopkins’ count, which experts agree understates the dimensions of the pandemic because of limited testing, differences in counting the dead and concealment by some governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/governors-disregarding-white-house-guidelines-on-covid-19-lockdown-reopening-report/story-3x1gvo7E0AJW7Eg4Kf12OP.html
08-05-2020||World||UK PM calls for wartime spirit to beat virus in VE Day letter to vets||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday compared Britain’s battle with coronavirus to the country’s fight against Nazism in World War II, in a letter to veterans to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day.Johnson, who was hospitalised last month with Covid-19, told veterans they were “quite simply the greatest generation of Britons who ever lived” and that they would never be forgotten.“On this anniversary, we are engaged in a new struggle against the coronavirus which demands the same spirit of national endeavour that you exemplified 75 years ago,” he said in the letter.“We cannot pay our tribute with the parades and street celebrations we enjoyed in the past; your loved ones may be unable to visit in person.“But please allow us, your proud compatriots, to be the first to offer our gratitude, our heartfelt thanks and our solemn pledge: you will always be remembered.”The UK government changed its early May public holiday -- usually held on the first Monday of the month -- to Friday to allow people to mark the 75th anniversary of the 1945 Victory in Europe celebrations.But a nationwide lockdown introduced in late March to curb the coronavirus pandemic and which remains in place scuppered plans for street parties and veterans parades.With more than 30,000 dead, more people in Britain have lost their lives as a result of the outbreak than any other country in Europe and Johnson on Thursday told ministers the government must ease restrictions with “maximum caution”.He is expected to address the nation on Sunday evening to set out a roadmap for lifting the lockdown over the coming months.Meanwhile Britons have been urged to join a national singalong from their doorsteps -- of Vera Lynn’s wartime classic “We’ll Meet Again” -- and to hold 1940s-style tea parties at home to mark VE Day.Queen Elizabeth II will make a televised address to the nation later on Friday to mark the day the Nazis surrendered, bringing an end to World War II in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-calls-for-wartime-spirit-to-beat-virus-in-ve-day-letter-to-vets/story-pmLUltKvI8dSFpl3Q3twjN.html

08-05-2020||World||US jobless numbers rise by another 3.2 million amid Covid-19 pandemic||Nearly 3.2 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, which reflected a continued drop from the peak in April but was still a record, taking up the total of job losses caused by the Covid-19 epidemic in the United States to 33.5 million, according to new data released Thursday.Before March, when the epidemic which President Donald Trump has said has been the “worst attack” in US history, worse than the 1942 Pearl Harbor attack and the September 11 terrorist attacks got under way, the number of claims for unemployment benefits had been historically 700,000 a week, going back several decades.Though 3.2 million marked continued reduction following 3.8 million the week before and way below the peak of 6.9 million applications filed in late March. The cumulative figure for the past month due Friday are expected to be far grimmer, wiping out job gains of several decades.Layoffs started mid-March as the country began to be shut down state by state to enforce social-distancing and other mitigation efforts to combat the coronavirus epidemic. Restaurants, theatres, shopping mall, saloon closed, manufacturing slowed and travel and hospitality industry were crippled.The epidemic’s devastating impact on the economy is telling on families. New research released Wednesday by the Hamilton Project showed unprecedented levels of food insecurity in the United States. One in five children are not getting enough to eat, was one of the grim findings of the study.At least 42 states have opened up or eased restriction to varying degrees in recent days. But the Wall Street Journal said citing economists that it will be months before US employers begin hiring consistently again and years before the millions of jobs lost thus far will be fully replaced.President Trump, who has cheered on the reopening, expressed growing frustration with the havoc wreaked by the epidemic, and called it the “worst attack” in US history.“This is worse than Pearl Harbor. This is worse than the World Trade Center,” the president told reporters, referring to two pivotal events n US history. The Pearl Harbor attack in 1942 drew the United States into the Second World War and the 9/11 attacks triggered the longest in US history, in Afghanistan. — more people had died in either instance, than the toll from Covid-19 thus far.US toll shot up by 2,367 deaths in the last 24 hours, marking a return to more than 2,000 after days of dipping numbers, to 73,435; and by 24,254 new infections to 1.22 million infections. While the daily toll had ebbed in recent days, the number of infections has hovered around and above 20,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-numbers-rise-by-another-3-2-million-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-Cj93jgUSUtQmIcoGwS4r6M.html
08-05-2020||World||WHO cautions against use of Madagascar anti-virus potion||The World Health Organization on Thursday advised governments to clinically test a herbal drink touted by Madagascar’s President Andry Rajoelina as a remedy against coronavirus. The Covid-Organics infusion is derived from artemisia -- a plant with proven anti-malarial properties -- and other indigenous herbs.Rajoelina hopes to distribute the infusion across West Africa and beyond, claiming it cures COVID-19 patients within 10 days.Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Niger have already received consignments of the potion. Others such as Tanzania have expressed interest.But the World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly warned that there are no published scientific studies of the herbal tea and that its effects have not been tested.“We would caution and advise countries against adopting a product that has not been taken through tests to see its efficacy,” WHO Africa Director Matshidiso Moeti said in a press briefing on Thursday, calling on Madagascar to take the drink “through a clinical trial”.Moeti said that in 2000, African governments had committed to taking “traditional therapies” through the same clinical trials as other medication.“I can understand the need, the drive to find something that can help,” Moeti said. “But we would very much like to encourage this scientific process in which the governments themselves made a commitment.”South Africa’s Health Minister Zweli Mkhize on Wednesday said Madagascar had reached out for “help” with scientific research.“Our scientists would be able to assist with this research,” Mkhize tweeted, adding that South Africa would only “get involved in a scientific analysis of the herb”.The country has the highest number of coronavirus cases in sub-Saharan Africa, with 7,808 infections and 153 fatalities recorded to date.Neighbouring eSwatini -- a tiny landlocked nation wedged between South Africa and Mozambique -- said it would not consider Rajoelina’s tonic for the time being.“It is important as a country to first ascertain where such herbal products have been tested,” she said Health Minister Lizzie Nkosi on Thursday. “We have to do adequate proper research and be sure that the product works.”To date eSwatini has reported 123 cases of coronavirus, including two deaths.Meanwhile, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has debunked claims that it had ordered a package of Covid-Organics from a “third country”.“We are aware that several claims of a COVID-19 cure have been made in different parts of the world,” ECOWAS said in a statement on Wednesday.“But we can only support and endorse products that have been shown to be effective through scientific study.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-cautions-against-use-of-madagascar-anti-virus-potion/story-oAcsFtSTJR1rYDU74TxUzJ.html
