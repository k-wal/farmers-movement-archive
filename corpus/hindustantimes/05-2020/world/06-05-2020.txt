This new strain, which is sweeping through the United States, can have implications for the hunt for a vaccine.It spread first in Europe and then to the United States and Canada and has been dominant strain globally since March, researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in a 33-page paper in BioRxiv, a scientific journal that publishes pre-peer reviewed papers.If it does not subside in summer, it could further mutate and could potentially be less effective to vaccines that are being developed, the researchers said.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverage“This is hard news,” Bette Korber, a computational biologist at Los Alamos and lead author of the study wrote on her Facebook page, as reported by the Los Angeles Times.“But please don’t only be disheartened by it,” she went on. “Our team at LANL was able to document this mutation and its impact on transmission only because of a massive global effort of clinical people and experimental groups, who make new sequences of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) in their local communities available as quickly as they possibly can.”Upwards of 90 separate efforts are underway in the United States to find a vaccine as the epidemic continues to rage across the country.It has killed 71,152 people in the United States so far, up by 1,240 in the last 24 hours and infected 1.2 million with 22,335 infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mutant-coronavirus-more-contagious-says-study/story-yfT41XVnyAmDGiTmscUqvN.html

06-05-2020||World||Donald Trump reverses himself, will keep task-force ‘indefinitely’||President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he intends to continue the coronavirus task force “indefinitely”, reversing his earlier plans to wind it down. He will repurpose it, however, to focus on “safety and reopening” and “vaccines and therapeutics”.Less than 12 hours ago, the president had told reporters at a mask-making factory in Arizona that the task force, which is spearheading the federal response to the outbreak, has done a good job thus far but he wants to replace it with “something different” for Phase Two, the reopening of the country.The flip-flop was was seen as a reflection of the administration’s continued struggle to come to grips with the public health and economic crisis unleashed by the virus. New accounts have emerged through two whistleblower complaints revealed Tuesday how the administration botched the shortage of medical supplies and focussed on unproven treatments such as the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine.The task-force has done a “fantastic job of bringing together vast highly complex resources”, the president said in a bunch of tweets Wednesday and it will continue “indefinitely with its focus on SAFETY & OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN … and will also be very focused on Vaccines & Therapeutics”. He may “add or subtract people”.This was in stark contrast of his intention as he conveyed to reporters Tuesday. The task force has “done a great job”, he said as he toured a mask-making factory in Arizona, adding, “but we’re now looking at a little bit of a different form, and that form is safety and ope. He indicated a “different group” could be set up for what he has said will be “Phase Two”.“You could say there might be a recurrence, and there might be,” he replied to a question about the timing of his plans to disband the task force when experts were warning of recurrence and a surge in numbers. But he said the country will be better prepared for it because “we have learnt a lot about the coronavirus.”But he reassured reporters he will continue to consult with the doctors and experts of the task-force, such as Deborah Birx, the coordinator, and Anthony Fauci, the top epidemiologist who has not hesitated to disagree with the president publicly on everything from treatments and reopening.The American president is in a hurry to reopen the country and seek to reverse the economic downturn unleashed by the virus, with over 30 million jobless, with an eye on his re-election prospects. He has dismissed warnings of resurgences caused by hurried and premature opening.A public model widely cited by the White House and regarded by the broader public health community has projected deaths could double to more than134,000 by August because of the easing of restrictions underway in many states — 42 at last count — from the current toll of over over 71,000.“They want to proclaim it over,” New York Andrew Cuomo said on CNN Tuesday about the president’s plans for the task force.“They have been looking to proclaim it over from day one right?…That is clear. But the virus doesn’t care…doesn’t listen. This is not a marketing situation”Accounts of the Trump administration’s mishandling of the federal response to the outbreak have continued to pile up, in the meantime. New allegations are about the administration’s focus on questionable treatments for Covid-19 such as the se of antimalarial hydroxychloroquine and on the botched response to the shortage of essential supplies such as protective gears and ventilators.Rick Bright, a senior official in the department of health and human services, has alleged in a whistleblower complaint, his warnings about the outbreak made as early as January had been ignored. And once it had hit the US with full force, he was alarmed about the pressure brought on by senior officials to “invest in drugs, vaccines, and other technologies without proper scientific vetting or that lacked scientific merit”.He went on to allege he was so alarmed that he shared with a reporter nonclassified emails between government official about hydroxychloroquine in which they had “discussed the drug’s potential toxicity and demonstrated the political pressure to rush these drugs from Pakistan and India to American households”. Bright claimed he was transferred out shortly after the publication of a news article about the drug.Another whistleblower complaint, also reported Tuesday, details how a group of young, inexperienced volunteers from business consultancy firms and private equity funds pulled together by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior advisor, had grossly mismanaged the acquisition of essential supplies such as masks and ventilators, further complicating shortages in the initial weeks of the epidemic in the united States. They had also prioritized the distribution of supplies to serve people who knew the president or claimed to be close to him..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-reverses-himself-will-keep-task-force-indefinitely/story-oE6rC9fB4IUgmJhswZPZ9J.html
06-05-2020||World||Labour leader Keir Starmer in a bind over ‘repositioning’ India policy||Labour leader Keir Starmer has come under fire for what is seen as ‘repositioning’ its policy on Jammu and Kashmir, which previously had an overtly international and human rights-based focus, but has moved in his bid to rebuild trust with India and the Indian community in the UK.Buffeted by competing demands and claims by the pro-India and pro-Pakistan lobbies in the party, Starmer, who took over from Jeremy Corbyn in April, has been gradually distancing the party from the ‘Corbyn era’, which was seen in sections of the community as being anti-India.Several Labour MPs – particularly those leading pro-Kashmir interests such as Debbie Abrahams, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Kashmir, who was deported from India in February after Indian officials said she was travelling on a wrong (business) visa that was cancelled – are due to meet Starmer on Thursday to discuss the ‘repositioning’ that sees the Jammu and Kashmir. Several individuals and groups have angrily asked him to reconsider the new approach.There were ripples and more in London and the UK when New Delhi made fundamental changes in the status of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019, leading to violence outside the Indian high commission and anger in sections of the Indian community against Labour. The ministry of external affairs had rejected a Labour party resolution seen as ‘anti-India.’Starmer last week set out the ‘repositioning’ in a statement with the Labour Friends of India, a lobby group in the party. His focus on building “even stronger business links with India” and conception of the Jammu and Kashmir issue is seen by his critics as betraying human rights values.Starmer said in the statement: “We must not allow issues of the sub-continent to divide communities here. Any constitutional issues in India are a matter for the Indian Parliament and Kashmir is a bilateral issue for India and Pakistan to resolve peacefully. Labour is an internationalist Party and stands for the defence of human rights everywhere”.“A Labour Government under my leadership will be determined to build even stronger business links with India and to co-operate on the global stage on issues such as climate change. I look forward to meeting the Indian high commissioner in due course to open a renewed dialogue between the Labour Party and the people of India,” he added.The Pakistani community in the UK has largely stood by Labour even as large sections of the Indian community have gravitated towards the Conservatives in recent elections. It remains to be seen how the Pakistani community responds politically to Starmer’s perceived pro-India stance, since moving to the Conservatives or the Liberal Democrats is not exactly an option.Starmer wrote to the Hindu Forum of Britain (HFB) last week and made similar points, further riling his critics such as the South Asia Solidarity Group, Momentum Internationalists. The HFB had raised issues such as “caste legislation, anti-India stance and Hinduphobia” in the Labour party.Indian circles remain cautiously optimistic on Starmer’s overtures, viewing his statements as a bid to move on from the Corbyn era, but keenly observing how he deals with the challenge of retaining support of the Pakistani community, which closely identifies with issues related to Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/labour-leader-keir-starmer-in-a-bind-over-repositioning-india-policy/story-MArxgUppN5bo1yAzk2UeaM.html
06-05-2020||World||Asian Development Bank, Pakistan finalise $305 million emergency Covid loan||The ADB and cash-strapped Pakistan have finalised a USD 305 million emergency Covid-19 loan to help the country buy medical equipment and disburse money to poor women, according to a media report on Wednesday. The Asian Development Bank will extend the loan on commercial terms, The Express Tribune reported. Last month, Pakistan had received an emergency loan of USD 1.39 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and an aid of USD 200 million from the World Bank (WB). While the IMF loan was to boost Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, the WB aid focused on supporting preparedness and emergency response in the health sector. Explaining the need for the ADB loan, Pakistan’s Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Jahanzeb Khan told The Express Tribune that the government was looking at ways to assist those who were directly hit by the virus but could not till now apply for financial help. Pakistan had sent the official loan request to the ADB in March. The USD 305 million package will be combined under the Pakistan National Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (NEPRP) for Covid-19 which is under the Planning Commission. The NEPRP is worth USD 588 million, which includes a USD 238 million World Bank loan. Out of the USD 305 million loan, USD 200 million is for social protection for vulnerable sections -- cash transfers and unconditional cash transfer instalments -- and USD 105 million for health emergencies like maintaining stores. The novel coronavirus which first surfaced in China’s Wuhan city has claimed over 250,000 lives and infected 3.6 million people across the world. In Pakistan, the virus has killed 526 people with 22,413 confirmed infections. The virus has also adversely hit the country’s economy. On Tuesday, Pakistan requested the members of G-20 nations for debt relief with a commitment of not contracting new non-concessional loans except those allowed under the IMF and World Bank guidelines. The country’s foreign currency reserves had dropped to a four-month low at USD 10.97 billion on April 10, 2020. The reserves had partly depleted due to capital pullout worth around USD 2.69 billion by short-term foreign investors from Pakistan’s debt market over the past five to six weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asian-development-bank-pakistan-finalise-305-million-emergency-covid-loan/story-2l9cxXIiIhiEWsDdzGxPCO.html

How did it allow the outbreak to develop to the stage today? Is this how a government should be responsible to its people?” she asked.Responding to a question, Hua said as of May 1, China has provided more than 5.3 billion masks, 330 million pairs of surgical gloves, 38.85 million pieces of protective clothing, 5.98 million pairs of goggles, and nearly 7,500 ventilators to the US.“Therefore, the claims about China’s so-called concealment of epidemic situation, delay of notification, and profit from epidemic situation are purely nonsense…,” Hua added.“The most urgent task is to control the outbreak in the U.S. and to save as many lives as possible ... Saving lives should take precedence over political self-interest,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-should-not-weaponise-trade-tariffs-says-china/story-NtWKF6o6thViGSMACauhwK.html
06-05-2020||World||Most US H-1B employers use programme to pay migrants below market wages: Report||A majority of the US H-1B employers, including tech giants like Facebook, Google, Apple and Microsoft, use the temporary work visa programme to pay the migrant workers well below market wages, a new report has claimed.The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers from countries like India and China in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.Nearly 500,000 migrant workers are employed in the US in the H-1B status.“Among the top 30 H-1B employers are major US firms including Amazon, Microsoft, Walmart, Google, Apple and Facebook. All of them take advantage of program rules in order to legally pay many of their H-1B workers below the local median wage for the jobs they fill,” said the report released by the Economic Policy Institute.Authored by Daniel Costa and Ron Hira, the report titled “H-1B visas and prevailing wage levels” says 60 per cent of H-1B positions certified by the US Department of Labor (DOL) are assigned wage levels well below the local median wage for the occupation.While the H-1B programme rules allow this, the DOL has the authority to change it, but has not, it said. While over 53,000 employers used the H-1B programme in 2019, the top 30 H-1B employers accounted for more than one in four of all 389,000 H-1B petitions approved by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2019, it said.Half of the top 30 H-1B employers use an outsourcing business model to provide staff for third-party clients, rather than employing H-1B workers directly to fill a special need at the company that applies for the visa, the report said.The report alleged that major US-based technology firms that hire H-1B workers directly, rather than contract them out to third-party employers, had significant shares of their certified H-1B positions assigned as Level 1 or Level 2, the two lowest wage levels in fiscal 2019, both of which are below the local median wage.“Until now, much of the public discourse and proposals for reforming H-1B have focused on rules that would constrain the practices of these outsourcing companies,” the report said.But researches reveal that many firms that employ H-1B workers directly, including some of the biggest names in the technology industry such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Qualcomm, Salesforce and Uber, pay a large share of their H-1B workers at one of the two lowest wage levels, Level 1 or Level 2.In addition, these direct-hire firms also hire many H-1B workers on a contract basis through outsourcing firms, it added.Microsoft, the seventh-largest H-1B employer in 2019, assigned one-third (35 per cent) of its positions on Labor Condition Applications (LCAs) as Level 1 and two-fifths (42 per cent) as Level 2. In total, Microsoft assigned more than three-quarters (77 per cent) of its H-1B positions as Level 1 or Level 2, a wage level below the local median wage.Microsoft assigned only 18 per cent of its positions as Level 3 (the median) wage, and a mere three per cent as Level 4, the only above-median wage level.Amazon, which appears twice in the H-1B top 30, as “Amazon.com Services” (no. 4 among the biggest H-1B employers) and “Amazon Web Services” (no. 27), also assigned the vast majority of its H-1B positions at one of the two lowest wage levels.According to the report, Amazon.com Services assigned 34 per cent of its H-1B positions as Level 1 and 51 per cent as Level 2, for a total of 86 per cent of all positions certified.Amazon Web Services assigned 47 per cent of its H-1B workers as Level 1 and 36 per cent as Level 2. Combined, Amazon.com Services and Amazon Web Services had 12,428 positions certified at Level 1 or 2, for a total of 85 per cent certified at a wage level below the median. Only one in eight (1,684) were certified at or above the 50th percentile (Level 3 or Level 4), it said.Apple, eleventh on the list, assigned 558 of its H-1B positions (two per cent) as Level 1 and one-third (32 per cent) as Level 2, for a combined total of 34 per cent at Levels 1 and 2. Apple assigned 32 per cent as Level 3 and 34 per cent as Level 4.Google, ranked the fifth-largest H-1B employer, had 9,085 H-1B positions certified by the DOL in fiscal 2019. It assigned less than half of one per cent of its certified H-1B jobs as Level 1 and 54 per cent as Level 2. Only 37 per cent of Google’s jobs were certified at or above the median wage, the report said.Facebook assigned only one position as Level 1 and 10 per cent of its 6,118 total H-1B positions as Level 2. Twenty-five per cent were certified at Level 3 and 16 per cent at Level 4. Nearly half (49 per cent) of Facebook’s H-1B positions were certified at a wage established by an alternative wage survey, making it difficult to assess its H-1B wage distribution, it said.Uber, the 29th-ranked H-1B employer in 2019, had 5,708 H-1B positions certified by the DOL. Less than one per cent was assigned as Level 1 and just over half (53 per cent) as Level 2. Just over one-third were assigned as Level 3 and 13 per cent as Level 4.While Uber had 5,708 H-1B positions certified by DOL and hired 1,160 H-1B workers in 2019, in the same year, it made headlines by laying off 400 employees.The report claims that the top 30 H-1B employers are in fact hiring H-1B workers to fill a very large number of routine (Levels 1 and 2) positions that require relatively little experience and ordinary skills.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-us-h-1b-employers-use-programme-to-pay-migrants-below-market-wages-report/story-6vzTqoGjIi6bp53r98hxFO.html

Catherine Calderwood, chief medical officer of Scotland, had resigned in April after it was revealed she visited her second home during the lockdown.Ferguson was a member of the influential Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, which has been meeting daily and contributing to the government response to the coronavirus pandemic. The police have been given new powers to enforce lockdown curbs.Health secretary Matt Hancock said Ferguson had made the right decision to resign, adding he would support police action against the expert. According to him, flouting the lockdown rules by Ferguson was “extraordinary,” and left him “speechless”.“Prof Ferguson is a very, very eminent and impressive scientist and the science he’s done has been an important part of what we’ve listened to, and I think he took the right decision to resign,” Hancock said.Johnson faced Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons for the first time after recovering from coronavirus on Wednesday, when Labour leader Keir Starmer subjected him to forensic questioning.Starmer alleged that the government had been slow to lockdown, slow to test, slow to trace and slow on providing personal protection equipment, which led to the UK registering the worst death toll in Europe.Johnson acknowledged that the capacity to test in initial stages was limited: “It’s easier to do now on the way out than it was as the epidemic took off. And I think most people with common sense can see the particular problems we had at the time.” He set a new target of 200,000 tests a day by the end of May.Meanwhile, chancellor Rishi Sunak indicated that the wage-subsidy scheme to pay 80 per cent of furloughed staff up to a limit of 2,500 pounds per month from March to June is likely to be wound down as part of plans to remove lockdown measures.As the number of UK jobless due to the pandemic grew, Johnson told MPs he would announce plans to gradually ease lockdown measures on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-uk-govt-advisor-flouts-covid-19-lockdown-rules-quits/story-6ntIL3iMsBNSr0fsU2qewO.html

That was the second attack on a minority group claimed by Islamic State in a month after more than 30 people were shot dead in a gathering attended by many members of the ethnic Hazara community marking the anniversary of the death of a Hazara leader.Also in March, attackers fired rockets at Ghani’s inauguration ceremony and in April sent rockets into the Bagram airbase, though no one was killed in either attack.The violence underscored the challenges to securing lasting peace in Afghanistan even after the United States signed a troop withdrawal agreement with the militant Taliban in February. The Islamist group has since held off on large-scale attacks on foreign forces or in major centres, though it has continued attacking Afghan security forces throughout the provinces.Islamic State, which is not a party to the agreement and has fought the Taliban in the past, has a small presence in Afghanistan, largely in the north, though it has waged high profile attacks further south in the capital.The militant Haqqani network, founded in the 1970s, is one of the most powerful and feared groups in the Afghan insurgency and has in the past had links to the Taliban.

The United States, which exited the deal in 2018, says it wants to extend the embargo.In a speech on Wednesday, Rouhani repeated Iran’s longstanding criticism of Washington’s decision to exit the nuclear deal, which he called a “stupid mistake”.“If America wants to return to the deal, it should lift all the sanctions on Tehran and compensate for the reimposition of sanctions,” said Rouhani, a pragmatist whose rhetoric towards the United States is frequently more measured than that of some officials. “Iran will give a crushing response if the arms embargo on Tehran is extended,” Rouhani added. Iran has gradually rolled back its commitments under the accord in response to the U.S. decision to quit, but says it wants the agreement to remain in place. It has criticised European parties to the deal for failing to salvage the pact by shielding its economy from U.S. sanctions.“Iran’s nuclear steps are reversible if other parties to the deal fulfil their obligations and preserve Tehran’s interests under the pact,” Rouhani said.

Whether it was Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin or Saddam Hussein, these rulers made the world tremble in fear.Same is the case with Kim Jong Un, who rules North Korea. The entire international media was abuzz with the news of his extremely poor health in recent days after reportedly undergoing a heart surgery. Some media outlets, especially those in the South Korea, even claimed that Kim won’t survive.But days later, the North Korean media released photographs of the leader at a ribbon-cutting ceremony, which the media said was held during the inauguration of a fertiliser plant.Kim looked in a jovial mood in those pictures; he was even smiling. And since then, several theories emerged on the internet about his health.One such theory, picked up by British publication Daily Mail, claims that Kim used a body double at the May 1 ceremony. It posted several photographs of the 36-year-old leader doing the rounds on the internet to describe how his facial features looked different.The most notable difference highlighted in those photographs are in his dentition. The teeth looked doctored, the Daily Mail report claimed.Lending credence to the theory is former Tory MP Louise Mensch. “No it isn’t. Teeth, Cupid’s bow, others. Totally different. Look at those gnashes, if you must,” she said in her tweet posted on May 2. No it isn’t. Teeth, Cupid’s bow, others. Totally different.

Johnson is expected to set out a plan for exiting the lockdown on Sunday. The first phase will involve small shops reopening alongside outdoor workplaces and the second will involve large shopping centres reopening, with more people encouraged to go into work, The Times said.Pubs, restaurants, hotels and leisure centres will be among the last to open, the newspaper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-has-drawn-up-3-stage-plan-for-easing-covid-lockdown-report/story-wWFTVNXw5Ol8QhQupVfMrK.html
06-05-2020||World||All you need to know about the Wuhan lab at the heart of the US-China virus spat||The Chinese laboratory accused by top American officials of being the source of the coronavirus pandemic conducts research on the world’s most dangerous diseases.US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have both claimed that there is evidence the pathogen came from the lab in Wuhan -- the city where the disease was first detected late last year.But the World Health Organization said Washington had offered no evidence to support the “speculative” claims, and scientists believe the coronavirus jumped from animals to humans, possibly at a Wuhan market selling wild animals.The top US epidemiologist Anthony Fauci has echoed the WHO’s statement, telling National Geographic that all evidence so far “strongly indicates” a natural origin.China has strongly denied the allegations, but speculation and conspiracy theories have persisted.Here are some key questions about the Wuhan Institute of Virology:What do its researchers do?Work by the lab’s scientists helped to shed light on the COVID-19 pathogen in the early days of the outbreak in Wuhan.In February, they published work concluding that the new virus shared a 79.6 percent sequence identity to the SARS coronavirus, and that it was 96 percent identical at the whole-genome level to a coronavirus found in bats.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe lab’s researchers had already conducted extensive investigations on the links between bats and disease outbreaks in China, and had highlighted the need to prepare for viruses potentially spreading out of their natural reservoirs into human communities.Scientists think COVID-19 originated in bats and could have been transmitted to people via another mammal like a pangolin, but there is no definitive answer so far.What does it handle? The Wuhan institute houses the largest virus bank in Asia which preserves more than 1,500 strains.The complex contains Asia’s first maximum-security lab equipped to handle Class 4 pathogens (P4) such as Ebola.The 300-million-yuan ($42 million) P4 lab opened in 2018. A P3 lab has been in operation since 2012.While the US intelligence community said it had concluded the coronavirus was not human-made, it added that it would continue to investigate if the outbreak started from contact with infected animals or from “an accident” at the Wuhan lab.Could there be a leak? US diplomatic cables seen by The Washington Post earlier said that officials were concerned about inadequate safety standards related to researchers’ handling of SARS-like bat coronaviruses in the high-security lab.The institute has said it received samples of the then-unknown virus on December 30, determined the viral genome sequence on January 2 and submitted information on the pathogen to the WHO on January 11.Shi Zhengli, one of China’s leading experts on bat coronaviruses and deputy director of the Wuhan P4 lab, said she would “bet her life that (the new coronavirus) had nothing to do with the lab”, according to Chinese state media.And in an interview with Scientific American, Shi said the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence did not match any of the bat coronaviruses her laboratory had previously collected and studied.What do scientists know about the virus? Researchers have noted that while there is no proof for the lab accident theory, there is also no clear evidence that the virus came from the Wuhan market.A study by a group of Chinese scientists published in The Lancet in January found that the first COVID-19 patient had no connection to the market, and neither did 13 of the first 41 confirmed cases.Professor Leo Poon of The University of Hong Kong said the scientific community’s consensus was that the virus is not human-made.“We need to look at the origin of this virus. It is important, because from a public health point of view, we want to know how it happened, and (if we can) learn from this,” he said.David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, added: “We have a hypothesis that it came from a live animal market, and I haven’t seen anybody provide evidence that shows to the contrary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-wuhan-lab-at-the-heart-of-the-us-china-virus-spat/story-FUamWGJlBmyp5IjJ6k5wrL.html

More than 2.5 lakh people have died due to Covid-19 globally while over one million have recovered from the disease.The United States, Spain, Italy, France, the UK are some of the top affected countries in the world. The United States has reported over one million Covid-19 cases so far while Europe remains the worst-hit continent. Here are the key coronavirus updates from the globe:1. After his hospitalisation for Covid-19, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will make his first appearance in parliament on Wednesday.2. Russia recorded over 10,000 new coronavirus cases for the fourth day in a row on Wednesday. The country has the sixth-highest number of confirmed Covid-19 infections in the world with around 165,929 people infected from the virus.3. The United Kingdom has overtaken Italy to report the highest official death toll from coronavirus disease Covid-19 in Europe, second in the world after the United States.4. US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that as the country takes steps to reopen economy, more Americans will die of Covid-19. “It’s possible there will be some... because you won’t be locked into an apartment or a house or whatever it is,” he said.5. The United Kingdom has drawn up a three-stage plan to ease the coronavirus lockdown that is being in place since March, The Times newspaper reported. The first stage will see small shops opening up. Large stores will open up in the second state and restaurants, hotels leisure centres, among other centres of large public gatherings, will be last to open up, news agency Reuters reported. 6. India stands at the 10th spot on the global tally of ‘active’ Covid-19 cases with 33,514 active coronavirus patients in the country. active Covid-19 cases are the number of total coronavirus cases after deducting the recovered/discharged patients and number of fatalities.7. China said, if needed, it will expand its funding to support the United Nations in developing vaccines and treatment for Covid-19. Reuters reported.8. US Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday that the Trump administration has initiated talks on winding down the White House Task Force on coronavirus.9. As states move to lift lockdowns in the US, figures Covid-19 infection rate is rising outside New York. As per the data by Johns Hopkins University, daily new confirmed coronavirus cases in the US exceed 20,000, and deaths per day are well over 1,000.10.

President Vladimir Putin was set to chair a government meeting to discuss a gradual withdrawal from virus lockdown later on Wednesday.Moscow, which has emerged as the epicentre of the pandemic in Russia, has recorded 85,973 cases and 866 deaths.Despite the sharp rise in cases, Russia’s official fatality rate has remained low in comparison to countries including Italy, Spain and the United States.Officials credit quick moves to close the country’s borders, as well as widespread testing and tracking of infections, but critics have cast doubt on the numbers.as/mm/txw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-sees-over-10-000-new-covid-19-cases-for-fourth-day-in-row/story-4ydLq7FBtJEcu1vuktbK4I.html
06-05-2020||World||Rishi Sunak to look at all options to bring UK furlough support to end||Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is examining ways to move millions of workers off government support and back into their jobs as the U.K. leaves its lockdown.In March, as the U.K. went into lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus, Sunak announced a furlough program where workers received 80% of their wage to stay home.It’s now supporting more than 6.3 million people at a cost of billions of pounds, and the chancellor has to find a way to ease them off it. Amid the debate about how to wind down aid, the British Chambers of Commerce said Wednesday that most U.K. businesses could be up and running days after restrictions are lifted, with smaller firms primed to return the quickest.A government official said Sunak was working through policy options this week, with no decisions taken and everything still on the table.Options reported in newspapers include reducing the subsidy to 60%, to encourage people to go back to work, and allowing people to work while receiving a smaller subsidy, possibly as a way of helping businesses restart slowly.Getting the exit from the plan right is crucial if the U.K. is to avoid worsening an already perilous employment situation. The Resolution Foundation warned Wednesday that the crisis could see youth unemployment spike by 600,000 this year, taking it above 1 million.Expensive SupportThe government support for jobs is expected to cost 39 billion pounds ($48 billion). If it runs too long, it will cost more. But if Sunak ends it too abruptly, businesses short of money may have to lay off staff, negating the point of the program.More than 800,000 employers are using the program, and he has promised there will be no cliff edge end to the support. BCC Director General Adam Marshall echoed that sentiment in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday.“Firms are going to have to have access to it for some time to come because not every business can open at the same pace,” he said. “We caution against just breaking it down by sector because if you withdrew support from some firms that are in the supply chains of these businesses but kept support to others, you could see some supply chains collapse.”According to the BCC survey, almost two-thirds of companies with fewer than 10 employees and half of large businesses said they could be ready within a week.The poll, conducted April 29-May 1 found, suggests commerce could ramp up fairly quickly following the lifting of the lockdown, although questions remain about how businesses will be impacted by continued social distancing rules.The timing of any easing is still uncertain. A decision on whether to extend the lockdown is due this week, with every indication that Prime Minister Boris Johnson will say the closures of schools and most shops needs to continue. But he is likely to set out a pathway back to normality, once scientists are sure that coronavirus can be kept under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-to-look-at-all-options-to-bring-uk-furlough-support-to-end/story-pEzTyeX4zTVQ6O8SYD05DJ.html
06-05-2020||World||UK now has second-highest Covid-19 toll after United States, data shows||The United Kingdom has overtaken Italy to report the highest official death toll from coronavirus disease Covid-19 in Europe, figures released on Tuesday showed.Weekly figures from Britain’s Office for National Statistics (ONS) added more than 7,000 deaths in England and Wales in the week to April 24, raising the total for the United Kingdom to 32,313. Italy said on Tuesday that it has recorded 29,316 virus fatalities to date.Only the United States, with a population nearly five times greater, has suffered more confirmed fatalities from the virus than Britain, according to the data so far. Nearly 69,000 have died in the pandemic there.Italy and Spain, the next worst-hit European countries, have smaller populations than Britain, further complicating comparisons.“Putting a graph out with the United States at the top and UK second is not helpful, but once you start to break it down by looking at the population we should be seriously asking questions about what’s different,” Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at Oxford University, told news agency Reuters.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged against trying to make reliable international comparisons.“There are different ways of counting deaths... we now publish data that includes all deaths in all settings and not all countries do that,” he said at the daily Downing Street press conference.“Can you reliably know that all countries are measuring in the same way? And it also depends on how good, frankly, countries are in gathering their statistics.”Tuesday’s updated statistics means Britain has probably had the highest official death numbers in Europe for days.But the weekly ONS data also shows that the peak in Covid-19 deaths has likely passed, although the week to April 24 was still the second-deadliest since comparable records began being kept in 1993.Britain, in its seventh week of an economically crippling lockdown, is trying to implement a new contact tracing strategy so it can ease the measures.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out his plan to lift the stringent social distancing regime next Sunday, according to media reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-now-has-second-highest-covid-19-toll-after-united-states-data-shows/story-rGlVOptjpfg3daLqCDOXcO.html

Officials there say it has created a gap in the global fight against the coronavirus and threatened the island’s health.Speaking to foreign reporters in Taipei, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said Taiwan wanted proper access to the WHO.“For Taiwan, what we want is first-hand information. Any second-hand information slows down any actions we take, and distorts our judgement about the epidemic, like we’re unable to see the woods for the trees,” he said.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“But if we can we get first-hand information within the organisation, we can see the whole picture and can react proactively by creating various systems or policies,” he added.“Our speed in reacting will become faster, so Taiwan does not become a gap” in epidemic prevention.Taiwan has produced a list of complaints against the WHO, including that it gave wrong case numbers for Taiwan, ignored requests for information, and has bent to Chinese pressure to interfere with the island’s requests for help.Both the WHO and China say Taiwan has been provided with the help it needs. China says only it has the right to speak for Taiwan’s 23 million people internationally, a claim Taipei’s democratically elected government angrily rejects.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakTaiwan has stepped up its campaign to attend, as an observer, this month’s virtual meeting of the WHO’s decision-making body, the World Health Assembly (WHA), though government and diplomatic sources say China will not agree to that.Taiwan attended the World Health Assembly as an observer from 2009-2016, when Taipei-Beijing relations were warmer.But China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, whom China views as a separatist, a charge she rejects.Chen would not say whether he was optimistic or pessimistic about Taiwan’s chances of participating, but said there was “of course no problem” in trying to reach a consensus to allow this to happen.“Our only standard is that we cannot be belittled,” he said.Steven Solomon, the WHO’s principal legal officer, said on Monday that the WHO recognised the People’s Republic of China as the “one legitimate representative of China”, in keeping with U.N. policy since 1971, and that the question of Taiwan’s attendance was one for the WHO’s 194 member states.Taiwan says the 1971 decision, under which Beijing assumed the U.N. China seat from Taipei, only resolved the issue of who represented China, not the issue of Taiwan, and did not grant China the power to represent Taiwan internationally.Chen said the world should not be locked in the past and have to stick by something from almost five decades ago.“The times keep changing,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/give-us-first-hand-information-to-fight-virus-taiwan-asks-who/story-EukffgnuFVlFSMV8dzXDbO.html

Increased suspicions also threatened to hurt US-China cooperation to fight the disease and restart the global economy.“It is time to end the blame game,” Cui said. “It is time to focus on the disease and rebuild trust between our two countries.”Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicTrump and his top aides have increasingly faulted China for the coronavirus’s deadly expansion across the US and around the world. The pathogen has killed more Americans than the Vietnam War, pushed the US economy toward recession and clouded Trump’s re-election prospects.‘Conspiracy Theories’While Trump has accused China of a cover-up and trying to hurt him politically, US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has gone further, claiming there is “enormous evidence” that the virus escaped from a high-security virology laboratory near the first known outbreak in Wuhan. Pompeo has advanced the theory despite Chinese denials and a lack of consensus among US intelligence agencies examining the virus’s origins.Although Cui made no mention of the lab claim, he denounced “conspiracy theories” about China’s geopolitical intentions. He also rejected calls for China to pay reparations for the damage wrought by the virus, saying similar responsibility wasn’t laid on countries where H1N1 or AIDS originated.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak“There is no denying that the first known case of Covid-19 was reported in Wuhan,” Cui said. “But this means only that Wuhan was the first victim of the virus. To ask a victim for compensation is simply ridiculous.”Cui has been seeking to ratchet down tensions with the US which have steadily escalated since he became ambassador in 2013. In March, Cui criticized a foreign ministry spokesman’s tweets about whether the virus was introduced to Wuhan by US Army athletes. Last month, he urged cooperation in a similar column published in the New York Times.Cui’s latest op-ed closed with a reference to the Republican Party’s first president, Abraham Lincoln, who Trump has been invoking as his re-election campaign heats up. “As President Abraham Lincoln called for ‘the better angels’ in his inauguration speech, I hope that the wisdom of preceding generations will guide us to choose the right side of history and work for our shared future together,” Cui said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-ambassador-to-us-urges-end-to-blame-game-over-pandemic/story-EqEGEhlgMtQawvKl2vnd1O.html
06-05-2020||World||Peru’s 35-year-old finance minister is suddenly a rock star||Everyone calls her Toni. Mothers take selfies of her with their children, and street hawkers push bracelets into her hand as presents. Artists sketch her portrait and post them to social media. TV networks vie for interviews and run profiles asking, “Who is Maria Antonieta Alva?”The answer: She’s the 35-year-old finance minister of Peru steering an ambitious recovery package during a devastating pandemic, and she is winning praise for its generosity to small businesses and ordinary citizens.“From a Latin perspective, Peru is a clear leader in terms of macro response,” said Ricardo Hausmann, a Harvard economist who was Alva’s professor and is leading a team of experts advising Peru and 10 other countries on mitigating the effects of coronavirus. “You could have imagined a very different outcome if Toni weren’t there.”Appointed only last October, Alva is increasingly seen as a central figure in President Martin Vizcarra’s cabinet, part of a rising generation of new leaders, and spends a great deal of time explaining public policy to a nervous public.“She’s very good at communicating and that’s become much more important in the current context,” said Carlos Oliva, Alva’s predecessor in the post.While Alva’s the only woman, she is part of a group of millennial finance ministers in the region, including Argentina’s Martin Guzman, 37, the Dominican Republic’s Juan Ariel Jimenez, 35, and Ecuador’s Richard Martinez, 39.These aren’t easy times to oversee policy and it remains to be seen whether Alva survives. Some economists forecast a drop in GDP of more than 10% this year, the worst in decades, along with mass unemployment. She also has to contend with a populist agenda from the congress (where the government has no representation) that undermines the ministry’s, with elections less than a year away.Her office said Alva wasn’t available for an interview.Back to GrowthAlva’s initial focus was on reversing a slump in government infrastructure outlays by helping regional and local authorities spend faster, which led to a record increase in public investment. She wanted to reduce deficits in health, education and infrastructure, and get Peru back to growth after a decade-low 2.2% rate last year.Since the pandemic broke -- and it has hit Peru especially hard despite an early severe lockdown -- her focus switched to containment, including aid for families and businesses, and preparing for a reactivation with this month’s reopening.The daughter of Jorge Alva, a civil engineer who’s rector of the Universidad Nacional de Ingenieria (and a former teacher of Vizcarra), Alva has said she was exposed to the extreme poverty in Peru as a child when she accompanied her father on visits to its hinterland, and was determined to change things.In a region known for its machismo, where female accomplishment is often largely seen through the prism of motherhood, Alva cuts an unusual figure, decked out in no-nonsense clothes and a distinctive piece of jewelry: a gold necklace with a pendant in the shape of Peru.“She’s strong but not aggressive,” observed Patricia Zarate, head of polling at the Institute of Peruvian Studies. “She shows it through her work. It’s a different type of female empowerment.”‘Just Machismo’Some sneered at her ministerial appointment, saying she was there because she was someone’s daughter rather than because of her years in public finance. “It’s impossible not to think this is just machismo,” she said at the time. “If I were a man, that wouldn’t necessarily have been called into question.”Alva attended a Peruvian university and then got a masters in public administration from Harvard in 2014. She spent most of the past decade working for the government in public planning and expenditure, including two years overseeing the country’s $52-billion national budget.Just months into her ministerial tenure, epidemiologists presented the government with a dilemma -- lock down the population, including millions of shopkeepers, artisans and street sellers who live hand-to-mouth, or the health system risks collapsing under the strain of virus patients.After consulting economists in Peru and overseas, she negotiated with cabinet colleagues to build a consensus for an array of solutions including cash handouts, payroll subsidies and government-backed business loans, none of which had been tried before in Peru.“It’s been her push within the government that has led to such a clear articulation of the measures and the response,” said Jaime Reusche, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service.Two weeks ago, Peru sold $3 billion of bonds in the international market at record low rates in a show of investor confidence.Country of ParadoxesPeru, with 32 million inhabitants, is a country of paradoxes. It has internationally recognized economic institutions and large foreign reserves, yet health care and education are among the most under-funded in the Americas.As a student Alva was troubled by those contradictions and by ongoing inequality and poverty, said Enrique Vasquez, who taught her at Universidad del Pacifico in Lima. While studying, she co-founded a charity to help poor children attend university and started a public-policy debate group. Upon graduation, she went to the Finance Ministry.She attended Harvard on scholarship and spent two months in India studying educational opportunities for girls. She returned to Peru to work at the Education Ministry, becoming head of planning and budget, before returning to the Finance Ministry to oversee the budget and a team of more than 150 people.It hasn’t been all smooth sailing as a minister. For many, the cash handouts are arriving too slowly, meaning the lockdown has left them with no income, food or shelter. As the virus digs deep, thousands who’ve lost jobs are leaving Lima and returning to their home provinces in desperation.In February, the chairman of Peru’s state oil company, Petroperu, quit after calling Alva stupid in a taped, expletive-laden conversation, for not authorizing $1.5 billion in financing. Days later, a group of university students draped banners over 18 highway bridges supporting Alva.Last week, there were rumors on social media of her resignation amid claims that her family was benefiting from the rescue package. She denied the resignation and said her finances were publicly available online.Vasquez, the professor, recalled a conversation he had with her when she was a student. “I said to her, ‘Toni, I hope one day you get the chance to be president of Peru. But you’re going to need to be minister first.’ She just smiled.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/peru-s-35-year-old-finance-minister-is-suddenly-a-rock-star/story-MSoxNx1mIee2M1J13ixVzL.html

A government spokesman confirmed his resignation.Britain, the world’s second worst-hit country after the US with more than 32,000 coronavirus deaths, imposed strict stay-at-home orders in late March.The government had ramped up its response to the crisis after research by Ferguson and his colleagues at Imperial College London warned that Covid-19 infections and deaths would spiral without drastic action.Ferguson’s resignation came after the Daily Telegraph reported that a woman, said to be his “lover”, came to his home in London on two occasions during the lockdown.“I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus, and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms,” the professor said.He added: “The government guidance is unequivocal, and is there to protect all of us.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was hospitalised by the disease and has now recovered, ordered the initial three-week lockdown on March 23.Under the measures, “non-essential” shops and services were shut while residents were told not to go out except for exercise and to buy essential items. Police were given powers to fine those flouting the rules.The lockdown was extended for another three weeks in mid-April, but Johnson is soon expected to set out his plan to lift the stringent rules, according to media reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-scientist-behind-lockdown-quits-after-breaking-social-distancing-rules/story-ivlT1pBPR0EbUwjxDv9kOM.html
06-05-2020||World||All you need to know about murder hornets which have invaded US||A giant species of bees have reached the US shores and are threatening the native population of insects there. Vespa Mandarinia, dubbed as murder hornets, were first discovered in Washington by a beekeeper and have alarmed the agricultural scientists.These giant bees though generally do not attack the humans or pets, but once threatened they can sting humans too. And their multiple stings can even kill them.Here are some things to know about murder hornets:• The stinging Vespa mandarinia can grow as large as 2-1/2 inches (6.4 cm) in length. They have a large orange/yellow head with prominent eyes, black and yellow striped abdomen and form large colonies that usually nest in the ground.• The species is native to Southeast Asia, China and Taiwan.• The murder hornets present a danger to agriculture and the apiary industry, because the insect is known to attack honey bees, with a few of the hornets capable of wiping out an entire hive in hours.• The Washington State Agricultural Department said that the murder hornets leave piles of dead bees, most of them headless, outside their beehive.• Scientists don’t know for sure how the Murder Hornet made its way to Blaine.

06-05-2020||World||After Covid-19, US now battles murder hornets which threaten humans too||The United States is already battling the deadly coronavirus pandemic, and it has a new problem to deal with: Murder hornets.The invasive and predatory insect has turned up in Washington state near the Canadian border, where they could potentially pose a threat to humans and the beekeeping industry.The stinging Vespa Mandarinia can grow as large as 2.5 inches in length and is native to Southeast Asia, China and Taiwan. It was first discovered in Blaine, Washington, in December by a homeowner though authorities are not sure how they reached the US.“An Asian giant hornet can sting you multiple times and deliver larger doses of venom just because of the size of them. The venom itself is fairly toxic and creates localized necrosis around the wound so you’ll see melting flesh around the wound,” managing entomologist at the Washington state Agriculture Department Sven-Erik Spichiger told news agency Reuters.“The hornets enter a slaughter phase where they kill bees by decapitating them. They then defend the hive as their own, taking the brood to feed their own young,” according to the official website of the Washington State Department of Agriculture. A few hornets can destroy a hive in a matter of hours, it further said.Scientists in the US are now hunting for the hornets, in a bid to eradicate the species before they wipe out the bee population in the country.While the hornets usually don’t attack people or pets, they can do so if threatened. Their stinger is longer than that of a honeybee and their venom is more toxic. They can also sting repeatedly. Multiple stings can kill humans, agricultural scientists in the US said.A report in the New York Times said that murder hornet stings are believed to cause “as many of 50 human fatalities every year”.The insects are roughly the size of a matchbox and have large yellow-red heads and a black-yellow striped body.“They’re like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face,” Susan Cobey, a bee breeder with Washington State University’s entomology department, said in a press release on Monday.The Vespa Mandarinia is the largest existing species of hornets in the world, according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture.Canada had also discovered Asian giant hornet in two locations in British Columbia in the fall of 2019, it further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-covid-19-us-now-battles-murder-hornets-which-threaten-humans-too/story-DQKoQakrsr87kl8W4iOs7J.html

06-05-2020||World||‘Pakistan is China’s colonial vassal’: Former Pentagon official||With souring relationship with Washington and growing business and strategic ties with Beijing, Pakistan is leading nothing more than a colony of China, said Dr Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon official.Pakistan joined hands with neighbouring China since after America’s growing relationship with India, a democratic nation having the world’s second-largest population.Rubin believes that Pakistani leaders see in China strategic depth, an ally able to deter Indian retaliation across the line-of-control, and a partner unlikely to criticise Pakistani corruption, its poor treatment of religious minorities and its internal human rights record.For China, Pakistan can be a major market, provide land links into West Asia, and a strategic port at Gwadar.In his article published by The National Interest, Rubin said, “Pakistanis will soon realise -- if they have not already -- what a devil’s bargain their country has made. In China, Pakistan has tied itself to a country that is responsible for the incarceration in concentration camps of one million Muslims solely on the basis of their religion and it has partnered with a country that thinks nothing about killing Pakistanis and humiliating Pakistan.”Now, it is also increasingly clear that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) may be becoming a major road for transmission into Pakistan and, more broadly, South Asia.“While Pakistan has struggled with moderate succeed in stamping out hotspots where the coronavirus has erupted, communities living along the corridor in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan are fearful that Chinese trade and traffic along the corridor as well as its expedition of internal Pakistani commerce across regions, could enable the epidemic to spread like a wildfire. It may be this pressure which is leading Prime Minister Imran Khan to lift Pakistan’s lockdown prematurely,” said the article.Rubin said that the full danger of spread along the CPEC may not yet be apparent. Weather blocks corridor passes during winter, but as spring thaws the ice and snow, commerce usually explodes.Many Chinese workers had also returned home for the Chinese New Year, which coincided with necessary winter-related construction delay. But several hundred Chinese workers have now returned to Pakistan to work on the project, bringing the total numbers of Chinese workers on different CPEC projects to between 10,000 and 15,000.“There is no indication that China has set up any testing and quarantine sites for CPEC workers in Pakistan,” he said.Dr Rubin added, “Gilgit-Baltistan may be the canary in the coal mine as locals suffer for the sake of Pakistan’s China partnership. It is one of Pakistan’s harder-hit regions. It has only one testing centre and can test only fifteen people daily. While there are reportedly nine ventilators in the region, local doctors estimate they need at least two hundred of them. Pakistani officials have long neglected the region, even while working to strip away its right to self-rule.”Pakistani authorities in Islamabad may accept Chinese assurances in order not to hurt Pakistan’s bottom line and insult Beijing, never mind that it was Chinese lies and obfuscation that enabled the epidemic to spread so far in the first place.“It has been easy for Pakistani nationalists to use anti-Americanism and grievances real or imagined in order to shirk responsibility for their own actions and cynically drive a wedge between Islamabad and Washington. China has simultaneously courted Pakistan as Islamabad looked for new partners. Pakistanis may soon recognise, however, that China seeks not a partner, but a colonial vassal, the deaths of whose citizens it sees as wholly irrelevant,” said the former Pentagon official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-not-pakistan-s-key-partner-but-colonial-vassal-former-pentagon-official/story-4kan7FFgiVw36aGRNjs8WL.html
06-05-2020||World||White House begins talks on winding down coronavirus task force, says Mike Pence||The Trump administration has initiated talks on winding down the White House Task Force on coronavirus and gradually delegating its responsibilities to the relevant federal agencies, US Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday.Pence leads the task force.“I think we are having conversations about that and about what the proper time is for the task force to complete its work and for the ongoing efforts to take place on an agency-by-agency level,” Pence told a select group of reporters.The White House has already begun to talk about a transition plan with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), he said.The news was first reported by The New York Times.In Arizona, President Donald Trump also confirmed the news.“I think we are looking at phase two and we are looking at other phases,” he said, adding that the country is starting to open up and noting that the task force has done “a phenomenal job”.Responding to a question, Trump indicated that the task force has done an incredible job. The president said he would not need to consult certain people, such as those who worked on ventilators.“We will have something in a different form,” he said, describing the need to focus on both safety and reopening.Asked why is now the time to wind down the task force if there could be a recurrence, he said, “Because we cannot close our country down for the next five years. The administration has learned a lot.” The president noted that health experts believe there could be a recurrence but they would need to “put it out”.By Tuesday, more than 71,000 Americans had died in the last three months due to coronavirus and the number of those infected crossed 12 lakh, the highest across the world. But with the decline in the number of new cases and fatalities over the last one week, quite a few states have started opening up.“It really is all a reflection of the tremendous progress we have made as a country. The president stood up the White House Coronavirus Task Force in January to marshal a national response,” Pence told reporters at the White House.As the head of the task force, Pence has held daily meetings with its members comprising eminent doctors, health experts, heads of multiple federal agencies and cabinet members.“As I have said before, as we continue to practise social distancing and states engage in safe and responsible reopening plans, I truly believe -- and the trend lines support it -- that we could be in a very different place. And by late May and early June -- and that probably represents the timetable for our agencies,” he said.Responding to a question, Pence said the task force might be closed by early June.“I think we are starting to look at the Memorial Day window, early June window, as a time when we could begin to transition back to having our agencies to manage our national response in a more traditional manner,” he said.Dr Deborah Birx, a member of the task force, said the White House will “continue to review and analyse data and work with the departments in agencies to help that data inform their decision-making processes”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-begins-talks-on-winding-down-coronavirus-task-force-says-us-vice-president-pence/story-ip0uUiIIrzzk0cX01Ue76O.html

After much thought, he made the difficult decision to shave his beard off.”Sanjeet told the Montreal Gazette, “But because Covid-19 has become so rampant in our community, it just wasn’t feasible anymore (not to wear a N-95 mask). There are so many people coming in. I felt I just couldn’t sit on the sidelines. This was an exception to the rule, so we had to do what we had to do to help out.”Canada’s total coronavirus death toll rose to 3,915 on Tuesday, up about four per cent from 3,766 on Monday, according to official data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sikh-doctors-in-canada-make-extremely-difficult-decision-to-serve-covid-19-patients/story-dNIx5zeXWEkCdCkWFos2jK.html
06-05-2020||World||Covid-19 lockdown: Indian citizens in Canada begin registration for repatriation||Even though Canada does not feature in the first list of countries from which India will repatriate citizens, requests are already pouring into Indian missions in the country as those stranded seek to return.Nearly three lakh Indians, mainly students, are believed to be stranded in Canada due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While the Indian Government has now announced that citizens will be brought back, with 12 countries in the initial list, Indian officials in Canada have already started preparations for the repatriation flights.India’s High Commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria said that the mission’s website had posted a registration form for those seeking to return and in less than 24 hours since the announcement in India, it recorded over 2,000 entries. “As a contingency planning exercise, the High Commission of India in Canada is preparing a list of distressed Indian citizens in Canada,” a release from the High Commission said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOfficials are hopeful that Canada will be in a part of the second phase of repatriation. Among the categories outlined are Indians who have been laid off from their jobs in Canada, those facing expiry of their visa, those in a medical emergency, elderly or pregnant women, tourists or visitors stuck in Canada or students who are stuck as their educational institutions have closed down. The cost is likely to about Rs 100,000 for the one-way ticket aboard the non-scheduled commercial flight operated by Air India.Those returning from Canada will not require a Covid-19 negative certification because that is not issued in the country, but they will be subject to the norms notified by the government. Medical screening will be undertaken prior to embarkation and only asymptomatic passengers will be allowed to travel. People who have compelling reasons for travel will also have to sign an agreement to abide by the health protocols in India. They will have to pay for the mandatory 14-day quarantine period in a hospital or institutional facility selected by the relevant state government. The passengers will undergo a Covid-19 test after a fortnight.Starting registrations at this time will help them plan out the schedule of flights between selected destinations in India more efficiently, Indian officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/repatriation-registration-story/story-BeoG8GLssMVtH5tOJ0PDqK.html

A video went viral on social media showing the expat being insulted by an Arabic-speaking man, who does not appear in the clip, for having not embraced Islam and for not fasting, the official Saudi Press Agency reported. A monitoring centre affiliated with the public prosecution examined the video which “shows the citizen’s use of abusive words against the Asian resident on the pretext of inviting him to Islam,” an official source at the Public Prosecution was quoted as saying. “The public prosecution ordered the arrest of the abusive citizen,” the source added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-orders-arrest-of-its-citizen-for-abusing-non-muslim-asian-expat/story-JKccBXDf35ucl3M9HftgrI.html
06-05-2020||World||US infection rate rising outside New York as states open up||Take the New York metropolitan area’s progress against the coronavirus out of the equation and the numbers show the rest of the US is moving in the wrong direction, with the known infection rate rising even as states move to lift their lockdowns, an Associated Press analysis found Tuesday.New confirmed infections per day in the US exceed 20,000, and deaths per day are well over 1,000, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. And public health officials warn that the failure to flatten the curve and drive down the infection rate in places could lead to many more deaths — perhaps tens of thousands — as people are allowed to venture out and businesses reopen.“Make no mistakes: This virus is still circulating in our community, perhaps even more now than in previous weeks” said Linda Ochs, director of the Health Department in Shawnee County, Kansas.Elsewhere around the world, Britain’s official coronavirus death toll, at more than 29,000, topped that of Italy to become the highest in Europe and second-highest in the world behind the United States. The official number of dead worldwide surpassed a quarter-million, by Johns Hopkins’ count, though the true toll is believed to be much higher.The densely packed New York metropolitan area, consisting of about 20 million people across a region that encompasses the city’s northern suburbs, Long Island and northern New Jersey, has been the hardest-hit corner of the country, accounting for at least one-third of the nation’s 70,000 deaths.When the still locked-down area is included, new infections in the US appear to be declining, according to the AP analysis. It found that the five-day rolling average for new cases has decreased from 9.3 per 100,000 people three weeks ago on April 13 to 8.6 on Monday.But subtracting the New York area from the analysis changes the story. Without it, the rate of new cases in the US increased over the same period from 6.2 per 100,000 people to 7.5.While the daily number of new deaths in the New York area has declined markedly in recent weeks, it has essentially plateaued in the rest of the US Without greater New York, the rolling five-day average for new deaths per 500,000 people dropped slightly from 1.86 on April 20th to 1.82 on Monday.US testing for the virus has been expanded, and that has probably contributed to the increasing rate of confirmed infections. But it doesn’t explain the entire increase, said Dr. Zuo-Feng Zhang, a public health researcher at the University of California at Los Angeles.“This increase is not because of testing. It’s a real increase,” he said.Pockets of America far from New York City are seeing ominous trends.Deaths in Iowa surged to a new daily high of 19 on Tuesday, and 730 workers at a single Tyson Foods pork plant tested positive. On Monday, Shawnee County, home to Topeka, Kansas, reported a doubling of cases from last week on the same day that business restrictions began to ease.Gallup, New Mexico, is under a strict lockdown until Thursday because of an outbreak, with guarded roadblocks to prevent travel in and out and a ban on more than two people in a vehicle. Authorities have deployed water tankers, hospital space is running short, and a high school gym is now a recuperation center with 60 oxygen-supplied beds.On Monday, a model from the University of Washington nearly doubled its projection of COVID-19 deaths in the US to around 134,000 through early August, with a range of 95,000 to nearly 243,000.Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the institute that created the projections, said the increase is largely because most states are expected to ease restrictions by next week.Without stay-at-home orders and similar measures, Murray said, “we would have had exponential growth, much larger epidemics and deaths in staggering numbers.” But cooperation is waning, with cellphone location data showing people are getting out more, even before their states reopen, he said.President Donald Trump, asked about the projections before traveling to Arizona to visit a mask factory, disputed the accuracy of models in general and said keeping the economy closed carries deadly costs of its own, such as drug abuse and suicide.“We have to get our country open,” Trump said.A senior US government scientist alleged in a whistleblower complaint Tuesday that the administration failed to prepare for the onslaught of the coronavirus. Dr. Rick Bright also said he was reassigned to a lesser role because he resisted political pressure to allow widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug unproven for treating COVID-19, that was being pushed by Trump.The Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement that he was transferred to the National Institutes of Health to work on coronavirus testing, a crucial assignment.Zhang, the UCLA researcher, said it’s worrying that the rate of new cases is increasing at the same time some states are easing up: “We’re one country. If we’re not moving in the same step, we’re going to have a problem.”He said he is particularly concerned about Florida and Texas, where cases have been rising steadily and the potential for explosions seems high.While death rates in some places have been trending down, that could change and hospitals could become overwhelmed, he said.Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, said she and colleagues keep warning governors against “skipping phases” in federal guidelines recommending that business and other institutions, like schools, be reopened in phases.“We don’t want to see serious illness and mortality increase,” Birx said.In Europe, meanwhile, Britain said about 29,400 people with COVID-19 have died in its hospitals, nursing homes and other settings, while Italy reported just over 29,300 confirmed fatalities.Both counts are probably underestimates because they do not include suspected cases. Britain reported more than 32,000 deaths in which COVID-19 was either confirmed or suspected; a comparable figure for Italy was not available.Even so, the rate of deaths and hospitalizations in Britain was on the decline, and the government prepared to begin loosening its lockdown.A trial began of a mobile phone app that U.K. authorities hope will help contain the outbreak by warning people if they have been near an infected individual; it could be rolled out later this month.Many European countries that have relaxed strict lockdowns after new infections tapered off were watching their virus numbers warily.“We know with great certainty that there will be a second wave — the majority of scientists are sure of that. And many also assume that there will be a third wave,” said Lothar Wieler, head of Germany’s national disease control center.South Korea reported two new cases Wednesday, its lowest daily total since February, and the country’s baseball season began the previous day with no spectators allowed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-infection-rate-rising-outside-new-york-as-states-open-up/story-ccN3D3niEkZ4hRRvhU9aHI.html
06-05-2020||World||Brazil’s Bolsonaro accused of meddling in Rio federal police||President Jair Bolsonaro was in a stir again Tuesday after Brazil’s former justice minister reportedly accused him of trying to personally pick the head of federal police operations in Rio de Janeiro, where the far-right leader has a home and two of his sons are politicians.TV Globo and mainstream Brazilian newspapers reported that former Justice Minister Sérgio Moro told investigators that Bolsonaro pressured him in March to accept a political appointee to head the country’s federal police office in Rio.The president’s sons, Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro and city council member Carlos Bolsonaro, are under investigation by Rio state prosecutors and police. The president said Tuesday that neither he nor those two sons are subjects of federal police investigations.Moro, who shot to fame as the judge who oversaw the mammoth Car Wash corruption investigation that convicted dozens of politicians and business executives, is seen as a hero by many Brazilians and was publicly granted free rein to operate in the Bolsonaro administration.He resigned April 24 after Bolsonaro fired the head of the federal police without consulting him.On Tuesday, the president confirmed that the head of federal police operations in Rio was leaving that post, but said the officer was being promoted.“I have nothing against the superintendent of Rio de Janeiro, and I don’t interfere in the federal police, and he’s being invited to be an executive director,” Bolsonaro told reporters in the capital, Brasilia.The embattled Brazilian leader also accused Moro of violating national security law by allegedly giving journalists the content of their conversations.According to the leaked summary of Moro’s deposition in the southern city of Curitiba, the former minister said Bolsonaro sent him “more or less” the following message in a text message: “You have 27 superintendencies (of the federal police). I just want one, the one in Rio de Janeiro.” The reports did not show printed images of that exchange.Bolsonaro’s prosecutor-general requested an investigation into the allegations of presidential interference that Moro made when he resigned, which a Supreme Court justice granted. Another justice nullified Bolsonaro’s first choice for the federal police directorship amid reports of a longstanding close relationship.Brazil’s top court has authorized federal police and prosecutors to interview Cabinet ministers in the Bolsonaro administration about Moro’s accusations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-s-bolsonaro-accused-of-meddling-in-rio-federal-police/story-cgbRPg5XKDm8yf4CF2noeM.html
06-05-2020||World||‘It’s possible there’ll be some’: Trump admits US reopening will cost more lives||President Donald Trump conceded Tuesday that more Americans will die in reopening the US economy but underlined his insistence on a dwindling coronavirus threat by refusing to wear a mask, even as he toured a mask-making factory.Asked by ABC News whether a lifting of social distancing measures and reopening of the shuttered economy will lead to higher death tolls, Trump said “it’s possible there will be some.”“Because you won’t be locked into an apartment or a house or whatever it is,” Trump said at the Honeywell factory in Phoenix, Arizona, which he visited on his first major trip since the coronavirus lockdown began.“Will some people be affected badly? Yes,” he admitted earlier at the factory. “But we have to get our country open.”Trump’s November reelection campaign is reeling from the massive shutdown ordered to try and stop the spread of the virus, which has already killed 70,000 Americans and is forecast to take tens of thousands more lives.Praising the Honeywell workers, who churn out masks used by medical staff and other first responders, Trump reiterated that it’s time to look ahead.“I want to be a cheerleader,” he said.Bolstering that shift of direction, the White House said that Trump’s emergency coordination group for the pandemic would be disbanding, probably by early June.Unpresidential masks?Trump’s audience at Honeywell sat masked in compliance with US government recommendations and their own company rule, which was clearly displayed on a sign in the facility reading: “Please wear your mask at all times.”Trump had teased as he left Washington that after months of resistance he might finally cover his face.The fact that he skipped the opportunity to make a statement about safety was in line with his new focus on getting Americans to return to work.And he has been skeptical about masks since early on.White House medical experts and even First Lady Melania Trump promote masks as a crucial tool in fighting the viral spread.But the president, tuned closely into his loyal right-wing base, has used his massive visibility to downplay the need.“I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don’t know,” he said in April, apparently suggesting a mask would be unpresidential. “Somehow, I don’t see it for myself.”Alterative factsTrump’s Arizona mask moment came after his vice president, Mike Pence, caused an uproar a week ago when he was photographed mask-less during a visit to the famous Mayo Clinic hospital in Rochester, Minnesota, which requires visitors to cover up.Pence -- unusually for a member of the Trump administration -- publicly admitted he’d been wrong.“I didn’t think it was necessary, but I should have worn a mask,” he said on Sunday.On a subsequent trip, Pence did wear a mask.The White House says that because top officials and their guests are frequently tested for the coronavirus they generally don’t need to follow the guidance.However, the controversy runs deeper, reflecting a dispute over facts that has turned swaths of the United States into camps where the left and right see different basic realities.Polls show that Democrats support face covering as a sign of shared responsibility, while some Republicans see mask-wearing orders as a big government threat to individual liberty.Trump-supported groups protesting the coronavirus lockdown -- sometimes ostentatiously brandishing firearms and parading in paramilitary garb -- liken going mask-free to an act of political independence.In Stillwater, Oklahoma, and other cities, local leaders abandoned orders to wear masks after threats of violence.A common slogan at the protests now is that the entire pandemic is a “hoax.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-s-possible-there-ll-be-some-trump-admits-us-reopening-will-cost-more-lives/story-gIGLKqdqTzdC7FQoBxo6vO.html

The Trump administration also is being sued by citizens denied virus aid because they are married to undocumented immigrants.The $2 trillion Cares Act, approved by Congress in March, provides $1,200 payments to US taxpayers who earn as much as $75,000 -- plus $500 for each child. But to be eligible, both spouses in families that file joint tax returns must have Social Security numbers, which are unavailable to the childrens’ parents, according to the complaint filed Tuesday in federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland, against the US government and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.“The refusal to distribute this benefit to US citizen children undermines the Cares Act’s goal of providing assistance to Americans in need, frustrates the act’s efforts to jumpstart the economy, and punishes citizen children for their parents’ status -- punishment that is particularly nonsensical given that undocumented immigrants, collectively, pay billions of dollars each year in taxes,” according to the complaint.The children, who are identified only by their initials, are seeking to represent a class of millions of other kids who are US citizens and have parents who are unable to get the $500 payments because one or both of them is undocumented.The White House and Treasury didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The case is R.V. v.

06-05-2020||World||Trump admin officials ignored Covid-19 warnings, alleges fired American scientist||Top health officials of the Trump administration repeatedly warned the multiple warnings with regard to the coronavirus pandemic, including the alleged poor quality of malaria drug hydroxychloroquine from India and Pakistan, a fired American scientist has said in a whistleblower complaint.In a complaint filed on Tuesday before the US Office of Special Counsel, which oversees protection of whistleblowers, Rick Bright alleged that top officials of the Department of Health and Human Services repeatedly ignored his messages and that of others with regard to personal protective equipment and medicines like hydroxychloroquine in particular.When fired, Bright was head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a research agency within the Health and Human Services (HHS) Department. He reported directly to Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary of preparedness and response at the US Department of Health and Human Services.“Dr Bright remained extremely concerned about the drug’s importation from Pakistan and India because the FDA had not inspected the drugs or the factory that produced them,” the complaint said.“In Dr Bright’s experience, drugs from uninspected factories can be contaminated or dosed improperly, and this could obviously be dangerous to those who took the medication. Apparently unconcerned about this known danger, Dr Kadlec and others in the administration sought to ‘flood’ the marketplace with these drugs,” it alleged.The Trump administration has imported nearly five crore units of the malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, which in March had received Emergency Use Authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The Trump administration, the complaint said, was not interested in hearing from Bright and his department or subject matter experts.“Dr Bright and his team had apparently spent all their political capital in their effort to limit chloroquine and rushing into a potentially dangerous situation and that there was no one to help stop the push to ‘flood’ the country with this unproven and potentially dangerous drug,” the complaint said.“He concluded that his only remaining avenue was to share his concerns with the journalist who understood the specific issue and risks associated with these drugs and who had already gathered substantial information from multiple sources,” it added.The complaint alleged that HHS Secretary Alex Azar’s directive to secure a Nationwide Expanded Access IND protocol for chloroquine, based on scant scientific evidence and on such a short time-frame, sent Bright and his colleagues scrambling.Within the hour, Bright had called a meeting of Dr Linda Lambert, Chief Medical Officer Dr Robert Walker, Director of Regulatory and Quality Affairs Dr Tremel Faison, and Drs Johnson, Disbrow and Houchens to discuss the directive.The group expressed serious concerns about a Nationwide Expanded Access IND protocol for chloroquine given the lack of clinical data available about its therapeutic benefits and concerns about its potential safety risks, especially if administered without close physician supervision, it said.Bright and his FDA colleagues were also concerned about the quality and potential toxicity of the chloroquine supplies produced and shipped in from facilities in India and Pakistan that were not approved by the FDA and therefore, not approved to be used in the US marketplace.The HHS clinical and regulatory expert teams worked frantically for 48 hours without sleep to come up with a plan that would ensure the greatest level of safety for people who received this drug.They discussed narrower options for the rollout, including a small pilot study, and established an inter-agency working group of clinical and regulatory experts to determine the safest way to make the unproven drug available without causing harm to the American public, the complaint said.When fired earlier, Bright alleged that he was ousted because of his “insistence” that the government spend funds on “safe and scientifically-vetted solutions” to address the coronavirus crisis and not on “drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-admin-officials-ignored-covid-19-warnings-alleges-fired-american-scientist/story-QEWWk2n3jRvFrWxUlChKWL.html

The lab theory has been pushed by the Trump administration, which has been critical of China’s handling of the outbreak.WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said, “We have not received specific evidence from the US government relating to the purported origin of the virus. So from our perspective, this remains speculative.”Titled “Evil Pompeo is wantonly spewing poison and spreading lies”, a commentary by Chinese broadcaster CCTV cited the WHO’s Ryan and Columbia University virologist Ian Lipkin, who claimed that the virus is natural in origin. “These flawed and unreasonable remarks by American politicians make it clear to more and more people that no ‘evidence’ exists,” it said. “The so-called ‘virus leaked from a Wuhan lab’ hype is a complete and utter lie.”Commentaries in People’s Daily called Pompeo and ex-White House strategist Steve Bannon “lying clowns”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-spat-intensifies-as-china-calls-mike-pompeo-insane-for-lab-claim/story-O3kQi1KGnqMd9MM23ahifI.html
06-05-2020||World||Trump dismisses report claiming US Covid-19 daily toll could reach 3,000 in June||President Donald Trump and the White House on Tuesday rejected a report suggesting the daily US death toll due to the coronavirus could reach 3,000 in June.The US death toll from the coronavirus was nearing 70,000 on Tuesday, and there were more than 1.2 million confirmed cases.However, several states have started reporting flattening of the curve decline in new cases and death rates. As a result, several states have announced plans to open up their economy in a phased manner.In its report, Johns Hopkins University projected new coronavirus cases in the US reaching 200,000 daily by June 1 and fatalities around 3,000. “Those projections are with no mitigation. We are doing mitigation,” Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews on his way to Arizona.In a statement, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that the Johns Hopkins’ study being pushed around by the media as factual is based on faulty assumptions and is in no way representative of any federal government projections.John Hopkins University in a separate statement said that the research conducted by it for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was to assist in planning for various scenarios and was not to be used for the official forecast.The New York Times was the first newspaper to report about it on Monday.“As Johns Hopkins stated, should not be taken as a forecast,” McEnany said.“This study considered zero mitigation, meaning it was conducted as though no federal guidelines were in place, no contract tracing, no expansion of testing, while removing all shelter in place protocols laid out in the phased approach of the Opening Up America Again guidelines for individuals with co-morbidities,” she said.“The media should be more responsible in its reporting and give the full set of information to the American public,” McEnany said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-white-house-dismiss-report-claiming-us-covid-19-toll-could-reach-3-000-in-june/story-ONvSHzo2osVfaqYIjGDNpJ.html
