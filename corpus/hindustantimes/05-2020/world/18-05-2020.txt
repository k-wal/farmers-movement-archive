It only flags the possibility of these protestors carrying back the virus from high-infection areas.These anonymized location data collected from in-phone apps and analyzed by VoteMap showed people traveling more than 150 miles to these protests, some were seen crossing state lines on their way back. Devices from the armed protests in Madison, Michigan, which caught the world’s attention, were seen returning to remote areas of the state.Dr Rob Davidson, of the Committee to Protect Medicare that provided the data to the Guardian, told the publication, “it’s hard to draw a straight line between devices, individuals at these protests, and cases.”President Donald Trump has backed these protests as he continues to press states to reopen, allow businesses to resume operations and let people return to work, arguing the lockdown may be causing more damage to the country than the epidemic. His eyes, here, are on his re-elections prospects in the face record unemployment and a severe downturn.The White House has sought to shift the blame thus, mostly on to China, through increasing public attacks and on the World Health Organization and, internally, its own federal agencies. Peter Navarro, a senior adviser to the president, said Sunday the country was let down by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the premier federal body charged with monitoring and preventing health crises such as the Covid-19 epidemic.“Early on in this virus, the CDC, which really had the most trusted brand around the world in this space, really let the country down with the testing because not only did they keep the testing within the bureaucracy, they had a bad test. And that did set us back,” he told NBC news.Testing has continued to be an issues. The federal government says every American who needs to be tested, according to CDC checklist of symptoms, can be tested and critics say more kits are needed to scale up surveillance in view of the reopening. New governor Andrew Cuomo took Covid-19 test at his daily briefing on Sunday to make the point. “This is a very big advantage for us, because testing originally was used to control the virus,” Cuomo said. “Now testing is going to be helpful in monitoring the virus.”The number of US fatalities from Covid-19 went up by 808 over the past 24 hours to 89,567 and reported infections went up by 18,937 to 1.48 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anti-lockdown-protests-in-us-may-spread-covid-19-says-report/story-0SanDLJ6wfPEZIMMef9ErK.html
18-05-2020||World||Finally China gives in, agrees for probe into Covid-19 origin, WHO response||China on Monday gave in to mounting international pressure for a probe into the origin of Covid-19 and a review of the World Health Organisation’s response to the pandemic. President Xi Jinping told the World Health Assembly that China had acted with ‘openness, transparency and responsibility’ when the disease, which has impacted billions of people across the world, first broke out.President Xi, who had been invited to speak at the opening ceremony after the European Union-drafted resolution to push for a probe was supported by more than a 100 countries, said Beijing supported calls for a comprehensive review of the global response but felt this exercise should be carried out after the world gets a grip on the situation. The world’s immediate priority should be saving people.“China supports the idea of a comprehensive review of the global response to COVID-19 after it is brought under control to sum up experience and address deficiencies,” President Xi told the assembly, the UN global health body’s policy making body.China had previously opposed calls for such investigations from Washington and Canberra.The health assembly is expected to formally take up the resolution backed by over 120 countries tomorrow. “It is a formality now… No one is objecting to it now,” a diplomat in Geneva told Hindustan Times.President Xi’s argument at the assembly mirrored the one presented by World Health Organisation director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus after a barrage of criticism, much of it emanating from the United States in the initial days.Tedros has been blamed for backing Beijing’s narrative and showering praise on President Xi for his handling of the disease around the same time that there was growing evidence of efforts to play down the spread of the disease in January. He was seen standing with Beijing again when the United States restricted flights from China.There is no need for measures that “unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade”, the WHO chief said on February 3.At Monday’s World Health Assembly, President Xi reciprocated, telling the 194-member body that the WHO’s contribution under Dr Tedros had been applauded by the international community.“At this crucial juncture, to support WHO is to support international cooperation and the battle for saving lives as well,” President Xi said.The draft resolution that had been pushed by Australia and the European Union had proposed an inquiry into the animal to human transmission of the Sars-CoV-2 President Xi’s comments, made during a video speech to the World Health Assembly, come as a resolution pushed by the European Union and Australia calling for a review of the origin and spread of the coronavirus disease picked up momentum.By the time the truncated virtual meet started, the 54-nation Africa Group also extended support. This includes Ethiopia, home to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus who made history in 2017 when he was elected WHO chief.Tedros was not just the first African to hold the post but also the first WHO chief not to be a medical doctor. The former Ethiopian minister holds a masters in immunology of infectious diseases and a Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD) in community health.Tedros, who spoke minutes after President Xi, said the inquiry would come “at the earliest appropriate moment” and provide recommendations for future preparedness.“We all have lessons to learn from the pandemic. Every country and every organisation must examine its response and learn from its experience. WHO is committed to transparency, accountability and continuous improvement,” Tedros said.The review must encompass responsibility of “all actors in good faith,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/finally-china-gives-in-agrees-to-probe-covid-19-origin-who-response/story-gb3ZadVm3HrKnnCDiClaLP.html
18-05-2020||World||‘Loss of taste, smell’: UK adds core Covid-19 symptoms||The Boris Johnson government on Monday included the loss of taste and smell to the core symptoms of coronavirus after a large number of people and ENT (ear, nose, throat) doctors reported the symptoms, as the number of cases in the UK approached 2.5 lakh.Updating the symptoms list means such individuals would now be eligible for a test.As of Sunday evening, 34,636 deaths and 243,303 cases were registered across the UK, retaining it on the top of the grim list in Europe. The number of deaths in a day was the lowest at 170, as some lockdown curbs were eased in England.Health officials advised Britons that from Monday, all individuals should self-isolate if they develop a new continuous cough or fever or anosmia, which is the medical term for the loss of or a change in normal sense of smell; it can also affect sense of taste as the two are closely linked.The four chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland said: “We have been closely monitoring the emerging data and evidence on Covid-19 and, after thorough consideration, we are now confident enough to recommend this new measure”.“The individual’s households should also self-isolate for 14 days as per the current guidelines and the individual should stay at home for seven days, or longer if they still have symptoms other than cough or loss of sense of smell”.According to Tim Spector, head of the department of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, there are 50,000 to 70,000 people in the UK with coronavirus who are not being told to self-isolate, because so far only temperature and cough were considered the major symptoms.Nearly 1.5 million people have logged on to an app developed at the college that tracks a wide range of symptoms and changes, he said.Spector told BBC: “It (the app) tells us that we’ve got at least 100,000 cases at the moment of people who are infected. And this is from our data, although the NHS would underestimate that because they’re not counting all the symptoms”.“This country is missing the ball in underestimated cases but also putting people at risk, and continuing the epidemic. So we really do need to tell Public Health England to get in line with the rest of the world, and make people more aware. There’s no point telling people to be alert if they don’t know the symptoms”.Business secretary Alok Sharma announced at the daily briefing in Downing Street that the clinical trial for a vaccine at the University of Oxford is “progressing well”, with all Phase 1 participants receiving their dose on schedule earlier this week.He said: “They are now being monitored closely by the clinical trial team. The speed at which Oxford University has designed and organised these complex trials is genuinely unprecedented”.“Imperial College are also making good progress, and will be looking to move into clinical trials by mid-June, with larger scale trials planned to begin in October. So far the government has invested £47 million in the Oxford and Imperial vaccine programmes”.According to Johnson, the vaccine is a “very long way off” and may “not come to fruition”, but the government announced a £93 million investment for a new Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre to produce it on a large scale if any of the trials succeed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/loss-of-taste-smell-uk-adds-core-covid19-symptoms/story-HtUDeV0Xg3YNJAnupDGcsJ.html
18-05-2020||World||China’s coronavirus vaccine will be global public good, Xi Says||China will make its coronavirus vaccine a global public good once one is available, President Xi Jinping told the World Health Organization’s governing body.Xi’s comments come amid growing concern that countries will put national interests first in the quest for a protective shot, seen as the key to getting economies moving again. The WHO is pushing a proposal that aims to ensure broad access to treatments and vaccines while offering an appropriate reward to creators.“Covid-19 vaccine development and deployment in China, when available, will be made a global public good, which will be China’s contribution to ensuring vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries,” Xi said in a speech to the World Health Assembly.Among the dozens of vaccine projects under way worldwide, China has five candidates already in human trials. More will be approved next month.The country has faced rising scrutiny over its handling of the virus, especially from members of the Trump administration. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said in a television appearance that the country sent “hundreds of thousands of Chinese on aircraft to Milan, New York and around the world to seed” it.Xi said China acted with transparency and responsibility all along, and that it provided information to the WHO and countries in the most timely fashion. China will also provide $2 billion over two years to support the fight against the pandemic, especially in developing countries, he said.Some companies involved in vaccine development have said countries that provide funding will get first dibs.AstraZeneca Plc Chief Exective Officer Pascal Soriot said the U.K. will take priority for the University of Oxford’s fast-moving effort to develop a shot. French drugmaker Sanofi’s vaccine that received funding from the U.S. will likely be used there initially, CEO Paul Hudson said last week. Sanofi said later that its vaccine would be available to everyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-coronavirus-vaccine-will-be-global-public-good-xi-says/story-j5bDsvLgVjK2MdelB3mMsI.html
18-05-2020||World||EU calls for independent probe of WHO’s coronavirus pandemic response||The European Union and other countries on Monday called for an independent evaluation of the World Health Organization’s response to the coronavirus pandemic “to review experience gained and lessons learned.” The resolution has the support of more than half of WHO’s member countries and will be discussed this week at the decision-making body of the UN health agency, being held virtually this year.The proposal is intended to initiate “a stepwise process of impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation” of WHO’s efforts to coordinate the international response to Covid-19, including the functioning of international health law and its actions within the greater UN health system. The move comes amid Australia’s call for an independent inquiry into the origins of the pandemic and WHO’s response to it — and after US President Donald Trump’s repeated accusations that WHO helped China cover up the extent of the initial Covid-19 outbreak. Trump has also called for an immediate halt to all US funding to the UN health agency.The EU resolution proposes that the independent evaluation should be initiated “at the earliest appropriate moment” and should, among other issues, examine “the actions of WHO and their timelines pertaining to the Covid-19 pandemic.” WHO announced the coronavirus outbreak to be a global health emergency on January 30, its highest level of alert. In the following weeks, WHO warned countries there was a narrowing “window of opportunity” to prevent the virus from spreading globally. WHO officials, however, repeatedly described the transmission of the virus as “limited” and said it wasn’t as transmissible as flu; experts have since said Covid-19 spreads even faster. It declared the outbreak to be a pandemic on March 11, after the virus had killed thousands globally and sparked large epidemics in South Korea, Italy, Iran and elsewhere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-calls-for-independent-probe-of-who-s-coronavirus-pandemic-response/story-1u5LAKrZUTiQ2oTgM6QoWL.html

The foreign ministry statement came hours before the UN’s global health agency’s two-day virtual meet begins on Monday.The resolution does not single out China or any other country but calls for an “impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation” of “the (WHO)-coordinated international health response to Covid-19.”“Initiate, at the earliest appropriate moment, and in consultation with Member States, 1 a stepwise process of impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation, including using existing mechanisms, 2 as appropriate, to review experience gained and lessons learned from the WHO-coordinated international health response to COVID-19,” the draft resolution said.Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said on Monday Australia wants the resolution to stipulate that the inquiry be “impartial, independent and comprehensive.”In a separate statement, the Chinese foreign ministry announced that President Xi Jinping will address the World Health Assembly’s opening ceremony via videolink later on Monday. President Xi had not been listed as a speaker in the schedule circulated by the WHO earlier. The foreign ministry said President Xi had been invited to speak by WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. After emerging in China, the virus had rapidly spread around world, killing more than 315,000 people and infecting at least 4.7 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/premature-says-china-on-chorus-for-probe-ahead-of-who-meet-into-covid-19-origin/story-zR7Tcmzpll9OGpCB57ZcGL.html

Females accounted for 55 per cent of the total cases and 53 per cent of deaths.The overall trajectory continued to be positive with no new cases being reported in six jurisdictions over the past week. Nine jurisdictions reported no new deaths in the last 24 hours. The updates provided also mentioned that “New cases continue to be reported across the country, however with a decreasing trend in daily reported cases observed.” The majority of cases (85%) and deaths (94%) continue to be reported from the provinces of Quebec and Ontario, it pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-covid-19-curve-planked/story-71hMbixCSI5I5UYR5OQY1O.html
18-05-2020||World||Japan braces for worst postwar slump as pandemic tips economy into recession||Japan’s economy slipped into recession for the first time in 4-1/2 years in the last quarter, putting the nation on course for its deepest postwar slump as the coronavirus crisis ravages businesses and consumers.Monday’s first-quarter GDP data underlined the broadening impact of the outbreak, with exports plunging the most since the devastating March 2011 earthquake as global lockdowns and supply chain disruptions hit shipments of Japanese goods.Click here for full coronavirus coverageAnalysts warn of an even bleaker picture for the current quarter as consumption crumbled after the government in April requested citizens to stay home and businesses to close, intensifying the challenge for policymakers battling a once-in-a-century pandemic.“It’s near certainty the economy suffered an even deeper decline in the current quarter,” said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute. “Japan has entered a full-blown recession.”The world’s third-largest economy contracted an annualised 3.4% in the first quarter, preliminary official gross domestic product (GDP) data showed, less than a median market forecast for a 4.6% drop.The slump came on top of an even steeper 7.3% fall in the October-December period, with the consecutive quarters of contraction meeting the technical definition of a recession. Japan last suffered recession in the second half of 2015.The coronavirus, which first emerged in China late last year, has ravaged the global economy as many nations went into strict lockdowns to curb the outbreak that has so far killed over 310,000 people worldwide. The pandemic has been massively disruptive on supply chains and businesses, particularly in trade-reliant nations such as Japan. Indeed, the fallout of the virus on corporate Japan was telling with exports diving 6.0% in the first quarter, the biggest decline since April-June 2011.“Exports to China began to fall in February, followed by a wave of slumping shipments to Europe and the United States,” said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.“Exports were also hurt by slumping inbound tourism,” which counts as a drop in non-residents’ purchases of Japanese services, he said.Deeper slump, slower recoveryThe shakeout in global trade was underlined in recent March data, with exports shrinking the most in nearly four years due to plunging U.S.-bound shipments.Even the nation’s major globe-trotting manufacturers weren’t spared the pandemic’s sweeping impact.Toyota Motor Corp has said it will cut domestic vehicle production by 122,000 units in June and expects an 80% drop in full-year operating profit.The gloom in Japan is expected to deepen over coming months.Analysts polled by Reuters estimate Japan’s economy will shrink an annualised 22.0% in the current quarter, which would be a record decline, with pressure on output intensifying after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in April declared a nationwide state of emergency amid the widening pandemic.The emergency was lifted for most regions on Thursday, but remained in effect for some big cities including Tokyo. Japan has so far reported 16,337 coronavirus cases and 756 deaths.Private consumption, which accounts for more than half of Japan’s $5 trillion economy, slipped 0.7% in January-March, less than a market forecast for a 1.6% drop, as robust demand for daily necessities partially offset the impact on services spending.All the same, it marked the second straight quarter of decline, as households endured the double-whammy of the coronavirus and a sales tax hike to 10% from 8% in October last year.Capital expenditure fell 0.5% in the first quarter after plummeting 4.8% in October-December last year, the GDP data showed, suggesting that uncertainty over the outlook is discouraging companies from boosting spending.Taken together, domestic demand knocked 0.7 percentage point off GDP growth, while external demand shed 0.2 point.All of this has put a strain on the labour market. The jobless rate in March rose to its highest in a year, while job availability slipped to a more than three-year low.The government has already announced a record $1.1 trillion stimulus package, and the Bank of Japan expanded stimulus for the second straight month in April. Abe has pledged a second supplementary budget later this month to fund fresh spending measures to cushion the economic blow from the outbreak.Still, many analysts warn that government support will come too little, too late.“As always in Japan, the implementation is very slow. It will take the later half of the second quarter (and) the third quarter” for government stimulus to kick in, said Martin Schulz, chief economist at Fujitsu.“The recovery will be slower than many are hoping for ... To recover from this crisis, it will take about two years at least.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-braces-for-worst-postwar-slump-as-pandemic-tips-economy-into-recession/story-1eXGsGHzWcFZ8AjAfcSdIP.html
18-05-2020||World||What did eight weeks and $3 trillion buy the Covid-19 in the fight against coronavirus?||Unemployment checks are flowing, $490 billion has been shipped to small businesses, and the US Federal Reserve has put about $2.5 trillion and counting behind domestic and global markets. Fears of overwhelmed hospitals and millions of US deaths from the new coronavirus have diminished, if not disappeared.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageYet two months into the United States’ fight against the most severe pandemic to arise in the age of globalization, neither the health nor the economic war has been won. Many analysts fear the country has at best fought back worst-case outcomes. For every community where case loads are declining, other hotspots arise and fester; for states like Wisconsin where bars are open and crowded, there are others such as Maryland that remain under strict limits. There is no universal, uniform testing plan to reveal what is happening to public health in any of those communities. Between 1,000 and 2,000 people a day continue to die from the Covid-19 disease in the United States, and between 20,000 and 25,000 are identified as infected.If there is consensus on any point, it is that the struggle toward normal social and economic life will take much more time, effort and money than at first thought. The risks of a years-long economic Depression have risen; fact-driven officials have become increasingly sober in their outlook; and the coming weeks and coming set of choices have emerged as critical to the future. Faced with two distinct paths - a cavalier acceptance of the mass deaths that would be needed for “herd immunity” or the truly strict lockdown needed to extinguish the virus - “we are not on either route,” Harvard University economist James Stock, among the first to model the health and economic tradeoffs the country faces, said last week.That means no clear end in sight to the economic and health pain. “I am really concerned we are just going to hang out. We will have reopened across the board, not in a smart way ... and we will have months and months of 15% or 20% unemployment,” Stock said. “It is hard to state how damaging that will be.” Taking stockTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Fed chair Jerome Powell will appear via a remote internet feed before the Senate Banking committee on Tuesday to provide the first quarterly update on implementation of the CARES Act, which along with a follow up bill formed the signature $2.9 trillion legislative response to the pandemic. They will likely face detailed questions about their efforts after a rocky few months. The Paycheck Protection Program in particular was originally overwhelmed with applicants and criticized for hundreds of loans doled out to publicly traded companies. Yet, now two months in, a replenished program still has $120 billion in funding available - money on the table that analysts at TD Securities suggest people have refused to pick up because of confusion about the terms.The hearing is also likely to be a platform for Democrats to coax Mnuchin and Powell toward acknowledging that more must be done - Powell said so directly in an appearance last week - and for Republicans arguing against quick new action. Death projections down, testing upThe lockdowns and money have had an impact on the disease’s spread, as the postponement of sporting events and other mass gatherings, and restaurant and store closings curbed the spread of a virus that some early estimates saw killing as many as 2 million Americans.Deaths as of Saturday stood at around 87,000 and are expected to pass 135,000 by early August.After federal government missteps and delays, testing has ramped up to 1.5 to 2 million tests a day, still less than half what health experts say the country needs. Strict lockdowns slowed the rate of infection in the hardest-hit areas, “flattening the curve” so hospitals could retrain nurses, cobble together donations of personal protective equipment such masks, gloves and gowns, and were spared from the direst predictions about intensive care shortages.However, the fight against the coronavirus may still be in its initial stages in more than a dozen US states, where case numbers continue to rise.And community agencies are noting increases in cases of domestic violence and suicide attempts after weeks of home confinement. Trillions more spending ahead?At its passage in late March the CARES Act was regarded as a major and perhaps sufficient prop to get the US economy through a dilemma. Fighting the spread of the virus came with a massive economic hit as stores closed, transportation networks scaled back, and tens of millions of people lost jobs or revenue at their businesses. Facing a decline not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the main goal of the bill was to replace that lost income with checks to individuals and loans to small businesses that are designed to be forgiven. JPMorgan economist Michael Feroli estimated recently that the loans and transfer payments under the act turned what would have been an annualized blow to income of nearly 60% from April through June into an annualized decline of 15% - sharp, but far more manageable. GDP in the second quarter, however, will drop 40% on an annualized basis. The budget deficit this fiscal year is expected to nearly quadruple to $3.7 trillion. Some of the deadlines in the CARES Act are approaching. The small business loans were meant to cover eight weeks of payroll, a period that has already lapsed for companies that closed in mid-March, when President Trump issued a national emergency declaration. The enhanced $600 per week unemployment benefit expires at the end of July.The House on Friday passed a new $3 trillion CARES Act to replenish some funding, but it is unclear whether the Republican-led Senate will take it up. Weeks after a V-shaped economic recovery was predicted in March, most economists and health officials have a darker message.  “It is quite possible this thing will stay at how ever many deaths it is a day indefinitely, just wobbling up and down a little bit as epidemics move to different places around the country,” said economist and Princeton University professor Angus Deaton. “The sort of social distancing we are prepared to put up with is not going to do very much.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-did-eight-weeks-and-3-trillion-buy-the-covid-19-in-the-fight-against-coronavirus/story-XR8EgPTcfMGRg3RCkS8H7O.html

A special chartered flight will take them to Punjab’s Amritsar. Among those on the list to be deported, the maximum 76 are from Haryana, followed by 56 from Punjab; 12 from Gujarat; five from Uttar Pradesh; four from Maharashtra ; two each from Kerala, Telengana and Tamil Nadu; and each from Andhra Pradesh and Goa. According to Satnam Singh Chahal, executive director, North American Punjabi Association (NAPA), they are from among the 1,739 Indians languishing in 95 jails across the US. They were arrested by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE while trying to enter the United States illegally. According to an ICE report, the US deported 611 Indian nationals in 2018, which rose over two-and-a-half times to 1,616 in 2019. NAPA said among the 161 to be deported to India, three are women. The youngest of them are two 19-year-old youths from Haryana.“The fate of the remaining Indians languishing in the US jails is still unknown,” Chahal said. Though there is no data to show from which Indian states those languishing in the US jails came, most of them are believed to be from North India. Most detainees had asked for an asylum, claiming that they experienced violence or persecution in their home country. Over the past a few years, US judges did not buy their argument and dismissed their applications. Chahal, who has been working among them for years, alleged that there is a nexus of human traffickers and officials in north India, especially Punjab, who encourage young people to leave their homes and illegally enter the US. These middlemen and agents charge Rs 35-50 lakh from each individual. In a statement, Chahal urged the Punjab government and the Centre to take action against illegal agents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-to-deport-161-indian-nationals-this-week/story-5W0BrjdMWeltNfQa1srHBO.html

The Trump’s reaction came after Obama on Saturday criticised the US authorities’ response to the coronavirus outbreak. “He (Obama) was an incompetent president. That’s all I can say. Grossly incompetent,” Trump told reporters at the White House on his arrival from Camp David. Trump was responding to a question on the virtual commencement address by Obama a day earlier. In his address to college graduates, Obama had said that the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the American leadership. “More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing,” Obama said without naming officials.  “A lot of them aren’t even pretending to be in charge,” he added. There was no immediate response from the office of the former president on the remarks made by Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/grossly-incompetent-trump-criticises-predecessor-obama-after-criticism-over-covid-19/story-bDGBYqdrhT460mvi7JnGrJ.html

Other government statistics which include deaths due to suspected cases indicate that Britain’s toll is over 40,000.Sharma said 243,303 people in Britain had so far tested positive for the virus, an increase of 3,142 since Saturday.Sharma also said that Oxford University and drug maker AstraZeneca had struck a global licensing deal for a vaccine that Oxford scientists were working on, one of the front runners in the global race to provide protection against the new coronavirus causing the Covid-19 pandemic.If the vaccine proves successful, AstraZeneca will mass produce 100 million doses with up to 30 million doses available for people in the United Kingdom by September.“The UK will be first to get access,” Sharma said, adding that the government was providing an additional 84 million pounds ($101.67 million) in funding to British researchers working on potential vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-by-170-lowest-increase-since-march/story-RkdBLYk45em3TWwoEWxtEN.html

18-05-2020||World||Afghan president and rival strike power-sharing deal after months of feuding||Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah signed a power-sharing deal to end a months-long political stalemate, Ghani’s spokesman said on Sunday, a step that could smooth efforts to end the country’s long-running war.Abdullah had disputed the results of an election in September and announced the formation of a parallel government earlier this year, undermining Ghani’s administration at a time when the United States was trying to advance a peace process with the Taliban to end the 19-year Afghan war. “Today is a historic day for our dear Afghanistan. Afghans have proven that they are committed to their national interests with common thinking,” Ghani said during the signing ceremony.“In the coming days, we hope that with unity and cooperation, we will be able to provide the ground for a ceasefire and lasting peace,” he added.Discussions over the final sticking points including the allocation of some key posts had been underway throughout the day, three sources said.Abdullah had wanted to control a major portfolio such as finance or foreign affairs, and while Ghani has not agreed to this, he could offer control of the interior ministry, sources said shortly before the deal was signed. It was not immediately clear which ministries each camp controlled after the agreement was struck.Washington has been frustrated by the growing impasse between the two men, even after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo travelled to Kabul in March to mediate. It had announced a plan to cut $1 billion in aid because the men could not agree.Pompeo welcomed the agreement but chided Ghani and Abdullah for taking so long. He said the United States looked forward to prompt intra-Afghan talks and a political settlement.“Secretary Pompeo noted that he regretted the time lost during the political impasse,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.It was not clear whether Sunday’s agreement would result in the aid commitment being reinstated. Afghanistan is facing growing fiscal pressures, with tax revenues falling and foreign aid pledges due this year expected to shrink.“Please reconsider your potential $1 billion aid cut. In fact, since we have the COVID-19 pandemic, add more to it. Thank you,” Shamroz Khan Masjidi, a spokesman for the ministry of finance said on Twitter, tagging the Secretary of State.The State Department did not immediately comment on the aid cut.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also welcomed the deal and called on the Taliban to reduce violence and for all sides to work towards peace.Officials say a deal between Ghani and Abdullah is crucial to launching peace talks, as Abdullah’s camp represents much of the country’s north-west.But the talks face a number of stark challenges, as violence in the country increases. An attack on a Kabul maternity ward this week prompted Ghani to switch the military to an “offensive” stance against insurgent groups.The Taliban has denied involvement in the attack, but the government has remained sceptical and angry at ongoing Taliban attacks against the Afghan military, fraying the momentum for peace talks, which were due to start in March.US Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said on Friday that a new date for intra-Afghan peace talks was under discussion, and that he would soon travel to the region and try to encourage a reduction in violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-president-and-rival-strike-power-sharing-deal-after-months-of-feuding/story-DZxsn694gAsDt3KUdJyC9J.html
18-05-2020||World||US economy may begin to recover by summer, will likely be slow: Federal Reserve Chairman||Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed optimism Sunday that the U.S. economy can begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn’t erupt in a second wave. But he suggested that a full recovery won’t likely be possible before the arrival of a vaccine.In an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes,” Powell noted that the economy was fundamentally healthy before the virus struck suddenly and forced widespread business shutdowns and tens of millions of layoffs. Once the outbreak has been contained, he said, the economy should be able to rebound “substantially.”Powell offered an overall positive message while warning that it would take much longer for the economy to regain its health than it took for it to collapse with stunning speed.“In the long run, and even in the medium run,” the chairman said, “you wouldn’t want to bet against the American economy. This economy will recover. And that means people will go back to work. Unemployment will get back down. We’ll get through this.”Powell pointed out that the downturn wasn’t a result of deep-seated financial instabilities, like the housing meltdown and the excessive risk-taking among banks that ignited the Great Recession. Rather, it resulted from an external event — a pandemic — that required a shutdown of the economy. That may mean, he said, that “we can get back to a healthy economy fairly quickly.”In the meantime, though, American workers are enduring their worst crisis in decades. More than 36 million people have applied for unemployment benefits in the two months since the coronavirus first forced businesses to close down and shrink their workforces. The unemployment rate, at 14.7%, is the highest since the Great Depression, and is widely expected to go much higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-economy-may-begin-to-recover-by-summer-will-likely-be-slow-federal-reserve-chairman/story-3DZqC6oYBTKPhLjDHFYgjO.html
18-05-2020||World||One dead after Canadian jet crashes during flyover to boost morale during Covid-19||A Canadian acrobatic jet crashed into a British Columbia neighborhood Sunday during a flyover intended to boost morale during the pandemic, killing one crew member, seriously injuring another and setting a house on fire. Video appeared to show at least one person ejecting.The crash left debris scattered across the neighborhood near the airport in the city of Kamloops, 260 miles (418 kilometers) northeast of Vancouver. Canada’s defense department said emergency crews were responding. The Snowbirds are Canada’s equivalent of the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds or U.S. Navy’s Blue Angels.“It is with heavy hearts that we announce that one member of the CF Snowbirds team has died and one has sustained serious injuries,” The Royal Canadian Air Force said in a tweet.Rose Miller lives directly across the street from where the plane hit. She’d watched the Snowbirds arrive on Saturday, and she went to her front window when she heard the roar of jet engines.Miller said she heard a loud bang and wondered whether it might be a sonic boom. Then she watched the plane smash onto the ground.“It looked to me like it was mostly on the road, but it just exploded. It went everywhere,” she said. “In fact, I got a big, huge piece in my backyard. The cops said it was the ejection seat.”Miller said a couple in their early 70s lives in the home. Both are OK, she said, noting that she’d spoken with them after they were evacuated to a nearby street. The woman had been in the basement while the man was behind the house.Miller said section of roof on a home on a nearby street has been covered up.Video posted to Twitter by 6:10 a.m. in Kamloops appears to show two Snowbirds taking off from what is believed to have been Kamloops Airport. One of the aircraft subsequently climbed into the sky before rolling over and plunging to the ground. The video appears to show at least one person ejecting from the plane before it disappears behind a stand of trees and an explosion is heard.“Our number one priority at this time is determining the status of our personnel, the community and supporting emergency personnel. When appropriate, more information will be made available,” the Department of National Defense said in a statement.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the cause of the crash is under investigation.Kenny Hinds, who lives in a house seven doors down from the crash site, said it looked like the living room of the house where the crash occurred was on fire.“I just started running down the street. And I got there maybe a minute after it crashed and there was a couple of residents that had their hoses out and they were trying to put the flames out because it hit a house,” he said. “It looked like most of it landed in the front yard, but maybe a wing or something went through the roof perhaps.”Hinds had been watching the aircraft after hearing them take off, and said he was able to see the crash and saw “the Snowbird going straight down.”“I saw what looked like a parachute about, say, 20 feet over the house, and it disappeared from sight, and the parachute hadn’t fully deployed yet — it was still sort of straight up and down,” he said.Operation Inspiration started in Nova Scotia earlier this month and features the team’s signature nine-jet formation. It was aimed at boosting morale amid the pandemic.Marni Capostinsky said she lives across the street from the crash site and was out on the deck when she heard the plane getting closer.“We ran out under the cover to look and saw something black coming towards us, everyone hit the deck it was so loud,” she said.Sunday’s crash follows the downing of another Snowbird in the U.S. state of Georgia last October, where the team was scheduled to perform in an air show. Capt. Kevin Domon-Grenier sustained minor injuries when he ejected from the plane, which crashed into a farmer’s field. No one else was hurt.The Snowbirds have performed at airshows across Canada and the U.S. for decades and are considered a key tool for raising awareness about — and recruiting for — the air force. Eleven aircraft are used during shows, with nine flying and two kept as spares.The air force obtained its Tutor jets in 1963 and has used them in air demonstrations since 1971. Prior to Sunday’s crash, seven pilots and one passenger had been killed and several aircraft had been lost over the course of the Snowbirds’ history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-dead-after-canadian-jet-crashes-during-flyover-to-boost-morale-during-covid-19/story-pgRxIArW47HXXcak2MiY1K.html
18-05-2020||World||Chinese ambassador to Israel found dead in home: Officials||The Chinese ambassador to Israel was found dead in his home north of Tel Aviv on Sunday, Israel’s Foreign Ministry said.Israeli Police Spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the ambassador’s death was believed to be from natural causes.Du Wei, 58, was appointed envoy in February in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. He previously served as China’s envoy to Ukraine. He was found dead at the ambassador’s official residence in Herzliya.He is survived by a wife and son, both of whom were not in Israel.Israel enjoys good relations with China. Bilateral trade has grown in recent years, as have American concerns over Chinese investment, and concerns over spying on one of its key regional allies.The ambassador’s death came just two days after he condemned comments by visiting U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who denounced Chinese investments in Israel and accused China of hiding information about the coronavirus outbreak.Pompeo told Hebrew-language daily Israel Hayom that the U.S. and Israel have an opportunity to “build upon our relationship rather than give the Chinese Community Party the opportunity to undermine it.”The Chinese Embassy published an op-ed in the Jerusalem Post on Thursday rebuffing Pompeo’s claims that China was responsible for the outbreak and American concerns about Chinese investment in Israel.“We trust that the Jewish friends are not only able to defeat the coronavirus but also the ‘political virus,’ and choose the course of action that best serves its interests,” the embassy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-ambassador-to-israel-found-dead-in-home-officials/story-x5H1JoT8MtrlHyL4ZTTmNJ.html
18-05-2020||World||New York City widens testing eligibility as social distancing hits snag||New York City residents who flouted social distancing restrictions for a night on the town got the mayor’s wrath Sunday. The city’s embattled health commissioner is staying on the job. Gov. Andrew Cuomo played the part of a model patient, getting swabbed for coronavirus on live TV as he announced all people experiencing flu-like symptoms are now eligible for testing.Meanwhile, two more state regions — Western New York and the Capital District — have met criteria to move into the first phase of reopening but still need to hire several hundred more people for contact tracing programs.In the first phase, construction, agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, manufacturing and wholesale trade businesses are allowed to reopen and retail stores can provide curbside or in-store pickup or drop-off.Here are the latest coronavirus-related developments in New York:SATURDAY NIGHT FERVORNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio admonished people seen crowding outside bars Saturday night — many with drinks in hand but no masks on their faces — for putting lives in danger. Officials may shut down establishments that break distancing rules, de Blasio said.City bars and restaurants have been restricted to takeout and delivery since mid-March, when coronavirus cases started to soar, but some in Manhattan were allowing people to dine and drink inside on Saturday.“We’re not going to tolerate people starting to congregate. It’s as simple as that,” de Blasio said. “If we have to shut places down, we will.”After a rash of violent social distancing arrests involving people of color, the city this week eased distancing enforcement by no longer having police break up small groups of people or confront citizens failing to wear a mask.As the weather heats up, though, more and more New Yorkers are flocking to public spaces and familiar haunts for a sense of normalcy after spending most of the last two months cooped up inside — and not always policing themselves.Parks, boardwalks and beaches attracted big crowds on Saturday, though city beaches aren’t officially open and won’t be for Memorial Day weekend.Other beaches in the region will be open for the holiday, but de Blasio said opening the city’s strands “is not the right thing to do in the epicenter of this crisis.”The city’s beaches could be closed off completely to public access if people don’t follow social distancing rules, he said. Fences being installed at entrances could be rolled out if beaches — meant now only for nearby residents to exercise — get overcrowded or people violate swimming bans, he said.De Blasio said beaches could open for wider use sometime in the summer, with lifeguard training over the next few weeks for a possible return to duty.GLUT OF TESTING CAPACITYAll New Yorkers experiencing flu-like symptoms or other coronavirus signs, such as dry cough or chest pains, are now eligible to be tested, along with people who returning to work as part of phased reopenings, Cuomo said Sunday.The state is expanding eligibility as it deals with a surplus of testing capacity. Drive-thru and walk-in testing sites are performing about one-third of the 15,000 tests they’re capable of each day, Cuomo said.An agreement with CVS will allow samples to be collected at more than 60 of the chain’s pharmacies across the state, Cuomo said. Testing in New York City is being expanded to 123 CityMD walk-in clinics.De Blasio also made an urgent appeal Sunday for blood donations, saying supplies have dwindled to about two days’ worth because of blood drive cancellations, which could mean postponing some surgeries.HEALTH CHIEF TO STAYDe Blasio is standing by his health commissioner after a report she used crass language in a March phone call with a top police commander about supplies of protective face masks. Several police unions and a congressman called for Dr. Oxiris Barbot’s firing.Barbot has been absent from de Blasio’s recent news conferences and her department was bypassed last week in favor of the city’s public hospital system to run a contact tracing program, fueling questions about a possible rift.De Blasio said Sunday that he has spoken with Barbot “to clear the air on some of the recent issues” and that she would remain in the role she’s held since 2018.“We’re going to move forward together,” de Blasio said.Barbot caught heat this week for a previously unreported clash with NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan, who wanted more masks for officers.The New York Post, citing an anonymous source, reported Wednesday that Barbot retorted, “I don’t give two rats’ asses about your cops.” The newspaper didn’t say what Monahan said to prompt that response.A health department spokesman said Thursday that Barbot apologized to the chief for her contribution to “a heated exchange between the two where things were said out of frustration, but no harm was wished on anyone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-widens-testing-eligibility-as-social-distancing-hits-snag/story-9l2pWR9jyieAbXWzCvEh9K.html
18-05-2020||World||13 hurt in Louisiana memorial service shooting, no casualty||Thirteen people were shot Saturday night as a large group gathered in a Louisiana city for an impromptu memorial service for a man whose body was found earlier this month, authorities said.No one was killed, but one person was in critical condition after the 9:15 p.m. shooting in Bogalusa, police said.The crowd was gathered in a vacant lot to remember Dominique James, who was missing for several days before being found dead May 8 inside his vehicle in woods by officers in a helicopter, investigators said.“The best we can tell is a car drove by and shots were fired and it was pure chaos from there,” Bogalusa Police Maj. Troy Tervalon told The Associated Press.Police haven’t had a witness come forward to give them a better description of the shooting and have made no arrests, Tervalon said.James’ family had asked Bogalusa officials if they could have a regular memorial service for James, but were turned down because of stay-at-home orders with COVID-19, Tervalon said.The gathering of at least 150 people Saturday night were mostly friends, Tervalon said.The scene was so chaotic, with wounded people being taken to several different hospitals that investigators haven’t been able to find and interview all the wounded people, Tervalon said.James was last heard from heading to an unknown location to pick up an all-terrain vehicle on May 2, police said.His death is considered a homicide, but Tervalon said he didn’t want to release any additional details. No arrests have been made in that case.Bogalusa is a city of about 12,000 people and is 70 miles (113 kilometers) northeast of New Orleans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/13-hurt-in-louisiana-memorial-service-shooting-no-casualty/story-vi4L5oLvjR2zLCASJ8F4bJ.html
