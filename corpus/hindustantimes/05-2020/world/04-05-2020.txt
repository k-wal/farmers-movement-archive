After the pilot of the “test, track and trace procedures” on the island, the app is expected to be made more widely available to the British public later this month.“This trial does not mean the end of social distancing on the Isle of Wight or anywhere else,” Hancock stressed, as he appealed to everyone living in that region to download the app.From among the questions from members of the public at the briefing, the minister was also asked about the steps being taken by the government to protect black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) staff within the NHS after reports of them being at higher risk from Covid-19.“We recognise that there has been a disproportionately high rate of deaths among BAME care workers,” said Hancock, adding that work is on to understand it scientifically. Jonathan Van-Tam, the Deputy Chief Medical Office for England, added that the NHS is taking this “incredibly seriously”.“A large programme of work has been put in place… the NHS will get to the bottom of this,” he said.The government launched a review into the disparity in death rates from Covid-19 among BAME communities, including Indians, last month. One hypothesis is that people from BAME communities have higher rates of underlying health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension, and this may increase their vulnerability and risk. The Research and Innovation Forum of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO) has been among the many medical associations lobbying the government for steps to protect this vulnerable category of the NHS workforce. NHS England recently advised hospital trusts to make “appropriate arrangements” to ensure BAME doctors and nurses are shielded as best as possible on the job, including being given less frontline roles in the pandemic fightback.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-pilot-coronavirus-contact-tracing-smartphone-app/story-QcaMTDJhMsMdFeyq6monBP.html
04-05-2020||World||Donald Trump pledges ‘conclusive’ report on China, ups US toll projection to 100k||President Donald Trump has promised a “conclusive” report on the US investigation into Chinas handling of the coronavirus outbreak and he once against revised projections for US toll, which he said, could now hit 100,000.“We’re going to be giving a very strong report as to exactly what we think happened. And I think it will be very conclusive,” Trump said a “virtual town hall” hosted Sunday by Fox News. “My opinion is they made a mistake. They tried to cover it, they tried to put it out., just like a fire.”The US has disputed the Chinese version of the origin of Covid-19 — from a meats and fresh produce market in Wuhan — and alleged it started instead at a virology lab in the same city. And it has also accused Beijing of delaying alerting the rest of the world and of suppressing the true extent of its epidemic.Secretary of state Mike Pompeo has said the US has “enormous evidence” of the outbreak began at the Wuhan lab. He has not shared any evidence, and neither has any US official thus far, despite continued and rising rhetoric against China, with threats of punitive measures, including making China pay for it.China has dismissed these allegations and called them last Thursday an effort by the Trump administration to “shift their own responsibility for the poor handling of the epidemic”.The Trump administration has indeed faced questions about its response to the epidemic, essentially for squandering time gained by the earlyFebruary ban on travelers from China. The president has pushed back and insisted he was, in fact, ahead of the curve, citing the same travel restrictions.At the Fox New town hall, the president sought to shift the blame somewhat on to Anthony Fauci, a top epidemiologist and member of the president’s task force on the outbreak — “everybody, even Tony Fauci, was saying it’s going to pass, not going to be a big deal”.It did not. And the United States has borne the brunt of the pandemic with 1.15 million confirmed and reported infections till Monday morning, a third of the cases worldwide; and 67,710 fatalities, close to a quarter or the global toll. The US numbers went up in the last 24 hours 25,501 infections and 1,313 deaths.President Trump said the town hall he fears the fatalities will go up further, revising upwards his earlier assessments. “We’re going to lose anywhere from 75-, 80- to 100,000 people,” Trump said. “That’s a horrible thing. We shouldn’t lose one person over this. This should’ve been stopped in China.”The president had last week that the toll will “hopefully” wind up under 100,000, changing his earlier assessments of 240,000 way back in March before issuing lockdown guidelines to 60,000 and 70,000 in recent days and weeks, as he has sought to frame the reducing numbers as an achievement.Without the mitigation measures ordered by him the numbers would have been far higher, he has argued.Even at 100,000, his new projection, is way in excess of the 72,433 Covid-19 deaths projected by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), whose modeling and numbers have been cited often by the Whit House. The IHME projected number if for August, at the current levels of mitigation.With many states rolling back restrictions and reopening some businesses, with the very public backing of the president, experts fear a resurgence, specially those that ignore the federal reopening guidelines and and end up “leapfrogging” conditions laid down for graduating from one phase to another.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-pledges-conclusive-report-on-china-ups-us-toll-projection-to-100k/story-scpxyOMIV54Bpj91dRCWMM.html

It is one among seven new Nightingale hospitals across the UK. There has been a sustained fall in cases, particularly in the hotspot of London in recent days.As of Sunday evening, the UK-wide cumulative death toll was 28,446, with 186,599 cases, and 14,248 people currently in hospitals. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week that the UK is now “past the peak”.A Downing Street spokesman said on Monday that the Nightingale hospital in London was put on ‘standby’ due to limited demand: “It’s not likely that in the coming days we will need to be admitting patients to the London Nightingale while coronavirus in the capital remains under control”.“That’s obviously a very positive thing and we remain grateful to everybody in London for following the government’s advice in helping to protect the NHS. What the Nightingale will be is effectively placed on standby so it would be ready to receive patients should that be required, but we are not anticipating that will be the case.”Similar mega hospitals have been set up in Manchester, Birmingham, Harrogate and Bristol, with two more due to open shortly in Sunderland and Exeter.The spokesman said: “Manchester has taken some patients already; Birmingham, Harrogate and Bristol are ready to take patients if needed…People followed the advice to stay at home, that’s slowed the rate of infection and meant that the NHS wasn’t overwhelmed.”The UK’s hospital system not being overwhelmed by the pandemic is one of the five tests the government has set before easing lockdown restrictions are considered. The others are: that the daily death rate falls sustainably and consistently; that the rate of infection is falling; that the operational challenges have been met’ and most importantly, that there is no risk of a second peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/falling-covid-19-cases-in-uk-puts-mega-hospital-on-standby/story-yPhhEte8SishOliN9jtoUK.html
04-05-2020||World||Donald Trump predicts Covid-19 vaccine by year end||President Donald Trump on Sunday said he believes a vaccine for Covid-19 will have been found by the end of the year, further shortening the timeline by weeks of even the most optimistic projections for a time-consuming complex process that experts have insisted can take 12 to 18 months.“We think we are going to have a vaccine by the end of this year,” the president said t a virtual town-hall hosted by Fox News Sunday evening at the Lincoln Memorial.He acknowledged straightaway the over-the-top optimism in his assessment. “The doctors would say, ‘Well, you shouldn’t say that’. I’ll say what I think,” he said, adding, “I think we’re going to have a vaccine much sooner than later.”The president went to name the Johnson & Johnson vaccine candidate, which is slated to start human trials in September. A drug from Moderna went under Phase One trial in Washington state in March and has a long way to go.The Trump administration has launched an ambitious Manhattan Project-style effort called “Operation Warp Speed” to speed up the hunt for the vaccine in a private-public partnership. It is reported to have narrowed down the search from an estimated 93 to 14, with plans to further pare it down to seven, and then to 3 or four for final clinical trials in January.Trump’s own top medical advisers have offered January as their most optimistic outlook. “Remember, go back in time, I was saying in January and February that it would be a year to 18 months (to develop a vaccine), so January is a year, so it isn’t that much from what I had originally said,” Anthony Fauci, a top epidemiologist and member of the president’s coronavirus task force told told CBS news last week.And he prefaced that with aa notable qualifier. .”I think that is doable if things fall in the right place.”Deborah Birx, coordinator of the task force, has reservedly agreed January is “doable on paper”. She has also said, reflecting the magnitude of the challenge, “We make forward progress in vaccines and then a little step backwards and then forward progress.”The Trump administration has been eager to get ahead of the epidemic as it faces continued criticism for being slow to respond and the president has sought to project optimism with misleading projections of toll that he has revised upwards several times and by touting untested cures and therapeutics such as the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, which his own drug regulators has since cautioned against, citing side-effects.As the race for a vaccine continues globally, questions have been raised about safety, specially of volunteers participating in these fast-tracked efforts. “No, because they are volunteers. They know what they’re getting into,” the president said when asked if he worried bout it. “They’re in many cases very good people. They want to help the process. Look, a vaccine has never gone like it’s gone now.”“We’re so far ahead of any vaccine ever in history. These things would take two, four, five, six years,” Trump went on to say.It may take even longer, and indefinitely. A vaccine fr HIV has remained elusive 40 years since the search began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-predicts-covid-19-vaccine-by-year-end/story-oI4JKfaBv0wTpVABNdQYaK.html

We will use contact tracing, a well-established public health intervention, to identify the close contacts of those cases, who may have had the disease transmitted to them”.“We will ask and support those close contacts to self-isolate, so that if they do develop the disease, there is less risk that they will pass it on to others. And we will make sure that support is available to enable people to isolate effectively”.However, Sturgeon stressed that the TTI approach will be most effective when levels of infection are low and stay low, adding that its success relies on people knowing and agreeing what to do when symptoms emerge, and being prepared to self-isolate when advised to do so.Johnson is due to reveal a ‘roadmap’ out of the lockdown on Sunday, which reportedly includes measures to minimise employees using equipment, stagger shift times and maximise home-working, according to a leaked draft.But the UK must not lift restrictions too soon, only when its five tests are met, he said in a video message on Monday, adding: “The worst thing we could do now is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of coronavirus.” The five tests are: That the National Health Service can continue to cope; that the daily death rate falls sustainably and consistently; that the rate of infection is falling; that the operational challenges have been met’ and most importantly, that there is no risk of a second peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/test-trace-isolate-scotland-reveals-tti-strategy-to-ease-lockdown/story-E6uX0HeXiHu7oP8ERuYdCL.html
04-05-2020||World||Global markets drop, spooked by China-US row over Covid-19||Shares took a turn for the worse on Monday as tensions between the Trump administration and China over the origins and handling of the coronavirus pandemic rattled investors.Benchmarks fell in most markets except for Australia, which was lifted by signs its own virus outbreak is being brought under control. India’s Sensex plunged nearly 6% as authorities extended their pandemic-fighting lockdown for another two weeks and new data showed an unprecedented drop in factory activity.Germany’s DAX dropped 3.3% to 10,507.33 and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 4% to 4,389.97. Britain’s FTSE 100 declined 0.5% to 5,735.00. The future for the S&P 500 slipped 1.1% and that for the Dow industrials lost 1.2%, pointing to a lower open on Wall Street.Tokyo, Shanghai and Bangkok were among markets closed for holidays. Stocks had closed broadly lower on Wall Street on Friday after Amazon and other big companies reported disappointing results.Criticized over his handling of the crisis, President Donald Trump has tried to shift the blame to China. Beijing has repeatedly pushed back on U.S. accusations that the outbreak was China’s fault.The antagonisms threaten to undo the truce in a trade war between Washington and Beijing that was struck just before China began shutting much of its economy down in late January to fight the pandemic.A 4-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press contends that Chinese leaders “intentionally concealed the severity” of the pandemic from the world in early January.It alleges, citing variances in trade patterns, that China was downplaying the severity of its outbreak, first reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, while stockpiling medical supplies.“The renewed possibility of the return of the trade war that had plagued markets since at least 2017 once again weighed on sentiment,” Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary.Tensions over the pandemic and threats to hit back with trade sanctions have amped up risk, Mizuho Bank said in a report.“Even as growth-stifling containment measures are set to be phased out in May, the global downturn looks to deepen in Q2,” it said, adding that anti-China threats from Trump, on top of record job losses, may result in a continuation of the “Mayday” type of fear dynamics.There is no public evidence of an intentional plot to buy up the world’s medical supplies, though China did muzzle doctors who warned of the virus early on. But it informed the World Health Organization of the outbreak on Dec. 31; contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Jan. 3 and publicly identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus on Jan. 8. Many of its missteps appear to have stemmed from bureaucratic hurdles.Wall Street has been bracing for a poor showing by companies this earnings season due to the economic shock from the coronavirus. Many companies have pulled their earnings guidance for the rest of the year, citing uncertainty about how much of an impact the outbreak will have on their business and the economy, which is now in a recession.Bleak trade and manufacturing data are also discouraging investors on the lookout for upbeat news on steps to stop the pandemic and prevent a resurgence in cases in places that are beginning to reopen after shutdowns.Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index fell 4.2% to 23,613.80 on Monday. The Kospi in South Korea dropped 2.7% to 1,895.37. Shares also fell by more than 2% in Singapore, Taiwan and Jakarta.Australia’s S&P ASX/200 gained 1.4% to 5,320.30, rebounding from early losses on gains in miners and banks.The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged lower, to 0.60% from 0.62% on Friday, well below its 1.90% level at the start of the year.Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell $1.39 to $18.39 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gained 94 cents on Friday to $19.78 per barrel. U.S. crude has plunged from its perch of roughly $60 at the start of the year on worries about a collapse in demand and strained storage facilities. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 56 cents to $25.88 per barrel.The dollar fetched 106.74 Japanese yen, down from 106.88 yen on Friday. The euro weakened to $1.0939 from $1.0980.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-markets-drop-spooked-by-china-us-row-over-covid-19/story-5ZHVVYGveiI4Z0HFiClr3I.html

Security Council arms embargo on Tehran, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Monday. “Iran is not seeking to exit the 2015 nuclear deal with six powers ... America’s move is illegitimate and our reaction will be proportionate,” Abbas Mousavi said in a televised weekly news conference.The United States said on Thursday it was “hopeful” the U.N. Security Council would extend the arms embargo on Iran before it expires in October. President Donald Trump’s administration has been taking a harder line with the United Nations over its desire to extend and strengthen the embargo on Iran.Washington has threatened to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran as leverage to get backing from the 15-member Security Council on extending the U.N. arms embargo on Tehran.“The United States is not a member of the nuclear deal anymore ... Iran’s reaction to America’s illegal measures will be firm,” Mousavi said.Trump withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Tehran that have crippled its economy.Under the deal, Iran agreed to halt its sensitive nuclear work in exchange for sanctions relief. Iran, which denies its nuclear program is aimed at building a bomb, has gradually rolled back its commitments under the accord since the United States quit. It argues that Washington’s actions justify such a course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-us-push-to-extend-tehran-s-arms-embargo-is-illegitimate/story-VF8A9wE45fp74BSYOa8GTN.html
04-05-2020||World||US Supreme Court hears first case by teleconference; Thomas asks questions||In a break from tradition caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday for the first time heard arguments in a case by teleconference - a trademark dispute involving popular hotel reservation website Booking.com - and even typically silent Justice Clarence Thomas asked questions.The nine justices kicked off a scheduled hour of arguments in the case - not in a courtroom but by participating remotely using a dial-in format to combat the spread of the pathogen.Emphasizing the unique nature of the proceedings, Thomas, a conservative justice who almost never asks questions during arguments, embraced the new format and queried government lawyer Erica Ross about her arguments on behalf of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeking to prevent Booking.com from trademarking the site’s name.He asked whether trademarking a website name would be similar to trademarking a 1-800 phone number. Thomas, as the longest serving justice, asked his questions after Chief Justice John Roberts, his voice echoing on the line, asked his own questions of Ross.Early on, the technology seemed to be working well, with each justice taking turns asking questions in order of seniority.When it was Justice Stephen Breyer’s turn, he launched into his question before checking himself.“Good morning, anyway,” he said.The justices over the next two weeks are set to conduct arguments in 10 cases by teleconference. In another first, the court is providing a live audio feed, making these the first arguments that the public can hear live. Cable TV network C-SPAN said it plans to broadcast that feed in all the cases.Rather than the wide-open questioning exhibited during typical cases in the justices’ ornate courtroom, the court has tweaked the format for the teleconference arguments so justices will take turn asking questions in order of seniority.Booking.com, a unit of Norwalk, Connecticut-based Booking Holdings Inc, along with the rest of the travel industry, has been slammed by the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused tourism and business travel to evaporate worldwide.The Patent and Trademark Office is appealing a lower court decision allowing the trademark because by adding “.com” to the generic word “booking” it became eligible for a trademark. The online reservation service filed several trademark applications in 2011 and 2012.A Patent and Trademark Office tribunal in 2016 rejected those applications, saying Booking.com referred generically to the common meaning of booking lodging and transportation and cannot be used exclusively through a federal trademark registration. Under U.S. law, only terms that distinguish a particular product or service from others on the market can be trademarked.Booking.com appealed, presenting a survey that showed that 74% of consumers identified Booking.com as a brand name. The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the company last year because the name as a whole is understood by the public to refer to a business.The court will hear arguments on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of this week and the same days next week. The biggest cases to be considered by teleconference are three that focus on the question of whether President Donald Trump can keep his financial records including tax returns secret. Those cases will be argued on May 12.The Supreme Court building has been closed to the public since March 13 due to the pandemic. The justices have met only via teleconference, and have issued rulings only online.The coronavirus has proven to be particularly dangerous in elderly people, especially those with underlying medical issues. Three of the nine justices are over age 70: Ginsburg (87), Breyer (81) and Thomas (71).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-historic-first-us-supreme-court-to-be-broadcast-live/story-27ur18BxNf41kqS4lL5YiP.html
04-05-2020||World||US has very ‘conclusive’ report on Covid-19’s China origins, says Trump||President Donald Trump promised a “conclusive” report from the U.S. government on the Chinese origins of the coronavirus outbreak, adding that he has little doubt that Beijing misled the world about the scale and risk of the disease before it became a global pandemic.“We will be giving a very strong report on what we think happened, and I think it will be very conclusive,” Trump said during a “virtual town hall” hosted by Fox News on Sunday, after he was asked about evidence the virus is related to research conducted in a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.“Personally, I think they made a very horrible mistake,” Trump said of the Chinese. “They tried to cover it, they tried to put it out.”The White House’s deputy national security adviser, Matt Pottinger, is scheduled to speak on the U.S. relationship with China on Monday in a webinar hosted by the University of Virginia’s Miller Center.Earlier Sunday, the Associated Press reported that U.S. officials believe China covered up the extent of the outbreak, in part, to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it.The president’s comments come as U.S.-China tensions climb amid the rising death toll from the virus in the U.S., which has the highest reported numbers of infections and deaths of any country, despite the outbreak first spreading more quickly in Asia and Europe. More than 67,000 people have died from the virus in the U.S. so far, out of a reported 247,000 worldwide.Earlier in the day, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said “enormous evidence” shows the Covid-19 outbreak began in the Wuhan laboratory, but didn’t provide any proof for his claims.“I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan,” Pompeo said on ABC’s “This Week.” “These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab.”While the Wuhan Institute of Virology was studying bat-borne coronaviruses like the one that causes Covid-19 at the time of the first known outbreak nearby, there has so far been no evidence showing it possessed the previously unknown strain. Yuan Zhiming, director of the facility’s high-security Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, said last month that “there is absolutely no way that the virus originated from our institute.”Pompeo stopped short of saying the virus was man-made, noting that he agreed with a report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that ruled out genetic modification of the pathogen.“I’ve seen what the intelligence community has said,” Pompeo said. “I have no reason to believe that they’ve got it wrong.”Pompeo declined to say whether the Chinese intentionally released the virus. “I don’t have anything to say about that,” he said.‘Strong’ LeaderIn his town hall event Sunday, Trump declined to directly criticize Chinese President Xi Jinping, calling him a “strong” leader who he struck a trade deal with just as the outbreak was spreading.“I’m not going to say anything,” Trump responded when asked about Xi. “I had a very good relationship with him.”Although China has reprimanded Wuhan police for punishing doctors who sounded early warnings about the disease and replaced local officials responsible for the initial outbreak, Beijing says its response has been open and transparent. China’s foreign ministry has cited Trump’s tweets praising Xi’s handling of the outbreak as evidence of U.S. satisfaction with its response.Trump and his aides sharpened their criticism of Beijing last week, demanding answers about the virus’s origin. The president tweeted Friday that some U.S. television networks were “Chinese puppets,” while his super-political action committee unleashed anti-China ads.“China behaved like authoritarian regimes do, attempted to conceal and hide and confuse,” Pompeo said on ABC. “It employed the World Health Organization as a tool to do the same.”The secretary said China continued to block access by health experts from the WHO, as well as U.S. scientists, from getting access to samples of the virus needed for study.“This is an ongoing threat, an ongoing pandemic,” Pompeo said. “The Chinese Communist Party continues to block access to the Western world, the world’s best scientists, to figure out exactly what happened.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-us-has-very-conclusive-report-on-coronavirus-s-china-origins/story-7Kp8cf7g3ExSTKgzvWpVtL.html

04-05-2020||World||‘We don’t know how it will end’: Hunger stalks amid coronavirus||When all this started — when the coronavirus began stalking humanity like an animal hunting prey, when she and her husband lost their restaurant jobs overnight as the world shut down to hide, when she feared not being able to feed her family — Janeth went outside with a red kitchen towel.It was Passover. Her pastor had told her about the roots of the Jewish holiday, about Israelites smearing a lamb’s blood on their doors as a sign for the plagues to pass them by. So Janeth, an immigrant from Honduras, reached up to hang the red towel over the door of her family’s apartment on the edge of the nation’s capital. It was close enough, she figured, “to show the angel of death to pass over our home.”Pass us by, coronavirus.And pass us by, hunger.At night now, it’s the worry over food that keeps Janeth’s mind racing, and her heart, she says, hurting. “I spend hours thinking, thinking, about what we will do the next day, where we will find food the next day,” she says weeks into the coronavirus outbreak, her family’s food and cash both dwindling.Janeth and her husband, Roberto, are part of the greatest surge in unemployment in the U.S. since the Depression, setting off a wave of hunger that is swamping food programs nationwide. The couple and every adult member of their extended family in the U.S. have lost their jobs in the economic lockdown prompted by the pandemic.They are among the tens of millions in America — more than 1 out of every 6 workers — abruptly cut off from paychecks.The Associated Press is withholding the couple’s full names because they are in the country illegally and could face deportation. Their immigration status, their problems with English and scanty access to the Internet all combine to block them from accessing the U.S. government benefit programs that millions more newly jobless citizens are able to turn to during the outbreak.Before the pandemic, food policy experts say, roughly one out of every eight or nine Americans struggled to stay fed. Now as many as one out of every four are projected to join the ranks of the hungry, said Giridhar Mallya, senior policy officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for public health.Immigrants, African Americans, Native Americans, households with young children and newly jobless gig workers are among those most at risk, said Joelle Johnson, senior policy associate at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.“They’re more vulnerable to begin with and this situation has just exacerbated that situation,” she said.When the global economy clamped down, Roberto, a cook in his mid-30s, and Janeth, who keeps water glasses filled at another restaurant and is in her mid-40s, spent $450 out of their final paychecks to stock up. Weeks later, their diminished cache includes two half-full five-pound bags of rice, an assortment of ramen noodles, a half-eaten bag of pasta, two boxes of cornbread mix, four boxes of raisins and cans of beans, pineapple, tuna, corn and soup.“Cookies?” Roberto and Janeth’s 5-year-old, gap-toothed daughter Allison still asks them, always getting a gentle “no” back. “Ice cream?”Janeth and Roberto have cut down to one meal a day themselves, skipping meals to keep their daughter fed.On a good day recently, after Roberto landed four hours of work preparing take-home meals for a grocery store, they had enough for what constitutes a feast these days — a can of refried beans split three ways and two eggs each, scrambled. Janeth also made tortillas from their last half-bag of masa flour.Janeth placed aluminum foil over two of the plates; she and Roberto would eat later. Tears sprang from her eyes as she watched her daughter wolf down the meal.“Where can we get enough food? How can we pay our bills?” she asked. Then she repeated something she and her husband emphasized again and again over the course of several days: They are hard-working people.“We have never had to ask for help before,” she said.Janeth and Roberto also have three adult children and, as the oldest of three sisters here, she and Roberto are trying to keep a half-dozen households in the United States and Honduras fed.By day, they race in their second-hand pickup truck from food pantries and churches to relatives’ houses. They chase tips about food giveaways or temporary jobs. They share their painstakingly acquired cartons of food with her two sisters, who themselves have a total of five young children to feed, and call their grown children with leads on food lines.And they fight off despair. “We don’t have help. We don’t know how it will end,” Janeth said.On a recent day, Janet and Roberto’s breakfast is coffee and a few crackers. Allison eats cereal, a favorite provided by a food bank.Soon after, Roberto and Allison, who is sporting pink sparkly sneakers, are among the first in line outside a DC food pantry. In line with them: a young African American man newly unemployed and seeking aid for the first time and two foreign-born nannies with their clients’ children in tow. The women now are only intermittently used — and paid — by their employers and need help feeding their own children at home.Roberto is happy to leave with a bag of bananas, some spaghetti, tomato sauce and other staples.Another day, Roberto and Allison stay inside the truck while Janeth heads out in a cold drizzle to approach a church said to be providing food. She struggles to read the sign in English posted on the door, then calls the numbers listed. No one answers.Later, loading their pickup truck to take food to Janeth’s sisters, husband and wife dip into the pockets of their jeans to display the cash they have left — $110 total.That’s gas money. Without that, living on the outskirts of town, there’s no getting to food banks, to one-day cash jobs, to stranded relatives facing eviction and hoping for food.On the drive to Janeth’s sisters in Baltimore, Janeth hands Allison a small container of applesauce. The girl savors each taste, dipping in her finger, licking every last bit. “More?” she asks hopefully, tilting the container toward her mother.Janeth answers regretfully, tenderly. No more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-don-t-know-how-it-will-end-hunger-stalks-amid-coronavirus/story-ebuGmr7NTOIihJFWw4QuLM.html
04-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Italy begins to emerge from world’s longest nationwide lockdown||Stir-crazy Italians will be free to stroll and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks on Monday as Europe’s hardest-hit country eases back the world’s longest nationwide coronavirus lockdown.Four million people -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- will return to their construction sites and factories as the economically and emotionally shattered country tries to get back to work.Restaurants that have managed to survive Italy’s most disastrous crisis in generations will reopen for takeaway service.But bars and even ice cream parlours will remain shut. The use of public transport will be discouraged and everyone will have to wear masks in indoor public spaces.“We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,” 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome.“There will be great happiness in being able to go running again carefree, in my son being allowed to have his little cousin over to blow out his birthday candles, to see our parents,” the father-of-three said.“But we are also apprehensive because they are old and my father-in-law has cancer so is high risk”. ‘Moment of responsibility’ Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus emerged in December, led the world with an unprecedented lockdown on January 23 that lasted 76 days. Weeks later Italy followed suit, becoming the first Western democracy to shut down virtually everything in the face of an illness that has now officially killed 28,884 -- the most in Europe -- and some fear thousands more.The lives of Italians began closing in around them as it became increasingly apparent that the first batch of infections in provinces around Milan were spiralling out of control.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte began by putting a quarter of the population in the northern industrial heartland on lockdown on March 8.The sudden measure frightened many -- fearful of being locked in together with the gathering threat -- into fleeing to less affected regions further south.The danger of the virus spreading with them and incapacitating the south’s less developed health care system forced Conte to announce a nationwide lockdown on March 9.“Today is our moment of responsibility,” Conte told the nation. “We cannot let our guard down.”The official death toll was then 724.More waves of restrictions followed as hundreds began dying each day.Almost everything except for pharmacies and grocery stores was shuttered across the Mediterranean country of 60 million on March 12.Conte’s final roll of the dice involved closing all non-essential factories on March 22.Italy’s highest single toll -- 969 -- was reported five days later. ‘Worried about reopening’ The economic toll of all those shutdowns has been historic.Italy’s economy -- the eurozone’s third-largest last year -- is expected to shrink more than in any year since the global depression of the 1930s.Half of the workforce is receiving state support and the same number told a top pollster that they were afraid of becoming unemployed.And some of those who are out of a job already say they do not entirely trust in Conte’s ability to safely navigate the nation out of peril.“I am worried about the reopening. The authorities seem very undecided about how to proceed,” 37-year-old Davide Napoleoni told AFP.Conte’s popularity has jumped along with that of most of other world leaders grappling with the pandemic thanks to a rally around the flag effect.But a Demos poll conducted at the end of April found some of Conte’s lustre fading.Confidence in his government has slipped by eight percentage points to a still-strong 63 percent since March.Psychological toll Italy’s staggered reopening is complicated by a highly decentralised system that allows the country’s 20 regions to layer on their own rules.Venice’s Veneto and the southern Calabria regions have thus been serving food and drink at bars and restaurants with outdoor seating since last week.The area around Genoa is thinking of allowing small groups of people to go sailing and reopening its beaches.Neighbouring Emilia-Romagna is keeping them closed -- even to those who live by the sea.All this uncertainty appears to be weighing on the nation’s psyche.A poll by the Piepoli Institute showed 62 percent of Italians think they will need psychological support with coming to grips with the post-lockdown world.“The night of the virus continues,” sociologist Ilvo Diamanti wrote in La Repubblica daily.“And you can hardly see the light on the horizon. If anything, we’re getting used to moving in the dark.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-italy-begins-to-emerge-from-world-s-longest-nationwide-lockdown/story-QKtOrka2Y1F4Mb5OMZsIuM.html
04-05-2020||World||Docs prepared to announce my death, recalls Boris Johnson||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has revealed that doctors at a London hospital where he was admitted after contracting Covid-19 had made arrangements to announce his death. Johnson, 55, was rushed to St Thomas’ Hospital on April 5 when his condition had worsened a few days after he had tested positive for the coronavirus. After spending a few days in intensive care, he emerged on April 12.Recalling his near-death experience in an interview to The Sun published on Sunday, an emotional Johnson said he was administered “litres and litres” of oxygen, but ICU monitors were showing little progress, compelling doctors to make plans to announce his death.“It was a tough old moment, I won’t deny it. They had a strategy to deal with a death-of-Stalin type scenario. I was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place. The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went wrong.“It was hard to believe that in just a few days, my health had deteriorated to this extent... The bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. That was when it got a bit... they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally.”The report said the UK PM’s voice faltered and eyes reddened during the interview in Downing Street. “I’ve broken my nose, I’ve broken my finger, I’ve broken my wrist, I’ve broken my rib. I’ve broken just about everything. I’ve broken all sorts of things. But I’ve never had anything as serious as this,” he said. “The indicators kept going in the wrong direction and I thought, ‘There’s no medicine for this thing and there’s no cure’. That was the stage when I was thinking, ‘How am I going to get out of this?’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/docs-prepared-to-announce-my-death-recalls-boris-johnson/story-CF4FOlfruXwxseZOvPJBTI.html
04-05-2020||World||‘Too early for firm conclusions’: Canada PM Trudeau on allegations against China on spread of Covid-19||Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau has said that it is “too early to draw firm conclusions” on allegations if China did a cover-up on coronavirus leading to an explosion of Covid-19 pandemic . Canada is part of the intelligence alliance Five Eyes, which has blamed China for the coronavirus outbreak. Trudeau’s comment came during a daily media briefing in Ottawa hours after multiple global media organisations put out reports based on a leaked intelligence dossier that blamed China for hiding and even destroying evidence of the coronavirus pandemic, thus contributing to its worldwide spread. The 15-page dossier came from the Five Eyes intelligence bloc, comprising the United States, Canada, England, New Zealand and Australia.However, Trudeau was circumspect when addressing the matter as he said “it is still early to draw firm conclusions and indeed our focus remains on how we are working to protect Canadians.”He did indicate that intelligence gathering and investigation in this respect was ongoing, as he said, “We will continue to work with intelligence agencies around the world, not just the Five Eyes but friends and partners as well and look to find answers to the many questions people are asking.” Trudeau’s remarks preceded a comment from US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that there is “enormous evidence” the virus leaked from a virology laboratory in Wuhan.The Canadian PM has been similarly guarded on this matter even earlier when US President Donald Trump had charged China with allowing the virus to proliferate.However, one of Trudeau’s Cabinet colleagues, Health Minister Patty Hadju, had earlier dismissed questions about China potentially fudging Covid-19 figures, as part of “conspiracy theories” on the Internet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/too-early-for-firm-conclusions-canada-pm-trudeau-on-allegations-against-china-on-spread-of-covid-19/story-9LDBEbhWxT1g75aqEMrVQL.html
04-05-2020||World||Trump hits out at Bush for failing to support him during impeachment||US President Donald Trump on Sunday struck out at former president George W. Bush in a video called for compassion and solidarity over the coronavirus pandemic.Bush -- like Trump, a member of the Republican Party -- drew a parallel between the Covid-19 crisis and the September 11, 2001 attack in a clip posted Saturday by the George W. Bush Presidential Center.The Al-Qaeda led terror attacks took place just months after Bush arrived in the White House.“Following 9/11 I saw a great nation rise as one to honor the brave, to grieve with the grieving, and to embrace unavoidable new duties,” Bush said, with archive images playing in the background.Bush, 73, said he was convinced that the “spirit of sacrifice” has not disappeared, and called for compassion as the United States struggles to quell the novel coronavirus.“Let us remember how small our differences are in the face of this shared threat,” said Bush. “In the final analysis we are not partisan combatants, we are human beings.”Bush added that Americans should “remember that empathy and simple kindness are essential, powerful tools of national recovery.”As someone who is regularly criticized for his lack of empathy, Trump may have felt targeted.Early Sunday, Trump responded, by apparently quoting a co-anchor from the “Fox and Friends” show on Fox News.“Oh bye the way, I appreciate the message from former President Bush, but where was he during Impeachment calling for putting partisanship aside,” Trump wrote, quoting the co-anchor.Trump then added in his own voice: “He was nowhere to be found in speaking up against the greatest Hoax in American history!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-hits-out-at-bush-for-failing-to-support-him-during-impeachment/story-xd1gGXukfUHIquqBmXtxjP.html
04-05-2020||World||Covid-19: France says won’t quarantine EU, Schengen area citizens||France said Sunday that it would not quarantine anyone arriving from the EU, the Schengen area or Britain due to the coronavirus, as it prepares to start easing confinement measures after two months of lockdown.On Saturday, the government had said it would extend the state of emergency to contain the crisis until at least July 24, and anyone entering France would have to remain in isolation for two weeks.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBut the quarantine rules would not apply to “anyone arriving from the European Union, the Schengen zone or Britain, regardless of their nationality”, the presidency said on Sunday.And for French and EU citizens arriving in France from other regions outside the EU, the Schengen area and Britain, “the rules will be announced in the coming days”, the presidency said. Nevertheless, the tougher border controls introduced by France in mid-March to limit coronavirus contagion, particularly at the border with Germany, will continue, the interior ministry told AFP. “The travel restrictions currently in place at our borders will continue to apply,” the ministry said. “Nothing has changed.” The number of new deaths from Covid-19 in France has been declining in recent days, with 135 fatalities reported over the past 24 hours on Sunday. The national health service said the increase brought France’s total death toll to 24,895, the world’s fifth highest figure after the United States, Italy, Britain and Spain.The last time the number of daily reported deaths was below 135 was on March 22, when it represented only those reported by hospitals.The current figure also includes deaths reported by elderly care homes and other medicalised care facilities.France plans to start lifting the coronavirus lockdown from May 11, when children are to return to school in stages, some businesses will reopen and people will be able to travel within 100 kilometres (60 miles) of their homes without a signed justification for their movement.But Health Minister Olivier Veran warned Sunday that this would depend on further declines in Covid-19 infections, especially in hard-hit areas like the Paris region and northeast France.The government has said the number of new coronavirus cases must stabilise at fewer than 3,000 per day as it expands testing, otherwise doctors and nurses could face another wave of patients that have tested hospitals since March.“If the number of new cases proves too high, we’ll have to reconsider the date for lifting the lockdown, and decide according to the situation in each department,” Veran told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper.He also cautioned against planning summer holidays for now, saying “it’s unlikely that this virus is going to go on vacation”.Officials are scrambling to ramp up testing capacities to 700,000 people each week by May 11, which health experts say is essential for containing the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-says-won-t-quarantine-eu-schengen-area-citizens/story-roGtGHKjEVKGLFcA4WNDIK.html
04-05-2020||World||‘Extend Covid-19 emergency benefits to international students’: An appeal to Canadian PM||A leading Indo-Canadian organisation has written to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, appealing to him to extend emergency benefits announced during the Covid-19 pandemic to international students, including nearly 200000 from India.Students from India comprise the largest contingent from abroad in Canada, with over 2 lakh from among the nearly 6.5 lakh. However, a large number of them have been stranded in Canada after restrictive measures were announced in March and colleges and universities closed while returning to India was not an option due to the lockdown in their home country.However, the Canada Emergency Student Benefits programme or CESB, announced by Trudeau last month, is targeted at Canadian students, meaning citizens and permanent residents. Canada India Foundation or CIF, a leading community group, has expressed its “dismay” over the exclusion of international students from within the purview of the programme, in a letter sent to Trudeau.“The federal government must include international students to come under the ambit of the CESB because their circumstances are materially not different from those of local students,” CIF chair Anil Shah said. The support announced will run from May to August and will provide CA $ 1250 to post-secondary students and recent graduates, with that amount increasing by CA$ 500 for those with dependents or those with disabilities.However, Indian students may be suffering from neglect since they can no longer earn any income as many retail establishments are closed. Such students are allowed to work for 20 hours a week to support themselves. “There is no way out because they can’t return home,” CIF stated in the letter.The number of Indian students coming to Canada has increased in recent years, at almost 350 per cent over the figure for 2014.Satish Thakkar, CIF’s national convener said, “Financial contribution of international students in Canadian economy around $22 billion, and it supports over 170,000 Canadian jobs, by supporting them at this very critical time will encourage future flow of international students from all over the world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extend-covid-19-emergency-benefits-to-international-students-an-appeal-to-canadian-pm/story-bs6EoGzm7q6teVktLpgGGO.html
04-05-2020||World||‘Enormous evidence’ coronavirus came from China lab: Mike Pompeo||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday said “enormous evidence” showed the new coronavirus originated in a lab in China, further fueling tensions with Beijing over its handling of the outbreak.Pompeo’s comments came as Europe and parts of the United States prepared to cautiously lift virus lockdowns as signs emerge that the deadly pandemic is ebbing and governments look to restart their battered economies.More than 245,000 people have been killed and 3.4 million infected worldwide by the virus, which has left half of humanity under some form of lockdown and pushed the global economy towards its worst downturn since the Great Depression.US President Donald Trump, increasingly critical of China’s management of the first outbreak in the city of Wuhan in December, claims to have proof it started in a Chinese laboratory. Scientists believe the virus jumped from animals to humans, after emerging in China, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat.‘History of infecting the world’ China denies the claims, and the US Director of National Intelligence office has said analysts are still examining the exact origin of the outbreak.Pompeo, a former CIA chief, told the ABC he agreed that the Covid-19 virus was not man-made.But Pompeo went further than Trump, citing “enormous” evidence that the virus originated in a Wuhan lab. He did not however present evidence to back up his claim.“I think the whole world can see now, remember, China has a history of infecting the world and running substandard laboratories,” he said.Pompeo said early Chinese efforts to downplay the coronavirus amounted to “a classic Communist disinformation effort. That created enormous risk.”“President Trump is very clear: we’ll hold those responsible accountable.”Pressure from demonstratorsUS news reports say Trump has tasked US spies to find out more about the origins of the virus, as he makes China’s handling of the pandemic a centerpiece of his campaign for the November presidential election.The United States has the most coronavirus deaths in the world at more 67,600, with 1,450 recorded over the 24-hours late Sunday.Trump, speaking at a live TV event, promised an early coronavirus vaccine and an “incredible” future for the country as he sought to relaunch his disrupted election campaign.Florida is set to ease its lockdown Monday, as other US states wrestle with pressure from demonstrators -- some carrying weapons -- who have rallied against the restrictions.In New York, the epicenter of the US outbreak, an emergency field hospital erected in Central Park is set to close as virus cases decline.But dozens of New Yorkers were fined for violating social distancing guidelines as they flocked to beaches and parks in balmy weekend weather.In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro railed against the country’s lockdown in a speech to thousands of anti-confinement demonstrators, even as the national death toll rose above 7,000.‘Rules are not clear’ Across the Atlantic, European nations prepared for cautious easing of restrictions.Hard-hit Italy -- which reported its lowest daily toll since stay-at-home orders were imposed on March 10 -- is set to follow Spain in allowing people outside.Starting Monday Italians will be allowed to stroll in parks and visit relatives. Restaurants can open for takeaways and wholesale stores can resume business, but there was some confusion over the rules.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageRomans were doing aerobics on rooftop terraces and exercising indoors while squares in the city center were mostly empty on the last day that Italians were obliged to remain within 200 meters of their homes.“On the one hand, we’re super excited for the reopening, we’re already organizing various activities the kids will be able to do with their grandparents outdoors,” said Rome resident Marghe Lodoli, who has three children.“On the other hand, it’s disorientating. The rules are not clear, and we’re not sure if just using common sense will do.”Italian authorities have said some preventative measures are still needed in a country that has the second-highest number of virus deaths.In another sign of life returning, an influential German minister said Sunday he supports a resumption of the country’s football season this month as long as teams respect hygiene conditions.The British government said the easing of coronavirus lockdown measures was likely to be gradual, as it announced a further rise in the overall death toll.Most governments are sticking to measures to control the spread of the virus -- social distancing and masks in public -- and more testing to try to track infections even as they relax curbs.Even as some European countries gradually lift restrictions, officials in Moscow -- the epicenter of the contagion in Russia -- urged residents to stay home.With cases increasing by several thousand each day, Russia is now the European country registering the most new infections.Prepare for ‘bad scenarios’ European leaders are backing an initiative from Brussels to raise 7.5 billion euros ($8.3 billion) to tackle the pandemic and raise funds for efforts to find a vaccine for Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.The race is on to find a viable vaccine or treatment with several countries involved in trials.In Asia, South Korea -- once the second worst-hit nation on the planet -- said Sunday it would ease a ban on some gatherings and events as long as they “follow disinfection measures.”Thailand allowed businesses such as restaurants, hair salons and outdoor markets to reopen so long as social distancing was maintained and temperature checks carried out.But experts caution that many countries are still not through the worst.The Philippines suspended all flights into and out of the country in a bid to ease pressure on its congested quarantine facilities.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced that mosques would reopen across large parts of the Islamic Republic, after they were closed in early March to try to contain the Middle East’s deadliest Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/enormous-evidence-coronavirus-came-from-china-lab-mike-pompeo/story-3MjmTDPiXaTu40pCahIbQJ.html
04-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Trump pushes for reopening US economy in televised town hall||Anxious for an economic recovery, President Donald Trump fielded Americans’ questions about decisions by some states to allow non-essential businesses to reopen while other states are on virtual lockdown due to the coronavirus.After more than a month of being cooped up at the White House, Trump returned from a weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland and participated in a “virtual” town hall, hosted Sunday night by Fox News Channel, from inside the Lincoln Memorial. He pushed for an economic reopening, one his advisers believe will be essential for his reelection chances this November.“We have to get it back open safely but as quickly as possible,” Trump said.The president acknowledged fear on both sides of the issue, some Americans worried about getting sick while others are concerned about losing jobs. Though the administration’s handling of the pandemic, particularly its ability to conduct widespread testing, has come under fierce scrutiny, the president defended the response and said the nation was ready to begin reopening.“I’ll tell you one thing. We did the right thing and I really believe we saved a million and a half lives,” the president said. But he also broke with the assessment of his senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, saying it was “too soon to say” if the federal government was overseeing a “success story.”Trump’s impatience also flashed. While noting that states would go at their own pace in returning to normal, with ones harder hit by the coronavirus going slower, he said that “some states frankly I think aren’t going fast enough” and singled out Virginia, which has a Democratic governor and legislature. And he urged the nation’s schools and universities to return to classes this fall.But many public health experts believe that cannot be done safely until a vaccine is developed. Trump declared Sunday that he believed one could be available by year’s end although his own pandemic task force has predicated it could be another 18 months.Federal guidelines that encouraged people to stay at home and practice social distancing expired late last week.Debate continued over moves by governors to start reopening state economies that tanked after shopping malls, salons and other nonessential businesses were ordered closed in attempt to slow a virus that has killed more than 66,000 Americans, according to a tally of reported deaths by Johns Hopkins University.The U.S. economy has suffered, shrinking at a 4.8% annual rate from January through March, the government estimated last week. It was the sharpest quarterly drop since the 2008 financial crisis.Roughly 30.3 million people have filed for unemployment aid in the six weeks since the outbreak forced employers to shut down and slash their workforces. It was the worst string of layoffs on record.Larry Kudlow, Trump’s top economic adviser, on Sunday predicted a “spectacular 2021” — with “the right set of policies” — on top of a rebound from July through December of this year. He said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that the administration would “pause” to review the effectiveness of trillions in economic relief spending before making any decision on whether additional aid is needed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday that state and local governments are seeking up to $1 trillion for coronavirus costs,The Senate planned to reopen Monday, despite the Washington area’s continued status as a virus hot spot and with the region still under stay-at-home orders. The House remains shuttered. The pandemic is forcing big changes at the tradition-bound Supreme Court: The justices will hear arguments, beginning Monday, by telephone for the first time since Alexander Graham Bell patented his invention in 1876.Congressional Republicans are resisting calls by Democrats for emergency spending for states and local governments whose revenue streams all but dried up in recent weeks. The GOP is counting on the country’s reopening and the rebound promised by Trump as their best hope to forestall another big round of virus aid.The leaders of California and Michigan are among governors under public pressure over lockdowns still in effect while states such as Florida, Georgia and Ohio are reopening.Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, said Sunday that the armed protesters who demonstrated inside her state’s Capitol “depicted some of the worst racism” and “awful parts” of U.S. history by showing up with Confederate flags, nooses and swastikas.Trump had tweeted “LIBERATE” and named Michigan and other states in mid-April. In a new tweet Friday, he urged Whitmer to “make a deal” with the protesters. “These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely!” Trump said.Despite the opposition of Michigan’s Republican-controlled Legislature, Whitmer has extended a state of emergency declaration and directed most businesses statewide to remain closed.Some people participating in other public protests across the U.S. have not kept their distance from one another and have rallied without masks, not heeding public health recommendations.Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, called that behavior “devastatingly worrisome.” She said people will feel guilty for the rest of their lives if they end up infected and unwittingly spread the virus to vulnerable family members.“We need to protect each other at the same time we’re voice our discontent,” she told CNN’s “State of the Union.”An overwhelming majority of Americans support stay-at-home orders and other efforts to slow the virus’ spread, according to a recent survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.Asked about states that are reopening before they meet benchmarks laid out in federal guidelines she helped write, Birx said the guidelines “are a pretty firm policy of what we think is important from a public health standpoint.” She added that she and others have made it clear that people must continue practicing social distancing, “scrupulous” hand washing and other measures to protect themselves and others.Fox News Channel said it asked viewers to submit questions about reopening the country on the network’s Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts for a chance to appear on the rare broadcast from the Lincoln Memorial. Trump spoke from the memorial’s steps last July Fourth. It’s also where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I have a dream” speech in 1963. Trump recently compared his Independence Day audience to King’s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-trump-pushes-for-reopening-us-economy-in-televised-town-hall/story-jYGksdAGbjoFFaUoHPu7CM.html
04-05-2020||World||NYPD cop stripped of gun, badge for violently arresting man for social distancing violation||A New York City police officer who was caught on video Saturday pointing a stun gun at a man and violently taking him to the ground over an alleged social distancing violation has been stripped of his gun and badge and placed on desk duty pending an internal investigation.Bystander video showed the plainclothes officer, who was not wearing a protective face mask, slapping 33-year-old Donni Wright in the face, punching him in the shoulder and dragging him to a sidewalk after leveling him in a crosswalk in Manhattan’s East Village.“The behavior I saw in that video is simply not acceptable,” Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted Sunday. He said earlier in the day that there will be a careful look into what happened.Police spokeswoman Sgt. Mary Frances O’Donnell said Wright “took a fighting stance against the officer” when he was ordered to disperse and was arrested on charges including assault on a police officer and resisting arrest.The charges have been deferred pending further investigation, a Manhattan District Attorney’s Office spokesperson said.A message seeking comment was left with the police officers union.Wright’s arrest and that of two other people minutes earlier on the same block across from a public housing complex raised new questions about the police department’s use of force, the role of officers in enforcing social distancing measures and inconsistency in how they’re applied.The manner of Wright’s arrest appeared to echo that of 20-year-old Fitzroy Gayle, who was seen on bystander video pleading for help as several officers wrestled him into submission on a Brooklyn sidewalk in early March.Jennvine Wong, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society’s Cop Accountability Project, said footage of the arrests Saturday stood in sharp contrast to photos and video — including some tweeted out by the police department — showing officers in crowded city parks handing out face masks and gently reminding people to stay 6 feet apart.“This certainly isn’t the first time and this isn’t even the first time in this pandemic that we’ve seen evidence of discriminatory policing by the NYPD,” Wong said.Carolyn Martinez-Class, of the police watchdog Communities United for Police Reform, said: “This incident illustrates why public health professions and community partners should be responsible for social distancing education and creating norms — not police.”The police department assigned 1,000 officers to social distancing patrols over the weekend as temperatures reached the high 70s (about 25 degrees Celsius). On Saturday, they issued 51 summonses, including 43 in city parks. At a news conference Sunday, Shea said he was aware of just three arrests.Minutes before the confrontation with Wright, video from a nearby security camera showed officers used force in arresting a couple for allegedly failing to comply when asked to disperse. O’Donnell said officers saw that one of them, a 31-year-old man, had a “bag of alleged marijuana in plain view.”The bystander video of Wright’s arrest showed the plainclothes officer, Francisco Garcia, helping take one of those people to the ground before turning his attention to Wright, who was moving toward the area of that arrest from about 10 to 15 feet away.Garcia — in a black T-shirt, jeans and a Yankees cap — turned toward Wright and cursed at him to “(get) back right now,” according to the video. At the same time, the officer pulls up his Taser and points it toward Wright, possibly triggering the device.Garcia continued toward Wright and eventually holstered his Taser. It wasn’t clear what Wright was doing because he wasn’t in the frame the entire time, though just before Garcia tackled him, he was seen stopping and standing in front of the officer with what appeared to be a clenched fist at his side.“What you flexing for? Don’t flex,” Garcia said, before grabbing Wright and wrestling him to the ground, slapping and punching him in the process. The officer then took Wright’s arm and dragged him from the crosswalk where he landed back onto the sidewalk and pushed him onto his stomach.The video then showed another officer stepping in and helping handcuff Wright.Kneeling on the top of Wright’s back or neck to keep him down, the plainclothes officer started jawing and cursing at bystanders.One of them yelled back: “he didn’t even do nothing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nypd-cop-stripped-of-gun-badge-for-violently-arresting-man-for-social-distancing-violation/story-jyv2arqMDnGO9bLfTNS7AM.html
04-05-2020||World||China hid extent and severity of coronavirus’ outbreak to hoard medical supplies: US Report||U.S. officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak — and how contagious the disease is — to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.Chinese leaders “intentionally concealed the severity” of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press. The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government’s response to the virus was slow and inadequate. President Donald Trump’s political opponents have accused him of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home.Not classified but marked “for official use only,” the DHS analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by “denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data,” the analysis states.The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus “was a contagion” for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad — and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China’s changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report.In a tweet on Sunday, the president appeared to blame U.S. intelligence officials for not making clearer sooner just how dangerous a potential coronavirus outbreak could be. Trump has been defensive over whether he failed to act after receiving early warnings from intelligence officials and others about the coronavirus and its potential impact.“Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S.,” Trump wrote without citing specifics. “Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner.”Trump had previously speculated that China may have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible “mistake.” His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.Speaking Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he added, “Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories.”“These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab,” Pompeo said. “And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.”The secretary of state appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. His remark may be seen as offensive in China. Still, Pompeo repeated the same assertion hours later, via a tweet Sunday afternoon.Speaking Sunday on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, echoed that sentiment, saying he believes China “is the most significant geopolitical threat to the United States for the next century.”“The communist government in China bears enormous responsibility, enormous direct culpability for this pandemic. We know they covered it up,” Cruz said. “Had they behaved responsibly and sent in health professionals and quarantined those infected, there’s a real possibility this could have been a regional outbreak, and not a global pandemic. And the hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide are in a very real sense the direct responsibility of the communist Chinese government’s lies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hid-extent-and-severity-of-coronavirus-outbreak-to-hoard-medical-supplies-us-report/story-JvAUcEsWWBzyW5qkHhsaOI.html
04-05-2020||World||Trump leadership void on South Asia persists as diplomat retires||The acting top US diplomat for South Asia announced her retirement Sunday, as President Donald Trump looks increasingly likely to go a full term without a Senate-confirmed State Department official focused on the subcontinent.Alice Wells, a career diplomat who has served as acting assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia for most of the Trump administration, will retire in May after a 31-year career, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.“I will miss Alice’s wise counsel and dedicated efforts to build relationships and address challenges across South and Central Asia,” Pompeo wrote on Twitter.Trump has called for a close relationship with India and has bonded with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, including on a visit to the country in February.But under Trump, South and Central Asia has been the only region of the world yet to have a full-fledged assistant secretary of state confirmed by the Senate.With six months to go before presidential elections and all eyes on the coronavirus crisis, the chances look slim that an assistant secretary will be nominated and confirmed by the Senate soon.The administration put forward one person for the job, veteran intelligence official Robert Williams, but he withdrew his nomination in April 2019, citing personal reasons.Wells, despite not having the authority of a presidential nomination and Senate confirmation, has been active in promoting a closer US relationship with India.She nonetheless made headlines last year when she called on India to restore internet access and free political leaders in Kashmir Valley -- a rare statement of concern over India’s rights record, following pressure from the US Congress.Also last year, she made an unusually detailed case for Pakistan to be wary about a major infrastructure push by China.Wells’ departure also comes as the United States begins to pull troops from Afghanistan to end its longest-ever war, although a special US envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, is in charge of negotiating with the Taliban.Wells focused earlier in her career on Russia and served under former president Barack Obama as ambassador to Jordan. Trump pulled her from Amman as his administration reshaped priorities in the Middle East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-leadership-void-on-south-asia-persists-as-diplomat-retires/story-F1wWO2UQc1KAdpjv2OLAVI.html

They know what they’re getting into.”Trump appeared to acknowledge that he was getting ahead of his own advisors on the prediction for the vaccine.“The doctors would say ‘well, you shouldn’t say that.’ I’ll say what I think,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-have-coronavirus-vaccine-by-end-of-year-says-donald-trump/story-fS6FDvG0uVHbh3UaoNw0FP.html

04-05-2020||World||Coronavirus origin: Mike Pompeo points at Wuhan lab||US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has said that “enormous evidence” shows that the coronavirus outbreak began in a laboratory in Wuhan, China. He didn’t provide any proof for his claims, though.“I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan,” Pompeo said on ABC’s This Week. “These are not the first times that we’ve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab.”Pompeo stopped short of saying the virus was man-made, saying that he agreed with a report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that ruled out genetic modification.“I’ve seen what the intelligence community has said,” said Pompeo. “I have no reason to believe that they’ve got it wrong.”Meanwhile, prisons in the US that hold the world’s largest number of incarcerated people have been tormented by a wave of coronavirus infections and fatalities.More than 14,400 inmates have been infected and some 215 have died, said Marshall Project, a non-partisan news organisation. Official numbers from the Bureau of Prions showed 1,919 cases and 37 fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-origin-mike-pompeo-points-at-wuhan-lab/story-jTgRenxJlUhSt5XNmT0jbM.html
04-05-2020||World||At Lincoln Memorial, Donald Trump to take public’s pandemic queries||Anxious for an economic recovery, President Donald Trump prepared to field Americans’ questions about decisions by some states to allow nonessential businesses to reopen while other states are on virtual lockdown due to the coronavirus.After more than a month of being cooped up at the White House, Trump was returning from a weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland and planned to participate in a “virtual” town hall, hosted Sunday night by Fox News Channel, from inside the Lincoln Memorial.“Hopefully our Country will soon mend,” Trump tweeted. Federal guidelines that encouraged people to stay at home and practice social distancing expired late last week.Debate continued over moves by governors to start reopening state economies that tanked after shopping malls, salons and other nonessential businesses were ordered closed in attempt to slow a virus that has killed more than 66,000 Americans, according to a tally of reported deaths by Johns Hopkins University.The U.S. economy has suffered, shrinking at a 4.8% annual rate from January through March, the government estimated last week. It was the sharpest quarterly drop since the 2008 financial crisis.Roughly 30.3 million people have filed for unemployment aid in the six weeks since the outbreak forced employers to shut down and slash their workforces. It was the worst string of layoffs on record.Trump has made it clear that he wants the country reopened.“I like the states opening. They will be opening,” the president said Friday as he left the White House for Camp David. “They’re going to open safely and quickly, I hope, because we have to get our country back.”Larry Kudlow, Trump’s top economic adviser, on Sunday predicted a “spectacular 2021” — with “the right set of policies” — on top of a rebound from July through December of this year. He said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that the administration would “pause” to review the effectiveness of trillions in economic relief spending before making any decision on whether additional aid is needed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday that state and local governments are seeking up to $1 trillion for coronavirus costs,The Senate planned to reopen Monday, despite the Washington area’s continued status as a virus hot spot and with the region still under stay-at-home orders. The House remains shuttered. The pandemic is forcing big changes at the tradition-bound Supreme Court: The justices will hear arguments, beginning Monday, by telephone for the first time since Alexander Graham Bell patented his invention in 1876.Congressional Republicans are resisting calls by Democrats for emergency spending for states and local governments whose revenue streams all but dried up in recent weeks. The GOP is counting on the country’s reopening and an the rebound promised by Trump as their best hope to forestall another big round of virus aid.Fox News Channel said viewers were asked to submit questions about reopening the country to the network’s accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for a chance to appear on the national broadcast.Trump participated in a similar event sponsored by Fox News on March 5 in Scranton, Pennsylvania.Kayleigh McEnancy, the new White House press secretary, closed her first formal briefing on Friday by promising the town hall will be “ can’t-miss television.”___Follow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-lincoln-memorial-donald-trump-to-take-public-s-pandemic-queries/story-wHuloOg4RQI9SoKXjoVrKI.html
04-05-2020||World||US says ‘evidence’ virus came from China lab as Europe eases lockdown||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday said “enormous evidence” showed the new coronavirus originated in a lab in China, further fueling tensions with Beijing over its handling of the outbreak.Pompeo’s comments came as Europe and parts of the United States prepared to cautiously lift virus lockdowns as signs emerge that the deadly pandemic is ebbing and governments look to restart their battered economies.More than 243,000 people have been killed and 3.4 million infected worldwide by the virus, which has left half of humanity under some form of lockdown and pushed the global economy towards its worst downturn since the Great Depression.US President Donald Trump, increasingly critical of China’s management of the first outbreak in the city of Wuhan in December, last week claimed to have proof it started in a Chinese laboratory. Scientists believe the virus jumped from animals to humans, after emerging in China, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat.Trump, without giving details, said Thursday he had seen evidence the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the source, appearing to echo speculation fueled by US right-wing radio commentators about a secret lab.- ‘History of infecting the world’ -China denies the claims and even the US Director of National Intelligence office has said analysts are still examining the exact origin of the outbreak.Pompeo, a former CIA chief, told the ABC he agreed with a statement from the US intelligence community about the “wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not man-made or genetically modified.”But Pompeo went further than Trump, citing “significant” and “enormous” evidence that the virus originated in a Wuhan lab.“I think the whole world can see now, remember, China has a history of infecting the world and running substandard laboratories.”Pompeo said early Chinese efforts to downplay the coronavirus amounted to “a classic Communist disinformation effort. That created enormous risk.”“President Trump is very clear: we’ll hold those responsible accountable.”- Pressure from demonstrators -US news reports say Trump has tasked US spies to find out more about the origins of the virus, as he makes China’s handling of the pandemic a centerpiece of his campaign for the November presidential election.The United States has the most coronavirus deaths in the world at more 66,000 and Trump is keen for a turnaround to help reduce the economic pain, with tens of millions left jobless.Florida is set to ease its lockdown Monday, as other states wrestle with pressure from demonstrators -- some armed -- who have rallied against the restrictions.There are signs the pandemic is slowing in some parts of the United States.In New York, the epicenter of the US outbreak, an emergency field hospital erected in Central Park is set to close as virus cases decline.- ‘Rules are not clear’ -Across the Atlantic, European nations prepared for cautious easing of restrictions.Hard-hit Italy -- which reported its lowest daily toll since stay-at-home orders were imposed on March 10 -- is set to follow Spain in allowing people outside.Italians from Monday will be allowed to stroll in parks and visit relatives. Restaurants can open for takeaways and wholesale stores can resume business, but there was some confusion over the rules.Romans were doing aerobics on rooftop terraces and exercising indoors while squares in the city centre were mostly empty on the last day Italians were obliged to remain within 200 meters of their homes.“On the one hand, we’re super excited for the reopening, we’re already organizing various activities the kids will be able to do with their grandparents outdoors,” said Rome resident Marghe Lodoli, who has three children.“On the other hand, it’s disorientating. The rules are not clear, and we’re not sure if just using common sense will do.”Italian authorities have said some preventative measures are still needed in a country that has the second-highest number of virus deaths.Elsewhere, Germany will continue its easing Monday, while Slovenia, Poland and Hungary will allow public spaces and businesses to partially reopen.In another sign of life returning, an influential German minister said Sunday he supports a resumption of the country’s football season this month as long as teams respect hygiene conditions.The British government will unveil its own “roadmap” to ease the lockdown this week, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country was “past the peak” of the outbreak.But with health experts warning the disease could hit hard once again, governments are trying to balance easing restrictions to revive businesses against the risk of fresh outbreaks.Most governments are sticking to measures to control the spread of the virus - social distancing and masks in public -- and more testing to try to track infections even as they relax curbs.Face masks will be mandatory on public transport starting Monday in Spain, where people were allowed to go outdoors to exercise and walk freely Saturday after a 48-day lockdown.Even as some European countries gradually lift restrictions, officials in Moscow -- the epicenter of the contagion in Russia -- urged residents to stay home.With cases increasing by several thousand each day, Russia is now the European country registering the most new infections.- Prepare for ‘bad scenarios’ - European leaders are backing an initiative from Brussels to raise 7.5 billion euros ($8.3 billion) to tackle the pandemic and raise funds for efforts to find a vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.The race is on to find a viable vaccine or treatment with several countries involved in trials.In Asia, South Korea -- once the second worst-hit nation on the planet -- said Sunday it would ease a ban on some gatherings and events as long as they “follow disinfection measures”.Thailand allowed businesses such as restaurants, hair salons and outdoor markets to reopen so long as social distancing was maintained and temperature checks carried out.But experts caution that many countries are still not through the worst.The Philippines suspended all flights into and out of the country for a week starting Sunday in a bid to ease pressure on its congested quarantine facilities.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced mosques would reopen across large parts of the Islamic Republic, after they were closed in early March to try to contain the Middle East’s deadliest COVID-19 outbreak.Rouhani warned, however, that while Iran would reopen “calmly and gradually”, it should also prepare for “bad scenarios”.burs-pm/txw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-evidence-virus-came-from-china-lab-as-europe-eases-lockdown/story-OI5e4IN9aslu5NoJDgWiEP.html
