Bush and Barack Obama administrations -- had originally been tapped by his peers to lead the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, but the appointment came as Trump was increasingly taking action against inspectors general he sees as insufficiently loyal.In an unexpected move in early April, Trump ousted Fine from his job as acting Defense Department inspector general, effectively removing him from being able to serve on the committee. Afterward, Trump said he didn’t know Fine and didn’t think he had ever met him.Pandemic Watchdog Activates Site to Track Trillions in SpendingFine was praised by Jim Mattis, Trump’s first defense secretary, as a “public servant in the finest tradition of honest, competent governance,” Yahoo News reported at the time.Since then, Fine had returned to the Pentagon to his prior role as principal deputy.In his period as acting inspector general at the Defense Department, Fine improved the transparency of his office, reducing a reliance on a “For Official Use Only” label on documents that’s frequently used in the Pentagon to limit distribution of sensitive or embarrassing information.He also was credited with improving morale in his department as he pursued a wide range of probes from cost overruns on key weapons systems to the the U.S. military struggles in Syria and Iraq.The former Harvard University basketball point guard was drafted in the 10th round by the San Antonio Spurs in 1979 but accepted a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University instead.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-watchdog-resigns-after-being-blocked-from-stimulus-role-by-trump/story-R1ZncJhM26oujCWwPnyDBI.html
26-05-2020||World||Chinese lawmakers propose foreign states immunities law to counter Covid-19 lawsuit in the US||Chinese lawmakers have proposed formulating a foreign states immunities law, following litigations filed against the Asian powerhouse in the US and other countries seeking compensation over the coronavirus outbreak.The move will protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens as well as foreign investors, said Ma Yide, a deputy to the National People’s Congress (NPC) and a law researcher at the Beijing Academy of Social Sciences.It will also counteract malicious litigations raised in countries like the US towards China over the COVID-19 response, Ma told reporters Tuesday on the sidelines of the annual parliament session.A lawsuit was filed by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt against the Chinese government, the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), and other Chinese officials and institutions in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.It alleges that during the critical weeks of the initial outbreak of the coronavirus, the Chinese authorities deceived the public, suppressed crucial information, arrested whistle-blowers, denied human-to-human transmission in the face of mounting evidence, destroyed critical medical research, allowed millions of people to be exposed to the virus, and even hoarded personal protective equipment (PPE), causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable.Observers say the Missouri lawsuit could pose a problem to China in view of the US courts’ claim of universal jurisdiction.Asked for his reaction to the lawsuits whether Beijing is concerned that China’s assets overseas could be seized, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sunday said, “Some people are clamouring for so-called accountability and compensation from a victim of COVID-19. They are fabricating so-called evidence for frivolous lawsuits. These people are tramping on international rule of law and betraying human conscience” Ma said the lack of such a law has emerged as a prominent issue in the current epidemic as some countries, led by the United States, tried to shift the blame for their own governments’ incompetence on COVID-19 response.Some groups and individuals in some countries even cited the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of the United States to bring litigations to the Chinese government and relevant departments, he added.“This has trampled on the internationally recognised principle of sovereign immunity, and is also a show of hegemony and power politics,” Ma said, stressing the necessity and urgency for China to formulate a foreign states immunities law. China follows the principle of absolute immunity of foreign states and their property, thus Chinese litigants are unable to sue foreign governments from domestic courts, while Chinese governments have often been sued in foreign courts, he added.Ma suggested adopting a limited immunities principle, which is more commonly found in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the European Union countries.From a long-term perspective, adopting a limited immunities principle will show a responsible manner of the Chinese government to foreign investors, ensure stable expectations for the protection of their investments, and facilitate China’s new round of opening-up and the development of the Belt and Road Initiative, he said.Over 35 lawmakers from the NPC Beijing delegation have endorsed the proposal, which has been accepted by the session and forwarded to special committees of the National Legislature for consideration, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.It is expected to be passed by the NPC on May 28, the last day of the current session.

26-05-2020||World||Putin says Russia passed peak of Coronavirus epidemic, orders World War II victory Parade||President Vladimir Putin said Russia has passed the peak of the coronavirus epidemic and ordered preparations to resume for military parades marking the 75th anniversary of the World War II victory.Moscow and other cities should stage the postponed May 9 Victory Day parades on June 24, “given that the situation in the country as a whole, in most regions and in the Armed Forces is stable, and that it is stabilizing in many places after the peak of infections,” Putin told Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in a videoconference Tuesday.The Kremlin had planned particularly grand commemorations for the 75th anniversary this year, before Putin was forced in April to postpone the nationwide events as the coronavirus spread. The annual Red Square parade in Moscow involving thousands of troops and Russia’s most sophisticated weapons has long been an occasion for him to project a sense of power and national pride.With Russia’s economic activity declining by a third during a two-month nationwide lockdown to limit the spread of the epidemic, the Kremlin is now seeking to limit the fallout.Infections SlowThe rate of new infections has started to slow in Russia, which over the weekend slipped to third place in the number of total cases globally, after Brazil and the U.S.Diagnoses rose 2.5% in the past day to 362,342. Russia reported a record 174 deaths in the same period, taking the total to 3,807.The Kremlin is considering holding both the parade and a referendum that would open the way for Putin to remain in power until 2036, RBC website reported last week, citing four unidentified officials.The referendum, which was planned for April 22 before the epidemic derailed it, initially seemed to be a formality after parliament and the Constitutional Court took less than a week to rubber-stamp the changes endorsed by Putin that allow him to seek two more six-year terms when his current one ends in 2024.However, the economic decline due to the restrictions and a plunge in demand for oil, Russia’s main export, have caused Putin’s approval ratings to slip, according to the Levada Center and FOM polling services. Levada last month reported Putin’s approval rating fell to the lowest level in two decades.French President Emmanuel Macron had accepted Putin’s invitation to leaders of wartime allied nations to join him on Red Square for the May 9 parade. It’s unclear how many world leaders will be present on the new date, which marks the 75th anniversary of the first victory parade held by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin as troops began returning home following the defeat of Nazi Germany.Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev accepted Putin’s invitation to attend the parade during a phone talk Tuesday, according to his presidential website.While Putin told Shoigu that “the peak for us has passed, according to the specialists,” he also ordered him to take “the strictest security” measures to reduce any risks for participants.Mass marches known as “Immortal Regiments” of members of the public in memory of relatives who fought in the war will take place a month later, on July 26, because it’s not possible to observe social distancing at these events and more time is needed for the virus to subside, Putin said. They had also been planned for May 9.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-says-russia-passed-peak-of-coronavirus-epidemic-orders-world-war-ii-victory-parade/story-ppVthlasoEPyunLmAuj2RN.html

The toll had climbed closer to the mark to 98,223 by Tuesday morning with 500 more deaths in the last 24 hours; and infections were up to 1.66 million with 19,056 more.Both Republican and Democratic party conventions have been pushed back by a month in anticipation of continued restrictions from their earlier dates in late July to late August. The Republicans meet in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Democrats in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Trump threatened the venue change saying North Carolina’s Democratic governor Roy Cooper is in a “shutdown mood & unable to guarantee that by August we will be allowed full attendance in the Aren (the convention venue).”“If not,” he added, “we will be reluctantly forced to to find, with all of the jobs and economic development it brings, another Republican National Convention site.”The state governor pushed back through aides. They said that while public health officials are working with the Republican party on how to hold the convention, as scheduled, “North Carolina is relying on data and science to protect our state’s public health and safety”.Trump has targeted Democratic state governors as he has pushed for rolling back restrictions that have led to unprecedented layoffs with 38 million people having applied for unemployment benefits in the nine weeks of the lockdown. At the peak of the outbreak mid-April, he had egged on protestors with a call to “liberate” Michigan, Virginia and Minnesota.His mind is clearly on his the November elections. His tweeting has been less about the outbreak increasingly than politics: hitting Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee — over his use of masks, among other things — and his boss the former President Barack Obama. And he has taken to tweeting a new slogan, mostly in all-cpas, “Transition to Greatness”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-threatens-to-shift-republican-convention/story-Xw3eLDKnHOJasErLn0CDpL.html
26-05-2020||World||UK minister quits over PM aide’s lockdown breach row; some shops to open||The row over Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s chief adviser breaching lockdown rules continued to bedevil the government as a junior minister resigned in protest on Tuesday and several ruling Conservative MPs and others reiterated their demand that he step down or be sacked.The story of chief adviser Dominic Cummings travelling over 260 miles from London to Durham in violation of official advice in March-end after he and his wife had coronavirus symptoms overshadowed plans to reopen some shops and markets from June 1.Douglas Ross, minister for Scotland, referred to fury among his constituents over Cummings’ actions in his resignation letter to Johnson, and said questions remained for the aide to answer after he appeared before the news media on Monday evening.Ross said: “I have constituents who didn’t get to say goodbye to loved ones; families who could not mourn together; people who didn’t visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government”.“I cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right,” he wrote in his resignation letter.Attempts by Johnson and Cummings to brazen out the row were met by furious headlines not only in the left-leaning newspapers such as The Guardian and Mirror, but also Conservative-supporting mass circulation tabloids such as the Daily Mail.Church of England bishops who joined calls for the adviser’s resignation said on Tuesday they had received death threats, as the death toll and number of cases in the UK continued to rise.Johnson announced partial opening of markets: “Outdoor markets and car showrooms will be able to reopen from 1 June, as soon as they are able to meet the Covid-19 secure guidelines to protect shoppers and workers”.“All other non-essential retail including shops selling clothes, shoes, toys, furniture, books, and electronics, plus tailors, auction houses, photography studios, and indoor markets, will be expected to be able to reopen from 15 June”, he said.However, the plans were met with doubts if customers would feel confident to return to shops as the threat of pandemic continues to loom and a boom in online shopping. The row over Cummings has also endangered public trust in official advice on dealing with the virus.Stephen Reicher, expert on the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told Sky News: “One of the central messages that we gave to Government, one of the central points that we made was that the way we have gotten through this pandemic to date is by acting together, by thinking in terms of ‘we’, of what’s good for the community”.“Millions of people up and down the country have done precisely that in very difficult circumstances, agonising circumstances around their families and thought ‘What is good for us as a community?’ I think the real problem here is that not simply in what Cummings did but in the messaging that the Prime Minister put out. The lesson was, forget about the ‘we’, it’s about ‘I’.”“Now, thank God, the public at large didn’t take that attitude, the public at large, as I say, made those major sacrifices, but it threatens to undermine that sense of community if a figure as prominent as Dominic Cummings and if the Prime Minister himself starts undermining that ‘we’ message and starts talking about ‘I’.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-minister-quits-over-pm-aide-s-lockdown-breach-row-some-shops-to-open/story-TkgXaIFh66VTHflNyiVpVI.html

This year’s NPC comes as the country’s relationship with the U.S. turns increasingly frayed, with President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo both saying the coronavirus sweeping the world is likely linked to the Wuhan laboratory.China has rejected the accusations. Shi has said that the genetic characteristics of the viruses she’s worked with didn’t match those of the coronavirus spreading in humans. In a social media post, she wrote she would “swear on my life” the pandemic had nothing to do with her lab. In another interview with CGTN over the weekend, the director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Wang Yanyi, said the idea that the virus escaped from the lab was “pure fabrication.”The outbreak has infected more than 5.4 million people worldwide and killed over 345,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-is-just-tip-of-the-iceberg-warns-china-s-bat-woman/story-2hxrXlIAbHTzHA7FvCHvRM.html

The emergence of a new cluster of cases in its northeast region led officials to lock down some 100 million residents.The ambitious testing mission was announced on May 12, days after new infections emerged for the first time since a 76-day lockdown was lifted in Wuhan in April. The pace of testing increased rapidly over the course of the campaign, with the city offering tests to over 1.1 million people on May 23, more than 26 times the number that were completed on the first day, according to the Wuhan Health Commission.Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed the need to “not ruin the hard-won achievement” of containing the virus at a meeting with representatives from Hubei, the province of which Wuhan is the capital, during high-profile annual legislative meetings underway in Beijing.The nation’s top leaders strive to project an image of calm and stability during the National People’s Congress every year, making it all the more crucial for the new clusters to be quickly stamped out.Even before the mandated citywide testing in Wuhan, many companies in the city had taken the initiative to test all their employees before they returned to work because they risked getting shut down again if even a single infection was found.China has also embarked on a serological survey to determine the true scale of its outbreak. The project involves researchers taking blood samples from a representative group of people to see if they have generated antibodies to fight the virus, a sign they were infected with the virus at some point.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-tests-millions-in-12-days-as-china-fears-second-virus-wave/story-efwADhcyzbuKU1wppIH11I.html
26-05-2020||World||UK minister quits as row over PM Johnson aide’s lockdown drive continues||A junior minister in the Boris Johnson government resigned on Tuesday as the controversy over the prime minister’s chief adviser breaking lockdown rules continued to fester, despite the aide giving a detailed account of his actions on Monday.Douglas Ross, minister for Scotland, referred to millions of people following government instructions to stay at home, while aide Dominic Cummings travelled over 260 miles to Durham in north-east England from London with family in end-March.Ross said: “I haven’t commented publicly on the situation with Dominic Cummings as I have waited to hear the full details. I welcome the statement to clarify matters, but there remain aspects of the explanation which I have trouble with. As a result I have resigned as a government Minister”.“While the intentions may have been well-meaning, the reaction to this news shows that Mr Cummings’ interpretation of the government advice was not shared by the vast majority of people who have done as the government asked”.“I have constituents who didn’t get to say goodbye to loved ones; families who could not mourn together; people who didn’t visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government. I cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right,” he wrote in his resignation letter.Attempts by Johnson and Cummings to brazen out the row were met by furious headlines, not only in the left-leaning newspapers such as The Guardian and Mirror, but also Conservative-supporting mass circulation tabloids such as the Daily Mail. Church of England bishops, who joined calls for the adviser’s resignation, said on Tuesday they had received death threats.Cummings sought to justify his movements even when he and his wife had coronavirus symptoms, but questions remained after he was provided a rare forum in Downing Street to address the press on live television on Monday.Critics say if millions had interpreted the curbs as he did and moved about, UK would have been in a far worse situation than it is today – it already has the biggest death toll in Europe with 36,914 deaths and 261,184 cases as of Monday evening.Stephen Reicher, expert on the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, deplored the row and its impact on public trust in official advice to deal with the pandemic.He told Sky News: “One of the central messages that we gave to Government, one of the central points that we made was that the way we have gotten through this pandemic to date is by acting together, by thinking in terms of ‘we’, of what’s good for the community”.“Millions of people up and down the country have done precisely that in very difficult circumstances, agonising circumstances around their families and thought ‘What is good for us as a community?’ I think the real problem here is that not simply in what Cummings did but in the messaging that the Prime Minister put out.

26-05-2020||World||China’s virus diplomacy: global saviour or ‘Wolf Warrior’?||China has played two roles in the global battle against the coronavirus: a benevolent donor of aid, filling the US void, and combative superpower ready to bite back at critics.Gone are the days of low-profile diplomacy promoted by late leader Deng Xiaoping, who said Beijing should “hide your strength, bide your time”.Attitudes have changed under President Xi Jinping, who has pushed an increasingly confident policy abroad since taking office in 2012.The country has become even more assertive this year in the face of attacks over its handling of the pandemic, which started on its shores in December.Beijing has sent planeloads of medical equipment abroad, pledged $2 billion in international aid to combat COVID-19 and offered to make its potential vaccine available to all.The strategy is in line with China’s use of its economic might to win friends on the world stage, with Xi’s signature Belt and Road global infrastructure programme also expanding its influence abroad.“Chinese aid, like other countries, is part of its soft power and also has commercial and political aims,” Jocelyn Chey, a former Australian diplomat and visiting professor at the University of Sydney, told AFP.The policy has been successful in China’s battle for influence with self-ruled Taiwan and in securing support against criticism of its treatment of Muslim minorities in far-western Xinjiang, Chey said.But mixed with its generosity is a new-found readiness to tussle with geopolitical adversaries including the United States, Australia and France.It’s a risky PR battle.‘Wolf Warrior’Foreign minister Wang Yi summed up China’s attitude in a press conference on Sunday.“We never pick a fight or bully others, but at the same time, we have principles and guts,” he said. “We will surely fight back against any malicious slander to defend national honour and dignity.”Since last year Beijing has unleashed a pack of “Wolf Warrior” diplomats who use Twitter to vociferously defend and promote the Communist-led country -- while ignoring the irony that the platform is banned in mainland China.The monicker comes from the title of a blockbuster Chinese film about a Rambo-like special forces soldier who takes on foreign mercenaries.A prominent member of the “wolf” pack, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has raised eyebrows by promoting conspiracy theories that the US army may have brought the virus to China.President Donald Trump has also provided easy fodder for nationalist sentiment in China by calling the pandemic the “Chinese virus” and pushing ideas that it originated in a lab in the city of Wuhan.Relations between the two countries were already wounded by a bruising trade war, and Wang has warned that some US political forces are pushing them “to the brink of a new Cold War”.“After Trump came to power, China has been unable to evade the repressive policies he has adopted against China and can no longer keep its low profile,” Hua Po, a Beijing-based independent political commentator, told AFP.‘Uphill battle’The United States has not been the only target of Beijing’s ire.In Australia, the Chinese ambassador threatened a consumer boycott of the country’s products after Canberra called for an independent investigation into the origins and spread of the coronavirus.China’s ambassador to Paris was summoned by the French foreign ministry last month over a message on the embassy’s website that criticised the Western response to the pandemic.The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said Monday that the 27-nation bloc must adopt a “more robust” strategy against the Asian giant.“China is getting more powerful and assertive and its rise is impressive and triggers respect, but also many questions and fears,” Borrell said in a speech to German ambassadors.Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, said Beijing’s foreign policy is driven first by the interests of the ruling Communist Party and its priority to stay in power, especially with the Covid-19 crisis testing faith in authorities.“The aggressive propaganda and the ‘wolf-warrior diplomacy’ have turned many in the West against China, but this is just a price to be paid for a much more important objective of China’s policy,” Tsang said.While it might prove popular at home, winning friends on the international stage could be harder.Zhiqun Zhu, political science professor at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, said China “faces an uphill battle to improve its international image”.“I don’t think China has won the PR battle since China’s soft power is weak and its narrative is largely shrugged off as official propaganda,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-virus-diplomacy-global-saviour-or-wolf-warrior/story-Qc0Jdc1tEGUoFWHRWhdFzK.html
26-05-2020||World||Hong Kong leader says security law not a threat to freedoms||Hong Kong’s leader said Tuesday that national security legislation proposed by China’s legislature will not threaten the semi-autonomous territory’s civil rights, despite widespread criticism of the move as an encroachment on freedom of speech and assembly.The city’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, told reporters that there was “no need for us to worry” over the move being considered by China’s ceremonial National People’s Congress.“Hong Kong has proven that we uphold and preserve those values,” Lam said. “Hong Kong needs this piece of legislation for the bigger benefit of the great majority of Hong Kong people.”Lam also said that transit service would resume at Hong Kong’s international airport on June 1, but that foreigners would still be banned from entering the city as part of measures to prevent a new wave of coronavirus infections.The move by China to pass the legislation signals the central government’s determination to take greater control of Hong Kong after months of pro-democracy protests last year. Beijing has appointed new representatives in Hong Kong who follow the hard line laid down by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is also the head of the ruling Communist Party.The US has sharply criticized the legislation and threatened to withdraw preferential trade status for Hong Kong.Some “foreign politicians” have “expressed untrue opinions” about the plan to impose the law on Hong Kong, Lam said, without giving details.She repeated claims that the law would only target “a minority,” citing concerns about terrorism and subversion.Such a move has long been under consideration and was hastened by last year’s street protests in the former British colony, which was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Beijing promised that the territory could retain its own relatively liberal civil, legal and economic systems that contrast starkly with the much more centrally controlled and authoritarian system in mainland China.Hong Kong’s government is bound by Article 23 of the Basic Law — its mini-constitution — to enact laws to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition or subversion against China. It proposed legislation to do so in 2003, but withdrew it after hundreds of thousands of people came out to protest.Beijing has increasingly pushed for measures such as punishment for disrespecting the Chinese national flag or anthem — as often seen at soccer games — along with a boost to pro-China patriotic-themed education in schools. However, opposition in Hong Kong’s Legislative Council makes it unlikely a national security bill could pass at the local level, prompting Beijing to utilize what some describe as dubious legal grounds to force the measures through at the national level.The Chinese public is largely seen as backing Xi’s tough approach to foreign policy challenges, including criticism from the US, Australia and others. Xi has made an unswerving line on national interests a key signature of his rule since taking over leadership of the ruling party in 2012.Abroad, however, that policy has further bolstered concerns about China’s intentions to dominate markets and assert its influence in the Asia-Pacific region. That may ultimately add to Xi’s difficulties in reviving economic growth and jobs at a time when global markets are partly shut due to the coronavirus pandemic and skepticism toward China runs high.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-leader-says-security-law-not-a-threat-to-freedoms/story-4IKSbuLGeueg3B9nq9NTzN.html

Still other vaccine candidates are more old-fashioned, made with the killed whole virus.As of May 24, there were at least 10 vaccines in human trials, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).CanSino from China has non-replicating viral vector vaccine and there are inactivated vaccines from Sinovac, Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and Beijing Institute of Biological Products.There’s a non-replicating viral vector vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca (UK) and protein subunit vaccine from Novavax (US). RNA vaccine from Moderna and BioNTech and Pfizer (Germany/USA) and DNA vaccine from Inovio are also among those in the list.Novavax human trialDr Gregory Glenn said, Novavax’s research chief, said the company has begun the first phase of the trial in which 131 volunteers in the cities of Melbourne and Brisbane will test the safety of the vaccine and look for early signs of the vaccine’s effectiveness.“We are in parallel making doses, making vaccine in anticipation that we’ll be able to show it’s working and be able to start deploying it by the end of this year,” Glenn told a virtual press conference.‘Subunit’ vaccineThe Maryland-based Novavax is one of such several biotech companies racing to develop a vaccine against Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Two other companies, Moderna and BioNTech, in a partnership with Pfizer, have already begun clinical trials of Covid-19 vaccines.However, they are developing mRNA vaccines, a new type of vaccine that’s still unproven. There are several mRNA vaccine candidates but none have yet been approved to go to market. Those vaccines use mRNA to stimulate the body to produce copies of the coronaviruses “spike protein” in order to stimulate an immune response.Novavax is developing a “subunit” vaccine, which sends copies of the virus’ spike protein directly into the body to stimulate an immune response. This is an established vaccine technology currently already being used against diseases such as HPV, Hepatitis B and shingles.Novavax adds another new kind to that list, what’s called a recombinant vaccine. Novavax used genetic engineering to grow harmless copies of the coronavirus spike protein in giant vats of insect cells in a laboratory. Scientists extracted and purified the protein, and packaged it into virus-sized nanoparticles.The late-stage biotechnology company in April said it identified the candidate, NVX-CoV2373, with which it planned to use its Matrix-M adjuvant to enhance immune responses.Adjuvants are mainly used to make vaccines induce a strong immune response, including through the greater production of antibodies, and provide longer-lasting protection against viral and bacterial infection.Novavax said it expects preliminary immunogenicity and safety results from the trial in July.Novavax said the Phase 2 portion of the trial will be conducted in several countries, including the United States after upon the successful completion of Phase 1. It added that the Phase 2 trial will assess immunity, safety and Covid-19 reduction in a broader age range.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novavax-latest-to-start-human-trial-of-covid-19-vaccine-how-is-it-different/story-A4mrMJGd5cHNH0iCaflLBN.html
26-05-2020||World||Covid-19 cracking Germany’s defense against unemployment surge||Two months after Germany’s economy minister vowed to do everything so “no job” would be lost to the pandemic, unemployment has already risen more than during the entire 2008/2009 financial crisis.The emerging strains in Europe’s largest labor market show that even countries with well-established safety nets struggle to shield workers. State-wage support couldn’t prevent a jump in unemployment of 373,000 in April. And while a large part of that can be explained by people registering as jobless instead of entering training programs, economists are worrying about more trouble ahead.A key risk is that temporary furloughs through the famous Kurzarbeit can only delay some job losses. With the economy set to hurt for a long time, many businesses remain at risk and the coronavirus is testing the limits of a policy relying on a quick rebound. A rise in unemployment puts the economy in a potential vicious cycle: Weaker consumer demand, a further delay to the recovery and another blow to businesses such as retailers and restaurants.“Short-time work subsidies are only suitable for temporarily bridging lost work and earnings,” said Martin Mueller, an economist who focuses on the German labor market at the state-owned KfW bank. “If the restrictions last too long, many short-time workers are likely to become unemployed.”State-wage support in Germany dates back to 1910 and has historically focused on preserving manufacturing jobs. In 1924, a quarter of the workforce was enrolled in a program similar to today’s.While the scheme proved successful a decade ago when credit dried up and factories suffered from collapsing orders, a broad shutdown of public life to prevent the spread of Covid-19 has primarily hit services.Restaurants, hotels, and retail stores have born the brunt of more than two months of restrictions.Restaurant chain Vapiano filed for insolvency in early April, and athletic wear shop Runners Point, a subsidiary of Foot Locker, is closing down. A study by research firm Crif Buergel estimates as many as 29,000 companies will go out of business this year.Almost one in five companies surveyed by the Ifo Institute decided to reduce staff in April. At least half of all restaurants and hotels indicated they slashed jobs.“No healthy company should go bankrupt because of corona and no job should be lost.”-- German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier on March 13KfW’s Mueller estimates unemployment will rise to about 3 million in the course of 2020, an increase of some 800,000 from last year’s trough. The IAB research arm of the labor agency has a similar forecast. It also predicts a decline in the number of employed people by about 1 million.That includes hundreds of thousands of so-called “mini jobbers”: part-time workers who are particularly prevalent in services, receive a monthly salary of no more than 450 euros ($490), and aren’t eligible for the reduced-work subsidies. They are also unlikely to appear in official jobless figures -- many are pensioners, students, or homemakers who don’t usually register as unemployed.Germany, where some 6 million workers received state-wage support in April, isn’t the only country where furlough schemes appear to be showing cracks.In Austria, a hastily revamped program failed to prevent unemployment in sectors more used to hiring and firing and to seasonal employment, according to Helmut Mahringer, a labor-market economist at research institute Wifo. Joblessness has surged by 200,000 since the end of February, with 1.3 million workers on state-wage support.In Spain, close to 1 million employees -- about a quarter of those temporarily suspended from their jobs -- are still waiting for their payments, according to a survey.Last month, Germany raised the amount it pays workers whose hours have been cut by more than half. Services-sector union Ver.di complained that those increases don’t kick in until four months into furlough, and don’t address the struggles of low-income or part-time staff.That won’t prevent businesses from using the scheme, according to Enzo Weber, who leads IAB’s forecast and economic analysis division.“Companies have so far made much greater use of short-time work policies than layoffs,” he said in a phone interview. But “we’re seeing the worst economic shock since World War II, and it’s clear that despite short-time work policies it will lead to a significant number of dismissals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cracking-germany-s-defense-against-unemployment-surge/story-UGkZeW4ssMYx7wE9oYZu3N.html

26-05-2020||World||Cyclone Amphan shows cost of delaying $38 billion Bangladesh delta plan||Mizanur Rahman recalls the last time a major tropical storm hit Bangladesh, when Cyclone Sidr killed more than 3,000 people in 2007. In the aftermath of the destruction, he watched the dead body of a woman being washed ashore by the tide.“That image doesn’t go away. It keeps coming back,” Rahman, a bungalow caretaker, said in the coastal town of Patuakali in Bangladesh’s huge river delta. The district was devastated by the 2007 storm and has been hit by a series of cyclones since, the latest being Amphan, which tore into the region last week, killing about 100 people in Bangladesh and India and causing more than $13 billion in damage.In an effort to strengthen its climate resilience, the Bangladesh government in 2018 approved Delta Plan 2100, an eight-decade program combining water and land management and development. The first phase requires about $38 billion by 2030 to implement 80 projects, including 65 tied to infrastructure.Raising that money was never going to be easy, but now the program to protect the 37 million people who live in the delta is in limbo -- hit first by the coronavirus and then by the damage from Amphan. Bangladesh evacuated 2.4 million people from coastal districts, State Minister for Disaster Management Enamur Rahman said in Dhaka on May 19, the day before the storm hit.“Fundraising is a big challenge,” said Shamsul Alam, a senior secretary of the Bangladesh Planning Commission and lead author of the Delta Plan. “The coronavirus came as a huge, sudden shock. We have to readjust in the short run -- maybe for three to four budgets. We have to think carefully how we can adjust to the new situation.”If nothing is done by 2050, climate change could make another 14% of the country “extremely vulnerable” to floods and displace some 35 million people from the coastal districts. The combined effects of climate change could cost the country as much as 2% of gross domestic product per year.Dutch HelpA Dutch consortium led by consultancy Twynstra helped develop the Delta Plan, most of which is in the world’s most-populated river delta, where the waters of the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna reach the Bay of Bengal. Almost a third of the first-phase budget is earmarked for 23 coastal projects to prevent flooding, including land reclamation and building islands and polders.Bangladesh, a nation of more than 160 million people, currently invests 0.8% of GDP in water-related projects and would have to raise that to about 2.5% by 2030 to implement the projects with minimum financing, Alam said.“The coronavirus is one truth we’re facing now and climate change is another,” he said. “We need to handle these two issues in a combined way. We will emphasize our health services and go with universal health coverage, and at the same time, we need safe drinking water for health and good sanitation. These issues are interrelated.”The country has more than 35,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and already borrowed $950 million from lenders, including $600 million from the Asian Development Bank, to tackle the virus. Bangladesh increased its social protection and economic stimulus package to 1 trillion taka, or 3.6% of the country’s GDP.“The government will have to prioritize the immediate response and recovery effort over longer-term development projects,” said Joseph Parkes, Asia analyst at global risk research company Verisk Maplecroft. “We expect donors and the government to back the Delta Plan over the long run, even if the immediate focus shifts to the public-health crisis.”Bangladesh’s rapid economic growth in the past two decades, fueled by an expanding garment trade and a burgeoning information-technology industry, has helped the country improve its resilience and gave momentum to the Delta Plan.Lives LostWhen Cyclone Sidr hit in 2007, it was the strongest storm to make landfall in Bangladesh, causing damage and losses of as much as $1.7 billion, but its death toll was about 1% of the more than 300,000 lives lost in the Bhola Cyclone of 1970, the deadliest in the nation’s history.Still, Amphan shows the nation’s continued vulnerability to rising sea levels if it doesn’t improve its defenses. Storm surges from cyclones can inundate land and water supplies, causing extensive damage to livelihoods in rural areas, where about 85% of the poor live. Agriculture and fishing account for almost half the jobs in the country and support more than 70% of the population, according to the ADB.Days after the storm passed, Amir Hossain, a resident of the island of Char Montaz in the Bay of Bengal, stood on an embankment built more than a decade ago to protect the fishing district. “The tide was still two feet higher than normal,” Hossain said on May 25 as the water buffeted the sea defenses. “Without the dike, we would have been washed away.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cyclone-amphan-shows-cost-of-delaying-38-billion-bangladesh-delta-plan/story-SZ40tAZMFvyO33L1vOCwRN.html

He lamented that the government’s instructions and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to control the spread of the virus were not being followed.The warning comes weeks after Pakistan had started phase-wise easing of the nationwide lockdown earlier this month.Dr Mirza observed that apparently there was perception that threat of the coronavirus was over. “Unfortunately, there is now this thinking among us that this disease (Covid-19) was only here till Eid and that somehow it’ll disappear after Eid. This is a huge misunderstanding,” he said.Pakistan’s coronavirus cases on Monday reached 56,349 with 1,748 new patients while the death toll climbed to 1,167 after 34 people lost their lives in the last 24 hours (bwteeen Sunday and Monday).The Ministry of National Health Services reported that 22,491 cases were diagnosed in Sindh, 20,077 in Punjab, 7,905 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 3,407 in Balochistan, 1,641 in Islamabad, 619 in Gilgit-Baltistan and 209 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The authorities also had conducted 4,83,656 tests in the country, including 10,049 on Sunday.The trajectory showed that the number was steadily going up and it was feared that it would further curve up in the wake of easing of lockdown before Eid which was observed on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-rising-plan-to-reimpose-strict-lockdown-after-eid-top-pakistan-official/story-61ubcgrQjK3NSwGLbMptnJ.html

There was also a chance that infection rates could rise again more quickly if measures to halt the first wave were lifted too soon.“When we speak about a second wave classically what we often mean is there will be a first wave of the disease by itself, and then it recurs months later. And that may be a reality for many countries in a number of months’ time,” Ryan said.“But we need also to be cognizant of the fact that the disease can jump up at any time. We cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.”He said countries in Europe and North America should “continue to put in place the public health and social measures, the surveillance measures, the testing measures and a comprehensive strategy to ensure that we continue on a downwards trajectory and we don’t have an immediate second peak.”Many European countries and US states have taken steps in recent weeks to lift lockdown measures that curbed the spread of the disease but caused severe harm to economies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/get-ready-who-warns-of-second-peak-in-areas-where-covid-19-declining/story-Ea0agdxTW2HRwXnKFaL2PN.html

It’s not clear that any of the candidates ultimately will prove safe and effective. But many work in different ways, and are made with different technologies, increasing the odds that at least one approach might succeed.Most of the shots in the pipeline aim to train the immune system to recognize the “spike” protein that studs the coronavirus’ outer surface, priming the body to react if it ever encountered the real infection.

26-05-2020||World||In Bolsonaro’s Brazil, everyone else is to blame for virus||With Brazil emerging as one of the world’s most infected countries, President Jair Bolsonaro is deflecting all responsibility for the coronavirus crisis, casting blame on mayors, governors, an outgoing health minister and the media.By contrast, he portrays himself as a clear-eyed crusader willing to defend an unpopular idea — that shutting down the economy to control COVID-19 will ultimately cause more suffering than allowing the disease to run its course. The refusal of governors to fall into line with his decree allowing gyms to open, he said, verged on authoritarianism.Asked about Brazil’s death toll surpassing China’s, he feigned impotence: “I don’t work miracles. What do you want me to do?” Confronted with a travel ban imposed on Brazil by the US because of widespread COVID-19, one of his advisers called it press hysteria.Since the outbreak started, the Brazilian leader has avoided acknowledging the potential effects of his actions, particularly in undermining local leaders’ stay-at-home recommendations. A rare exception came in mid-April, as Bolsonaro appointed a new health minister tasked with sparing the economy from the coronavirus.“Reopening commerce is a risk I run because, if it (the virus) gets worse, then it lands in my lap,” he said.Less than two weeks later, as Brazil’s death toll blew past 5,000, he told reporters, “You’re not going to put on my lap this count that isn’t mine.” Almost a month on, the death toll in the country of 211 million has more than quadrupled, to 22,666, and continues to accelerate.The Brazilian Supreme Court determined that states and cities have jurisdiction to impose isolation measures. So Bolsonaro on May 7 walked purposefully across the capital’s Three Powers Plaza to the top court, a tight cluster of ministers and business leaders in tow, and demanded local restrictions be tempered.“Some states went too far in their restrictive measures, and the consequences are knocking on our door,” he said, adding that tens of millions of Brazilians have lost their income. He has repeatedly singled out some local leaders by name.When governors defied Bolsonaro’s subsequent decree that gyms, barbershops and beauty salons be allowed to operate as essential services, he accused them of undermining the rule of law and suggested the move would invite “undesirable authoritarianism to emerge in Brazil.” On Saturday night, Bolsonaro ventured into the capital of Brasilia to lead by example, this time eating a hot dog bought from a street vendor. Video he posted to Facebook showed supporters snapping selfies and calling him by his nickname — “Myth!” — while those in self-quarantine in overlooking apartments banged pots and pans in protest.A May 17-18 poll by XP/Ipespe found 58 per cent of those surveyed rated Bolsonaro’s pandemic response as bad or terrible, and only 21 per cent as good or excellent. Governors fared more than twice as well in both counts. The poll had a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points.Latin America’s largest nation has confirmed 363,000 COVID-19 cases, more than any nation except the US, and experts say that figure is a significant undercount due to insufficient testing. The strain on Brazil’s underfunded hospitals has pushed them to the brink of collapse in multiple states and prevents some patients from getting treatment.Havoc and heartache are unfolding beneath a void of leadership, according to Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazil’s Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials. Two health ministers have left office during the pandemic, making Brazil the world’s only nation that can claim such distinction, he said.Brazil is “completely incapable of dealing with and responding to this crisis as this crisis should be responded to — with complete leadership, clear messages, political stability and unity,” Lago said.“That’s not the case here. Basically, what we’re seeing is a complete lack of seriousness and competence.” The far-right leader fired his first health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, for supporting governors’ restrictions. In his departing address, Mandetta referred to Bolsonaro in what he later confirmed to magazine Época was an allusion to the Albert Camus book “The Plague.” The novel about a diseased city includes a passage that says those who did not believe in the plague were first to die because they took no precautions.Bolsonaro’s second minister, Nelson Teich, resigned about a month later after openly disagreeing with Bolsonaro over chloroquine, the predecessor of the anti-malarial often touted by US President Donald Trump as viable treatment. Bolsonaro in his 17-month tenure has often expressed open admiration for Trump and the US.Weeks after praising chloroquine and directing the Army to ramp up production, Bolsonaro admitted last week that there is no scientific evidence of its effectiveness, but said the nation is “at war,” and it is better to fight and lose than not fight at all. The country still has only an interim health minister: a general with no health experience whatsoever before April.In the capital on Sunday, pro-Bolsonaro supporters staged a small demonstration in front of the presidential palace, as they have for several weeks. Bolsonaro joined and once again lifted children in his arms.He shared a video from a helicopter flyover of the demonstration that revealed a sparsely occupied plaza. There were perhaps 1,000 people in attendance, in a city of 3 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-bolsonaro-s-brazil-everyone-else-is-to-blame-for-virus/story-ufsuq9Oa7Hx7WpqupIzBAJ.html
26-05-2020||World||Donald Trump threatens to move the GOP convention out of Charlotte due to Covid-19 restrictions||US President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to move the Republican convention out of Charlotte in North Carolina if its Democratic Governor did not remove the restrictions on social distancing measures which are in force due to coronavirus pandemic.The four-day Republican National Convention in Charlotte is scheduled to be held from August 14 to August 27 and it is here that President Trump would officially be nominated by the Republican Party for his re-election for the presidential elections on November 3.However, the once-in-a four-year convention is right now in jeopardy or expected to lose its shine because of the social distancing measures being enforced in the State by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper. The convention attracts hundreds and thousands of Trump supporters and Republican leaders from across the country wherein they pack into a giant indoor stadium for four days. “I love the Great State of North Carolina, so much so that I insisted on having the Republican National Convention in Charlotte at the end of August. Unfortunately, Democrat Governor, Roy Cooper is still in Shutdown mood & unable to guarantee that by August we will be allowed…made by many thousands of enthusiastic Republicans, and others, to head to beautiful North Carolina in August,” Trump said in a tweet.“They must be immediately given an answer by the Governor as to whether or not the space will be allowed to be fully occupied. If not, we will be reluctantly forced... to find, with all of the jobs and economic development it brings, another Republican National Convention site. This is not something I want to do,” Trump said. Immediately thereafter, Cooper tweeted that State health officials are working with the Republican National Committee and will review its plans as they make decisions about how to hold the convention in Charlotte. “North Carolina is relying on data and science to protect our State’s public health and safety,” Cooper said. The US has so far witnessed over 98,000 deaths due to coronavirus that has infected over 1.69 million people, according to Johns Hopkins University.
