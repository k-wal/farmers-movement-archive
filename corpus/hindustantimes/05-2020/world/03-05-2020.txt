These are usually not freely available to visitors on temporary visas. The Indian high commission on Sunday coordinated an interaction by video-link with diaspora groups such as the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (Bapio), Jain Vishwa Bharti, Friends of India Society International and the Indian National Students Association. A large number of Indian-origin professionals work in Britain’s health system. According to Ramesh Mehta, president of Bapio, the group’s members have been giving prescriptions and holding consultations with the stranded Indians without charging fee. The medicines are provided by a Bristol-based pharmacy that dispenses and posts medicines on a no-profit basis.“We are delighted to support the hundreds of stranded Indian travellers and students who need medical help, and will continue to do so until it is needed. No fee is charged by our medical professionals”, Mehta said.Thousands of Indians have registered with the high commission in a list of people who are stranded and need to return home. Charter flights are expected to be organised later this month, with those in emergency situation offered priority.Rohit Wadhwana of the high commission said: “We have facilitated prescriptions, and Indians who needed the medicines were able to get them. Some had illnesses that needed continuing provision of medicines. Many had stock for their travel period but now that the lockdown has been extended it is over. Some need examination, consultation”, he added.The Boris Johnson government has extended until May 31 the visa for free of Indians whose period has or is expiring until then, while the high commission and diaspora groups and individuals have been extending a range of services to the stranded Indians, including financial and legal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-stranded-ailing-indians-in-uk-offered-medical-aid/story-I7QOPzKwbchRoKZvmSc2DK.html
03-05-2020||World||Islamic State prisoners riot again in northeast Syria||Militants from the Islamic State group rioted in a northeast Syrian prison Sunday, a month after similar violence at the facility allowed four extremists to escape, an opposition war monitor and a Kurdish activist collective said.Kurdish forces sent reinforcements to the prison in the eastern Hassakeh province and U.S. military helicopters flew overhead, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, and North Press Agency, a media platform operating in the Kurdish-administered areas.Kurdish authorities currently operate more than two dozen detention facilities scattered across northeastern Syria, holding about 10,000 IS fighters. Among the detainees are some 2,000 foreigners whose home countries have refused to repatriate them, including about 800 Europeans.Further details were not immediately available on the size of the riot, and it was not clear if the unrest was triggered by concerns about the coronavirus’s potential spread in the prison.In late March, two days of riots broke out at the same facility when former IS members began knocking down doors and making holes in the walls between cells. Four prisoners escaped but were caught a day later.The riots were put down by the Kurdish-led, U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. Afterward, the SDF’s top commander Mazloum Abdi urged the home countries of foreign fighters to find a solution for the prisoners. The riot was one of the most serious uprisings by the prisoners since IS was defeated a year ago, when the SDF seized control of the last sliver of land controlled by the extremists in eastern Syria.A resurgence of IS attacks in both Syria and Iraq has raised concerns that the militant group is taking advantage of governments absorbed in tackling the coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing slide into economic chaos.Last month, the U.S.-led coalition said it had handed over hygiene and medical supplies to detention facilities across northeastern Syria, such as hand-washing stations, disinfectant wipes, face masks and examination gloves.One coronavirus death was reported in Kurdish-held areas of Syria in April. The central government in Damascus has registered 43 cases and three deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamic-state-prisoners-riot-again-in-northeast-syria/story-sFFWk6dvuVD4bvPxUsEfPL.html
03-05-2020||World||European leaders unveil plans to raise $8 billion for Covid-19 treatments and vaccine||The European Union and its partners will host an international pledging conference on May 4 to raise $8 billion to kick-start global cooperation on effective diagnostics, treatments and a vaccine for Covid-19. European Council President Charles Michel, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg issued a joint appeal on Sunday for contributions to the Coronavirus global response.Saudi Arabia, the current president of the G20, on Sunday pledged $500 million to support the fundraising efforts and said it will co-lead the global response.“The pledging event aims to raise funds for the immediate need of $8 billion, which the Global Preparedness and Monitoring Board stated is urgently required to develop and deliver a Covid-19 vaccine, along with diagnostics and therapeutic resources,” said a statement from the Saudi government.People familiar with developments said the Indian government is yet to take a call in participating in the drive.The European leaders said in a statement that they intended to raise the initial $8 billion to make up a global funding shortfall estimated by the Global Preparedness and Monitoring Board and others. “The funds that we raise will kick-start an unprecedented global cooperation between scientists and regulators, industry and governments, international organisations, foundations and healthcare professionals,” the statement said.All the funds will be channelled through recognised global health organisations such as CEPI, Gavi, Vaccines Alliance, Global Fund and Unitaid to develop and deploy as “quickly as possible, for as many as possible, the diagnostics, treatments and vaccines that will help the world overcome the pandemic”, it added.The European leaders said they will also support the World Health Organization and join forces with entities such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust for developing diagnostics and treatment.“While some are cautiously emerging from lockdown, others are still in isolation and see their daily social and economic lives severely restricted. Consequences could be particularly dramatic in Africa and the Global South as a whole,” the statement said.“But what we all have in common is that none of us can really think or plan ahead with any great certainty about what the future of the pandemic really holds,” it said, emphasising the need for joint efforts against the pandemic. The European leaders said they were building on the commitment by G20 leaders to develop a “massive and coordinated response to the virus” and had launched the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) accelerator, a global platform to scale-up research, development, access and equitable distribution of a vaccine and other life-saving therapeutics and diagnostics treatments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-leaders-unveil-plans-to-raise-8-billion-for-covid-19-treatments-and-vaccine/story-0VTm6WVcjF98reWwViZwPO.html
03-05-2020||World||US prisons hit by Covid-19 infections, fatalities||US prisons that hold the world’s largest population of incarcerated people have been hit by a wave of Covid-19 infections and fatalities and appear to be particularly vulnerable as an institution, according to multiple experts and bodies tracking their spiraling numbers.More than 14,400 inmates have been infected by the coronavirus and over 215 have been killed, according to the Marshall Project, a non-partisan news organisation that tracks the US criminal justice system. Official numbers as reported by the Bureau of Prisons, the federal body that runs and manages prison, 1,919 have been infected and 37 killed. There are 1,41,310 inmates in federally-managed institutions and 10,820 in community-based facilities in all; and 36,000 staff members,Reasons for the spiraling infections are clear. Inmates live in tight spaces, and mid low levels of hygiene. And they have suffered from the same shortages of essential medical supplies as the rest of the country. Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal complained of a shortage of testing supplies and said that quarantining remains difficult, AFP news agency reported. “We don’t have the option to close our doors or pick who or when someone is sent to our custody.”Reports are rising numbers of infections and fatalities in US prions come amidst reopening of the rest of the country as number of new cases have continued to decline, and hospitalization and intubation has dropped.The death toll rose to 66,415 Sunday morning with 1,426 in the last 24 hours, which is far lower than the more than 4,000 at the peak mid-April, and the number of cases went up to 1.13 million; up by 29,078 .While pressure have mounted for reopening the country, with President Donald Trump at the forefront, experts are urgently flagging concerns. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the president’s task force on the coronavirus outbreak, told Fox News Sunday, she was disturbed the protestors who swamped the state assembly in Michigan’s capital, Lansing, last week, some of whom were armed with guns. President Trump has backed them.“It’s devastatingly worrisome to me personally because if they go home and they infect their grandmother or grandfather who has a co-morbid condition and they have a serious or very unfortunate outcome, they will feel guilty for the rest of their lives. So we need to protect each other at the same time as we’re voicing our discontent,” she said.In another development, Republican and Democratic leaders of US congress have jointly — in rare bipartisanship — rejected the White House’s offer of instant testing kits for lawmakers. The senate is scheduled to return to work on Monday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said in a joint statement, the testing kits on offer can be used better among frontline workers dealing with the outbreak.“No reason to turn it down, except politics,” Trump hit back in a tweet. “We have plenty of testing. Maybe you need a new doctor over there. Crazy Nancy will use it as an excuse not to show up to work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prisons-hit-by-covid-19-infections-fatalities/story-I9zvLXjrFzpSQoVcKqPBnK.html

03-05-2020||World||Russia sees record rise as virus cases surge past 130,000||Russia on Sunday reported a new record daily rise in coronavirus infections as the number of confirmed cases surged past 130,000.As some European countries were looking to gradually lift restrictions, officials in Moscow -- the epicentre of the contagion in Russia -- urged residents to stay home despite glorious weather.With the number of cases rising by several thousand each day, Russia is now the European country registering the most new infections.Despite the increases, the government has indicated it could gradually lift confinement measures from May 12, depending on the region.According to the government’s daily coronavirus update, 10,633 confirmed infections were reported in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 134,687.President Vladimir Putin has said the situation remains “very difficult” and warned that the country was not yet past the peak of the outbreak.Russia’s official fatality rate has remained low in comparison to countries like Italy, Spain and the United States.Fifty-eight people died over the past 24 hours, bringing the total toll to 1,280.The authorities are preparing to set up temporary field hospitals around Moscow including at the VDNKh, the famed Soviet-era outdoor exhibition centre, in case infections continue to surge.Muscovites have been under lockdown since March 30 and in mid-April, the authorities introduced a system of digital permits to reduce violations of the restrictions.They have warned that the rules may be tightened further.Residents of the Russian capital are only allowed to leave their homes to walk their dogs, take out trash and visit their nearest shop although private car journeys have not been restricted up to now.Many complained that it was increasingly difficult to observe the quarantine as the weather was getting warmer.In a sprawling park in southwest Moscow on Sunday, a two-person police patrol asked parents with small children to respect the confinement rules and return home.‘Threat on the rise’ Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Saturday urged residents to continue to respect stay-at-home rules and other measures over the long May holidays.“The threat is apparently on the rise,” Sobyanin said on his blog.Earlier this week Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Construction Minister Vladimir Yakushev tested positive for the coronavirus and were hospitalised.Mishustin’s first deputy Andrei Belousov is now serving as acting prime minister.Mishustin’s spokesman Boris Belyakov told reporters on Sunday that the prime minister was feeling fine and was in touch with his colleagues.The health ministry said on Friday that the number of infected children was on the rise. Two children had died from the coronavirus and 11 more were in a serious condition.Moscow alone has recorded 5,948 new cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the capital’s total to 68,606.Sobyanin said about two percent of Moscow residents -- or more than 250,000 people -- have the coronavirus.According to official statistics, Moscow has a population of 12.7 million but the real figure is believed to be higher.Putin has postponed a landmark military parade to honour the 75th anniversary of Soviet victory in World War II on May 9.He has also postponed an April vote on constitutional reforms that could allow the 67-year-old Kremlin chief to potentially stay in power until 2036.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-sees-record-rise-as-virus-cases-surge-past-130-000/story-y4zPZvLwmUmLhOy50Z8JPL.html
03-05-2020||World||Tens of thousands evacuated after Uzbekistan dam bursts||Uzbek authorities on Sunday launched a criminal probe after a major dam burst, prompting the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from flooded homes there and in Kazakhstan. The wall of the Sardoba reservoir dam in eastern Uzbekistan burst early on Friday and at least 70,000 people have been evacuated. More than 50 people were hospitalised. Over 600 homes in southern Kazakhstan have also been flooded.Uzbekistan’s state prosecutor said on Sunday that a criminal case had been opened into “official negligence” and construction violations. Construction of the Sardoba dam began in 2010 under the supervision of current President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who was prime minister at the time. It was completed in 2017. Mirziyoyev on Friday flew to the region, which saw strong winds and rains prior to the collapse of the dam, in order to oversee the evacuation and cleanup operation. Officials in Kazakhstan’s southern Turkestan region, where more than 5,000 people have been evacuated so far, criticised Uzbekistan for not providing timely information on the status of flood control Saturday.“We have a copy of our correspondence with the Uzbek side, that as of (8 pm on Friday) the situation was stable and there were no problems,” said Saken Kalkamanov, deputy governor of the Turkestan region.“They said that not a drop of water would reach Maktaraal district,” he said, referring to the area where the flood hit. “Nevertheless, what happened has happened.”The administration of the Turkestan region estimated that the floods caused crop damage worth more than $400,000 -- mostly to the cotton, which is grown throughout the Central Asian region. sk-cr/as/wdb||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tens-of-thousands-evacuated-after-uzbekistan-dam-bursts/story-CKcV9EGD2nqGo9xguUsDMP.html
03-05-2020||World||In a random Covid test, one-third of Afghanistan’s population detected positive||One-third of 500 random coronavirus tests in Afghanistan’s capital came back positive, health officials said Sunday, raising fears of widespread undetected infections in one of the world’s most fragile states.Neighboring Iran, meanwhile, said it would reopen schools and mosques in some locations, even though the nation has been the regional epicenter of the pandemic since mid-February.The results of the random tests in the Afghan capital of Kabul are “concerning,” said Public Health Ministry spokesman Wahid Mayar. Afghanistan has performed only limited testing so far — close to 12,000, with more than 2,700 confirmed infections, in a nation of 36.6 million.As more testing becomes available, the country’s confirmed infection numbers will likely rise sharply, said Mayar. He urged residents to stay home. Kabul and most other cities are in lockdown, but compliance has not been widespread.The death toll — officially at 85 — could also be much higher.More than 250,000 Afghans returned home from Iran since the beginning of the year, fanning out across their country without being tested or quarantined. Anecdotal reports have emerged of dozens of returnees dying of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.At a recent briefing, a senior government official said 40 people died of the virus in Sarobi district, barely 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Kabul. The Health Ministry said it could not confirm the claim.The country’s health care system, devastated by four decades of war, is woefully unprepared for a major outbreak. It has only 400 ventilators.The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.Testing in Afghanistan has been sporadic and some of those infected have been hiding their symptoms, in part because of local stigma. In parts of the country, there have been reports of Covid-19 patients being shunned by their neighbours and even refused food from the local markets.The government, embroiled in political turmoil, has also faced criticism for responding too slowly to the crisis. Only recently, the government started testing in western Herat province where the hundreds of thousands of returnees from Iran have transited.Afghanistan has two presidents, both of whom claim to have won last year’s election. American efforts to find a compromise have failed, causing U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to threaten to cut $1 billion in aid.The bickering has also delayed implementation of a U.S.-Taliban peace deal signed in February to allow Washington to end its longest military engagement, end Afghanistan’s decades of war and bring more than 12,000 U.S. soldiers home.In Iran, authorities said Sunday that 47 people had died in the preceding 24-hour period, the lowest daily toll in two months. Still, Iran remains the hardest-hit country in the Middle East, with more than 97,000 cases and more than 6,200 deaths.President Hassan Rouhani announced Sunday that schools and mosques would reopen in some low-risk locations. Schools and universities have been shut down since late February.Also Sunday, the U.N. children’s agency urged six countries in the Middle East to green-light special polio and measles vaccination campaigns that were put on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic.Currently, nearly 10.5 million children under the age of five are at risk of missing their polio vaccination, UNICEF said. Nearly 4.5 million children under the age of 15 could miss their measles vaccinations.Routine vaccinations for other diseases such as rubella and diphtheria are continuing, but special campaigns for polio and measles were put on hold in some countries because health systems were overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic or governments wanted to avoid crowding at clinics.The polio campaigns are on hold in Syria, Sudan, Yemen and Iraq, while measles vaccinations are suspended in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and Djibouti, the agency said.In Israel, the city of Tel Aviv announced it is postponing its annual gay pride parade, along with those in the cities of Haifa, Jerusalem and Beersheba. The annual event in Tel Aviv, which was scheduled for early June, drew over 250,000 people in 2019, making it one of the largest in the Mideast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-random-covid-test-one-third-of-afghanistan-s-population-detected-positive/story-0F4vOY4hdTM9G7bXk1LvGL.html
03-05-2020||World||Journalism has effectively become a crime in Egypt in past 4 years: Report||Journalism in Egypt has effectively become a crime over the past four years, as authorities clamp down on media outlets and muzzle dissent, Amnesty International said in a report released Sunday.As the number of coronavirus infections in Egypt continues to rise, the government is strengthening its control over information, the London-based rights group said, instead of upholding transparency during the public health crisis.“The Egyptian authorities have made it very clear that anyone who challenges the official narrative will be severely punished,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty’s Middle East and North Africa director.Amnesty documented 37 cases of journalists detained in the government’s escalating crackdown on press freedoms, many charged with “spreading false news” or “misusing social media” under a broad 2015 counterterrorism law that has expanded the definition of terror to include all kinds of dissent.An Egyptian press officer did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment, but authorities have previously denied rights violations and justified arrests on national security grounds.Following general-turned-president Abdel Fattah el-Sissi’s rise to power in 2013, most of Egypt’s television programs and newspapers have taken the government position and steered clear of criticism, or else disappeared. Many privately owned Egyptian news outlets have been quietly acquired by companies affiliated with the country’s intelligence service.But even a pro-government voice hasn’t spared 12 journalists working for state-owned media outlets, who have landed in jail for expressing various private views on social media, the report said.One of them is Atef Hasballah, editor-in-chief of the AlkararPress website. When he challenged the Health Ministry’s coronavirus case count on his Facebook page last month, he was promptly bundled into a police van and detained on suspicion of “joining a terrorist organization.”Egypt’s public prosecutor warned in a recent statement that those who spread “false news” about the coronavirus may face up to five years imprisonment and steep fines. At least 12 individuals have been caught up in the COVID-19-motivated crackdown so far, according to Amnesty. Last month, authorities blocked a local news site that covered calls by activists to release political prisoners over fears of the coronavirus spreading in Egypt’s crowded prisons. Separately, Egypt expelled a correspondent for The Guardian newspaper over an article that indicated the coronavirus infection rate may be higher than officially reported.The journalists interviewed by Amnesty reported increasingly direct state intervention in their coverage. Many working for government-owned or aligned papers said they receive specific instructions via WhatsApp on what to report and to omit. For instance, a directive on how to handle President Donald Trump’s proposal to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict this year asked reporters not to mention the plan’s violations of long-standing Arab policies, as Trump and el-Sissi have cultivated close ties.Those who do not hew the official line, such as by praising prison conditions and smearing the state’s political opponents, “lost their jobs, were interrogated or imprisoned,” one journalist was quoted as saying. “I cannot even imagine that someone could refuse to comply.”Marking World Press Freedom Day, Amnesty urged Egyptian authorities to halt their censorship, harassment and intimidation of journalists — and to release those detained “solely for carrying out their work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/journalism-has-effectively-become-a-crime-in-egypt-in-past-4-years-report/story-4tfheKeFyRL9x1AzpqTu8M.html
03-05-2020||World||Millions travel in China during May Day holidays as tourism, travel open up||In what appears to be the clearest sign yet of the coronavirus outbreak having abated in China, where it first emerged late last year, millions of Chinese are travelling within the country for the May Day holidays.Over 50 million trips were made in the first two days of the five-day holiday, state media reports said, adding that an estimated 90 million trips are expected to be completed by the end of holidays on Tuesday.Of the 50 million trips, nearly 23 million domestic tourist trips were made by Friday, the first day of the holiday, with the domestic tourism revenue reaching over 9.7 billion yuan (about $1.38 billion), according to the ministry of culture and tourism (MCT).The increase in domestic tourism comes after China lowered its epidemic emergency response to the second or lower categories from the most serious one.A total of 8,498 A-level tourist attractions across the country were opened to the public by Friday, covering about 70 percent of the total, said the ministry.The surge in tourism comes in the backdrop of a dramatic drop in Covid-19 cases in China, including in the once worst-hit Hubei province, and its capital Wuhan city, where the virus first emerged late last year.Chinese health authority on Sunday said that it received reports of two new confirmed Covid-19 cases on the Chinese mainland Saturday, including an imported case.As of Saturday, the overall confirmed cases on the mainland reached 82,877 and altogether 4,633 people had died of the disease, the National Health Commission (NHC) said.Authorities, however, are keeping a cap on the number of tourists – usually at around 30 percent – at many tourist places.Marking this significant trend for the nation, China’s big cities seems to be leading the surge in tourismAfter Beijing moved to announce that it would lower the public health emergency response from level one to level two effective April 30, flight bookings went up.The ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) is hoping that the increase in domestic tourism will be among the first steps to boost the economy, which contracted year-on-year for the first time in more than four decades in the first quarter of 2020.Despite the increase in tourism over the weekend, it remains much lower than corresponding volumes for other years – both the volume and revenue are expected to contract despite an extra-day of holiday this year.“China saw 195 million tourist trips during the four-day holiday that ended on Saturday, a year-on-year increase of 13.7 percent, according to the MCT. The surge of travelers pushed tourism revenue to almost 117.67 billion yuan ($17.5 billion) nationwide, a 16.1 percent increase over last year,” the state-controlled China Daily reported in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millions-travel-in-china-during-may-day-holidays-as-tourism-travel-open-up/story-gPx8EDubvzsN59bth6tYfO.html

Some people, especially the elderly and vulnerable, found themselves stuck without food or medical supplies.Elmihnida volunteered to do grocery shopping and fetch medication for those in need.His phone is constantly ringing with calls from neighbours or friends who know of other people seeking help. He writes down their grocery and medical requests and, armed with his permit to leave the lockdown, does their shopping.He’s been helping others since he left prison a dozen years ago.Ashamed of his life of crime and drugs, he wanted more than a fresh start.He wanted to make up for the pain he had inflicted on his loved ones. He had lost the respect of his community, his parents and his friends.“My parents were ashamed of me and my actions, and I needed to make things right,” the 37-year-old said.He left prison determined not to return, and embraced “the idea of reconciliation, first with my parents who were affected the most, then with the community I grew up in.” Together with other ex-convicts and some volunteers, he worked to make life better in El Youssoufia, a densely populated, crime-ridden neighbourhood. They cleaned, painted and softened the urban grime with plantings.And then, when the virus hit, he expanded his efforts.“Noureddine is a kind man,” said his 60-year-old neighbor, too shy to identify himself by name. “He has helped deliver stuff to us without charge. When I couldn’t collect my medicine from the clinic, he did. God bless him.” Those services won the former convict recognition among more well-off residents who make donations — money that Elmihnida distributes to the poor.“I swore to God not to take any money for my services,” he said.On April 5, the Justice Ministry announced a pardon by King Mohammed VI for 5,654 prisoners to limit the spread of the virus in prisons.Mohsen Harmati, one of those set free, began volunteering that day with Elmihnida.“Noureddine was a troublemaker for 10 years, but he’s a changed man now. He has helped paint the neighborhood and plant it, and now he’s helping people at the most needy of times,” Harmati said.All that work continues. And Elmihnida also checks on migrants who camp out in the neighbourhood, their dreams of trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Spain scuttled by border closures.Elmihnida knows that his constant errands increase his risk of becoming infected with the coronavirus. Morocco has nearly 4,730 cases confirmed and 173 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.“But God will protect me because he knows I’m helping people without expecting a payback,” Elmihnida said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-convict-helps-neighbours-cope-in-morocco-virus-lockdown/story-UXPknanpm6qYwIy1bman1J.html

Some cross-country research is already underway to develop a safe, effective vaccine, and scientists and doctors in various nations have been sharing experiences in using different drugs to treat patients.The pope also invited faithful of all religions to spiritually unite in prayer, fasting and works of charity on May 14 to “implore God to help humanity to overcome the coronavirus pandemic”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-calls-for-international-cooperation-on-finding-coronavirus-vaccine/story-uy6GBTeoYNisOWPbA9Y2pO.html

Thank you!”Now Trump wants to extend that claim to great leadership by asking voters to put behind them the tragic events of the last months and to focus on his promise of “spectacular” economic recovery.The virus -- which has killed more than 66,000 Americans -- continues to inflict havoc against a background of mass unemployment, trillions of dollars in emergency government aid, and worries about a second viral wave after the summer.But Trump, tapping his salesman’s optimism, says the nightmare will end soon.“We built the greatest economy the world has ever seen,” the president said last week. “And we’re going to do it again. And it’s not going to be that long, OK?”To underline this patriotic self-confidence, he announced a series of flyovers by the military display team, the Blue Angels, including one over Washington, DC, on Saturday.Fanning the flamesDespite Trump’s eagerness to get the economy -- and his re-election hopes -- moving, medical experts warn premature reopening could bring a disastrous resurgence.On the other side, the president is pressured by many ordinary Americans whose livelihoods are under dire threat.Faced with these conflicting tensions, he has increasingly sided with Republican leaders who advocate re-opening as quickly as possible.As the decision on whether to reopen becomes ever more politicized, Trump has encouraged street protests against the lockdown.Tweeting that protesters should “LIBERATE” states and calling demonstrators in Michigan -- who included armed and camouflaged militia members -- “very good people”, he is staking out electoral territory.And while he pushes the patriotic themes inside the country, Trump is also amping up criticism on China, where the virus originated, as a foreign opponent.Beijing, he told Reuters last week, “will do anything they can” to stop his reelection -- an accusation likely to be repeated often.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-to-take-pandemic-victory-lap-in-tv-town-hall/story-gNCr7j9ug4pQQOBfM2LqYL.html

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.Rights groups say hundreds of Rohingya are stranded on at least two fishing trawlers between Bangladesh and Malaysia. The refugees reportedly attempted to illegally reach Malaysia, but failed because of strict patrols to keep out the coronavirus.More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims came to Bangladesh starting in August 2017, when the military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar began a harsh crackdown against them in response to an attack by insurgents. Global rights groups and the U.N. have called the campaign ethnic cleansing involving rapes, killings and torching of thousands of homes. Currently more than 1 million Rohingya live in Bangladesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rohingya-refugees-floating-at-sea-for-weeks-land-on-bangladesh-island/story-cfzFb8BZykBNtUXG9LZJMM.html
03-05-2020||World||Top Israel court hears bids to bar Netanyahu from forming new govt||Israel’s top court Sunday started hearing arguments to bar Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from forming a new government as he faces a criminal trial on corruption charges.The Supreme Court will also hear petitions challenging a coalition deal with his rival-turned-partner Benny Gantz, who is currently speaker of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. Either case carries with it the danger of forcing another election, after three polls in less than a year failed to produce a government and left the country in a grinding political deadlock.“Today we shall hear arguments on the question of bestowing the duty of forming a government on a Knesset member against whom an indictment has been filed,” Chief Justice Esther Hayut said as she opened proceedings.“Tomorrow there will be a hearing on the second issue, regarding the coalition agreement,” she said, sitting at the head of a panel of 11 judges, all wearing face masks in line with COVID-19 precautions.The hearing was broadcast live on the court website. Neither Netanyahu, the right-wing premier in power since 2009, nor the centrist ex-military chief Gantz, was able after a March election to form a viable governing coalition in the deeply divided 120-seat Knesset. They agreed to a power-sharing deal last month, aiming to avert a fourth poll that is opposed across the political spectrum.Netanyahu indictmentsUnder the three-year coalition deal, the government’s first six months will be dedicated primarily to combatting the novel coronavirus that has infected more than 16,000 Israelis and ravaged the economy.But eight separate petitions to the Supreme Court seek to declare the deal illegal, including one from former Gantz ally Yair Lapid, head of the opposition Yesh Atid. Lapid broke with Gantz last month when the ex-military commander was elected parliament speaker and decided to pursue a deal with Netanyahu.Hundreds of Israelis demonstrated against the deal in Tel Aviv on Saturday, the latest in a series of protests over a unity government.Sunday’s court session deals with indictments filed against Netanyahu in January. The veteran premier has been charged with accepting improper gifts and illegally trading favours in exchange for favourable media coverage. He denies wrongdoing and his trial is set to start May 24.Israeli law bars an indicted person from serving as an ordinary cabinet minister, but does not compel a criminally-charged prime minister to leave office. The complication regarding Netanyahu is that he is not currently an ordinary prime minister. He has been serving as the caretaker head of a transitional government through Israel’s period of political deadlock.According to some interpretations of Israeli law, that makes Netanyahu merely a candidate to become prime minister. Interviewed on public radio Saturday, energy minister and Netanyahu ally Yuval Steinitz said that if the court rules Netanyahu cannot serve, it would amount to “an unprecedented attack on Israeli democracy”. The Gantz-Netanyahu agreement, Steinitz said, is “a necessity, the result of three election campaigns and a desire among Israelis to avoid a fourth election”.The deal’s termsThe main argument against the coalition deal concerns specific provisions opponents say violate the law. The agreement sees Netanyahu serving as prime minister for 18 months, with Gantz as his “alternate”, a new title in Israeli governance. They will swap roles midway through the deal before likely taking voters back to the polls in 36 months. But Israeli law traditionally endows governments with four-year mandates, an issue pounced on by the deal’s opponents. There is also a provision freezing certain public appointments during the government’s initial six-month pandemic emergency phase, which critics also say is illegal.An opinion delivered to the Supreme Court this week by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who indicted Netanyahu, said that while “certain arrangements in the coalition agreement raise major difficulties... at this time there are no grounds to disqualify (it).”He advised that problematic provisions be reviewed “at the implementation stage”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-israel-court-hears-bids-to-bar-netanyahu-from-forming-new-govt/story-GgYe5UteAfEyaCwnc4p7yJ.html

At least 175,423 applicants have signed up from the UAE,” Norka said in an official statement on Saturday.It also received 54,305 registrations from Saudi Arabia, 2,437 from the UK, 2,255 from the US, and 1,958 from Ukraine from those who wish to return to India, the Khaleej Times reported. The coronavirus has infected 13,599 people and claimed 119 lives in the UAE, the Ministry of Health and Prevention said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-150-000-indians-in-uae-register-to-return-home/story-MHV00A2epVIf5X0Ewt2OlO.html
03-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Mosques and schools to reopen in Iran’s low-risk areas||Iran plans to reopen mosques and schools in areas that have been consistently free of the coronavirus as President Hassan Rouhani’s government starts to ease restrictions that were aimed at containing the outbreak.With mosques closed and religious gatherings banned since mid-March as the outbreak spread in the Middle East’s worst-hit country, ordinary Iranians have turned to drive-ins for ceremonies during the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.State TV and videos on social media showed people in their cars watching a religious ceremony on a big screen in a Tehran car park.“Mosques will reopen in 132 low-risk or ‘white cities’ and towns from Monday. Friday prayer sermons will resume in those areas as well ... However, all these steps will be taken by respecting the health protocols,” Rouhani said in a televised meeting.Iran’s health ministry has divided the country into white, yellow and red areas based on the number of infections and deaths.The ministry said on Saturday that the trajectory of infections has started a “gradual” downward trend in Iran, where the death toll is 6,156 and total number of diagnosed cases has reached 96,448.Iran has already lifted a ban on inter-city trips and malls, with large shopping centres resuming activities despite warnings by some health officials of a new wave of infections.School and university closures were maintained and cultural and sports gatherings are also still banned, though Rouhani said the plan is for some schools to reopen soon.“The schools in the white and low-risk areas will reopen from May 16 ... However, we will continue to review the situation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-mosques-and-schools-to-reopen-in-iran-s-low-risk-areas/story-Q5FOBdhszwy12YwDmcPTwJ.html
03-05-2020||World||Emerging from lockdown: ‘46 days in the house was enough’||From the United States to Europe and Asia, people in many parts of the world are emerging from their homes as virus-related restrictions begin to ease and springtime temperatures climb. But the global pandemic took a turn for the worse in other places. India on Sunday reported more than 2,600 new cases, its biggest single-day jump. That followed record increases in neighboring Pakistan and Russia the previous day. There was also worrying news from Afghanistan, where about a third tested positive in a random test.China, which reported two new cases, is seeing a surge in visitors to tourist spots, many newly reopened, after domestic travel restrictions were relaxed ahead of a five-day holiday that runs through Tuesday.Nearly 1.7 million people visited Beijing parks on the first two days of the holiday, and Shanghai’s main tourist spots welcomed more than a million visitors, according to Chinese media reports. Many spots limited the number of daily visitors to 30% of capacity or less, keeping crowds below average.Masks were worn widely around the world, from runners in Spain to beach-goers in the southern United States. In New York City’s Central Park, joggers moved past each other without a glance on Saturday, and a steady stream of folks left tips for a trio working their way through a set of jazz standards alfresco.“It’s great to have an audience after all these weeks,” saxophonist Julia Banholzer, a native of Germany, said. “All my dates have been canceled through September, and I don’t know if any will come back this year. New York is a tough place, but this is just another tough period we need to get through.”Neighboring New Jersey reopened state parks, though several had to turn people away after reaching a 50% limit in their parking lots. Margie Roebuck and her husband were among the first on the sand at Island Beach State Park. “Forty-six days in the house was enough,” she said.In Spain, many ventured out Saturday for the first time since a lockdown began on March 14.“I feel good, but tired. You sure notice that it has been a month and I am not in shape,” Cristina Palomeque said in Barcelona. “Some people think it may be too early, as I do, but it is also important to do exercise for health reasons.”Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez asked citizens to remain vigilant. COVID-19 has caused more than 25,100 deaths in Spain.“Until we have a vaccine, we are going to see more outbreaks,” Sánchez said. “What we need to guarantee is that these outbreaks do not put our national health system in danger.”The divide in the United States between those who want lockdowns to end and those who want to move cautiously extended to Congress.The Republican-majority Senate will reopen Monday, while the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives stays shuttered. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s decision to convene 100 senators gives President Donald Trump, a Republican, the imagery he wants of America getting back to work, despite health worries and a lack of testing.In India, air force helicopters showered flower petals on hospitals in several cities Sunday to thank doctors, nurses and police who have been at the forefront of the battle against the pandemic. U.S. Navy and Air Force fighter jets flew over Atlanta, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., on Saturday in honor of health care workers.The number of confirmed cases in India neared 40,000 as the country of 1.3 billion people marked the 40th day of a nationwide lockdown that has upended lives and millions of jobs. The official death toll reached 1,301.Afghanistan’s health ministry said Sunday that 156 people were confirmed positive out of 500 randomly tested in Kabul, the capital. Ministry spokesman Wahid Mayar called the results concerning and said that more cases would surely be found if the government was able to conduct more tests.Russia announced 9,633 new cases Saturday, and Pakistan, nearly 1,300, both one-day highs. More than half of Russia’s new cases were in Moscow, which is considering establishing temporary hospitals at sports complexes and shopping malls to deal with the influx of patients.The virus has killed more than 240,000 people worldwide, including more than 66,000 in the United States and more than 24,000 each in Italy, Britain, France and Spain, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Health experts warn a second wave of infections could hit unless testing is expanded dramatically.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and those with health problems, it can cause severe illness such as pneumonia, or death.There are economic factors to consider as well. The shutdown of businesses has plunged the global economy into its deepest slump since the 1930s and wiped out millions of jobs.Singapore announced Saturday it will let selected businesses reopen from May 12 in a cautious rollback of a two-month partial lockdown, and Sri Lanka said the government and private sector should resume work from May 11 “to ensure a return to normalcy in civilian life and to revive the economy.”Bangladesh, which opened thousands of garment factories last month, confirmed 552 new cases on Saturday. The South Asian country’s health care system is fragile, and authorities say they would not be able to provide ventilation and intensive care support for more than 500 people at one time.___Porter reported from New York.

03-05-2020||World||UK doctor alerts Indians to poor diet link with Covid-19 deaths||Poor diet is a major cause behind the Covid-19 deaths and the Indians must urgently cut down on ultra-processed food to build resilience against the deadly virus, a leading Indian-origin cardiologist in the UK has cautioned. Dr Aseem Malhotra, who is among the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) frontline medics and also a professor of evidence based medicine, said that obesity and excess weight were the “elephant in the room” that need to be addressed as a major factor behind the deaths from the coronavirus. “India is particularly vulnerable, having a very high prevalence of lifestyle related diseases,” says the 42-year-old medic, who is on a mission to spread awareness around lifestyle changes as a major weapon in the fight against coronavirus.“Specifically, conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease are three of the major risk factors for death from Covid-19. This is rooted in excess body fat, a cluster of conditions known as a metabolic syndrome,” he noted. Western countries such as the US and the UK have seen some of the highest death rates from Covid-19 in the world, which are likely to correlate with unhealthy lifestyles. “The elephant in the room is that the baseline general health in many Western populations was already in a horrendous state to begin with. In the UK and US, more than 60 per cent of adults are overweight or obese,” he pointed out.In the US, less than one in eight people are metabolically healthy, which means having normal blood pressure, having a weight circumference if you are a man less than a 102cm and less than 88cm for a woman and healthy levels of blood sugar and good cholesterol. “There’s no such thing as a healthy weight, only a healthy person. If people try to maintain all these metabolic health parameters through a healthy lifestyle, this could potentially be achieved within a few weeks of just a change of diet,” says Malhotra, who is from New Delhi.A recent report in the ‘Nature’ science journal revealed that patients with Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome might have up to 10 times greater risk of death when they contract Covid-19 and called for mandatory glucose and metabolic control of Type 2 diabetes patients to improve outcomes. Malhotra warns that the medications that are used for Type 2 diabetes and many of the other conditions have “very, very marginal effects” in terms of improving lifespan or reducing risk of death, which most people are not made aware of, and they also come with side effects.“This is not to say that medications should be discontinued but the lifestyle changes are considerably more impactful on health and will reduce the need for medication. The positive news is that you can reverse this, but it is not being made aware to patients or practised by the majority of physicians as lifestyle prescriptions in India,” he said. Based on his own clinical experience and also reflected across medical literature, the expert recommends giving up ultra-processed foods, which covers any packaged food that comes with five or more ingredients, because usually these are high in sugar, starch, unhealthy oils, additives and preservatives. In the UK, these foods now represent more than 50 per cent of the diet, which he says is “really quite staggering and shocking”. Similar figures are there for the US and probably to some degree reflect why there is specifically more increased death rates from Covid-19 in these countries. “So, what I would advise the Indian population is to completely cut out these types of food from their diet, make sure that you are cooking from scratch, do not snack,” the doctor said. “Beyond that, the other issue in Indian diet is that we have a very high intake of refined carbohydrate foods, these are also foods that are particularly harmful in excess because they raise glucose and insulin and therefore rooted in many of these chronic conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease – this involves too much consumption of flour and white rice. “These must be swapped with a variety of wholefoods such as vegetables and fruits and for those who are non-vegetarians, it is completely fine to eat red meat as well as full fat dairy products, eggs, fish etc,” he said. In reference to recent data on the higher risk faced by black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities in the UK from coronavirus, the NHS doctor believes that disparity is also cultural or lifestyle related. “South Asians have been found vulnerable because the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is three-four-fold higher in the population. Indians, therefore, I think have to be extra careful with their diet and what they are consuming and they should also not have the illusion of protection just because they are given a normal body mass index (BMI). Extra body fat, particularly around the waist, is much more detrimental to health than using outdated indices such as BMI to define health risk,” he said.

The authenticity of the photos, published on the website of the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper, could not be verified.Also Read: The art of re-emergence: North Korea leader Kim Jong Un appears after long gapThe exchange of gunshots was the latest confrontation between the rival Koreas that technically remain at war.In a lengthy briefing held later on Sunday, an official at South Korea’s JCS said the gunshots did not seem a planned provocation, as the area where it occurred was farmland, but declined to provide a clear conclusion about the incident.“In absence of vision (for the target) and in the fog, would there be an accurate provocation?” the official said. Choi Kang, vice president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, said he believed the timing of the ‘grey area’ provocation shows it could been planned to show that Kim was still in charge of the North Korean military.“Yesterday, Kim was trying to show he is perfectly healthy, and today, Kim is trying to mute all kinds of speculation that he may not have full control over the military,” Choi said. “Rather than going all the way by firing missiles and supervising a missile launch, Kim could be reminding us, ‘yes I’m healthy and I’m still in power’.” Ewha University international affairs professor Leif-Eric Easley in Seoul said the shooting incident could be aimed at boosting morale in the North Korean military“The Kim regime may be looking to raise morale of its frontline troops and to regain any negotiating leverage lost during the rumor-filled weeks of the leader’s absence,” said Easley.“South Korea and the United States should not take lightly such North Korean violations of existing military agreements.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-and-south-korea-exchange-gunfire-across-border-at-guard-post/story-IjNOqJ3ogQf6XMGklEFfFJ.html
03-05-2020||World||The burden of coronavirus: How does Covid-19 mortality rate differ across countries||With over a million Covid-19 patients and more than 60,000 deaths, the United States continues to bear the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak. Europe is the worst-hit continent accounting for more than 1 million cases. An analysis of the Covid-19 mortality rate among European nations suggests that Germany has considerably low numbers Covid-19 fatalities as compared to other countries in the continent like France, Italy, the UK, and Spain. While the UK, Spain, Italy and France have reported more than 25,000 coronavirus fatalities, for Germany the figure rounds up at over 6000 deaths. According to the latest data, Spain has reported 216,582 Covid-19 cases, Italy is at 209,328, followed by the United Kingdom (183,500), France (168,518) and Germany with 164,967 coronavirus cases. Johns Hopkins University suggests Covid-19 countries across the globe have reported very different coronavirus “case fatality ratios”. It is the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases.Also read: What is Remdesivir? How can it help in Covid-19 treatmentThe University states that the number of fatalities can differ across regions owing to the following factors:- Differences in the number of people tested: With more testing, more people with milder cases are identified. This lowers the case-fatality ratio.- Demographics: For example, mortality tends to be higher in older populations.- Characteristics of the healthcare system: For example, mortality may rise as hospitals become overwhelmed and have fewer resources, among other factors. Going by ‘case fatality ratios’, the university data suggest the US to have 5.9% Covid-19 fatality ratio (over 65,000 deaths on more than one million cases) while Germany stands at 4.1%. India is projected to have over 3% Covid-19 mortality ratio with more than 1300 deaths of total 39,980 Covid-19 cases. Johns Hopkins ‘case fatality ratios’ exhibits the ‘burden’ of Covid-19 across various countries. “Countries at the top of the figure have the most deaths proportionally to their Covid-19 cases or population, not necessarily the most deaths overall,” it says.According to the data, the list of countries with highest Covid-19 fatality ratios - most deaths proportionally to their Covid-19 cases or population - has Belgium on top with 15% Covid-19 death rate. The country has around 50,000 coronavirus patients and nearly 8,000 fatalities.

Instead, state media simply showed him surrounded by aides and appearing confident at a gleaming fertiliser factory that is believed by outside experts to be part of a secret nuclear-weapons programme.While much remains a mystery about Kim’s condition, the abrupt re-emergence of the relaxed and smiling leader was clear choreography of key messages from the secretive government: Kim is the supreme leader in full control of a drive to improve the impoverished country’s food security and economy, amid tough international sanctions and the threat of the new coronavirus.CENTRE OF WORLD NEWSThe official Rodong Sinmun newspaper devoted three of its six pages on Saturday to touting Kim’s leadership, crediting him for what it called prosperity and self-reliance.Reuters could not verify the accuracy of official accounts or the authenticity of pictures from the event.The sprawling complex is the result of Kim’s vision to build a modern factory that will support agricultural production and make progress in automating its chemical industry, Pak Pong Ju, a party elder and a loyal aide to Kim, said at the ribbon-cutting where Kim reappeared.North Korea is under sanctions over its nuclear-weapons and missile programmes, leaving the country chronically struggling with food shortages, aggravated by bad weather and mismanagement.Kim’s appearance at the Sunchon fertiliser plant, which official media said occurred on Friday, was an example of “field guidance” - a key part of Kim’s public persona, where he presides over an event at a major industrial or social project, or at other times at military drills involving strategic weapons such as ballistic missiles or tactical warfare.His second public visit this year to the site 50 km (30 miles) north of the capital Pyongyang included a sizeable audience of officials from the army, the ruling Workers’ Party and the local community. Many wore face masks in an apparent precaution against the coronavirus.“Agricultural production is a top priority, which has a direct impact on the lives of the people,” Koh Yu-hwan, the president of the Korea Institute for National Unification, a South Korean government think-tank, said. Koh said Kim’s sudden return was “a strategy to be in the centre of world news without resorting to nuclear or missile tests.”THE ENTOURAGEThe makeup of Kim’s entourage featured familiar faces at such events, including two at the forefront of the North’s years-long drive to improve economic conditions: former premier Pak Pong Ju, who is Kim’s deputy at the State Affairs Commission, and Pak’s successor as premier, Kim Jae Ryong.The pair had accompanied Kim on his last major field guidance, the March groundbreaking of the General Hospital in Pyongyang. To Kim Jong Un’s immediate right on the podium was his sister, Kim Yo Jong, a vice director of the party’s Central Committee and unofficially her brother’s chief of staff. SECRET PROJECTThe phosphate fertiliser factory in Sunchon, under construction since June 2017, has received much attention from North Korea’s leaders, with multiple visits by Kim Jae Ryong and Pak. International observers say the plant is part of the North’s clandestine pursuit of uranium extraction for use in nuclear weapons, as the mineral can be a byproduct of making phosphate fertiliser. There is strong evidence the factory is involved in uranium extraction, said a report this month by the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, based in California, in line with Kim’s policy of pursuing economic and military strength.The North is motivated to use the plant because it is cost-effective and can easily conceal uranium enrichment, which Pyongyang has long sought to hide, the report said. Uranium enrichment offers an alternative to plutonium processing as a fuel for nuclear weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-art-of-re-emergence-north-korea-leader-kim-jong-un-appears-after-long-gap/story-cB1fPxsdDNpR6FqJ7kdeNN.html

According to early clinical data, it can help Covid-19 patients recover faster. The experimental antiviral, which was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for “emergency use authorisation” in the US, is created by pharmaceutical firm Gilead Sciences which is headquartered in California, US, with operations in over 30 countries.The United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) describes Remdesivir as a nucleoside ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase inhibitor.“The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” Anthony Fauci, the top US epidemiologist who oversaw the study, told reporters at the White House as reported by news agency AFP. However, he added that the experimental drug is not a miracle cure.The drug was first developed to treat Ebola and showed early promise in a primate study in 2016.In February, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced working with remdesivir to tackle Covid-19.Also read: US okays remdesivir for emergency Covid-19 useHow does it work?In a trial, evaluating 5-day and 10-day dosing durations of the drug remdesivir in coronavirus patients, it was found that the drug achieved improvement in patients with a severe manifestation of Covid-19 .The effectiveness of the drug was measured in terms of clinical improvement reported in patients ranging from improvement in breathing, increased level of oxygen support to hospital discharge.Nearly 50% of patients in the 5-day treatment showed clinical improvement in 10 days. More than half of patients in two treatment groups of the clinical trial were discharged from the hospital by Day 14. The trial was conducted by Gilead Sciences, Inc.The availabilityRemdesivir has already been given to patients around the world, both in clinical trials and outside. Gilead has been responding to “compassionate use requests” for emergency access. The company is also looking into potentially developing an inhaled formulation, but hasn’t given a timeline.The US FDA has already issued an “emergency use authorisation” which will expand its use further, before it gets a formal approval.The drug is complex to manufacture and is administered via injection, rather than a pill.(With inputs from AFP, Gilead Sciences, US FDA)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-is-remdesivir-how-can-it-help-in-covid-19-treatment/story-yptfinp4SmPlQgNsw6HScM.html
03-05-2020||World||‘Nothing can stop America’: Warren Buffett says US can withstand Covid-19||Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Saturday said the United States’ capacity to withstand crises provides a silver lining as it combats the coronavirus, even as he acknowledged that the global pandemic could significantly damage the economy and his investments.Over more than 4-1/2 hours at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Buffett said his conglomerate has taken many steps responding to the pandemic, including providing cash to struggling operating units, and throwing in the total on a multi-billion-dollar bet on U.S. airlines.Buffett also said he remains keen on making a big acquisition, which he has not done since 2016, but has not provided financial support to companies as he did during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing attractive enough, even after the recent bear market.The 89-year-old opened the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska with 1-3/4 hours of remarks to soothe anxious investors, urging them to stay committed to stocks despite this year’s bear market, even if the pandemic gets a second wind late this year.Illustrating his remarks with dozens of plain black-and-white slides, Buffett called dealing with the pandemic “quite an experiment” that had an “extraordinarily wide” range of possible economic outcomes.But he said Americans have persevered and prospered through such crises as the Civil War in the 1860s, the influenza pandemic a century ago and the Great Depression. American “magic” prevailed before and would do again, he said. “Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it,” Buffett said. “I will bet on America the rest of my life.”The meeting was held virtually for the first time because of the pandemic, without shareholders in attendance, and streamed by Yahoo Finance.Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 57, spent nearly 2-1/2 hours answering shareholder questions posed by a reporter.Abel has day-to-day oversight of Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses, and is considered by many analysts and investors a top candidate to eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive.BERKSHIRE EXITS AIRLINESThe meeting began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $49.75 billion first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealized losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America Corp and Apple Inc during the market meltdown.While quarterly operating profit rose 6%, several larger businesses including the BNSF railroad posted declines, hurt by the negative impact of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.Buffett said operating earnings will, through at least this year, be “considerably less” than they would have been had the pandemic not occurred.Berkshire’s cash stake ended the quarter at a record $137.3 billion, though Buffett said “we’re willing to do something very big,” perhaps a $30 billion to $50 billion transaction.But it won’t be in U.S. airlines, after Buffett confirmed that Berkshire in April sold its “entire positions” in the four largest: American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and United Airlines Holdings Inc.Buffett said he “made a mistake” investing in the sector, which the pandemic has changed “in a very major way” with no fault of the airlines, leaving limited upside for investors.“It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,” he said.The meeting was devoid of the surrounding three-day weekend of dining, shopping and other celebratory events that annually draw tens of thousands of people to Omaha for what Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists.”ABEL SHARES THE STAGEAbel stood in for longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally joins Buffett to answer shareholder questions.Buffett said Munger was in “fine shape” and “good health,” and looked forward to attending Berkshire’s 2021 annual meeting.Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 68, who oversees Berkshire’s insurance businesses and is also considered a possible CEO candidate, was also absent from the meeting. Abel lives closer to Omaha than Munger and Jain.Berkshire has said its board of directors knows who would become CEO if Buffett died or became incapacitated.Buffett’s eldest son Howard would likely become non-executive chairman, and portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler could succeed Buffett as chief investment officer.Abel told investors “I don’t see the culture of Berkshire changing” after Buffett and Munger are no longer there.He also said Berkshire was likely to expand its workforce, which totaled 391,539 people at year end, even though some businesses have furloughed employees and cut salaries since the pandemic began, and could start resorting to layoffs.Berkshire wouldn’t be alone. Nationwide jobless claims have since March 21 totaled about 30.3 million, or 18% of the workforce, a level not seen since the Great Depression.Abel nonetheless said that in five years, “we see our employment numbers being far greater than they are today.”Shareholders also elected Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of longtime Berkshire holding American Express Co, to Berkshire’s board, making him the company’s first African American director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nothing-can-stop-america-warren-buffett-says-us-can-withstand-coronavirus-pandemic/story-KNb4CpS6KqGDy512U9TjMM.html

Economic disruption is posing a major challenge to governments and undermining the ability of so many people to make a living,” the Nobel Peace Prize winner said in a post on his official website on Sunday.The spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism said people must focus on what unites everyone as members of the human race during such a crisis and “need to reach out to each other with compassion”.“As human beings, we are all the same. We experience the same fears, the same hopes, the same uncertainties, yet we are also united by a desire for happiness. Our human capacity to reason and to see things realistically and clearly give us the ability to transform hardship into opportunity,” the 14th Dalai Lama said.“This crisis and its consequences serve as a warning that only by coming together in a coordinated, global response, will we meet the unprecedented magnitude of the challenges we face. I pray we all heed ‘The Call to Unite’,” he said.The Dalai Lama’s message comes as countries around the world grapple with the unprecedented crisis in terms of human loss and economic More than 3.34 million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) globally and 243,674 have died.

03-05-2020||World||Indian-American physician launches study to find if prayers could heal Covid-19 patients||An Indian-American physician in Kansas City has begun a study to find if something called “remote intercessory prayer” might initiate God to heal those infected with the coronavirus.Dhanunjaya Lakkireddy launched the four-month prayer study on Friday, which involves 1,000 coronavirus patients who are in intensive care.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn the study, none of the patients’ prescribed standard care will be changed. They will be divided in two groups of 500 each and prayers will be offered for one of the groups.Also, neither group will be informed about the prayers.The four-month study will investigate “the role of remote intercessory multi-denominational prayer on clinical outcomes in Covid-19 patients,” according to a description provided to the National Institutes of Health. Half of the patients, randomly chosen, will receive a “universal” prayer offered in five denominational forms -- Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism -- while the other patients will constitute the control group.All the patients will receive the standard of care prescribed by their medical providers and Lakkireddy has assembled a steering committee of medical professionals to oversee the study.“We all believe in science, and we also believe in faith,” Lakkireddy said.“If there is a supernatural power, which a lot of us believe, would that power of prayer and divine intervention change the outcomes in a concerted fashion? That was our question,” he said.The investigators will assess how long the patients remain on ventilators, how many suffer from organ failure, how quickly they are released from intensive care and how many die, Lakkireddy said.He describes himself as “born into Hinduism,” but said he also attended a Catholic school and had spent time in synagogues, Buddhist monasteries, and mosques. The physician said he cannot explain how people praying remotely for someone they don’t know (or a group of people,) could actually make a difference in their health outcomes, and acknowledged that some of his medical colleagues have had “a mixed reaction” to his study proposal.Lakkireddy said he has no idea what he will find, “but it’s not like we’re putting anyone at risk. A miracle could happen. There’s always hope, right?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-physician-launches-study-to-find-if-prayers-could-heal-covid-19-patients/story-oYnfAeMjqKhM050LkCGmwJ.html
03-05-2020||World||‘It was 50-50’: UK PM Boris Johnson reveals doctors had contingency plan if he died of Covid-19||Doctors at a London hospital had made arrangements to announce the death of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, he revealed on Sunday, describing his near-death experience after contracting coronavirus and emerging after a stint in the ICU to the relief of many.Johnson, 55, was moved to the St Thomas’ Hospital on April 5 when his condition worsened, and emerged on April 12, grateful to the medical staff for saving his life when, as he said, “things could have gone either way”.Speaking to The Sun on Sunday, an emotional Johnson recalled his brush with death, when he was administered ‘litres and litres’ of oxygen but ICU monitors showed little progress, forcing doctors to make plans to announce his passing away.He recalled: “It was a tough old moment, I won’t deny it. They had a strategy to deal with a ‘death of Stalin’-type scenario. I was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place. The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong”.“It was hard to believe that in just a few days my health had deteriorated to this extent. I remember feeling frustrated. I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t getting better. But the bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. That was when it got a bit . . . they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally.”Johnson went through mixed emotions within a month: recuperating in the country residence in Buckinghamshire and later witnessed his partner, Carrie Symonds, delivering his son, whose middle name is Nicholas, named after doctors Nicholas Price and Nicholas Hart, who saved his life in ICU.Thanking the medical staff for bringing him back from a precarious condition, he said: “It was thanks to some wonderful, wonderful nursing that I made it…I can’t explain how it happened. I don’t know . . . it was just wonderful to see the . . . ”The tabloid’s report said his voice faltered and eyes reddened during the interview in Downing Street, as he added: “I get emotional about it . . . but it was an extraordinary thing,” admitting that he was initially reluctant to go to the hospital.He said: “I’ve broken my nose, I’ve broken my finger, I’ve broken my wrist, I’ve broken my rib. I’ve broken just about everything. I’ve broken all sorts of things, several times in some cases. But I’ve never had anything as serious as this”.“All I remember feeling was just frustration. I couldn’t see why I wasn’t getting better. I was just incredibly frustrated because the bloody indicators kept going in the wrong direction and I thought, ‘There’s no medicine for this thing and there’s no cure’. That was the stage when I was thinking, ‘How am I going to get out of this?’”He insisted: “It would be wrong to say that at any stage I thought, ‘Oh my goodness, this is it’. Some terrible buoyancy within me kept convincing me that everything would almost certainly be all right in the end. But I was just frustrated. I remember seeing a lot of other victims, both going in and going out of intensive care”.According to the interviewer, David Wooding, Johnson is a changed man after the experience: “Over the years, I’ve met or interviewed Boris Johnson many times — but this meeting was like no other. Not only were we forced to sit far apart for social distancing, but it’s clear his brush with death has left him a changed man.”As of Saturday, the UK’s death toll was 28,131 and had registered 182,260 coronavirus cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-was-50-50-uk-pm-boris-johnson-reveals-doctors-had-a-plan-if-he-died-of-covid-19/story-m3P3IPx9vxvn64Zmi3kMyJ.html

If Kim had been incapacitated or dead, it would have increased uncertainty over the process.Trump had downplayed reports of Kim’s poor health and possible demise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-glad-kim-jong-un-is-back-and-well/story-yij9UHVhCNR12z9r3WLSeL.html

His initial estimate based on projections by his coronavirus task force was around 200,000 deaths.Over the last 24 hours, the country reported 1,947 new fatalities and 34,037 new infections.The American president, who once dismissed the Covid-19 outbreak as something that will “disappear” like a “miracle”, has in recent weeks used projections to take credit for taking action and preventing more deaths.“Through our aggressive response and the remarkable commitment and bravery of the American people, we have saved thousands and thousands of lives,” Trump told reporters on Friday before heading out to Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland.He said, “People were thinking in terms of 1.5 million lives lost to 2.2 (million) without the mitigation. Hopefully, we’re going to come in below that... 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number nevertheless.”To apparently keep a tight control on its narrative about the handling of the outbreak, the White House has blocked Anthony Fauci, a top government epidemiologist and member of the US coronavirus task force, from testifying before a congressional committee next week. The Trump administration argued that making key officials who fight the outbreak appear at hearings will be “counterproductive”.States such as California and Michigan are being very careful with their curbs and have tightened restrictions. Beaches and some public parks in California have been closed indefinitely, while Michigan has extended the lockdown to May 15.In New York City, a nursing home on Friday reported the deaths of 98 inmates from Covid-19. “It’s absolutely horrifying,” mayor Bill de Blasio said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fatalities-may-hit-100k-donald-trump/story-AJNSQh0Hj2D7o2W39GofTJ.html
03-05-2020||World||US okays remdesivir for emergency Covid-19 use||The US drug regulator has allowed emergency use of experimental antiviral drug remdesivir for Covid-19 treatment based on early clinical data that showed it helps coronavirus patients recover faster. The drug is made by Gilead Sciences and is the first to be approved globally as a treatment for the viral pandemic that has killed over 240,000 people worldwide.The emergency authorisation allows products to be used for treatment without full data on their safety and efficacy, which has to be still submitted as trials continue. “This was lightning speed in terms of getting something approved. From clinical trial to getting it authorised, it was 90 days,” said US Food and drug Administration (FDA) commissioner Stephen Hahn.Remdesivir, when administered by an intravenous infusion, helped patients recover in 11 days on average , compared to 15 days taken by those on placebo, according to a study sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.US President Donald Trump, who announced the authorisation at the White House on Friday accompanied by top officials of his coronavirus task force and Gilead CEO Dan O’Day, called the drug the “hot thing” and “an important treatment for hospitalised coronavirus patients” and a “promising situation”.The emergency use will be limited to hospitalised Covid-19 patients with low blood-oxygen levels or those who need breathing support, the FDA said.“It is reasonable to believe that remdesivir may be effective in treating Covid-19, and that, when used under the conditions described in this authorisation, the known and potential benefits of remdesivir when used to treat Covid-19 outweigh the known and potential risks of such products,” the US regulator said. “Remdesivir... will be used only to treat adults and children with suspected or laboratory confirmed Covid-19 and severe disease defined as SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air, requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).”Hospitalised patients in need of oxygen support account for about 14% of Covid-19 patients, according to early studies of the outbreak. Patients on mechanical ventilator or ECMO should be given the drug for 10 days, while those who are less sick should get it for five days, Gilead said.“The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” said Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force.Former Indian Council of Medical Research director-general Dr Nirmal K Ganguly said Gilead plans to expand remdesivir trials to many countries, excluding India. “Since the supply (of remdesivir) is limited, according to Gilead, India must consider ways to make this drug available to its population,” said Ganguly.Public Health Foundation of India president Dr K Srinath Reddy said one trial compared five days’ regimen with 10 days’ regimen and noted equal clinical recovery time. “There was no control group and effect on deaths was not studied. Another trial was randomised, had a control group of standard care, and observed a benefit in the reduction of recovery time from severe illness. The impact on death was, however, not statistically significant and hence unproven.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-okays-remdesivir-for-emergency-covid-19-use/story-CqBC5S1Fb1B49ShiY13DLM.html
