The tweet by Brit Hume read, “This might explain why Trump doesn’t like to wear a mask in public. Biden today.”Asked if he meant to criticise the former vice-president for wearing a mask, Trump, said Tuesday, “No, Biden can wear a mask, but he was standing outside with his wife -- perfect conditions, perfect weather. They’re inside, and they don’t wear masks.” This might help explain why Trump doesn’t like to wear a mask in public. Biden today. pic.twitter.com/9l1gw1ljBEPublic health officials have, in fact, recommended masks be worn whenever in social situations where social distancing is difficult, indoors or outdoors.Biden, whose picture on the post was taken during his visit to an event to commemorate Memorial Day, was right for wearing a mask in that situation. “He’s a fool, an absolute fool to talk that way,” Biden said in a CNN interview about the president. “Presidents are supposed to lead, not engage in folly and be falsely masculine.”Even at the time Trump announced recommendatory use of masks, as required by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention early April, the president had said he won’t be wearing one, suggesting he had to deal with other heads of states and governments.And the president has steadfastly refused to wear one since. The one time he did, during a tour of an automobile manufacturing plant last week that had switched to making ventilators, he removed it before facing reporters.Masks have become a tool in a culture war in which some conservatives and right-wing activists have turned them into a sign of weakness. There have been instances in which people wearing masks have been shouted at by others at grocery stores and other public places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-biden-take-on-each-other-over-issue-of-wearing-face-masks/story-YVVhpNjIXsLEznVOTAyXyM.html
27-05-2020||World||PM Boris grilled on adviser row but won’t budge||Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced forensic questions on the conduct of his controversial chief adviser Dominic Cummings from members of the Liaison Committee of the House of Commons on Wednesday, but refused to budge on supporting him in the face of demands to sack him.Johnson and Cummings have been the subject of considerable anger and more across the UK for the latter breaching curbs imposed to deal with coronavirus. Johnson was accused by MPs of putting national health at risk by endangering public trust in official guidance by not dismissing the aide.Johnson again refused to order an inquiry into Cummings’ actions to drive over 260 miles in end-March when his family had virus symptoms, and when official advice was to stay at home. According to him, the inquiry would not be a good use of official time.Repeating that public discourse should now “move on”, Johnson said he understood the anger and indignation of millions of Britons who have flooded email inboxes of MPs on the issue. But he did not think that the row would encourage people to break guidance.He told MPs: “I know there is a great political interest in this and I totally understand the public indignation, but... I have said what I have said about the whole business and it would be much better if we could move on.”Nearly 40 Conservative MPs have openly asked Johnson to dismiss Cummings in order to dispel the growing impression – as borne out in opinion polls – that there is one rule for those in power and another for the people.The government is due to announce its latest assessment of the stage at which the UK is in dealing with the virus on Thursday. As of Wednesday, there have been 37,460 deaths and 267,240 cases in the UK, making it the worst affected in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-boris-grilled-on-adviser-row-but-won-t-budge/story-KGX6a8oKhm9qTV1EvTsaBN.html

The European Union will propose a fiscal package worth more than $800 billion, and Japan is planning new economic stimulus valued in excess of $1 trillion.The euro-area is faring worse than hoped, facing a recession as bad as the European Central Bank’s more pessimistic forecasts. In Britain, pressure mounted on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to fire his chief aide and the government may look at lockdowns on a local level if cases flare.U.S. fatalities approached the 100,000 level, though infections rose at the slowest pace since March and President Donald Trump unveiled plans to increase testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-says-coronavirus-vaccine-in-2020-viable/story-cN8NyEVLOabzzefiGc9u8O.html
27-05-2020||World||Trump threatens to ‘close down’ social media after Twitter fact check||President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened social media companies with new regulation or even shuttering a day after Twitter added fact checks to two of his tweets.The president can’t unilaterally regulate or close the companies, which would require action by Congress or the Federal Communications Commission. But that didn’t stop Trump from angrily issuing a strong warning.Claiming tech giants “silence conservative voices,” Trump tweeted, “We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.”And he repeated his unsubstantiated claim — which sparked his latest showdown with Silicon Valley — that expanding mail-in voting “would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots.”Trump and his campaign angrily lashed out Tuesday after Twitter added a warning phrase to two Trump tweets that called mail-in ballots “fraudulent” and predicted that “mail boxes will be robbed,” among other things. Under the tweets, there is now a link reading “Get the facts about mail-in ballots” that guides users to a Twitter “moments” page with fact checks and news stories about Trump’s unsubstantiated claims.Trump replied on Twitter, accusing the platform of “interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election” and insisting that “as president, I will not allow this to happen.” His 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said Twitter’s “clear political bias” had led the campaign to pull “all our advertising from Twitter months ago.” Twitter has banned all political advertising since last November.Trump did not explain his threat Wednesday, and the call to expand regulation appeared to fly in the face of long-held conservative principles on deregulation.But some Trump allies, who have alleged bias on the part of tech companies, have questioned whether platforms like Twitter and Facebook should continue to enjoy liability protections as “platforms” under federal law — or be treated more like publishers, which could face lawsuits over content.The protections have been credited with allowing the unfettered growth of the internet for more than two decades, but now some Trump allies are advocating that social media companies face more scrutiny.“Big tech gets a huge handout from the federal government,” Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told Fox News. “They get this special immunity, this special immunity from suits and from liability that’s worth billions of dollars to them every year. Why are they getting subsidized by federal taxpayers to censor conservatives, to censor people critical of China.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-threatens-to-close-down-social-media-after-twitter-fact-check/story-SYe4jfTR2kLZO0kE1Io7PI.html
27-05-2020||World||Pandemic creating ‘lockdown generation’ as one in six youths stop work: UN||The Covid-19 pandemic has caused surging unemployment worldwide, but has hit young workers especially hard, forcing more than one in six people aged under 29 to stop working, the UN said Wednesday.In a fresh study, the International Labour Organization warned that the novel coronavirus crisis has disproportionately affected young people, and could impact upon their work opportunities and career options for decades to come.“I don’t think it is giving way to hyperbole to talk about the danger of a lockdown generation,” ILO chief Guy Ryder told a virtual press conference.“As we recover from the pandemic, a lot of young people are simply going to be left behind. Big numbers,” he said, warning that “the danger is... that this initial shock to young people will last a decade or longer.“People will be permanently scarred by the immediate effects of the pandemic.”Even before the crisis, the global youth unemployment rate stood at 13.6 percent in 2019 -- far higher than for any other group -- while some 267 million young people were neither employed nor in education or training (NEET).Overall, the ILO study said it expected the coronavirus crisis to obliterate 10.7 percent of working hours worked globally during the second quarter of 2020 compared to the final three months of 2019 -- the equivalent of 305 million jobs.- ‘Massive increase’ -But while all age groups are suffering, the UN agency pointed to recent data from a range of countries indicating “a massive increase” in youth unemployment since February, with young women particularly hard-hit.In Canada for example, the overall jobless rate rose six percentage points from February to April, but for young men it swelled by 14.3 percentage points (to 27.1 percent) and for young women it ballooned by 20.4 percentage points to 28.4 percent.Similar trends were seen in the United States and a range of other countries, the report said.The ILO said it did not yet have enough data to determine the overall youth unemployment rate since the crisis began.But in a survey of people aged 29 and under, it found that globally, over 17 percent of those who were working when the pandemic hit had been forced to stop.And those who have continued to work have meanwhile seen their working hours cut on average by 23 percent, the study found.The report warned that young people are facing a “triple shock” from the crisis, which is not only destroying their employment but has also disrupted education and training, and has made it far more difficult to try to enter the labour market or move between jobs.It found that around half of students expect their education to be delayed, while 10 percent now believe they will be unable to complete their training at all.And a full 60 percent of young women and 53 percent of young men surveyed viewed their career prospects “with uncertainty or fear”, the report found.The ILO report called for an urgent and large-scale response to the crisis, including employment and training guarantee programmes for young people.“If their talent and energy is sidelined by a lack of opportunity or skills it will damage all our futures and make it much more difficult to re-build a better, post-Covid economy,” Ryder warned.- Step up testing, tracing -As a growing number of countries begin loosening lockdown measures, the ILO also called on them to step up testing and tracing of suspected Covid-19 cases to help get more people back to work. The report found that rigorous testing and tracing was “strongly related to lower labour market disruption”, with the average fall in working hours up to 50 percent lower in countries that had followed this path.This, it said, was linked to the fact that testing and tracing reduced the need for strict confinement measures, and boosted public confidence to visit shops and restaurants.It also stressed that testing and tracing could create new jobs, even if only temporary, which could be targeted at young people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-creating-lockdown-generation-as-one-in-six-youths-stop-work-un/story-qCRoMY5JJESbSy3xD1KXdJ.html
27-05-2020||World||In Wuhan, swab samples are being mixed to carry out quick group tests||Chinese health authorities in Wuhan carried out mixed testing of nose or throat swabs of residents to check for Covid-19 so that millions of samples could be tested in quick time, local media reports said.Between May 15 and 25, Wuhan medics tested more than 6.5 million residents, a state media report said, adding at least 218 among them were found to be asymptomatic.The current nucleic acid tests are being carried out after Wuhan where the coronavirus emerged late last year opened up on April 8 after a 76-day lockdown.Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, was badly affected by the outbreak, accounting for over 50,000 infections and around 3,800 deaths.The mass testing is part of China’s efforts to fortify against a potential “second wave” after a cluster of cases emerged in a residential community earlier this month.To carry out the tests in time, health workers collected and mixed 10 to 20 samples and carried out a single test on them; If the collected sample was positive, each individual was tested again to identify which person was positive.An unnamed medic told the Caixin news website that the authorities believed that the approach works well as long as the testing follows procedure.“Disease control agencies have used this approach before and trial testing is usually conducted in advance to set a minimum concentration level for testing,” the staff member told Caixin.“This is the only way to speed up the process, otherwise Wuhan cannot test as many samples within such a short time,” Peng Zhiyong, director of the intensive care unit of the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, told state media.The largest single-day number tested was on May 22 when 1,470,950 nucleic acid tests were performed.The local health commission said the tests are being carried out free of charge. Priority was given to residential compounds that had previously reported infections, as well as old and densely populated compounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-wuhan-swab-samples-are-being-mixed-to-carry-out-quick-group-tests/story-bqnwz16r3Ltjxyur90omqJ.html
27-05-2020||World||South Korea sees biggest jump in coronavirus cases in seven weeks||South Korea reported its biggest jump in coronavirus infections in seven weeks on Wednesday, driven by a fresh cluster at an e-commerce warehouse on Seoul’s outskirts, as millions more pupils went back to school.The country has been held up as a global model in how to curb the virus and has rushed to contain new infections as life returns to normal.But officials announced 40 new cases Wednesday -- taking its total to 11,265 -- with most new infections from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area.It was the largest increase since 53 infections were announced on April 8.An outbreak at a warehouse of e-commerce firm Coupang in Bucheon, west of Seoul, has seen 36 cases so far, the KCDC added.“It is suspected that the basic regulations were not enforced at the warehouse,” said vice health minister Kim Gang-lip.“If quarantine rules are not implemented at workplaces, it could lead to a dreadful result of a mass infection.”But officials said the possibility of parcel recipients being infected was low.Social distancing rules have been relaxed in South Korea and facilities such as museums and churches have reopened while some professional sports -- including baseball and soccer -- started new seasons earlier this month, albeit behind closed doors.More than two million students returned to classes on Wednesday, as part of the phased reopening of schools.Some high schools were forced to turn back pupils shortly after resuming classes last week over concerns of new virus cases in their neighbourhood.The country endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the disease outside mainland China, and while it never imposed a compulsory lockdown, strict social distancing had been widely observed since March.But it appears to have brought its outbreak under control thanks to an extensive “trace, test and treat” programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-sees-biggest-jump-in-coronavirus-cases-in-seven-weeks/story-UfRoj5uo74cdz3E8VVWSfJ.html
27-05-2020||World||China’s survey team summits Mt Everest to remeasure its height||A Chinese survey team on Wednesday reached Mount Everest through Tibet to remeasure the exact height of the world’s tallest mountain.According to China’s measurement the height of Mount Everest is 8844.43 meters which is four meters less than Nepal’s calculations, the state media reported.On May 1, China, which differs with Nepal over the height of Mount Everest, began a new survey to measure the altitude of the world’s highest peak.The event marked a crucial step in China’s mission to remeasure the height of the world’s highest peak, which scientists believe will enhance human knowledge of nature and help boost scientific development, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.After summiting, team members began erecting a survey marker on the snow-covered peak, which measures less than 20 square meters, the report said.Chinese surveyors have conducted six rounds of scaled measurement and scientific research on Mt Everest and released the height of the peak twice in 1975 and 2005, which was 8,848.13 meters and 8,844.43 meters respectively, the report said.In Tibetan language, Mount Everest is known as Mount Qomolangma.China and Nepal settled their border dispute in 1961 with the boundary line passing through the summit of Mount Everest.More and more international climbers are reportedly using the Tibetan side of Mount Everest as China has improved infrastructure facilities compared to that of Nepal.China which closed Qomolangma National Park in southwest China’‘s Tibet Autonomous Region as a precaution following the coronavirus outbreak reopened it on May 1 coinciding with May Day holidays.Nepal closed all of its Himalayan peaks including Mount Everest in March in view of the coronavirus outbreak. Chinese tech firm Huawei is working with China Mobile to build two 5G stations on Mount Everest.The stations are expected to cover the summit of the mountain. The two installations will be the world’s highest terrestrial 5G base stations, Global Times reported on May 1.“The 6,500-meter-high point will likely be the highest place where Huawei is able to build a 5G station, but whether the signal can extend as high as the summit at 8,848 meters still needs to be tested. We are striving to make that happen,” Zhang Bo, Huawei project manager said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-survey-team-summits-mt-everest-to-remeasure-its-height/story-snh11Jgl5S04q1t50JhaDK.html

27-05-2020||World||Twitter calls out US President Donald Trump, he responds||US President Donald Trump on Wednesday hit back at Twitter for tagging two of his tweets with a fact-checking warning label. He accused the micro-blogging website of “interfering” in the US election and “completely stifling” free speech.“Twitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election. They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post....,” Trump tweeted on Tuesday. .@Twitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election. They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post....“Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!” he said in another tweet.Twitter had on Tuesday for the first time prompted readers to check the facts in tweets sent by Trump, warning that his claims about mail-in ballots were false and had been debunked by fact checkers.The move marked a dramatic shift for the social network, Trump’s primary tool for getting an unfiltered version of his message out to his political base, after years of permissive policies around content on its platform.The company has been tightening those policies in recent years amid criticism that its hands-off approach had allowed abuse, fake accounts and misinformation to thrive.Trump, who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter, claimed in tweets earlier in the day that mail-in ballots would be “substantially fraudulent” and result in a “rigged election.” He also singled out the governor of California over the issue, although the state is not the only one to use mail-in ballots.Hours later, Twitter posted a blue exclamation mark alert underneath those tweets, prompting readers to “get the facts about mail-in ballots” and directing them to a page with information aggregated by Twitter staffers about the claims.Twitter said the application of a fact-checking label to the president’s tweets was an extension of its new “misleading information” policy, introduced earlier this month to combat misinformation about the coronavirus.It said at the time that it would later extend the Covid-19 policy to other types of disputed or misleading information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-calls-out-us-president-donald-trump-he-responds/story-myojgJcB5tiu29nV8gVqLP.html
27-05-2020||World||Remdesivir improves time to recovery in Covid-19 patients: Study||Remdesivir, the antiviral under clinical trials for treatment against novel coronavirus infection, is superior to the standard of care given to COVID-19 patients, according to a new study. The analysis, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, is based on data from the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT), sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in the US. In the randomised, controlled trial, clinicians enrolled adults hospitalised with COVID-19 who showed infection in the lower respiratory tract and suffered from moderate to severe disease. The researchers, including those from the New York University in the US, found that remdesivir was most beneficial for hospitalised patients with severe disease requiring supplemental oxygen. “Preliminary results of this trial suggest that a 10-day course of remdesivir was superior to placebo in the treatment of hospitalised patients with Covid-19,” the scientists wrote in the study. Findings about benefits in other patient subgroups were less conclusive in this analysis, they said. The study began on February 21, 2020 and enrolled 1,063 participants in 10 countries, with patients providing informed consent to participate, the researchers said. They said the patients were randomly assigned to receive local standard care and a 10-day course of the antiviral remdesivir intravenously, or local standard care and a placebo. According to the study, the trial was double-blind, meaning neither investigators nor participants knew who was receiving remdesivir or placebo. The preliminary findings, based on an analysis of 1059 participants, noted that patients who received remdesivir had a shorter time to recovery than those who received placebo. “We are awaiting final visits, data entry, monitoring, and data lock for the last of the 1063 patients enrolled, after which an update of the results will be provided,” the researchers noted in the study. The study defined recovery as being discharged from the hospital or being medically stable enough to be discharged from the hospital. The median time for this, the researchers said, was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compared with 15 days for those who received placebo. According to the study, the clinicians tracked patients’ health status daily using an eight-point ordinal scale ranging from fully recovered to death.When the scientists compared clinical status between the study participants on day 15, they found that the odds of improvement in the ordinal scale were higher in the remdesivir arm than in the placebo arm of the trial. The study also suggested a survival benefit, with a 14-day mortality rate of 7 per cent for the group receiving remdesivir compared to nearly 12 per cent for the placebo group. However, the scientists noted that the difference in mortality was not statistically significant. But they said the findings support remdesivir as the standard therapy for patients hospitalised with Covid-19, and requiring supplemental oxygen therapy. The researchers said the mortality rate of 7 per cent at 14 days in the remdesivir arm indicated the need to evaluate antivirals with other therapeutic agents to continue to improve clinical outcomes for patients with Covid-19. “However, given high mortality despite the use of remdesivir, it is clear that treatment with an antiviral drug alone is not likely to be sufficient,” the scientists noted in the study.

27-05-2020||World||Only half of Americans would get access to Covid-19 vaccine: Poll||Only about half of Americans say they would get a Covid-19 vaccine if the scientists working furiously to create one succeed, according to a new poll.That’s surprisingly low considering the effort going into the global race for a vaccine against the coronavirus that has sparked a pandemic since first emerging from China late last year. But more people might eventually roll up their sleeves: The poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, released Wednesday, found 31% simply weren’t sure if they’d get vaccinated. Another 1 in 5 said they’d refuse.Health experts already worry about the whiplash if vaccine promises like President Donald Trump’s goal of a 300 million-dose stockpile by January fail. Only time and science will tell -- and the new poll shows the public is indeed skeptical.“It’s always better to under-promise and over-deliver,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.“The unexpected looms large and that’s why I think for any of these vaccines, we’re going to need a large safety database to provide the reassurance,” he added.Among Americans who say they wouldn’t get vaccinated, 7 in 10 worry about safety. “I am not an anti-vaxxer,” said Melanie Dries, 56, of Colorado Springs, Colorado. But, “to get a Covid-19 vaccine within a year or two ... causes me to fear that it won’t be widely tested as to side effects.” Dr Francis Collins, who directs the National Institutes of Health, insists safety is the top priority. The NIH is creating a master plan for testing the leading Covid-19 vaccine candidates in tens of thousands of people, to prove if they really work and also if they’re safe.“I would not want people to think that we’re cutting corners because that would be a big mistake. I think this is an effort to try to achieve efficiencies, but not to sacrifice rigor,” Collins told the AP earlier this month.“Definitely the worst thing that could happen is if we rush through a vaccine that turns out to have significant side effects,” Collins added.Among those who want a vaccine, the AP-NORC poll found protecting themselves, their family and the community are the top reasons.“I’m definitely going to get it,” said Brandon Grimes, 35, of Austin, Texas. “As a father who takes care of his family, I think ... it’s important for me to get vaccinated as soon as it’s available to better protect my family.” And about 7 in 10 of those who would get vaccinated say life won’t go back to normal without a vaccine. A site foreman for his family’s construction business, Grimes travels from house to house interacting with different crews, and said some of his coworkers also are looking forward to vaccination to minimize on-the-job risk.The new coronavirus is most dangerous to older adults and people of any age who have chronic health problems such as diabetes or heart disease. The poll found 67% of people 60 and older say they’d get vaccinated, compared with 40% who are younger.And death counts suggest black and Hispanic Americans are more vulnerable to Covid-19, because of unequal access to health care and other factors. Yet the poll found just 25% of African Americans and 37% of Hispanics would get a vaccine compared to 56% of whites.Among people who don’t want a vaccine, about 4 in 10 say they’re concerned about catching Covid-19 from the shot. But most of the leading vaccine candidates don’t contain the coronavirus itself, meaning they can’t cause infection.And 3 in 10 who don’t want a vaccine don’t fear getting seriously ill from the coronavirus.Over 5.5 million people worldwide have been confirmed infected by the virus, and more than 340,000 deaths have been recorded, including nearly 100,000 in the U.S., according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. Experts believe the true toll is significantly higher.And while most people who get Covid-19 have mild cases and recover, doctors still are discovering the coronavirus attacks in far sneakier ways than just causing pneumonia — from blood clots to heart and kidney damage to the latest scare, a life-threatening inflammatory reaction in children.Whatever the final statistics show about how often it kills, health specialists agree the new coronavirus appears deadlier than the typical flu. Yet the survey suggests a vaccine would be no more popular than the yearly flu shot.Worldwide, about a dozen Covid-19 vaccine candidates are in early stages of testing or poised to begin. British researchers are opening one of the biggest studies so far, to test an Oxford University-created shot in 10,000 people.For all the promises of the Trump administration’s “ Operation Warp Speed,” only 20% of Americans expect any vaccine to be available to the public by year’s end, the poll found. Most think sometime next year is more likely.Political divisions seen over how the country reopens the economy are reflected in desire for a vaccine, too. More than half of Democrats call a vaccine necessary for reopening, compared to about a third of Republicans. While 62% of Democrats would get the vaccine, only 43% of Republicans say the same.“There’s still a large amount of uncertainty around taking the vaccine,” said Caitlin Oppenheimer, who leads NORC’s public health research. “There is a lot of opportunity to communicate with Americans about the value and the safety of a vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/half-of-americans-would-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-poll/story-mEPS41IpnJrNYBFNiPT4KI.html
27-05-2020||World||Covid-19: China’s industrial firms profits fall in April but at slower pace||Profits at China’s industrial firms fell at a slower pace in April, helped by improvements in automobiles and electronics, but the economy faces persistent pressure as activity and demand remains weak after the coronavirus outbreak.Profits at China’s industrial firms in April fell 4.3% year-on-year to 478.1 billion yuan ($67 billion), after plunging 34.9% in March, the statistics bureau said on Wednesday. China’s economy has shown patchy signs of recovery as it reopens after several weeks of tough virus containment measures.But fallout from the pandemic, which paralysed business activity and triggered the first quarterly economic contraction on record, is expected to keep earnings under strain for most of this year.For the first four months, industrial firms’ profits fell 27.4% year-on-year to 1.26 trillion yuan, compared with a 36.7% slump in the first three months. Automobiles, special-purpose equipment, electrical machinery and electronics industries notched up significant recoveries in profits in April. Twenty three out of 41 sectors surveyed posted growth last month versus eight in March. However, the overall profit outlook is not optimistic as market demand has still not recovered, industrial goods prices remain low, and pressure from costs are still high, Zhu Hong, an official at statistics bureau, said in a statement.Recent data from factory activity to trade have underscored a weak outlook for China and the global economy.Beijing has stepped up tax and credit relief for virus-ravaged companies since February, but it has refrained from massive economic stimulus for fear of rekindling debt risks.The uncertainty stoked by the pandemic has forced China to drop its growth target for gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020 for the first time since such annual goals were set three decades ago. Earnings at China’s state-owned industrial firms were down 46.0% year-on-year for the first four months, versus a 45.5% decline in the quarter ended March, the statistics bureau data showed. Liabilities at industrial firms rose 6.2% on year at end-April, versus 5.4% growth as of end-March. Private sector profits declined 17.2% in January-April, narrowing from January-March’s 29.5% fall.The industrial profit data covers large firms with annual revenue over 20 million yuan from their main operations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-china-s-industrial-firms-profits-fall-in-april-but-at-slower-pace/story-CbLPRDofKfyZu6UyhyyNxL.html
27-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Most viruses, other germs do not spread easily on flights, says report||Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention has said in its Covid-19 guidelines which do not recommend following social distancing between two passengers inside a plane or keeping the middle seat unoccupied. As a result of coronavirus pandemic, air traffic inside the US has come to a near halt. Air traffic is said to be down to about 90 per cent. For all travellers coming from overseas, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended 14 days quarantine. “Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes,” the CDC has said in its set of Covid-19 guidelines for air travellers. However, it noted that the air travellers were not risk-free specially in the time of the coronavirus pandemic and recommended Americans to avoid travel as far as possible.“Air travel requires spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces,” it said.“Social distancing is difficult on crowded flights, and you may have to sit near others (within six feet), sometimes for hours. This may increase your risk for exposure to the virus that causes Covid-19,” the CDC said.But instead of recommended social distancing inside commercial planes, the CDC has advised a series of preventive and hygienic measures to be taken by the airlines pilot and crew to prevent the spread of coronavirus.The US Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration in its latest safety alerts for operators on May 11 said that air carriers and crews conducting flight operations having a nexus to the US, including both domestic and foreign air carriers, should follow CDC’s occupational health and safety guidance.The CDC issued its guidelines in first guidelines for the airlines and airline crew on March and again in May. The CDC, which has issued an exhaustive social guideline measures in various sections, is silent on keeping the middle seat of a plane unoccupied so as to maintain the six feet distance between two passengers.It calls for the plane crew to report to the CDC a traveller with specific Covid-19 symptoms like fever, persistent cough, difficulty in breathing and appearing unwell.Asking the airlines and cabin crew to review infection control guidelines for cabin crew, the CDC recommends several measures for cabin crew to protect themselves and others, manage a sick traveller, clean contaminated areas, and take actions after a flight. Prominent among them include wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after assisting sick travellers or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60 per cent alcohol) if soap and water are not available.Airlines should consider providing alcohol-based hand sanitizer to cabin and flight crews for their personal use, it said. The CDC guidelines do not recommend following social distancing inside a plane between two passengers or keeping the middle seat unoccupied. But it asks to minimise contact between passengers and cabin crew and the sick person. “If possible, separate the sick person from others (by a distance of 2 meters or 6 feet, ideally) and designate one crew member to serve the sick person. Offer a facemask, if available and if the sick person can tolerate it. If a facemask is not available or cannot be tolerated, ask the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing,” said the CDC guidelines. If no symptomatic passengers were identified during or immediately after the flight, the CDC recommends airlines to follow routine operating procedures for cleaning aircraft, managing solid waste, and wearing PPE. “If symptomatic passengers are identified during or immediately after the flight, routine cleaning procedures should be followed, and enhanced cleaning procedures should also be used,” it said. Clean porous (soft) surfaces (e.g, cloth seats, cloth seat belts) at the seat of the symptomatic passengers and within 6 feet of the symptomatic passengers in all directions, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-most-viruses-other-germs-do-not-spread-easily-on-flights-says-report/story-CXjmE2U6cZXKNYbus4ZnfM.html
27-05-2020||World||More peacekeeping operations, fewer troops in 2019: Report||The number of international peacekeeping missions rose slightly in 2019, but the number of personnel deployed continued to decline, researchers said Wednesday.The number of multilateral peace operations, both by the UN and others, rose by just one to 61, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).But the number of troops, police and civilian staff decreased by 4.8 percent, with all 10 of the world’s largest operations either withdrawing staff or keeping the level stable.The lower number of personnel continues a four-year trend and is a reflection of reductions or closures of several of the UN’s larger peacekeeping operations.“The UN still has the same number of operations, but the newer operations are smaller in size and they’re mostly political missions,” Jair van der Lijn, director of SIPRI’s Peace Operations and Conflict Management Programme, told AFP.In sub-Saharan Africa, personnel decreased by 5.8 percent, though the region still accounts for 71 percent of all staff in peace operations.Some of the bigger operations, such as UNAMID in Darfur and MONUSCO in the Democratic Republic of Congo are moving towards the end of their lifetime. “Although the situations are not completely stable, the situations have definitely improved compared to what they were,” van der Lijn told AFP.Adding to that, there is “less willingness to deploy new large operations” in the UN’s Security Council, he said, pointing to conflict areas such as Syria, Yemen and Libya where potential UN peacekeeping operations could have been up for debate previously.The reduced willingness can be traced to Security Council members, particularly the US, wanting to cut back on costs, along with a sense that peacekeeping operations are not that effective.A false assumption according to van der Lijn, who says that from a quantitative perspective the results of peacekeeping operations are actually often positive, though people often focus on failed examples like those in Rwanda or the former Yugoslavia.With the reduction of personnel in sub-Saharan Africa, the focus of peacekeeping operations is slightly shifting to the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA), the only regions to see a small increase in the number of peacekeeping personnel.Among UN peacekeeping operations, MINUSMA in Mali continues to be relatively lethal while most other UN operations suffer relatively few deaths from hostile attacks.A total of 28 deaths among UN peacekeeping staff were attributed to malicious acts in 2019, one more than the year before.Of those acts, 23 targeted uniformed personnel, all but one of whom were deployed with MINUSMA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-peacekeeping-operations-fewer-troops-in-2019-report/story-iXVvUdlONxywzMnqxierhM.html
27-05-2020||World||In a first, Twitter adds fact-check warnings to Trump tweets||For the first time, Twitter has flagged some of President Donald Trump’s tweets with a fact-check warning.On Tuesday, Twitter added a warning phrase to two Trump tweets that called mail-in ballots “fraudulent” and predicted that “mail boxes will be robbed,” among other things. ....Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!Under the tweets, there is now a link reading “Get the facts about mail-in ballots” that guides users to a Twitter “moments” page with fact checks and news stories about Trump’s unsubstantiated claims.The move comes after years in which Twitter has declined to apply its community guidelines and other rules of the road to the 45th US president. It’s too soon to tell whether this action represents a turning point for Twitter in its treatment of Trump. But the warning labels suggest that the president has finally crossed a line that the company was not willing to move for him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-first-twitter-adds-fact-check-warnings-to-trump-tweets/story-q2RVx0BBqdWzTeTqbkOZUI.html
27-05-2020||World||1st wave far from over, warns WHO||As South America and South Asia struggle with surging coronavirus cases, a top global health expert is warning that the world is still in the very middle of the outbreak, dampening hopes for a speedy global economic rebound and renewed international travel.“Right now, we’re not in the second wave. We’re right in the middle of the first wave globally,” said Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) executive director. “We’re still very much in a phase where the disease is actually on the way up,” Ryan said, pointing to South America and South Asia.In South America and South Asia, the virus has taken hold in some of the poorest, most densely populated areas.In Brazil, the WHO warned that before reopening the economy, authorities must have enough testing in place to control the spread of the virus. Brazil has 375,000 coronavirus infections and has counted over 23,000 deaths, but many fear Brazil’s true toll is much higher.In Europe, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the postponed military parade marking the 75th anniversary of the allied victory in the World War II will take place on June 24. Putin also said the country has passed the peak of the outbreak. Russia reported a record one-day spike on Tuesday of 174 deaths.Wall street stocks surge as Nyse opensWall Street stocks surged early on Tuesday on optimism about coronavirus vaccines as the New York Stock Exchange resumed physical floor trading for the first time since late March.About 30 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2.4% at 25,038.94. The broad-based S&P 500 gained 1.7% to 3,007.76, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 1.2% to 9,434.99.The gains came after New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, wearing a mask, rang the opening bell to signal the start of the day for traders, also clad in masks and separated by plexiglas.The NYSE, which closed on March 23 as coronavirus cases were soaring in New York, is ramping up slowly with only a fraction of the normal trading staff. Traders are required to wear masks and have their temperatures taken and must respect social distancing rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1st-wave-far-from-over-warns-who/story-UPDHcd64tQ8dCAO93X1k1I.html
