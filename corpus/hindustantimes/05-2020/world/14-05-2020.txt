Students who hadn’t seen each other since in-person classes ended abruptly in March amid the coronavirus outbreak commiserated over all they’ve missed out on, including the prom and a senior class trip.Some also wondered about what they may have lost academically.“Honestly, remote learning, I don’t think was my favorite thing,” said 18-year-old Isabella Branson. “It’s kind of hard to stay motivated when you don’t have anything to look forward to and you don’t see your friends.”The small district in rural Georgia is among many around the U.S. that have pulled the plug on distance learning, all citing familiar reasons. It’s too stressful, the lack of devices and internet access is too much to overcome, and what students get from it just isn’t worth the struggle.In Georgia, where the school year is ending early for one of every 10 students, many district leaders say the final weeks of the school year would have been dedicated anyway to preparing for and taking standardized tests that are now canceled. The governor and state schools superintendent who have moved to dismantle parts of Georgia’s high-stakes testing system have said they are not opposed to fewer instructional days.“We didn’t cut any class time out,” Chattahoochee County High School Principal Josh Kemp said. “There was no reason to pile more on our parents and students.”But Kemp and others also acknowledge that there was material that wasn’t covered and that teachers will have to find a way to fold it in next year for returning students.“They weren’t able to get all the standards,” said Tammy Bailey, the science department chair at the high school. “I think there will be a gap.”Classes had been scheduled to run through May 21 but remote instruction instead came to an end May 8 in the Chattahoochee County school district. A majority of the high school’s 450 students live on the U.S. Army’s sprawling Fort Benning, while a minority live around the small town of Cusseta. Only 59% of households in the district have access to broadband internet at home.Other districts around the country that are ending the school year early including Omaha and some nearby suburban districts in Nebraska, Washington, D.C., and some in New Hampshire. Officials say they want to relieve stress on families, ease problems for students without internet access, and focus on preparing for a fresh start in the fall.The last three weeks of school is “probably not prime instructional time,” said Andrew McEachin, an education policy researcher at RAND Corp. But he said that kids in struggling households may suffer most from being cut off from the normalcy of a school routine.“I think the biggest thing about cutting a school year short is not what it does on average, but what it does on equity,” McEachin said. “Even if school isn’t working as well as we want it to be, that may be the best access low income students have to learning.”Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, said on April 16 that he trusted schools to set their calendars and the following day, state Superintendent Richard Woods wrote that schools’ focus during the pandemic should “not be on test scores” but on making sure children are “healthy, safe and nurtured.”But Michael O’Sullivan, executive director of GeorgiaCAN, a group that supports Georgia’s testing system, says this spring has been a preview of a “zero-accountability world.”“It’s the easy way out of a very difficult situation, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be good for kids,” O’Sullivan said.Some schools in Georgia are making plans to combat academic losses from the year, such as beefed-up summer sessions. The Scintilla Charter Academy in Valdosta is aiming to start the next school year on July 23, to make up the time it lost when it ended on April 30.Scintilla Dean of School Mandy Avera said her families were “stressed and overwhelmed” by online learning. The school covers kindergarten through sixth grade, and Avera is among educators who question whether younger children can successfully acquire critical skills like learning to read without a face-to-face interaction with a teacher.“It just created a situation where we just can’t be as interactive as we like to be at Scintilla,” Avera said. “Kindergartners don’t understand why they’re at home. They don’t understand why they can’t go back to school and see their friends and see their teachers.”Back in Cusseta, some seniors were stressing about being able to bring only four guests to a socially-distant graduation ceremony, while others were disregarding imposed distance to hug and gossip. But Chattahoochee County Superintendent Kristi Brooks was already trying to think about the next school year, despite uncertainty on whether in-person classes will resume.“They’re going to have missed 60 days of instruction,” Brooks said “When we come back for the fall, we’re going to have to pick up in some basic areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-us-schools-are-pulling-the-plug-on-distance-learning/story-WT4hG6HOk1jTLhHibWVkNP.html
14-05-2020||World||Benjamin Netanyahu delays swearing-in of unity government until Sunday over infighting||The swearing-in of a new Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was postponed at the last moment on Thursday by three days in the wake of growing discontent within his Likud party over distribution of ministerial portfolios.A joint statement by Netanyahu and his coalition partner, Benny Gantz of the Blue and White party, said that the two sides have agreed to postpone the swearing-in to Sunday.Gantz initially insisted that the swearing-in will go ahead as planned earlier Thursday evening, but later relented to Netanyahu’s request under the condition that he would withdraw his resignation as the Speaker of the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).Knesset’s spokesperson confirmed the withdrawal request by Gantz.Senior Likud leader and Regional Cooperation Minister Tzachi Hanegbi and Deputy Defence Minister Avi Dichter announced that they would boycott the vote of confidence. “I guess I am not needed in the Knesset, so Shabbat Shalom”, Hanegbi wrote in social media.Miri Regev and Gila Gamliel, who have been offered ministries (transportation and higher education, respectively), are both reportedly unhappy too.The elevation of the relatively junior Likud lawmaker (and current acting Justice Minister) Amir Ohana to minister of public security is said to have infuriated several senior leaders in the Likud party.Despite being the largest government in Israel’s history, Netanyahu’s proposed jumbo cabinet of 36 ministers and 16 deputy ministers has failed to satisfy people within his own ruling Likud party and also his natural coalition partners who stood by him during the last 18 months of political uncertainty.The swearing-in of a new government will bring an end to the longest political deadlock in the country’s history which saw a caretaker government in charge for over 500 days and three back-to-back general elections with no clear verdict.Netanyahu, 70, formally made the announcement that he had succeeded in forming a government on Wednesday in letters sent to President Reuven Rivlin and Blue and White party Chairman Gantz, who is temporarily serving as the Knesset’s (Israeli Parliament) speaker.The new government, which according to the coalition agreement, will see Gantz replace Netanyahu as Prime Minister after 18 months, was scheduled to be sworn in on Thursday evening.Gantz will serve as Defense Minister until he is scheduled to take over as the Prime Minister on November 14, 2021. He will till then have the title of ‘Alternate Prime Minister’, something that Netanyahu will take over from him after exchanging the baton.Prominent ministerial appointments likely are Gabi Ashkenazi (Blue and White party) as foreign minister, Israel Katz (Likud) as finance minister, Avi Nissenkorn (Blue and White party) as Justice minister and Likud Yuli Edelstein (Likud) as health minister.During his tenure as justice minister, Ohana repeatedly attacked the judiciary and those leading it as they pushed forward with criminal investigations, and eventually indictments, against Netanyahu. The Israeli Prime Minister has denied any wrongdoing. His trial is set to start later this month.Ohana’s possible appointment as public security minister had sparked speculation among top police officials that he may seek an outside candidate to lead the force, curtail its Lahav 433 investigation unit, and oppose possible new probes into Netanyahu.The beleaguered Israeli Prime Minister, who surpassed Israel’s first Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion’s record of the longest-serving Premier in the country’s history last year in July, managed to hold on to his right-wing bloc amid three inconclusive polls to force his main rival Gantz to finally succumb to the demand of a broad national unity government.Gantz campaigned on replacing Netanyahu due to the Prime Minister’s indictment on graft charges, but dropped his opposition to sitting in a government with him after the latest elections again ended with no clear winner, citing the coronavirus pandemic and a desire to avoid a fourth round of voting. The move led to the breakup of the Blue and White alliance, with Gantz being elected as Knesset speaker with the backing of Netanyahu’s right-wing religious bloc as they negotiated the terms of the new government. The Likud and Blue and White on Wednesday evening released the policy principles of the new government, as instructed by Israel’s Supreme Court.The document said that the government will initially form an emergency cabinet to deal with the coronavirus pandemic and formulate a plan to bring Israel out of the accompanying economic crisis while rolling out a “socioeconomic safety net” and special programmes for citizens who are struggling financially.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/benjamin-netanyahu-delays-swearing-in-of-unity-government-until-sunday-over-infighting/story-6p4gGOdfjxIxGEeI1Uh7UL.html
14-05-2020||World||US accuses China of trying to hack and steal Covid-19 research||The United States has accused China of unleashing its hackers on American research organizations and pharmaceutical companies working on Covid-19 treatments and vaccines. “These actors have been observed attempting to identify and illicitly obtain valuable intellectual property (IP) and public health data related to vaccines, treatments, and testing from networks and personnel affiliated with COVID-19-related research,” the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a rare joint alert issued Wednesday.“China’s efforts to target these sectors pose a significant threat to our nation’s response to COVID-19,” it added, identifying healthcare, pharmaceutical and research sectors as at risk. The alert also did not identify targeted organizations or describe how the hacking was discovered.These accusation will further escalate tensions between the two countries on over the Covid-19 pandemic. The US has accused China of not alerting the world early enough about the epidemic, which started in Wuhan last December, and not being transparent about its start and the exact magnitude infections and fatalities.News reports suggested some officials in the Trump administration were inclined to view this attempt as a threat to national security as they may have even hindered the ongoing research. No evidence was cited, once again.CISA had issued a joint alert along with the United Kingdom’s National Security Agency in April warning about advanced persistent threat (APT) groups of targeting organizations engaged in local and international response to Covid-19.They had not identified China or any other entity, but said healthcare bodies, pharmaceutical companies, academia, medical research organizations, and local governments.“APT actors frequently target organizations in order to collect bulk personal information, intellectual property, and intelligence that aligns with national priorities,” it added added.The United States has long accused Chinese hackers of targeting companies, research institutions and universities and the theft of intellectual property has been a persistent source of tension between the two countries.US officials have also accused Iran of carrying out similar cyberattacks though the alert did not name it The Wall Street Journal said Iranian hackers have targeted Gilead Science, the maker of remdesivir, which was recently granted emergency-use authorization by the US drug regulator and which has generated excitement around world. hammered by a virus that has continued to defy cure or prevention.More than 90 separate efforts are under was in the United States to find a vaccine. The Trump administration has launched an ambitious Manhattan Project-style effort called “Operation Warp Speed” to expedite the hunt for the vaccine in a private-public partnership. It is reported to have narrowed down the search from an estimated 93 to 14, with plans to further pare it down to seven, and then to 3 or four for final clinical trials in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-accuses-china-of-trying-to-hack-and-steal-covid-19-research/story-72rrovMziDbRfw4FPb8aFJ.html
14-05-2020||World||Donald Trump attacks his top Covid-19 expert Anthony Fauci, squabbles with others||Three million more Americans filed for unemployment benefits, according to new data released Thursday as in his eagerness to arrest and reverse the economic downturn President Donald Trump has publicly squabbled with his top medical official’s assessment of the battle against the Covid-19 epidemic.The number of people left jobless by the eight-week long lockdown forced by the outbreak has now risen to 36.5 million.President Trump has been eager to end the lockdown to arrest the economic downturn and has sought to project a more optimistic view of the outbreak than experts and officials of his own task force, who have said the country is not out of the woods yet. He lashed out Anthony Fauci, the most vocal of these experts, accusing him of trying to “play all sides of the equation”.Trump’s ire was directed this time at Fauci’s testimony before at a us senate hearing Tuesday in which he, and other top public health officials, had offered a far less optimistic assessment of the state of the epidemic in the United States than the one repeatedly offered by the president in his eagerness to reopen the economy and lift restrictions on public life.Trump also attacked Rick Bright, a public health official who was sidelined for questioning he administration’s response and the president’s personal backing for the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine, Thursday ahead of a congressional hearing. Bright said early signs of the epidemic were missed and without proper planning and implementation of steps laid down by experts, “2020 will be darkest winter in modern history”In the past 24 hours, 1,763 people died of Covid-19 taking the US toll to 84,144 and the number of reported infections went up to 1.39 million with 21,030 new cases.“He wants to play all sides of the equation,” Trump told reporters when asked about Fauci’s testimony in which he had urged caution in reopening the economy, as he has consistently.Asked to explain what he meant, Trump said, “I was surprised -- I was surprised by his answer, actually, because, you know, it’s just -- to me, it’s not an acceptable answer, especially when it comes to schools.”Fauci had urged caution in reopening the economy and country and warned against rushing it into it, which he had said, could lead to “little spikes that might turn into outbreaks.” Both he and Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), had also argued the United States is not out of the woods yet.President Trump has been eager to reopen the economy and has been at odds with Fauci and other members of the task force he set up to spearhead his administration’s response to the epidemic, who have consistently urged caution.Until now, however, the president had refrained from publicly acknowledging these differences and expressed complete respect for faith in his experts. Bu he is said to have been privately fuming with Fauci, who does not shrink from publicly disagreeing with the president.But as the president kept his peace, until now, allies and supporters went after Fauci, accusing him of trying to impose his will on the president and the administration. Fox News anchors have led the charge questioning his credentials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-attacks-his-top-covid-19-expert-anthony-fauci-squabbles-with-others/story-f8dKD6w76MzZvajnx2rcgJ.html
14-05-2020||World||Barack Obama emerges as central figure in 2020 presidential race||Nearly eight years after he was last on the ballot, Barack Obama is emerging as a central figure in the 2020 presidential election.Democrats are eagerly embracing Obama as a political wingman for Joe Biden, who spent two terms by his side as vice president. Obama remains the party’s most popular figure, particularly with black voters and younger Democrats, and Biden’s presidential campaign is planning for him to have a highly visible role in the months to come.For President Donald Trump, that means an opportunity to focus the spotlight on one of his favorite political foils. In recent days, Trump and his allies have aggressively pushed conspiracy theories about Obama designed to fire up the president’s conservative base, taint Biden by association and distract from the glut of grim health and economic news from the coronavirus pandemic.“Partisans on both sides want to make this about Obama,” said Ned Price, who served as spokesperson for Obama’s White House National Security Council.The renewed political focus on Obama sets the stage for an election about the nation’s future that will also be about its past. As Biden looks to Obama for personal validation, he’s also running to restore some of the former president’s legacy, which has been systematically dismantled by Trump. The current president is running in part to finish that job.Yet Trump’s anti-Obama push also frequently takes on a darker, more conspiratorial tone that goes far beyond differences in health care policy and America’s role in the world. His current focus is on the actions Obama, Biden and their national security advisers took in the closing days of their administration, as they viewed intelligence reports about Michael Flynn. Flynn had a short-lived stint as Trump’s national security adviser before being fired for lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his interactions with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S.Trump’s own administration acknowledged on Wednesday that Obama advisers followed proper procedures in privately “unmasking” Flynn’s name, which was redacted in the intelligence reports for privacy reasons. Flynn ultimately pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, though Trump’s Justice Department moved last week to drop the case against him.Despite there being no evidence of wrongdoing by Obama, Biden or other administration officials, Trump is eagerly pushing the notion of an unspecified crime against the former president, branding it “Obamagate.” He’s being backed up by Republican allies, including Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley who took to the Senate floor this week to ask of the Flynn matter: “What did Obama and Biden know, and when did they know it?”Trump’s zeal has sparked fears among some former Obama and Biden advisers about how far he may be willing to go in using the levers of government to push his case against them in an election year. The Justice Department is conducting an investigation into the origins of the Russia probe that ensnared Flynn and other Trump associates.Trump’s renewed focus on Obama comes as Republicans grow increasingly anxious that the rising coronavirus death toll and cratering economy will damage the president’s reelection prospects in November. More than 84,000 Americans have died from the virus, and more than 30 million have claimed unemployment.Biden’s campaign drew a direct connection between the president’s attacks on Obama and the twin crises battering his administration.“It’s no surprise that the president is erratically lashing out at President Obama, desperate to distract from his own failures as commander in chief that have cost thousands of Americans their lives during this crisis,” said TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman.Trump’s emphasis on Obama also comes as the former president begins to emerge from a three-year period of political restraint as he prepares to embrace his role as leading surrogate for Biden. Last week, Obama told a large gathering of alumni from his administration that DOJ’s decision to drop the Flynn case put the “rule of law at risk.” He also criticized the Trump White House’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.Biden’s campaign has been eager to get Obama involved in the election, though his exact role is still forming, particularly given that the pandemic has upended the campaign’s plans for rallies and other in-person events in battleground states. The former president is also expected to campaign for Democratic House and Senate candidates across the country.Though Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterms, he has mostly tried to avoid overt politics since leaving the White House. He’s spoken out publicly against Trump on rare occasions, frustrating many Democrats who have wanted him to be more aggressive in calling out his successor.But the 2020 election has always loomed as the moment when Obama would step off the sidelines, and he’s told advisers he’s eager to do so. Despite his strident public neutrality during the Democratic primary, he spoke to Biden regularly and has continued to do so as the campaign moves into the general election, according to aides.Biden’s campaign sees Obama as a clear asset as they seek to not only energize Democrats,but to also appeal to independents and more moderate Republicans who may be wary of four more years of Trump in the White House.A recent Monmouth University poll found 57% of Americans say they have a favorable opinion of Obama. That includes 92% of Democrats and 19% of Republicans.Obama’s favorable ratings are higher than either of the men who will be on the ballot in November. The same poll showed 41% of Americans had a favorable opinion of Biden, and 40% viewed Trump in a favorable light.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-emerges-as-central-figure-in-2020-presidential-race/story-xlNKHwFTNsbLdSmd3XC6jI.html
14-05-2020||World||WTO to make announcement about chief amid reports he will resign||The World Trade Organization will make an announcement Thursday about its Director-General Roberto Azevedo, a spokesman said, following reports he is planning to step down before his term expires next year.“The WTO will have an announcement on this matter following the heads of delegation meeting” at 1400 GMT, spokesman Keith Rockwell said in an email statement sent to AFP, adding that no further comment would be made before then.His comment came after Bloomberg reported that Azevedo had told governments he planned to step down before the end of his mandate, with the news agency suggesting he would leave on September 1.The 62-year-old Brazilian career diplomat first took the reins of the global trade body in 2013 and his second term is due to end in 2021.Several diplomats confirmed to AFP that they had been hastily called to take part in a meeting Thursday on “pressing administrative matters”.Azevedo’s possible early departure would come at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed the global economy and international trade into turmoil, suffering slowdowns not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Global trade, already hit by trade tensions and uncertainties around Brexit, is expected to register “double-digit declines in trade volumes” in nearly all regions this year, the WTO said last month.The organisation was meanwhile already in crisis before the pandemic hit, amid raging trade wars and as the United States under President Donald Trump has pushed for dramatic reforms of the Geneva-based body.The WTO was, for instance, forced to put its dispute settlement appeal system on ice last December after Washington blocked the appointment of new judges, preventing it from reaching a three-judge quorum.Azevedo, who before his appointment as WTO chief spent five years as his country’s ambassador to the organisation, has enjoyed a reputation as a consensus-builder.During his first term he dedicated much energy to trying to unblock long-deadlocked trade agreements.In 2014 managed to help secure the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), in which nations agreed to simplify and standardise customs procedures at borders to make it easier for goods to flow around the world.But countries have since then failed to reach any further multilateral agreements, including on fisheries subsidies, and since 2017, the WTO has struggled to deal with a US administration openly hostile to its multilateral approach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wto-to-make-announcement-about-chief-amid-reports-he-will-resign/story-qvhN6bIX1Eisswei7HgMzJ.html
14-05-2020||World||36 million have sought US unemployment aid since coronavirus hit||Nearly 3 million laid-off workers applied for U.S. unemployment benefits last week as the viral outbreak led more companies to slash jobs even though most states have begun to let some businesses reopen under certain restrictions.Roughly 36 million people have now filed for jobless aid in the two months since the coronavirus first forced millions of businesses to close their doors and shrink their workforces, the Labor Department said Thursday.Still, the number of first-time applications has now declined for six straight weeks, suggesting that a dwindling number of companies are reducing their payrolls.By historical standards, though, the latest tally shows that the number of weekly jobless claims remains enormous, reflecting an economy that is sinking into a severe downturn. Last week’s pace of new applications for aid is still four times the record high that prevailed before the coronavirus struck hard in March.Jobless workers in some states are still reporting difficulty applying for or receiving benefits. These include free-lance, gig and self-employed workers, who became newly eligible for jobless aid this year.The states that are now easing lockdowns are doing so in varied ways. Ohio has permitted warehouses, most offices, factories, and construction companies to reopen, but restaurants and bars remain closed for indoor sit-down service.A handful of states have gone further, including Georgia, which has opened barber shops, bowling alleys, tattoo parlors and gyms. South Carolina has reopened beach hotels, and Texas has reopened shopping malls.Data from private firms suggest that some previously laid-off workers have started to return to small businesses in those states, though the number of applications for unemployment benefits remains high.The latest jobless claims follow a devastating jobs report last week. The government said the unemployment rate soared to 14.7% in April, the highest rate since the Great Depression, and employers shed a stunning 20.5 million jobs. A decade’s worth of job growth was wiped out in a single month.Even those figures failed to capture the full scale of the damage. The government said many workers in April were counted as employed but absent from work but should have been counted as temporarily unemployed.Millions of other laid-off workers didn’t look for a new job in April, likely discouraged by their prospects in a mostly shuttered economy, and weren’t included, either. If all those people had been counted as unemployed, the jobless rate would have reached nearly 24%.Most economists have forecast that the official unemployment rate could hit 18% or higher in May before potentially declining by summer.The job market’s collapse has occurred with dizzying speed. As recently as February, the unemployment rate was 3.5%, a half-century low. Employers had added jobs for a record 9½ years. Even in March, unemployment was just 4.4%.Now, with few Americans shopping, traveling, eating out or otherwise spending normally, economists are projecting that the gross domestic product — the broadest gauge of economic activity — is shrinking in the April-June quarter at a roughly 40% annual rate. That would be the deepest quarterly contraction on record.Few analysts expect a quick rebound. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned Wednesday that the virus-induced recession could turn into a prolonged downturn that would erode workers’ skills and employment connections while bankrupting many small businesses.Powell urged Congress and the White House to consider additional spending and tax measures to help small businesses and households avoid bankruptcy.Powell spoke a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, proposed a $3 trillion aid package that would direct money to state and local governments, households and health-care workers. Trump administration officials have countered that they want to first see how previous federal aid packages affect the economy. And Republican leaders in Congress have expressed skepticism about approving significant more spending right now.Trump is applauding the moves to reopen states’ economies in hopes of reducing unemployment. So far, there is limited evidence on how that is working.Homebase, a software company that provides time-clock technology to small businesses, has tracked how many employees have clocked in and for how many hours since the pandemic struck. Though Homebase’s data suggests that some people have returned to work in states that have partially reopened, it’s unclear how sustainable that trend can be unless many more customers return. All states remain far below their pre-virus employment levels.In Georgia, which began reopening in late April, the number of people working at small businesses on Tuesday was down 37% compared with the beginning of March, according to Homebase’s data. That is an improvement from mid-April, when the number of employees working had fallen by half.In New York, which remains mostly shut down, employment at small businesses is down 63% as of Tuesday, only slightly better than in mid-April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/36-million-have-sought-us-unemployment-aid-since-coronavirus-hit/story-vwVdCbHV4SvCUWchesR6IK.html
14-05-2020||World||Temperature checks, masks the new normal for air travel, says Dubai airport CEO||Temperature screening and face masks will become common sights at airports to mitigate the spread of the new coronavirus but physical distancing could make flying more expensive, the head of Dubai airport said. Around the world, governments, airports and airlines are considering temporary safety measures to restart air travel, including mandatory temperature checks, wearing face masks and keeping passengers apart.“We are going to have to take whatever measures are necessary to protect the travelling public and our staff,” Chief Executive Paul Griffiths told Reuters.Dubai International, one of the world’s busiest airports, suspended passenger services in late March as the United Arab Emirates took drastic measures to contain the virus. The UAE has since allowed some repatriation flights and eased other restrictions in the Gulf state, though it is not clear when normal flights will restart. Temporary safety measures should be expected as flights resume but Griffiths cautioned physical distancing rules would eventually limit growth as demand rebounds.“We will not be able to operate at anything close to our original design capacity if we had to maintain social distancing,” he said.Dubai airport, the hub of airline Emirates, was handling Airbus A380s with over 600 passengers before the virus forced the airport to halt flights.Physical distancing could also increase airfares if airlines were restricted to selling fewer tickets in order to keep some seats empty, Griffiths said.FIT TO TRAVELBut until there was a vaccine, treatment or reliable, quick method to detect the virus, measures that reduce the risk of contagion would need to be enforced, Griffiths said.It is unclear when global travel will recover from the pandemic which has shattered demand and will partially depend on countries lifting their lockdowns.Regaining public confidence in the safety of air travel is seen by the aviation industry as a significant challenge. Countries that have the spread of the virus under control and agree to reopen their borders to each other are likely to drive air travel demand over the near term, Griffiths said, but it is impossible to say when travel could return to pre-pandemic levels.Passenger traffic at Dubai airport fell by a fifth in the first quarter to 17.8 million as countries closed their borders due to the coronavirus outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/temperature-checks-masks-the-new-normal-for-air-travel-says-dubai-airport-ceo/story-6JoSjUNki5M8yMNjj3M8IM.html
14-05-2020||World||Typhoon hits Philippines as some places see covid pandemic relief||A typhoon that slammed into the Philippines on Thursday forced a risky evacuation for tens of thousands of people during the coronavirus pandemic, while New Zealand and Japan were among countries to relax restrictions as the virus is brought under control in some places.Typhoon Vongfong added the threat of flooding and landslides to the further spread of COVID-19 as people in the eastern Philippines were evacuated into shelters. Officials were seeking to open up more shelter space so people could create more physical distance from themselves, something that was a clear challenge as fierce rains and winds battered the region.As the pandemic restrictions across the globe inflict damage on economies, several governments promised relief. New Zealand’s government said it plans to borrow and spend vast amounts of money as it tries to keep unemployment below 10%.“We face a global economic and health crisis not seen since the Great Depression,” Finance Minister Grant Robertson said.In Italy, one of the worst-hit countries, Premier Giuseppe Conte promised a massive package of tax cuts and other financial aid to help businesses and families.“Your cry of alarm didn’t escape us,” Conte said late Wednesday.His government also promised to legalize the status of foreigners, many of them illegal migrants who are crop-pickers, baby-sitters and caretakers.The world’s public health measures continue to provoke conflict between officials and the public.In Ethiopia, police said they arrested over 1,000 people for refusing to wear face masks in public, while in Greece a spat broke out over a government plan to install cameras in high school classrooms. The idea is to provide live-streaming to allow for reduced classroom attendance when schools reopen next week. But a privacy watchdog and a left-wing opposition party called cameras a serious privacy risk.In many parts of the world, communities and individuals were finding inventive ways to cope with what many view as a “new normal.”Apartment dwellers in Rio de Janeiro were getting some much-needed entertainment from children’s movies projected onto screens set up outside their buildings, similar to a drive-in theater.Cesar Miranda Ribeiro, president of city-owned RioFilme company, said the effort, called “Cinema in the Windows,” is aimed at “trying to take care of the mental health of the people.”Chinese people looking for some stay-at-home retail therapy have tuned into livestream shopping.Others seeking spiritual support and human connections are worshipping remotely via online religious services, including from the Vatican to village churches.“People in general, I think, are looking for more meaning and spirituality in the midst of all this,” said Omar Suleiman, an Islamic leader in Irving, Texas, whose Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research has been uploading YouTube videos. “So I think there’s just a general increase in religiosity and consumption of religious content.”For most leaders, though, the focus was a far more worldly one: how to get back to business and revive economies reeling from record numbers of job losses and chilling uncertainty.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday announced the lifting of an ongoing state of emergency in most parts of the country ahead of schedule.Abe lifted the measure for 39 of the country’s 47 prefectures, effective immediately, while keeping the measure in place for eight others, including Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Hokkaido, where risks still remain high.“Today is the new beginning for our daily lives, a new normal,” Abe said, but also warning of the risk of a resurgence of the disease.In New Zealand, malls, retail stores and restaurants reopened Thursday and many people returned to their workplaces as the nation of 5 million people ended most of its coronavirus lockdown restrictions. But most gatherings will be limited to 10 people and social distancing guidelines will remain in place.The U.S. has the largest coronavirus outbreak in the world by far: 1.39 million infections and over 84,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 4.3 million people and killed some 297,000. Experts say the actual numbers are likely far higher.A top U.S. immunologist who says he lost his government job because he warned the Trump administration to prepare for the coronavirus pandemic said he was ready to tell Congress that America faces its “darkest winter in modern history” unless leaders act decisively to prevent a rebound of the coronavirus.Dr. Rick Bright’s testimony due Thursday follows this week’s warning by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, that rushing to lift store-closing and stay-at-home restrictions could “turn back the clock,” seeding more suffering and death and complicating efforts to get the economy rolling again.But the pressure is on to staunch job losses after the U.S. unemployment rate soared to 14.7% in April, the highest since the Great Depression.The fallout from the pandemic includes heightened political tensions between nations.In China, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, criticized the United States, saying authorities there have failed to effectively fight the global coronavirus pandemic and “abused American people’s trust.”Zhao appeared to be firing back against accusations from the Trump administration that China mishandled or deliberately delayed releasing information about the outbreak, first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.Zhao said the U.S. should “focus more on fighting the epidemic and safeguarding the lives and health of the American people, and stop playing such buck-passing game.”Australia said it will push for an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus even if it hurts trade relations with China. Prime Minister Scott Morrison had been accused of playing “deputy sheriff” to the United States after calling for the inquiry.Morrison brushed off the criticism, telling reporters: “We have always been independent, we have always pursued our national interests, and we always will.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-hits-philippines-as-some-places-see-covid-pandemic-relief/story-sMVCLP3178LGm9OmtUz6ZP.html
14-05-2020||World||Fresh test for Wuhan as cluster sparks mass coronavirus screening||Nervous residents of China’s pandemic epicentre of Wuhan queued up across the city to be tested for the coronavirus on Thursday after a new cluster of cases sparked a mass screening campaign.Lines of socially distanced people formed at makeshift testing sites set up under tents in parking lots, parks and residential communities as it rained in the metropolis of 11 million people.“This is a good thing. It’s a way to be responsible toward others and to yourself,” a 40-year-old man told AFP after completing the process.He had already been tested 10 days before but given Wuhan’s history as the source of the virus and China’s worst-hit city, he welcomed a little extra insurance. The man added: “If you have the opportunity, wouldn’t you do it again?”The previously unknown contagion emerged in Wuhan late last year, prompting the Chinese government to impose a tight lockdown on the city on January 23, isolating the industrial and transport centre from the rest of the country and confining residents to their homes.More than 3,800 people have died from COVID-19 in the city, accounting for the vast majority of fatalities in China.The quarantine was only fully lifted in early April, and life is returning to normal.But Wuhan was given a fresh jolt when several new local infections emerged last weekend after more than a month in which none were reported.Fearful of a reliving the virus nightmare, officials have launched a drive to conduct nucleic acid tests on the city’s entire population.Men, women, children and the elderly filed forward to medical workers in head-to-toe white protective suits and plastic face shields, who recorded their personal details before quickly jabbing a swab into the backs of their throats.On edge Some remained anxious.“I know this plan requiring the city to do large-scale testing serves as a basic safeguard. I wasn’t planning to get myself tested,” said a woman who did not give her name.“But the safety measures inside are really bad. (People) are too close, and the testing person handled a lot of samples from people but I didn’t see him wash his hands.”China has largely brought the virus under control, but has been on edge recently about a potential second wave of infections as it has lifted lockdowns and restrictions across the country.Besides the six new Wuhan cases, virus clusters have appeared in recent weeks in the northeastern provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang, which border Russia.With the virus taking hold in other nations, China has barred most foreigners from entering the country.Despite the lingering concerns, pandemic-hardened residents of Wuhan have done their best to resume their lives.Dozens of people kicked up their heels to Chinese folk music on a promenade by the Yangtze River on Wednesday night, shrugging off the concerns of a new wave.Couples wearing masks pranced under street lamps, with the men leading the women into turns near a bridge lit with huge Chinese characters saying: “Go Wuhan”.“I’m very happy (to be dancing outside),” said Qiu Jumei, a 53-year-old hotel waitress.“The atmosphere wasn’t the same when I was at home and dancing alone. It was not fun,” she added. “This is much better.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fresh-test-for-wuhan-as-cluster-sparks-mass-coronavirus-screening/story-ShOqZtikEqXflNBgHTwq6K.html

The publication said that officials in the Chinese government were angered by U.S. criticism of China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.Trump said Thursday that while he still suspects the outbreak may be connected to a virology lab in Wuhan, China, he said it was unlikely the Chinese deliberately unleashed the pathogen. “I think more likely it got out of control,” he said.The president agreed with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo that China is trying to steal intellectual property and beat the U.S. to a coronavirus vaccine.“We can stop them, they’re going to try doing it,” he said. “I mean, you can stop doing business with them, that’s one thing.”He didn’t elaborate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-won-t-renegotiate-phase-one-china-trade-deal/story-vKunwJ54uNozgAkykDVk5J.html

14-05-2020||World||Mallya extradition in homestretch after appeal blocked, countdown starts||The extradition of businessman Vijay Mallya to face charges of major financial offences neared on Thursday after the high court of England and Wales refused him permission to appeal in the UK Supreme Court on the ground that his case does not involve a ‘point of law of general public importance’.The development marks one of the last stages of Mallya’s long-drawn extradition process that began with his arrest in London in April 2017. The high court decision means that the extradition will need to be carried out within 28 days as set out in the Extradition Act, 2003.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) acting on India’s behalf said Mallya was refused permission on all his three points: to hear oral submissions, to grant a certificate on the questions as drafted by his defence team, and to grant permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.The decision of judges Stephen Irwin and Elisabeth Laing was based ‘on papers’ presented, not in an open court based on oral hearings, and communicated by email to CPS and Mallya’s defence team.Officials said that if the pronouncement were being made in an open court it would have been: “The Court having signified its intention to refuse to certify a point of law of general public importance with a view to an appeal to the Supreme Court, the case has been listed for pronouncement, without attendance of the parties, as this has the effect of fixing the start date of the ‘required period’, as defined by section 36 and section 118 of the Extradition Act 2003, within which the extradition must be carried out”.Mallya has the option of approaching the European Court of Human Rights on the ground that his human rights would be at risk if extradited, but the CPS said “the removal process however can continue until such time as it is stayed by the ECHR”. The UK remains subject to the jurisdiction of ECHR until the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31.Nick Vamos, former head of extraditions at CPS, said: “Mallya can renew his appeal on human rights grounds if the circumstances change, for example if his health significantly worsened. He can also appeal to the European Court of Human Rights, although there is no guarantee that it will hear his case”.“Both of these options are long shots and neither of them stops the Indian and UK authorities from now making the practical arrangements to surrender Mallya into Indian custody as soon as possible. I imagine the flight schedule is already being agreed”.Mallya reiterated on Thursday his offer to repay the loans his company Kingfisher airlines had taken from banks, and close the case. He tweeted: “Congratulations to the Government for a Covid 19 relief package.”“They can print as much currency as they want BUT should a small contributor like me who offers 100% payback of State owned Banks be constantly ignored? Please take my money unconditionally and close”.Vijay Mallya extradition case timeline:--- March 2, 2016: Arrives in London from India.--- February 21, 2017: India’s extradition request certified by Home secretary.--- April 18, 2017: Arrested and bailed.--- April 24, 2017: Indian passport revoked.--- May 2, 2017: Resigns as member of Rajya Sabha.--- June 13, 2017: Series of case management and extradition hearings in the Westminster Magistrates Court.--- December 10, 2018: Chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot clears extradition and sends file to home secretary.--- February 3, 2019: Home secretary orders extradition to India.--- April 5, 2019: Judge David of the high court of England and Wales refuses permission on papers to appeal.--- July 2, 2019: In an oral hearing, Judge Leggatt and Judge Popplewell allow permission to appeal on the ground that the Arbuthnot was wrong to conclude that India had established a prima facie case against Mallya.--- May 11-13, 2019: Judge Irwin and Judge Laing hear appeal.--- April 20, 2020: Appeal refused.--- May 14, 2020: High court refuses permission to approach the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vijay-mallya-s-extradition-nears-after-refused-recourse-to-supreme-court/story-7K9Ii8xSPHI2VL5tFkZwiP.html

The issue was dealt with in exhaustive detail in the Vijay Mallya case, in which the Westminster Magistrates Court upheld India’s assurances and details submitted.Similar objections have been raised by Modi’s defence team – including alleged presence of rats, insects, uncovered drains and noise from slums near the jail – as part of its contention that there is risk to his human rights in the Arthur Road jail.UK courts are obliged to refuse extradition if there is a risk to the requested person’s human rights in the country that makes the extradition request.As in the Mallya case, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) opposed Modi’s claims in its ‘skeleton argument’, stating that his submissions “fail to acknowledge the recent consideration of this issue in the Mallya proceedings” by judge Emma Arbuthnot of the magistrates court in her December 2018 judgement.The CPS documents states: “In Mallya, the Senior District Judge was required to consider assurances offered by the GOI (government of India) in the same terms as those offered in this case. She conducted an exhaustive consideration of whether those assurance could be accepted…She concluded that they could be accepted”.The assurances provided by the ministry of home affairs, the CPS told the court, are plainly sufficient to meet the concerns raised by Modi’s team. The document goes on to specifically address points raised and cited video footage of the jail and other submissions as evidence:Overcrowding: Barrack No. 12 has two cells, with a maximum capacity of six inmates (per cell). The RP (requested person) would be provided a minimum of 3 square meters of personal space throughout the course of his detention. The video of the cell amply demonstrates availability of sufficient space.Heat, noise and lack of privacy: This is not accepted. Barrack No. 12 has adequate space, which ensures privacy. The cell is well ventilated and provides adequate air circulation and the concern about heat is unfounded. There is no noise in the cell which is separated from its surroundings by at least 20 feet by way of thick high stone walls.Metal casing causing excessive heat in the cell: The metal casing starts after clearing a ground level of 20 feet and provides a security cover to the cell. The ground clearance of 20 feet ensures adequate air circulation and actually helps in regulating temperatures. Further the ceiling is about 20 feet high and hence naturally cool in summers. Mumbai has a moderate climate and does not experience extreme temperature.Insufficient/natural light: The video amply shows adequate natural light enough to allow reading during day time. In addition, there are ‘06 tube lights’ to afford adequate artificial light at night. The lights are shown in the video.Dust and noise pollution from the adjoining slum areas: The concern is unfounded as the cell is separated from the outside area by way of a thick 20 feet high stone wall.Uncovered drains and presence of rats and insects: The video clearly shows that there are no uncovered drains in and around Barrack No.12. There are no rats or insects in the cell, another fact demonstrated by the video. The assurance further provides that the Municipal Corporation visits Barrack No. 12 once a week and fumigates the barrack.Absence of pharmacy/medicines: Round the clock medicare facilities assured by the government of India naturally include medicines as prescribed by doctors and specialists and the same would be provided to the RP as and when so prescribed.Access to hospitals: A 24-hour ambulance service is available to carry inmates to the nearby hospitals if required.Emergency access to hospitals: The ambulance service is available 24 hours a day.The CPS said India has provided “comprehensive rebuttals” to the evidence served on Modi’s behalf, adding that “no evidence has been served that justifies a departure from the approach taken in Mallya”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nirav-modi-cites-rats-insects-in-mumbai-jail-to-avoid-extradition/story-tH1bAJmuekLdVAsTSgC1AM.html
14-05-2020||World||World leaders demand free coronavirus vaccine for all||World leaders past and present insisted on Thursday that any eventual COVID-19 vaccines and treatments should be made available to everyone, free of charge.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan were among more than 140 signatories of a letter saying any vaccine should not be patented while the science should be shared between nations.The World Health Assembly, the policy-setting body of the UN’s World Health Organization, holds its annual general meeting next week.The signatories called on the WHA to rally behind the cause.“Governments and international partners must unite around a global guarantee which ensures that, when a safe and effective vaccine is developed, it is produced rapidly at scale and made available for all people, in all countries, free of charge,” the letter said.“The same applies for all treatments, diagnostics, and other technologies for COVID-19.”The letter was signed by Senegalese President Macky Sall and Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo.Former presidents and prime ministers among the signatories included Shaukat Aziz, Jan Peter Balkenende, Jose Manuel Barroso, Gordon Brown, Helen Clark, Felipe Gonzalez, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Aleksander Kwasniewski, Mary McAleese, Olusegun Obasanjo and Juan Manuel Santos.The letter comes amid fury in France after pharmaceutical giant Sanofi said it would reserve first shipments of any COVID-19 vaccine for the United States.The French multinational’s chief executive Paul Hudson said the United States would get first dibs because its government was helping to fund the vaccine research.His comments drew outrage Thursday from officials and health experts.The letter ahead of the WHA said it was not the time to leave the task of resolving the pandemic to market forces or let the interests of wealthy companies and governments come before the need to save lives.African Union Chairperson Ramaphosa said: “As the countries of Africa, we are resolute that the COVID-19 vaccine must be patent-free, rapidly made and distributed, and free for all.“Nobody should be pushed to the back of the vaccine queue because of where they live or what they earn.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-leaders-demand-free-coronavirus-vaccine-for-all/story-OdReUYrEPiigyZFV48cC4L.html
14-05-2020||World||UN economic experts hail India’s ‘impressive’ stimulus package to revive Covid hit economy||Top UN experts have hailed as “impressive” India’s Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package, the largest so far among the developing countries, to revive its economy, which has been severely hit by the coronavirus-triggered lockdown.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced massive new financial incentives on top of the previously announced packages for a combined stimulus of Rs 20 lakh crore (USD 260 billion).While launching the World Economic Situation and Prospect (WESP) report update on Wednesday, Chief of the Global Economic Monitoring Branch Hamid Rashid told reporters in response to a question that the stimulus package announced by the Indian government on Tuesday “is a very welcome development.” He said the Rs 20 lakh crore package, which is 10 per cent of India’s GDP is the “largest so far in the developing countries” because most developing countries have been rolling out stimulus packages that are between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent of the GDP.“India’s stimulus packages are very large. And also India has the domestic financial market and the large capacity to implement that large stimulus package,” he said, adding that impact of the package would depend on the design of the stimulus.The mega Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package includes previously announced measures to save the lockdown-battered economy, and focuses on tax breaks for small businesses as well as incentives for domestic manufacturing.The combined package works out to roughly 10 per cent of the GDP, making it among the most substantial in the world after the financial packages announced by the US, which is 13 per cent of its GDP, and by Japan, which is over 21 per cent of its GDP.Associate Economic Affairs Officer, Economic Analysis and Policy Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (EAPD/UN DESA) Julian Slotman told PTI in an interview that the size of India’s stimulus package is “impressive” and “seems to be of a magnitude that will help to reassure markets and to boost domestic consumption. But at the same time when people are simply not able to spend, you cannot expect the economic growth to suddenly magically re-appear.” Lauding the Indian government for implementing a strict lockdown while the number of COVID19 cases was relatively low, he said at some point it will be inevitable to gradually ease the restrictions but warned that that could result in infections increasing in the country.“Fortunately in India, the central government acted very decisively in implementing the national lockdown” when the number of virus cases was relatively low and “it seems to have slowed the spread of the disease somewhat,” he said.“The decisive containment measures are absolutely critically necessary and a strong lockdown is critical in India,” he said, adding that the duration of the lockdown has to also be economically feasible.“It is putting tremendous pressure on the Indian economy and of course disproportionately hurting the people that are the most vulnerable and poor.” He said that in India, priority must be given to reduce uncertainty first so that people can eventually go out and spend again.He urged the Indian government to exercise maximum caution in easing the lockdown, saying the country should “not hasten anything unnecessarily. There are ways to gradually lift restrictions,” he said.He added that with a large informal sector in India, the lockdown has disproportionately affected women and migrant workers. Meanwhile, the UN on Wednesday slashed India’s projected GDP growth rate to 1.2 per cent in 2020-21 as the COVID19 pandemic ravages the global economy. In the WESP report update, the UN DESA said that global GDP is forecast to contract sharply by 3.2 per cent as the COVID-19 pandemic paralyses the world, sharply restricting economic activities, increasing uncertainties and unleashing a recession unseen since the Great Depression.“Cumulatively, the world economy is expected to lose nearly USD 8.5 trillion in output in 2020 and 2021, nearly wiping out the cumulative output gains of the previous four years,” the report said.India’s economic growth is forecast to slow to 1.2 per cent in the current fiscal, a further deterioration from the already slowed growth of 4.1 per cent in 2019. India, which grew at 6.8 per cent in fiscal year 2018, is forecast to recover and clock a 5.5 per cent growth rate in 2021.The Economic Survey, released a day before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Union Budget for 2020-21 on February 1, had projected a GDP growth of 6-6.5 per cent, up from 5 per cent estimate for 2019-20.“The national lockdown in India, for example, is expected to depress economic growth to just 1.2 per cent, much lower than the already disappointing growth in 2019,” the report said.Despite the considerably slowed growth rate of 1.2 per cent, India is still the second fastest-growing major economy in the world after China.According to estimates in the report, India and China are the only two economies in the world that are not projected to shrink in 2020 even though their growth rates slow down considerably. While India could clock a 1.2 per cent GDP growth, China is estimated to record a 1.7 per cent growth rate.All other economies in the world, including the US (-4.8 per cent), Japan (-4.2 per cent), European Union (-5.5 per cent) and the United Kingdom (-5.4 per cent) are projected to shrink this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-economic-experts-hail-india-s-impressive-stimulus-package-to-revive-covid-hit-economy/story-iT1331LokbUccpA9GzzTHP.html

This is quite regrettable.”While the WHO has done good work and contributed to world health in the past, its record on the virus has not been as good, Chen added.“On the Wuhan pneumonia, we mostly criticise them for acting too slowly,” he said, referring to the central Chinese city where the virus first emerged late last year, before spreading worldwide to infect 4.3 million people and kill 295,000.Chen, who was Taiwan’s health minister during the 2002-2003 SARS crisis, said the world needed to be cautious with China’s virus numbers, and urged Beijing to be more transparent.He wished China well in its fight, however.“Here I give my blessings to them and hope that they can contain the Wuhan pneumonia as early as possible and avoid a second wave,” said Chen, who leaves office when President Tsai Ing-wen is sworn in for her second term next week.Taiwan has lobbied to attend next week’s meeting of the WHO’s decision-making World Health Assembly as an observer, but China objects.In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Taiwan’s basis for participation in the WHO was damaged by the refusal of its ruling Democratic Progressive Party to recognise that the island is part of China.There is no legal basis for a “non-sovereign region” to participate as an observer, Zhao added.The United States has repeatedly clashed with China over its refusal to allow Taiwan full access to the body, helping to further fuel tension between Washington and Beijing.Taiwan’s tally of 440 virus infections and seven deaths is far lower than many of its neighbours, thanks to early and effective prevention work and an efficient public health system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-taiwan-says-who-has-forgotten-neutrality-by-barring-island/story-aVmKVxzIQaEYGxeCkYYF6N.html

But again I have to stress that this is a best-case scenario, we know not all vaccines that come into development may not make it to authorisation and disappear,” he added.“We know also that there may be delays.”The agency was however “a bit sceptical” about reports that a vaccine could be ready as soon as September.The Amsterdam-based EU agency meanwhile played down fears expressed by the World Health Organization that the virus “may never go away”.“I think it’s a bit early to say but we have good reason to be sufficiently optimistic that some vaccines will make it,” Cavaleri said.“I would be surprised that if at the end of the day we don’t have any vaccine for COVID-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-a-year-eu-agency/story-cI9F9IxZAnW2FM88t8DzjM.html
14-05-2020||World||Cape Town becomes center of South Africa’s coronavirus pandemic||The coronavirus outbreak in South Africa has hit hardest in the Western Cape, home to the city of Cape Town. The province now has more than half of the 12,074 confirmed cases nationwide and in recent days contributed about 90% of new infections recorded by the Health Ministry.Contrary to initial projections, infections and deaths have increased at a much slower rate in the economic hub of Johannesburg in Gauteng province. The Western Cape and Gauteng together account for about 37% of South Africa’s population. The Western Cape has registered 117 virus-related deaths out of 219 nationwide, and Gauteng 24. Most of the infections and deaths have been in Cape Town, one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations.Click here for full coronavirus coverageWhile Western Cape authorities attribute the surge in cases to “a rigorous approach to testing,” the province is facing clusters of infections in households, work places and supermarkets. That explains why the area also has a higher number of people who test positive -- between 7% to 9%, compared to a national average of between 2% to 3%, according to Tulio de Oliveira, a bioinformatician with the Nelson R. Mandela School of Medicine at the University of KwaZulu Natal.“Localized outbreaks are common,” De Oliveira said. “We’ve seen it in nursing homes in the U.K. and recently in nightclubs in South Korea. It’s the normal biology of the virus and it’s happening at a higher frequency in the Western Cape.”The rest of the country is unlikely to be spared.“We may eventually see this in other parts of the country,” he said. “The question isn’t why it hasn’t happened in Gauteng, but why it hasn’t happened yet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cape-town-becomes-center-of-south-africa-s-coronavirus-pandemic/story-wQctB2schGUYdCogTPru1O.html
14-05-2020||World||Canadian favourability towards China ‘at a new low’: Report||The attitude of Canadians about China has taken a sharp nosedive over the last months with just 14 per cent feeling positive about the Asian nation, and much of this dislike is precipitated by strong distrust of Beijing over its transparency in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAccording to a new public opinion poll, Canadian favourability towards China is “at a new low.” The non-profit polling agency Angus Reid Institute or ARI noted, “As nations have responded to the pandemic, Canadian views towards China are in an apparent free-fall, as favourability of the nation hits a new low, dropping to 14 per cent – half of where it was in late 2019, and representing just a quarter of where favourability towards China stood in 2017.”Some of that decline can be attributed to a perceived lack of openness from China that may have contributed to the coronavirus crisis. As the pollster said, “More than four-in-five (85%) Canadians say the Chinese government has not been honest about what has happened in its own country.” These negative leanings towards China are also leading Canadians to be against the participation of the Chinese company Huawei in 5G infrastructure in Canada and overall against increasing trade with China. As the poll found: “If Canadians had their way, there would be real-world consequences to perceived malfeasance on the part of the Asian power. Just 11 per cent of Canadians say Canada should focus its trade efforts on China, down from 40 per cent in 2015. Further, four-in-five say Canada should bar Huawei from taking part in the building of new 5G infrastructure in this country.”The fall in the percentage of Canadians with a positive view of China is perceptible. In 58 per cent could be considered pro-China, and that figure was at 48 per cent even in 2017. But 2018 proved a watershed year in relations between Canada and China.As ARI stated, “Canadian opinion towards China has significantly declined since that government arrested and detained two Canadians in prison, in a tit-for-tat reaction to Canada’s arrest – and subsequent release on bail – of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.”Compounding matters has been the alleged cover-up by China that led to Covid-19 going global. ARI said Canadians appear to share ‘concerns” such as those voiced by United States officials. As much as 85 per cent of those polled either strongly disagreed or disagreed with the statement that ‘The Chinese government has been transparent and honest about the Covid-19 situation in that country.’Preference for strengthening the trade relation between Canada and China has also plummeted from 40 per cent supporting it in April 2015 to just 11 per cent in May 2020. And only 14 per cent are for allowing Huawei to play a role in building 5G mobile networks in Canada as against 21 per cent in November last year.In effect, Canadians want the nature of the relationship to alter dramatically, as the poll stated, “Three-quarters (76%) of Canadians now say the most important aspect of their country’s relationship with China should be upholding human rights and the rule of law, not trade investment and opportunity. This represents a hardening of opinion over the last 18 months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-favourability-towards-china-at-a-new-low/story-2xNQYLI7sDnLRTAfPkLdxN.html
14-05-2020||World||Twin antibodies that may help fight Covid-19 identified||Scientists have identified a pair of neutralising antibodies -- isolated from a patient who recovered from COVID-19 -- that may offer therapeutic benefits, and help design molecule antivirals and vaccine candidates to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The antibodies identified by the researchers, including those from Chinese Academy of Sciences, bind to the glycoprotein spike of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, blocking the spike’s ability to bind to the human ACE2 receptor and mediate viral entry into host cells. Preliminary tests of the two antibodies, named B38 and H4, in a mouse model resulted in a reduction of virus titers, the researchers said. The finding, published in the journal Science, suggests that the antibodies may offer therapeutic benefits -- in addition to informing the design of small molecule therapeutics and vaccine candidates to fight COVID-19, they said. Researcher Yan Wu from Capital Medical University, China and colleagues found that the antibodies can each bind simultaneously to different epitopes on the spike’s receptor binding domain (RBD). Due to this binding, both antibodies together may confer a stronger neutralising effect than either antibody on its own -- a prediction supported by in vitro experiments, they said. This feature also means that, should one of the viral epitopes mutate in a way that prevents the binding of one of the two antibodies, the other may still retain its neutralising activity, according to the researchers. By imaging the structure of the viral spike’s RBD bound to B38, the team confirmed that the antibody binds to a subset of the amino acids bound by ACE2, they said. This, the researchers explained, provides an explanation for why the B38 antibody confers such strong neutralising effects. They suggest that a “cocktail” containing both antibodies could provide direct therapeutic benefits for COVID-19 patients. The finding regarding the viral spike epitopes could also aid the development of small molecule antivirals and vaccine candidates to fight the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the researchers added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twin-antibodies-that-may-help-fight-covid-19-identified/story-53uLLj6ZQdlKRG0vUK1KjI.html

14-05-2020||World||‘Covid-19 has seeds of major mental health crisis’, says UN chief||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged governments, civil society and health authorities on Wednesday to urgently address mental health needs arising from the coronavirus pandemic, warning that psychological suffering is increasing.The UN chief said in a video message launching a policy briefing that “after decades of neglect and under-investment in mental health services, the Covid-19 pandemic is now hitting families and communities with additional mental stress.”He pointed to “grief at the loss of loved ones, shock at the loss of jobs, isolation and restrictions on movement, difficult family dynamics, and uncertainty and fear for the future.”Guterres said those most at risk and in need of help are front-line health care workers, older people, adolescents, young people, those with preexisting mental health conditions, and those caught up in conflict and crisis.“Mental health services are an essential part of all government responses to COVID-19,” he said. “They must be expanded and fully funded.”The 17-page UN briefing stressed that “the mental health and well-being of whole societies have been severely impacted by this crisis and are a priority to be addressed urgently.”The UN said “a long-term upsurge in the number and severity of mental health problems is likely” and warned that if action isn’t taken COVID-19 “has the seeds of a major mental health crisis” as well as “a physical health crisis.”The briefing cited widespread psychological distress from the immediate health aspects of the virus, the consequences of physical isolation, fear of infection, dying and losing family members, physical distancing from loved ones and peers, and economic turmoil.“Frequent misinformation and rumors about the virus and deep uncertainty about the future are common sources of distress,” the UN briefing said.“In every community, there are numerous older adults and people with preexisting health conditions who are terrified and lonely,” it said. “Emotional difficulties among children and adolescents are exacerbated by family stress, social isolation, with some facing increased abuse, disrupted education and uncertainty about their futures.”Because of the size of the problem, the UN said, most mental health needs remain unaddressed.It pointed to a historic under-investment in mental health needs and called for the widespread availability of emergency mental health and psychological support during the pandemic.The UN also urged the development of mental health services for the future “to support society’s recovery from COVID-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-has-seeds-of-major-mental-health-crisis-says-un-chief/story-BJpkLTl7CSNUhcPrICZvbK.html
14-05-2020||World||Truck bomb in eastern Afghanistan’s Gardez kills five, 14 injured||A truck packed with explosives blew up near a court in the eastern Afghan city of Gardez on Thursday, killing at least five people, two days after gunmen attacked a maternity ward in the capital Kabul, killing women and newborn babies.“A car bomb explosion took place near a military court in Gardez city, which is a populated area. Dozens of civilians are feared to be dead and wounded,” said Tariq Arian, an interior ministry spokesman. Emal Khan Momand, a military spokesman in Paktia province where Gardez is located, said the attack was carried out by a truck packed with explosives. Five people were killed and 14 were wounded, he said.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast. Arian blamed the militant Haqqani network, which has ties to Taliban rebels and the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group. These groups rarely publicly claim responsibility for attacks.The blast comes after a violent week in which gunmen attacked a maternity hospital in Kabul, killing 24 people, including new mothers and newborn babies, on Tuesday. A suicide blast claimed by the Islamic State at a funeral in eastern Nangahar on the same day killed 32.President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attacks and said he had ordered the military to switch to offensive mode rather than the defensive stance it had adopted as the United States withdraws troops and tries to broker talks with the Taliban.The Taliban has denied any involvement in the attacks, but the government has accused the group of fostering an environment in which terrorism thrives or working with other militant groups who could have been involved, straining efforts by the United States to bring the insurgents and the Afghan government together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/truck-bomb-in-eastern-afghanistan-s-gardez-kills-five-14-injured/story-yfbrQdLzCObaEKNxymdFSJ.html
14-05-2020||World||SCO foreign ministers discuss consensus approach for peace, stability in Afghanistan||The need for a consensus approach to establish peace in Afghanistan figured in a video conference of foreign ministers of SCO states on Wednesday, with external affairs minister S Jaishankar seeking collective action to root out terrorism that threatens regional peace.Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, who convened the meeting, said the US-Taliban agreement had stalled and a settlement in Afghanistan would be possible only if it accommodates the interests of the war-torn country’s closest neighbours.Most of the discussions during the video conference, also joined by Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, centred round the Covid-19 crisis and the need for coordinated efforts to deal with its trade, economic and social consequences.During his address, Jaishankar emphasised that security challenges faced by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) states “are not linked by physical or political boundaries”. He added, “Terrorism continues to be the overwhelming threat to security and stability in the SCO region and would require collective action.”In an apparent reference to Pakistan, he added, “Even as the world fights Covid-19, some are busy spreading other deadly viruses such as terrorism. Fake news and doctored videos are also used to divide communities and countries…”The world community had seen the prospect of growth evaporate because of the pandemic and this will mean many in India won’t be able to overcome poverty, Jaishankar said. The crisis also disrupted production networks and supply chains and SCO states should identify new ways to sustain economic growth, he said.Lavrov, in his address to the video conference, said the situation in Afghanistan poses a serious challenge to regional security. The situation, he added, had worsened despite steps taken to push forward the peace process.“It is obvious that political settlement and putting Afghanistan on the peaceful track is impossible without the participation of the countries in the region,” he said, adding mechanisms such as the Moscow Format and the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group could help provide solutions.A senior Russian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “Russia has always favoured a consensus approach because a solution will have to involve all the countries in the region.” The SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group is better placed to provide solutions and take forward the peace process because it includes key players in the region and Afghanistan itself, the official said.Lavrov also spoke about the need to strengthen SCO’s Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure (RATS), headquartered in Tashkent, and the need to adapt a roadmap of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group, which was framed during a meeting in Bishkek in 2019, to the new environment in Afghanistan, including the US-Taliban negotiations.Addressing a news briefing after the video conference, Lavrov said a settlement in Afghanistan would only be possible “based on the interests of the Afghan people and the legitimate interests of countries of the region, including the closest neighbours of Afghanistan”.“The US decided to focus only on their bilateral negotiations with the Taliban. We have nothing against it if it…takes into accounts the interests of all parties and neighbours. It is necessary to more actively involve the neighbours so that they can secure their interests,” he said.“We are not happy that the US-Taliban deal has been stalling...and we are ready to help the parties to overcome these problems. For this, we need to go back to inclusive dialogue in Afghanistan,” Lavrov added.The video conference was also joined by the foreign ministers of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The conference also discussed preparations for the SCO foreign ministers’ meeting in Moscow during June 9-10 and the SCO Summit in St Petersburg during July 22-23.The Russian official cited above said the Covid-19 situation continues to be dynamic and a final decision on whether the upcoming meetings will be held via video conference will be made after an assessment closer to the dates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sco-foreign-ministers-discuss-consensus-approach-for-peace-stability-in-afghanistan/story-FF6Ofr81ozHoBUc1VFTxQN.html
14-05-2020||World||Japan expected to end state of emergency for most regions; Tokyo to stay on alert||Japan was expected to lift a state of emergency across a large part of the country on Thursday, but the capital Tokyo will remain under restrictions until there is a convincing containment of the coronavirus.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is scheduled to hold a news conference at 6 p.m. (0900 GMT) where media said he is expected to announce the lifting of the state of emergency for 39 of Japan’s 47 prefectures, but not including Tokyo.The world’s third-largest economy declared a nationwide state of emergency a month ago, urging citizens to reduce person-to-person contact by 80% in an effort to slow the pace of new infections and ease the strain on medical services. The government had said it would reassess the situation in mid-May.The declaration gives governors added authority to tell people to stay home and close schools and businesses, but there is no penalty for non-compliance. Some non-essential businesses even in hard-hit areas have already started to reopen ahead of the government’s review, and the scope of restrictions has varied across the country.Abe, like leaders everywhere, is striving to strike a balance between damage to the economy from prolonged shutdowns and the need to contain the virus. The government is set to add four economists to its advisory panel for combating the epidemic, and another review will be conducted again in about a week.Economists said any normalisation would be gradual as the government treads cautiously with an eye on a possible second wave of infections such as seen in countries such as South Korea and China.“The focus is whether the government will lift the emergency on the big areas such as Tokyo and Osaka before the end of May, as was initially planned,” said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Research Institute.“If it does, economic recovery will likely be faster than previously estimated.”The 39 prefectures account for 54% of Japan’s population, while the greater Tokyo area that will remain under the state of emergency represents about a third of the economy.“Tokyo is the heart of the Japanese economy. It’s like driving a car with three wheels,” said Jesper Koll, chief executive of asset manager WisdomTree Japan.Fast Retailing Co, owner of casual clothing chain Uniqlo, which had already started to reopen outlets across the country, said it planned further reopenings from Friday after the state of emergency is lifted.Japan has reported 16,100 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, excluding those from a cruise ship previously quarantined in Yokohama, and 696 deaths to date from the disease it causes, COVID-19, according to public broadcaster NHK.While Japan has avoided the kind of explosive growth seen in the United States and elsewhere, its testing has also been among the lowest, at 188 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests per 100,000 people, versus 3,159 in Italy and 3,044 in Germany.Hardest-hit Tokyo has conducted just 50,000 tests so far, of which about 5,000 were positive. Although Japan’s state of emergency declaration lacks enforcement powers, mobility data has shown a marked drop in the movement of people. The government this week reported a 20% fall in the number of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the nine days to May 7, to 4,449. In Tokyo, new cases fell to just 10 on Wednesday.Osaka, Japan’s second-biggest metropolis, is also set to remain a target of the state of emergency, but the governor has announced criteria for gradually lifting some restraints on businesses including eateries and bars.

14-05-2020||World||Gastrointestinal symptoms could indicate Covid-19 infection in kids: Study||Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, coupled with a fever or history of exposure to Covid-19, could indicate coronavirus infection in children, according to a new study.Published in the journal Frontiers in Pediatrics, the research also suggests that the gastrointestinal symptoms first suffered by some children hint at potential infection through the digestive tract, as the type of receptors in cells in the lungs targeted by the virus can also be found in the intestines.“Most children are only mildly affected by Covid-19 and the few severe cases often have underlying health issues. It is easy to miss its diagnosis in the early stage when a child has non-respiratory symptoms or suffers from another illness,” said study author Dr Wenbin Li from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.“Based on our experience of dealing with Covid-19, in regions where this virus is epidemic, children suffering from digestive tract symptoms, especially with fever and/or a history of exposure to this disease, should be suspected of being infected with this virus,” he continued.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn this study, the research team detail the clinical features of children admitted to hospital with non-respiratory symptoms, which were subsequently diagnosed with pneumonia and Covid-19.“These children were seeking medical advice in the emergency department for unrelated problems, for example, one had a kidney stone, another a head trauma,” said researchers.All had pneumonia confirmed by chest CT scan before or soon after admission and then confirmed to have Covid-19. While their initial symptoms may have been unrelated, or their Covid-19 symptoms were initially mild or relatively hidden before their admission to hospital, importantly, four of the five cases had digestive tract symptoms as the first manifestation of this disease.The researchers also link the children’s gastrointestinal symptoms, which have been recorded in adult patients, to an additional potential route of infection.“The gastrointestinal symptoms experienced by these children may be related to the distribution of receptors and the transmission pathway associated with Covid-19 infection in humans. The virus infects people via the ACE2 receptor, which can be found in certain cells in the lungs as well as the intestines,” Li said.This suggests that Covid-19 might infect patients not only through the respiratory tract in the form of air droplets but also through the digestive tract by contact or faecal-oral transmission.“We report five cases of Covid-19 in children showing non-respiratory symptoms as the first manifestation after admission to hospital. The incidence and clinical features of similar cases need further study in more patients,” the researchers noted.By highlighting these cases, the researchers hope that doctors will use this information to quickly diagnose and isolate patients with similar symptoms, which will aid early treatment and reduce transmission.In March, another study from China, published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology, found that diarrhoea was a prominent symptom among up to half of the patients with Covid-19 in Wuhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gastrointestinal-symptoms-could-indicate-covid-19-infection-in-kids-study/story-AkkIQTp77R1nBtYyTogU2L.html
14-05-2020||World||A vaccine for Covid-19 won’t be enough to end the pandemic: Report||Medical experts have warned that the volume of vaccine available to fight the coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 in coming years is expected to fall far short of global demand, despite an unprecedented effort to manufacture billions of doses.About 70 per cent of the world’s population -- or 5.6 billion people -- will probably need to be inoculated to begin to establish herd immunity and slow its spread, The Washington Post reported citing scientific research on Monday.The scenario public health experts fear most is a worldwide fight in which manufacturers will sell only to the highest bidders, rich countries trying to buy up the supplies, and nations where manufacturers have located hoard vaccines for their own citizens.“The model of countries thinking only of themselves is not going to work. Even if you’re living somewhere that’s somehow perfectly without any infections, your best efforts to fight the virus are going to fail unless you shut off all your borders and trade,” said Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, a public-private partnership that helps provide vaccines to developing countries.“This is a global problem that requires a global solution,” he added.International health advocates want to avoid a repeat of 2009, when wealthy countries -- including the United States, led by former President Barack Obama -- were at the head of the line for H1N1 swine-flu vaccine, leaving underdeveloped countries with little supply until after the pandemic subsided.Such an approach will be sorely tested by current US President Trump and other world leaders with nationalistic impulses and their own anxious populations that want to reduce the deadly threat and bring their economies back to life.In the United States, the federal government agency in charge of emergency vaccine development indicated it is prioritizing domestic concerns -- an “America First” mentality that has shaped much of the Trump administration’s pandemic response.“Right now, we’re focused on the whole-of-America approach required to expedite the availability of vaccines,” Gary Disbrow, acting director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), said in an emailed response to the Post.BARDA, tasked with protecting Americans from biological threats, is channeling nearly half a billion dollars in emergency funds to Johnson & Johnson to develop a vaccine. It also is providing hundreds of millions of dollars in financial support for vaccine efforts by Sanofi, the large French drug company, and Moderna, a biotech company in Massachusetts teaming with a Swiss company for vaccine manufacturing.The global grab for protective equipment and ventilators that left poorer countries empty-handed suggests the competition over vaccines could be at least as fierce. Dozens of companies large and small are rushing to develop vaccines using different technologies and approaches.The race for a vaccine is full of risks because no one knows which projects will succeed. That forces companies to scale up to produce millions of doses of vaccine that might end up being worthless.It should also be noted that the United States might not be well-positioned if the best vaccines end up coming from other countries or international collaborations.This race could make large drug companies enter into vaccine contracts again as they face pressure to recoup their investments, the newspaper said further.“Rich countries monopolized the vaccine, poor countries were left behind,” Gavin Yamey, director of the Center for Policy Impact in Global Health at Duke University, said in a university podcast.“They got the vaccine later, and they got less of it.” Allowing a repeat scenario in the battle against the coronavirus would be a devastating mistake, he said.“Unless we make this vaccine globally available,” he said, “we are not going to be able to end the pandemic, because ... an outbreak anywhere is an outbreak everywhere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-vaccine-for-covid-19-won-t-be-enough-to-end-the-pandemic-report/story-2BBwfEYM8pCq5cisFfBl0N.html
14-05-2020||World||Covid-19 could become endemic like HIV, may never go away: WHO||The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 could become endemic like HIV, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday, warning against any attempt to predict how long it would keep circulating and calling for a “massive effort” to counter it.“It is important to put this on the table: this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,” WHO emergencies expert Mike Ryan told an online briefing.“I think it is important we are realistic and I don’t think anyone can predict when this disease will disappear,” he added. “I think there are no promises in this and there are no dates. This disease may settle into a long problem, or it may not be.”However, he said the world had some control over how it coped with the disease, although this would take a “massive effort” even if a vaccine was found -- a prospect he described as a “massive moonshot”.More than 100 potential vaccines are being developed, including several in clinical trials, but experts have underscored the difficulties of finding vaccines that are effective against coronaviruses.Ryan noted that vaccines exist for other illnesses, such as measles, that have not been eliminated.WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus added: “The trajectory is in our hands, and it’s everybody’s business, and we should all contribute to stop this pandemic.”Ryan said “very significant control” of the virus was required in order to lower the assessment of risk, which he said remained high at the “national, regional and global levels”.Governments around the world are struggling with the question of how to reopen their economies while still containing the virus, which has infected almost 4.3 million people, according to a Reuters tally, and led to over 291,000 deaths.The European Union pushed on Wednesday for a gradual reopening of borders within the bloc that have been shut by the pandemic, saying it was not too late to salvage some of the summer tourist season while still keeping people safe.But public health experts say extreme caution is needed to avoid new outbreaks. Ryan said opening land borders was less risky than easing air travel, which was a “different challenge”.“We need to get into the mindset that it is going to take some time to come out of this pandemic,” WHO epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove told the briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-could-become-endemic-like-hiv-may-never-go-away-who/story-ytoAVlix98ERO1QIbf4QbP.html

The company added it will be able to provide hundreds of thousands of antibody test kits to the UK per week.The Telegraph, which first reported the findings, stated that the government is in negotiations with Roche to buy millions of kits.UK’s Department of Health and Social Care was not immediately available for a Reuters request for comment.Health Secretary Matt Hancock had earlier said the government was in discussions with the Swiss drugmaker over antibody testing.Earlier this month, Roche’s antibody test won emergency approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. Unlike tests to diagnose diseases, antibody tests show who has been infected and recovered.As of Wednesday, UK recorded 33,186 deaths from Covid-19, the country worst-hit by the respiratory disease in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swiss-drugmaker-in-talks-with-uk-govt-to-roll-out-covid-antibody-test-kits/story-0mW7ok4FXxYLuJ3a6RxG9H.html
14-05-2020||World||Trump presses for US schools to reopen, takes dig at Fauci||President Donald Trump called on governors across the nation Wednesday to work to reopen schools that were closed because of the coronavirus, pointedly taking issue with Dr. Anthony Fauci’s caution against moving too quickly in sending students back to class.The president accused Fauci of wanting “to play all sides of the equation,” a comment that suggested he is tiring of the nation’s top infectious disease expert.“I think they should open the schools, absolutely. I think they should,” Trump told reporters at the White House, echoing comments he had made in a television interview. “Our country’s got to get back and it’s got to get back as soon as possible. And I don’t consider our country coming back if the schools are closed.”Fauci had urged caution in testimony before a Senate committee Tuesday, although he made clear that he believes reopening decisions will likely differ from one region to the next.“We don’t know everything about this virus and we really better be pretty careful, particularly when it comes to children,” Fauci told the committee. At one point, he told members that “the idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate the re-entry of students into the fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far.”Fauci later clarified that he was not implying students should be barred from returning to class until a Covid-19 vaccine is developed. But his comments were nonetheless seized on by conservative commentators, as well as Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who called the notion “kind of ridiculous.”Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“To me, it’s not an acceptable answer,” Trump said of Fauci on Wednesday. He said the coronavirus has “had very little impact on young people,” although there is growing concern over cases of a mysterious inflammatory syndrome in young people that is thought to be related to the virus.Speaking of Fauci, Trump told Maria Bartiromo in an interview for Fox Business Network’s ”Mornings with Maria” that “I totally disagree with him on schools.”Trump and Fauci have publicly disagreed before, including on the effectiveness of certain drugs that have been tested to treat the virus. Trump has also complained to aides and confidants about Fauci’s positive media attention and his willingness to contradict the president. But Trump has also acknowledge that the blowback to removing the doctor would be fierce.In his testimony, Fauci issued a blunt warning that cities and states could “turn back the clock” and see more death and economic damage if they lift stay-at-home orders too quickly — a message that stands in sharp contrast to Trump’s push to reopen the nation as he tries to blunt the economic damage caused by the pandemic during an election year.“There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control,” Fauci warned as more than two dozen states have begun to lift their lockdowns.Among those are Colorado and North Dakota, whose governors met with Trump on Wednesday.In North Dakota, which has had fewer cases than many other states, Republican Gov. Doug Burgum allowed most businesses to reopen May 1 with precautions that include limiting bars and restaurants to half capacity and requiring barbers and cosmetologists to wear masks.Burgum announced this week that schools may offer some summer programs beginning June 1 if local school officials approve and precautions are taken, such as limiting class sizes.At the same time, cases and deaths have continued to rise. State health officials on Tuesday reported two new deaths from Covid-19, bringing its death toll to 38. The state also reported 53 new cases, bringing the total to 1,571.Click here for Covid-19 updatesThe impact on Colorado has been far worse. The death toll there surpassed 1,000 this week, with more than 20,000 having tested positive.Democratic Gov. Jared Polis this month began to gradually relax restrictions, however, while warning there could be rollbacks if the virus surges.Polis had criticized the Federal Emergency Management Agency during the early days of the pandemic for swooping in to purchase personal protective equipment and other supplies that Colorado, like many states, had been negotiating for with private vendors. But recently he’s taken a more diplomatic approach to working with the administration.The White House has stepped up precautions in recent days to protect the president and senior administration officials from the virus after two individuals who work on the compound tested positive. Because he had contact with one of those individuals, Vice President Mike Pence has been keeping his distance from Trump, talking by phone instead of in person.“I haven’t seen Mike Pence and I miss him,” Trump said. “For a little while we’ll stay apart because you don’t know what happens with this very crazy and horrible disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-presses-for-us-schools-to-reopen-takes-dig-at-fauci/story-885C9mjw3DHsSkFpuJsQwL.html
14-05-2020||World||Spike in Covid-19 cases in US could emerge weeks after states reopen, say experts||US states are beginning to restart their economies after months of paralysing coronavirus lockdowns, but it could take weeks until it becomes clear whether those reopenings will cause a spike in Covid-19 cases, experts said Wednesday. The outbreak’s trajectory varies wildly across the country, with steep increases in cases in some places, decreases in others and infection rates that can shift dramatically from neighbourhood to neighbourhood. “Part of the challenge is although we are focused on the top-line national numbers in terms of our attention, what we are seeing is 50 different curves and 50 different stories playing out,” said Thomas Tsai, assistant professor at the Harvard Global Health Institute. “And what we have seen about COVID-19 is that the story and the effect is often very local.” A handful of states started easing their lockdowns about two weeks ago, ranging from shopping malls in Texas to beach hotels in South Carolina to gyms in Wyoming. Georgia was one of the first states where some businesses were allowed to open their doors again, starting April 24 with barber shops, hair salons, gyms, bowling alleys and tattoo parlors. But it may be five to six weeks from then before the effects are known, said Crystal Watson of Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “As we saw early in the year, epidemics of COVID-19 start slow and take some time to build and become evident,” Watson said in an email. The outbreak’s trajectory can vary greatly around the country, according to an Associated Press analysis of confirmed cases. For instance, steep increases in daily new cases are occurring in Hennepin County in Minnesota, and Fairfax County in Virginia, while in others, such as Bergen County, New Jersey, and Wayne County, Michigan, there’s been a steady decline. The AP analysed case counts compiled by Johns Hopkins University, using a rolling seven-day average to account for day-to-day variability in test reporting. In Geneva, meanwhile, a top World Health Organization official warned that it’s possible the new coronavirus may be here to stay. “This virus may never go away,” Dr Michael Ryan said at a press briefing. Without a vaccine, he said it could take years for the global population to build up sufficient levels of immunity. “I think it’s important to put this on the table,” he said. “This virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities,” like other previously novel diseases such as HIV, which have never disappeared, but for which effective treatments have been developed. It can take three to five days for someone newly infected with the coronavirus to feel sick and some infected people won’t even have symptoms. Since testing is mostly reserved in the US for those with symptoms, it can take two weeks or so — the time for one group of people to spread the virus to another — to have enough testing data to reflect a surge in cases. “If you are doing adequate testing, it will take two to three weeks” to spot an increase, Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute, said Wednesday as he prepared to speak to a congressional subcommittee on the crisis. He urged a dramatic increase in testing. “It was the failure of testing that caused our country to shut down,” Jha said. “We need federal leadership on the level of testing, guidance on whom to test and federal help on the sheer capacity, the number of tests that can be done. We still do not have the testing capacity we need to open up safely.” New coronavirus clusters have surfaced around the world as nations struggle to balance restarting their economies and preventing a second wave of infections. Authorities in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic first began late last year, reportedly are pressing ahead to test all 11 million residents for the virus within 10 days after a handful of new infections were found. In Lebanon, authorities reinstated a nationwide lockdown for four days beginning Wednesday night after a spike in reported infections and complaints that social distancing rules were being ignored. In the US, as in many countries, the lockdowns have resulted in catastrophic levels of job losses. The US unemployment rate soared to 14.7 per cent in April, the highest rate since the Great Depression. There are roughly 30 million Americans out of work. In Washington, US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned Wednesday that a prolonged recession could cause extensive damage to the economy, and urged Congress and the White House to act further to prevent long-lasting damage. The Fed and Congress have already taken immense steps, but Powell warned that numerous bankruptcies among small businesses and extended unemployment for many people remain a serious risk. While costly, more assistance in government spending or tax policies would be “worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery,” he said. Powell spoke a day after Democratic leaders proposed a $3 trillion aid package that would direct money to state and local governments, households, and health-care workers. That would come on top of roughly $3 trillion in earlier financial assistance. The Fed itself has cut interest rates to near zero and created numerous emergency lending programs. But Trump administration officials have said they want to first see how previous aid packages affect the economy, and were skeptical about allowing more spending right now. The tension in balancing people’s safety against severe economic fallout is playing out across the world. Italy partially lifted lockdown restrictions last week only to see a big jump in confirmed coronavirus cases in its hardest-hit region. Pakistan reported 2,000 new infections in a single day after crowds of people crammed into local markets as restrictions were eased. In the United States, the country’s top infectious disease expert issued a blunt warning Tuesday that cities and states could see more Covid-19 deaths and economic damage if they lift stay-at-home orders too quickly. “There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control,” Dr. Anthony Fauci said in Senate testimony. The US has the largest coronavirus outbreak in the world by far: 1.37 million infections and over 82,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 4.2 million people and killed some 292,000, according to the Johns Hopkins tally. Experts say the actual numbers are likely far higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spike-in-covid-19-cases-in-us-could-emerge-weeks-after-states-reopen-say-experts/story-v2K7D6lmD6nBYpT4WCP74O.html

Scientists who led the work, reported on Wednesday, say it shows the need for more research into whether the virus can spread from people to cats to people again. Health experts have downplayed that possibility. The American Veterinary Medical Association said in a new statement that just because an animal can be deliberately infected in a lab “does not mean that it will easily be infected with that same virus under natural conditions.” Anyone concerned about that risk should use “common sense hygiene,” said virus expert Peter Halfmann. Don’t kiss your pets and keep surfaces clean to cut the chances of picking up any virus an animal might shed, he said. He and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine led the lab experiment and published results Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. Federal grants paid for the work. Researchers took coronavirus from a human patient and infected three cats with it. Each cat then was housed with another cat that was free of infection. Within five days, coronavirus was found in all three of the newly exposed animals. None of the six cats ever showed any symptoms. “There was no sneezing, no coughing, they never had a high body temperature or lost any weight,” Halfmann said. “If a pet owner looked at them ... they wouldn’t have noticed anything.” Last month, two domestic cats in different parts of New York state tested positive for the coronavirus after mild respiratory illnesses. They were thought to have picked it up from people in their homes or neighbourhoods. Some tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo also have tested positive for the virus, as have a small number of other animals around the world. Those cases and the new lab experiment show “there is a public health need to recognize and further investigate the potential chain of human-cat-human transmission,” the authors wrote. Guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that based on the limited information available so far, the risk of pets spreading coronavirus to people “is considered to be low.” The veterinary medicine group says “there is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19.” It stressed that person-to-person transmission was driving the global pandemic. However, the group noted that many diseases spread between pets and people, so hygiene is always important: Wash your hands before and after touching pets, and keep your pet and its food and water bowls clean. Halfmann, whose two cats sleep near him, said the worry may be greater for animal shelters, where one infected animal could pass the virus to many others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-kiss-pets-cats-with-no-symptoms-spread-covid-19-to-other-cats-in-lab-test/story-rGjXDbQrGwZhhMsaHNc2jP.html
14-05-2020||World||US report indicates broad risk of Covid-19 at wildfire camps||Outbreaks of the coronavirus could sweep through large camps where crews typically stay as they fight wildfires across the US, according to a federal document obtained by The Associated Press, and the problem is likely to get worse the longer the fire season lasts.The US Forest Service’s draft risk assessment suggests that even in a best-case scenario — with social distancing followed and plenty of tests and protective equipment available — nearly two dozen firefighters could be infected with Covid-19 at a camp with hundreds of people who come in to combat a fire that burns for months.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe worst-case scenario? More than 1,000 infections.“The Forest Service is diligently working with partners to assess the risk that Covid-19 presents for the 2020 fire season,” the agency said in a statement Wednesday. “It is important to understand that the figures in this report are not predictions, but rather, model possible scenarios.”The Forest Service said the document was outdated and being redone, and the newest version wasn’t yet ready to share. The AP obtained the draft from an official who has access to it and didn’t want to be named.One of the authors of the risk assessment said Tuesday that in the new version, the infection rates remain the same. But while the draft originally said the death rate among infected firefighters could reach as high as 6%, that is being revised sharply downward, to less than 2%, to reflect newer data, said Jude Bayham, an assistant professor in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at Colorado State University.He said the initial death rate was based on data from early in the pandemic, when testing was far more limited. Based on new data, firefighters — who are largely healthy and young — will likely fare far better if they contract Covid-19 than the general population, he said.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially people who are older or have health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.Federal guidelines released last week reimagine how to combat wildfires to reduce the risk of firefighters getting the virus. The guidelines urge fire managers to use small crews that can have the close contact that firefighting and travel often require, while staying away from other groups. The guidelines recommend avoiding the traditional large camps and relying on military-issue ready-to-eat or bagged meals instead of catered buffet-style meals at campsites.Some fire managers also are told to take temperatures with their own touchless thermometers if possible. The guidelines say everyone should wear masks and other protective equipment when around those outside their immediate crew. Good cleaning and sanitation is recommended, as is isolating firefighters and potentially entire crews if Covid-19 is detected.A review of incident reports from wildfires so far this year show the guidelines are difficult, and sometimes impossible, to follow and could actually increase some risks to firefighters.“We have developed pinch-points that cause operational lapses in guidance that may very well get confused with policy and doctrine. This situation could result in injury — or even unwanted death — of our multiagency employees,” Greg Juvan, a fire management officer with the Idaho Panhandle National Forests, wrote in a report from a small wildfire last month.Social distancing was difficult, and firefighters found it unrealistic to meet sanitation standards for truck radios, hand tools and other gear used in the initial attack on the Idaho wildfire, Juvan said. Social distancing guidelines call for more vehicles to transport crews, but that led to congestion on the narrow roads leading to the fire. The guidelines could raise one of the greatest risks to wildland firefighters — traffic wrecks, Juvan said.Even something as basic as sanitizing vehicles proved problematic, with cleaning supplies difficult to find, the report said.In New Mexico, several agencies responded to a small wildfire last month, with some not practicing social distancing and other virus policies appearing to vary greatly, George Allalunis, a Carson National Forest engine captain, wrote in a report.For the Forest Service’s draft risk assessment, researchers created scenarios using three actual fires from 2017 and applied disease modeling. They found testing every firefighter before they started work reduced the coronavirus risk most significantly for short, high-intensity wildfires, said Bayham, the professor. But for longer, drawn-out firefights, initial testing was less important than keeping firefighters spread out in small campsites.The models showed that even with strict pre-work testing and social distancing, about 21 Covid-19 infections could be expected in a large camp like that used for a 2017 fire in Montana. In the worst-case scenario, more than 1,000 firefighters would be infected. The problem could compound as fire crews are sent to new locations over the monthslong fire season, which has largely begun.The risk assessment will be updated throughout the season, the Forest Service said.The American West could see higher-than-normal levels of wildfire this year because of drought.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-report-indicates-broad-risk-of-covid-19-at-wildfire-camps/story-ChS2Bsh48IqAK9XzkG5eGJ.html
