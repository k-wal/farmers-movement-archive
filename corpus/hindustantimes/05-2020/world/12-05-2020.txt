The two countries also deliberated upon the challenges posed by the “deep global economic crisis” caused by the Covid-19 pandemic as External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar held his first virtual joint commission with his Danish counterpart Jeppe Kofod and reviewed bilateral ties. This was the third India-Danish Joint Commission Meeting (JCM).The two ministers noted that the pandemic is posing a significant threat to a globally connected world and forcing countries to restrict travel and interaction, a Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) statement said. “Both sides agreed to jointly fight the Covid-19 pandemic by agreeing to share best practices and exchange information on medical research, testing kits and development of vaccines,” the statement said.Jaishankar and Kofod welcomed the dialogue between the Statens Serum Institute in Denmark and the office of the principal scientific adviser in India.They noted that the challenges of a deep global economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic also creates new opportunities for green transition and provide a new sustainable way forward for societies of the two countries creating new jobs and growth, the MEA said.India and Denmark are well placed to take full advantage of such development and show global leadership, it said.Jaishankar said discussions strengthened focus on clean technology, urbanisation, renewable energy, green solutions and food processing.“Did my first virtual Joint Commission today. Couldn’t be with a better counterpart - FM @JeppeKofod of #Denmark,” Jaishankar tweeted. “Would encourage colleagues in other countries to follow suit.” “A productive review of our ties. Strengthened focus on cleantech, urbanisation, renewable energy, green solutions and food processing. And an even stronger political partnership,” he added.The two ministers agreed to work towards establishing a “green strategic partnership” between India and Denmark building on existing green and sustainable collaborations under the Joint Commission, which would focus on areas such as climate change, energy, circular economy, water, sustainable food and agriculture, the MEA said.Close government-to-government cooperation has already been established in water, urban development and animal husbandry and dairy, it said.In renewable energy, a new five-year India-Denmark Energy Partnership can build on the existing strong cooperation, the statement said. Both ministers discussed the growing participation in the International Solar Alliance and Denmark expressed its interest in joining this alliance at the earliest.The ministers reviewed the current state of bilateral relations and noted that the 70th anniversary of bilateral relations in 2019 and the 400-year anniversary of the establishment of the first trading post by Denmark in Tranquebar are being commemorated through various events and programmes. They agreed to hold Foreign Office Consultations during the second half of 2020 to discuss bilateral relations and issues of regional and global importance and a Policy Planning Dialogue to promote sharing on strategic and global trends of mutual interest at a mutually convenient date in the near future.Both sides expressed satisfaction at the progress made in the 8 Joint Working Groups (JWG) - on Renewable Energy, Environment, Agriculture & Animal Husbandry, Food Processing, Labour Mobility, Sustainable and Smart Urban Development, Science & Technology and Shipping. It was also discussed that the recently constituted Joint Working Group on Digitization would meet soon, the MEA said.Both sides also explored the possibility of establishing a Joint Working Group on Health to facilitate closer cooperation between the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors, including institutional collaboration and joint research.The ministers recognised that there is immense potential for further expanding trade and investments, facilitating wider business-to-business contacts, and intensifying trade promotion and ease-of-doing-business activities, the MEA said.They agreed that a focus area could be green technologies promoting innovative solutions in renewable energy and energy efficiency, and both sides emphasized the urgent need to increase and facilitate more activities and linkages in these areas, it said.Both sides discussed the importance of innovative use of online and virtual interaction to ensure continuity of diplomatic and political contacts. Jaishankar and Kofod expressed views on multilateral issues in this context and shared the common position that there is a need to further strengthen multilateralism and work together to ensure those international organizations like the UN and WHO are strengthened and function effectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-denmark-vow-to-jointly-combat-covid-19-share-info-on-testing-kits-and-vaccines/story-6pI5u3PwZ0KDUCuSdRYHsK.html
12-05-2020||World||UK court told how Nirav Modi threatened witnesses||Two videos showing witnesses recounting how they were threatened and passports confiscated allegedly at the behest of daimantaire Nirav Modi and his associates were played in the Westminster Magistrates Court on Tuesday as part of India’s extradition case. Judge Samuel Mark Gozee viewed the videos in which the witnesses narrated in Hindi and English how they were intimidated, insisting that they were not under any duress to make the statements. The videos are part of India’s evidence submitted to the court against Modi.The CBI has earlier filed supplementary chargesheets in an Indian court that Modi threatened to kill one of the directors of his company, Ashish Mohanbhai Lad, if he expressed a desire to return to India from Cairo.According to CBI, Lad had fled from Dubai to Cairo to avoid arrest and in June 2018, when he planned to return to India from Cairo, he was contacted Modi’s behalf by his brother, Nehal Modi, and threatened.The second day of the extradition trial began with Modi’s lawyer, Claire Montgomery, who appeared for businessman Vijay Mallya in his extradition case, set out broadly similar objections to Modi’s extradition.According to her, there is no prima facie case against Modi; he faced risk to his human rights in the Arthur Road jail in Mumbai; and he may not receive a fair trial if extradited. Modi appeared in court via video-link from the Wandsworth jail.Under the UK-India extradition treaty, the country requesting the extradition needs to establish in the requested country’s court that there is a prima facie case against the person – not a conviction – based on charges that would amount to offences in law in both countries.Montgomery blamed “incompetence” of the Punjab National Bank for the way in which credit and loans were extended to Modi and his companies. She quoted extensively from bank documents from 2004, and at one stage accused PNB of misleading the Reserve Bank of India on lending.Raising objections to documents submitted by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) lawyer Helen Malcolm, Montgomery claimed that many are inadmissible in court, she told judge Samuel Mark Goozee. There is “no underlying evidence” in India’s case, she added.She said the witness statements submitted by India had the same ‘defect’ as in the Mallya case: that they were ‘copy and paste’ examples, which raised doubts about their provenance and the ways in which theyw re secured under Section 161 of India’s Code of Criminal Procedure.The sovereign assurance given by the ministry of home affairs that Modi’s human rights would be protected in the Mumbai jail, she said, is “inadequate”, raising concerns about over-crowding, conditions, availability of medical facilities, and reminding the court that Modi faced “serious mental health issues.”Modi is now the subject of two extradition requests; one processed by the CBI and the other by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The CBI case relates to large-scale fraud upon PNB, through the fraudulent obtaining of Letters of Understanding (LOUs/loan agreements); the ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.The additional offences relate to allegations that Modi interfered with the CBI investigation by “causing disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses (”criminal intimidation to cause death”). They have not been joined to the CBI case, but will be dealt with at a separate later hearing likely in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-court-told-how-nirav-modi-threatened-witnesses/story-2XqmEULL6pK5U3rPOfTUfO.html
12-05-2020||World||4 newborns among 16 dead in Kabul hospital attack; 24 killed in funeral bombing||Gunmen disguised as police attacked a hospital in the Afghan capital, Kabul, on Tuesday, killing 16 people including two newborn babies from a maternity clinic run by the international humanitarian organisation Doctors Without Borders.In a separate attack the same day, a suicide bomber struck the funeral of a police commander, attended by government officials and a member of parliament, in the eastern province of Nangahar, killing at least 24 people and injuring 68. Authorities said that toll could rise.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either attack. The Taliban, Afghanistan’s main Islamist insurgency group which says it has halted attacks on cities under a U.S. troop withdrawal deal, denied involvement in both.The Islamic State militant group operates in Nangahar and has carried out a number of high-profile attacks in Kabul in recent months. On Monday security forces arrested its regional leader in the capital.The violence, as the country battles the coronavirus pandemic, risks derailing momentum towards U.S.-brokered peace talks between the Taliban and an Afghan government long sceptical of the insurgents’ renunciation of attacks.“If the Taliban cannot control the violence, or their sponsors have now subcontracted their terror to other entities —which was one of our primary concerns from the beginning — then there seems little point in continuing to engage Taliban in ‘peace talks,” tweeted Hamdullah Mohib, the government’s national security advisor.MOTHERS, CHILDREN, NURSESThe Kabul attack began in the morning when at least three gunmen wearing police uniforms entered the Dasht-e-Barchi hospital, throwing grenades and shooting, government officials said. Security forces had killed the attackers by the afternoon.“The attackers were shooting at anyone in this hospital without any reason. It’s a government hospital, and a lot of people bring in their women and children for treatment,” said Ramazan Ali, a vendor nearby who saw the start of the attack.The 100-bed government-run hospital hosted a maternity clinic run by Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French name Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).MSF confirmed in a tweet that the hospital had been attacked. Just hours before it had tweeted a photo of a newborn at the clinic in his mother’s arms after being delivered safely by emergency caesarean section.Interior and health ministry officials said that mothers, nurses and children were among the dead and wounded.Photos from the Ministry of Interior showed two young children lying dead inside the hospital. Soldiers ferried infants out of the compound, some wrapped in blood-stained blankets. Officials said 100 people in total were rescued, including three foreign nationals.The neighbourhood is home to many members of Afghanistan’s Hazara community, a mostly Shia Muslim minority that has been attacked by Sunni militants from Islamic State in the past, including at a Kabul ceremony commemorating the death of one of its leaders in March.Rights group Amnesty International condemned both attacks.“The unconscionable war crimes in Afghanistan today, targeting a maternity hospital and a funeral, must awaken the world to the horrors civilians continue to face,” the group tweeted. “There must be accountability for these grave crimes.”Foreign powers including the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey and Pakistan released statements condemning the violence.Last week, security forces killed and arrested several members of an Islamic State cell that authorities said was responsible for several attacks in Kabul including one on a Sikh temple in March. A roadside blast in the capital on Monday, which wounded four civilians, was claimed by the group.Afghanistan is also facing violence around the country from the Taliban, even as the United States tries to usher in peace talks after signing a troop withdrawal agreement in February with the militants. The Taliban say they are holding back from attacking urban centres and their operations are aimed at government security forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-newborns-among-16-dead-in-kabul-hospital-attack-24-killed-in-funeral-bombing/story-idO6xpHy2XM88uCgR1xYyN.html

A small, poorly armed separatist group has been battling for independence since then.___Corrects that Lin was from Maryland, not Ohio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-pilot-dies-in-plane-crash-in-indonesia/story-4OFSiaXPdLuDMXHiqYtfaP.html

This will not only result in needless suffering and death, but would actually set us back on our quest to return to normal.”Fauci’s “checkpoints” are conditions laid down in guidelines for reopening prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for undoing the lockdown in phases, with clear markers for moving from one phase to the next. The White House has blocked its release.Asked specifically about his NYT remarks at the hearing, Fauci made the same argument but in different words. The “consequences could be really serious”, he said and added later that premature reopening could lead to “little spikes that might turn into outbreaks”.The immunologist testified remotely through video, along with two other top officials of the president’s task force, Stephen Kahn and Robert Redfield, who are all in self-quarantine after possible exposure to the virus.Fauci’s warning to the lawmakers came at a time when US fatalities have crossed another bleak milestone to rise to 80,684, accounting for every third death worldwide; infections rose to 1.34 million.President Donald Trump is eager to reopen the country with an eye on his re-election prospects later in the year and has called for it repeatedly, while at the same time, leaving the final decision to state governor. He has backed protests against the lockdown and publicly criticized states that are being cautious.A widely respected research model, which has been cited the White House coronavirus task force members often, has doubled its forecast to more than 134,000 deaths at the current speed and nature of the reopening. Trump has insisted the model does not take into account social-distancing.But the president himself doesn’t observe these social distancing guidelines and has continued to not use a mask or a face covering during his meetings and engagements, even as he was instructed all White House staff to it, in the aftermath of two White House personnel testing positive.“If they’re a certain distance from me or if they’re a certain distance from each other, they do,” he told reporters at a White House news briefing when asked. “In the case of me, I’m not -- I’m not close to anybody.”The president walked out of the briefing shortly, after heated exchanges with two female reporters. He had asked a Chinese American reporter to check with China in response to an unrelated question, which he went on to call “nasty”. He had then denied another reporter a chance to ask her questions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-serious-consequences-of-premature-reopening-of-us-warns-white-house-scientist-fauci/story-skjCam0SFT9XKj9gvTr7BK.html

I’m being treated.”Peskov, 52, has been Putin’s spokesman since 2008, but started working him with in the early 2000s.Russians who have the virus but light or no symptoms of illness are allowed to stay home, and it wasn’t immediately clear if Peskov’s hospitalization reflects the gravity of his condition or was an extra precaution.Reporters from the Kremlin pool said on Twitter that Peskov was last seen in public on April 30 “at a meeting with Vladimir Putin.” It was not clear whether it means the two were in the same room, as Putin has been conducting all his meetings via teleconference in recent weeks.Since early in the outbreak, the Russian president minimized meetings and switched to holding daily video calls with Cabinet members and aides.Peskov’s announcement comes just a day after Putin said Russia was successful in slowing down infections and announced easing some of the nationwide lockdown restrictions.Russia has reported more than 232,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 2,100 virus-related deaths, as of Tuesday. Hours before Putin made televised remarks Monday about ending the country’s partial economic lockdown, health officials reported a daily record of over 11,600 new cases.Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin revealed on April 30 that he had tested positive for the virus and planned to self-isolate. Putin asked the prime minister to call him after checking into a hospital.Mishustin’s spokesperson said Monday that the prime minister “continues to undergo treatment in one of the state-run medical facilities” and his health was improving, but gave no details about the severity of his condition.___Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-president-vladimir-putin-s-spokesman-hospitalised-with-coronavirus/story-TrGAv3gi3rZ2FVW56wm0iP.html

That is why we have helped accelerate this from the start and are proud to be home to two of the world’s most promising vaccine development programmes at Oxford University and Imperial College, supported by a globally renowned pharmaceutical sector”.“But while we hope for a breakthrough, hope is not a plan. A mass vaccine or treatment may be more than a year away. Indeed, in a worst-case scenario, we may never find a vaccine. So our plan must countenance a situation where we are in this, together, for the long haul, even while doing all we can to avoid that outcome”.According to the Office for National Statistics, which registers deaths on the basis of death certificates issued and the causes mentioned in it, there were 35,044 deaths in England and Wales up to May 9.Adding the latest figures for Scotland and Northern Ireland in hospital settings, the total official UK death toll now stands at 40,011, making it the worst-affected country in Europe.

The scope of the investigation should include permanent residents and floating population in the jurisdiction”.Among the first to be tested are the 5,000 are residents in and around Sanmin residential community, where the cluster was discovered, and another 14,000 from the nearby market named Duoluokou.The new cluster case has triggered a fear of a resurgence of Covid-19 cases in the city, which was lifting restrictions in a staggered way in the past one month.Meanwhile, a laundry worker in northeast China’s Jilin province is likely to have infected a dozen others with the coronavirus after she was infected by contaminated clothes during her work, experts have told Chinese state media.According to the tabloid, Global Times, the 45-year-old woman is said to have worked at a laundry service for a local public security bureau in Shulan city where officers had close contact with visitors from Russia between April 8 and 30. The virus has now spread from the woman to her husband, three sisters, other family members and close contacts of those confirmed cases, according to the local health authority.The city of around 630000 people have been put under a partial lockdown since Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-on-10-day-battle-to-test-all-for-covid-19-after-cluster-infection/story-GaUc02JY89aDTUqmNehXdI.html

Afghan forces carried out newborn babies and their mothers as they evacuated the hospital, and at least four people were reported wounded.Elsewhere in Afghanistan, a suicide bomber targeted a funeral in eastern Nangarhar province — a hotbed of the Islamic State group — on Tuesday, killing 10 people and wounding at least 30.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the Kabul attack but both the Taliban and the IS are active in the Afghan capital and its surroundings, and both frequently target the military and security forces, as well as civilians. The Taliban later denied they were involved.In Kabul, black smoke rose into the sky over the hospital in the city’s Dashti Barchi, a mostly Shiite neighborhood that has been the site of many past attacks by Islamic State militants. Interior Ministry spokesman Tareq Arian said that over 80 women and babies were evacuated by Afghan security forces as the firefight got underway.Photos shared by the ministry show newborn babies and their mothers being carried out of the hospital. “The forces are trying to eliminate the terrorists and bring the situation under control,” said Arian. He later added that at least one of the attackers was shot dead.Wahid Majroh, deputy public health minister, rushed to the site from where he said at least four people were wounded. It was unclear why the hospital in Dashti Barchi, a 100-bed facility, was targeted.In the attack in the eastern Nangarhar province, Attahullah Khogyani, spokesman for the provincial governor, said the suicide bomber targeted a funeral ceremony in Khewa district for a local pro-government militia commander who had died of a heart attack on Monday night.The bomber struck as mourners had gathered, killing at least 10 and wounding 30, Khogyani said.Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid later tweeted that the Taliban were not involved in either the Kabul or the Nangarhar attack.The IS, meanwhile, claimed it was behind a spate of attacks on Monday in Kabul when four bombs, one placed under a garbage bin and the other three by the roadside, went off in the northern part of the city, wounding four civilians, including a child.The Afghan intelligence service said in a statement later Monday that the agency has arrested an IS leader in the region, Zia-ul Haq, also known as Shaikh Abu Omer Al-Khorasani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-gunmen-storm-maternity-clinic-in-shiite-area-of-kabul/story-YGL9978MPoRxDj295H3ubN.html

It says this can be accomplished by merging ad hoc relief allowances from 2016-2019 into the basic pay designated in 2017. “Thereafter, allowing increase in pay @20% of revised pay scales in financial year 2020-21.”Last year the military “voluntarily agreed” to cut its expenditures due to the “critical financial situation” facing the country, and skipped a routine increase in the annual defence budget.

Modi appeared in court via video-link from the Wandsworth jail.According to her, the “incompetence” of the Punjab National Bank was responsible for the ways in which credit and loans were extended to Modi and his companies. She quoted extensively from bank documents from 2004, and at one stage accused PNB of misleading the Reserve Bank of India on lending.Raising objections to documents submitted by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) lawyer Helen Malcolm, Montgomery claimed that many are inadmissible in court, she told judge Samuel Mark Goozee. There is “no underlying evidence” in India’s case, she added.The sovereign assurance given by the ministry of home affairs that Modi’s human rights would be protected in the Mumbai jail, she said, is “inadequate”, raising concerns about over-crowding, conditions, availability of medical facilities, and reminding the court that Modi faced “serious mental health issues.”Malcolm told the court on Monday that loans and credit were obtained by Modi and his companies fraudulently and when the fraud was discovered, Modi allegedly began a campaign to intimidate witnesses. Mobile phones and a server were destroyed, she said.Malcolm named bank officials and cited documents to recount Modi’s alleged laundering of money and transfer of funds through accounts of members of his family, entities and properties in various countries, including in the United States.According to the CBI, Modi, brother Nehal Modi and two business associates tried to threaten witnesses and destroy evidence, which came to light after nine employees submitted details of how Modi and others took them to Cairo against their will, offered bribes and threatened them.Modi’s defence team is due to present witnesses, including expert on prisons Alan Mitchell, who also appeared in the Mallya case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-prima-facie-case-against-nirav-modi-claims-lawyer/story-CKD7G88S7jCFVRf3ASa2jN.html
12-05-2020||World||UK man held for racist abuse of Indian-origin journalist||The Leicestershire police on Tuesday charged a man who hurled racist abuse at an Indian-origin journalist as she prepared for a live broadcast after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced new lockdown plans on television on Sunday evening.BBC’s Sima Kotecha, who was preparing for the broadcast from the Leicester city centre, called it off after the abuse.She tweeted: “Apologies to our guests who we had to send home without putting on air after myself and team were subjected to racist and abusive behavior – sad obstruction of reporting of a national crisis. Yes I’m furious”.The police said Russel Rawlingson, 50, has been charged with “using threatening/abusive/insulting words/behaviour to cause harassment/alarm/distress following an incident in which a television crew were verbally abused in Leicester city centre on Sunday”.Leicester in the east Midlands has a large population of Indian origin, many of whom settled there after being expelled from Uganda in the early 1970s. They and successive generations have rejuvenated local economy and hold senior roles in various walks of life.A BBC spokesman added: “While preparing to broadcast, our reporter, her production team and guests were subjected to racist and abusive behaviour. We will not tolerate racism or abuse of our staff.”Under UK lockdown rules, journalists are categorised as ‘essential workers’ and are able to move around in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-man-held-for-racist-abuse-of-indian-origin-journalist/story-gdnCtuXQrJK6Q4DRQjrshL.html
12-05-2020||World||China calls for coronavirus vigilance, warns against complacency||Chinese health authorities called on Tuesday called for vigilance to be maintained against the novel coronavirus as new clusters emerge, even though the peak of the epidemic has passed in the country where it first appeared.In the past two weeks, new cases have been reported in seven provinces, including Hubei, the original epicentre of the outbreak late last year.On Monday, Wuhan, capital of Hubei, reported its first cluster of infections since a lockdown on the city was lifted a month ago.The reappearance of clusters suggested that counter-epidemic measures could not be relaxed, Mi Feng, spokesman at the National Health Commission, told a media briefing. While prevention and control efforts had normalised, that did not mean measures could be eased, Mi said.As of Monday, mainland China had 115 current confirmed cases, while 5,470 people were under medical observation for signs of novel coronavirus infection.A major worry is asymptomatic cases - people who show no clinical signs of infection but spread the virus. The number of such cases is not known as they only appear on the radar of health authorities when they show up in tests.In Beijing, where just 13 cases are still being treated, health authorities also warned against complacency. “Even after the 13 patients have recovered and have been discharged from hospital, that does not mean there is zero risk afterwards,” Lei Haichao, head of the Beijing Health Commission, told a media briefing.Beijing was among the few places in China that upheld strict rules on screening, testing and quarantine. It even stopped all international flights from landing in the city directly.But now China has to strike a balance between maintaining a degree of public health control and easing restrictions where it is deemed safe to do so and returning society and the economy to some state of normalcy. “The sealing of the city was once an extremely effective method for us in dealing with the epidemic, but now we need to find a balance between economic recovery and epidemic prevention and control,” Lei said. The government has allowed cinemas, museums and other recreational venues across the country to gradually reopen, a move welcome by a virus-hit services sector.But performance venues must keep their operating capacity at no more than 30%, the China Culture Administration Association said.The operating capacity of internet bars and entertainment venues should be capped at less than 50%, it said.Shanghai Disneyland reopened on Monday for the first time in three months, but restricted daily visitor numbers to 20% of capacity.

12-05-2020||World||UK’s Covid-19 death toll tops 38,000, worst in Europe||The United Kingdom’s COVID-19 death toll topped 38,000 as of early May, by far the worst yet reported in Europe, raising questions about Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s handling of the coronavirus crisis.Figures published by the Office for National Statistics for England and Wales brought the United Kingdom’s official death toll to 38,289 as of May 3 -- up nearly 6,000 in the space of a week, according to a Reuters tally of death registrations data.While different ways of counting make comparisons with other countries difficult, the figure confirmed Britain was among those hit worst by a pandemic that has killed more than 285,000 worldwide.The data came a day after Johnson set out a gradual plan to get Britain back to work, including advice on wearing home-made face coverings -- though his attempt to lift the coronavirus lockdown prompted confusion.Such a high UK death toll increases the pressure on Johnson: opposition parties say he was too slow to impose a lockdown, too slow to introduce mass testing and too slow to get enough protective equipment to hospitals.The data painted a grim picture in care homes, which have been especially hard hit by the virus.“Care homes (are) showing the slowest decline, sadly,” ONS statistician Nick Stripe told BBC TV.“For the first time that I can remember, there were more deaths in total in care homes than there were in hospitals in that week.”The figures showed care homes now account for a third of all COVID-19 deaths in England and Wales.A Reuters Special Report published last week showed care homes bore the brunt of policy designed to shield its hospitals from COVID-19, leaving many of the weakest exposed.SICK MAN OF EUROPE?Unlike the daily death toll announced by the government, Tuesday’s figures include suspected deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.Ministers dislike comparisons of the headline death toll because Britain’s performance in part reflects the fact it has been quicker to publish comprehensive data on COVID-19 deaths than other European countries.They say excess mortality - the number of deaths from all causes that exceed the average for the time of year - is more meaningful because it is internationally comparable.Early evidence, though, suggests Britain is faring badly on that front too.So far this year, there have been more than 50,000 excess deaths compared to five-year average, ONS statistician Stripe said.The ONS said deaths from all causes decreased for a second week running as of May 1, but 8,012 more people than average died in the 18th week of 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-covid-19-death-toll-tops-38-000-worst-in-europe/story-VWN3YIPLOi1NHKwAChFSiJ.html

12-05-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine ‘only solution’, but may never be found, warns UK PM Johnson||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that a mass vaccine for the novel coronavirus may be over a year away and, in the worst-case scenario, may in fact never be found.In his foreword to the government’s new 50-page guidance on a step by step easing of the lockdown measures in place to control the spread of the deadly virus, the UK prime minister lays out plans for businesses to gradually start reopening with “COVID-19 Secure” measures of social distancing and for the public to use “good solid British common sense” as the economy is unlocked.“A mass vaccine or treatment may be more than a year away,” said Johnson, highlighting the work being done in the UK by scientists at Oxford University and Imperial College London towards this mission.“Indeed, in a worst-case scenario, we may never find a vaccine. So our plan must countenance a situation where we are in this, together, for the long haul, even while doing all we can to avoid that outcome,” he said.Admitting that a vaccine or drug-based treatment is the only “feasible long-term solution”, he said the UK has accelerated this with “promising” vaccine development programmes and a collaboration between Oxford University and pharma major AstraZeneca was a vital step that could help rapidly advance the manufacture of a Covid-19 vaccine when it is ready.As part of global efforts, he flagged the GBP 388 million in aid funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatment, including GBP 250m to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.“But while we hope for a breakthrough, hope is not a plan,” he said, as he unveiled his plan for starting to lift lockdown restrictions from this week in phases.Following a televised address to the nation on Sunday night and a statement in Parliament on Monday, the guidance comes into effect in public life across England from Wednesday when people will be allowed one-to-one contact with people other than those they live with, as long as they remain outside and two metres apart. They are allowed to play sport with a friend or family member from outside their household or socialise with them in the open air for the first time in more than six weeks since the lockdown was imposed.People are still advised to work from home where possible but start heading into work where necessary, in sectors such as construction and manufacturing, keeping the social distancing norms in place.Under the step by step plan, by the start of next month non-essential shops will also reopen, with some hairdressers, pubs and cinemas to follow from July. However, as part of a Covid-19 Alert System, if infection rates are seen to be rising again, restrictions would be tightened “possibly at short notice”.Fines for breaching the new rules will also be increased to GBP 100 and will double for each repeat offence, up to a maximum of GBP 3,200.Johnson said: “I must ask the country to be patient with a continued disruption to our normal way of life, but to be relentless in pursuing our mission to build the systems we need. The worst possible outcome would be a return to the virus being out of control – with the cost to human life, and – through the inevitable re-imposition of severe restrictions – the cost to the economy. We must stay alert, control the virus, and in doing so, save lives.“Then, as vaccines and treatment become available, we will move to another new phase, where we will learn to live with Covid-19 for the longer term without it dominating our lives.” The devolved administrations of Scotland and Wales are putting their own measures in place and keeping the “stay at home” message in place, rather than switch to the new “stay alert” message.The UK government’s latest messaging has come under attack from the Opposition and other sections of society over a feared lack of clarity for the general public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-only-solution-but-may-never-be-found-warns-uk-pm-johnson/story-GnM5oHPadC5lHntOSm2E8I.html
12-05-2020||World||Wuhan to test whole city of 11 million after new cases emerge||Wuhan, where the global coronavirus epidemic first started, has ordered officials to prepare to test its entire 11 million population after the central Chinese city reported a handful of new infections for the first time since its lockdown was lifted, according to state media reports.All districts in the city have been told to submit a plan which should lay out how they will prepare within ten days to conduct testing of everyone under their purview, said a document cited by local media reports as being released by Wuhan’s anti-virus department. The plan should prioritize the testing of vulnerable groups and areas like residential compounds, the document said.Six locally transmitted cases, reported on May 10 and 11, were found in people already under quarantine who were asymptomatic before testing positive, according to the local government. All six cases emerged from a single residential compound and were the first new infections found in Wuhan since its lockdown was lifted on April 8.The ambitious move to test everyone in Wuhan reflects China’s anxiety over a resurgence of the epidemic, which it managed to stamp out through draconian restrictions that locked down hundreds of millions of people at its peak in February. Wuhan was sealed off from Jan. 23 until April 8 in a months-long ordeal that saw scores die as the local health system collapsed.Even as its people cautiously return to normal life, the city has come under the global spotlight again after U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration charged that the virus is linked to a laboratory in the Wuhan Institute of Virology. China has denied any link and the laboratory’s director said that no staff have been infected, which he said disproves the theory.Although the new cases in Wuhan are few and appear under control, they serve as a reminder of the risk China faces as it tries to reopen an economy that has seen its worst contraction since 1992.“Seven provinces reported new infections over the past 14 days, and clustered cases were continuing to increase,” Mi Feng, spokesman for the National Health Commission, said on Monday. China reported only one confirmed case on Tuesday, with no new infections in Wuhan.Fears of resurgence in other parts of China were highlighted on Sunday when the northeastern city of Shulan, which borders North Korea, was partially locked down after 11 new infections were discovered. Many cities in China still don’t allow cinemas and bars to operate, and heavy restrictions against social gatherings remain in place. Face masks are required for public transport and entering stores and public facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-to-test-whole-city-of-11-million-after-new-cases-emerge/story-0UnfbTPDwWltK2DobzoLsI.html

The attacker detonated his explosives in the middle of the ceremony, said Ataullah Khogyani, spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar province.“Initial information shows about 40 people killed and wounded in the attack,” he added.The attack targeted the funeral ceremony for a local police commander, according to Khogyani.Battle-weary Nangarhar near the Pakistan border has long been a stronghold for both Islamic State and Taliban militants and has witnessed some of the hardest fighting in recent years. Both international forces and the Taliban in the area have targeted IS fighters, who have largely been pushed out of the province but still retain the ability to launch attacks on urban centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suicide-blast-at-afghan-funeral-kills-several-govt/story-Us3xZ5bMxptEk0hNug2hSL.html

The figure eased slightly to 562,300 tons Tuesday.China is recovering from the slump in February, when much of the domestic economy was shut to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Factories and companies are now back to work, but restrictions to contain the outbreak in other countries have weighed on export orders and disrupted supply chains. Meanwhile, more than 100 meteorological observatory stations across the nation tested record high temperatures in early May.“Bulls are coming back to the thermal coal contracts as demand finally shows some strength after factories and businesses resumed operations,” Wang Miao, an analyst with Huatai Futures, said by phone. “Although there are still uncertainties ahead, such as the extent of the virus impact on overseas orders, market sentiment has markedly improved.”Futures on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange last week climbed back above 500 yuan a ton ($70.56), the floor price of a government-preferred range deemed a good balance for both miners and power generators. Prices sank to 479.8 yuan on April 14, the lowest since Aug. 2016, after record high domestic output in March, followed by a surge in imports, outpaced the recovery in demand.On Tuesday, futures ended 1.7% higher at 518.6 yuan a ton, highest since March 27.The nation’s electricity output shrank 4.6% in March, narrowing the record 8.2% slump in the first two months. The China Electricity Council expects power consumption to grow as much as 3% this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coal-burned-by-china-power-plants-jumps-on-heat-virus-recovery/story-Szr5vCP55zQ71dZgoslQmO.html

The quarantine order can be extended jointly with possible state of emergency extensions. Spain has so far extended its restrictions four times since mid-March.The measures applied to all travellers, including Spanish citizens returning to the country. Only truck drivers, airplane and ship crews, cross-border workers and health staff who are entering Spain to work are exempt from the quarantine.Spain is one of the worst-hit countries by the pandemic with more than 26,000 fatalities recorded and more than 220,000 diagnosed cases.

Out of these, Punjab recorded 11,568 cases, Sindh 12,017, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 4,875, Balochistan 2,017, Islamabad 679, Gilgit-Baltistan 442 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 86 patients.A total of 28 more people died in the last 24 hours in the country (between Sunday and Monday), taking the tally of Covid-19 deaths in Pakistan to 667. Another 8,212 recovered so far.But Pakistan began to lift its lockdown despite a surge in the number of Covid-19 positive ptients.On Monday, Prime Minister Khan chaired a meeting on the crisis where he was briefed about the latest efforts to control the spread of the disease in the wake of easing lockdown.According to an official statement, Khan said that “lockdown is being eased in a phased manner according to the situation and to keep a balance between business and health needs”.Public transport remains shut, but factories and offices have been allowed to resume operations. Restrictions on mosque attendance had already been lifted.Khan, however, asked people to take precautions so that the virus doesn’t run out of control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-drugmakers-warn-against-banning-raw-material-from-india-say-it-will-weaken-covid-19-fight/story-WD8mdbbx3fMYoR5vv9GeOK.html

12-05-2020||World||Workplace worries mount as US tracks new Covid-19 cases||Even as President Donald Trump urges getting people back to work and reopening the economy, thousands of new coronavirus infections are being reported daily, many of them job-related.Recent figures show a surge of cases in meat-packing and poultry-processing plants. There’s been a spike of new infections among construction workers in Austin, Texas, where that sector recently returned to work. Even the White House has proven vulnerable, with positive coronavirus tests for one of Trump’s valets and for Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe developments underscore the high stakes for communities nationwide as they gradually loosen restrictions on business.“The people who are getting sick right now are generally people who are working,” Dr. Mark Escott, a regional health official, told Austin’s city council. “That risk is going to increase the more people are working.”Austin’s concerns will likely be mirrored in communities nationwide as the reopening of stores and factories creates new opportunities for the virus to spread.To be sure, there are plenty of new infections outside the workplace — in nursing homes, and among retired and unemployed people, particularly in densely populated places such as New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia and urban parts of New Jersey and Massachusetts.Yet of the 15 U.S. counties with the highest per-capita infection rates between April 28 and May 5, all are homes to meatpacking and poultry-processing plants or state prisons, according to data compiled by The Associated Press.The county with the highest per-capita rate was Tennessee’s Trousdale County, where nearly 1,300 inmates and 50 staffers recently tested positive at the privately run Trousdale Turner Correctional Center.In the federal prison system, the number of positive cases has increased steadily. As of May 5, there were 2,066 inmates who’d tested positive, up from 730 on April 25.The No. 2 county on AP’s list is Nobles County in Minnesota, which now has about 1,100 cases, compared to two in mid-April. The county seat, Worthington, is home to a JBS pork processing plant that employs hundreds of immigrants.“One guy said to me, ‘I risked my life coming here. I never thought something that I can’t see could take me out,’” said the Rev. Jim Callahan of St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Worthington.Nebraska’s Dakota County, home to a Tyson Foods meat plant, had recorded three cases as of April 15, and now has more than 1,000. There have been at least three Covid-19 deaths, including a Muslim woman from Ethiopia who was among 4,300 employees at the Tyson plant.“These are sad and dangerous days,” the imam of a regional Islamic center, Ahmad Mohammad, told the Siouxland News.In northern Indiana’s Cass County, home to a large Tyson pork-processing plant, confirmed coronavirus cases have surpassed 1,500. That’s given the county — home to about 38,000 residents — one of the nation’s highest per-capita infection rates.The Tyson plant in Logansport, Indiana, was closed April 25 after nearly 900 employees tested positive; it resumed limited operations Thursday after undergoing deep cleaning and installation of Plexiglas workstation barriers. Company spokeswoman Hli Yang said none of the 2,200 workers would return to work without being tested.Also hard hit by recent infections are counties in Virginia, Delaware and Georgia where poultry-processing plants are located.In New York, the hardest-hit state during most of the pandemic, a new survey suggests that factors other than the workplace were involved in many recent cases.The survey of 1,269 patients admitted to 113 hospitals over three recent days confounded expectations that new cases would be dominated by essential workers, especially those traveling on subways and buses. Instead, retirees accounted for 37% of the people hospitalized; 46% were unemployed.“We were thinking that maybe we were going to find a higher percentage of essential employees who were getting sick because they were going to work, that these may be nurses, doctors, transit workers. That’s not the case,” said Gov. Andrew Cuomo.In Pennsylvania, of 2,578 new cases between May 4 and May 6, more than 40% were people living in long-term care facilities. Health officials in Pittsburgh’s Allegheny County said of the 352 new cases between April 20 and May 5, 35% were residents in long-term care facilities and 14% were health care workers.Though the elderly continue to account for a disproportionate share of Covid-19 cases, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the age ratio is changing. In January-February, 76% of cases involved people 50 or older. Since March, only about half the cases are of that age range,Many health workers were among the earliest Americans to test positive. They continue to be infected in large numbers.Gerard Brogan, director of nursing practice for the California Nurses Association, says as many as 200 nurses a day tested positive in California recently. Nationwide, he says the National Nurses United had tallied more than 28,000 positive tests and more than 230 deaths among health workers.Among those recently testing positive was Dr. Pramila Kolisetty of Scarsdale, New York, who has a rehab and pain management practice in the Bronx and is married to a urologist.Even after New York imposed an extensive lockdown, she went to her office two to three times a week while trying to transition to telemedicine.“It took time for us to get ourselves organized,” she said. “We can’t just close the office and say, that’s it.”Some of her staff fell sick with Covid-19, and she started feeling symptoms a few weeks ago. After testing positive, she isolated at home and is now practicing telemedicine.Cuomo, the New York governor, said individual decisions could help slow the pace of new infections.“Much of this comes down to what you do to protect yourself,” Cuomo said at a recent briefing. “Everything is closed down, the government has done everything it could. ... Now it’s up to you. Are you wearing a mask, are you doing the hand sanitizer?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/workplace-worries-mount-as-us-tracks-new-covid-19-cases/story-eNVnWE65r8u6nOKJ2mmviP.html
12-05-2020||World||US says China hacking Covid-19 vaccine research: Reports||The United States has said that hackers tied to the Chinese government are trying to steal the research on developing a vaccine against coronacvirus disease Covid-19.According to reports in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security are planning to release a warning about the Chinese hacking.The hackers are also targeting information and intellectual property on treatments and testing for Covid-19, the reports further said.But the Chinese officials have rejected these allegations. “We are leading the world in Covid-19 treatment and vaccine research. It is immoral to target China with rumours and slanders in the absence of any evidence,” Chinese foreign affairs ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said.Last week in a joint message Britain and the United States warned of a rise in cyber attacks against health professionals involved in the coronavirus response by organised criminals “often linked with other state actors.”Days ago, China had issued a lengthy rebuttal of what it said were 24 “preposterous allegations” by some leading US politicians over its handling of the new coronavirus outbreak.A 30-page, 11,000-word article posted on the ministry website on Saturday night repeated and expanded on the refutations made during the press briefings.Another foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said that the US accused China of not informing them about the pandemic on time, and of not doing enough but “we’ve repeatedly stated our position on these. However, since the US kept repeating these lies, we must strive to help the world see the truth through facts time and again.”The spokesperson further sharpened the attack on the US, saying it did not act fast enough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-china-hacking-covid-19-vaccine-research-reports/story-EmCG3oDulhPNZP4YurV2nI.html

It’s based on the ability in this friendship to nevertheless disagree.”Peters said he did not think the issue would harm diplomatic ties with China, which is New Zealand’s biggest trading partner.Taiwan has reported only 440 coronavirus cases and seven related deaths, relatively low figures attributed to early and effective disease prevention and control work.Peters praised Taiwan’s response to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and said there was a lot for other countries to learn from.“New Zealand’s position on Taiwan is about its tremendous success against COVID-19,” Peters said.When asked about China’s response later in the day, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said New Zealand’s position on Taiwan was only related to its health response to COVID-19.“We have always taken a ‘One China’ policy, and that continues to be the case,” Ardern said.Ties between neighbouring Australia and China have frayed in recent months after Canberra called for an international investigation into the origins and spread of the coronavirus that was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.China has dismissed such a probe as groundless, saying the country has been open and transparent about the outbreak.(Reporting by Praveen Menon; Editing by Christopher Cushing)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-sticks-with-support-for-taiwan-at-who-despite-chinese-rebuke/story-CDlQRPNM63YNnUj1vPe0DI.html
12-05-2020||World||Pakistan ahead of others, says Qureshi as Opposition attacks govt over Covid-19||As the number of coronavirus disease cases rise in Pakistan, Opposition parties slammed the Imran Khan government for mishandling the crisis. The Opposition questioned the government’s move to ease lockdown.The criticism was led by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader and former defence minister Khawaja Asif in the National Assembly.“The current situation that we are in is due to the approximately two months-long negligence showed by the government. When we had fewer deaths, the entire country was completely shut down. Now that we are seeing a dangerous spike in cases, they are easing lockdown restrictions,” he said on Monday.The National Assembly convened after a gap of nearly two months due to the coronavirus pandemic. Speaker Asad Qaiser is among those who contracted the virus and is under recovery.“Two weeks ago, we were told that our testing capacity will be increased to 50,000. But now we are being told that it is only 20,000,” said Asif.Pakistan People’s Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said that the federal government was impeding efforts of the Sindh government to address the coronavirus crisis. He said that an ordinance prepared by the provincial government was not allowed by the governor.Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi defended the government’s handling of the pandemic, saying the situation of Covid-19 in Pakistan was different as compared to Europe and the United States.“Our death and infection rate is 2.17 per cent. Across the world this percentage is 6.8. So we have been largely spared from the larger consequences of this pandemic,” he said.Qureshi also claimed that Pakistan was ahead of other South Asian countries in handling the coronavirus crisis.Minister of Economic Affairs Hammad Azhar said hunger was as much a threat to Pakistan as the coronavirus itself. “Ours is not a western developed country where people can sit home and eat. We have to balance hunger and poverty with the virus,” he said in the National Assembly.He said that if the government continued with the lockdown, 20 million people would go below the poverty line.The number of Covid-19 cases jumped to 31,684 in Pakistan. Out of these, Punjab registered 11,568 cases, Sindh 12,017, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 4,875, Balochistan 2,017, Islamabad 679, Gilgit-Baltistan 442 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 86 patients.A total of 28 more people have died in the last 24 hours, taking the tally of Covid-19 deaths in Pakistan to 667. Another 8,212 recovered so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-ahead-of-others-says-qureshi-as-opposition-attacks-govt-over-covid-19/story-u3uTmuE4U7gsCCTsMtjVEP.html

It also quoted the governor of Khuzestan province, where the county is located, as saying there had been a sharp rise in new cases across the province.Last Friday, prayer gatherings resumed in up to 180 Iranian cities and towns seen as being at low risk of coronavirus contagion after a two-month suspension, state media reported.The resumption of Friday prayers — still banned in the capital Tehran and some other major cities — followed the reopening last Monday of 132 mosques in areas consistently free of the virus.Schools will reopen next week, President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday, according to the official presidency website.Iran has already lifted a ban on inter-city trips and malls, with large shopping centres resuming activities.Iran’s coronavirus deaths rose by 45 in the past 24 hours to 6,685, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said in a statement on state TV. It has 109,286 diagnosed cases.Iran, one of the countries in the Middle East hit hardest by the novel coronavirus, has begun easing restrictions on normal life in order to support its economy, already battered by U.S. sanctions. Health officials have repeatedly warned, however, that easing restrictions could lead to a renewed spike in the number of infections. Rouhani also announced the replacement of the minister of industry, mines and trade on Monday, according to the official presidency website, a decision that appeared to be an attempt to boost the economy.Hossein Modares Khiabani will replace Reza Rahmani as the caretaker head of the ministry, the announcement said without noting why Rahmani was dismissed.Rouhani called on Khiabani to stabilise car prices, eliminate obstacles for domestic production and expand non-oil exports.In a letter addressed to Rouhani, Rahmani wrote that the reason for his removal was that the parliament had not agreed to the formation of a ministry of commerce, according to Fars news, which published a copy of the letter.Rouhani’s chief of staff had warned Rahmani that if he did not lobby parliamentarians for the formation of the ministry he would be dismissed, Rahmani wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-lockdown-all-mosques-in-iran-to-reopen-temporarily-today/story-s85VXRKRkjg7ZMVs8w9FCI.html
12-05-2020||World||Donald Trump’s wonder drug against Covid-19 does not work, says US study||A decades-old antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine, that was once touted as a game-changer by US President Donald Trump showed no benefits for Covid-19 patients observed in a large study of more than 1,400 people conducted in hospitals in New York city, the epicentre of the American epidemic.It had no noticeable effect even when taken along with the antibiotic azithromycin, showed the study.Cardiac arrest was a key side-effect when hydroxychloroquine was used together with azithromycin, according to the study. However, not when only the antimalarial drug was administered.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here President Trump had once promoted the antimalarial drug, by itself or in combination with the antibiotic, as a game-changer and had personally campaigned for it to be administered to patients arguing they had nothing to lose, because it had been used for decades and had been proven to be safe for humans.The US president also tried to shore up the availability of the drug in the United States and leaned on India, one of the largest producers of hydroxychloroquine in the world, to release a massive US purchase order of the drug blocked from shipping by an export ban on it and two dozen other medicines. The Modi government lifted the curbs and the US consignment was shipped shortly.Hydroxychloroquine is being used in India as a prophylaxis for health workers at the frontline of the country’s response to the epidemic.“Among patients hospitalized in metropolitan New York with Covid-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both, compared with neither treatment, was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality,” researchers behind the study wrote in a article in the Journal of the AmericanMedical Association (JAMA), a weekly journal of peer-reviewed research.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage And there are side-effects of the combination, contrary to what the president had so frequently claimed. “Compared with patients receiving neither drug cardiac arrest was significantly more likely in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin …. but not hydroxychloroquine alone … or azithromycin alone …,” said the study.This was an observational study of severely ill hospitalized patients who had been prescribed the medicines, and not a randomized clinical trial, the gold standard for determining the efficacy and safety of a drug. They are underway separately and results are awaited. President Trump has not spoken of the medicines lately. News reports indicated that advance word of the findings were shared with the federal government two weeks ago. The US Food and Drug Administration, the regulator of medicines, that had issued allowed the antimalarial drug to be used on compassionate grounds earlier restricted its use only for the clinical trials strictly under the supervision of physicians subsequently, citing toxic after effects.But here is what Trump said last week when asked about studies questioning the use of hydroxychloroquine: “I’ve had three calls in the last three days, four days, of people that took it, and they’re giving it credit for saving their lives.” He went on to qualify it severely given new information: “Here’s -- here’s what we’ve been reduced to in this country: The Democrats, the radical left, whatever you want, would rather see people -- I’m going to be very nice. I’m not going to say “die”. I’m going to say would rather see people not get well because they think I’m going to get credit if, you know, hydroxychloroquine works.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-wonder-drug-against-covid-19-does-not-work-says-us-study/story-sT9RfN8wOPHXqOLdCsGvMJ.html
12-05-2020||World||China’s Wuhan sees first new virus cases since lockdown lifted||Wuhan, where the global coronavirus epidemic first started, reported its first new infections since the Chinese city ended its 76-day lockdown on April 8.The six locally transmitted cases, reported on May 10 and 11, were found in people already under quarantine who were asymptomatic before testing positive, according to the local government. All six cases emerged from a single residential compound.Although the new cases are few and appear under control, they serve as a reminder of the risks China faces as it tries to reopen an economy that has seen its worst contraction since 1992.“Seven provinces reported new infections over the past 14 days, and clustered cases were continuing to increase,” Mi Feng, spokesman for the National Health Commission, said on Monday. China reported only one confirmed case on Tuesday, with no new infections in Wuhan.Wuhan will enhance the control of residential areas, expand testing among key people and strengthen the management of asymptomatic patients to contain the spread of the virus, according to a statement Sunday by the city’s health commission.Fears of resurgence were highlighted on Sunday when the northeastern city of Shulan, which borders North Korea, was partially locked down after 11 new infections were discovered. Many cities in China still don’t allow cinemas and bars to operate, and heavy restrictions against social gatherings remain in place. Face masks are required for public transport and entering stores and public facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-wuhan-sees-first-new-virus-cases-since-lockdown-lifted/story-W1BWkEtWxyjH4Fgi6p1iYK.html

Having lost their H-1B job, they have to go back to India within the stipulated 60 days as required by law. The couple has two kids aged one and six years who are American citizens.In the wee hours of Monday, they had to return from Newark airport as Air India refused to give their kids a ticket to fly to India along with them, despite them having a valid Indian visa. The young mother and father are Indian citizens.They said that the officials from Air India and (Indian) Consulate (in New York) were very cooperative.But they could not do anything as their hands were tied by the latest regulation issued by the Indian government, a shocked Ratna Pandey told PTI.“I would like to urge the Indian government to reconsider their decision on the humanitarian basis,” said the Indian national who has lost her job but could not leave the US within the stipulated 60 days to avoid any future visa complications.She now plans to make an appeal to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to extend their stay.Last month, H-1B visa holders, mostly Indians, launched a White House petition urging US President Donald Trump to extend their permissible stay from 60 to 180 days after job loss. However, there has been no decision from the White House so far.While there is no official statistics of how many Indian H-1B visa holders have lost their jobs, it is believed to be substantial.The US, due to the coronavirus pandemic, is experiencing an unprecedented unemployment rate and more than 33 million Americans have lost their jobs in the last two months. Given this massive job loss, Indians, who have lost their jobs, are unlikely to get one and thus many would have no other option but to travel back home.In the case of single mother Mamta (name changed), the situation is graver as her son is just three-month old. Only she was given the ticket and the infant was not allowed to fly along with her because he carried an American passport.“I would like to request the Indian government to let us fly back home. I don’t want to stay in the US any longer,” she told PTI hours after being prevented from boarding her hometown Ahmedabad-bound flight from Newark on Sunday.“I am alone here. I don’t have a relative here. It’s a difficult situation,” she said.“Vande Bharat Mission is a humanitarian mission. But this is certainly inhuman,” said Rakesh Gupta (name changed) from Washington DC.An H-1B professional, Gupta has lost his job and needs to return to India within the stipulated 60 days. He and his wife, Geeta (name changed) being Indian citizens, received the confirmation of their seats in the flight but have been told that their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter cannot travel with them as she carried an OCI card.“I don’t believe this,” he said.Unlike the Pandey couple and Mamta, who had made the payment of USD 1,361 per ticket for their flight back home, Rakesh has not made the payment. Air India has said that the money would be refunded.All the three Indian citizens requested the Indian government to help them travel back home by making necessary changes in the current regulations.As per a recent government notification, all existing Indian visa holders, and visa-free travel facility, granted to OCI card holders who are not in India, have been suspended till restrictions on international air travel remains.New York-based community leader Prem Bhandari said that the May 5 travel advisory has created multiple painful issues for the OCI card holders in the US and also to Indian citizens who are either on Green Card or H-1B visas and want to travel back home, but cannot leave their kids who are Americans by birth.“We would like to express our disappointment with the discrimination between OCIs and citizens in respect of entering India at this critical stage when many OCIs have lawfully built their homes, families and businesses in India,” Bhandari said in a letter to Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/visa-oci-card-suspension-prevents-several-indians-in-us-from-flying-back-home/story-4eFuEXfcERoqQPR9XzX2JN.html

However, Quebec, the province worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, has started reopening several schools and has also eased some restrictions as the overall caseload appeared to be tapering in the country. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, however, has warned that moving too quickly on trying to return to some normalcy could force the country back into “confinement” this summer.Canada recorded 5,100 deaths by Monday evening, as the tally of those infected also closed in on 70,000. A significant portion of the death toll was in the province of Quebec, at over 3,000. But on Monday, some students were back in their classrooms in elementary schools with class sizes being limited to a maximum of 15. That, though, was outside the Montreal area, as that city remains under severe restrictions being the epicentre of the coronavirus crisis in Quebec. Other provinces like Ontario have also taken to gradual easing, with more businesses allowed to reopen, though the province will maintain emergency measures till June 2.These moves come as the situation seemed to be improving in the country. In a statement, Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam said, “We have come a long way in a short time since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared and our efforts have undoubtedly prevented wider spread of the virus across the country.”However, Trudeau has warned against a rush to ease restrictions. During a media briefing, he said, “We are still in the emergency phase”, adding that the “vast majority of Canadians will continue to need to be very careful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-still-in-emergency-phase-rush-can-force-canada-back-into-confinement-warns-justin-trudeau/story-EXHY14d2KBnzD3NwmZrjBI.html

Canada is also part of a group of nations, led by the United States and Japan, seeking observer status for Taiwan at the World Health Organisation, a move strongly opposed by China, which does not recognise the existence of Taiwan as a separate nation.Trudeau also said discussions with respect to the defective masks were in progress with the Montreal-based supplier, which has not been identified. “We will not be burdened with masks that do not fit our stringent requirements,” he said.This is not the first time that Canada has faced problems with such masks from China. Last month, a million such masks imported from China were found to be faulty. Early last month, the country’s largest city, Toronto, returned nearly 62,000 masks, to a Chinese vendor. At that time, the Mayor’s office noted in a statement, “After reports of ripping and tearing, further inspection of the masks determined that the masks ordered did not meet the city’s standard and specifications. The masks are being returned, and the vendor has committed to a full refund.”Canadian officials have privately told the media in the country that Chinese vendors, backed by Beijing, have indulged in price gouging in a “competitive market” for such protective equipment, inflating the prices to five times the rate prior to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-not-pay-china-for-nearly-eight-million-substandard-masks-canadian-pm-trudeau/story-GbAAr8aQECusFv1zHx59eO.html

Don’t ask me, ask China that question, OK?”Jiang, who identifies herself in her Twitter bio as a “Chinese born West Virginian,” pushed back.“Sir, why are you saying that to me specifically?” she said, implying it was due to her race.“I’m saying it to anybody who would ask a nasty question like that,” Trump said.He then attempted to move on to another reporter as Jiang continued to press him about his response.Trump called on another female reporter but then immediately called on someone else.When the woman tried to ask her question, Trump abruptly ended the press conference and walked back into the White House.The internet was quick to rally round Jiang, with the hashtag #StandWithWeijiaJiang soon trending on Twitter.“I #StandWithWeijiaJiang against Trump’s racist tantrums,” tweeted “Star Trek” actor and prominent Asian-American activist George Takei.Reporter and CNN political analyst April Ryan, who has also been on the receiving end of Trump’s words, tweeted: “Welcome to the club!

Pence worked at the White House on Monday but did not attend a news conference held in the Rose Garden. Officials who attended wore masks, and speakers used a different podium from the one used by Trump.ABC News first reported about the memo, which also said unnecessary visits from other parts of the White House complex to the West Wing area, which includes the Oval Office and work space for senior advisers, are being discouraged.Officials who work near the president have been getting tested for the coronavirus but previously had not been wearing masks on a regular basis.“Common sense has finally prevailed,” one senior administration official told Reuters.Trump has been resistant to wearing a mask himself and has not put one on in public, though he said he tried some on backstage during a visit to a mask factory in Arizona last week.On Saturday he met the top leaders of the US military, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and members of his national security team in the White House Cabinet Room. The officials did not wear masks but had been tested for the virus in advance, a Pentagon spokesman said, adding that social distancing measures appeared to have been met. Secret Service agents in the room wore masks.The president is in the age group that is considered high risk for complications with the coronavirus, which has killed more than 80,000 people in the United States alone and ravaged countries and economies worldwide.Staff members including Jared Kushner, the president’s senior adviser and son-in-law, wore masks on White House grounds on Monday.The White House said last week it was stepping up precautions for people who spend time around Trump and Pence, both of whom have resumed travel outside of Washington. The two men are being tested for the virus daily.“In addition to social distancing, daily temperature checks and symptom histories, hand sanitizer, and regular deep cleaning of all work spaces, every staff member in close proximity to the president and vice president is being tested daily for Covid-19 as well as any guests,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.After Pence’s spokeswoman, Katie Miller, tested positive for the virus last week, Trump was asked whether people in the West Wing would begin to wear masks. He responded that people already were doing so. But he and his guests that day had not donned masks, and staff in the West Wing were not wearing them either.Miller is married to Stephen Miller, a senior White House aide and speech writer for the president.Some who had contact with Katie Miller have gone into partial quarantine. An administration official said Pence worked from the White House on Monday but would be maintaining distance from the president for the immediate future, in consultation with the White House medical unit.“We can talk on the phone,” Trump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-directs-staff-to-wear-masks-after-officials-contract-coronavirus/story-Sxu1OlyP7ysxyE3m9gT4nJ.html

Economic and Social Council video briefing the original thinking two months ago was that it may take 12 to 18 months for a vaccine. But he said an accelerated effort is under way, helped by 7.4 billion euros ($8 billion) pledged a week ago by leaders from 40 countries, organizations and banks for research, treatment and testing.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHe said the $8 billion will not be enough, and additional funds will be needed to speed up the development of a vaccine, but more importantly to produce enough “to make sure that this vaccine reaches everyone — (and) there’s no one be left behind.”“We have good candidates now,” Tedros said. “The top ones are around seven, eight. But we have more than a hundred candidates.”“We are focusing on the few candidates we have which can bring probably better results and accelerating those candidates with better potential,” he said.Tedros did not identify the top candidates.Since January, he said, “WHO has been working with thousands of researchers all over the world to accelerate and track vaccine development from developing animal models to clinical trial designs and everything in between.”Tedros said there is also a consortium of more than 400 scientists involved in vaccine development and diagnostics.The WHO chief stressed that Covid-19 is “very contagious and it’s a killer,” with over 4 million cases now reported to WHO and almost 275,000 lives lost.While new cases are declining in Western Europe, they are increasing in Eastern Europe, Africa, southeast Asia, the eastern Mediterranean and other regions, he said.Tedros said “the pandemic is teaching us many painful lessons,” especially the importance of having strong national and regional health systems.“And yet on current trends, more than 5 billion people will not access these essential services by 2030” — the ability to see a health worker, access essential medicine, and have running water in hospitals, he said.He stressed that as the response to Covid-19 continues, nations must also lay the foundations for a healthy, safer and fairer world.“The world spends around $7.5 trillion on health care each year, almost 10 percent of global GDP, but the best investments are in promoting health and in preventing disease at the primary health care level which will save lives and save money,” Tedros said.U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed told the briefing that all nations are “in it together” but the immediate priority must be the most vulnerable countries and communities.She called for a new debt relief program for vulnerable countries so their economies can recover.And she said measures to protect and stimulate the economy, from cash transfers to credits and loans must be targeted at women “who make up the majority of those in the hardest-hit informal economy, and who are at the forefront of the community response.”The head of the International Labor Organization said the U.N. agency estimates the equivalent of 305 million full-time jobs will be lost around the world in the second quarter of this year, which ends on June 30.ILO Director-General Guy Ryder told the briefing that by comparison, only 22 million full-time jobs were lost immediately when the financial crisis hit in 2008-2009, “so you can see we’re in an entirely different place.”Ryder said it’s also often forgotten that 60 percent of the global workforce of 3.3 billion have jobs in the informal economy, most of them women.He said the ILO estimates that in the first month of the pandemic, with lock-downs and economic shutdowns, “these people have lost on average 60 percent of their income, their revenues from work.” And they are concentrated in countries with scarce resources and the weakest social protection systems, he said.Ryder called for international cooperation to help those most in need and for stepped up efforts to keep enterprises alive, retain jobs, maintain the link between enterprises and workers even when they can’t work now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-7-or-8-top-candidates-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-exist/story-STHVqwuc8xClxXcKJMEgHJ.html
12-05-2020||World||Workers in US auto industry return to jobs amid concerns of 2nd Covid-19 wave||Factory workers began returning to assembly lines in Michigan on Monday, paving the way to reopen the US auto sector but stoking fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections as strict lockdowns are eased across the country. With millions of Americans out of work and much of the economy at a virtual standstill, a growing number of states are ending tough restrictions on commerce and social life put in place to slow the outbreak.Some auto suppliers in Michigan, a Midwest industrial powerhouse hard hit by the pandemic and its economic fallout, reopened plants on Monday with skeleton crews to get ready for a resumption of vehicle production next week. Skilled-trades workers and salaried employees also began returning auto assembly plants themselves to prepare for the wider restart. “We’re starting up our foundry this week in anticipation of the orders coming in next week,” Joe Perkins, chief executive of Busche Performance Group, an engineering, casting and machining firm, said in a telephone interview.Factory workers will be issued face masks, checked for fever and required to submit health-screening questionnaires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/workers-in-us-auto-industry-return-to-jobs-amid-concerns-of-2nd-covid-19-wave/story-4oUtRt6LoaQK7VNCtH2TdJ.html

His move has highlighted the competition for jobs and ignited a rush to woo the billionaire executive by states that have reopened their economies more quickly in response to encouragement from US President Donald Trump.In an email on Monday, Tesla referred to an order on Thursday by California’s governor allowing manufacturers to resume operations and said that as of Sunday, previously furloughed employees were back to their regular employment status.“We’re happy to get back to work and have implemented very detailed plans to help you keep safe as you return,” according to the email seen by Reuters and titled “Furlough Has Ended And We Are Back To Work in Production!”Musk in a tweet said production was resuming on Monday, adding that he would join workers on the assembly line. “If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me,” he wrote.Health officials in Alameda County, where the Fremont factory is based, late on Monday said they were aware that Tesla had opened beyond the so-called minimum basic operations allowed during lockdown, and had notified the company it could not operate without a county-approved plan.In a statement, officials said they expected a proposal from Tesla later on Monday and “hope Tesla will likewise comply without further enforcement measures.” The statement did not specify consequences and said officials would not comment further.The county’s lockdown order says violations are punishable by fine, imprisonment or both. A spokeswoman for the Fremont Police Department on Monday said her office was enforcing the lockdown order at the direction of the health department and had been advised that the county is working with Tesla directly.Separately on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said California should do whatever is necessary to help the electric carmaker reopen its only US vehicle factory if it wants to keep the company in its state.California Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday said he spoke to Musk several days ago and that the Tesla founder’s concerns helped prompt the state to begin its phased reopening of manufacturing last week. “I have not only known that company but I have known its founder for many, many years,” Newsom said in his daily coronavirus press briefing. “I have great reverence for their technology, for their innovative spirit, for their leadership.”Tesla, which also has a vehicle plant in Shanghai and is building another in Berlin, on Saturday sued the county, alleging it had violated California’s constitution by defying Newsom’s orders allowing manufacturers to reopen.Musk has discussed opening a second US factory outside California in the past. In a tweet in February, he solicited comments on potentially opening a factory in Texas.Since his threat to leave California on Saturday, officials from Texas, Georgia, Utah, Oklahoma and Nevada have reached out to Musk on Twitter, encouraging him to relocate to their state.A Texas official said his county was available immediately to accommodate Tesla and invited the billionaire CEO for a visit.“We have a motivated, pro-business governor,” Richard Cortez, county judge of Texas’ Hidalgo County, said on Monday. “What we no longer have is a shelter at home mandate.”Musk in response tweeted: “Note is much appreciated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-says-ready-for-arrest-as-he-reopens-california-plant-against-local-order/story-gowsbH7BynfogJdTcO7J7O.html
12-05-2020||World||Donald Trump faces coronavirus risk at home as echoes to ‘reopen’ nation grow louder||As he encourages the country to “reopen,” President Donald Trump is confronting cases of the coronavirus in his own home, spotlighting the challenge the White House faces in instilling confidence in a nation still reeling from the pandemic.Two known cases of Covid-19 among staffers in one of the most-protected complexes in America have sent three of the nation’s top medical experts into quarantine and Vice President Mike Pence into “self-isolation.” The scare comes as the White House this week is emphasizing to the American people the steps being taken to assure their safety — in hopes that will coax them to resume normal activities.“This week - you’ll hear the @WhiteHouse talk about preparedness & confidence,” tweeted Alyssa Farah, the White House director of strategic communications. “The Trump Admin is working around the clock to build our testing capacity, grow our PPE stockpiles, distribute therapeutics, & get $ to states to SAFELY reopen in a way Americans can have CONFIDENCE in.”Yet, that message was undercut by the exposure of senior government officials to positive cases at the White House itself.Pence on Monday led the White House’s weekly call with governors from an isolated room, after his press secretary tested positive Friday. Dr. Deborah Birx and other staffers participated as usual from a conference room in the Situation Room, Pence said, explaining the “slightly different circumstance.”“We are taking the appropriate countermeasures to protect the president’s health,” Pence added, according to a recording obtained by the AP. The White House was moving to daily testing of some staff members to detect the disease.The stepped-up protective measures comes as Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, and the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Stephen Hahn, were all quarantining after exposure to the White House staffer.The three experts are scheduled to testify before a Senate panel Tuesday on “Safely Getting Back to Work and Back to School.” However, they, along with committee chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., will all participate remotely. Alexander is quarantining after a staff member of his own tested positive for COVID-19.The images of top administration officials taking such precautions come as states seek to loosen economic restrictions put in place to mitigate the virus’ spread.Trump on Monday was complaining that Democratic governors were too slow in lifting restrictions in their states.“The great people of Pennsylvania want their freedom now, and they are fully aware of what that entails,” he tweeted. “The Democrats are moving slowly, all over the USA, for political purposes. They would wait until November 3rd if it were up to them. Don’t play politics. Be safe, move quickly!”Trump was scheduled to travel to the state on Thursday, according to advisories from the Federal Aviation Administration.Decisions about how fast to reopen are being made with the general election less than six months away, and Trump and other incumbents facing it in the midst of a public health and economic crisis.“If we do this carefully, working with the governors, I don’t think there’s a considerable risk,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on “Fox News Sunday.” “Matter of fact, I think there’s a considerable risk of not reopening. You’re talking about what would be permanent economic damage to the American public.”Mnuchin was one of several economic advisers the White House dispatched on Sunday to place the focus on the merits of loosening restrictions on the economy. Yet attention to possible risks of infection also turned to how the virus even found its way into the White House.Fauci’s institute said he was “taking appropriate precautions” to mitigate the risk to others while still carrying out his duties, teleworking from home but willing to go to the White House if called. Officials said both Redfield and Hahn will be self-quarantining for two weeks.Pence’s press secretary, Katie Miller, tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday, making her the second person who works at the White House complex known to test positive for the virus in the past week. A military service member who acts as a valet to the president tested positive on Thursday, the first known instance for a person in close proximity to Trump at the White House.The announced precautions contrast with a president who has declined to wear a face covering in meetings at the White House or at his public events.Kevin Hassett, an adviser to Trump and the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged Sunday it’s “scary to go to work” in the White House, calling the West Wing a “small, crowded place. It’s, you know, a little bit risky.”Hassett said he wears a mask when necessary and practices “aggressive social distancing.” Appearing on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” he said any fears are tempered by frequent testing, access to an excellent medical team and his belief that this is a time “when people have to step up and serve their country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-faces-coronavirus-risk-at-home-as-echoes-to-reopen-nation-grow-louder/story-Y0uf3DLykOlp1vY3cL4UaM.html
