Would she get the chance to get married and have her own children? Driving across the causeway that separates the family’s home north of Lake Pontchartrain from the New Orleans hospital where their daughter was taken — with what was later determined to be a coronavirus infection — she was forced to imagine a life without her Juliet.“She’s the sweetest girl. She’s the sweetest girl in the whole world. And she does not deserve this. And I was praying to God ... just please, please help, please help me,” said Jennifer, speaking from the family’s Covington home Thursday, with her husband Sean and their now-recovered daughter.As Juliet and her 5-year-old brother spar with each other using pool noodles, it’s hard to imagine that just earlier this month Juliet was fighting for her life. At one point she had a heart attack and doctors had to perform CPR for two minutes before she came back.“I died and came back,” Juliet said.Her coronavirus journey didn’t start with many of the symptoms that have affected adults — breathing problems, for example. She had stomach pain and vomiting, and her mother, who’s a radiologist, thought maybe it was appendicitis or some type of stomach problem. But Juliet’s lips were also turning blue and her limbs were cold.Juliet quickly ended up in the emergency room of the local hospital. There, she had a heart attack, underwent CPR, and was eventually airlifted to Ochsner Medical Center. Dr. Jake Kleinmahon was one of the doctors who was there to meet her and care for her over the next ten days.“Juliet came in as one of the sickest children we’ve taken care of with Covid-19,” said Kleinmahon. The top chamber of her heart was not working correctly with the bottom chamber, and she was developing “multisystem organ failure,” he said.Kleinmahon said children with coronavirus infections often have different symptoms than adults, such as the abdominal problems Juliet had, or rashes in other cases. He said many children also have another virus besides the coronavirus and that was the case with Juliet.For most people, the virus causes no, mild or moderate symptoms, but some suffer severe disease and even death.Juliet was on a ventilator for four days, during which she was sedated and then was eventually able to breathe on her own. She was discharged on April 15. The doctor said her heart function is now completely normal.Although she likely has a little trauma to her heart that should decrease over time, he expects she’ll have a “totally normal life.” When she regained consciousness, her parents said she immediately worried about missing school. Her mother said that when she told Juliet what had happened, her eyes got as big as saucers.“At first I was freaking out a lot,” Juliet said. And then she was worried about whether there were any lasting effects to her body.Jennifer said she and her husband hadn’t known anyone who’d even been infected with coronavirus until their daughter became so drastically ill. If they hadn’t gotten her to the hospital in time, they don’t know if she’d be alive today. She’s glad Juliet doesn’t remember those four days on a ventilator — days Jennifer will never forget.“All she remembers is daddy telling her she’s going to go to sleep. ‘They’re going to put a tube down your throat. You’re gonna go on a helicopter ride. You’re gonna wake up in a new hospital and mommy will be there’” said Jennifer. “Well, that’s what happened.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-died-and-came-back-12-year-old-recovers-from-coronavirus/story-U61lREiN31LaCJ2BDxrEPP.html
01-05-2020||World||UK coronavirus death toll reaches 27,510||UK has shot past its 100,000 daily coronavirus tests target set for the end of April with 122,347 testing on Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced on Friday.Addressing the daily Downing Street briefing, the senior minister hailed the “audacious” testing goal being met by a coordinated team effort as he revealed a further 739 deaths from Covid-19, taking the country’s toll from the pandemic to 27,510.“At the beginning of last month, I set a goal that anyone who needs a test should get a test. That as a nation we should achieve 100,000 per day by the end of the month,” Hancock said.“I knew it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal because testing is so important. I can announce we have met our goal. This unprecedented expansion in British testing capability is an incredible achievement,” he said.The criteria set by the government for people accessing coronavirus tests cover over 25 million National Health Service (NHS) staff on the frontlines of the pandemic, key workers and others who need to leave the house to go to their job.Hancock said that testing will form the basis “for getting Britain back on her feet” and the easing of the lockdown in place to keep a lid on the rate of infection, referred to as R, with work underway to recruit the 18,00 contact tracers to keep track of the deadly virus.“People will be able to know if they had been in contact with someone with the disease. This will drive the infection rate down. It will get R down and hold R down,” he said.Professor John Newton, Director of Health Improvement at Public Health England, joined the Cabinet minister as the UK’s national coronavirus testing coordinator and declared that the country had succeeded in putting in place world-leading testing facilities.“We now have a flexible and substantial testing capability in the UK to tell us how the virus is spreading across the country,” he said.It was claimed that the latest data from hospitals and across the wider community reflects “real progress” as the number of infections is falling.The officials revealed that hospital admissions, particularly in London which was way ahead in terms of the infection than other parts of Britain, is continuing a downward trend and the number of people in critical care is also falling across the board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-by-739-to-27-510/story-QD1fSk5WGNnoHHRwVm2HhP.html
01-05-2020||World||Canada bans assault-style weapons after mass shooting||Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that Canada is banning the use and trade of assault-style weapons immediately.Trudeau cited numerous mass shootings in the country, including the killing of 22 people in Nova Scotia April 18 and 19. He announced the ban of over 1,500 models and variants of assault-style firearms, including the AR-15 and other weapons that have been used in a number of mass shootings in the United States“Canadians need more than thoughts and prayers,” Trudeau said.The Cabinet order doesn’t forbid owning any of the military-style weapons and their variants but it does ban the use and trade in them. He said the order has a two-year amnesty period for current owners, and there will be a compensation program that will require a bill passed in Parliament.In the meantime, they can be exported, returned to manufacturers, and transported only to deactivate them or get rid of them. In certain limited circumstances, they can be used for hunting.“You do not need an AR-15 to take down a deer,” Trudeau said. “So, effective immediately, it is no longer permitted to buy, sell, transport, import or use military-grade, assault weapons in this country.”Trudeau said the weapons were designed for one purpose and one purpose only: to kill the largest number of people in the shortest amount of time.“There is no use - and no place - for such weapons in Canada,” he said.Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada, but Trudeau said they are happening more often. Trudeau noted he was nearby when in Montreal when gunman Marc Lepine killed 14 women and himself at Montreal’s Ecole Polytechnique college in 1989. The Ruger Mini-14 Lepine used is among weapons included in the ban.“As of today the market for assault weapons is closed. Enough is enough,” Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said.Trudeau has said his government would introduce further gun control legislation prohibiting military-style assault weapons, a measure that had already been planned before the coronavirus pandemic interrupted the current parliamentary session.The gunman in Nova Scotia, 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, shot 13 people to death and set fires that killed nine others in one of the worst mass shootings in the country’s history. Police have said he used a handgun that was obtained in Canada and long guns that he obtained in the U.S., but they have not specifically said what guns he used. The rampage started with an assault on his girlfriend and it ended with 22 people dead in communities across central and northern Nova Scotia. A number of people had disputes with the gunman.Opposition Conservative leader Andrew Scheer accused Trudeau of using the “immediate emotion of the horrific attack in Nova Scotia to push the Liberals’ ideological agenda and make major firearms policy changes.”Scheer said the Nova Scotia shooter did not have a firearms licence, so all of his guns were illegal.“Taking firearms away from law-abiding citizens does nothing to stop dangerous criminals who obtain their guns illegally,” Scheer said in a statement. “The vast majority of gun crimes are committed with illegally obtained firearms. Nothing the Trudeau Liberals announced today addresses this problem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-bans-assault-style-weapons-after-mass-shooting/story-a8jDvShhPi8XX877juF7HN.html
01-05-2020||World||Kuwait offers to evacuate 45,000 Indians who benefited from visa amnesty scheme||Kuwait on Friday offered to evacuate thousands of illegal Indian workers who benefited from a general amnesty, even as people familiar with developments said the two sides were in touch to resolve the issue.Kuwaiti ambassador Jassem Al-Najem highlighted his government’s efforts to evacuate “all illegal workers of different nationalities, including Indian nationals, who were granted general amnesty”, according to a statement.The Kuwaiti government has offered to send back the workers to their countries “free of cost and by its own civil airlines”, Al-Najem said. “Kuwait is looking forward to work with the Indian government to implement its massive evacuation plan to bring back the Indians who are willing to come back voluntarily to India after the complete lockdown ends on May 3…,” he added.The statement was issued hours before the Indian government announced a two-week extension of the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown alongside the phased easing of restrictions in some areas.Though the Kuwaiti statement didn’t give the number of Indians who benefited from the general amnesty, people familiar with developments in both countries said almost 45,000 Indian workers had been covered by the scheme.Amid the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Kuwaiti side is keen on the speedy evacuation of the illegal workers from all countries.“The Indian embassy is in touch with the Kuwaiti authorities to explore the best possible mechanism to facilitate the return of Indians form Kuwait,” one of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.There was no official word on the development from the Indian side.Kuwait had recently announced an amnesty till April 30 for illegal migrants and workers whose visas expired after the imposition of Covid-19-related travel restrictions. Migrants who were undocumented or overstayed their visas will be allowed to leave Kuwait without paying fines.Al-Najem also thanked the Indian government for facilitating the evacuation of Kuwaiti nationals stranded in the country on Kuwait Airways flights last week. He also thanked the Indian government for deploying a medical rapid response team to Kuwait for two weeks and providing two tonnes of medical equipment.“The ambassador highly appreciated the Indian government’s gestures to continue supply of medicine, including paracetamol tablets and foods to Kuwait,” the statement said.Indian and Kuwaiti authorities had to resort to damage control this week after a Cabinet note of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member state that expressed concern about “targeting of Indian Muslims” was leaked on social media.Al-Najem reiterated a statement he had issued earlier this week that both countries shared the foreign policy principle of “non-interference in other countries’ affairs”.Indians constitute the largest group of expatriates in Kuwait, with an estimated population of 1 million and their annual remittances are worth about $4.8 billion. India is also among Kuwait’s top 10 trading partners, with bilateral trade worth $6.2 billion during 2015-16.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Kuwaiti counterpart Sheikh Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Sabah and external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart Ahmed Nasser Al-Mohammed Al-Sabah have spoken on phone recently regarding cooperation to control the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kuwait-offers-to-evacuate-45-000-indians-who-benefited-from-visa-amnesty-scheme/story-mhSeSuAxRKv9oLDGZmVtmK.html

President Donald Trump has publicly backed the protestors weighed in again Friday asking her in a tweet to “give a little, and put out the fire”.She extended the restrictions to May 15, after the Republican-controlled legislature refused. Arms are allowed in the Michigan statehouse. Some legislators wore bulletproof vests to the floor fo the House.An increasing number of states are reopening and have allowed selected businesses to resume operation with strict social-distancing guidelines as the number of news cases have continued to drop countrywide.Daily fatalities have dropped significantly, for instance, from the peak of over 4,000 around April 16. On Friday, the toll went up more than 63,019 with 2,029 death in the last 24 hours and the number of infections was up by 29,515 to 1.07 million.Signalling further continuing improvement in the situation, President Trump will leave the White House for the time since late March. He is scheduled to leave for Camp David - the presidential retreat in the adjoining state of Maryland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armed-protesters-demand-end-to-covid-19-curbs-in-us-state/story-EHxpswPfu5KeNEnLYwzIhP.html
01-05-2020||World||Hong Kong police spray tear gas at protesters gathered in a shopping mall||Hong Kong police used pepper spray on Friday to disperse over a hundred protesters in a shopping mall who were singing and chanting pro-democracy slogans.The demonstrators sang the protest anthem “Glory to Hong Kong” and chanted “Glory to Hong Kong, revolution of our times” in the New Town Plaza mall in Hong Kong’s New Territories.As protesters gathered in the mall, riot police stopped and searched some and later told them to leave, saying they were violating social-distancing rules. The police then sprayed tear gas to disperse the crowd before cordoning off the atrium of the mall.The protest was one of several that went ahead on May 1, Labor Day, despite rules that forbid public gatherings of more than four people.Small groups of protesters also gathered near Kowloon’s Mong Kok and Kwun Tong subway stations.Organizers initially planned citywide protests but many were canceled, with the organizers urging people to support pro-democracy restaurants instead.Friday’s protests were the latest in a string of demonstrations over the past week in which protesters gathered in shopping malls. They follow the arrest of 15 pro-democracy activists and former lawmakers last Saturday.The demonstrations are a continuation of a movement that began last June to protest an extradition bill that would have allowed detainees in Hong Kong to be transferred to mainland China. Although the bill was later withdrawn, the demonstrations continued for months before a lull starting in January as the coronavirus pandemic broke out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-spray-tear-gas-at-protesters-gathered-in-a-shopping-mall/story-60heYVDnxDoiwEAqSzVVII.html
01-05-2020||World||Donald Trump points to Wuhan lab as Covid-19 source, threatens new tariffs as punishment||President Donald Trump on Thursday said the United States has intelligence that establishes a virology lab in Wuhan is the source of the pandemic and indicated new tariffs as his administration considers a range of punitive measures such as partly cancelling public debt and allowing victims to sue China.“Yes I have,” Trump told reporters when asked if he has seen intelligence that traces the epidemic’s origin to the Wuhan lab with a high degree of confidence. He did not share any evidence and when asked how he felt confident it was the Wuhan lab, he demurred, saying, “I am not allowed to tell you that.”Earlier Thursday, office of the Director of National Intelligence, which heads the US intelligence community, said in the statement that though it concurs with the wider scientific community that the coronavirus was “not manmade or genetically modified”, it was still examining “whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan”.The source of the epidemic remains disputed. China has denied it started at the Wuhan lab and has blamed a local seafood market instead.The United Sates has been investigating the origin of the epidemic in China, and the Wuhan lab has clearly not been ruled out, and the true magnitude of the crisis in China, which is widely suspected of suppressing the real numbers.Questions are being raised about China’s handling of the epidemic and calls for an impartial investigation into it have been growing worldwide, most recently by Australia.The US intelligence community is conducting its own investigation as the office of the DNI stated Thursday. But it was not clear yet if the administration expected to revea more on the findings and how soon. The president has turned up the rhetoric on China in recent days as his won administration’s handling of the crisis has come under increasing criticism for not responding aggressively. He recently indicated he was not averse to making China pay for losses incurred by the United States.When asked on Thursday about reports that he could cancel US debt obligations to China, Trump said he could “do it differently” and act in “probably a little bit more of a forthright manner”.“I could do the same thing but even for more money, just putting on tariffs,” he said.The new tariffs, if he does impose them, will be in addition to the 25% duty still in force on $370 billion worth of imports from China left over from the trade war between the two countries that ended in January with the signing of a limited Phase One deal.The Washington Post reported Thursday that punitive measures under discussion partly cancelling public debt owed to China, which is the second largest holder of US public debt with around $1 trillion, and stripping China of sovereign immunity and allow American victims of the epidemic to sure China for damages.Officials from across US federal government were expected to meet Thursday to map the course of action but the president is reported to be tilting towards punishing China, away from a more moderate response being advocated by his economic advisers. But he appears to have not made up his mind yet.Republican lawmakers have also been been calling for punishing China. Senator Josh Hawley has moved a legislation to hold China “accountable” by designing a mechanism to make China pay compensation to all nations impacted by the epidemic and not just the united States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-points-to-wuhan-lab-as-covid-19-source-threatens-new-tariffs-as-punishment/story-MgMWXrEInXa2Rd9YStuJXJ.html
01-05-2020||World||Meghan Markle loses first round in newspaper lawsuit||The Duchess of Sussex lost an early round in a London court Friday when a judge dismissed part of her lawsuit against the publisher of a British newspaper that put out excerpts of a letter to her estranged father.Meghan sued Associated Newspapers for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement last year over a series of articles in the Mail on Sunday that reproduced parts of the letter she wrote in August 2018, several months after the former actress known as Meghan Markle married Britain’s Prince Harry.In a ruling on Friday, Judge Mark Warby threw out some of the causes of action argued in her lawsuit, including the claim that the newspaper publisher acted “dishonestly” by quoting only certain passages of her letter.Warby also struck the claim that Associated Newspapers deliberately “stirred up” a dispute between Meghan and her father, Thomas Markle, and had an agenda to publish intrusive or offensive stories about her.The judge said the allegations should not be part of the case as it proceeds because he found them irrelevant to establishing if the publisher was guilty of the illegal acts cited in the duchess’ lawsuit: misuse of private information, copyright infringement and breach of the Data Protection Act.However, Warby said the dismissed claims could be revived at a later stage of the case.Associated Newspapers denies the allegations.Meghan has previously said that if she won the case, she would donate any damages she might be awarded an anti-bullying charity.Her lawyers argue that the hand-written letter in question was a “private and intimate” message from a daughter to her father, and accuse the newspaper of targeting Meghan with “distortive, manipulative, and dishonest tactics.”“The duchess’ rights were violated; the legal boundaries around privacy were crossed,” her lawyers said in a statement Friday.They expressed surprise that the judge’s ruling ”suggests that dishonest behavior is not relevant,” but added that “the core elements of this case do not change and will continue to move forward.”Thomas Markle was scheduled to walk his daughter down the aisle at her and Prince Harry’s wedding ceremony in May 2018, but pulled out at the last minute, citing heart problems.The former television lighting director has given occasional interviews to the media, complaining in December 2018 that he’d been “ghosted” by Meghan after the wedding.The interviews and Markle’s relationship with his daughter complicated Meghan’s entry into the royal family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-loses-first-round-in-newspaper-lawsuit/story-2QKFJTJUtEklb5LSIcvXFL.html
01-05-2020||World||Virus worries haunt workers demanding rights on May Day||No job at all, or a job without enough protections — millions of workers worldwide are marking international labor day trapped between hunger and fear, as more countries and states reopen for business even though the coronavirus pandemic is far from vanquished.Beijing’s Forbidden City cracked open its doors, and shopping malls from Texas to Indiana were set to do the same Friday, while world leaders try to salvage virus-battered economies without unleashing new waves of infections.With traditional May Day labor marches curtailed by strict limits on public gatherings, Turkish protesters attempted to stage a wildcat demonstration. California activists planned strikes, and Parisians sang from balconies to plead their causes: workplace masks, health insurance or more government aid for the jobless.It’ was a melancholy International Workers’ Day for garment industry workers across southeast Asia such as Wiryono, a father of two in Indonesia’s capital who was laid off last month as retailers slashed orders. His side gig delivering coffee dried up, too, amid a virus lockdown. So he set up a clothing repair business to make ends meet.“I don’t earn as much as I got from the clothing factory. But I have to feed my wife and kids every day,” said Wiryono, who goes by only one name.In Bangladesh, production is starting back up even despite a rising number of new confirmed cases of a virus that has infected more than 3.2 million and killed at least 230,000 worldwide.A government-ordered lockdown couldn’t extinguish the May Day protest spirit in Greece, where demonstrators lined up two meters (six feet) apart in careful rows in Athens’ Syntagma Square. Organizers, wearing masks and gloves, used tape measures to set out exact positions for the protesters with large colored squares.Greeks who work by doing deliveries staged a motorized protest, driving through Athens on their motorbikes, and police were out in force to ensure residents don’t head from cities to the countryside, another May Day tradition.“We are praying for all workers, so that no one will lack work, and all will be fairly paid and can enjoy the dignity of work and the beauty of rest,” Pope Francis pleaded during a private morning Mass.May Day labor protests started in the 19th century in the United States, where this week the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits surpassed a staggering 30 million — and joblessness in April could hit numbers not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.Essential workers were expected to strike around the U.S. on Friday to demand safer conditions during the pandemic, while other groups organized rallies to protest stay-at-home orders they say are crippling the U.S. economy.Lacey Ward, an Omaha hairstylist, said she is worried that the Nebraska governor’s decision to let salons reopen on May 4 could put her and her family at risk. She would prefer to collect unemployment until the danger subsides.“I feel like we are literally the guinea pigs in this situation,” she said.May Day is a state holiday in many countries, but lockdowns mean this is the first time that Russia — whose prime minister has the virus — will not hold mass demonstrations on Red Square.In Turkey, police and protesters wearing masks faced off in Istanbul, and 15 people were detained for defying confinement rules.In the Czech Republic, people honked horns, played drums or shouted at midday in a special “noisy protest” over the government’s handling of the crisis. And hundreds of Czechs who commute to work in Germany and Austria plan to block a border crossing to protest restrictions imposed on them amid the pandemic.In the French spirit of keeping leaders in check, some Paris residents defied home confinement rules to hold unauthorized protests. Others staged a midday musical protest against French President Emmanuel Macron’s handling of the pandemic, singing from balconies and windows to the tune of the rebel’s anthem “Bella Ciao.”Instead of the usual May Day concert in Italy, musical artists will take turns performing solo in empty venues. As Italy prepares to reopen some businesses Monday, unions demanded scrupulous attention to social distancing at work stations and on assembly lines, and the sanitizing of factories before they start up again.A holiday atmosphere enlivened South Africa’s streets Friday, as the May Day holiday is also when the country has begun easing its strict lockdown. People were permitted to walk outside for exercise and some are returning to work in small batches.The country where the coronavirus first erupted also is opening up: China’s ancient, majestic Forbidden City reopened on Friday with all tickets for the May 1-5 holiday sold out, and a limit of 5,000 visitors a day, down from the earlier maximum of 80,000.Visitor Bian Jiang reveled at the chance to visit without huge crowds and said, “When walking in some areas without others around, I felt like I’m getting back to history.”In Spain, the closing of a massive field hospital that had symbolized the country’s battle against the virus and its overwhelmed health system held significance.Malaysia and Thailand prepared to reopen some businesses. Japan’s prime minister, however, announced his virus state of emergency would stay in place for another month.Worker and customer safety is a key question as the biggest U.S. mall operator, Simon Property Group Inc., plans to open 49 shopping centers Friday across 10 states, with mask-wearing employees and a limited number of shoppers.President Donald Trump chose not to extend the White House’s social-distancing guidelines past their expiration Thursday. Those guidelines encouraged people to work from home and avoid restaurants, groups and nonessential travel.Trump continued to speculate on the origins of the coronavirus, and intelligence agencies said they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.The virus has killed over 230,000 worldwide, including more than 61,000 in the U.S., according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Confirmed infections globally topped 3.2 million, with 1 million in the U.S., but the true numbers are believed to be much higher because of limited testing, differences in counting the dead and concealment by some governments.As Australia plans to open up, Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged people to download a COVIDSafe app to help track cases, and warned: “The coronavirus is still out there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virus-worries-haunt-workers-demanding-rights-on-may-day/story-uU1dSBNkx5l2PNTP4lF24O.html

Because it is a foreign organisation, it is not possible to ban and dissolve it, the ministry said in a statement.Israel, which with the United States had been pushing Germany to ban the group, praised the move. Israel urged other European Union countries to take similar action.The EU classifies Hezbollah’s military wing as a terrorist group, but not its political wing. Britain introduced legislation in February of last year, before it left the EU, that classified Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-condemns-germany-s-designation-of-hezbollah-as-terrorist-group/story-ia3XOodFVl2l4IP3Se88LJ.html

01-05-2020||World||Japan PM Abe leaning towards extending state of emergency, to decide May 4||Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday he was leaning towards extending the country’s state of emergency for about a month as experts said coronavirus restrictions should remain in place until the number of cases falls further. The emergency is now due to expire on May 6 but Abe said the situation remains tough and further cooperation is needed from Japanese citizens, although he would make a final decision on May 4 after consultations with experts. “Thanks to the efforts of our citizens, we have managed to avoid an explosion of cases as has been seen overseas,” Abe told reporters on Friday evening. “But the medical situation remains tough and we must call for forther cooperation from our nation.” He added that he was inclined towards extending the state of emergency for roughly a month and would hold a news conference to explain his decision.On Thursday, Abe warned citizens to prepare for a “drawn-out battle” against the new coronavirus and political sources told Reuters the government was planning to lengthen the emergency for about a month.Abe said he would base his final decision on the recommendation of a panel of experts, which said earlier on Friday that while the number of cases appeared to be on the decline, the situation was not as good as they would like.  “For a while, we are going to need to keep these policies going,” panel member Shigeru Omi told a news conference, adding that there were regional variations in outbreaks and the medical system in some areas was struggling to cope.Economics Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said experts had also said some regions needed to keep strict restrictions in place while others could start to ease them. Abe said he would consider this matter in making his final decision. Japan has confirmed more than 14,000 cases and 436 deaths from COVID-19, the highly contagious lung disease caused by the new coronavirus, according to an NHK tally. Of the confirmed cases, more than 4,000 were in the capital, Tokyo, with 165 new ones reported on Friday.But there are worries that Japan’s limited testing regime has undercounted many likely coronavirus cases, and fears that the medical system may be strained caring for them. The outbreak and the concurrent slump in business activity is darkening the outlook for the world’s third biggest economy, prompting calls for more spending even after parliament approved an extra budget to fund a $1.1 trillion stimulus package.Consumer prices in Tokyo fell for the first time in three years in April and national factory activity sagged, data showed on Friday, increasing worries the coronavirus outbreak could tip the country back into deflation.WARNINGThe government has appealed for vigilance during the long Golden Week holiday - normally a peak travel period - that runs through May 6, calling on people to stay home and reduce contact with others.Abe declared the emergency on April 7, initially for Tokyo and several other prefectures after a jump in infections, and later extended it nationwide.It gives governors greater power to tell people to stay at home and ask businesses to close, but in most cases does not mandate penalties for non-compliance, relying instead on social pressure and traditional respect for authority.Tokyo has seen a decline in daily reported cases since hitting a peak of 201 on April 17, with further falls into double digits this week. But the city’s governor, Yuriko Koike, has warned residents not to be complacent.On Friday, the Nippon Foundation, a philanthropic organisation, unveiled the first wing of a field hospital built in a waterside district of Tokyo.Set up in an arena built for Paralympic sports, the 100-bed facility features alcoves containing a bed, locker and table set apart from each other. Other beds will be put in tents and expanded as needed, NHK reported. The International Olympic Committee and the government in March postponed the summer Olympic and Paralympic Games in Japan for a year, until July 2021, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-pm-abe-leaning-towards-extending-state-of-emergency-to-decide-may-4/story-K2hmSLEK5ji6v1IWSfvDvM.html

In order to prevent the spread of the outbreak, local governments canceled public events, suspended the operation of companies and educational institutions, restricted access to potentially dangerous areas and made temporary requisitions for houses, cars, equipment and other resources.Local authorities also fully restricted the freedom of movement and migration, putting in place epidemiological screening for people and transport and put thousands of residents in quarantine if they are suspected to have contracted the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worst-hit-hubei-to-lower-covid-risk-level-outbreak-basically-cut-off/story-EkWtDMWTWTmVgbadLwJcUN.html
01-05-2020||World||WHO wants invite to China’s probe into virus origins||The World Health Organization said Friday it hoped China would invite it to take part in its investigations into the animal origins of the novel coronavirus.“WHO would be keen to work with international partners and at the invitation of the Chinese government to participate in investigation around the animal origins,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told AFP in an email.He said the UN health agency understood there were a number of investigations under way in China “to better understand the source of the outbreak”, but added that “WHO is not currently involved in the studies in China.”Scientists believe the killer virus jumped from animals to humans, emerging in China late last year, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat.But US President Donald Trump has fuelled speculation and rumours -- generally rejected by experts -- that the virus may have emerged in a top-secret Chinese lab.WHO has also faced scathing criticism from Trump, who earlier this month suspended Washington’s funding after accusing the WHO of downplaying the seriousness of the outbreak and of kowtowing to China.The UN health agency chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus did travel with a team to China in late January, where he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping to learn more about the response.This paved the way, Tedros explained earlier this week, for an international team of scientists to travel there in February to investigate the situation, including experts from China, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Nigeria, the Russian Federation, Singapore and the United States of America.But as investigations into the origins of the virus have picked up pace in China, the WHO has not been involved. The ongoing investigations are believed to be looking at “human cases with symptom onset in and around Wuhan in late 2019, environmental sampling from markets and farms in areas where the first human cases were identified, and detailed records on the source and type of wildlife species and farmed animals sold in these markets,” Jasarevic said.He stressed that the results from the virus origin studies were “essential to preventing further zoonotic introductions of the virus that causes COVID-19 into the human population.”“WHO continues to collaborate with animal health and human health experts, countries and other partners to identify gaps and research priorities for the control of COVID-19, including the eventual identification of the source of the virus in China,” he said.nl/rjm/lc||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-wants-invite-to-china-s-probe-into-virus-origins/story-WAFrQNsYNrXiAruzJPOkBP.html
01-05-2020||World||Foreign criticism of Hong Kong activists’ arrests “unfounded”: Report||Hong Kong hit back on Friday at Washington and London for condemning the arrests in April of 15 pro-democracy activists, saying that their criticism was “unfounded” and “grossly irresponsible.”Police arrested the activists, including Democratic Party founder Martin Lee, 81, and millionaire publishing tycoon Jimmy Lai, 71, on 18 April, in the biggest crackdown on the pro-democracy movement since the outbreak of mass protests last year.Foreign governments and human rights groups condemned the arrests, with Britain’s Foreign Office saying at the time that the right to peaceful protest was “fundamental to Hong Kong’s way of life” and authorities should avoid “actions that inflame tensions”.In its strongest response to the criticism so far, the Hong Kong government said the remarks by the United States, Britain and the European Parliament were “totally unfounded and amounted to a serious intervention in Hong Kong’s affairs”.“The allegation by some that those arrests amounted to an attack on Hong Kong’s freedoms ... is absurd and can hardly stand the test of any law-abiding jurisdiction,” a spokesman for the government said.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” style of governance that grants it broad freedoms, including the right to protest and an independent judiciary, not seen in the mainland.Critics say Beijing is increasingly encroaching on those freedoms, which the central government rejects.The 15 activists were arrested on charges of organising and participating in anti-government protests last year that crippled parts of the city and posed the gravest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping.The outbreak of the novel coronavirus and measures adopted to curb its spread have seen a relative lull in protests this year, although smaller demonstrations have emerged in the past week amid renewed concerns over Beijing’s tightening grip on the city.Fuelling those worries, questions have been raised in recent weeks over the role of Beijing’s institutions overseeing the city’s affairs - the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and Liaison Office.The government said criticism over remarks by the offices “only illustrates an ignorance of the constitutional order” of Hong Kong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/foreign-criticism-of-hong-kong-activists-arrests-unfounded-report/story-YVwf9ozmoBuQRbdDV9T1lM.html
01-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Bangladesh reopens factories, risking new cases||Bangladesh has reopened hundreds of its garment factories this week after nearly one month of closures to fight the coronavirus pandemic in a move critics say risks igniting a sharp increase in infections among workers.An industry group said about 850 factories are operating with fewer workers than usual and following safety guidelines. Labor advocates say not enough is being done to ensure safety for the 4 million workers in Bangladesh’s roughly 4,000 garment factories.The number of factories that have reopened is in dispute. Activists and analysts said Friday about 2,000 garment factories have restarted production.The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association says only 850 factories had opened by Thursday, using a limited number of workers who live nearby.“The global brands are happy to see the factories opening up as otherwise a whole season would have been lost,” Mohammad Abdur Razzak, secretary of the industry group, said in an email.Razzak said the factories were complying with health guidelines and that inspections found that only four of 105 visited were not meeting standards.As is true elsewhere workers and their employers are torn between suffering still more loss of income by staying closed and risking a surge in infections if they stop taking precautions too soon.The resumption of manufacturing followed a government decision to allow companies to reopen that was made under heavy pressure from businesses. Factories went ahead, fearing they might lose business to competitors in Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Sri Lanka and India.A senior government health official in a major industrial zone near Dhaka urged factories to close down again.Bangladesh has confirmed 7,667 people infected with coronavirus and 168 deaths since its first case was reported on March 8. About 500 new cases are being confirmed daily in the nation of 160 million people, which has only 25 testing facilities and a fragile healthcare system.Thousands of workers reportedly are rushing back to reclaim their jobs in the capital, Dhaka and nearby industrial districts, alarming labor advocates.“Who will take the responsibility if hundreds of workers become ill?” said Kalpona Akter, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Workers Solidarity.Ahsan H. Mansur, executive director of the local think tank Policy Research Institute, said at least another week should have been allowed to better prepare for reopening.“The factories have resumed operations without giving it much thought,” he said. “There is a huge risk of virus transmission among workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-bangladesh-reopens-factories-risking-new-cases/story-eOzvdvRDpCP0D1ThAnrfqI.html
01-05-2020||World||Biden denies former staffer’s sexual assault allegation||Joe Biden denied a former Senate staffer’s allegation of sexual assault on Friday, saying the accusation is “not true.”“This never happened,” Biden said in a statement.It’s Biden’s first public comment on an accusation of sexual assault by his former Senate staffer, Tara Reade. He is to appear on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” to discuss the allegation for the first time on television.Biden said he will ask the National Archives to determine whether there is any record of such a complaint being filed.Presumptive Democratic US presidential nominee Joe Biden for the first time on Friday is set to personally address a former Senate aide’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her in 1993 - a claim that his campaign has denied.Biden is scheduled to be interviewed about the matter on the MSNBC program “Morning Joe,” the cable TV network said on Twitter on Thursday. Biden’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the interview. His campaign has said the incident never occurred but he has remained silent about it.Earlier on Wednesday, US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, gave a forceful defense of Biden, highlighting the former vice president’s long history of supporting policies to stop the abuse of women.The interview plan comes after some fellow Democrats urged Biden, 77, to directly respond to the accusation. A California woman named Tara Reade, who worked as a staff assistant in Biden’s US Senate office from December 1992 to August 1993, has accused Biden in media interviews of pinning her against a wall in 1993, reaching under her skirt and pushing his fingers inside her.Biden is set to challenge Republican President Donald Trump, 73, in the Nov. 3 US election. Trump has been accused by more than a dozen women of sexual assault and misconduct over the years, allegations he and his aides have denied.“I think he should respond,” Trump said of Biden at a media briefing on Thursday. “It could be false accusations. I know all about false accusations.”Pelosi, who formally endorsed Biden for president on Monday, noted that staffers who ran Biden’s Senate office have said they had no recollection of a sexual assault complaint.“I have complete respect for the whole #MeToo movement,” Pelosi said at a news conference. “There is also due process and the fact that Joe Biden is Joe Biden.”“He is the personification of hope and optimism and authenticity for our country - a person of great values,” Pelosi added. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm Reade’s accusation and also was unable to reach Reade or a representative for her for comment.Several news outlets that have published Reade’s account, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, have interviewed a friend who said Reade told her about the alleged assault at the time. Another friend told the Times that Reade told her in 2008 about a previous traumatic incident involving Biden. Reade’s brother also confirmed parts of Reade’s account to The Intercept and the Post.On Monday, the Business Insider news website published an interview with a former neighbor who said Reade told her in the mid-1990s that Biden had put his fingers inside her.Reade, 56, told media interviewers she complained at the time about sexual harassment, though not sexual assault, to three of Biden’s Senate aides. The Biden campaign released a statement from one, Marianne Baker, who said she never received any report of inappropriate behavior in nearly 20 years of working for Biden.The Post and Times interviewed the other two aides, both of whom told the newspapers they had no recollection of Reade’s complaint.Reade was one of eight women who last year came forward to say Biden had hugged, kissed or touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable, though none accused him of sexual assault. Reade publicly accused him of the assault on a podcast in March.Some prominent Democratic women have stepped forward to defend Biden. Others have asked him to address the accusation.“It can’t appear that she’s being ignored just because it’s an inconvenient truth for certain people in the Democratic Party,” said Nina Turner, who was national campaign co-chair for the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders, who dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-give-first-interview-responding-to-sexual-assault-accusation/story-u6quKpNUkrpHqmMOvP5hTI.html
01-05-2020||World||Women, minorities and people of colour bear burden of front-line work during pandemic||As America tentatively emerges from weeks of lockdowns, the pandemic has taken its toll on workers who have been on the front lines all along.They have been packing and delivering supplies, caring for the sick and elderly, and keeping streets and buildings clean.They have also watched their co-workers fall ill. Thousands have gotten sick themselves. Many have died.The burden has been borne unevenly across gender, racial and socioeconomic lines, according to an Associated Press analysis of census data in the country’s 100 largest cities. They are mostly women, people of color and more likely to be immigrants.Workers deemed “essential” are also more likely to live below the federal poverty line or hover just above it. They are more likely to have children at home, and many live with others who also have front-line jobs.“What is important about this pandemic is that it has shined a spotlight on workers who have always been essential but before this were invisible,” said David Michaels, professor of environmental and occupational health at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University.A look at these workers:THE WAREHOUSE WORKERBorn homeless in New York City, Courtenay Brown is no stranger to hardship.She and her youngest sister both work an Amazon Fresh warehouse in New Jersey and share an apartment in Newark with six cats and a turtle. The sisters fought for their stable life, at one point living in Brown’s car for weeks until they saved enough for a security deposit and first month’s rent.When the pandemic took hold, Brown plunged into her job as a supervisor in the loading dock to get the $2 hourly pay bump and double overtime. Soon, several of her co-workers became infected. Others, she said, didn’t show up.More than 60% of warehouse and delivery workers in most cities are people of color, a figure that rises to more than 95% in Newark.One tough day, Brown pleaded with a co-worker to come to back for a day. The next day, exhausted and limping because of tendinitis, Brown couldn’t bear to come in herself. Her phone rang repeatedly that morning. She threw it across the room.“I thought, ‘this just isn’t worth it,’“ she said.THE GROCERY STORE WORKERJane St. Louis knows many of her customers after 27 years at a Safeway in Damascus, Maryland. Some have brought her cookies. Others have taken out their own fears of the virus on her, including one woman who yelled at her for not wearing gloves.Grocery employees have been among the most visible of America’s front-line workers as people rush to stock up on essentials. Nationwide, they are among the more diverse of front-line workers, split evenly between men and women. In most cities, more than 40% are white, 15% are black and 14% are Hispanic. At least 16% live below the federal poverty line and 15% lack health insurance.The virus has killed at least 30 members of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. Another 3,000 have either fallen ill or been quarantined for exposure, according to the union, which represents 900,000 people.When St. Louis gets home, her routine takes about an hour and starts in the garage, where she removes her shoes and changes into a bathrobe. She sprays the shoes with Lysol. The clothes go in the washing machine, as does her bathrobe after her shower.She doesn’t want to risk infecting her husband, a construction worker, and 15-year-old granddaughter, who lives with them.“I didn’t know I had anxiety until this started,” St. Louis said.THE TRUCK DRIVERJuan Giraldo and his wife nearly lost their home after he was laid off in the 2008 financial crisis. A refinancing deal saved him from foreclosure but left him tens of thousands of dollars deeper in debt.Now he feels he is sinking back into a familiar nightmare. A contract port truck driver in Los Angeles, Giraldo has seen work dry up as imports slow. He gets fewer than four hauls a week, compared with at least 12 in normal times. He used to make up to $3,500 a month but now earns about $1,500.More than 85% of warehouse and delivery workers in the Los Angeles area are people of color and 53% are foreign-born.Giraldo was raised in Colombia by his grandparents after his father left the war-torn country to work in the fruit groves of California. Giraldo followed in his early 20s, grateful to his father for paving the way but determined to be the kind of parent he never had.“I’m trying to change our history,” he said.As a contract worker, the father of four gets no paid sick leave and relies on California’s state health insurance program.“They are calling us heroes but it’s like they are sending us to World War II with wooden pistols,” Giraldo said.THE JANITORAnnette Brown’s job had been source of stability in a difficult life.For six years, the single mother of two has worked the overnight shift cleaning the second floor of a hospital in Halethorpe, Maryland.The outbreak has made her routine even tougher. She leaves her Baltimore apartment three hours before her shift starts and takes two buses. In the morning, she gets her 8-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son ready for remote schooling, cooks dinner and gets a few hours of sleep before starting over.The unionized job offers her paid sick days, a yearly raise and health insurance — a luxury in an industry where nearly 30% of workers lack it.She just never banked on finding herself working in a pandemic battleground. The hospital now treats COVID-19 patients, and Brown is terrified of going to her $14.70-an-hour job that barely keeps her family above the poverty line.“People are dropping like flies, and I don’t want it to happen to my family,” she said.Janitors are the most financially vulnerable front-line workers. In most cities, more than a quarter live below the poverty line. More than 40% are foreign-born and 74% are people of color.In Baltimore, nearly 75% of them are black. At least 90 members of Brown’s union, 32BJ SEIU, have died of the coronavirus. Another 20,000 have been laid off.Brown’s son tells her not to be afraid, saying: “Fear is nothing but the devil.”THE HEALTH CARE WORKERLinda Silva knew something was wrong when she started coughing on a Saturday in late March. The next day, the nurse’s assistant woke up with chest pain, a fever, a headache and a backache so bad it reminded her of labor pain. She tested positive for COVID-19 a week later.“That was before we realized we actually had COVID cases in our nursing home,” said Silva, who works at the Queens Nassau Nursing Center and the Beacon Rehab and Nursing Center in New York. “We didn’t have the right personal protective equipment at first.”About 75% of health care workers in most cities are women. They are among the front-line workers most likely to have access to health insurance, although 7% lack it. And more than 8% live below the federal poverty line.At least 54 nurses have died of the coronavirus, according to the American Nurses Association.Silva returned to work after recovering. It’s been more than a month since she has hugged her two sons or her husband, who is a building fire safety director.“We say we love each other daily and put our arms around our own selves in front of each other,” she said.THE TRAIN CONDUCTORDesmond Hill is a music writer who plays the flugelhorn, but he makes his living as a New York City subway conductor.His partner and five others he knows were among the more than 3,000 bus and subway workers who tested positive. Another 3,500, including Hill, were put on 14-day quarantine for exposure. Nearly 6,000 have returned to work.At least 83 New York City transit workers have died of the virus, according to the Metropolitan Transit Authority.In New York City, more than 45% of transit workers are black, 20% are white and 24% are Hispanic.“Sometimes you’re looking out on a train and think, ’who am I moving right now? I’m moving homeless people back and forth, why am I out here doing this?’” said Hill, who is back at work.Other times, Hill feels a sense of purpose.“There are also days you can see essential workers, people going to work at grocery stores, Target, hospitals. Those people get off the train and thank you,” he said. “It’s a back-and-forth struggle.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/women-minorities-and-people-of-colour-bear-burden-of-front-line-work-during-pandemic/story-GrdLvPN1lpBdDMXt3BmCCI.html

While the Chinese side in the video says it informed about the discovery of a new virus in January, the US didn’t take any note of it.The one minute 39 seconds video further shows China announcing its lockdown in January, and the US calling it barbaric. It also shows the US accusing China of human rights violation - more than once.The video ends with a jibe from the US that they are always correct “even though we contradict ourselves”. Once Upon a Virus... pic.twitter.com/FY0svfEKc6The video generated a lot of buzz on Twitter. Many users called China’s claims of warning ‘fake’ and ‘misleading.’ Others said this is more damaging to China. False propaganda from the Chinese ambassador to France, whitewashing over its government's deceptions and mocking U.S. objections to its human rights abuses. RTing so folks can see the Chinese government lying in real time -- https://t.co/yg3MX5S5ud This is more damaging to China.

Sharpening his rhetoric on Thursday, Trump said that his hard-fought trade deal with China was now of secondary importance to the coronavirus pandemic and he threatened new tariffs on Beijing, as his administration crafted retaliatory measures over the outbreak.The outburst against China reflected Trump’s growing frustration with Beijing over the pandemic, which has cost tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone, sparked an economic contraction and threatened his chances of re-election in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/once-upon-a-virus-china-mocks-us-with-video-on-covid-19-twitter-hits-back/story-em7NbeNp8Z7FGofGXosRkN.html
01-05-2020||World||Moderna signs deal for providing 1 billion Covid-19 doses a year||Moderna Inc., one of the leaders among US companies developing experimental vaccines against the coronavirus, entered a pact with Lonza Group AG aimed at manufacturing 1 billion doses a year.The companies announced a global agreement under which the Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical company will ramp up output of the proposed vaccine, which is based on a novel technology that relies on genetic material called mRNA. They expect the first batches to be produced in the US in July.The agreement is one of several partnerships being struck between drugmakers as they rush to bring protection against Covid-19 to the market. On Thursday, AstraZeneca Plc announced an agreement to make an experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford, eyeing production capacity for 100 million doses by the end of the year.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicBecause prospects for drugs to treat Covid-19 remain uncertain, rolling out vaccines on a widespread scale could be key to reopening economies from lockdowns. Otherwise new waves of infections could emerge, potentially on a seasonal pattern like the flu. If Moderna and Lonza reach their target of 1 billion doses a year, that would be enough for more than one-eighth of the world’s population.With dozens of projects under way around the world, the Trump administration wants to make shots available for Americans by the end of 2020. Richard Hatchett, head of the Oslo-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, has said cooperation between drugmakers could accelerate the process of bringing out a vaccine, which normally would take a year or more.New TechnologyModerna’s experimental shot induces the body’s own cells to make virus-like proteins that stimulate an immune response and prepare for an actual infection. It was one of the first proposed coronavirus vaccines to enter human trials. The company said it plans to begin the next phase of studies this quarter.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakThe pact with Lonza will enable a tenfold increase in manufacturing, which Moderna has already begun, according to a statement.Shares of Moderna, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have more than doubled since the start of the year as its studies of its vaccine candidate have advanced.The smaller players in the race won’t be able to produce a vaccine in large quantities on their own. Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc., another US biotech company in the first stage of testing an experimental vaccine, said Thursday that it agreed to expand a manufacturing collaboration with Germany’s Richter-Helm Biologics.A partnership between Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline Plc announced last month brought together a pair of pharmaceutical giants with manufacturing might. Sanofi will test its experimental coronavirus vaccine with Glaxo supplying so-called adjuvants, additional ingredients that improve efficacy and make it easier to produce shots in larger quantities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-signs-deal-for-providing-1-billion-covid-19-doses-a-year/story-w5nHVk0mjRl8XFhJK2QaHN.html
01-05-2020||World||Coronavirus pandemic could last beyond 2022, likely to continue in waves: Report||The coronavirus pandemic is likely to last as long as two years and won’t be controlled until about two-thirds of the world’s population is immune, a group of experts said in a report.Because of its ability to spread from people who don’t appear to be ill, the virus may be harder to control than influenza, the cause of most pandemics in recent history, according to the report from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. People may actually be at their most infectious before symptoms appear, according to the report.The HT Guide to Coronavirus Covid-19After locking down billions of people around the world to minimize its spread through countries, governments are now cautiously allowing businesses and public places to reopen. Yet the coronavirus pandemic is likely to continue in waves that could last beyond 2022, the authors said.“Risk communication messaging from government officials should incorporate the concept that this pandemic will not be over soon,” they said, “and that people need to be prepared for possible periodic resurgences of disease over the next two years.”Developers are rushing to make vaccines that may be available in small quantities as early as this year. While large amounts of vaccine against the 2009-2010 flu pandemic didn’t become available until after the outbreak peaked in the U.S., one study has estimated that the shots prevented as many as 1.5 million cases and 500 deaths in that country alone, the report said.Also read | Once upon a virus’: China mocks US with video on Covid-19, Twitter hits backThe report was written by CIDRAP director Michael Osterholm and medical director Kristen Moore, Tulane University public health historian John Barry, and Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health.WATCH | ‘Seen proof of Covid-19 link with Wuhan lab’: Donald Trump slams China||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-pandemic-could-last-beyond-2022-likely-to-continue-in-waves-report/story-uJYedKqlN3YS22rqRjspLO.html
01-05-2020||World||Pakistani parliament’s speaker tests positive for Covid-19||The speaker of Pakistan’s National Assembly said late on Thursday that he had tested positive for Covid-19, after hosting an iftar dinner to celebrate Ramadan, and meeting Prime Minister Imran Khan and other high officials earlier in the week.It is not immediately known if Khan will be tested, but he was checked in April, and tested negative, after meeting with the head of Pakistan’s biggest charity organisation, who was subsequently confirmed to have caught the disease.The National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, is currently in recess, though opposition parties have been calling for it to convene to discuss the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak in the country, where the number of cases has risen to 16,817, including 385 deaths.میرا کورونا وائرس کا ٹیسٹ مثبت آیا ہے۔ میں نے خود کو اپنے گھر میں قرنطینہ کر لیا ہے۔ میری پوری قوم سے درخواست ہے کہ وہ احتیاط کریں۔دعا کی درخواست ہے۔The decision on whether to convene rested with Speaker of the Assembly, Asad Qaiser, who on Thursday night revealed he had tested positive in the capital, Islamabad.“I have quarantined myself at home,” Qaiser, who is also a close aide to Khan, said on Twitter. Qaiser met with the prime minister on Monday, and has met several other leading figures during the past few days.The speaker had hosted an Iftar, the evening meal to break fast during Ramadan, attended by politicians and dignitaries on Monday.Daily detection of the virus has hit record highs on each of the last three days as the country ramps up its testing. On Thursday, 990 people tested positive. Daily testing is still around 8,000 in the country, which has over 207 million people.The government says infections are well below projections and that it plans to further ease precautionary curbs after already opening dozens of industries and commercial activities, as well as mosque congregations.Qaiser is the second high official to be infected in Pakistan after the Governor of the southern province of Sindh, Imran Ismail, tested positive on Monday.Pakistan’s government agreed to allow mosque congregations after senior clerics and religious leaders threatened to violate restrictions during Ramadan.The two sides worked out safety protocols for the mosque gatherings, but a social research organization earlier this week reported that protocols were not being followed. Prominent doctors pleaded with the government to reconsider the decision, warning that mosque congregations, which are typically larger in Ramadan, could lead to a spike in infections, with hospitals already nearing capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-parliament-s-speaker-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-OuifvIis2WJIQjew4Le6zH.html

The team subsequently told Pakistan to file requests for deletion of the names if the entry was “inappropriate”.Already, Islamabad has only confirmed that 19 of the 130 terrorists sanctioned by the UNSC are in Pakistan. Of these 19, it has requested UNSC to remove names of 6 terrorists.Diplomats in Delhi and New York told Hindustan Times that Pakistan’s hard push to improve its track record at the UNSC is grounded in the confidence that China will back its requests. “We have not been able to figure yet if the move is in consultation with Beijing but that would not be a surprise,” one of them said.Beijing had blocked an Indian-led international effort to designate chief of the Jaish-e-Mohammad terror group Masood Azhar as a global terrorist for years. Beijing eventually had to give in last year after the Jaish was implicated in the Pulwama bombing of 40 CRPF troopers that provoked India to launch air strikes at a terror training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot.China sought to make up to Pakistan for Masood Azhar’s terror tag by its support to Islamabad’s tit-for-tat effort to get four Indian professionals working in Afghanistan designated as terrorists under the UN Security Council’s 1267 Al Qaida sanctions. The four Indians were evacuated from Afghanistan by Indian security agencies over apprehensions that Pakistan could abduct them and claim to arrest them from its territory.Just as Islamabad had done with ex-Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav who was abducted from Iran and turned up in custody of Pakistani security agencies, the counter-terror operative said. Sentenced to death in a secret trial that India called “premeditated murder”, Jadhav is still in a Pakistan jail despite the International Court of Justice verdict last year that asked Islamabad to have the sentence “effectively” reviewed by an independent body.News of the attempt to prune the list of Pakistani terrorists sanctioned by the UNSC 1267 committee comes weeks after it emerged that Islamabad had been quietly removing names from its domestic terror watch list. On April 20, US tech firm Castellum.AI said Pakistan had removed nearly 3,800 names from the Proscribed Persons List that it had been maintaining. About 1,800 of these names were removed from the terror watch list after 9 March.Indian diplomats are convinced that the Pakistani effort to reduce the terror watch list is linked to the meeting of the terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force that was scheduled for June. It has now been deferred.At this meeting, the FATF had to assess the action taken by Pakistan to decide if it should continue to be in the grey list, be placed in the black list or be let off the hook. Islamabad has been in FATF’s grey list since 2018 for not doing enough to counter the raising of funds by al-Qaeda, Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.Since then, it has missed several deadlines to implement the action plan that it had committed to deliver on but has successfully evaded blacklisting. Diplomats in Delhi believe this has a lot to do with Beijing’s influence. That the FATF presidency has been with China’s Xiangmin Liu since 1 July 2019 also helped get away by doing less, one of them said.For instance, of the 19 names accepted by Pakistan to be on its soil, it has convicted only two - Lashkare-Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed and associate Malik Zafar Iqbal - ahead of the last FATF plenary in mid-March, an Indian official said. Besides, it has admitted that of the 222 cases filed in the country in such terror cases, only 60 were convicted and that too, for a few days each. Since the jail term is less than FATF’s prescribed minimum jail term (one year), it demonstrates a complete lack of seriousness to meet the FATF requirements, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-pak-s-push-to-delete-its-terrorists-from-unsc-list-china-s-support-is-key/story-OTTb65xlf8k5akNibrc2cP.html
01-05-2020||World||Forbidden City, parks in Beijng reopen to public as covid crisis eases||Beijing’s parks and museums including the ancient Forbidden City reopened to the public Friday after being closed for months by the coronavirus pandemic.The Forbidden City, past home to China’s emperors, is allowing just 5,000 visitors daily, down from 80,000. And parks are allowing people to visit at 30% of the usual capacity.Large-scale group activities remain on hold and visitors must book tickets in advance online, according to Gao Dawei, deputy director of the Beijing Gardening and Greening Bureau.Beijing on Thursday downgraded its level of emergency response to the virus from first to second tier, but temperature checks and social distancing remain in force.The change comes at the start of the five-day May 1 holiday and in advance of China’s rescheduled gathering of the National People’s Congress on May 22.The sessions were delayed from early March. The two-week annual meetings are largely ceremonial, with the legislature rubber-stamping decisions reached earlier by Communist Party leaders, but in typical years they are a colorful spectacle in the nation’s capital.It’s not yet clear if the 3,000 or so delegates would come to Beijing, or if sessions would be held virtually through videoconference.China on Friday reported 12 new cases of the virus, six of them brought from overseas, and no new deaths for the 16th day. It has reported a total of 4,633 deaths from the virus among about 83,000 cases, mostly in the central city of Wuhan.Most recent cases reported in China have been among travelers arriving from abroad or in a northeastern province near the border with Russia.Across the country, 599 patients remain under treatment for the virus. Just under 1,000 people are under medical observation because they tested positive but don’t show symptoms or have symptoms but testing hasn’t confirmed the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/forbidden-city-parks-in-beijng-reopen-to-public-as-covid-crisis-eases/story-uZyP3XFEUxbNGIMvCf4a0J.html

01-05-2020||World||3.8 million more in US apply for jobless aid||More than 3.8 million laid-off workers applied for unemployment benefits last week as the US economy slid further into a crisis that is becoming the most devastating since the 1930s.Roughly 30.3 million people have now filed for jobless aid in the six weeks since the coronavirus outbreak began forcing millions of employers to close their doors and slash their workforces. That is more people than live in the New York and Chicago metropolitan areas combined, and it’s by far the worst string of layoffs on record. It adds up to more than one in six American workers.With more employers cutting payrolls to save money, economists have forecast that the unemployment rate for April could go as high as 20%. That would be the highest rate since it reached 25% during the Great Depression.Some outside reviews suggest that the number of job losses is likely even higher than is captured in the weekly unemployment claims. A poll by two academic economists, Alexander Bick and Adam Blandin, found that the US economy may have lost 34 million jobs since mid-March, when the coronavirus shutdowns began.A key reason for that emerges from a survey by the Economic Policy Institute. It found that up to 12 million more people have lost jobs but haven’t filed a claim for benefits, either because they couldn’t get through their state’s overwhelmed system or they didn’t try, perhaps because it was too difficult.“These findings imply the official count of unemployment insurance claims likely drastically understates the extent of employment reductions,” wrote Ben Zipperer and Elise Gould, economists at EPI.This week, the government estimated that the economy shrank at a 4.8% annual rate in the first three months of this year, the sharpest quarterly drop since the 2008 financial crisis. Yet the picture is likely to grow far worse: The economy is expected to contract in the April-June quarter by as much as 40% at an annual rate. No previous quarter has been anywhere near as weak since the government began keeping such records after World War II.States have approved the jobless benefit applications of nearly 18 million people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-8-million-more-in-us-apply-for-jobless-aid/story-6bEXgSMrlZhpMWCKn6MpVI.html

01-05-2020||World||‘Remarkable example: UN chief says world should follow South Korea on Covid-19 fight||The United Nations chief said he hopes many countries in the world will follow the “remarkable example” of South Korea, which he said has been “extremely successful” in addressing the coronavirus pandemic and is planning to tackle climate change in its recovery from COVID-19.Secretary-General Antonio Guterres pointed to Thursday’s announcement “that there was no new case in the Republic of Korea,” the country’s official name.At the same time, he said, South Korea has presented plans for “a very ambitious green deal” for its recovery from the pandemic, including a ban on new coal-fired plants and a reduction of emissions from existing coal-fired plants.“We hope that this example of the Republic of Korea will be followed by many other countries in the world,” Guterres said at a news conference.The Koreas Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement early Thursday that four cases in the previous 24 hours, all imported, took the country’s total to 10,765, with 247 deaths and 9,059 recoveries.South Korea’s caseload has been slowing in recent weeks after it recorded hundreds of new cases every day between late February and early March. It has subsequently relaxed some of its social distancing guidelines and is expected to ease up on more restrictions in the coming days if the downward trend continues.South Korea had its first confirmed coronavirus case Jan. 20, the same day as the United States.But unlike the U.S., officials there used a test focused on the same gene targets as the World Health Organization’s recommended test, according to the website of a test manufacturer. The government then quickly allowed private sector labs to produce it.As a result, a nation with less than one-sixth the population of the United States mobilized to test more than 20,000 people a day. South Korea also instituted drive-through testing centers, allowing quicker identification of those who were infected but might not be displaying symptoms, thus slowing the emergence of new cases to a more manageable level.By comparison, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decided to develop its own test, focusing on three gene targets distinct from what the WHO used. The test was reportedly flawed and according to CDC data only 472 patients had been tested nationwide on Feb. 29, with just 22 cases confirmed.The result was that while South Korea was able to manage its caseload, the rate of U.S. infections soared.Guterres said recovery from the pandemic “needs to go hand-in-hand with climate action,” just as South Korea is doing now.He called on governments to ensure that spending to revitalize their economies gives priority to the creation of “green jobs” and use of low-carbon energy sources.“Taxpayers’ money should not be used to subsidize fossil fuels or bail out polluting, carbon-intensive industries,” the U.N. chief said. “Now is the time to put a price on carbon and for polluters to pay for their pollution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remarkable-example-un-chief-says-world-should-follow-south-korea-on-covid-19-fight/story-WojyJDZIucGctjMeL2HdvN.html

We have an obligation to the American people to do our best to make sure that we fix that, that we prevent those things from ever happening again,” he said.Meanwhile, several Republican lawmakers demanding a Congressional hearing alleged that the WHO parroted the Chinese regime’s “disinformation” on multiple occasions, including denying human-to-human transmission of the virus.They alleged the WHO prolonged declaring Covid-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, chastised efforts to restrict travel, and continued to praise China as a global leader in public health despite mounting evidence to the contrary.“The WHO’s inaction and delay undoubtedly cost American lives. For these reasons, we commend the President’s decision to temporarily pause the WHO’s funding,” the lawmakers said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Congressman James Comer, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on The Environment, said it would be an utter failure of the Committee to not investigate the WHO’s failures to address the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic and its effect on the American people.

Guterres was responding to a question on whether any UN official had spoken to any North Korean official about the health and whereabouts of Kim. “We have no information about the situation of Kim Jong Un,” Guterres said during a virtual press briefing.

01-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Top US airlines make face masks mandatory throughout trips||Delta Air Lines Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc. have decided to make passengers wear face masks, adding momentum to what’s catching on as a new standard for the industry as it fights to win back customers during a pandemic.The larger carriers are following JetBlue Airways Corp., which announced April 27 that travelers would have to cover their nose and mouth throughout trips starting May 4. Delta‘s mandate starts the same day, with American’s kicking in on May 11. Small children are exempt.The requirement is meant to help soothe concerns that aircraft cabins foster the spread of Covid-19. All three airlines cited guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in implementing the change. The coverings help prevent anyone who may be unknowingly infected with the new coronavirus from spreading it in a confined space like an airplane cabin.“We take seriously the CDC guidelines for adding this extra layer of protection,” Bill Lentsch, Delta’s chief customer experience officer, said in a statement Thursday. “We believe this change will give customers and employees some additional comfort when traveling with us.”While neither have issued a decree, United Airlines Holdings Inc. said it’s strongly encouraging the coverings, and Southwest Airlines Co. said it will provide masks to those who want them.The union representing flight attendants from 20 airlines welcomed the new rule, and urged for it to be expanded.The Association of Flight Attendants wants the federal government to mandate “masks for crew, front line employees and all passengers,” said Sara Nelson, president of the group.Lobby, TooMasks will be compulsory just on board American flights, while Delta and JetBlue are requiring them starting in the check-in lobby, gate areas, jet bridges as well as during flights.American will begin making masks and hand sanitizing wipes or gel available to some passengers on Friday, expanding to all flights as it’s able, the Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier said. Masks made at home from cloth or other household items can be used, it said.United, Delta and American already require some employees to wear face masks, or will do so soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-top-us-airlines-make-face-masks-mandatory-throughout-trips/story-cvrHapHskLWpHWOzkYprvK.html

Biden is the presumptive nominee of the opposition Democratic party.“China doesn’t want to see me elected and the reason is that we are getting billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars a month from China,” Trump said, referring to the massive tariffs he has imposed on the import of Chinese products into the US.“China never gave our country anything...whether it was Biden in charge of China which was a joke because they ripped off our country for eight years and in all fairness to Biden and (former US President Barack) Obama, this went on long before they got into office,” he said.“I mean, you can go through many administrations until I came along and then we find a trade deal where they are supposed to buy and they have been buying a lot actually.

None of the protesters appeared to be wearing masks.“Directly above me, men with rifles yelling at us,” tweeted Senator Dayna Polehanki along with a photo showing four men, at least one of whom appeared to be carrying a weapon.“Some of my colleagues who own bullet proof vests are wearing them. I have never appreciated our Sergeants-at-Arms more than today,” she continued.More protesters could be seen outside carrying signs, including one depicting Governor Gretchen Whitmer as Adolf Hitler.The demonstration, dubbed the American Patriot Rally, was organized by a group calling itself Michigan United for Liberty.“We do not agree with or consent to our unalienable rights being restricted or rescinded for any reason, including the COVID-19 pandemic,” the group said on its private Facebook page, where it has more than 8,800 members.“We believe that every American and every Michigander has the right to work to support our families, to travel freely, to gather for religious worship and for other purposes, to gather in protest of our government and to direct our own medical care.”The protest comes a day after a Michigan court ruled that stay-at-home directives issued by Whitmer on March 24 do not infringe on residents’ constitutional rights, according to local media reports.It was the second time this month that protesters have demanded Whitmer lift lockdown restrictions in the state, which has seen more than 3,500 people killed by the coronavirus, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.On April 16 around 3,000 protesters, some of them also armed, descended on Lansing for “Operation Gridlock,” causing a massive traffic jam around the capital building.A day later Trump appeared to lend his support to them and scattered protests elsewhere, tweeting “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!”Whitmer, whose name has emerged as a potential running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, shrugged those protests off, telling CNN it was “OK to be angry.”“I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again -- Michigan is an extraordinary place to live because of the people who call it home. There are millions of Michiganders doing their part to slow the spread of #COVID19 every single day. We are going to get through this together,” she tweeted later Thursday, without commenting directly on the protests.Despite the demonstrations, Whitmer’s handling of the virus crisis has been met with a generally favorable response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-armed-us-protesters-enter-michigan-capitol-demand-lockdown-end/story-AxFqblSSOpH2Zc3tY1hlTN.html
01-05-2020||World||Donald Trump says evidence ties China lab to coronavirus, threatens tariffs||US President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened China with fresh tariffs as he stepped up his attacks on Beijing over the coronavirus crisis, saying he had seen evidence linking a Wuhan lab to the contagion.The diatribe from the Republican incumbent came as data showed the United States shed more than 30 million jobs in six weeks, as lockdown measures began to bite across the nation.The gloom in the world’s largest economy found its parallel across the Atlantic, where experts warned of an unprecedented financial catastrophe in Europe.The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has so far killed more than 230,000 people and forced more than half of humanity to live under some kind of lockdown, which has crippled economies.The virus is believed to have originated late last year in a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that sold wild animals for human consumption, but speculation has swirled about a top-secret lab in the ground-zero city.Asked if he had seen anything giving him a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the source of the outbreak, Trump replied, “Yes, I have.”Pressed by reporters at the White House for details on what made him so confident, Trump replied: “I cannot tell you that.”Trump is increasingly making Beijing’s handling of the outbreak a major issue for his November re-election campaign.When asked about reports that he could cancel US debt obligations to China, Trump said he could “do it differently” and act in “probably a little bit more of a forthright manner.”“I could do the same thing but even for more money, just putting on tariffs,” he said.Despite a truce in the long-running trade war between Washington and Beijing reached in January, tariffs are already in place on two-thirds of trade between the economic powers.- Eurozone gloom -European and US markets finished the day in negative territory, as a spate of figures confirmed fears about how the COVID-19 crisis is pulverizing global growth.The latest jobless claims by another 3.84 million Americans translate into a jarring conclusion -- roughly nine percent of the US population has filed for unemployment benefits in six weeks.In the midwestern US state of Michigan, protesters -- some of them armed -- stormed the state capitol building, demanding that the Democratic governor remove strict lockdown rules, which they say hurt the economy and represent governmental overreach.The depressing US jobs data compounded the tough message from European Central Bank Christine Lagarde.“The euro area is facing an economic contraction of a magnitude and speed that are unprecedented in peacetime,” she warned.ECB economists expect output in the 19-nation currency club to shrink by “five to 12 percent” this year, she added.Eurostat figures showed the eurozone economy was estimated to have shrunk by 3.8 percent in the first quarter.Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, “will experience the worst recession in the history of the federal republic” -- founded in 1949 -- Economy Minister Peter Altmaier warned, predicting it would shrink by a record 6.3 percent.- Drug trial boosts hopes -The coronavirus virus has infected at least 3.2 million people so far, with Russia’s Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin becoming the latest high-profile figure to test positive as the country’s caseload surged past 100,000.But there was some reason for cheer.American scientists reported positive tests for an improved treatment, and with deaths and infections starting to drop in some hotspots, countries looked at the next phase in their plans to lift crippling lockdown measures.On Thursday, Germany accelerated plans to start lifting its anti-virus lockdown, preparing to ease curbs on public life and reopen religious institutions, museums and zoos -- having restarted shopping last week.A decision on when to reopen schools is to come next week.“It remains absolutely important that we stay disciplined,” said Chancellor Angela Merkel.In South Korea, where COVID-19 was detected in mid-February, no new infections were reported for the first time, suggesting its aggressive test-and-trace strategy is working. South Korea’s death toll is around 250 -- vastly lower than that of Italy, Britain, Spain and France, which have each recorded at least 24,000 fatalities. The United States tops the table with more than 62,000 deaths.Italy, once the world center of the outbreak, said Thursday it was hoping to reopen two major airports next week, but -- like Spain -- plans a cautious reopening.“We cannot allow the efforts made to be in vain because of rashness at this delicate stage,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who himself battled COVID-19, said the country was “past the peak” of its outbreak.- ‘Clear-cut effect’ - Meanwhile, in the first evidence of successful treatment, a US clinical trial of the drug remdesivir showed that patients recovered about 30 percent faster than those on a placebo.“The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,” said Anthony Fauci, the top epidemiologist in the United States.But it is a treatment, not the much-sought-after vaccine that might allow a full return to normal life. More than 130 virus therapies are currently being investigated, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations said Thursday.Most are still in the early stages of testing, but more than 25 clinical trials have begun, IFPMA director Thomas Cueni said. burs-sst/ec||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-evidence-ties-china-lab-to-coronavirus-threatens-tariffs/story-umlIzx5fIMjOXkWKTU0uPJ.html
01-05-2020||World||Dead virus particles may affect test result||Coronavirus patients who remain positive weeks after diagnosis may harbour dead virus particles that can’t be distinguished from infectious ones in tests, scientists in South Korea found.The virus dies one to two weeks after infecting and proliferating inside respiratory cells, doctors at the National Medical Center in Seoul said. Pieces of the virus’s RNA may remain in cells and be detected by a nucleic acid test a month or two after infection, underscoring the limitation of Covid-19 testing, they said.Some Covid-19 patients have continued to test positive over more than a month, said Peter Collignon, a professor of clinical medicine at the Australian National University Medical School in Canberra. It’s possible that the virus detected in these patients isn’t viable or capable of causing an infection, “but we need better animal models to see if it’s dead or alive,” he said. How long an individual excretes infectious virus in their respiratory secretions and faecal matter is key to determining the optimal time an infected person should self-isolate or be quarantined. Previous studies indicate that very ill patients remain infectious longer than people who experience a mild illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dead-virus-particles-may-affect-test-result/story-KwnqDfVCiutYbJFr2NiDUM.html
01-05-2020||World||World may see unprecedented 8% fall in CO2 emissions: IEA||The coronavirus lockdown will cause the biggest drop in energy demand in history -the equivalent of the entire energy demand of India - with only renewables managing to increase output through the crisis. As people around the world consume less oil, gas and coal, electricity generated from the wind and sun will keep flowing, resulting in an unprecedented 8% decline in global carbon dioxide emissions this year, according to a report from the International Energy Agency (IEA). “The energy industry that emerges from this crisis will be significantly different from the one that came before,” Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, said in a statement released on Thursday.The pandemic has infected at least 3.2mn people worldwide and killed more than 229,000. With no drug to treat Covid-19 and a vaccine not expected until at least the end of the year, reducing the interactions between infected people is the only effective way to control the spread.Those measures, however, have severe impact on economic growth and energy demand. Each month of lockdown on the scale of what’s in place this month reduces annual energy demand by 1.5%, the IEA estimates.The institution says demand is likely to fall 6% in 2020, which is seven times the scale of the drop suffered in the 2008 financial crisis. Rich countries will show a steeper decline, with the US falling 9% and the EU losing 11%.While all sources of energy - oil, coal, natural gas and nuclear - will see a decline, renewable energy is likely to be the bright spot. And though emissions will fall drastically, the IEA expects a sharp rebound without government policies pushing for a green recovery. With fossil-fuel use taking a big hit, it’s no surprise that emissions will fall. An 8% decline is larger than most early estimates, and bigger than what the most ambitious scenario to keep global warming under check demands. Yet, that decline probably is not enough to hold off further increases in the earth’s temperature or the stock of greenhouse gases that have built up in the atmosphere, the IEA said. The more ambitious target set under the Paris climate agreement - keeping temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius - will require halving annual global emissions by 2030 and hitting net-zero emissions sometime around the middle of the century. Without deep structural changes, emissions are expected to rise again when economies recover.“Governments can learn from that experience by putting clean energy technologies at the heart of their plans for economic recovery,” Birol said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-may-see-unprecedented-8-fall-in-co2-emissions-iea/story-2Kj35kMSaD2Kbbau0VSnnI.html
