The use of the Underground and trains during the pandemic has dropped substantially in London.The plan to quarantine visitors sparked a row with the opposition Labour and critics demanding why thousands have been allowed into the UK without checks so far in previous months. The airlines industry warned of a crippling effect of the measure.Lisa Nandy, shadow foreign secretary, said she had raised the issue of quarantine five times to prevent a resurgence of cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cycle-to-work-is-new-uk-mantra-as-covid-19-toll-crosses-31-500/story-vZR1KBvfiSWF3h8WLL5qeM.html

A personal military valet to the president, who and other valets work closely with the president and the first family, had tested positive on Thursday.A personal aide to Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and adviser, has also tested positive, according to news reports that pointed out said she has been teleworking from home and not been around the first daughter for weeks. Both Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, were tested on Friday and they were both negative.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe president and the vice-president are now being tested for the virus every day and the White House sought assure Americans every precaution is being taken to prevent the virus from spreading. “This is the safest place you can come to,” White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters.The White House has sad that every staff member working in close proximity to the president and the vice-president is being tested daily, in addition to the enforcement of social distancing, daily temperature checks and symptom histories, and the use of hand sanitizers and regular deep cleaning of all work spaces.Nearly 1.3 million people have contracted the coronavirus in the the United States with 26,960 new infections in the last 24 hours only and the 77,180 hav died of it, up by 1,518.President Trump is optimistic it will be over soon. He told reporters at a meeting with Republican lawmakers that the virus “This is going to go away without a vaccine. It’s going to go away, and it’s -- we’re not going to see it again, hopefully, after a period of time.”“You may have some -- some flare-ups and I guess, you know, I would expect that,” he added. “Sometime in the fall, you’ll have flare-ups maybe.”The American president has previously said a vaccine is likely by the end of the year, though medical experts on his coronavirus task force have been a little more circumspect and suggested January or later.But the president’s optimism is in line with his earlier remarks that the epidemic will be gone like a “miracle”, which were attributed initially to his reluctance to acknowledge the gravity of the crisis and, then, once he finally did, with mounting infections and fatalities, his eagerness to reopen the country.The infections at the White House, have however, raised questions about the workplace safety around the country as businesses reopen. The White House may have added to these uncertainties by blocking the release of reopening guidelines put together by the government’s top medical experts.(For print) And amid rising tensions with China on the coronavirus outbreak, the United States on Friday cut visa period for Chinese journalists to 90 days, with the option of extending it. The two countries have been engaged in a series of retaliatory actions against journalists in recent months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/second-white-house-covid-19-infection-raises-questions-about-workplace-safety/story-JcQfksNLIUX3WwE2b8tXfM.html
09-05-2020||World||After months of no checks, UK mulls quarantine for visitors||A row erupted on Saturday after it was revealed that the Boris Johnson government is considering quarantining all visitors for 14 days from May-end, with the opposition Labour and critics demanding why thousands have been allowed in without checks so far.The airlines industry warned of a debilitating effect of the measure. Ministers and health officials previously claimed checking and quarantining visitors had a marginal effect, but the new plan led many to demand why now, after over 31,000 people have died in the UK.Under the plan, people who arrive at airports, ports and Eurostar railway stations will be asked to provide the address they will self-isolate for two weeks upon arrival by filling out a digital form. Those from Ireland, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man are to be exempted.Lisa Nandy, shadow foreign secretary, said she had raised the issue of quarantine five times to prevent a resurgence of cases. Tens of thousands of people on flights from China and elsewhere have arrived in the past three months, without checks or quarantine.Johnson is due to announce “modest” relaxation in lockdown measures on Sunday evening, but leaks in the British media suggest quarantine is one of the measures being considered to prevent a second peak of coronavirus. According to Johnson, the UK is past its first peak.Bodies representing airlines awaited details of the quarantine plan, but Airlines UK said: “This proposal would effectively kill international travel to and from the UK and cause immeasurable damage to the aviation industry and wider UK economy”.“Nobody is going to go on holiday if they’re not able to resume normal life for 14 days, and business travel would be severely restricted. It will also make it all but impossible for aviation to resume any time soon, thereby setting back the UK’s economic recovery still further.”Karen Dee of the Airport Operators Association, said the plan would “not only have a devastating impact on the UK aviation industry, but also on the wider economy…There should be a clear exit strategy and the economic impact on key sectors should be mitigated”.The number of virus-stricken patients in hospitals has been dwindling in recent days, particularly in the worst affected area of London. The dead include a six-week-old baby and 614 people categorised as ‘British Indian’ by NHS England.---||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-months-of-no-checks-uk-mulls-quarantine-for-visitors/story-TLrwhp1hVWL8BEzMo2TlZL.html
09-05-2020||World||Britain to quarantine travellers for 14 days, UK airlines association says||The British government has told airlines it will introduce a 14-day quarantine period for most people arriving from abroad to try to avoid a second peak of the coronavirus pandemic, an association representing the airlines said on Saturday.Airlines UK, which represents British Airways, Easyjet and other British airlines, said the move required “a credible exit plan” and should be reviewed weekly. Airport operators said it could have a “devastating” impact on the aviation industry and the broader economy.The quarantine plan was first reported by The Times newspaper, which said Prime Minister Boris Johnson would on Sunday announce that passengers arriving at airports and ports, including Britons returning from abroad, will have to self-isolate for a fortnight.Under measures that are likely to come into force in early June, travellers will have to provide the address at which they will self-isolate on arrival, The Times said.“These measures will help protect the British public and reduce the transmission of the virus as we move into the next phase of our response,” The Times quoted a government source as saying.Johnson’s Downing Street office and the interior ministry declined comment. Johnson is due on Sunday to announce the next steps in Britain’s battle to tackle the novel coronavirus following a review by ministers of measures that have all but shut the economy and kept millions at home for more than six weeks.The airport operators said a quarantine would compound damage done by the pandemic to the aviation industry as it would put people off travelling when lockdown restrictions are lifted.“Quarantine would not only have a devastating impact on the UK aviation industry, but also on the wider economy,” said Karen Dee, Chief Executive of the Airport Operators Association.“If the government believes quarantine is medically necessary, then it should be applied on a selective basis following the science, there should be a clear exit strategy and the economic impact on key sectors should be mitigated.”SPOT CHECKS AND FINESAirlines UK said it would seek assurances that the move is “led by the science” and that airlines would need support measures to ensure the aviation sector gets through the quarantine period. The Times report said travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man would be exempt from the quarantine, as would lorry drivers bringing crucial supplies.It said the authorities would carry out spot checks and those found to be breaking the rules would face fines or deportation.Britain has reported 31,241 deaths from the coronavirus and environment minister George Eustice said Johnson would not announce any dramatic changes to Britain’s lockdown on Sunday.The devolved Welsh government announced minor lockdown adjustments on Friday, allowing people to exercise more than once a day and garden centres to reopen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-to-quarantine-travellers-for-14-days-uk-airlines-association-says/story-3BVUVf44xBSsqTA3ctapsJ.html
09-05-2020||World||China admits coronavirus exposed ‘shortcomings’ in healthcare system||The coronavirus outbreak exposed “shortcomings” in China’s public healthcare system, a top health official admitted Saturday, saying that reforms are underway to improve the country’s disease prevention and control mechanisms.China has faced criticism both at home and abroad for downplaying the virus and concealing information about the outbreak when it first emerged in the central city of Wuhan in December.The virus has since infected nearly four million people worldwide -- claiming more than 270,000 lives -- and crippled the global economy.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageBeijing has insisted it has always shared information with the World Health Organization and other countries in a timely manner.But on Saturday Li Bin, deputy director of China’s National Health Commission, made a rare admission when he said the healthcare system had not been adequately prepared, which had left holes in China’s response.“The novel coronavirus outbreak was a big test that revealed China still has shortcomings in its major epidemic prevention and control system, public health systems and other aspects of responding (to an emergency),” Li told reporters at a press briefing.China’s health authority will build a “centralised, unified and efficient” leadership system that would allow it to respond more quickly and effectively to any public health crisis in the future, Li said.Officials were also discussing how to “modernise” the disease control and prevention system by using big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and other technologies that will help to predict outbreaks more accurately and enhance preparedness, Li said. The commission was also considering ways to revise public health laws, strengthen international exchanges and “actively participate in global health governance,” Li added.On Friday Beijing said it would support a World Health Organization-led review into the global response to the coronavirus outbreak -- once the pandemic is over.The comments came after US President Donald Trump ramped up criticism of China this week, saying the virus “could have been stopped in China.”Although it was the first epicentre of the pandemic, China has not reported any coronavirus related deaths for 24 consecutive days, and the country is gradually reopening schools and urging workers to return to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-admits-coronavirus-exposed-shortcomings-in-healthcare-system/story-XJDrA7gWjzPz2MKmUuz7hI.html

The Army on Friday said in a statement that a vehicle of paramilitary Frontier Corps was targeted through a remote-controlled improvised explosive device (IED) in Kech district’s Buleda area, about 14 km from the Iran border.“A major and five soldiers were killed while one soldier was injured,” according to the Army.No one took responsibility but Baloch militants often target the security forces in the province.Security sources said the route where the explosion took place was monitored round the clock because of suspected movement by smugglers and insurgents in the border area.A search operation was launched by the security forces in the area to trace the elements involved in the attack.It is the first major attack on the forces in Balochistan since the outbreak of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-army-major-among-6-security-personnel-killed-in-roadside-bomb-attack/story-rzDRhiPICnTLYCPgcz2yyI.html
09-05-2020||World||Covid-19 crisis fuels historic US job losses, Europe wants borders kept shut||The United States recorded its steepest job losses in history over the coronavirus pandemic as Europe moved to keep its borders shut for another month.Hopes have been rising that the worst of the global catastrophe, which has killed more than 270,000 people, has passed, and the United States on Friday approved a new at-home saliva test to speed up diagnosis for Covid-19.But after weeks of lockdown across the world, the effects have been painfully visible, with the global economy suffering its most acute downturn in nearly a century.In the United States, 20.5 million jobs were wiped out in April -- the most ever reported -- with unemployment rising to 14.7 percent, the highest since the Great Depression.The world’s largest economy has suffered the deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with more than 77,000 fatalities and nearly 1.3 million cases.Mindful of elections in November, President Donald Trump has nonetheless vowed to reopen the country, and a growing number of state governors have already let business resume with precautions.Trump played down the unemployment numbers, pointing to substantial gains Friday on global stock markets as proof that better times were ahead.“We’re going to have a phenomenal year next year,” Trump told reporters. “I think it’s going to come back blazing.”His optimism came even as the virus spread within the White House, with the press secretary of Vice President Mike Pence testing positive.Neighbouring Canada also shed three million jobs, bringing its unemployment rate up to 13.1 percent, two days after the European Union forecast a massive recession in the bloc.Disinfecting drones In India, drones sprayed disinfectant on the streets of Ahmedabad on Saturday, hours after security forces clashed with residents who flouted a toughened lockdown.The western city has become a coronavirus hotspot and a major concern for authorities as they battle a surge in deaths and infections.The tougher measures in India come as a number of governments around the world are moving to ease restrictions.Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, took decisive early action that stemmed the virus and Chancellor Angela Merkel plans an almost complete return to normal within the month.Italy, where deaths on Friday passed 30,000, plans to allow worshippers to return to church, while Denmark said cinemas, museums and zoos would reopen on June 8.In Britain, which has suffered the highest death toll after the United States, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to offer a roadmap out of lockdown on Sunday.The European Commission meanwhile recommended that the 27-nation bloc extend its ban on the non-essential entry of visitors until June 15.“The situation remains fragile both in Europe and in the world,” it said in a statement.The virus that has infected 3.9 million people worldwide overshadowed one of the most important dates on the European calendar -- the anniversary of the end of World War II on the continent.Parades and commemorations to mark 75 years since Nazi Germany’s surrender were canceled or scaled down Friday.Russia, which marks the occasion a day later than western Europe, Saturday held muted celebrations after becoming Europe’s hotspot in the coronavirus pandemic.A Red Square parade was postponed and President Vladimir Putin instead gave a speech at a war memorial inside the Kremlin walls.He made no mention of the coronavirus but hinted at the struggle Russians are facing against the pandemic.“Our veterans fought for life, against death. And we will always be equal to their unity and endurance,” Putin said.No unity at UN Far from bringing the world together, the crisis has triggered a war of words between China, where the virus first appeared in the metropolis of Wuhan, and the United States, where Trump has battled criticism over his handling of the epidemic.The Trump administration has brought into the mainstream a theory that the virus came from a Wuhan laboratory, despite the World Health Organization and the top US epidemiologist saying there is no evidence.China rejects the charge, and America’s allies are not convinced.The feud spread Friday to the UN Security Council, where the US, stunning other members, prevented a vote on a resolution that called for a ceasefire in various conflicts around the world to allow governments to better address the pandemic among those suffering most.Diplomats said Washington was concerned about language in the resolution on the role of the World Health Organization, which has been at the forefront of confronting Covid-19.Trump has vowed to freeze the more than $400 million in annual US funding for the UN body, saying it did not act quickly enough when the mysterious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan and blindly took the word of China.The US State Department on Friday also accused China and Russia of sharply escalating disinformation online about the virus, including promoting conspiracy theories that it was cooked up by US scientists.Home tests Researchers in Hong Kong have found that patients suffering milder illness caused by the coronavirus recover more quickly if they are treated with a three-drug antiviral cocktail soon after symptoms appear.Authors of the study, published in the Lancet on Friday, called for larger-scale research to ascertain if the drug combo could be a viable treatment for critically-ill patients.With the US death toll and infections still climbing, regulators on Friday offered a way to ramp up testing -- a significantly simpler home diagnostic kit that uses saliva.Public health workers warn that a complete return to normal is impossible until the development of a vaccine, which could take months if not longer.Trump, however, has suggested that a vaccine is not a prerequisite to ending the pandemic.“At some point it will probably go away by itself,” he told reporters, while adding: “If we had a vaccine, that would be very helpful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-crisis-fuels-historic-us-job-losses-europe-wants-borders-kept-shut/story-LN05Qd44NMokGHr15gJF6K.html

Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner both tested negative on Friday, the person familiar with the matter told the US news channel. The development comes a day after President Trump confirmed that Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary Katie Miller had tested positive for the coronavirus.“She’s a wonderful young woman, Katie, she tested very good for a long period of time and then all of a sudden today she tested positive,” Trump said during a meeting at the White House.He said Miller had not come into contact with him but spent some time with Pence.One of Trump’s personal valets tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday.Following the news of the valet’s illness, Trump said he would be tested for the coronavirus daily.According to a senior official, contact tracing was performed inside the White House after Miller’s test came positive.The White House is now making sure staffers wear masks in the White House residence, and coronavirus tests and temperature checks are being boosted throughout the West Wing. The West Wing is also being sanitised on a more frequent basis, the official said.Pence, who leads the White House coronavirus task force, recently went on a trip to the Mayo Clinic without wearing a face mask, despite being told about the clinic’s policy saying they’re required.Trump also declined to wear a mask this week during portions of his tour of a mask-making facility in Arizona.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ivanka-trump-s-personal-assistant-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/story-JiREHIrA0UStKqi41DGCxN.html
09-05-2020||World||Trump admin working to temporarily ban work-based visas: Report||The US is working to temporarily ban the issuance of some work-based visas like H-1B, popular among highly-skilled Indian IT professionals, as well as students visas and work authorisation that accompanies them, amidst the high level of unemployment due to the coronavirus, according to a media report on Friday.The H-1B is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers from countries like India and China in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.Nearly 500,000 migrant workers are employed in the US in the H-1B status.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“The president’s immigration advisers are drawing up plans for a coming executive order, expected this month, that would ban the issuance of some new temporary, work-based visas,” The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. “The order is expected to focus on visa categories including H-1B, designed for highly skilled workers, and H-2B, for seasonal migrant workers, as well as student visas and the work authorization that accompanies them,” it said. More than 33 million Americans have lost their jobs in the last two months due to the coronavirus pandemic that has brought the US economy to a standstill. The IMF and the World Bank have projected a negative growth rate for the country. White House officials say that the US economy is likely to grow at negative 15 to 20 per cent in the second quarter.The monthly jobs report on Friday said that the unemployment rate in the US for the month of April rose to 14.7 per cent. This is the highest rate and the largest over-the-month increase in the history of the series, seasonally adjusted data are available back to January 1948, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics said.As such, the Trump administration, having temporarily closed borders and curtailed immigration in response to the coronavirus pandemic, is moving to expand those restrictions while the president’s advisers push to leave them in place for months or even years to come, according to several people familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal reported.Last month, President Donald Trump had signed an executive order temporarily barring new immigrants for 60 days, including family members of US citizens. “The coming changes, the administration has suggested, will build on this April action,” the journal said.Given the high level of unemployment and joblessness, according to the daily, senior administration officials are operating on the assumption that the public, during the pandemic, will be willing to accept new limits on immigration.“Though the scope of the order hasn’t yet been decided, administration officials said it could range from suspensions of entire visa categories to the creation of incentives to hire Americans in industries hardest-hit by layoffs,” The Wall Street Journal reported.The Wall Street Journal report came a day after a group of four Republican Senators in a letter urged Trump to suspend all new guest worker visas for 60 days and some of its categories, including the H-1B visa, for at least the next year or until unemployment figures return to normal levels in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-admin-working-to-temporarily-ban-work-based-visas-report/story-YpWpO8s2ae3TQTpj5TtXtJ.html

The virus has since spread across the world, infecting almost 4 million people and killing almost a quarter-million from the Covid-19 disease it causes.“This coronavirus epidemic is a big test of our country’s governance and governing ability, and it exposed the weak links in how we address major epidemic and public health systems,” Li Bin, vice minister of the China National Health Commission, told reporters.The commission intends to build a “centralised and efficient” chain of command and reform, and modernise the disease prevention and control system, he said.The commission also aims to make better use of big data, artificial intelligence and cloud computing to better analyse the disease, trace the virus and distribute resources.He said the commission plans to step up research on core technology, improve medical insurance and better ensure the availability of emergency materials.China has not seen any new deaths from coronavirus for 24 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-reform-disease-prevention-control-system-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-RgoPYNPQhaiOOCTWkNJH1H.html
09-05-2020||World||American lawmakers introduce legislation in Congress to offer green cards to foreign doctors, nurses||Several American lawmakers have introduced a legislation in Congress to offer the 40,000 unused green cards to thousands of foreign nurses and doctors to meet the urgent needs of the overstretched healthcare sector in the US, the worst hit nation by the coronavirus pandemic. The US has nearly 1,284,000 cases of confirmed Covid-19 cases and over 77,000 people have died due to the highly contagious disease. The Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act would allow for recapturing green cards that were approved by Congress but unused in past years, allowing thousands of additional medical professionals to serve permanently in the United States.The legislation would send green cards to 25,000 nurses and 15,000 doctors during the Covid-19 pandemic and ensure that states like Iowa have the professionals they need to serve patients for years to come, a media release said.The move is likely to benefit a large number of Indian nurses and doctors in the US, who are either on H-1B or J2 visas. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.A Green Card, known officially as a Permanent Resident Card, is a document issued to immigrants to the US as evidence that the bearer has been granted the privilege of residing permanently.In the House of Representatives, the legislation has been introduced by lawmakers Abby Finkenauer, Brad Schneider, Tom Cole and Don Bacon. The bipartisan Senate companion bill is led by Senators David Perdue, Dick Durbin, Todd Young and Chris Coons.“We need all hands on deck to address this generational crisis,” congresswoman Finkenauer said.“We know this virus will not magically disappear and experts like Dr Anthony Fauci are warning of a second wave this fall. Rural areas, which make up much of my district, remain especially vulnerable and are already experiencing a shortage of medical professionals,” she said.The act is endorsed by organisations such as the American Medical Association, the Healthcare Leadership Council, the US Chamber of Commerce, the American Association of International Healthcare Recruitment, the American Hospital Association, the American Organization for Nursing Leadership, the Bipartisan Policy Center, the America’s Essential Hospitals and the Physicians for American Healthcare Access.“Physicians fighting Covid-19 are eager to hear these words: reinforcements are on the way. Recapturing 15,000 unused immigrant visas for physicians through the Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act would ease the burden on frontline physicians, who are risking their lives in understaffed hospitals,” said Patrice A Harris, president of the American Medical Association.The American Hospital Association (AHA) and the American Organization for Nursing Leadership (AONL) said there has never been a more urgent need for the care that foreign-born physicians and foreign-trained nurses provide than during the current Covid-19 pandemic. These professionals play a critical role in ensuring the health of our communities, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/american-lawmakers-introduce-legislation-in-congress-to-offer-green-cards-to-foreign-doctors-nurses/story-t26muI9pM45aOL19HPdyHM.html

09-05-2020||World||Covid-19: US planning to ship 8,000 ventilators abroad, says White House||President Donald Trump, who’s taken to calling the US the “king” of ventilators, is making plans to ship 8,000 of the breathing machines to foreign countries by the end of July to help in their fight against the coronavirus.That’s a long way from the early days of the virus when US medical workers were wondering if a shortage of ventilators would force them to make painful decisions about which patients would get them. Now, the US has a surplus and the president is sharing them with other countries — a goodwill gesture that also helps him offset criticism about his own early response to the pandemic.The White House did not respond to a request for specifics about how many ventilators have been sent so far, or the criteria for determining which countries will get them. But an administration official familiar with the effort provided the 8,000 figure as part of a list of actions aimed at supporting health systems abroad. The official was not authorized to discuss the projection publicly and spoke only on condition of anonymity.“We have nine factories that are throwing out ventilators at numbers that nobody can believe. There’s not been anything like that since the Second World War,” Trump said Friday.Trump said the US was giving the breathing machines to some countries. It was unclear if some nations would pay for the ventilators, which cost $5,000 to $30,000, depending on the model.“In a certain way, I’d like them to be donations. I really do. I think it’s good will,” Trump said earlier in the week. “It’s hard to say you have to pay us in order to save people from dying.” The machines shipped to other countries do not come from the national stockpile, which has about 12,000 ready to be deployed to U.S. jurisdictions. The U.S. stockpile, which is maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services, is being replenished with thousands of ventilators manufactured under the Defense Production Act.“Initially, it was very scary and we had a lot of states requesting numbers that could not be supplied,” Jared Kushner, an adviser to the president and Trump’s son-in-law, said Friday during a White House meeting with Republican members of Congress.“The president wanted to make sure that anybody in this country who needed a ventilator would get a ventilator. He saw what was happening in Italy, where people were dying in hospitals and not able to get the care they needed, and the president said ‘I don’t want that to happen in America.’” Kushner said the administration used the Defense Production Act to approve about 10 contracts with companies to make ventilators. Last year, the United States made about 30,000 ventilators, Kushner said. This year, in just a four-month period, the U.S. will make about 150,000, he said.“We’re in a place right now where we’re doing well,” Kushner said. “A lot of our allies — the countries that are friendly with America — are starting to get ventilators from us, and we have more than enough to take care of all the American citizens so it’s been a great success story.” In recent weeks, Trump has been recounting other countries’ calls for help. He said he’d offered Russia’s Vladimir Putin ventilators during a call on Thursday.“Countries know that we have tremendous amounts, tremendous volume and they’ve been calling. Nigeria just called. We’re giving them 250 ventilators. We have many countries, I’d say 12, 14 countries that called,” Trump said this week. “We’re sending quite a few to France. We’re sending quite a few to Spain and, Italy. We have four African countries.” Early last month, Trump said Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson requested ventilators. A UK government spokesperson said the country’s National Health Service had ordered ventilators from manufacturers around the world, including in the U.S. In tweets, Trump has identified Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Ethiopia and Indonesia as countries that have asked for ventilators.On Tuesday, Mexico said it received a U.S. shipment of 211 medical ventilators as part of aid promised by Trump. “As the saying goes, when there are hard times is when you know who your friends are,” said Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard.Mexican President Andés Manuel López Obrador said Trump promised aid when he called and asked for help in obtaining 1,000 ventilators and other equipment for intensive care units. Ebrard said the shipment includes equipment made by Swiss-based Hamilton Medical.Bolivia’s right-wing interim government said President Jeanine Añez spoke with Trump last weekend and he promised $750,000 in aid to buy testing equipment and 250 ventilators “as soon as possible.” The Bolivian government said Trump expressed support for Añez and her promise to move the country toward elections.As the virus outbreak makes its way across the globe, “there are going to be resource-poor areas that need ventilators, that probably have shortages of ventilators on a good day,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.Adalja said the ventilators should go to nations that have the intensive care unit doctors and respiratory therapists who understand how to operate them. Some countries don’t have such resources.“There may be some places where they need even more basic supplies than ventilators,” Adlaja said. “You want to make sure that they are being used in a place that has the capacity to use them and the training to be able to use them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-us-planning-to-ship-8-000-ventilators-abroad-says-white-house/story-fvOm7hwt05KFDhNqGt2OEP.html
09-05-2020||World||WHO readies coronavirus app for checking symptoms||The World Health Organization (WHO) plans to launch an app this month to enable people in under-resourced countries to assess whether they may have the novel coronavirus, and is considering a Bluetooth-based contact tracing feature too, an official told Reuters on Friday.The app will ask people about their symptoms and offer guidance on whether they may have Covid-19, the potentially lethal illness caused by the coronavirus, said Bernardo Mariano, chief information officer for the WHO. Other information, such as how to get tested, will be personalized according to the user’s country.Though the WHO will release a version on app stores globally, any government will be able to take the app’s underlying technology, add features and release its own version on app stores, Mariano said in a phone interview.India, Australia and the United Kingdom already have released official virus apps using their own technology, with common features including telling people whether to get tested based on their symptoms and logging people’s movements to enable more efficient contact tracing. Several countries are ramping up contact tracing, or the process of finding, testing and isolating individuals who crossed paths with an infectious individual. It is seen as vital to safely opening economies, and apps that automate parts of the process could accelerate efforts.The WHO expects its app to draw interest in other countries, including some in South America and Africa where case numbers are rising. They may lack the technology and engineers to develop apps or be struggling to offer testing and education.“The value is really for countries that do not have anything,” Mariano said. “We would be leaving behind the ones that are not able to (provide an app), that have fragile health systems.”Engineers and designers, including some who previously worked at Alphabet Inc’s Google and Microsoft Corp, have been volunteering for weeks to develop the new app with about five of them overseeing the process. They are designing it open-source on the hosting service GitHub, meaning code is open to public input. Several team members declined to comment.Mariano said he wants to include additional tools beyond the symptom checker, including a self-help guide for mental health care.The team also is considering what the WHO refers to as proximity tracing.Engineers have done preliminary work and talked to smartphone operating system makers Apple Inc and Google about possibly adopting technology the companies plan to release jointly this month to make tracing easier. The technology relies on virtual “handshakes” between phones that come within a few feet of each other for at least five minutes. Phones keep anonymised logs of such encounters, allowing someone who later tests positive to anonymously send notifications to recent contacts about their possible exposure to the virus. But Mariano said legal and privacy considerations have prevented the WHO from committing to such a feature yet. He expressed concern about the many businesses pitching proximity tools turning around and using any personal data they gather to generate revenue later.“We want to make sure we ring-fence all the risks around it,” he said. Apple and Google have said their system will not use any data for other purposes and will be stopped when the pandemic ends.The WHO plans to release guidance as soon as next week on issues countries should consider as they weigh their own proximity tracing apps.To reach people with limited internet access, the WHO is working to deliver information via text messages. In March, it launched an account on Facebook Inc’s , WhatsApp to provide users with information about the coronavirus, and it partnered with the company’s Free Basics program to make some information available without users incurring data charges.The WHO also plans to release an app next week to inform health workers globally about best practices for donning protective gear, washing hands and treating the virus. The organization already has a general app, WHO Info, that largely mirrors its website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-readies-coronavirus-app-for-checking-symptoms/story-qI5RyBKFOcIouN4EUDd1fN.html
09-05-2020||World||‘Historic decline’: Canada loses nearly 2 million jobs amid Covid-19 crisis||Canada has recorded a historic 15.7% decline in employment since February this year and lost nearly two million jobs in April as part of the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.These details were provided by the government agency Statistics Canada or StatCan in its Labour Force Survey. As a result, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has extended a wage subsidy programme that was scheduled to last till June 6.The decline in employment since February “far exceeds” those seen in downturns in the past including the global economic meltdown in 2008-2009 and previous recessions. For April alone, the unemployment rate rose to 13%, with 1.93 million new unemployed.Also read: Anti-malaria drug fails another test as a Covid-19 treatment, says studyThe overall scenario could even be worse, as StatCan noted, “The April unemployment rate would be 17.8% when adjusted to reflect those who were not counted as unemployed for reasons specific to the Covid-19 economic shutdown.” This, it explained, was because many people wanted to return to work once their industries reopened after the forced shutdown due to Covid-19 and could not be counted among the unemployed.“In April, more than one-third (36.7%) of the potential labour force did not work or worked less than half of their usual hours, illustrating the continuing impact of the Covid-19 economic shutdown on the labour market,” StatCan added, pointing to the adverse impact of the coronavirus crisis beyond the topline numbers.Adjustments due to the disease were also reflected in the data. Nearly five million people worked from home, including 3.3 million who usually worked at a location other than their residence. StatCan stated, “The actions taken by various levels of government to protect public health amounted to an intentional shutdown of the economy which resulted in a sudden shock to the Canadian labour market.”Given the uncertainty ahead, the Canadian government has decided to extend a wage subsidy programme, which was to expire on June 6. The CA$ 73 billion initiative provides businesses, stressed by the crisis, 75% of their payroll, up to about CA $ 3500 per month per employee, in an effort to get them to retain workers. Trudeau cited the StatCan job numbers to announce that the programme will continue beyond the original end date. The extension, he said, will be necessary to “kickstart” the economy once the country returns to a degree of normalcy after the worst of the crisis has passed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-loses-nearly-2-million-jobs-witnesses-historic-decline-in-employment-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-s0he3LkvZ3tOkG8IuQju6J.html
09-05-2020||World||Pence spokeswoman, married to top Trump adviser, diagnosed with coronavirus||US Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary, the wife of one of President Donald Trump’s senior advisers, has tested positive for the coronavirus, raising alarm about the virus’ potential spread within the White House’s inner most circle.The diagnosis of Katie Miller, who is married to White House immigration adviser and speech writer Stephen Miller, was revealed by Trump in a meeting with Republican lawmakers on Friday, a day after news that Trump’s personal valet had tested positive for the virus.“Katie, she tested very good for a long period of time and then all of a sudden today she tested positive,” Trump said, noting he himself had not been in contact with her but that she had spent time with the vice president. “I understand Mike has been tested...and he tested negative.”Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicDespite Trump’s comments, the two cases in quick succession heightened fears of contagion for the president and vice president, who are leading the US response to the pandemic, and who have both resumed travel and business schedules even as the US death toll from the virus has topped 75,000.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Friday sought to defend administration efforts to protect Trump and Pence, pointing to new measures taken by the White House including contact tracing and putting in place all guidelines recommended for essential workers.“We’ve taken every single precaution to protect the president,” McEnany insisted to reporters at a White House briefing. She also noted regular cleanings and adherence to distancing guidelines of six feet between individuals that are not always followed at crowded White House events.“We’ve done every single thing that Dr. (Deborah) Birx and Dr. (Anthony) Fauci have asked us to do,” she added, referring to highly respected physicians on the White House coronavirus task force.West Wing staffers around Trump and Pence have not been wearing masks regularly.Earlier on Friday, Trump was asked in a Fox News interview whether those who serve him food would now cover their faces. “They’ve already started,” he said on the network’s “Fox and Friends” morning program.The White House has also instituted daily, as opposed to weekly, coronavirus tests of Trump and Pence. Both men tested negative for the virus and were feeling well after the valet, a military service member who works as a White House assistant - came down with the virus.Trump told Fox News he has not yet been tested for antibodies to the coronavirus but probably would be soon. Such a test could confirm previous exposure.Trump and Pence maintain busy public schedules. The vice president, who has led the coronavirus task force, flew to Iowa on Friday to meet with faith leaders about holding “responsible” gatherings and to discuss the food supply at Midwestern grocery chain Hy-Vee Inc’s headquarters.News of the positive test for Pence’s aide prompted staff to deplane Air Force 2 on Friday morning and briefly delayed the takeoff.“We went back and looked into all the person’s contacts most recently,” a senior official told reporters, according to a pool report. Six individuals who may have been in contact with the infected aide were removed from the flight and later tested negative. Two of the individuals were members of Pence’s press office.Trump on Friday attended a public event at the World War Two memorial with elderly veterans where neither Trump, first lady Melania Trump, the veterans nor military officials seen at the ceremony wore masks.Trump later met face-to-face with Republican members of Congress at the White House where no face masks appeared to be worn. The lawmakers were tested for the virus before the meeting.DICTATORS, KINGS, AND QUEENSProtective facial coverings have been a hard sell for Trump and Pence despite a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control that people wear masks or alternatives.Both Trump and Pence have drawn fire for not donning masks, with critics arguing they are setting a bad example for Americans.Trump himself has said he would not wear a mask and has not publicly worn one to any of his events amid the pandemic, but told reporters this week he tried some on behind the scenes during his visit to a Honeywell face mask factory in Arizona.The virus, which first surfaced in Wuhan, China late last year, has infected more than a million Americans and driven millions into unemployment as a result of lockdown measures put in place to curb a rise in infections.

09-05-2020||World||Triple antiviral drug shows early promise in Covid-19 trial||A triple drug combination of antiviral medicines helped relieve symptoms in patients with mild to moderate Covid-19 infection and swiftly reduced the amount of virus in their bodies, according to results of a small trial in Hong Kong.The trial, which involved 127 patients, compared those given the combination drug - made up of the HIV medicine lopinavir–ritonavir, the hepatitis drug ribavirin, and the multiple sclerosis treatment interferon beta - with a control group given just the HIV drug.The findings, published in the Lancet medical journal, showed that on average, people who got the triple drug reached the point of no detectable virus five days earlier than those in the control group - at 7 days versus 12 days.“Our trial demonstrates that early treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 with a triple combination of antiviral drugs may rapidly suppress the amount of virus in a patient’s body, relieve symptoms, and reduce the risk to health-care workers,” said Kwok-Yung Yuen, a professor at the University of Hong Kong who co-led the research.He said the lower risk to health workers would be due to the combination drug’s effect in reducing ‘viral shedding’ - which is when the virus is detectable and potentially transmissible.In the trial, all patients received standard hospital care as needed, including ventilation support, dialysis support, antibiotics and corticosteroids.Kowk-Yung Yuen said the findings were “encouraging”, but that the triple drug’s effect now needed to be tested in larger numbers of patients and in people with more severe Covid-19 illness.Independent experts agreed that the findings were positive, but said larger and more detailed studies would be needed.This ... definitely justifies the consideration of adding interferon beta to the list of genuinely, evidence-based, promising treatments to be tested in further randomised trials,” said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.He said that long years of experience in treating the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS have shown that it is best treated with combinations of different drugs “and this could also be the case with Covid-19”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/triple-antiviral-drug-shows-early-promise-in-covid-19-trial/story-kpd6uPrQYq1v8s32Ovc2bJ.html

The news has come on a day when the world quietly observed VE Day to mark the surrender of Nazi forces in Europe on May 8, 1945. The previous record of job losses in the US, at 10.4%, was recorded way back in 1948. An estimated 33.5 million people in the US have already filed for unemployments benefits over the past six weeks since lockdowns came into effect in mid-March, according to weekly data released on Thursday. “Today’s report reflects the massive impact that measures to contain the coronavirus have had on the American workforce,” Eugene Scalia, the US labour secretary, said in a statement. US President Donald Trump tried to strike a positive note, saying the economy will bounce back. “Those jobs will all be back and they’ll be back very soon,” he told Fox News.An aide to US vice-president Mike Pence has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a CNBC report. The development came a day after it emerged that Trump’s personal valet had tested positive for Covid-19.The respiratory disease has claimed over 271,000 lives worldwide, with the US being the worst-hit nation, recording over 77,000 deaths.Fatalities in the country went up by 2,231 in the last 24 hours and the number of confirmed cases increased by 28,420.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-cases-near-4mn-as-job-losses-wreck-us/story-aQdl1do5pjEP00dazlApMJ.html

Nepal police said 45 of them had been arrested.“Four police personnel, including a Deputy Superintendent of Police, Haribahadur Basnet, were injured in the clash when the protestors entered a prohibited zone,” Superintendent of Nepal Police, Somendra Singh Rathore, told ANI over phone.Like India, Nepal suspended international flights on March 22 as part of precautionary measures against the spread of the coronavirus. The restrictions will continue till this month-end.The protesters, stranded in the country because of flight restrictions, said they had run out of money and didn’t have the means to stay in the country any longer. Their embassy, they said according to reports reaching here, wasn’t helping them.While several countries, including the US, the UK, Australia and France have chartered evacuation flights for their citizens in Nepal, no official flights have been made to rescue stranded Chinese nationals. The protest - some of them held placards such as “I want to go home!” - turned violent when the police stopped them entering a prohibited zone of Singha Darbar that also houses the Prime Minister’s Office.“They may face charges of protesting in the restricted zone and violating the lockdown under existing laws,” police spokeswoman Kiran Bajracharya told AFP.Police said they made an effort to persuade the Chinese nationals to turn back and not violate the restrictions hadn’t helped.Nepal has reported just over 100 cases and has among the lowest number of coronavirus infections. On Friday, according to Nepal’s health ministry, three fresh cases were reported in the country.“The total number of coronavirus cases has reached 102 in Nepal with three more tested positive on Friday. Two men aged 16 and 22 from Kapilvastu and a 16 year old man from Nepalgunj have tested positive for COVID – 19,” the health ministry said in a statement.Nepal on Friday reported three new cases of the coronavirus, taking the total infections in the country to over 100, the health ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/45-chinese-nationals-in-nepal-demand-flights-to-go-home-throw-stones/story-IHVldc3ZR9gMTF3dFEcZmJ.html

The explosion, triggered by a remote- controlled device, went off on the road 14 km from the Pakistan-Iran border.The military spokesperson said the vehicle of the Frontier Corps South Balochistan was attacked when it was returning from Buleda, a small valley north of Turbat in Kech district. The military statement said the soldiers had gone to check possible routes used by terrorists in the mountainous terrain of Mekran.The officer was identified by the military as Major Nadeem Abbas Bhatti, resident of Hafizabad in Pakistan’s Punjab province.One local media outlet such as The Balochistan Post said a Baloch armed group that has been fighting for independence, Baloch Liberation Army, has claimed responsibility for the attack. Another website said the Baloch Raaji Ajoi Sangar, coalition of four armed groups, had also claimed responsibility.The Baloch Liberation Army statement accused the army officer killed in the attack to be “directly involved in the formation and leading of so-called death squads of criminal gangs operated by the army” in the Kech region. The statement also accused the army officer of helping out drug dealers and arming them to take on the rebels.“The Pakistani military has advanced operations in Tigran and other areas of Turbat over the past several days, targeting Baloch civilians, including harassing women and children,” the Balochistan Post said, quoting a BLA spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-army-major-6-soldiers-killed-in-landmine-blast-in-south-balochistan/story-oBWFkvaYtWNrIyb4y1yWcL.html
