The row, which dominated public discourse for several days, appeared to lose much momentum after Prime Minister Boris Johnson consistently backed his aide despite over 40 Conservative MPs and others demanding his resignation.The Durham police said there was no breach in Cummings travelling from London to Durham in end-March when he and his wife had coronavirus symptoms, but their later trip from Durham to Barnard Castle would have been a “minor breach”.In the UK’s criminal justice system, the police usually uses terms such as ‘might have’ to express opinion in a case, since bringing charges and reaching a conviction are a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service and the courts.The police said in a lengthy statement: “Durham Constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castle…and have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the Regulations that would have warranted police intervention”.“Durham Constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing. Had a Durham Constabulary police officer stopped Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Cummings to return to the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis”.“Had this advice been accepted by Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken...Therefore Durham Constabulary will take no further action in this matter and has informed Cummings of this decision”.Critics interpreted the statement as substantiating Cummings breaching rules, and reiterated their demand that he resign or be dismissed.However, the prime minister’s spokesperson said: “The police have made clear they are taking no action against Cummings over his self-isolation and that going to Durham did not breach the regulations. The prime minister has said he believes Cummings behaved reasonably and legally given all the circumstances and he regards this issue as closed.”Labour leader Keir Starmer said: “I’ve seen what Durham Police have said. Obviously that, on the face of it, is inconsistent with what the prime minister said. And that presents him with a problem. But, frankly, he’s too weak to do anything about it”.He added: “I don’t think he’s going to do anything because he cannot, it seems, continue without his adviser”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minor-breach-no-action-uk-cops-on-pm-boris-aide/story-5iYHyIk4sdfHl5Liljcq1M.html
28-05-2020||World||UK mulls citizenship offer over Hong Kong security law||Foreign secretary Dominic Raab and home secretary Priti Patel are exploring options to grant full citizenship to people in Hong Kong who have ‘British National (Overseas)’ status as one of the responses to Beijing imposing a security law in the former British colony.The announcement came soon after a joint statement by the UK, US, Canada and Australia expressing “deep concern” over the new law that has prompted clashes in Hong Kong.The BNO status is not full British citizenship. The status is for people who were a British overseas territories citizen by connection with Hong Kong before the handover to China on July 1, 1997. Certain rights and freedoms were to be ensured under the handover agreement within the ‘one country, two systems’ framework.Raab said: “Currently they (BNO passport holders) only have the right to come to the UK for six months. If China continues down this path and implements this national security legislation we will change that status, and we will remove that six-month limit and allow those BNO passport holders to come to the UK and to apply to work and study for extendable periods of 12 months and that would itself provide a pathway to future citizenship”.“If they implement and apply this national security legislation in the terms that have been described, we will change the BNO passport holder status and the arrangements for them in the way that I’ve just described”, he added.Patel tweeted: “Deeply concerned at China’s proposals for legislation to national security in Hong Kong. If imposed, @DominicRaab & I will explore options for a path to citizenship for BNO passport holders. UK will continue to defend the rights & freedoms of the people of Hong Kong”.The four-country joint statement by Raab, Australian foreign minister Marise Payne, Canadian foreign minister François-Philippe Champagne, and US secretary of state Michael Pompeo said: “Hong Kong has flourished as a bastion of freedom. The international community has a significant and long-standing stake in Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability”.“Direct imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong by the Beijing authorities, rather than through Hong Kong’s own institutions as provided for under Article 23 of the Basic Law, would curtail the Hong Kong people’s liberties, and in doing so, dramatically erode Hong Kong’s autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous”. They added that China’s decision to impose the new law on Hong Kong was in direct conflict with its international obligations under the principles of the legally-binding, UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration.The four foreign ministers said: “The world’s focus on a global pandemic requires enhanced trust in governments and international cooperation. Beijing’s unprecedented move risks having the opposite effect”.“As Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity are jeopardised by the new imposition, we call on the Government of China to work with the Hong Kong SAR Government and the people of Hong Kong to find a mutually acceptable accommodation that will honour China’s international obligations under the UN-filed Sino-British Joint Declaration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-mulls-citizenship-offer-over-hong-kong-security-law/story-RKUWMZY6AsaaYghFqPVvrN.html
28-05-2020||World||Trump calls Covid epidemic a ‘bad gift’ from China as toll in US crosses 100,000||President Donald Trump finally acknowledged on Thursday that US Covid-19 toll had surpassed 100,000, calling it a “sad milestone” almost 20 hours late, and promptly proceeded to blame it on China, saying the coronavirus behind it was a “very bad gift from China”.Trump had been noticeably quiet on the toll as he tweeted and retweeted about an upcoming executive order on social media, about his political rivals, ongoing legal case involving his first national security adviser Michael Flynn, and his predecessor President Barack Obama.“We have just reached a very sad milestone with the coronavirus pandemic deaths reaching 100,000,” he wrote in a tweet Thursday, hours after the Johns Hopkins University tracker marked the crossing.In a tweet minutes after, the president wrote, “All over the World the CoronaVirus, a very bad “gift” from China, marches on. Not good!”President Trump and his Republican allies have sought to shift all of the blame for the epidemic including the devastation caused in the United States by this administration’s delayed and botched response, on China, where the first infections occurred last December. Approval ratings of the president’s handling of the crisis have been declining steadily.The toll had risen to 100,467 by Thursday morning (much earlier, according to some trackers), with 1,505 deaths in the last 24 hours, marking a return to four-digit toll after days. Infections rose by 18,263 to reach 1.7 million. The United State accounts for around a third of both the infections and fatalities worldwide.The epidemic has continued to take a heavy toll on the US economy with 2.1 million more American filings for unemployment benefits, according to new data released by the US department of labor. The total of jobs lost due to the Covid-19 lockdown is now up to 41 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-calls-covid-epidemic-a-bad-gift-from-china-as-toll-in-us-crosses-100-000/story-3HrJ3cWOe2KdSyqG0NFMQO.html
28-05-2020||World||Big day for social media fairness, says Trump on upcoming executive order||President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order later Thursday that would roll back immunity enjoyed by social media platforms such as Twitter, Youtube and Facebook for content posted on their websites, according to multiple US media reports.“This will be a Big Day for Social Media and FAIRNESS!” the president wrote in a tweet Thursday, reconfirming a White House announcement from Wednesday of the upcoming order. But he shared no details.The order is chiefly expected to allow federal regulators to rethink a law — Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act from 1998 — that absolves social media platforms of all responsibility or accountability for content posted on their websites, unlike a news publication. The law leaves it to the companies to regulate, or not regulate, their published content.The executive order is also expected to provide for the Federal Communication Commission, an independent body currently headed by Trump-nominee Ajit Pai, an Indian American, to receive and review complaints of political bias of these platforms.Lastly, the order is expected to prohibit federal ad-spendings on platforms found in violation.Unidentified Trump administration official who spoke selectively to US news publications cautioned that the order was still a draft and could change.And experts have said the order is very likely to be challenged and in courts and may not survive.Trump and other Republicans have for long been calling for action against tech companies for a while now alleging they are unfairly targeted for censoring. The administration has had several iterations of the order that could finally be out later Thursday as signaled by the president.Trump has been in a twitter-rage sinceMay 26 when Twitter deployed a rarely used tool to fact-check two linked posts by him mail-in ballots. “Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged & even illegally printed out & fraudulently signed.,” the president wrote, reiterating his opposition to a voting tool he himself used in the 2018 elections.Twitter fact-checked the post, and the linked post.“Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!” Trump raged in a tweet, accusing the social media company of interfering in the 2020 presidential election. “We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen,” he wrote in a tweet on Thursday, and fired one more later in the day, alleging, “Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election.”.Jack Dorsey, the Twitter CEO, is not backing down, not yet. “We’ll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information about elections globally. And we will admit to and own any mistakes we make,” he wrote on twitter Thursday night, and added, taking a swipe at Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO, “This does not make as un ‘arbiter of truth’.”Zuckerberg, who has faced questions about content on Facebook, specially fake news, had told Fox News in a pre-recorded interview that private companies shouldn’t be the “arbiter of truth”. Trump had retweeted a post of Zuckerberg’s quote from the interview.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/big-day-for-social-media-fairness-says-trump-of-upcoming-executive-order/story-LlpZwlIF2YAT3c1EK4g7BN.html

The two states were particularly hit by the storm that also affected neighbouring Bangladesh. Prince Charles addressed a similar message to the Bangladesh Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina.The message to Modi says: “My wife and I wanted you to know how deeply saddened we are by the loss of life and appalling devastation you and all the people of West Bengal and Odisha have suffered as a result of Storm Amphan”.“We feel so much for you and your people that you have had to endure such a disaster at the same time as having to contend with the Covid-19 pandemic. Our hearts go out to all those who have been bereaved and to those whose homes have been destroyed”.“However inadequate it may be at such a very difficult time, we did just want to assure you that all those affected are in our thoughts and special prayers”, he wrote.Prince Charles, heir to the throne, tested positive for the virus in March and recovered after a period of self-isolation in the Balmoral Castle Scotland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-charles-condoles-deaths-damage-due-to-cyclone-amphan/story-l0i5SvAyo0qiaXl7blDEqJ.html

However, there is a growing concern that some nations, including the United States, could seek to hoard a successful candidate as initial manufacturing capacity is unlikely to be sufficient to meet global demand.Moderna said last week that its vaccine candidate, the first to be tested in the United States, produced protective antibodies in a small group of healthy volunteers, offering a glimmer of hope for a vaccine among the most advanced in development.“This expansion will increase supply of lipid excipients used to manufacture our mRNA products,” Moderna’s chief technical operations and quality officer, Juan Andres, said.Moderna plans to supply millions of doses per month in 2020 and tens of millions a month in 2021 if the vaccine proves successful.The company has signed a 10-year deal with Swiss contract drug manufacturer Lonza to help speed up manufacturing the vaccine with the aim to reach up to a billion doses annually.Moderna’s shares were up 2% before the bell on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-extends-lipids-deal-to-boost-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-output/story-PDbdBrrmoaleHZThBv7w9H.html

28-05-2020||World||Covid-19: UK launches ‘test and trace’ system to ease lockdown||Keen to reopen parts of the economy, the Boris Johnson government on Thursday launched its next phase of response to the coronavirus pandemic: a ‘test and trace’ system that involves thousands of tracers tracking down people to limit the spread of the virus.The system was launched in England but will not be fully operational until the end of June. It is intended to help lift blanket lockdown restrictions and move towards more localised and targeted measures, as the UK’s death toll reached 37,460 and 267,240 cases as of Wednesday.Scotland and Northern Ireland have similar systems, while Wales is due to launch its version in early June.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageHealth secretary Matt Hancock said: “As we move to the next stage of our fight against coronavirus, we will be able to replace national lockdowns with individual isolation and, if necessary, local action where there are outbreaks”.“NHS Test and Trace will be vital to stopping the spread of the virus. It is how we will be able to protect our friends and family from infection…This new system will help us keep this virus under control while carefully and safely lifting the lockdown nationally”.Under the system, tracers will text, email or call people who test positive with coronavirus and ask who they have had contact with. Any of those contacts deemed at risk of infection will be told to isolate for 14 days, even if they are not sick.Those who have already had the virus will also be asked to self-isolate. People identified as having been in close contact with someone who has a positive test will need to stay at home for 14 days, even if they do not have symptoms, to stop unknowingly spreading the virus.The system includes 25,000 dedicated contact tracing staff with the capacity to trace the contacts of 10,000 people who test positive for coronavirus per day, officials said.“The rollout of the NHS Test and Trace service has been made possible by the rapid expansion of testing. The largest network of diagnostic testing facilities in British history has been created and will soon have the capacity to carry out 200,000 tests a day. This includes 50 drive-through sites, more than 100 mobile testing units and three mega laboratories” they added.The system also includes an app that is currently under trial in the Isle of Wight and is expected to be rolled out elsewhere in the coming weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-launches-test-and-trace-system-to-ease-lockdown/story-BQFBPLh0feh2WhF4Ees8yM.html
28-05-2020||World||China passes controversial Hong Kong security law, tightens grip over former British colony||China on Thursday passed a new security legislation for Hong Kong that makes any show of dissidence against the mainland a crime and for the first time paves the way for Beijing to install its own security agencies in the protest-wracked city.Critics of the new law and several western countries, most prominently the US, have said it essentially ends the unique system of governance under the “one country, two systems” mechanism which governed Hong Kong since the British handed it over to China in 1997.The writing in of the new security law into Hong Kong’s special charter, or Basic Law, will see the mainland’s control over the SAR tighten substantially.The city has seen violent protests since last June on that very issue: Beijing’s apparent tightening of control over the city and its impact on freedoms including that of free speech and expression.“The move came after prolonged social unrest and escalating street violence had plunged Hong Kong into the gravest situation since its return to the motherland in 1997,” official news agency, Xinhua reported, referring to the protests.The National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s rubber-stamp Parliament, passed the bill with 2878 votes in favour on Thursday, the last day of its delayed and shortened annual meeting; one voted against it and six abstained.Leading Chinese politicians have stoutly defended the bill.Addressing his annual press conference at the end of the NPC, Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday said that the approval of “…Hong Kong national security legislation aims for HK’s prosperity”.Li said the law would be good for Hong Kong’s long-term stability and prosperity and the “one country, two systems” formula would remain a national policy“It will uphold and improve the ‘one country, two systems’ policy,” NPC chairperson Li Zhanshu told delegates during the closing ceremony.“It is in line with the constitution and Hong Kong’s Basic Law and is in the interest of all Chinese people including Hong Kong people,” he added.Full details of the law are yet to be made public but it criminalises secession, subversion, terrorism and activities by foreign forces that interfere in Hong Kong.The bill says that “when needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People’s Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to fulfil relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law”.Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam said her government would work with Beijing to complete the legislative work as soon as possible, according to agency reports from the city.“The law will not affect the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents,” she said in a statement welcoming the Chinese parliament’s vote.The new legislation is set to worsen relations between China and the US.“Already, international business is facing the pressure of increased tension between the U.S. and China, but the enactment of China’s security law for Hong Kong could take the tension to a whole new level,” Tara Joseph, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong wrote in a commentary for the South China Morning Post newspaper.“This is show time for Hong Kong,” she wrote.“This is the death knell for Hong Kong, make no mistake of it, this is the end of ‘one country, two systems’, the Hong Kong that we loved, a free Hong Kong,” pro-democracy lawmaker from Hong Kong Dennis Kwok was quoted by agencies as telling reporters on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-passes-controversial-hong-kong-security-law-tightens-grip-over-former-british-colony/story-XlAIJV8C83ROUmETdgLTNL.html

28-05-2020||World||China parliament approves Hong Kong security bill as tensions with US rise||China’s parliament approved a decision on Thursday to go forward with national security legislation for Hong Kong that democracy activists in the city and Western countries fear could erode its freedoms and jeopardise its role as a global financial hub.China says the legislation will aim to tackle secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference in the city but the plan, unveiled in Beijing last week, triggered the first big protests in Hong Kong for months.Riot police were out in force in Hong Kong as its lawmakers debated another piece of legislation, a bill to criminalise disrespect of China’s national anthem, while the United States piled on pressure aimed at preserving the city’s autonomy.Dozens of protesters gathered in a shopping mall to chant slogans but there was no repeat of disturbances the previous day when police made 360 arrests as thousands took to the streets in anger over the anthem bill and the national security legislation proposed by China.Last year, the city was rocked for months by often violent pro-democracy demonstrations over an unsuccessful bid to introduce a law governing extradition to China.The Chinese government’s security law for the city is fuelling fear in Hong Kong and beyond that Beijing is imposing its authority and eroding the high degree of autonomy the former British colony has enjoyed under a “one country, two systems” formula since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.Members of China’s mostly rubberstamp parliament, the National People’s Congress, in the Great Hall of the People to the west of Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, burst into prolonged applause when the tally showed 2,878 votes to one in favour of moving forward with legislation, with six abstentions.Details of the law are expected to be drawn up in coming weeks. It is expected to be enacted before September. Chinese authorities and the Beijing-backed government in Hong Kong say there is no threat to the city’s autonomy and the new law would be tightly focused.China’s Premier Li Keqiang said the law would be good for Hong Kong’s long-term stability and prosperity and the “one country, two systems” formula would remain a national policy.Conflict between China and the United States would harm both sides while both stood to gain from cooperation, he told a news conference.Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed leader Carrie Lam said her government would work with Beijing to complete the legislative work as soon as possible.“The law will not affect the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents,” she said in a statement welcoming the Chinese parliament’s vote.Democracy campaigners in the city were despondent, however.“This is the death knell for Hong Kong, make no mistake of it, this is the end of ‘one country, two systems’ ... the Hong Kong that we loved, a free Hong Kong,” pro-democracy lawmaker Dennis Kwok told reporters.‘SHOW TIME’The United States, Britain and the European Union have also expressed concern about the security legislation and its implications for China’s freest city.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday Hong Kong no longer qualified for special treatment under U.S. law, potentially dealing a crushing blow to its status as a major financial hub.The proposed security law was “only the latest in a series of actions” undermining Hong Kong freedoms, he told Congress.“No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground,” he said. The security law could see Chinese intelligence agencies set up bases in the city.Relations between the two countries have been tense over China’s claims in the South China Sea and trade, with the coronavirus pandemic adding to the acrimony.“Already, international business is facing the pressure of increased tension between the U.S. and China, but the enactment of China’s security law for Hong Kong could take the tension to a whole new level,” said Tara Joseph, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.“This is show time for Hong Kong,” she said in a commentary in the South China Morning Post.U.S. President Donald Trump has promised action over Hong Kong, with an announcement at the end of the week. More than 1,300 U.S. companies have offices in the city, providing about 100,000 jobs.China said it would take necessary countermeasures against foreign interference in what it insists are its internal affairs.Hong Kong stocks underperformed most of Asia, closing down 0.7%.Trump’s possible response could include visa and economic sanctions, David Stilwell, the State Department’s assistant secretary for East Asia, told reporters.

28-05-2020||World||UK PM appoints Indian-origin academic as Natural History Museum Trustee||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has appointed Indian-origin academic Yadvinder Malhi as a new Trustee of the Natural History Museum in London.The 52-year-old expert will take on the unpaid advisory role for a period of four years until May 2024. Malhi is a professor of Ecosystem Science at the University of Oxford, Jackson Senior Research Fellow in Biodiversity and Conservation at Oriel College, Oxford, and the director of the Oxford Centre for Tropical Forests and the Oxford University Biodiversity Network. “I have been enthralled by the Natural History Museum since my first visits as a child, and I am delighted to be now joining it as a Trustee. I believe no entity in the UK better celebrates the magnificence of the natural world,” he said.“I am particularly excited in helping the Museum become a leader and partner in helping address what I see as the great challenges of our time: tackling climate change and the restoration of the natural world, both within the United Kingdom and internationally. “The museum brings a wealth of scientific expertise, practical experience and public reach that has so much potential to make a really significant contribution to tackling these challenges,” he said.Malhi’s research interests have focused on the impacts of climate change and other types of change on the biosphere, and how the protection and restoration of the biosphere can contribute to mitigating and adapting to climate change, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said in a statement this week.“Much of his work has focussed on the tropics, and he has established a network of intensive study and monitoring of tropical ecosystems spanning Amazonia, Africa and Asia. “More locally, he has a strong interest in the many possible forms of ecosystem restoration in the UK and Europe, how such restoration can be scaled up, and how it can best contribute to biodiversity recovery and climate change goals,” DCMS said.Malhi, a former President of the Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation, Chair of Trustees of the Global Biodiversity Foundation and a Fellow of the Royal Society, has authored or co-authored over 400 scientific papers on ecosystems and climate change.His appointment has been made in accordance with the UK Cabinet Office’s Governance Code on Public Appointments, which requires that any significant political activity undertaken by an appointee in the last five years is declared. Malhi has not declared any political activity that would fall under holding office, public speaking, making a recordable donation or candidature for election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-appoints-indian-origin-academic-as-natural-history-museum-trustee/story-1ku77wLT3xhhTbVxkFLNPL.html
28-05-2020||World||Two anti-inflammatory drugs found that may inhibit Covid-19 virus reproduction||Two anti-inflammatory drugs, one prescribed for humans and another for animals, may inhibit a key enzyme in the replication or reproduction of the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19, according to a study. The study, published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, used computer techniques to analyse 6,466 drugs authorised by various drug agencies for both human and veterinary use. The researchers from Universitat Rovira in Spain assessed whether these drugs could be used to inhibit the main protease of the virus (M-pro) enzyme, which plays an essential role in the replication of the virus. They found that a human and a veterinary anti-inflammatory drug -- Carprofen and Celecoxib -- inhibit a key enzyme in the replication and transcription of the virus responsible for COVID-19. Finding drugs that can inhibit the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is an essential step to finding the vaccine that can definitively bring the spread of the virus to an end, according to the researchers. M-pro enzyme is responsible for cutting two polypeptides -- generated by the virus itself -- and generating a number of proteins that are essential for the reproduction of the virus, the researchers said. Some of the trials coordinated by the World Health Organization against the COVID-19 pandemic also aim to inhibit M-pro using two antiretrovirals such as Lopinavir and Ritonavir, drugs initially designed to treat HIV, they said. In the new study, the researchers predicted that seven of the 6,466 drugs analysed may inhibit M-pro. The results have been shared with the international initiative of scientists, COVID Moonshot, which has selected two of these seven compounds -- Carprofen and Celecoxib -- in order to test their ability to inhibit M-pro in vitro, they said. The findings show that at a concentration of 50 micromolar (μM) of Celecoxib or Carprofen, the inhibition of the in vitro activity of M-pro enzyme is 11.90 and 4.0 per cent, respectively. Both molecules could be used as a starting point for further lead optimisation to obtain even more potent derivatives, the researchers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-anti-inflammatory-drugs-found-that-may-inhibit-covid-19-virus-reproduction/story-5ghoq1cfLDEGsFVJBnbjHP.html
28-05-2020||World||86 million children could be pushed into household poverty by end of 2020 due to Covid-19: Report||The number of children living in poor households across low and middle-income countries could increase by 86 million to reach 672 million by the end of 2020 due to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new study.The deadly virus has so far infected 5,695,290 people and claimed 355,692 lives globally, according to a tally by the Johns Hopkins University.“The economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic could push up to 86 million more children into household poverty by the end of 2020, an increase of 15 per cent,” said the study conducted jointly by the UNICEF and humanitarian organisation Save the Children. The analysis highlighted that without urgent action to protect families from the financial hardships caused by the pandemic, the total number of children living below the national poverty line in low and middle-income countries could reach 672 million by year-end. Nearly two-thirds of these children live in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and countries across Europe and Central Asia could see the most significant increase, up to 44 per cent across the region. Latin America and the Caribbean could see a 22 per cent increase.“The coronavirus pandemic has triggered an unprecedented socio-economic crisis that is draining resources for families all over the world,” UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said in a statement.“The scale and depth of financial hardship among families threatens to roll back years of progress in reducing child poverty and to leave children deprived of essential services. Without concerted action, families barely getting by could be pushed into poverty, and the poorest families could face levels of deprivation that have not been seen for decades,” Fore said.The organisations warned that the impact of the global economic crisis caused by the pandemic and related containment policies is two-fold -- immediate loss of income meant families are less able to afford the basics, including food and water, less likely to access health care or education, and more at risk of child marriage, violence, exploitation and abuse.Save the Children International CEO Inger Ashing said the “shocking poverty impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will hit children hard.” “Children are highly vulnerable to even short periods of hunger and malnutrition — potentially affecting them for their whole life. If we act now and decisively, we can prevent and contain the pandemic threat facing the poorest countries and some of the most vulnerable children. This report should be a wake-up call for the world. Poverty is not inevitable for children,” Ashing said.The agencies said hundreds of millions of children remain multi-dimensionally poor -- meaning they lack access to health care, education, proper nutrition, or adequate housing -- often a reflection of inequitable investments by governments in social services. In order to address and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on children in poor households, Save the Children and the UNICEF call for rapid and large-scale expansion of social protection systems and programmes including cash transfers, school feeding and child benefits – all critical investments that address immediate financial needs and lay the foundation for countries to prepare for future shocks.“Governments must also invest in other forms of social protection, fiscal policies, employment and labour market interventions to support families. This includes expanding universal access to quality healthcare and other services; and investing in family friendly policies, such as paid leave and childcare,” they said.

The militants attacked a checkpoint in Parwan, north of the capital, said Waheeda Shahkar, spokeswoman to the provincial governor.“The Taliban have also suffered casualties,” Shahkar added.District police chief Hussain Shah said Taliban fighters set fire to the checkpoint, killing five security force personnel. Two more were shot dead. The Taliban have not commented.It is the first attack that Afghan officials have blamed on the Taliban since the ceasefire -- held over the Eid al-Fitr festival -- ended on Tuesday night.According to Afghanistan’s Independent Human Rights Commission, civilian casualties fell by 80 percent during the temporary truce.A drop in violence has largely held since it ended on Tuesday night, although Afghan security forces carried out air strikes in the south on Wednesday that killed 18 “militants,” police said.The surprise truce offer from the Taliban and the lull in fighting has raised hopes that stalled peace negotiations between the insurgents and the Afghan government could begin soon.Afghan authorities have responded to the ceasefire by releasing some 1,000 insurgent prisoners this week, and plan to further free an equal number of inmates in the coming days.The Taliban have also said they plan to free a group of government prisoners.The exchange is part of a US-Taliban deal signed in February, which excluded the Afghan government, that stipulates Kabul would release up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners and the militants would free about 1,000 national security personnel.Kabul had already freed about 1,000 Taliban inmates before the ceasefire, while the insurgents had released about 300 government captives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-forces-killed-in-first-taliban-attack-since-ceasefire-end-report/story-XpucsZPDVoGh7T1K2PPFRN.html

28-05-2020||World||China approves Hong Kong’s security legislation, defying Donald Trump’s threat||Chinese lawmakers approved a proposal for sweeping new national security legislation in Hong Kong, defying a threat by US President Donald Trump to respond strongly to a measure that democracy advocates say will curb essential freedoms in the city.The National People’s Congress, China’s rubber-stamp legislature, approved the draft decision by a vote of 2,878-1 on Thursday at its annual session in Beijing, with six abstentions. Chinese officials could now take months to sort of the details of laws banning subversion, secession, terrorism and foreign interference before they’re given to Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed administration to promulgate.The move to bypass the semi-autonomous city’s local Legislative Council has alarmed Hong Kong’s pro-democracy activists and opposition politicians. It risks spawning yet more protests in the city and could potentially prompt companies to flee if the laws undermine the independent judiciary in the Asian financial hub.The Trump administration on Wednesday took the significant step of saying it could no longer certify Hong Kong’s autonomy from China, which was promised before the British handed the city back in 1997. The move could trigger a range of actions by the Trump administration, from sanctions on Chinese officials to revoking the city’s special trading status with the US.President Donald Trump, asked about the possible sanctions, said Tuesday his administration was “doing something now” that he would unveil this week. Business groups“Hong Kong does not continue to warrant treatment under United States laws in the same manner as US laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1997,” Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in announcing the decision. “No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground.”What Are the New Laws China Is Pushing for Hong Kong?: QuickTakeOther governments also expressed worries about the legislation. Japan said it was “seriously concerned” by the move, while Taiwan said it would release a plan to help Hong Kong residents if they wanted to leave the city.The plan to enact the national security legislation was first announced in Beijing late last week, with Chinese officials saying it was needed to stem sometimes-violent protests that hit the city last year. They argued that Hong Kong’s lawmakers had 23 years to pass the legislation, which is mandated under Hong Kong’s mini-constitution called the Basic Law.“All of the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people and international investors will remain unchanged,” Hong Kong’s government said in a statement on Wednesday. It said the laws wouldn’t erode the rule of law, an independent judiciary or freedom of expression.Hong Kong’s democracy camp isn’t convinced, however. While last year’s protests all but stopped during the pandemic, demonstrators came out multiple times since the announcement on the laws, defying police who are still limiting public gatherings. Some of them chanted for independence, a clear red line that Beijing has used to justify passing the laws.Hong Kong Police Overwhelm Protesters Now Crying ‘Independence’Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong media tycoon and prominent pro-democracy activist, said the laws could push business away and eventually turn anyone who participates in a demonstration into a criminal.“It’s like a knife on top of our head,” Lai told Bloomberg Television. “Anytime it will come to our neck.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-approves-hong-kong-s-security-legislation-defying-donald-trump-s-threat/story-BrzUk0Nrke1CTK6ndtKcFI.html
28-05-2020||World||Pakistan uses militant-tracking tech to hunt virus||Pakistan’s intelligence services are deploying secretive surveillance technology normally used to locate militants to instead track coronavirus patients and the people they come into contact with.In a programme publicly touted by Prime Minister Imran Khan, the government has turned to the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI) for help in tackling the virus, which still is spreading at an accelerating rate across Pakistan.Details about the project have not been released, but two officials told AFP that intelligence services are using geo-fencing and phone-monitoring systems that ordinarily are employed to hunt high-value targets including homegrown and foreign militants.A lack of awareness, stigma and fear have contributed to some people with symptoms not seeking treatment or even fleeing hospitals, while others who’ve had contact with virus patients have flouted self-isolation rules.Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior security official told AFP that agencies are now “quite effectively” using the technology to track coronavirus cases.“The government has been successful in tracing even those who tested positive but went into hiding,” the security official said.Geo-fencing, a discreet tracking system that alerts authorities when someone leaves a specific geographic area, has helped officials monitor neighbourhoods on lockdown.Authorities are also listening in to the calls of Covid-19 patients to monitor whether their contacts are talking about having symptoms.“The trace-and-track system basically helps us track the mobile phones of corona patients as well as anyone they get in touch with before of after their disappearance,” an intelligence official said.Khan recently praised the programme, which has come up against little public debate or scrutiny over its use in the virus fight. “It was originally used against terrorism, but now it is has come in useful against coronavirus,” he said.Nearly 60,000 people in Pakistan have tested positive for the disease and more than 1,200 patients have died. But with testing still limited, officials worry the true numbers are much higher.ConcernsPakistan’s intelligence services and military hold vast sway over many aspects of cultural and political life, with the US and India accusing Islamabad of backing insurgents fighting in Kashmir and Afghanistan -- claims denied by officials.Rights groups worry authorities might abuse their sweeping surveillance powers to trace political dissidents.Leading rights activist and ex-senator Afrasiab Khattak told AFP that involving the ISI would spread unnecessary fear among the population.“The task of tracking and tracing the patients and suspected cases should be dealt with by provincial governments and local communities -- let intelligence agencies do their actual job,” he said.Countries across the world have employed track-and-trace methods to control the virus’s spread, raising privacy concerns.Israel’s intelligence services have been using counter-terrorism technology, including tracking mobile phones, prompting the Supreme Court to raise privacy concerns.In Pakistan, authorities struggled to present a cohesive national strategy to control the coronavirus. Khan was reluctant to call for a sweeping lockdown, arguing the impoverished country could not afford it. He also largely caved to pressure from Pakistan’s powerful religious lobby, which pushed back against the closure of mosques.Many Pakistanis have simply ignored provincial lockdown orders and Khan has allowed businesses to reopen in phases, citing the economic impact on daily wage earners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-uses-militant-tracking-tech-to-hunt-virus/story-RMdeSrsF5LsRPUSziNm73H.html

The resort will suspend parades, fireworks displays and other activities that create crowds. It will “enable and encourage” contactless payment systems, and expand its existing mobile order systems in restaurants.Disney plans to restrict the number of guests, who will be required to reserve their park passes ahead of time. Park guests will be greeted by signs such as “HELP US PROTECT THE MAGIC PLEASE LIMIT HANDLING OF THE PRODUCT, IF ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED, PLEASE ASK A CAST MEMBER.” Starting in January, Disney closed theme parks around the world to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.On Wednesday, Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Chapek told CNBC the company currently has about 20,000 people per day visiting Shanghai Disneyland, which reopened on May 11 with mandatory masks, temperature screenings and social distancing for visitors and employees. Disney will soon reveal plans for reopening its Anaheim, California, Disneyland amusement park, the company’s original themed attraction, according to a company spokeswoman.Welcoming visitors again to its parks is key to Disney’s recovery from the global shutdowns sparked by the pandemic. Disney has estimated it lost $1 billion (816.2 million pounds) at its theme parks division from January through March.Disney’s four Walt Disney World theme parks attracted 157.3 million visitors in 2018, according to the Themed Entertainment Association trade group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/disney-may-reopen-walt-disney-world-starting-on-july-11-if-governor-approves/story-5D75iBcUWSNwdpWl24MvWM.html

Tropical Storm Bertha surprised the South Carolina coast on Wednesday, forming, making landfall within two hours and was downgraded before sundown, news agency AP reported.Forecasters expected the bad weather, but didn’t predict it to organise so quickly and become the second named storm before the official start of this year’s Atlantic hurricane season.Bertha was named around 8 am on Wednesday and was onshore east of Charleston by 9:30 am. The state Department of Natural Resources called it “a sunrise surprise”. Six hours after the tropical storm formed, the National Hurricane Centre downgraded it to a depression well inland.They said Bertha was no longer a tropical depression at 5 pm and stopped issuing advisories.Bertha, however, did cause headache for NASCAR. The rain accompanying the tropical storm forced the postponement of its Cup Series race. The Alsco Uniforms 500, a 208-lap race, was rescheduled for Thursday. It will be the fourth Cup Series race since NASCAR returned to action from a two-month coronavirus shutdown 10 days ago.Less than 1,000 power outages and scattered downed trees were reported as Bertha and its 80 kmph maximum sustained winds moved onshore and into eastern South Carolina.Bertha moved rapidly inland, spreading up to 4 inches (10 centimetres) of rain into parts of North Carolina and Virginia.This is the record sixth year in a row Atlantic storms have formed before the official June 1 start of the season.Last week, Tropical Storm Arthur had formed off the US east coast before veering out to sea causing little damage. Most pre-season forecasts call for an over-active Atlantic season surpassing the long-term average of 12 systems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-bertha-forms-hits-south-carolina-coast-dissipates-in-a-day/story-DYDJKb3rm4LhZIiQTQDreP.html

28-05-2020||World||Judge sets June 4 hearing for suspects in Arbery slaying||A Georgia judge has scheduled a hearing next week for three men charged with murder in the fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, court officials said Wednesday.Glynn County Magistrate Court Judge Wallace E. Harrell set a preliminary hearing for June 4, said court clerk Luetrice Lott. The judge will determine whether authorities had sufficient evidence to charge the men in Arbery’s death.Arbery was killed Feb. 23 when a white father and son armed themselves and pursued the 25-year-old black man after spotting him running in their neighborhood just outside the port city of Brunswick. More than two months passed before Gregory McMichael, 64, and Travis McMichael, 34, were arrested May 7 on charges of felony murder and aggravated assault.A neighbor of the McMichaels, 50-year-old William “Roddie” Bryan Jr., was charged last Thursday with felony murder and criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment. Bryan is the man whose cellphone video of the shooting, which leaked online two days before the McMichaels’ arrests, ignited a national outcry over the case.All three men remain jailed pending a bond hearing before a different judge.Defense attorneys for the McMichaels have urged people not to rush to judgment in the case. Gregory McMichael told police he suspected Arbery was a burglar and that Arbery attacked his son right before being shot. Arbery’s family has said he was merely out jogging.Bryan’s attorney, Kevin Gough, has insisted his client played no role in Arbery’s death. The arrest warrant for Bryan says he used a vehicle to illegally try to “confine and detain” Arbery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-sets-june-4-hearing-for-suspects-in-arbery-slaying/story-3503Y1TCAbsCRq50VxsiBJ.html
28-05-2020||World||US Congress approves China sanctions over ethnic crackdown||Congress voted Wednesday to toughen the US response to a brutal Chinese crackdown on ethnic minorities, adding another factor to the increasingly stormy relationship between the two countries.The House passed a bipartisan bill that would impose sanctions on Chinese officials involved in the mass surveillance and detention of Uighurs and other ethnic groups in the western Xinjiang region, a campaign that has drawn muted international response because of China’s influence around the world.The measure already passed the Senate and needs a signature from President Donald Trump, who said this week he’ll “very strongly” consider it amid US anger over China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and tension over a Chinese plan to restrict civil liberties in Hong Kong.Both issues emerged, along with other sore points in the China-US relationship, as Republican and Democratic members of Congress spoke in support of the bill. No one spoke against it, and it passed by a 413-1 vote.“Beijing’s barbarous actions targeting the Uighur people are an outrage to the collective conscience of the world,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a floor speech in support of the bill.Also read: Gilgit and Xinjiang: Two tales of modern colonialism | OpinionIt was the first bill in history to pass with proxy votes after House Democrats, over Republican objections, adopted a measure allowing such votes in response to the coronavirus outbreak.Congress late last year voted to condemn the crackdown in Xinjiang, where Chinese authorities have detained more than a million people — from mostly Muslim ethnic groups that include Uighurs, Kazakhs and Kyrgyz — in a vast network of detention centers.This new legislation is intended to increase the pressure by imposing sanctions on specific Chinese officials, such as the Communist Party official who oversees government policy in Xinjiang.The legislation also requires the US government to report to Congress on violations of human rights in Xinjiang as well as China’s acquisition of technology used for mass detention and surveillance. It also provides for an assessment of the pervasive reports of harassment and threats of Uighurs and other Chinese nationals in the United States.A provision that would have imposed export restrictions on surveillance and other equipment used in the crackdown was initially passed in the House but then stripped out in the version that passed in the Senate earlier this month.Despite the limitations, the legislation amounts to the first concrete step by a government to penalize China over the treatment of the Uighurs since the existence of the mass internment camps became widely known in recent years, said Peter Irwin, a senior program officer at the Uighur Human Rights Project.“It signals that a member of the international community is actually taking some steps to address the problem,” Irwin said. “The legislation itself has to spur the rest of the international community, particularly the European Union and other powerful blocs of states, to actually take this as a template and pass their own legislation.”Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican and chairman of the House China Task Force, called what’s happening in Xinjiang a “cultural genocide” of Uighurs and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups.The passage of the bill with strong bipartisan support would “show the Chinese Communist Party and the entire world that their treatment of the Muslim Uighurs is inexcusable and will not be allowed without serious consequences,” McCaul said.China has publicly brushed away criticism of its crackdown in Xinjiang, which it launched in 2014 as the “Strike Hard Against Violent Extremism” campaign in a vast resource-rich territory whose inhabitants are largely distinct, culturally and ethnically, from the country’s Han Chinese majority.The Chinese government, when not bristling at criticism of what it sees as an internal matter, has also said the detention camps are vocational training centers. Uighur activists and human rights groups have countered that many of those held are people with advanced degrees and business owners who are influential in their communities and have no need of any special education.People held in the internment camps have described being subjected to forced political indoctrination, torture, beatings, denial of food and medicine and say they have been prohibited from practicing their religion or speaking their language. China has denied these accounts but refused to allow independent inspections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-approves-china-sanctions-over-ethnic-crackdown/story-bEpSpR2WsIaNfLIxaCIXHK.html
28-05-2020||World||Trump to sign executive order on social media on Thursday: White House||US President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on social media companies on Thursday, White House officials said after Trump threatened to shut down websites he accused of stifling conservative voices.The officials gave no further details. It was unclear how Trump could follow through on the threat of shutting down privately owned companies including Twitter Inc.The dispute erupted after Twitter on Tuesday for the first time tagged Trump’s tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact check the posts.Separately, a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals in Washington on Wednesday upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit by a conservative group and right-wing YouTube personality against Google, Facebook, Twitter and Apple accusing them of conspiring to suppress conservative political views. In an interview with Fox News Channel on Wednesday, Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said censoring a platform would not be the “right reflex” for a government worried about censorship. Fox played a clip of the interview and said it would be aired in full on Thursday.Facebook left Trump’s post on mail-in ballots on Tuesday untouched.The American Civil Liberties Union said the First Amendment of the US Constitution limits any action Trump could take.Facebook and Alphabet’s Google declined comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.“Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen,” Trump said in a pair of additional posts on Twitter on Wednesday.The president, a heavy user of Twitter with more than 80 million followers, added: “Clean up your act, NOW!!!!”Republican Trump has an eye on the November election. “Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election,” Trump tweeted on Wednesday. “If that happens, we no longer have our freedom.”STRONGEST THREAT YETTrump’s threat is his strongest yet within a broader conservative backlash against Big Tech. Shares of both Twitter and Facebook fell on Wednesday. Last year the White House circulated drafts of a proposed executive order about anti-conservative bias which never gained traction. The Internet Association, which includes Twitter and Facebook among its members, said online platforms do not have a political bias and they offer “more people a chance to be heard than at any point in history.”Late on Wednesday, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said Trump’s tweets about California’s vote-by-mail plans “may mislead people into thinking they don’t need to register to get a ballot.”Separately, Twitter said Trump’s tweets were labeled as part of efforts to enforce the company’s “civic integrity policy.” The policy document on Twitter’s website says people may not use its services for manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes.In recent years Twitter has tightened its policies amid criticism that its hands-off approach allowed fake accounts and misinformation to thrive.Tech companies have been accused of anti-competitive practices and violating user privacy. Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon.com face antitrust probes by federal and state authorities and a US congressional panel. Republican and Democratic lawmakers, along with the US Justice Department, have been considering changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a federal law largely exempting online platforms from legal liability for the material their users post. Such changes could expose tech companies to more lawsuits. Republican Senator Josh Hawley, a frequent critic of Big Tech companies, sent a letter to Dorsey asking why Twitter should continue to receive legal immunity after “choosing to editorialize on President Trump’s tweets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-to-sign-executive-order-on-social-media-on-thursday-white-house/story-lUKBCKtNXnwp7PcAkFnA6O.html
28-05-2020||World||Covid-19 could push 14 million into hunger in Latin America, says UN||The UN World Food Programme is warning that upward of at least 14 million people could go hungry in Latin America as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, shuttering people in their homes, drying up work and crippling the economy.New projections released late Wednesday estimate a startling increase: Whereas 3.4 million experienced severe food insecurity in 2019, that number could more than quadruple this year in one of the world’s most vulnerable regions.“We are entering a very complicated stage,” said Miguel Barreto, the WFP’s regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean. “It is what we are calling a hunger pandemic.” Signs of mounting hunger are already being felt around the region, where desperate citizens are violating quarantines to go out in search of money and food and hanging red and white flags from their homes in a cry for aid. Many of the hungry are informal workers who make up a sizable portion of Latin America’s workforce, while others are newly poor who have lost jobs amidst an historic economic downturn.“I am the captain of the family,” said Dieufete Lebien, 57, a now unemployed construction worker in Haiti. “A boat that is sinking.” The number of people going hungry is likely to be higher than the UN projection, which only takes into account numbers in the 11 countries where the organisation operates. The estimate does not include, for example, Venezuela, where one in every three people faced hunger last year, according to the food agency’s 2019 study.The escalating hunger comes as the Covid-19 pandemic increasingly ravages Latin America. Brazil now ranks second globally in the number of coronavirus infections, behind the US, and rising levels in Peru, Chile, Mexico and elsewhere are stretching hospitals thin, increasingly in poor urban and remote rural communities.UN food agency executive director David Beasley warned in April that an addition 130 million people could be “pushed to the brink of starvation” worldwide by the end of 2020. The new estimates for Latin America indicate the region will be especially hard hit.In Haiti, hunger could more than double, from 700,000 to 1.6 million. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants living in the Andes as well as those in Central American countries reeling from a severe drought are also expected to see levels multiply.The impact of such a sharp rise in hunger could have far-reaching implications ranging from higher levels of chronic childhood malnutrition to security issues. The WFP is calling on nations to expand their social safety net to those who traditionally don’t qualify for aid. Many governments and international organizations have been stepping up, providing cash transfers and food deliveries, but are facing logistical and economic hurdles.Local activists like Cristian Perea in Cali, Colombia, said government efforts are reaching only a fraction of those who need assistance. He recently went out delivering boxes of fruit, rice, vegetables and sugar to families who have gotten nothing and came across one 9-year-old boy who had only consumed a glass of water in the last day.“You could tell he was in need,” Perea said.Latin America and the Caribbean are expected to see a 5.3% economic contraction this year, possibly a sharper drop than during the Great Depression. That downturn comes after seven years of low growth averaging less than 0.5%.“We could enter another lost decade,” said Alicia Bárcena, chief of the U.N.’s regional economic branch, referring to a previous downturn during the 1980s that took Latin America 25 years in order to recover 1979 per-capita income levels.Latin America’s economies are in a bind, not able to borrow as freely as their European counterparts, making painful budget cuts, slashing jobs, shuttering embassies and putting state employees on part-time working schedules.“Latin American governments hardly have the resources to finance their current levels of spending,” said Sergio Guzmán, director of Colombia Risk Analysis.Alimenta la Solidaridad, a charity that operates 214 soup kitchens across Venezuela, has seen demand increase since a nationwide quarantine went into effect in mid-March. The group usually serves 14,500 meals to children daily; now an additional 5,300 boys and girls are on a waiting list hoping to get food, but supplies are limited.“The situation pains me greatly,” said Roberto Patiño, the organization’s director.Across the region, nearly 30 million more people are expected to find themselves in “situations of poverty” and another 16 million among the extreme poor, the UN estimates.The new poor include people like Yadira Montenegro, 38, a mother of three in Bogota who recently lost her job as a security guard and now eats just once a day. Her meals usually consist of potato soup or rice with a fried egg on top.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-could-push-14-million-into-hunger-in-latin-america-says-un/story-7IjuhOmUZMUoEQjbC6dqlM.html
28-05-2020||World||Inquiry into Russia probe carries political consequences||Attorney General William Barr says he doesn’t expect a criminal inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation to target former President Barack Obama or Joe Biden, the former vice president and President Donald Trump’s Democratic opponent.But that doesn’t mean the investigation, led by US Attorney John Durham of Connecticut, doesn’t carry its own political consequences. The inquiry could conclude this summer, meaning fresh revelations might be exploited by Trump in the heat of the election season to damage Biden or to attack the Obama administration.Buoyed by the Justice Department’s decision to dismiss the case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn and by the ongoing declassification of Russia-related material, Trump and his allies have looked to Durham’s investigation as the last opportunity to hold accountable officials they say wronged the president. Former Obama administration officials, meanwhile, find themselves scrutinized for actions they took four years ago while investigating Russian election interference.A look at where things stand:What exactly is the investigation about?Durham is a veteran federal prosecutor with decades of Justice Department experience. He’s investigated FBI corruption related to the handling of Boston mobster Whitey Bulger and later the CIA’s harsh overseas interrogations of terror suspects.He was named last year by Barr to investigate the origins of the Russia investigation.Durham’s investigation is one of multiple inquiries the department has undertaken in connection with the FBI’s probe into potential coordination between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign. Those include an internal review of the Justice Department’s handling of the Flynn investigation, and an inspector general report that was issued last December.Unlike those inquiries, which were focused on Justice Department employees, Durham’s mandate is much broader, spanning the activities of the CIA and other agencies across government.Durham has been scrutinizing the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia interfered in the election in support of Trump, and what information the government had when it reached that conclusion.Barr has said the inquiry is far broader than just the FBI’s flawed applications to monitor a former Trump campaign adviser, and covers actions taken after the election, too.Are any of the recently reported developments under investigation? Yes. Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said Wednesday night on Fox News that Durham’s investigation will include a review of unmasking requests during the course of the Russia investigation.The issue gained attention earlier this month when newly declassified information showed that multiple intelligence and Obama administration officials asked the National Security Agency to disclose to them, or unmask, the name of an American that had been concealed in classified intelligence reports. That American was revealed to be Flynn.Kupec said John Bash, a US attorney in Texas who previously worked inside the Trump White House, has been selected to specifically review the issue.Names of American citizens are routinely redacted from intelligence reports that are produced when the US conducts surveillance of foreigners. But US officials can ask to receive the identity if they believe it’s vital to understanding the intelligence, which is apparently what happened in Flynn’s case in 2016 and 2017.Kupec acknowledged that unmasking isn’t inherently wrong — in fact, requests have been more common in the first years of the Trump administration than they were at the end of Obama’s tenure — but said “the frequency, the motivation and the reasoning” behind an unmasking request can be problematic.What is its current status?Barr has hinted at a resolution as soon as this summer, though precisely when the investigation will end is an open question.Over the course of months, Durham has conducted interviews and spoken with government figures in the US and abroad, traveling last year with Barr to meet Italian government officials. In a pattern with unmistakable echoes of special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, current and former officials have lined up a who’s who of Washington attorneys to navigate them through the probe.Though the work continues, it is unclear how much it has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic, which has restricted travel and complicated access to some government buildings in the Washington area.What has Durham said about the investigation?Not much. But his main public statement — coming just after Inspector General Michael Horowitz issued a report saying the Russia investigation had been opened for a legitimate basis — was telling.In the statement, released through the Justice Department, Durham said he disagreed with the inspector general about the investigation being properly predicated. Horowitz has acknowledged that Durham disputed that there was a sufficient basis to open a full investigation, which gives the FBI more intrusive tools than a preliminary one.Barr has been public that the investigation is now criminal in nature while Trump and his allies, inside and outside the White House, frequently attack by name former officials who they see as deserving targets of Durham’s scrutiny.On Tuesday, White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany lambasted former CIA Director John Brennan, claiming he had shaded the truth by saying a dossier of information about Trump’s ties to Russia played no part in the opening of the investigation. In fact, the investigation was started without the dossier.How might Trump use the Durham investigation? Trump and his supporters hope the investigation will uncover misconduct and support the president’s claims that the Russia investigation was a “witch hunt.” Even after Horowitz released a comprehensive report on the origins of the investigation, Trump insisted Americans should be more interested in Durham’s probe.Trump is likely to seize on any modicum of questionable activity during the counterintelligence probe, which morphed into Mueller’s investigation. Mueller concluded that the Russian government interfered in the election, but his investigation didn’t find sufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump’s campaign and Russia. Mueller also examined multiple possible instances of obstruction of justice and pointedly said he could not exonerate the president.How will the investigation end?Barr has mentioned that there could be not only a written report, similar to a document produced after Mueller’s probe, but also criminal charges. But neither he nor Durham has said who could wind up charged, or if anyone will be.Barr said last week that despite calls by Trump and some of his supporters for Obama and Biden to be investigated, he did not expect either man to become targets of Durham’s probe.“Our concern over potential criminality,” he said, “is focused on others.”Though Justice Department policy cautions against overt investigative actions in the run-up to an election, Barr has said that policy would not apply here since Durham’s investigation isn’t targeting a candidate. That raises the possibility that a criminal charge, or significant development, could be revealed in the crucial weeks prior to the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/inquiry-into-russia-probe-carries-political-consequences/story-nijX4HVIP27MNaBJarLnHO.html
28-05-2020||World||US deaths from coronavirus surpass 100,000 milestone||The US has surpassed a jarring milestone in the coronavirus pandemic: 100,000 deaths.That number is the best estimate and most assuredly an undercount. But it represents the stark reality that more Americans have died from the virus than from the Vietnam and Korea wars combined.“It is a grim milestone,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy with the Kaiser Family Foundation in Washington. “It’s a striking reminder of how dangerous this virus can be.” Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 5.6 million people and killed over 350,000, with the US having the most confirmed cases and deaths by far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Europe has recorded about 170,000 deaths, while the US reached more than 100,000 in less than four months.The true death toll from the virus, which emerged in China late last year and was first reported in the US in January, is widely believed to be significantly higher, with experts saying many victims died of Covid-19 without ever being tested for it.At the end March, the United States eclipsed China with 3,500 deaths. Now, the US has not only the highest death total, but the highest number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the world, making up more than 30 per cent of the global total.Early on, President Donald Trump downplayed the severity of the coronavirus and called it no worse than the common flu. He previously predicted the country wouldn’t reach this death toll. As early as March, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, was warning that Covid-19 could claim more than 100,000 lives in the US.“I think we’ll be substantially under that number,” Trump said on April 10. Ten days later, he said, “We’re going toward 50- or 60,000 people.” Ten days after that: “We’re probably heading to 60,000, 70,000.” Critics have said deaths spiked because Trump was slow to respond, but he has contended on Twitter that it could have been 20 times higher without his actions. He has urged states to reopen their economies after months of stay-at-home restrictions.The virus exacted an especially vicious toll on Trump’s hometown of New York City and its surrounding suburbs, killing more than 21,000. At the peak, hundreds of people were dying per day in New York City, and hospitals, ambulances and first responders were inundated with patients.The densely packed New York metropolitan area, consisting of about 20 million people across a region that encompasses the city’s northern suburbs, Long Island and northern New Jersey, has been the hardest-hit corner of the country, accounting for at least one-third of the nation’s deaths.There is no vaccine or treatment for Covid-19, though several emergency treatments are being used after showing some promise in preliminary testing.Worldwide, about a dozen vaccine candidates are starting to be tested or getting close to it. Health officials have said studies of a potential vaccine might be done by late this year or early next year.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.Among the 100,000 deaths was 74-year-old Michael Ganci, a resident of Newington, Connecticut, who died March 21. He was a public school teacher, a grandfather and father of four, and a 4th-degree belt Sensei in Kyokushin karate.Ganci, who had a compromised immune system, died at St. Francis Hospital in Hartford three days after showing symptoms. His family was not allowed to be with him and tried to text and talk with him on his cellphone during his final days. His wife of 48 years also tested positive for Covid-19 and was forced to grieve alone.For their daughter, 45-year-old Joanna Ganci of Beverly, Massachusetts, the milestone and other statistics are important to understand the scope of the virus.“But at the same time, I think the danger of counting, the danger of statistics, is that it just minimizes the human element,” she said. “And I think, again, we see that our country is in the throes of this kind of moment of just that the numbers don’t seem to mean anything anyway to many. It’s like, what number is going to make an impact for people who haven’t been touched by it?” “For people whose lives haven’t been threatened or where the virus hasn’t been as rampant through a community, I just think numbers or not, it’s still so abstract to so many people,” she said. “It doesn’t matter if it’s 200,000, 100,000 or 10. It doesn’t mean anything until you’re personally affected by it.” From Jan. 1 through the end of April, the US saw at least 66,000 more overall deaths than in similar periods for previous years, an increase of around 7 per cent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The coronavirus was reported as a cause in about half the excess deaths, but experts also believe the virus was likely a factor in many others. Coroners caution that deaths from other causes are likely up, too, including those from drug overdoses and among people who delayed treatment for problems like heart attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-deaths-from-coronavirus-surpass-100-000-milestone/story-TBVPp6HZk7PPm3lahGuyIN.html
28-05-2020||World||Iran’s president pushes for harsher laws on honour killings||Iran’s president urged his Cabinet on Wednesday to speed up harsher laws in so-called honor killings, after a particularly disturbing slaying of a 14-year-old girl by her father shocked the nation.President Hassan Rouhani pushed for speedy adoption of relevant bills, some which have apparently shuttled for years among various decision-making bodies in Iran.The killing of teen Romina Ashrafi last week in the Iranian town of Talesh, some 320 kilometers (198 miles) northwest of the capital, Tehran, prompted a nationwide outcry. She was reportedly beheaded while sleeping by her father, Reza Ashrafi, who used a farming sickle to kill his daughter.The father, who is now in custody, was apparently enraged after she ran away with her 34-year-old boyfriend Bahamn Khavari in Talesh. In rural areas of Iran, it’s unheard of for teenage girls to run away from home to be with their boyfriends.After five days, Romina was found and taken to a police station, from where her father brought her back home. The girl reportedly told the police she feared a violent reaction from her father.Rouhani expressed regret over the tragic case.There is little data on honor killings in Iran, where local media occasionally report on such cases. Under the law, girls can marry after the age of 13, though the average age of marriage for Iranian women is 23. It is not known how many women and young girls are killed by family members or close relatives because of their actions, perceived as violating conservative Islamic norms on love and marriage.Iran’s judiciary said Romina’s case will be tried in a special court. Under the current law, her father faces a prison sentence of up to 10 years.Iran’s vice-president in charge of family affairs, Masoumeh Ebtekar, expressed hope that a bill with harsher punishments will soon be in the final stages of approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-president-pushes-for-harsher-laws-on-honour-killings/story-FCxbtCTemia3CGNDXZDj0O.html

Hossain said an official order was expected to be issued on Thursday announcing the government decision. “We have obtained Prime Minister’s (Sheikh Hasina) approval in this regard,” he said.Since its enforcement on March 26, coinciding with the Independence Day anniversary, the shutdown was extended in six phases until May 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-won-t-extend-covid-19-lockdown-post-may-30-report/story-R9UoxhhwAmAHeUHylwVkyJ.html

The president’s overall popularity has been about the same for more than a year.Trump’s likely Democratic opponent in the Nov. 3 election, former Vice President Joe Biden, has a higher favorability with registered voters despite a slight dip from last week. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has a six-point net lead in support over Trump, down about three points from last week.Trump has been widely criticized for the federal government’s response to the pandemic, which has battered the economy and led more than 38 million Americans to file for unemployment benefits.The president has accused Democratic governors -- without any evidence -- of keeping states locked down to damage the economy and hurt his chances in the November election.Some states have begun to relax stay-at-home guidelines while health experts warn that ending the orders too early or without sufficient precautions could cause a second deadly wave of the virus.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 4,429 American adults, including 3,732 who identified as registered voters. It had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of plus or minus 2 percentage points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/approval-of-trump-s-pandemic-response-stays-steady-biden-favored-in-election-report/story-7FLcqjxLAA6FoGmHwoabUO.html

Bangladesh through Citizenship Act, border disputes with Nepal & China, & Pak threatened with false flag operation,” Khan said in a series of tweets.Several areas along the 3,500-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh and North Sikkim have witnessed major military build-up by both the Indian and Chinese armies recently, in a clear signal of escalating tension and hardening of respective positions by the two sides even two weeks after they were engaged in two separate face-offs.The LAC is the de-facto border between India and China.Pakistan and China consider their relations as all-weather friends and their leaders often express support to each other on matters of core interests. Khan further alleged that India had “illegally annexed” Kashmir and dubbed it as “a war crime”.Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on August 5 and bifurcating it into two Union territories.India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 was its internal matter. It also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda.Khan in his tweet said that the Indian government is “not only a threat to the country’s minorities, but also a threat to regional peace.” Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi also alleged that India’s “aggressive policy towards its neighbours is putting at stake the regional peace and security.” Meanwhile, the Foreign Office on Wednesday rejected as “misleading and factually incorrect” the media reports about the virtual meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Ambassadors to the United Nations on May 20.It said that during the meeting, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN highlighted the growing Islamophobia and violence against Muslims in India. The FO statement said that “sharing the growing concern over serious implications of Islamophobia in India, a large number of OIC Ambassadors supported the need for a coordinated OIC position on Islamophobia at the UN.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-says-india-s-arrogant-expansionist-policies-is-threatening-its-neighbours/story-l6PK8NcLgrRtIZDPfoRuhI.html

The waivers had allowed Russian, European and Chinese companies to continue to work on Iran’s civilian nuclear facilities without drawing American penalties.The waivers were last renewed at the end of March and are due to expire at the end of the week. The revocations will give foreign companies 60 days to wind down their operations, according to the officials, who were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. A formal announcement was expected on Thursday.Pompeo in March had opposed extending the waivers, which are among the few remaining components of the nuclear deal that the administration has not canceled. But officials said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had prevailed in an internal debate by arguing the coronavirus pandemic made eliminating the waivers unpalatable at a time when the administration is being criticized for refusing to ease sanctions to deal with the outbreak.President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018 and has steadily reimposed U.S. sanctions on Iran that had been eased or lifted under its terms. The “civilian-nuclear cooperation” waivers allow foreign companies to do work at some of Iran’s declared nuclear sites without becoming subject to U.S. sanctions.Deal supporters say the waivers give international experts a valuable window into Iran’s atomic program that might otherwise not exist. They also say some of the work, particularly at the Tehran reactor on nuclear isotopes that can be used in medicine, is humanitarian in nature.But Iran critics in Congress have pressed Pompeo to eliminate all the waivers, saying they should be revoked because they give Iran access to technology that could be used for weapons. These critics strenuously objected to the waiver that allowed work at Iran’s once-secret Fordow facility, which is built into a mountain.Pompeo canceled that waiver in mid-December but the others, which permit work at the Bushehr nuclear power station, the Arak heavy water plant and the Tehran Research Reactor, had been kept in place until now. The waiver for work at Bushehr will be the only one extended for 90 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-revoke-iran-nuclear-cooperation-sanctions-waivers/story-ke8HnFghB89e6VebLdsaAN.html
28-05-2020||World||Donald Trump’s mediation tweet is part of growing anti-China juggernaut||President Donal Trump on Wednesday said he has offered to arbitrate the India-China border dispute in what is being seen as move that will irk Beijing more than New Delhi, given the steadily rising hostility and antipathy towards China in the United States over the Covid-19 outbreak, which comes on top of months of differences over trade and mounting irritation over theft of intellectual property.“We have informed both India and China that the United States is ready, willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute,” Trump wrote in a tweet Wednesday morning.The United States has been closely watching the latest flare-up on the India-China border, and had sided with India in its first official response. The flare-ups were a “reminder that Chinese aggression is not always just rhetorical”.,” Alice Wells, the top US diplomat for South and Central Asia had told reporters last week.ALSO WATCH | India-China tension | Donald Trump’s offer, more troops at LAC: All updates“Whether it’s in the South China Sea or whether it’s along the border with India, we continue to see provocations and disturbing behaviour by China that raises questions about how China seeks to use its growing power,” she had added.There were no followup pronouncements from the US since, till the morning tweet from the president, with his offer to mediate. No official explanation was forthcoming of the president’s new offer and it was not clear if either India and China had asked the American leader to intervene. A response is awaited from the White House to a request for more information.But people closely involved with India-US discussions and developments said the president’s tweet conformed to continuing hardening of his antipathy for China, driven by powerful China hawks in the administration,.“It’s a move to poke the Chinese, surely,” said a person familiar with these matters, “much like a class teacher calling two squabbling students.” China believes it belongs to a more senior class, argument goes, and will not take kindly to being “monitored” with India by a higher authority.“Think how Indians feel when someone offers to arbitrate their dispute with Pakistan,” it was said.India will reject the president’s offer as it has rejected all third-party mediation in any of its international disputes as a matter a policy, which has widespread bipartisan endorsement from all political parties. It had earlier rejected President Trump’s offer to mediate the dispute with Pakistan within minutes of it being made, at the urging of Prime Minister Imran Khan.”President Trump and his Republican allies have been attacking China relentlessly over the Covid-19 outbreak, in a bid to hold it responsible also for its spread in America, which is now the epicenter of the pandemic with the most cases and fatalities.Trump has called for an independent investigation into the origin of the outbreak — American officials have suggested the virus might have leaked from a virology lab in Wuhan — and China’s handling of it, including the exact magnitude of the devastation their, accusing Beijing of covering it up.On Tuesday the president told reporters to expect the announcement of an “interesting” action against China, regarding developments in Hong Kong, where protests have broken out against Beijing’s attempt to criminalize disrespect to the national flag. He did not specify. “We’re doing something now. I think you’ll find it very interesting, but I won’t be talking about it today,” he said responding to a question if he was contemplating sanctions.In recent weeks, the Trump administration has severely restricted US stay of Chinese journalists deemed working for state-run outfits and announced alerts for its pharmaceutical companies and research institutions working on Covid-19 vaccine and therapeutics about Chinese attempts to steal their work through cyber-hacking.Close Trump allies on Capital Hill have been calling for restricting Chinese students only to certain course in institutions of higher studies. “It’s a scandal to me that we have trained so many of the Chinese communists,” Senator Tom Cotton said recently. “If Chinese students want to come here and learn Shakespeare and the Federalist Papers—that’s what they need to learn from America; they don’t need to learn quantum computing and artificial intelligence from America.”About About two-thirds of Americans — 66% — have an unfavourable view of China, according to a new study by the Pew Research Center, conducted in March. “This is the most negative rating for the country since the Center began asking the question in 2005 and is up nearly 20 percentage points since the start of the Trump administration. (January 2017),” research body said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ready-willing-and-able-to-mediate-tweets-trump-on-india-china-border-row/story-0Sc0VkxGEVW6w34yrcuA4N.html
