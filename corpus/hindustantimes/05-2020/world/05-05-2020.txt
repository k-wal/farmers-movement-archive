Its forecast is twice its previous projection of 72,433 over the same period.“The revised projections reflect rising mobility in most US states as well as the easing of social distancing measures expected in 31 states by May 11, indicating that growing contacts among people will promote transmission of the coronavirus,” it said in a statement.At least 42 states have begun piecemeal reopening of their economy, businesses such as hair and nail saloons, gyms, restaurants, bowling alleys and some department stores; some have also announced plans to resume schools and allow construction and manufacturing concerns to reopen in coming days.Public health officials and experts have cautioned against rushing the reopening in violation of federal guidelines that have laid down phases separated by “gating” measures to determine if a community is ready to move from one stage to the next. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House task force on the coronavirus outbreak, has warned about “leapfrogging”.President Trump seemed unfazed by the dire predictions. He told reporters before leaving for Arizona to tour a mask-making factory, that both models were based on the assumption of no mitigation efforts. “That assumes no mitigation and we’re going to have mitigation,” he said of the IHME forecast.The IHME model had started out past March forecasting more than 82,000 Covid-19 by August, but it had significantly lowered it to around 60,000 in April it based on social-distancing measures put in force in most states. It has now scaled it up to twice its earlier projection.The projection is also double the current US toll of 68,934, up by 1,240 in the last 24 hours; infections went up to 1.18 million with 22,335 new cases over the same period.The daily toll is projected to go up significantly to 3,000 by June 1, according to the draft government report, which was first reported by New York Times and has been since disowned by the White House, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is said to have created it for the he Federal Emergency Management Agency, and researchers of the Johns Hopkins University who created the model. The number of cases are projected to jump to 200,000 a day, according to this report.Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who created the model, told Washington Post that projections were work in progress and finished data would differ. But, he warned, the number of daily infections could go to 100,000 and much would depend on political decisions being taken now. “There are reopening scenarios where it could get out of control very quickly,” Lessler was quoted as saying.President Trump has aggressively pushed for reopening the country and a return to normalcy with an eye on his re-election, even as he has had to temper his display of optimism by continuously revising upwards his own assessment of fatalities — he is now saying it can hit 100,000.The White House dismissed the report. “This is not a White House document nor has it been presented to the Coronavirus Task Force or gone through interagency vetting,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. “This data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the task force or data that the task force has analyzed. The president’s phased guidelines to open up America again are a scientific driven approach that the top health and infectious disease experts in the federal government agreed with. The health of the American people remains President Trump’s top priority and that will continue as we monitor the efforts by states to ease restrictions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/researchers-forecast-huge-spike-in-us-covid-19-fatalities-due-to-easing-of-curbs/story-gYOPgq6r9ovNODxFuH2IRN.html
05-05-2020||World||As Donald Trump resumes travel, staff takes risks to prepare trip||For much of the last two months, President Donald Trump has rarely left the grounds of the White House as he’s dealt with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic and sought to minimize his own exposure to the disease.But that changes Tuesday, when Trump is scheduled to travel to Arizona to visit a Honeywell facility that makes N95 masks in what the president suggests will mark the return to more regular travel.The trip also means a small army of advisers, logistical experts and security staff — a coterie of hundreds that includes personnel from the White House, Defense Department, Secret Service and more — will resume regularly hitting the road again and taking a measure of risk to assist Trump.Besides Tuesday’s trip to Honeywell, Trump says he will travel soon to Ohio, to New York in June for the U.S. Military Academy graduation and to South Dakota in July for a holiday fireworks display at Mount Rushmore. Trump says he’s also eager to get back on the campaign trail, though he acknowledged during a Fox News forum Sunday that he might not be able to hold his signature big-stadium rallies until the final months before the Nov. 3 election.“I’ve been at the White House now for many months, and I’d like to get out, as much as I love this. ... Most beautiful house in the world,” Trump said in announcing his travel plans.At a moment when public health officials have asked Americans to postpone nonessential travel to help stem the coronavirus, Trump is looking to rev the engines of Air Force One as he tries to prod a shell-shocked American electorate — reeling from the death and economic destruction wrought by the virus — to edge back to normal life.But White House officials are also taking precautions to try to prevent Trump and Vice President Mike Pence from exposure to the virus. Honeywell workers who meet Trump on Tuesday — just like anyone else who comes in close proximity to the president and vice president — will be first required to take a rapid point-of-care test to determine if they’re carrying the virus.“When preparing for and carrying out any travel, the White House’s operational teams work together to ensure plans to incorporate current CDC guidance and best practices for limiting COVID-19 exposure are followed to the greatest extent possible,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said.But Matt Bennett, who served as Vice President Al Gore’s trip director, said he worries that Trump is putting his staff, military personnel and local and state officials at unnecessary risk.“I think there is a value of seeing our leaders out in the country and escaping the White House,” said Bennett, executive vice president at the center-left think tank Third Way. “But it has to be balanced against the cost. The cost here could be the health and safety of a lot of people.”James McCann, a Purdue University political scientist who has studied presidential travel, said that Trump early in his term traveled significantly less frequently on official presidential business compared to his four predecessors. But now that a big campaign rally is not possible, Trump is searching for a way to assert himself.“Trump is itching to get into campaign mode,” McCann said.Marc Short, Pence’s chief of staff, told reporters the vice president, who last week traveled to Indiana and Minnesota, has been debriefing the White House Military Office after each trip to discuss planning and protocols.Typically, White House advance staff fly commercial airlines when traveling to scout a location before a presidential or vice presidential visit. But Short said staffers are now taking military aircraft. Ahead of Pence’s trip to an Indiana plant where ventilators are being manufactured, advance staffers were not allowed to leave the military base where Air Force Two landed, Short said.The Secret Service, which is tasked with protecting the president and his family, wouldn’t get into the details of how it’s altering operations but said it’s following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance.“Since the beginning of this pandemic, the Secret Service has been working with all of our public safety partners and the White House Medical Unit to ensure the safety and security of both our protected persons and our employees,” said Justine Whelan, a spokeswoman for the agency.In addition to the White House advance staff, which is tasked with plotting out the smallest details of the president’s visit, the Secret Service sends its own advance team that maps out security for the visit. Officials from the White House communications office advance team are dispatched to set security telephone access for the president should he need it.The president flies on Air Force One, military-operated aircraft, on all trips, regardless of whether it is White House business, political or personal travel. The Defense Department also airlifts equipment such as armored limousines and occasionally helicopters for the president’s travel.The Military Working Dog Program and Explosive Ordnance Disposal Program are dispatched to support protection of the president. Typically, about a dozen members of the news media travel with the president on Air Force One at their organization’s expense.The president usually travels with a representative from the press office, the chief of staff’s office and the National Security Council, as well as a personal assistant. Other aides, like his economic advisers, a Cabinet secretary or lawmakers, also may join depending on the nature of the visit.Johanna Maska, who served as the White House director of press advance during the Obama administration, said it’s important for administration officials to remember that everyone who travels or assists in the president’s travel — from the closest aides to the volunteer van drivers who drive lower-rung aides from the airport — have families.“There is a whole orbit around those people,” Maska said. “I certainly hope that they are making the right decisions here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-donald-trump-resumes-travel-staff-takes-risks-to-prepare-trip/story-HUf4fKzM8y5JrUZE25GJTK.html

Malls were popular and crowded destinations before the pandemic. They are also drivers of revenue for big Thai conglomerates such as Central Group and TCC Group.Officials reported one additional coronavirus case and no new deaths Tuesday, in a further sign that Thailand’s outbreak is ebbing. The number of detected infections stands at 2,988. Fatalities have remained at 54 for about a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-may-impose-a-two-hour-limit-on-shopping-mall-visits/story-n6M5zC4j3tSjL23EKjE3JL.html

In March, Israeli daily Ha’aretz, quoting medical sources, had reported that scientists at the institute had made a significant breakthrough in understanding the biological mechanism and qualities of the virus, including better diagnostic capability, production of antibodies for those who already have the virus and development of a vaccine. It was not immediately clear if the breakthrough presented to Bennett was in addition to progress that was reported in late March, and no further details were provided. The statement also did not specify whether human trials were conducted.Apparently, the IIBR conducted some clinical trials, PTI has learnt.The researchers have identified the protein that is efficient in killing the virus in patient’s body, and the institute would be publishing a paper soon about the findings.The IIBR was established in 1952 as part of the Israel Defence Forces’ Science Corps, and later became a civilian organization. It is technically under the supervision of the Prime Minister’s Office, but is in close communication with the Defence Ministry. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is said to have ordered the institute to devote resources to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 on February 1.The Defence Ministry in March had denied any breakthrough simply stating that “if and when there will be something to report, it will be done in an orderly fashion”, the Defence Ministry told Ha’aretz at the time.“The biological institute is a world-renowned research and development agency, which relies on experienced researchers and scientists with great knowledge and quality infrastructures. There are now more than 50 experienced scientists working at the institute on researching and developing a medical remedy for the virus”, it had said.The normal process of development of such a vaccine requires a long process of pre-clinical trials on animals, followed by clinical trials. This period allows for a full characterization of side effects and a better understanding of how different populations are affected.Five shipments of virus samples arrived in Israel from Japan, Italy and other countries, news portal Ynet reported in February. They were brought by a specially secured Defence Ministry courier to IIBR and had been frozen at -80 degrees Celsius. There has been intensive work, including by leading experts, to develop the vaccine since then. Experts believe that the length of time needed to develop a vaccine runs from a few months to a year and a half. Numerous research teams all over the world are participating in the race to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. Many of them at this point are focusing on the way the virus presents itself in animals, with the biggest hurdle being the way it morphs when it moves from animals to human beings. China released the genetic sequence of the virus on open scientific databases shortly after its outbreak in January so that research institutes and commercial companies could try to develop treatments and vaccines without requiring to obtain samples. Many private companies have also made claims of having successfully developed treatment against COVID-19, but there isn’t a proven track record on display yet. The novel coronavirus, which first emerged in China in late December, has so far killed over 2.5 lakh people and infected more than 3.6 million globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/significant-breakthrough-in-developing-antibody-against-covid-19-israel-s-defence-minister/story-3KI9V7tiqPhMbpXrqsROgK.html

Italy’s death toll is reported to be 29,029.The realistic UK-wide figure is over 30,000, since the ONS figure does not include deaths in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner said the new figures made Johnson’s recent claim of having ‘past the peak’ meaningless.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageHowever, Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, warned against international comparisons. She told MPs: “It is extremely difficult to compare between countries at the moment. We need to not just look at the numbers clearly, but at the rates”.“The obvious one is age and standardised death rates per million population. Those are not the numbers that are routinely reported, so it is really difficult to do direct comparisons.”The Johnson government faced continuing criticism on lack of testing in initial stages. Harries admitted there was ‘lack of capacity’ to test, adding: “If we had unlimited capacity we would have done (it) differently”.The government on Tuesday published a cache of documents from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), whose recommendations have been driving lockdown and other measures. The group comprises mainly experts from various disciplines.The Johnson government was widely criticised in the initial stages for adopting a ‘herd immunity’ approach, but quickly abandoned it when expert modelling suggested it could lead to over 5 lakh deaths. It has since denied ‘herd immunity’ was ever government policy.A new app to track and trace was introduced in the Isle of Wight on Tuesday, before its UK-wide rollout. Johnson is to announce steps to ease the lockdown on Sunday, but House of Commons speaker Lindsay Hoyle said such major announcements should be made in parliament first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-over-30-000-covid-19-deaths-uk-now-worst-hit-in-europe/story-nOAkUZWs2dhPVitMYJR5zL.html

The antibody or passive vaccine attacks the virus and neutralises it in the body.“The Jewish creativity and ingenuity brought about this amazing achievement,” he further said in the statement.Bennett’s statement was released after he visited the labs of the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR), a secretive unit that works under the Prime Minister’s Office. The scientists there told him that the development phase of the vaccine has been complete.IIBR Director Shmuel Shapira said that the antibody formula was being patented, after which an international manufacturer would be sought to mass-produce it.The IIBR has been leading Israeli efforts to develop a treatment and vaccine for the coronavirus, including the testing of blood from those who recovered from Covid-19.Antibodies in such samples - immune-system proteins that are residues of successfully overcoming the coronavirus - are widely seen as a key to developing a possible cure. A second Israeli research team, MigVax, has also reported that it is close to completing the first phase of development of a coronavirus vaccine. Last week, it secured a US $12 million investment to accelerate the path to clinical trials.Israel was one of the first countries to close its borders and impose increasingly stringent restrictions on movement to hamper the domestic coronavirus outbreak. It has reported 16,246 cases and 235 deaths from the illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-treatment-israel-s-secret-lab-isolates-coronavirus-antibody-minister-calls-it-significant-breakthrough/story-sqm0IzCBYNSTGnGW10xP3L.html

05-05-2020||World||75 years after WWII, search continues for missing soldiers||Thomas Siepert looks across the verdant grain field, glowing in the sun after a spring thunderstorm, as windmills slowly churn in the distance.Wild boar piglets trundle across the road into town and a hare pops out and dashes away. Yet the serene scene belies the slaughter there 75 years ago as German troops fought furiously — and futilely — to stave off the Soviet Red Army that was approaching the Nazi capital.“It seems so idyllic, but it’s a huge cemetery,” Siepert said. “That shouldn’t be forgotten.”But for decades, many of those who died there were forgotten, some buried where they fell and others dragged by civilians in the months after the war into trenches and foxholes they had themselves dug, and covered over.For the last 15 years, volunteers like Siepert from around Europe have been trying to rectify that, devoting vacations to excavating long-buried trench lines and military positions in the search for those who never made it home.During 19 digs across a square kilometer (less than half a square mile), members of the Association for the Recovery of the Fallen in Eastern Europe have found 116 German and 129 Soviet soldiers.They seek to identify as many as possible — to provide closure for families, to give the dead their names back, and to separate them from the numbers in the history books in the hope of explaining the cost of war to future generations.“On all sides, these are destroyed lives. These are all people who died senselessly,” said Albrecht Laue, chairman of the association. “If we talk about a huge slaughter with hundreds of thousands of dead, nobody can understand that. But if I talk about the story of a young 17-year-old soldier, that’s tangible.”Laue, a 46-year-old businessman from Hamburg, got interested in the search when looking for the grave of his grandfather, which he located near where he died fighting in Russia in 1942 as a young lieutenant. Siepert, 47, an engineer from nearby Frankfurt an der Oder, remembers as a child having regular lectures in school about avoiding the grenades and other munitions still found in the area, and wondering why.Other volunteers include anthropologists, archaeologists, excavators and the disposal experts needed when munitions are found. They hail from all over, including Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands.“We couldn’t, and also don’t, want to look for soldiers from a specific nation,” Laue said. “That’s the interesting thing when one finds one of the dead; one never even knows at the beginning if it’s a German or a Soviet.”In February 1945, they were bitter foes.The village of Klessin sits on a height 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from the Oder River. German military observers used it to call in artillery strikes on Soviet troops as they streamed across a pontoon bridge in the build-up before the final push on Berlin.Recognizing the strategic importance of the hamlet, 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Berlin, the Soviets made it a target. The Nazis resolved to hold it, moving in a unit of soldiers, augmented by officer cadets and older “Volkssturm” militia, scraped up as the number of military-aged men dwindled.The fighting pitted 400 Germans in Klessin against about four times that number of Soviets, with the Germans supported by a unit of Panther tanks in the neighboring village of Podelzig, nearby artillery and air-dropped supplies.Fierce combat raged for nearly two months, often hand-to-hand, as the Soviets attempted to take the village, firing off 62,000 mortar rounds and artillery shells.Exactly how many were killed or listed as missing is not known, but the casualties were enormous, Siepert said.“On March 20, German troops tried to break through there to make a corridor,” he said, pointing to a field between Klessin and Podelzig where the Soviets had laid a minefield and other defenses after encircling the village. “There were 150 missing from that single attack, as well as 50 killed. Seventy made it through.”On March 23, 1945, the beleaguered German soldiers attempted a breakout under the cover of darkness. About 60 made it, and the others were captured or killed.German tank commander Lt. Hans Eimer was listed as missing after the breakout attempt. Eimer had led his Panther tank into Klessin the week before on his 22nd birthday to support the garrison, but the vehicle ended up being knocked out and he was wounded and trapped in the village.Eimer’s younger brother, Fritz, had died in fighting that January. After the war, his sister Margarete had long urged Laue’s group to try and determine the fate of her only other sibling.Eimer’s remains were located by Laue’s group in 2016 by chance and identified by dogtags. The group told Margarete before she died in 2018 that her brother had made it 250 meters (yards) out of the village before he was killed, and lay with two other soldiers.Identifications are rare, especially of the Soviet soldiers who had no dogtags, but occasionally the volunteers get lucky.In a dig on a Soviet outpost on a hill outside of Klessin in 2018, they came across three Soviet soldiers who were all highly decorated and traced their names through the medals.This year’s spring dig has been postponed due to lockdown restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic. Some work is still underway on a memorial site being established amid the rubble of the original farm buildings.Hermann Kaiser, a member of the small community association behind the memorial, said he remembered finding military material as a kid growing up in the area, happily throwing on an old steel helmet and fighting “war” with his friends, while not understanding they were playing on graves.The hope is with the memorial to make sure that others do understand.“We want to present what happened here 75 years ago, what war means, show the younger generation that war destroys everything,” he said, looking at the cratered landscape and rubble of the memorial. “And if we can do that in the place where it happened, it’s unforgettable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/75-years-after-wwii-search-continues-for-missing-soldiers/story-B6qq9AjbvvoCMG9kIAPbbM.html

Kim, who was rumored earlier this month to have fallen ill, didn’t attend the ceremony.Photos of the meeting in Pyongyang showed Russian and North Korean officials wearing face masks despite the fact that North Korea so far has not reported a single case of the new coronavirus.Last year Russia invited Kim to visit Moscow on May 9 and attend the military parade marking the 75th anniversary of the victory. Putin announced the decision to postpone the parade indefinitely last month because of the coronavirus pandemic.In 2015, the North Korean leader rejected a similar invitation to the 70th anniversary, citing domestic affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vladimir-putin-awards-commemorative-wwii-medal-to-kim-jong-un/story-tWp0To5RgGHn3QDFpuCACO.html
05-05-2020||World||US will witness 3,000 coronavirus deaths daily by June 1: Report||The number of coronavirus deaths in the US will jump to over 3,000 and new cases to about 200,000 per day by June 1, an internal draft report has said, even as more than two dozen American states announced to open up their economy amid the health crisis.The US is the worst-hit country from the pandemic. By Monday, more than 1.2 million Americans tested positive for the Covid-19 and the total number of fatalities increased to more than 69,000.The country’s economy has come to a standstill and over 30 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits.Multiple media reports on Monday quoted the draft report projecting the horrifying figures of about 200,000 confirmed cases per day accompanied with 3,000 daily deaths by June 1.“The numbers underscore a sobering reality: while the United States has been hunkered down for the past seven weeks, not much has changed. And the reopening to the economy will make matters worse,” The New York Times reported.“There remains a large number of counties whose burden continues to grow,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned according to the daily.However, both the White House and the CDC disavowed the report. The slides carry the CDC’s logo, The Washington Post reported.According to the report, the projection was prepared by Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.“I had no role in the process by which that was presented and shown. This data was presented as an FYI to CDC … it was not in any way intended to be a forecast,” Lessler told The Washington Post.Lessler said he didn’t know how the update was turned into a slide deck by government officials and shared with the news organisations.“There are reopening scenarios where it could get out of control very quickly,” he said.Judd Deere, a White House Spokesperson said, “This is not a White House document nor has it been presented to the Coronavirus Task Force or gone through interagency vetting.” This data is not reflective of any of the modelling done by the task force or data that the task force has analyzed, he said.“The President’s phased guidelines to open up America again are a scientific driven approach that the top health and infectious disease experts in the federal government agreed with. The health of the American people remains President Trump’s top priority and that will continue as we monitor the efforts by states to ease restrictions,” Deere said.Meanwhile, more than a dozen US states eased COVID-19 restrictions and another over a dozen have announced their plans to do so in the coming days.States like Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas and Illinois, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina, Vermont, and West Virginia have lifted restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-000-coronavirus-deaths-daily-by-june-1-in-us-report/story-6hCSqve3fAvZVv1aurKJvJ.html
05-05-2020||World||Coronavirus deaths top 250,000 as billions pledged for vaccine push||The global death toll from the coronavirus pandemic topped a quarter of a million on Tuesday, with the US government predicting a further surge in fatalities as an international vaccine drive garnered $8 billion in pledges.The dire forecast from the United States came as much of the Western world emerged from weeks of lockdown, with hopes that the disease may have peaked in Europe after nearly two months of confinement.But the global progress did little to cool a war of words between the US and China -- fueled by American claims the virus originated in a Chinese laboratory, a theory the World Health Organization (WHO) labelled “speculative.”An AFP tally of official figures showed Europe is the hardest-hit continent with around 145,000 fatalities. The US has recorded close to 68,700. Together they account for more than 85 percent of global deaths. Since the disease first surfaced in China late last year the number of confirmed cases has reached almost 3.6 million.The grim figures were compounded Monday by an internal government estimate in Washington that forecast the daily COVID-19 infection rate in the US could surge eight-fold to 200,000 per day by June 1, and the death toll could rise to 3,000.‘Evolved in nature’ A special telethon backed by the WHO but snubbed by Washington pulled in $8.1 billion to support international efforts to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus.Leaders of major European powers, Japan, and Canada made the biggest pledges, along with philanthropists including Bill and Melinda Gates.“This was a powerful and inspiring demonstration of global solidarity,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.Seeming to defend its non-participation, the US State Department insisted the United States is “leading” the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and said it has spent more than $1 billion together with US drug companies to work on a vaccine. As the country struggles to contain its outbreak, the White House has stepped up an offensive against China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying there is “enormous evidence” the virus emerged in a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan.That claim was rejected Monday by the WHO as well as top US epidemiologist and government adviser Anthony Fauci.“Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that (this virus) evolved in nature and then jumped species,” he said.US President Donald Trump has acknowledged that deaths will go beyond his earlier prediction of 60,000, saying: “We’re going to lose anywhere from 75, 80 to 100,000 people.”His estimate underscored the tough, politically-tinged debate over reopening, which pits concerns about a rising death toll against the need to restore national economies shattered by prolonged shutdowns.On Monday US manufacturing giant General Electric announced it will cut an additional 10,000 jobs from its aviation sector as the pandemic decimates the industry.The economic fallout in America prompted the US Treasury to announce it will borrow a record $3 trillion in the April-June period, largely to finance spending on virus relief programmes.In Australia officials said the economy is losing Aus$4 billion (US$2.5 billion) every week the nation’s virus shutdown continues, with GDP forecast to plunge 10 percent in the June quarter.‘We are all afraid’ People across Europe basked in a return to the outdoors, mixed with a dose of trepidation about life ahead and the economic damage wreaked by lockdowns.Workers banged away at construction sites in Rome, police handed out masks in Madrid and older children returned to school in Vienna.“We are all afraid,” said a masked Cristina Jimenez, 31, in Madrid.“Who hasn’t lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,” she added.“But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.”Spain and Portugal made face masks mandatory on public transport as they further eased their lockdowns, while Slovenia, Poland and Hungary allowed public spaces and businesses to partially reopen.Africa’s biggest city, Lagos, got back to work at the end of a five-week virus shutdown, while in India police waded in to separate people jostling to buy alcohol for the first time in 40 days as the world’s biggest lockdown eased.New Delhi said it had also embarked on a “massive” operation involving naval ships and aircraft to bring back some of the hundreds of thousands of Indian nationals stuck in the Maldives and United Arab Emirates due to coronavirus restrictions.Hong Kong meanwhile announced plans to ease major social distancing measures, including by reopening schools, cinemas, bars and beauty parlours after the Chinese territory largely halted local transmission of the virus.And in a ray of hope for the sports world, South Korea’s baseball players returned to action Tuesday in a new season, albeit to empty stadiums.Friday will also see the delayed start of the country’s football K-League, and next week some of golf’s leading women players will tee up in a domestic tournament as South Korea becomes a rare hotspot for live sport. ‘There’s still beauty’ Culture of a different kind was providing a balm for people in Washington, where French harmonica player Frédéric Yonnet is putting on regular two-hour concerts for free for people gathering outside his home in the US capital.Wanda Evans, basking in the music from her car, said: “There’s still art, there’s still talent, there’s still beauty to be shared in this world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-deaths-top-250-000-as-billions-pledged-for-vaccine-push/story-Fazjh7xjiVfYbnLfKSYrHN.html
05-05-2020||World||Masked and standing apart, the world tiptoes out of Covid-19 lockdown||Italy and the United States were among a slew of countries tentatively easing coronavirus lockdowns on Monday to revive economies as global deaths surpassed a quarter of a million.World leaders and organisations pledged $8 billion to fund a possible vaccine and treatments, many hoping explicitly to ensure that no country on Earth would be left out, but the United States did not contribute.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageItaly, among the world’s hardest-hit countries, allowed about 4.5 million people to return to work after nearly two months at home. Construction work can resume and relatives can reunite.“I woke up at 5:30 a.m., I was so excited,” said Maria Antonietta Galluzzo, a grandmother taking her three-year-old grandson for a walk in Rome’s Villa Borghese park, the first time they had seen each other in eight weeks.In the United States, which has the world’s highest total of infections and deaths, at almost 1.2 million and 68,000 respectively, Ohio and other states were easing more curbs on businesses. An internal US government document projected a sharp rise in daily deaths by June 1, the New York Times reported on Monday, to 3,000 Americans a day by the end of May, up from a current daily toll that a Reuters tally places at around 2,000. On the same day, a University of Washington research model often cited by White House officials nearly doubled its projected US death toll to over 134,000 by Aug. 4.Asked about the Times report, White House spokesman Judd Deere said: “This is not a White House document nor has it been presented to the Coronavirus Task Force or gone through interagency vetting.”In New York, the hardest-hit US state, Governor Andrew Cuomo outlined a phased reopening of business, starting with industries such as construction, and the least affected regions.Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Finland, Nigeria, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Israel and Lebanon were also among countries variously reopening factories, construction sites, parks, hairdressers and libraries. The daily increase in coronavirus cases worldwide has been 2%-3% over the past week, down from around 13% in mid-March.Confirmed cases - certain to exclude many mild cases - have risen to around 3.58 million, according to a Reuters tally.Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said his country, where the novel coronavirus has killed over 29,000 people and over a thousand new cases are reported daily, was still in the “full throes of the pandemic.”A CHANGED WORLDItaly’s statistics bureau said it could be assumed that a further 11,600 deaths were people who had died of Covid-19 without being tested, or of other causes that a stressed health service had been unable to treat them for.Friends are still barred from meeting up, most shops must stay shut until May 18, and schools, cinemas and theatres remain closed indefinitely.“It is good to be back, but the world has totally changed,” said Gianluca Martucci, pulling up the shutters on the small warehouse of a catering business in the backstreets of Rome. “I worry that we might be starting up a little too soon ... I don’t know if the country could survive a second wave.”Hairdressers, ironmongers and other shops tentatively opened as Spain, too, began a phased reopening. Red Cross workers handed out masks at Madrid metro stations, now mandatory on public transport.And Spain’s widely watched top tier of soccer, La Liga, said clubs were starting to train in the hope of resuming the season in June.Similar phased steps were taken in other countries, from Portugal and Belgium to India and Israel.But Japan extended a state of emergency to at least May 31.And the EU agency for disease control said Britain, yet to ease its lockdown, was one of five European countries yet to reach the peak of its outbreak, contradicting the UK government’s line.People around the world are adjusting to a new normality.In Washington, the US Supreme Court smoothly conducted arguments by teleconference for the first time and broadcast them live online.In Rome, a hum of cars, buses and motorbikes pointed to an increase in morning commuting, but traffic was relatively light and people appeared to be keeping their distance.In Beirut, restaurants began to reopen but were removing chairs and tables to remain less than 30% full.Iran, which has reported more than 6,000 deaths, was due to reopen mosques in 132 cities. ‘UNPRECEDENTED COOPERATION’After a fractious and haphazard initial global response to the pandemic, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the $8.1 billion initially raised by the U.N.-backed donor conference would “help kick-start unprecedented global cooperation.”Access to an eventual vaccine “will be given to people across the globe by the organisation we choose,” French President Emmanuel Macron said.A senior US administration official declined to say specifically why the United States was not participating.“We support this pledging effort by the EU. It is one of many pledging efforts that are going on and the United States is at the forefront,” the official told reporters by telephone.President Donald Trump is halting US funding to the World Health Organization over its handling of the pandemic.“It is a pity the US is not a part of it,” said Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, pledging $1 billion. “When you are in a crisis, you manage it and you do it jointly with others.”Factory activity slumped across the world in April and the outlook is bleak as shutdowns have frozen production and hammered demand. The global economy is expected to suffer its steepest contraction on record.Escalating tensions between the United States and China over the origin of the pandemic drove down stock markets and oil prices as investors feared a new trade war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/masked-and-standing-apart-the-world-tiptoes-out-of-covid-19-lockdown/story-PBeMXZ3yUuLK0ObXS3NRhO.html
05-05-2020||World||Covid-19 fatality in these 2 small nations below 0.1% as deaths grow worldwide||As the global death toll from the coronavirus pandemic exceeds 250,000, two tiny nations stand out with the lowest fatality rates among countries who are experiencing major outbreaks.In Qatar and Singapore, the death toll is less than 0.1% of reported infections. In Singapore, where total cases have surged to one of the highest in Asia as it grapples with outbreaks in foreign-worker dormitories, a 102-year-old woman recovered from the virus and was discharged from hospital over the weekend.Patient demographics and the ability of the health-care system to cope are key to keeping the survival rate high in this pandemic, health experts say. While some countries with small outbreaks like Vietnam have not suffered a single death, those dealing with major spread -- defined as more than 10,000 cases -- often start to see their health-care infrastructure come under pressure.Among economies with major outbreaks, Qatar’s case fatality ratio is the lowest at 0.07% -- 12 deaths out of more than 16,000 cases. Singapore’s ratio is 0.093% of more than 19,000 infections. Both countries have also kept mortality from the virus low as a proportion of their populations: less than 0.5 per 100,000 people.The two nations are also among some of the wealthiest in the world, which means they can better afford the test kits and hospital beds they need. Just behind Qatar and Singapore in survival rates are Belarus, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.These rates are calculated from official numbers self-reported by nations. Belarus has come under criticism for allegedly under-reporting its data.Low case fatality ratios boil down to three things: testing, age of the population and intensive care unit capacity, said Raina MacIntyre, professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales.“Countries that test more and detect more mild cases will have an apparently lower case fatality rate,” she said. Older populations and countries that exceed their intensive care unit and ventilator capacity will also have higher death rates, she said.While Singapore has an aging population and a higher median age than Qatar, the majority of its infections are among low-wage foreign workers, who are typically young and undergo health checks before they are allowed into the country to work.Similarly, many of the cases in the Middle East are within the younger, migrant workforce. The majority of the population in U.A.E. and Qatar are younger expatriates, who also go through health checks before entering the country, and are required to leave once their employment is over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-fatality-in-these-2-small-nations-below-0-1-as-deaths-grow-worldwide/story-e9JPUxPmb9eJ1nchhcZElM.html

Its forecast is double its previous projection of 72,433 over the same period.The spike in the internal assessment was ascribed to “large number of counties whose burden continues to grow”, according the New York Times.But the IHME forecast was clear. “The revised projections reflect rising mobility in most US states as well as the easing of social distancing measures expected in 31 states by May 11, indicating that growing contacts among people will promote transmission of the coronavirus,” it said in a statement.President Trump has aggressively pushed for reopening the country and a return to normalcy with an eye on his re-election, even as he has had to temper his display of optimism by continuously revising upwards his own assessment of fatalities — he is now saying it can hit 100,000.At 68,920 on Monday, the toll was way past the American president’s earlier forecast of 60,000, and is poised to overtake not only his subsequent projections but also IHME’s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huge-spike-projected-in-us-covid-19-cases-fatalities/story-fXNm46K6kr2iwWHoSRyLdJ.html

Also Read: North and South Korea exchange gunfire across border at guard post“We think those are accidental. South Koreans did return fire. So far as we can tell, there was no loss of life on either side,” Pompeo said on ABC This Week.Pompeo declined to discuss whether he knows whether Kim has been gravely ill over the last few weeks - which ratcheted up speculation as Kim missed a celebration of his late grandfather - but said based on video footage of him from state television at a recent event, “It looks like Chairman Kim is alive and well.”“We know there have been other extended periods of timewhere Chairman Kim’s been out of public view as well, so it’s not unprecedented,” Pompeo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shots-fired-by-north-korea-accidental-us-secretary-of-state-pompeo/story-vkbRG9GuencES4EWPsYLiP.html

She was acquitted last year.“USCIRF is aware of nearly 80 individuals who remained imprisoned for blasphemy, with at least half facing a life sentence or death,” it further said in the report.Highlighting the plight of Ahmadiya Muslims, the panel said in its reports, “Ahmadi Muslims, with their faith essentially criminalised, continued to face severe persecution from authorities as well as societal harassment due to their beliefs, with both the authorities and mobs targeting their houses of worship.”It also said that 1,000 women are forcibly converted to Islam each year in Pakistan. “Many are kidnapped, forcibly married, and subjected to rape.”The commission monitors religious freedoms around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-panel-want-pakistan-to-be-re-designated-for-religious-freedom-violations/story-Y8Wd4tyEsSKRj0r1QaZGNO.html

Restrictions lifted on other commercial activity in several provinces as well.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the country was on a “positive trajectory” as the easing of restrictions commenced. That view was echoed by Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Therera Tam, as she said, “In some places, the epidemic has been brought under good control and the time is right for a cautious reopening.” The country counted 60,650 cases of coronavirus infection by Monday evening, including 3,842 deaths.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe easing is taking place in retail stores in many places, with a couple of provinces even seeing some restaurants back to serving customers.However, in the province of Quebec, which accounts for over half the recorded cases in Canada, permission to reopen such establishments has been delayed by an additional week in the city of Montreal and its vicinity, as the area has been hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.Click here for Covid-19 updatesMeanwhile, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business welcomed the “careful, phased approach to the reopening of the economy.” In a statement, it said it was “good news that some businesses in some provinces will be permitted to serve customers once again.”The closure of businesses across the country has played havoc with the economy and has led to record unemployment. Given these circumstances, Trudeau said, during his daily media briefing, that there was no timeline for presenting the Federal Budget, which was scheduled for March.“A budget in normal times is a forecast of the measures that will be presented in the year to come. Right now we are in a period of uncertainty, extraordinary uncertainty, as to what might happen next month or in three months,” he said. This was to be the first Budget to be presented since he formed a minority Government following Federal elections in October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-a-positive-trajectory-says-pm-trudeau-as-canada-eases-covid-19-lockdown-restrictions/story-1aBEhkUtWFSIAzRt52MROM.html

Malls, movie theaters and other venues are reopening in several states. Some states have outlined phased reopenings: North Carolina’s governor said he hopes to start such a process after this week if virus trends allow.Some states, including epicenter New York, are moving more slowly, with restrictions in place at least until May 15. In California, some counties have announced their reopening in defiance of an ongoing stay-home order.And some states never issued stay-home orders at all.At least 100 million Americans were in states making assertive moves to reopen, or had no stay-home orders to begin with, according to an Associated Press tally. States home to more than 210 million were taking more gradual steps or didn’t appear close to reopening.Here’s a look at where states stand on reopening.NEW MOVES:TEXAS: The stay-home order expired Friday, and restaurants, malls and movie theaters can reopen at 25 percent capacity with social distancing. Counties with five or fewer reported coronavirus cases have looser occupancy rules. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has said restrictions may be relaxed further in two weeks depending on testing results. Beaches and state parks are open. Bars, gyms and hair salons remain closed.SOUTH CAROLINA: The stay-home order lifted Monday as South Carolina let outdoor restaurant dining resume. Parks, beaches, malls, hotels and clothing stores have reopened. Republican Gov. Henry McMaster said up next are hair salons, gyms and other close-contact businesses.FLORIDA: Restaurants and shops could reopen at limited capacity Monday across Florida, except for three hard-hit counties. State parks reopened with social distancing rules. Gyms and salons remain closed. Schools will stay closed for the rest of this school year.TENNESSEE: After allowing many restaurants and retail stores to reopen last week, salons and other close-contact stores will be allowed to resume Wednesday. The state has released guidelines on safely reopening, but officials acknowledge Tennessee won’t enforce such measures.OKLAHOMA: Restaurant dining rooms, bars serving food, gyms and churches began welcoming back customers last week under social distancing and sanitation guidelines, following the earlier reopening of barbers and hair and nail salons. Employees, including church staff, are required to wear masks. Church day cares aren’t allowed to open.MONTANA: Restaurants, bars and casinos began reopening Monday with increased sanitizing, limited crowds and servers donning masks. Churches and retailers opened last week, and a stay-home order was lifted except for vulnerable populations including older adults. Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock is allowing schools to reopen Thursday, but many districts already canceled in-person classes for the year.UTAH: Restaurants, gyms, barbers and nail salons began reopening Friday. Distancing and mask requirements were in place for employees and some customers in urban Salt Lake County. Schools are closed for the academic year. Republican Gov. Gary Herbert said churches will likely be among the last places to reopen.COLORADO: Offices deemed nonessential were allowed to reopen Monday with reduced staff. The move follows the April 26 expiration of Democratic Gov. Jared Polis’ stay-home order. Current restrictions allow curbside retail and real estate showings. On May 1, retail stores and personal services were allowed to reopen with social distancing rules.OHIO: Since Friday, most health care offices could reopen and retailers could begin offering delivery and pickup services, along with by-appointment visits for 10 or fewer customers. Distributors, manufacturers and builders restarted Monday with mask and social distancing requirements. Gyms, bars, restaurants, barbershops, salons, and movie theaters remain closed under Republican Gov. Mike Dewine’s order.ARKANSAS: Gyms reopened Monday with social distancing and other restrictions. Barbershops, tattoo parlors and hair salons can reopen Wednesday, but with similar restrictions on capacity and additional screening requirements. Restaurants can reopen dining rooms next Monday, but only at a third of their capacity.MISSOURI: Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s stay-home order ended Sunday, allowing businesses and religious events to reopen Monday. Some businesses, such as restaurants, must follow social distancing guidelines. Locally imposed stay-home orders remain in the St. Louis area through mid-May.WEST VIRGINIA: Republican Gov. Jim Justice on Monday allowed the reopening of small businesses, barber shops, nail salons, and church and funeral services. Restaurants can allow outdoor dining. The move includes restrictions and is contingent on the state’s positive virus test rate staying below a threshold. In subsequent weeks, offices, hotels, casinos, restaurants and other remaining businesses could reopen.ALASKA: Starting April 24, officials in Alaska allowed dine-in service at restaurants and reopening of retailers, personal care services and other businesses, with limitations. For example, the plans call for use of face coverings, limits on capacity and sanitizing requirements. The state in April decided there would be no in-person classes for K-12 students for the rest of the academic year.VERMONT: More Vermont construction and manufacturing workers returned to work Monday after Republican Gov. Phil Scott loosened some restrictions. Scott also announced Monday that some elective health care procedures may resume. Last week, outdoor retail space that had been previously restricted to curbside or delivery service was allowed to open to in-person shopping with a maximum of 10 people, including both customers and employees.LOUISIANA: Gov. John Bel Edwards has allowed non-emergency medical procedures to resume, and he’s allowed restaurants to open outside seating. Mall stores also have been given the green light to restart business, but with curbside service only. Other nonessential retailers that have never been forced to close -- such as jewelry stores and boutiques -- cannot have more than 10 people in the store at a time. Businesses that remain closed include casinos, salons, tattoo parlors, movie theaters, gyms and entertainment venues, and the overall stay-at-home order remains in place through May 15.MORE GRADUAL:WASHINGTON STATE: Gov. Jay Inslee has already eased some restrictions, including allowing day use of state parks. Outdoor recreation such as fishing and golfing will be allowed starting Tuesday. The Democratic governor also announced the state’s stay-at-home order will be extended through at least May 31. That will be followed with a four-stage process of lifting restrictions, starting with allowing retail curbside pickup, automobile sales and car washes by mid-May.OREGON: Gov. Kate Brown says some rural counties where there are almost no cases can begin reopening slowly starting May 15 if certain conditions have been met.

He said the firings were “evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture.”Amazon, which is based in Seattle, declined to comment.Among those fired was a New York warehouse worker who led a strike last month, pushing Amazon for more protections for workers against the new coronavirus. At the time, Amazon said the worker was fired for not obeying social-distancing rules.Bray, who said he worked at Amazon’s cloud business for more that five years, said he brought up the firings internally at the company.“That done, remaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised,” he wrote. “So I resigned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-executive-says-he-quit-to-protest-employee-firings/story-DTmO72hNMXBiSqQtwM9oOJ.html
05-05-2020||World||Covid-19 pushing Trump administration to rip global supply chains from China: Officials||The Trump administration is “turbocharging” an initiative to remove global industrial supply chains from China as it weighs new tariffs to punish Beijing for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, according to officials familiar with U.S. planning.President Donald Trump, who has stepped up recent attacks on China ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, has long pledged to bring manufacturing back from overseas.Now, economic destruction and the U.S. coronavirus death toll are driving a government-wide push to move U.S. production and supply chain dependency away from China, even if it goes to other more friendly nations instead, current and former senior U.S. administration officials said. “We’ve been working on (reducing the reliance of our supply chains in China) over the last few years but we are now turbo-charging that initiative,” Keith Krach, undersecretary for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment at the State Department told Reuters. “I think it is essential to understand where the critical areas are and where critical bottlenecks exist,” Krach said, adding that the matter was key to U.S. security and one the government could announce new action on soon. The U.S. Commerce Department, State and other agencies are looking for ways to push companies to move both sourcing and manufacturing out of China. Tax incentives and potential re-shoring subsidies are among measures being considered to spur changes, the current and former officials told Reuters. “There is a whole of government push on this,” said one. Agencies are probing which manufacturing should be deemed “essential” and how to produce these goods outside of China.Trump’s China policy has been defined by behind-the-scenes tussles between pro-trade advisers and China hawks; now the latter say their time has come. “This moment is a perfect storm; the pandemic has crystallized all the worries that people have had about doing business with China,” said another senior U.S. official.“All the money that people think they made by making deals with China before, now they’ve been eclipsed many fold by the economic damage from the coronavirus”, the official said.Economic prosperity network Trump has said repeatedly that he could put new tariffs on top of the up to 25% tax on $370 billion in Chinese goods currently in place. U.S. companies, which pay the tariffs, are already groaning under the existing ones, especially as sales plummet during coronavirus lockdowns.But that does not mean Trump will balk at new ones, officials say. Other ways to punish China may include sanctions on officials or companies, and closer relations with Taiwan, the self-governing island China considers a province. Commerce on Monday launched a national security probe that could lead to new U.S. tariffs on imports of key components of power transformers, saying it needed assured domestic access to such goods to be able to respond to power disruptions.Discussions about moving supply chains are concrete, robust, and, unusually for the Trump administration, multi-lateral. The United States is pushing to create an alliance of “trusted partners” dubbed the “Economic Prosperity Network,” one official said. It would include companies and civil society groups operating under the same set of standards on everything from digital business, energy and infrastructure to research, trade, education and commerce, he said. The U.S. government is working with Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Vietnam to “move the global economy forward,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said April 29. These discussions include “how we restructure ... supply chains to prevent something like this from ever happening again,” Pompeo said.Latin America may play a role, too. Colombian Ambassador Francisco Santos last month said he was in discussions with the White House, National Security Council, Treasury Department and U.S. Chamber of Commerce about a drive to encourage U.S. companies to move some supply chains out of China and bring them closer to home. China overtook the United States as the world’s top manufacturing country in 2010, and was responsible for 28% of global output in 2018, according to United Nations data. The pandemic has highlighted China’s key role in the supply chain for generic drugs that account for the majority of prescriptions in the United States. It has also shown China’s dominance in goods like the thermal cameras needed to test workers for fevers, and its importance in food supplies. Hard sell for companies Many U.S. companies have invested heavily in Chinese manufacturing and rely on China’s 1.4 billion people for a big chunk of their sales. “Diversification and some redundancy in supply chains will make sense given the level of risk that the pandemic has uncovered,” said Doug Barry, spokesman for the U.S.-China Business Council. “But we don’t see a wholesale rush for the exits by companies doing business in China.”White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Monday said Trump had already signed an order that could allow limits on imports of components for the U.S. power grid from Russia and China, and would soon issue a separate order that would require federal agencies to purchase U.S.-made medical products.John Murphy, senior vice president for international policy at the Chamber of Commerce, said that U.S. manufacturers already meet 70% of current pharmaceutical demand.Building new facilities in the United States could take five to eight years, he said. “We’re concerned that officials need to get the right fact sets before they start looking at alternatives,” Murphy said. Trump White House pledges to punish China have not always been followed by action.A move to block global exports of chips to blacklisted Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, for example, favored by hawks in the administration and under consideration since November, has not yet been finalized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pushing-trump-administration-to-rip-global-supply-chains-from-china-officials/story-69swY606PA6RWoRdQumEIJ.html

He also emphasized that nations needed to ensure equitable distribution of the vaccine, once a suitable one is developed.ALSO READ | Ahead of WHO’s virtual meet, some real pressure on Tedros. And a complicationPolitical leaders of all major European countries on Monday called for cooperation and not competition in the quest for a vaccine for the coronavirus, as they pledged 7.4 billion euros at a fundraising teleconference that had been turned down by the United States.Major European nations, along with Japan and Canada, made some of the biggest contributions. The fund raising teleconference was, however, marred by the absence of any representation from the United States. President Donald Trump has been openly critical of the global health watchdog’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.In total around 40 countries, along with the United Nations and several philanthropic agencies that included the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and research institutes made donations for the coronavirus vaccine.President Trump who will contest for re-election later this year had said only a day earlier on Sunday, that the United States would have a coronavirus vaccine ready by the end of the year. Scientists and health experts across the globe, however, have warned against such optimism saying that it may take a few years for countries to develop an effective vaccine which would help tackle the contagious Covid-19 disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/billions-raised-for-covid-19-vaccine-display-powerful-show-of-global-solidarity-who-chief/story-zPE0JFhQ7uDRZCq2TDbu1L.html
