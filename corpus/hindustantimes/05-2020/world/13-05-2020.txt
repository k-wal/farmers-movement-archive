And at least one of the four major processors says it has reduced exports during the pandemic.If companies manage to keep their workers healthy and plants operating, there should be plenty of supply to satisfy domestic and foreign markets, according to industry officials.“I really feel like the industry is well positioned to serve all of its customers both here and abroad,” said Joe Schuele, a spokesman for the industry trade group U.S. Meat Export Federation.Meat exports, particularly pork exports to China, grew significantly throughout the first three months of the year. This was partly due to several new trade agreements that were completed before the coronavirus outbreak led to the temporary closure of dozens of U.S. meatpacking plants in April and May and to increased absenteeism at many plants that reduced their output.The Meat Export Federation said pork exports jumped 40% and beef exports grew 9% during the first three months of the year. Chicken exports, meanwhile, grew by 8% in the first quarter. Complete figures weren’t yet available for April, but Agriculture Department figures for the last week of April show that pork exports jumped by 40% as shipments to China and Japan surged and exports to Mexico and Canada remained strong. Beef exports declined by 22% in that last week of April.China’s demand for imported pork has risen over the past year because its own pig herds were decimated by an outbreak of African swine fever, and China pledged to buy $40 billion in U.S. agricultural products per year under a trade pact signed in January. China also became the fourth-largest market for American poultry in the first quarter after it lifted a five-year ban on those products. A trade agreement with Japan and a new North American free trade agreement also helped boost exports.Part of the reason why exports have continued to be so strong this spring is that much of the meat headed overseas was bought up to six months ahead of time — before the virus outbreak took hold in the U.S.“A lot of these sales were made before COVID-19 hit. China had already made these purchases and then COVID-19 hit. They had actually pre-purchased a lot of this before the plant problems hit,” said Chad Hart, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University.It’s also worth noting that meat exports to China and other Asian markets include cuts such as pig feet, snouts and internal organs that have little value in the United States. The most popular cuts in the U.S., including bacon and pork chops, largely stay in the domestic market. More than half of the chicken exports to China were chicken feet. And the Meat Export Federation says demand from the export market helps boost meat production in the U.S. because more animals are slaughtered to help meet all the demand.Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said he doesn’t think it makes sense to restrict exports because so much of the meat sold internationally isn’t popular in the U.S.“I think it’s important to prioritize,” said Naig, whose state leads the nation in pork production. “I think companies should meet the domestic market first and then be free to sell the things that the American consumer doesn’t purchase and the types of things that we don’t normally consume. That’s economically important.”Meat production in the United States is dominated by a few huge companies — JBS, Smithfield, Tyson Foods and Cargill. Cameron Bruett, a spokesman for JBS, said that Brazilian-owned company has reduced exports to help ensure it can satisfy U.S. demand for its products. Tyson Foods and Cargill didn’t respond to questions about their exports.Smithfield Foods, which is owned by a Chinese company, said in a statement that it isn’t controlled by any government and that the free market determines what products it exports. JBS declined to respond to questions about its foreign ownership. Purdue University agricultural economist Jayson Lusk said it’s not clear what role the foreign owners play in deciding how much meat is exported.The industry has been dealing with a number of production challenges caused by the coronavirus, and several large plants had to close temporarily because of outbreaks of COVID-19, the disease it causes. At least 30 U.S. meatpacking workers have died of COVID-19 and another 10,000 have been infected or exposed to the virus, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents roughly 80% of the country’s beef and pork workers and 33% of its poultry workers.Kansas State agricultural economist Glynn Tonsor said he thinks the industry will get past the shortage concerns within the next several weeks.“I think it’s important that we note that the U.S. hog industry is large enough to sufficiently supply our domestic market and export. We’ve done that for some time. We’ve been growing volumes in both places for some time,” Tonsor said.Tyson and Smithfield have both been able to reopen huge pork processing plants that were temporarily closed in Iowa and South Dakota, which should help the industry keep up with demand even if some plants aren’t running at full capacity, said David Herring, of the National Pork Producers Council.“I really don’t think we’ll see a big problem with meat shortages,” said Herring, who raises hogs near Lillington, North Carolina. “As long as the plants are able to come back up and operate maybe not at 100% but at 80% or 90%, I think we should be good.”___Check out more of the AP’s coronavirus coverage at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-meat-exports-surge-as-industry-struggles-to-meet-demand/story-96bm6ShlTrS5Vfj4pHsUKP.html

Emergency assistance program loan to India was approved in quick response to the urgent request and immediate financing needs of the Government of India in fighting Covid-19,” Xian Zhu, vice president and chief operations officer of the bank said.According to the NDB, it envisages, preventing, detecting, and responding to the threat posed by Covid-19, funding critical healthcare expenditure that will enhance healthcare capacity in India and strengthen national health systems preparedness and providing immediate economic assistance to the vulnerable and affected groups, facilitating economic and social recoveryIn March, the NDB had approved an emergency assistance loan of 7 billion yuan (about 1 billion U.S. dollars) to China to help the country fight the outbreak.It was not only the first loan under NDB’s emergency assistance programme but also the largest single loan issued by the bank so far.The loan to China provided financial support for unplanned emergency public health expenditures related to the anti-epidemic fight, official news agency, Xinhua reported, adding that the assistance focussed on three Chinese provinces worst hit by the outbreak -- Hubei, Guangdong and Henan.The NDB was established by the BRICS countries in 2014 and is headed by Indian banker KV Kamath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-china-brics-bank-loans-1billion-to-india-to-fight-covid-19-pandemic/story-pqQYj7CrFiHBo1FNibPwUM.html

It is 10,000 more than the previous estimate.The new estimates from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) of the University of Washington came just hours after the Trump administration’s top public health officials had warned lawmakers at a US senate hearing of “little spikes that might turn into outbreaks” because of premature reopening.The IHME bluntly attributed the “higher” projection to “changes in testing and mobility, as well as easing of distancing policies”.Public health officials and experts are urging caution as many states have allowed some businesses to reopen and lifted restrictions on public life and others re under increasing pressure to follow, egged on by President Donald Trump who is eager to change the narrative and move on. “We have met the moment and we have prevailed,” he told reporters Monday.But his own public health experts and officials have a distinctly different assessment of the battle against the epidemic, which had 82,389 people till Wednesday morning (up by 1,674 over the past 24 hours) and infected more than 1.37 million people.“It depends on what you mean by containment,” Anthony Fauci, the top US epidemiologist and member of the White House task force on the coronavirus, said at the senate hearing when asked if the outbreak had been contained. “If you think we have it completely under control, we don’. But he added the US is “going in the right direction”.“We are not out of the woods yet,” Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and also a member of the task force, told senators.Both Fauci and Redfield were among the four public health officials who testified, all remotely, along with Stephen Kahn, head of the Drug and Food Administration, and Admiral Brett P. Giroir, an assistant secretary of health.In a separate but related development, some Republican senators moved a legislation that seek to authorize the president to impose sanctions against China for not giving a full accounting of the coronavirus outbreak. “The Chinese Communist Party must be held accountable for the detrimental role they played in this pandemic,” said Senator Jim Inhofe, one of the sponsors of the “COVID-19 Accountability Act.”, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-easing-could-push-up-covid-19-fatalities-by-10k-warn-us-researchers/story-ho39CUxChRSBgq2JzDQV3I.html

Starmer’s perceived ‘pro-India’ remarks drew sharp criticism inside and outside the party.Starmer wrote to the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), which sought a clarification from him: “Our position on Kashmir has not changed, we support and recognise previous UN resolutions on the rights of the Kashmiri people but maintain that if we are to find a lasting settlement, to end this conflict, that can only be achieved if India and Pakistan working together, with the people of Kashmir”.His remarks to LFIN and the MCB come in the context of violence and more in London after New Delhi made fundamental changes in the status of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019. A resolution at the party’s conference in September calling for outside intervention was angrily rejected by the ministry of external affairs in New Delhi.A lawyer with a background in human rights litigation, Starmer added in the letter to MCB: “As I outlined in my leadership campaign, my approach to international relations will be to always promote peace and put human rights first.”“I will also ensure that (shadow foreign secretary) Lisa Nandy follows up on this correspondence and reached out to you to discuss how we can ensure the voices of our Kashmiri communities contribute to Labour’s policy making processes”, he added.Indian circles believe Starmer is keen to draw a line from the Corbyn era on Kashmir as part of his bid to regain power at the next elections, but remain cautiously optimistic on his overtures so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-change-in-labour-position-on-kashmir-keir-starmer/story-9AeaEq55qtBpWQNhZs8o0I.html

Every day I try to build a better relationship with Russia and on the other hand there is such hard evidence that Russian forces are doing this,” she told parliament.Germany’s intelligence service has repeatedly called out attempts by Russian hackers to spy on lawmakers or leading politicians.German media reported that among information copied by hackers in 2015 was data from Merkel’s email account. That attack also targeted the Bundestag.Merkel said investigators into the 2015 hacking had identified a specific suspect.“Unfortunately the conclusion I have reached is that this is not new,” she said, noting that “cyber-disorientation, the distortion of facts” were all part of “Russia’s strategy”.“Obviously this doesn’t make it easier” to foster a better relationship with Moscow, she said, calling such spying tactics “more than uncomfortable”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hard-evidence-russian-hackers-targeted-her-german-chancellor-angela-merkel/story-RaoJpJQ14ICwACSTb6uP8H.html

13-05-2020||World||UK GDP shrinks by record 5.8% in March, harder Covid hit ahead||Britain’s economy shrank by a record 5.8% in March as the coronavirus crisis escalated and the government shut down much of the country, according to official data that point towards an even bigger hit to come.The monthly drop in gross domestic product was felt in almost all sectors - from the country’s shuttered restaurants and bars to its building sites and factories - and was the largest since comparable records began in 1997.“The sharp contraction in UK Q1 GDP comes as little surprise, but does clearly highlight the magnitude of the challenge facing policymakers,” JP Morgan market strategist Hugh Gimber said.In the first three months of the year, GDP contracted by 2.0% from the last three months of 2019, the biggest drop since the depths of the financial crisis in late 2008, the Office for National Statistics said.The Bank of England said last week that the contraction of the economy in the April-June period could approach 25% and lead to the largest annual decline in more than three centuries.British two-year government bond yields sank to a record low of -0.045% after the data, reinforcing expectations that the Bank of England will ramp up its record 645 billion pounds ($791 billion) of asset purchases next month.Finance minister Rishi Sunak said Britain was now in the midst of a significant recession. “We have to support people’s jobs, their incomes, livelihoods at this time, and support businesses so we can get through this period of severe disruption and emerge stronger on the other side,” he said after the GDP data. A newspaper said on Tuesday that finance ministry officials have warned Sunak the budget deficit could swell to a record 337 billion pounds this year from just 55 billion pounds forecast in March. On Tuesday, Britain’s government extended a costly job support programme for another four months, though businesses will need to pick up more of the tab from August. DELAYED LOCKDOWNThe decline in first-quarter GDP was slightly smaller than economists had forecast in a Reuters poll, and less than the 3.8% slump suffered by the euro zone in the first quarter. But Britain only started its lockdown on March 23, later than many other euro zone countries.COVID-19 has killed more than 40,000 people in the United Kingdom, the highest death toll reported in Europe so far.Economists said output appeared to have fallen around a fifth after the lockdown came into force.Separate data from the British Retail Consortium trade body showed retail spending dropped almost a fifth in April. Barclaycard said consumer spending had dropped more than a third.Wednesday’s ONS figures showed household consumption fell by 1.8% in the first quarter, the most since 2008.The BoE said last week the economy could rebound if coronavirus restrictions are lifted, pencilling in a 15% recovery after a historic 14% fall in GDP for 2020 as a whole.But it warned recovery might be slower, especially if consumers prove cautious about returning to their normal lives, a view shared by many economists.“The UK’s economic engine will be much harder to kickstart than it was to stall,” Rabobank economist Stefan Koopman said.“Talk of a V-shaped recovery feels like wishful thinking, and we expect prolonged periods of depressed growth across the majority of the economy. A flatter, U-shaped recovery is more likely,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-gdp-shrinks-by-record-5-8-in-march-harder-covid-hit-ahead/story-m7M2jjigVFIzNa13OoHpbM.html
13-05-2020||World||UK researchers try to solve genetic riddle behind Covid-19’s erratic behaviour||British researchers will study the genes of thousands of ill Covid-19 patients to try to crack one of the most puzzling riddles of the novel coronavirus: why does it kill some people but give others not even a mild headache?Researchers from across the United Kingdom will sequence the genetic code of people who fell critically ill with Covid-19 and compare their genomes with those who were mildly ill or not ill at all. The hunt for the specific genes that could cause a predisposition to getting ill with Covid-19 will involve up to 20,000 people currently or previously in hospital intensive care with Covid-19 and about 15,000 people with mild symptoms.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicScientists caution that their knowledge of the novel coronavirus, which emerged in China last year, is still modest though they say it is striking how it can be so deadly for some but so mild for others.It is, as yet, unclear why. “We think that there will be clues in the genome that will help us understand how the disease is killing people,” Kenneth Baillie, an intensive care doctor who is leading the study at the University of Edinburgh, told Reuters.“I would bet my house on there being a very strong genetic component to individual risk,” Baillie said. Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakHealth minister Matt Hancock called on people to sign up to the programme. “If you’re asked to sign up to the genomics trial which is being run by Genomics England, then please do, because then we can understand the genetic links. It’s all part of building a scientific picture of this virus.”The genome is an organism’s complete set of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, and in humans it contains about 3 billion DNA base pairs.But comparing them can be tough. There are 4 million to 5 million differences between any two people so scientists need a big sample, Baillie said. “We don’t know at a mechanistic level, at the level of molecules and cells, what are the events that are actually causing people to get sick and die from this disease,” he said.Baillie will work with the intensive care units across the United Kingdom, Genomics England and a global genetics research consortium known as the Genetics of Susceptibility and Mortality in Critical Care, or GenOMICC.“By reading the whole genome we may able to identify variation that affects response to Covid-19 and discover new therapies that could reduce harm, save lives and even prevent future outbreaks,” said Mark Caulfield, chief scientist at Genomics England. Some answers could come as soon as in a few weeks from a study of almost 2,000 people already underway, Baillie said, though it is likely that testing more people will ensure that the signals they detect are genuine. The results will be shared globally.“Your chance of dying from an infection is very strongly encoded in your genes - much more strongly than your chances of dying from heart disease or cancer,” Baillie said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-researchers-try-to-solve-genetic-riddle-behind-covid-19-s-erratic-behaviour/story-KJ6erZIRHVlx5YHasPtOvO.html
13-05-2020||World||South Korea sticks with coronavirus lockdown rollback despite nightclub outbreak||South Korea health authorities said on Wednesday they had no immediate plans to reinstate strict social distancing rules despite a fresh coronavirus outbreak in the capital of Seoul. Officials have scrambled to trace and test thousands of people over the past week after a cluster of new infections linked to nightclubs and bars in Seoul’s Itaewon district raised fears of a second wave outbreak.Officials have linked at least 119 cases of COVID-19 to the night spots, which had just reopened as part of the country’s move to ease lockdown measures to jumpstart its struggling economy. Eleven of the 119 patients are 19 years old or younger.Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said bringing back the social distancing rules was unlikely as long as the daily number of new cases remained below 50 and officials were able to trace 95% of all infections.“For now, we will still monitor how the current transmissions go and review whether we should reconsider our distancing policy,” Kim told a media briefing.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC)reported 26 new cases as of midnight Tuesday, with 21 tied to the Seoul nightclub outbreak. That was slightly lower than levels reported in the previous two days and brought the national tally to 10,962, including 259 deaths.The Itaewon outbreak prompted officials to re-shutter some nightclubs and bars as well as delay the planned reopening of schools by a week, but the government has stood by its decision to ease broader restrictions by reopening offices, public facilities and sports centres.Seoul city officials did introduce a new policy requiring people to wear protective face masks during peak hours on the subway from Wednesday.South Korea’s experience underscores the need for long-term efforts to prevent new outbreaks, said John Fleming, the Head of IFRC’s Asia Pacific Health Unit.“We need to remain vigilant for new outbreaks in countries that have flattened the curve, like South Korea,” he told Reuters. “It’s easy to get complacent when restrictions ease off.” More than 22,000 people have been tested since the nightclub cluster was first revealed last week, Seoul mayor Park Won-soon told a media briefing. Cellphone data was used to identify and locate thousands of them.More than 1,200 of the people tested were foreigners, Park said, prompting the city to send out automated text messages in English asking people to be tested. The confirmed infections include co-workers, family members and students of the people who had been in the clubs.Park expressed concern the young, mobile demographic of most of the infected could expand the outbreak.“This is very worrisome,” he said.CRIMINAL COMPLAINT Authorities in Incheon, a city west of Seoul, said they would pursue a criminal complaint against one infected clubgoer who they said had not disclosed to officials that he worked at a private school.Investigators traced the man’s movements using his cellphone data and determined that he worked at a school where five students and one instructor have since been confirmed to be infected. A student privately tutored by the man and the student’s mother also tested positive, according to Incheon city officials.“If there are more cases where people give inaccurate accounts, the government cannot take proactive measures, we can’t prevent the spread of secondary and tertiary infections, and our entire society can fall back into danger,” Kim said.The KCDC is still trying to locate about 3,000 of the 5,517 who had visited nine Itaewon clubs, for which it secured credit card transactions data involving some 1,800 people, director Jeong Eun-kyeong said. They are also carrying out epidemiological surveys on other suspected areas, including two bars in Hongdae and Sinchon, both popular hangout spots for youngsters, she said. “The biggest problem with COVID-19 is its silent transmission,” Jeong told a briefing. “Nearly 30% of the new patients are in their 20s who are very active and carry greater risks of infecting others even when they’re not showing any symptoms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-sticks-with-coronavirus-lockdown-rollback-despite-nightclub-outbreak/story-7fA3cTH195yWMsvYfYMHfL.html
13-05-2020||World||Covid-19 more than a lung disease, it can lead to blood clots, say doctors||As the coronavirus disease spreads through the United States, the doctors are noticing something strange happening to patients’ blood.Signs of blood thickening and clotting were being detected in different organs by doctors from different specialties. This would turn out to be one of the alarming ways the virus ravages the body, as doctors are starting to realise.CNN reported that the development is frightening the doctors in the US. The channel spoke to Dr Scott Brakenridge, an assistant professor on the acute care surgery team at the University of Florida College of Medicine who said that the way this disease is manifesting itself is “curious and frustrating”.He also said that in some cases, Covid-19 seems to be associated with multi-system organ failure.Nephrologists at one of the hospitals in the US noticed kidney dialysis catheters getting plugged with clots. Pulmonologists monitoring Covid-19 patients on mechanical ventilators could see portions of lungs were oddly bloodless, news agency Reuters reported.They are also worried about the age of victims skewing younger.The doctors pooled their observations, and developed a new treatment protocol in the US - patients now receive high doses of a blood-thinning drug even before any evidence of clotting appears.Clotting can develop in anyone who gets very sick and spends long periods of time immobile on a ventilator, but doctors say the problem seemed to show up sooner in Covid-19 patients as a more direct consequence of the virus.Meanwhile, a research published in the medical journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution last week said that the new coronavirus is adapting to different populations. The research was based on genetic analysis of samples from more than 7,500 people infected with Covid-19.They found almost 200 recurrent genetic mutations of the new coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2 - that show how it may be evolving as it spreads in people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-more-than-a-lung-disease-it-can-lead-to-blood-clots-say-doctors/story-cnHbjebDCNJquRqG8q9dQN.html
13-05-2020||World||Covid-19: UK economy plunges into recession||The British economy shrank 2% in the first quarter of the year from the previous three-month period, the biggest quarterly decline since the global financial crisis of 2008 even though it included just one week of the coronavirus lockdown, official figures showed Wednesday.The Office of National Statistics found that the slump was getting deeper as the quarter came to an end, with output down by 5.8% in March alone, the month when curbs on everyday life started being put in place by the British government. Prime Minister Boris Johnson put the U.K. into full lockdown on March 23, days after closing pubs and restaurants and schools.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe March figure illustrates the scale of the coronavirus slump to come, with the Bank of England, for example, warning of the biggest annual slump since 1706.“With the arrival of the pandemic, nearly every aspect of the economy was hit in March, dragging growth to a record monthly fall,” said statistician Jonathan Athow.During March, the only sectors that did grow reflected the needs of a country dealing with a pandemic - IT support, soaps and cleaning products, and the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.The quarterly decline is the biggest recorded since the fourth quarter of 2008. Since 1955, when equivalent records began, there have only been four quarters worse.Like others, the British economy is set for a recession of unprecedented proportions, with many economists predicting that the second quarter could see economic output shrink by a quarter, or even more.Last week, the Bank of England warned that the British economy could fall by around 30% in the first half of the year, before a strong recovery in the second half of the year, leaving it 14% smaller by the end of 2020. Still, even with that predicted second-half recovery, the annual fall would be the biggest in over 300 years.Much of the British economy has been mothballed over the past couple of months, with many sectors unlikely to open again for months.In addition to the 2 million estimated to be unemployed, around 7.5 million people have become economically inactive since the lockdown via the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which sees the government pay up to 80% of the salaries of workers retained, up to 2,500 pounds ($3,075) a month. On Tuesday, the Treasury chief extended the scheme for a further four months until October though suggested that firms will have to start paying a share.Some of the lockdown measures are being relaxed in England on Wednesday, with those workers who are unable to work from home, such as those in construction and manufacturing, encouraged to return to work. And a number of recreational sports, such as golf and tennis clubs, can reopen. In all cases, social distancing rules have to be observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-economy-plunges-into-recession/story-R2mnOy2IZ67P65sX6hLk0I.html

Fifty-six percent disapprove of Trump, up by 5 points in the same span. It also found that 46% of registered voters said they would back Biden in the Nov. 3 presidential election, while 38% would vote for Trump. That compared with a 2-point Biden lead in Reuters/Ipsos polling last week.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAmericans also appear to be increasingly critical of the way Trump has handled the health crisis. According to the poll, those who disapprove of Trump’s performance at the helm of the country’s pandemic response outnumber those who approve by 13 percentage points - the highest level of net disapproval since the poll started asking the question at the beginning of March. Trump initially downplayed the threat of the virus that has killed more than 80,000 people in the United States, the highest death toll of any country. He has sometimes contradicted disease specialists in his administration, promoted potential treatments that were not found effective and has accused Democratic governors of reopening their states slowly in order to hurt his re-election chances.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakThe Republican president has defended his administration’s handling of the crisis and has accused China of failing to alert the world to the severity and scope of the outbreak, which has hammered the economy.Biden has routinely led Trump among polls of registered voters this year. But his lead had been steadily eroding until this week. The public sees Trump as the stronger candidate for job creation, while Biden is seen as better suited on healthcare issues. The poll showed that the public was split over which candidate would be better for dealing with the coronavirus response. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,112 American adults, including 973 who identified as registered voters. It had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of plus or minus 4 percentage points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-approval-dips-amid-mounting-coronavirus-death-toll-trails-biden-by-8-points-poll/story-2r0eYyaCJFGSg1olJkXXdJ.html
13-05-2020||World||Mike Pompeo in Israel for West Bank annexation talks amid Covid-19 lockdown||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in Israel on Wednesday for meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his new governing partner for talks that were expected to address Israel’s plans to annex parts of the West Bank.Pompeo landed in Tel Aviv early in the morning and proceeded directly to Jerusalem, receiving an exemption from Israel’s mandatory two-week quarantine for arrivals due to the coronavirus outbreak. His visit is the first to Israel by any foreign official since January, before the country largely shut its borders to halt the spread of the pandemic.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageNetanyahu and his new coalition partner, Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz, postponed the swearing-in of their government until Thursday to accommodate Pompeo’s visit.One of the key items on the agenda in Pompeo’s talks with Netanyahu and Gantz was Israel’s stated intention to annex parts of the West Bank — a move certain to enrage the Palestinians and much of the Arab world as well as many of Israel’s Western allies.Ahead of the visit, Pompeo told the Israeli daily Israel Hayom on Tuesday that the meeting was important enough to justify flying to Israel for face-to-face talks despite the pandemic and that they would discuss efforts to keep Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, the Trump administration’s Mideast plan, and efforts to combat the coronavirus.He declined to say whether the administration supports unilateral annexation by Israel, saying he was coming to hear Netanyahu and Gantz’s perspectives on the matter. US Ambassador David Friedman, an architect of the Trump administration’s plan, has said Israel could begin annexing territory within weeks.Netanyahu and Gantz struck a power-sharing deal last month after three parliamentary elections over the past year resulted in stalemate. Under the deal, Netanyahu would remain prime minister for the next 18 months, even as he goes on trial on charges of fraud, accepting bribes and breach of trust. Afterwards a year and a half, Gantz will serve as prime minister for 18 months.The agreement also stipulates that Netanyahu can advance plans to annex Israeli settlements in the West Bank starting July 1, but that such a move must be coordinated with the US while also taking regional stability and peace agreements into consideration.Israeli hard-liners are eager to unilaterally redraw the Mideast map before November’s US presidential election. Annexation would also give President Donald Trump an accomplishment to shore up his pro-Israel base, particularly politically influential evangelical Christian voters. Wednesday’s meeting could provide an indication of how far the administration is willing to allow Netanyahu to move.Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek these territories as part of a future independent state. In the decades since, Israel has built settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem that now house nearly 700,000 Israelis. Most of the international community considers these settlements a violation of international law and obstacles to peace.In November, Pompeo stated that the administration no longer believed that Israel’s West Bank settlements were inconsistent with international law.But Netanyahu’s plans to annex occupied West Bank territory have drawn fierce criticism from across the Arab world. Earlier this week the United Arab Emirates, which has close, covert relations with Israel, voiced “deep concern” about annexation plans, while the Arab League has said annexation would be a “war crime.”The Trump administration has said it will support the annexation of West Bank territory claimed by the Palestinians for an eventual state — as long as Israel agrees to enter peace talks with the Palestinians.Under the Trump plan unveiled in January, the Palestinians would have limited statehood while Israel would annex some 30% of the West Bank. The Palestinians have rejected the plan.Most of the international community opposes Israeli annexation, saying it would scuttle hopes of a two-state solution to the conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-in-israel-to-talk-west-bank-annexation-despite-covid-19/story-dIeOp42TfusV543R79yMII.html
13-05-2020||World||US Supreme Court appears likely to reject Trump immunity claim||The Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared likely to reject President Donald Trump’s claim that he is immune from criminal investigation while in office. But the court seemed less clear about exactly how to handle subpoenas from Congress and the Manhattan district attorney for Trump’s tax, bank and financial records.The court’s major clash over presidential accountability could affect the 2020 presidential campaign, especially if a high court ruling leads to the release of personal financial information before Election Day.The justices heard arguments in two cases by telephone Tuesday that stretched into the early afternoon. The court, which includes six justices age 65 or older, has been meeting by phone because of the coronavirus pandemic.There was no apparent consensus about whether to ratify lower court rulings that the subpoenas to Trump’s accountant and banks are valid and should be enforced. The justices will meet by phone before the end of the week to take a preliminary vote on how those cases should come out, and decisions are expected by early summer.On the same day Trump’s lawyers were telling the court that the subpoenas would be a distraction that no president can afford, Trump found the time to weigh in on a long string of unrelated issues on Twitter, about Elon Musk reopening Tesla’s California plant in defiance of local authorities, the credit he deserves for governors’ strong approval ratings for their handling of the virus outbreak, the anger Asian Americans feel “at what China has done to our Country,” oil prices, interest rates, his likely opponent in the November election and his critics.The justices sounded particularly concerned in arguments over congressional subpoenas about whether a ruling validating the subpoenas would open the door to harassing future presidents.“In your view, there is really no protection against the use of congressional subpoenas for the purpose of preventing the harassment of a president,” Justice Samuel Alito said to Douglas Letter, the lawyer for the House of Representatives.Justice Stephen Breyer said he worried about a “future Sen. McCarthy,” a reference to the Communist-baiting Wisconsin senator from the 1950s, with subpoena power against a future president.But in the case involving Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.’s subpoena for Trump’s taxes, the justices showed little interest in the broadest argument made by Jay Sekulow, Trump’s lawyer, that a president can’t be investigated while he holds office.Trump had said he would make his tax returns public but hasn’t done so, unlike every other president in recent history.“President Trump is the first one to refuse to do that,” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said early in the arguments.The cases resemble earlier disputes over presidents’ assertions that they were too consumed with the job of running the country to worry about lawsuits and investigations. In 1974, the justices acted unanimously in requiring President Richard Nixon to turn over White House tapes to the Watergate special prosecutor. In 1997, another unanimous court allowed a sexual harassment lawsuit to go forward against President Bill Clinton.In those cases, three Nixon appointees and two Clinton appointees, respectively, voted against the president who chose them for the high court. The current court has two Trump appointees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.Trump’s lawyers drew on law review articles Kavanaugh wrote to buttress their arguments that the president needs to be protected from investigations.The justice, though, seemed more interested in how to balance the competing interests at play. “And the question then boils down to, how can we both protect the House’s interest in obtaining information it needs to legislate but also protect the presidency?” Kavanaugh asked.Appellate courts in Washington and New York have ruled that the documents should be turned over, but those rulings have been put on hold pending a final court ruling. The appellate decisions brushed aside the president’s broad arguments, focusing on the fact that the subpoenas were addressed to third parties asking for records of Trump’s business and financial dealings as a private citizen, not as president.House committees want records from Deutsche Bank and Capital One, as well as the Mazars USA accounting firm. Mazars also is the recipient of a subpoena from Vance.Two congressional committees subpoenaed the bank documents as part of their investigations into Trump and his businesses. Deutsche Bank has been one of the few banks willing to lend to Trump after a series of corporate bankruptcies and defaults starting in the early 1990s.Vance and the House Oversight and Reform Committee sought records from Mazars concerning Trump and his businesses based on payments that Trump’s then-personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, arranged during the 2016 presidential race to keep two women from airing their claims of extramarital affairs with Trump.Trump sued to block the subpoenas. He is being represented by personal lawyers at the Supreme Court, and the Justice Department is supporting the high-court appeal.

13-05-2020||World||881 single-day deaths, over 1.7 lakh cases: Brazil becoming new Covid-19 hotspot||Brazil reported a new record for coronavirus deaths as Latin America’s largest economy becomes the new global hotspot for the coronavirus pandemic.The country reported 881 deaths on Tuesday, pushing the total to 12,400.Last week, the country surpassed the UK’s daily death toll, trailing only the US in terms of recorded daily deaths. The number of infections has more than doubled in the past two weeks to 1,77,589. Brazil has now surpassed Germany’s 1,70,508 confirmed cases and is very close to France’s tally of 1,78,225 confirmed and probable cases.This makes Brazil the sixth most-affected country, after the United States, Britain, Italy, France and Spain.“Certainly, the increase of cases (in Brazil) in the last several days is a case of concern,” Marcos Espinal, head of the communicable diseases department at the Pan American Health Organization, told a briefing in Washington.Faced with overwhelmed hospitals and surging coronavirus deaths, Brazilian state and city governments are lurching forward with mandatory lockdowns against the will of President Jair Bolsonaro, who says job losses are more damaging than Covid-19.Brazil’s far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has drawn criticism for downplaying the pandemic, comparing the virus to a “little flu,” condemning the “hysteria” around it, and urging state and local authorities to end stay-at-home measures.Previously, the highest one-day toll in Brazil was 751 deaths on May 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/881-single-day-deaths-over-1-7-lakh-cases-brazil-becoming-new-covid-19-hotspot/story-AR7ViMOIOkXJ5Lt2yKKDwN.html
13-05-2020||World||Donald Trump wants California to let automaker Tesla reopen assembly plant||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday urged that Tesla Inc be allowed to reopen its electric vehicle assembly plant in California, joining CEO Elon Musk’s bid to defy county officials who have ordered it to remain closed.“California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely!” Trump wrote on Twitter.  California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely!On Monday, Musk said production was resuming at the automaker’s sole US vehicle factory, defying an order to stay closed and saying if anyone had to be arrested, it should be he.Musk tweeted “Thank you!” in response to Trump on Tuesday.Tesla shares were up 1.1% at $820.44 in late trading on Tuesday.Employee-parking lots at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California were packed with cars on Tuesday. Trucks could be seen driving in and out of the factory grounds.At the Fremont factory’s outbound logistics parking lot, where only a dozen Tesla cars were parked last week, hundreds of Tesla vehicles were seen on Tuesday.Tesla has planned to fully reopen its battery plant in Nevada, the Verge reported late Tuesday, citing an internal email. According to a Reuters report last week, Tesla said it had begun limited operations at its Gigafactories in Nevada and New York.The company, which on Saturday sued Alameda County, where the plant is located, over its decision that the plant should stay closed, did not comment on Trump’s tweet.Late on Monday, county health officials said they were aware Tesla had opened beyond the so-called minimum basic operations allowed during lockdown, and had notified the company it could not operate without a county-approved plan.A county health official on Friday said the county had asked all manufacturers, including Tesla, to delay operations by at least another week to monitor infection and hospitalization rates.Scott Haggerty, the Alameda County supervisor for the district where Tesla’s factory is located, told the New York Times on Saturday that the county had been working to permit Tesla to resume operations on May 18 - the same day other US automakers have been permitted to resume production in other states.Haggerty on Tuesday accused Musk on Twitter of misrepresenting what he had told the newspaper.Tesla on Saturday released a plan to keep workers returning to the factory safe.The measures, which include temperature screenings, the installation of barriers to separate work areas and protective equipment for workers, are similar to those set up by Detroit-based automakers General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler.Trump is eager for the US economy to reopen and for Americans to return to work.He has sparred with California for years over a series of issues, including immigration, vehicle fuel-efficiency standards, funding for high-speed rail and numerous environmental issues. Trump has met with Musk on several occasions during his presidency.California Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday said he had spoken with Musk several days ago and that the Tesla founder’s concerns helped prompt the state to begin its phased reopening of manufacturing last week.States and cities around the United States are experimenting with ways to reopen their economies safely after the coronavirus outbreak shuttered businesses and forced tens of millions of Americans out of work. Musk over the weekend threatened to leave California for Texas or Nevada over his factory’s closure. His move has highlighted the competition for jobs and ignited a rush to woo the billionaire executive by states that have reopened their economies more quickly in response to encouragement from Trump.Tesla also has a vehicle plant in Shanghai and is building another in Berlin. Its lawsuit on Saturday alleged that Alameda County had violated California’s constitution by defying Newsom’s orders allowing manufacturers to reopen.Newsom’s office did not immediately comment on Tuesday. In the past, Musk has discussed opening a second US factory outside California. In a tweet in February, he solicited comments on potentially opening a factory in Texas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-wants-california-to-let-automaker-tesla-reopen-assembly-plant/story-hyOI9bWxTBQL3e9JrqiBWI.html
13-05-2020||World||Russia opposes any new US attempts to impose UN sanctions against Iran||Russia’s UN ambassador said Tuesday that Moscow will oppose any attempts by the United States to extend the arms embargo on Iran and reimpose UN sanctions against the Islamic Republic.Vassily Nebenzia’s comments at a video news conference made clear that the Trump administration will have a tough time advancing any measures to impose further punishment on Iran in the UN Security Council, where Russia has veto power.The United States circulated a draft UN resolution that would indefinitely extend the UN arms embargo on Iran, which expires in October, to a small number of council members in late April.It would strike the expiration of the arms embargo from the council resolution that endorsed the 2015 nuclear deal between six major powers — the US, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany — and Iran, according to Trump administration officials and UN diplomats.Russia has made no secret of its desire to resume conventional weapons sales to Tehran.Nebenzia said the arms embargo is “a byproduct” of the nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA, and was temporary.“It expires in October. ... And for us that’s clear, that’s clear,” he said. “I do not see any reason why an arms embargo should be imposed on Iran.” Nebenzia was also asked about the controversial matter of the Trump administration possibly seeking to use the “snapback” provision in the 2015 Security Council resolution endorsing the nuclear deal, which would restore all UN sanctions against Iran that had been lifted or eased under the terms of the agreement.The Russian ambassador stressed that “to trigger a snapback you have to be a participant of the JCPOA, and the US proudly announced on May 8, 2018 that they withdrew from the JCPOA and closed the door behind.” “Now, they knock on the door and say, `Now just wait a second we forgot to do one little thing on the JCPOA, but let us back, we’ll do it and we’ll leave again,’” he said.Nebenzia called the possibility the US invoking snapback “ridiculous,” stressing that “for me it’s unequivocal. They are not members, they have no right” to use any instruments provided by the JCPOA.He also asked the Trump administration what it would gain from triggering snapback “because snapback will definitely be the end of the JCPOA.” Nebenzia that the reaction will be that “the most intrusive inspections” of any country which the International Atomic Energy Agency is carrying out in Iran “will cease.” “My question is, is it in the US interests that it happens?,” he asked.The Trump administration is not planning at this point to raise the controversial issue of “snapback,” said US officials, who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Although President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal, the US maintains that it retains the right to invoke a sanctions snapback that the deal envisaged in the event of “significant non-performance” by Iran.That position rests on a novel State Department legal argument that was first presented in December and asserts that although the US is no longer in the nuclear deal, it remains an original “participant” under the terms of the Security Council resolution that enshrined it.That resolution does, in fact, list the parties to the 2015 agreement by name, but numerous diplomats in addition to Russia have said the American argument is specious because the Trump administration has made such a point about no longer participating in the deal.Nebenzia was asked who the legal arbiter of whether the US still has standing to trigger snapback should be.“It is up to the members of the Security Council primarily, first of all, and to the remaining participants of the JCPOA itself,” he said.Nebenzia quoted a letter from Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday in which Zarif says not only is the US is “in grave violation” of the 2015 resolution for non-performance, “but it is blatantly attempting illegal paths to reverse the resolution in actual contempt for well-established principles of international law.” Solely by withdrawing from the JCPOA, the US “has lost any right,” he quoted Zarif as saying.Nebenzia said he subscribes fully to Zarif’s words, adding, “this to me looks like a truthful legal interpretation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-opposes-any-new-us-attempts-to-impose-un-sanctions-against-iran/story-w4uDUhzCQj2f47ozUTjccN.html
13-05-2020||World||Australia requests China trade talks but won’t drop inquiry push on Covid-19||Australia’s trade minister is seeking urgent talks with his Chinese counterpart after key agriculture exports were hit with suspensions and tariff threats, but said Australia will continue to push for an inquiry into the coronavirus outbreak.Trade minister Simon Birmingham requested a telephone call with Chinese commerce minister Zhong Shan after four large beef exporters were suspended by Chinese customs authorities, Birmingham’s office said on Wednesday.The beef suspensions revealed on Tuesday came just days after China proposed introducing a tariff of up to 80% on Australian barley shipments, raising concerns they were retaliatory actions by Beijing for Australia’s push for an inquiry into the coronavirus outbreak.China, which is Australia’s largest trading partner, has rejected the need for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.Chinese officials had said “privately and publicly these are unconnected matters”, Birmingham told television network Seven on Wednesday, adding that Australia sought a respectful relationship with China.Birmingham has said the beef ban was linked to issues with labelling and health certificates, while the barley tariffs were related to an anti-dumping case.The nationalist Global Times newspaper, affiliated with the official People’s Daily, said in editorial on Wednesday the suspensions of the meat processors should serve as a “wake-up call” for Australia for its unfriendly actions.Citing the push for a Covid-19 inquiry and Australia’s decision to ban Chinese firm Huawei from its 5G network, the Global Times said “concern over potential retaliatory measures from China seems totally justified given Australia’s heavy economic reliance on China”.Last month, Chinese ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye warned that Chinese consumers could boycott Australian products if Australia pursued the coronavirus inquiry. Australian government ministers described his comments as a threat of economic coercion from the country that took around 38% of all exports in 2019.Birmingham said on Wednesday Australia would continue to support an international inquiry into the coronavirus.“Australia certainly holds our own, we adopt our policy positions consistent with our values and we don’t entertain economic coercion in any sense in terms of changing our policy positions,” Birmingham said.Australia is “far from a lone voice in advancing (an inquiry)” and will support a European Union resolution at the World Health Assembly on May 17, he said.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Tuesday the country’s customs agency had found repeated instances of quarantine violations by the barred Australian beef companies and imports were suspended to “ensure the safety and health of Chinese consumers”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-requests-china-trade-talks-but-won-t-drop-inquiry-push-on-covid-19/story-saUP11deKBwrFr6Dh0beEL.html
13-05-2020||World||UN chief urges religious leaders to challenge ‘harmful messages’ amid Covid crisis||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged religious leaders on Tuesday to challenge “inaccurate and harmful messages” that are fueling rising ethno-nationalism, stigma, hate speech and conflict as the coronavirus pandemic circles the globe.The UN chief warned a video meeting on the role of faith leaders in addressing the challenges of Covid-19 that “extremists and radical groups are seeking to exploit eroding trust in leadership and feed on people’s vulnerability to serve their own ends.” He called on faith leaders to promote solidarity based on human rights and human dignity as well as social cohesion, mutual respect and understanding.Religious leaders can play “a pivotal role” in their communities and beyond “to deliver solutions to not only address the pandemic, but to recover better,” Guterres said, and they can encourage all communities “to promote non-violence and reject xenophobia, racism and all forms of intolerance.” The meeting, organized by Morocco’s U.N. Ambassador Omar Hilale, was also addressed by Catholic, Jewish and Muslim religious leaders and other U.N. officials involved in promoting inter-religious harmony.Citing an “alarming increase in violence against women and girls” as the pandemic spreads, Guterres appealed to religious leaders “to categorically condemn such acts and support shared principles of partnership, equality, respect and compassion.” He also called on the leaders to fight against disinformation and misinformation about Covid-19 by using their networks and communications to promote World Health Organization recommended measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 including physical distancing and good hygiene. And he urged them to ensure that worship, religious ceremonies and burial practices, “comply with these measures.” Miguel Moratinos, high-representative for the United Nations Alliance of Civilization, noted that religious practices and rituals that have been curtailed during the pandemic are “triggering debates among faith communities around religious rights.” “Passover, Easter and Ramadan, the three holy occasions which crisscrossed each other in April were marked differently this year in the context of social distancing,” he said.Cardinal Miguel Ángel Ayuso Guixot, president of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, told the meeting that “with the whole of humanity stumbling, we must find ourselves united in facing the pandemic.” “The way forward is to find the courage to open up the space for new forms of solidarity,” he said.He invited people of all faiths to join Pope Francis on May 14 in a day of spiritual unity, fasting, works of charity and prayers to end the coronavirus pandemic.Rabbi Arthur Schneier, a Holocaust survivor and president of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, called for a moment of silence to pray for the victims of COVID 19, the healing of the sick,and gratitude for all those on the front-lines.Schneier said faith leaders “must be in the forefront of countering the hate mongerers in our midst who have invaded social media to disseminate xenophobia, anti-Semitism, bias against minorities and conspiracy theories, exploiting this tragic time for hatred and division.” “As faith leaders we must fervently denounce and stem the scapegoating, the finger pointing and blaming others,” he said. “We must isolate the lepers of bias, heal the divisions and strengthen those forces committed to uniting a divided human family through mutual acceptance and respect and peaceful co-existence.“ “Unity and diversity, that’s what the world is all about,” said Schneier, the senior rabbi at New York’s Park East Synagogue.Recalling the Marshall Plan that helped rebuild Europe after World War II, he urged all sectors of society to come together an establish “a 21st century recovery plan to repair and improve our wounded world.” Ahmed Abaddi, secretary general of Morocco’s influential Islamic organization, the Mohammedan League of Scholars, said a great responsibility falls on the shoulders of religious leaders “to confront turmoil and challenges” including the Covid-19 pandemic and to promote the unity and fraternity shared by all religions.Abbadi, an expert in counterterrorism, said “`the radicalists and of extremists” pretend to speak in the name of religion and then they announce needs, grievances, and arguments pointing to religious teachings.“We need to face those claims and ... to respond to the expectations of the masses, how to live religiously in the 21st century,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-urges-religious-leaders-to-challenge-harmful-messages-amid-covid-crisis/story-23wXBD4i5yiMfWbo4ay2rM.html
13-05-2020||World||Green or red light: China virus app is ticket to everywhere||To enter many offices, restaurants, parks or malls in China nowadays, people must show their status on an app that determines whether they are a coronavirus threat.There is often a moment of tension before opening the app on arriving at a location.A green light lets you in anywhere. A yellow light could send you into home confinement. The dreaded red light throws a person into a strict two-week quarantine at a hotel.Such controversial use of technology has raised alarm in Europe as countries including Britain, France and Switzerland look into launching their own apps to trace infections.But use has mushroomed across China, where the government keeps a close eye on the population and collects troves of personal data. Many Chinese people say they are happy to cooperate for the greater good.“We are in a special context with this epidemic, so divulging my movements doesn’t bother me,” said Debora Lu, a 30-year-old Shanghai resident.“Human life is more important.”Travel passThere is more than one tracking app in China.An app by the State Council, China’s cabinet, uses GPS locations shared by telecommunications companies -- the kind of data sharing that might not be permissible in Western democracies.It allows authorities to look back at someone’s travel history in the previous 14 days and see if they visited areas considered high risk or were exposed to anyone with Covid-19.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe app appears to have had some glitches. The health code of many foreigners in China inexplicably turned yellow one day in April. When an AFP reporter encountered a similar issue more recently, the app turned green again after he turned it off and on several times.Other applications do not use GPS data but rely on a host of alternative information.The capital Beijing has a “Health Kit” program that displays whether people have taken a train or plane, passed a road checkpoint into the city or have been tested for the virus.Police, health authorities and neighbourhood committees that are ubiquitous in the communist-ruled country feed information into the software.Otherwise, all the apps basically work in the same way. After downloading the app, users enter their name, identity card number, telephone number and sometimes a photo. The program then gives the person a coloured health code.The apps have become a necessity for travel in China, to book train or plane tickets or enter many public places, though not all establishments require them, such as supermarkets.Giving up privacyBeijing’s city government insists the apps “are only used in the fight against the epidemic” and have access to just surnames and the last two digits of ID numbers.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreak“There is a difference between Chinese and Western culture,” said Cui Xiaohui, a professor at the big data analysis and AI research centre at the University of Wuhan -- the city where the virus first emerged late last year.“Most Chinese people are ready to sacrifice a little bit of their private life if it is really for their health,” Cui said.Li Song, a 37-year-old actor, agrees.“We are already super-connected and there is no debate on the use of geolocation,” said Li, a Shanghai resident whose app was red when he returned from a trip to France and turned green once his two-week quarantine ended.It is not so simple in European democracies.The Swiss government’s original plans to roll out an app were thwarted by parliament, which decided it needed a proper legal basis to press ahead.If approved, the Swiss app will be optional and no personal data or location information will be used, the government says.In France, the StopCovid app being developed would allow users who become sick to anonymously alert people they may have come across. It would not use GPS location technology.Britain is also trialling a new phone app to identify localised outbreaks.“China doesn’t have specific laws or regulations yet on the protection of personal data,” said Zhou Lina, a professor specialising in data protection at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.But the country has other legislation, including a cybersecurity law passed in 2017, that partially covers the issue and curbs abuses by companies online.These laws would not stop authorities from accessing personal data however, said Jeremy Daum, senior research fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center, noting that police have “enormous power” to collect information.“Government access to information is not held to the same standards and the law assumes that internal checks are sufficient to stop government abuses,” Daum said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/green-or-red-light-china-virus-app-is-ticket-to-everywhere/story-kqOdc5evxDtmD9XNHj6LlL.html
13-05-2020||World||Chinese Covid-19 vaccine could be tested, manufactured in Canada||China’s CanSino Biologics Inc, the company behind one of the few coronavirus vaccine candidates already in clinical trials, is collaborating with Canada’s National Research Council to “pave the way” for future trials in Canada, the research council said on Tuesday.The NRC said it would scale up a production process for CanSino’s vaccine at a government facility in Montreal, and that CanSino was preparing a trial application for drug regulator Health Canada. If CanSino’s vaccine works, the collaboration could help ensure that Canadians have access to it. Local trial data could reassure Health Canada that the vaccine is safe, and local manufacturing could ensure some doses are at hand.Asked whether the collaboration would make it possible for Health Canada to consider data gathered in China, NRC said that in general, data can be shared with the regulator’s approval. “Canadian clinical trials will expand on Chinese data and provide an enhanced understanding of the vaccine candidate’s safety profile,” the agency said.A vaccine that protects people from the coronavirus could end the pandemic, but finding one that works and manufacturing enough doses is a huge challenge.Relations between Canada and China have been strained since Canadian authorities arrested Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on Dec. 1, 2018 at the request of the United States. Her arrest infuriated the Chinese government, which subsequently detained two Canadian citizens - Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor - on state security charges. But in the midst of the pandemic, Canada has struggled to import protective equipment from the United States, turning in part to suppliers in China. A federal procurement website notes that Canada has “established on-the-ground support in China” to manage bulk purchases.CanSino and the NRC have worked together since 2013, and the company’s vaccine is produced using a cell line that was developed at the NRC, the agency said.CanSino Chairman Xuefeng Yu worked in Canada from 1996 to 2009, according to the company’s website, mainly for Sanofi.Shares of Hong Kong-listed CanSino rose on April 26 after the company said Health Canada had agreed to meet to discuss a clinical trial application.Separately on Tuesday, Canada promised C$600 million to replenish the GAVI vaccine alliance, to support routine vaccinations around the world. GAVI is also helping low-income countries respond to coronavirus outbreaks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-tested-manufactured-in-canada/story-6N2nGZSlLCPZQm9aA1TYvI.html

13-05-2020||World||‘Germany must help other EU states get back on their feet’: Merkel||Germany must help its European Union neighbours revive their economies after the coronavirus crisis, Chancellor Angela Merkel told a meeting of lawmakers from her conservative bloc on Tuesday, according to several participants.It is essential for Germany, as an export nation, that its EU partners also do well, Merkel told the lawmakers, with a view to consultations on an EU reconstruction programme, both the scale and the financing of which were open, the chancellor said.Germany has been the most successful large European country in curbing the spread of the virus, partly thanks to massive testing, which has prompted a partial reopening of the economy.It is in nobody’s interest for only Germany to be strong after the crisis, Merkel told the meeting, the participants said. The chancellor agreed with Ralph Brinkhaus, leader of the CDU/CSU conservative parliamentary bloc, that Germany would have to transfer considerably more money to Brussels, they added. The Bundestag would be involved in deciding on the financial aid.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicEarlier, Brinkhaus said Germany wanted to help its EU partners, but it had to know what the billions would be used for. The European Commission is expected to present revised budget proposals next week.CDU budget expert Eckhardt Rehberg painted a gloomy picture of German finances at the meeting. He warned that it would probably take until 2023 for the tax take to recover to 2019 levels, with revenues down 6.5% this year, participants said.Merkel also warned the lawmakers against getting their hopes up too much about reopening Germany’s borders, an issue her cabinet will discuss on Wednesday.Coalition sources said that officials plan to ease controls at the German borders that were introduced in response to the pandemic but they will probably not be completely abolished by May 15. The government wants to move towards normalisation in the EU’s passport-free Schengen zone.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakMerkel told the CDU/CSU parliamentary group there should be an easing of border controls, according to meeting participants. But she also spoke of a staged process and said France did not want to fully open its borders before mid-June.Citing French President Emmanuel Macron’s office, the Handelsblatt business newspaper reported that Merkel and Macron had agreed to reopen the French-German border.

But, again, if you’re China, neither one’s a good answer,” O’Brien said.“We’ve had five plagues from China in the last 20 years. We’ve had SARS, avian flu, swine flu, COVID-19 now and how longer can the world put up with this terrible public health situation that you’ve got in the People’s Republic of China that is being unleashed on the world,” the top American official said.He, however, did not mention the fifth plague to come out of from China. “I mean, this is -- at some point, it’s got to stop. We offered to send in health professionals to help the Chinese. They rejected that,” he said.When asked that the US is still looking for evidence about the origin of the virus, he refrained from giving a timeframe.“I can’t give you a timeframe on that. That’s something that we’re continuing to review and it is obviously a very serious concern.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “Look, China’s got to figure out how to deal with its public health because we cannot have another one of these virus outbreaks and plagues come from China. This was a terrible thing that happened to the entire world, not just to the United States,” he said.More than 250,000 people have died due to the coronavirus and over 4 million people infected around the world. The US is the worst-hit country with more than 80,000 deaths and 1.4 million cases.“The world economy shut down, and this isn’t the first time it’s happened. This is the fifth time it’s happened in 20 years, and it’s got to stop. China needs help.“They need help from the rest of the world. And we’re prepared to help China deal with the public health crises so we don’t face this issue again,” O’Brien added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-plagues-from-china-in-last-20-yrs-at-some-point-it-has-to-stop-us-nsa/story-KEGvYf7nhxOkYbd1P5SDeK.html
13-05-2020||World||French Covid-19 death toll overtakes Spain’s, now world’s 4th largest||France’s death toll from the coronavirus rose by 348 to 26,991 on Tuesday, overtaking Spain to become the country with the world’s fourth-highest number of fatalities after the United States, Britain and Italy. Official data had showed France’s coronavirus casualty rate trailing Spain’s closely for several weeks, with both countries’ tolls above 22,000 since April 24 and Spain’s less than 100 more than France’s over several days last week. On Tuesday the United States’ Covid-19 death toll stood at 80,606, Britain at 32,065 and Italy at 30,911. Spain followed France with 26,920.On the second day after the loosening of a strict nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus contagion, President Emmanuel Macron’s government reiterated that it was ready to tighten restrictions again if necessary. Government “deconfinement” coordinator Jean Castex told lawmakers that the first 36 hours of the easing had gone as planned and that the biggest challenge in maintaining social distancing as a bulwark against transmission of the virus was public transport in densely populated areas. “We must consider the possibility of reversing the end of lockdown. If certain indicators deteriorate, we will tighten measures again, possibly on a regional basis,” Castex said.By the end of Monday, the government had already banned the consumption of alcohol along the popular Canal Saint-Martin area in eastern Paris, where groups of young people eagerly socialised in close contact with each other, against the rules. The national government is also keeping popular Paris parks such as the Jardin du Luxembourg closed, despite calls from Mayor Anne Hidalgo to open them up to give Parisians - many of whom live in cramped flats without balconies or terraces - more space to stretch their legs.The health ministry said in a statement the number of people in hospital with Covid-19 infections fell again to 21,595 from 22,284 on Monday, continuing an uninterrupted downward trend that has lasted four weeks. The number of people in intensive care - a key measure of a health system’s ability to cope with the pandemic - also continued its downtrend, falling by 170 or 6.3% to 2,542, from more than 7,000 in early April at the height of the crisis.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases increased by 708 to 140,227 on Tuesday, up from 456 on Monday. Including 37,988 probable cases, up 94, the total number of confirmed and probable cases rose by 802 to 178,225, putting France in sixth place worldwide by that measure. The government has said it will consider locking down the country again if daily new infections rise above 3,000 again. In the past six days, the case count has increased by about 670 per day on average.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-covid-19-death-toll-overtakes-spain-s-now-world-s-4th-largest/story-yVqEDyaaFwsqDY8gvB6ZdP.html
13-05-2020||World||Russia opposes any new US attempts at UN to punish Iran||Russia’s UN ambassador said Tuesday that Moscow will oppose any attempts by the United States to extend the arms embargo on Iran and reimpose UN sanctions against the Islamic Republic.Vassily Nebenzia’s comments at a video news conference made clear that the Trump administration will have a tough time advancing any measures to impose further punishment on Iran in the UN Security Council, where Russia has veto power.The United States circulated a draft UN resolution that would indefinitely extend the UN arms embargo on Iran, which expires in October, to a small number of council members in late April.It would strike the expiration of the arms embargo from the council resolution that endorsed the 2015 nuclear deal between six major powers — the US, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany — and Iran, according to Trump administration officials and UN diplomats.Russia has made no secret of its desire to resume conventional weapons sales to Tehran.Nebenzia said the arms embargo is “a byproduct” of the nuclear deal, known as the JCPOA, and was temporary.“It expires in October. ... And for us that’s clear, that’s clear,” he said. “I do not see any reason why an arms embargo should be imposed on Iran.” Nebenzia was also asked about the controversial matter of the Trump administration possibly seeking to use the “snapback” provision in the 2015 Security Council resolution endorsing the nuclear deal, which would restore all UN sanctions against Iran that had been lifted or eased under the terms of the agreement.The Russian ambassador stressed that “to trigger a snapback you have to be a participant of the JCPOA, and the US proudly announced on May 8, 2018 that they withdrew from the JCPOA and closed the door behind.” “Now, they knock on the door and say, `Now just wait a second we forgot to do one little thing on the JCPOA, but let us back, we’ll do it and we’ll leave again,’” he said.Nebenzia called the possibility the US invoking snapback “ridiculous,” stressing that “for me it’s unequivocal. They are not members, they have no right” to use any instruments provided by the JCPOA.He also asked the Trump administration what it would gain from triggering snapback “because snapback will definitely be the end of the JCPOA.” Nebenzia that the reaction will be that “the most intrusive inspections” of any country which the International Atomic Energy Agency is carrying out in Iran “will cease.” “My question is, is it in the US interests that it happens?,” he asked.The Trump administration is not planning at this point to raise the controversial issue of “snapback,” said US officials, who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Although President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal, the US maintains that it retains the right to invoke a sanctions snapback that the deal envisaged in the event of “significant non-performance” by Iran.That position rests on a novel State Department legal argument that was first presented in December and asserts that although the US is no longer in the nuclear deal, it remains an original “participant” under the terms of the Security Council resolution that enshrined it.That resolution does, in fact, list the parties to the 2015 agreement by name, but numerous diplomats in addition to Russia have said the American argument is specious because the Trump administration has made such a point about no longer participating in the deal.Nebenzia was asked who the legal arbiter of whether the US still has standing to trigger snapback should be.“It is up to the members of the Security Council primarily, first of all, and to the remaining participants of the JCPOA itself,” he said.Nebenzia quoted a letter from Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday in which Zarif says not only is the US is “in grave violation” of the 2015 resolution for non-performance, “but it is blatantly attempting illegal paths to reverse the resolution in actual contempt for well-established principles of international law.” Solely by withdrawing from the JCPOA, the US “has lost any right,” he quoted Zarif as saying.Nebenzia said he subscribes fully to Zarif’s words, adding, “this to me looks like a truthful legal interpretation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-opposes-any-new-us-attempts-at-un-to-punish-iran/story-dg0NMHC6gfj52HfnGO9alN.html

My message to them, other than ‘thanks a fxxxing lot’ is to go vegan.”The post from the Kingston, Ontario-born rocker went viral in Canada and was criticized as offensive by some Chinese-Canadian groups.  CUTS LIKE A KNIFE. A song by me. Tonight was supposed to be the beginning of a tenancy of gigs at the @royalalberthall, but thanks to some fucking bat eating, wet market animal selling, virus making greedy bastards, the whole world is now on hold, not to mention the thousands that have suffered or died from this virus. My message to them other than "thanks a fucking lot" is go vegan. To all the people missing out on our shows, I wish I could be there more than you know.

I have love for all people and my thoughts are with everyone dealing with this pandemic around the world.” His apology was to “any and all that took offence”.Winner of multiple Grammy awards, Adams is known for a series of superhits, including the singles, Run To You, Summer of ’69, Heaven, and (Everything I Do) I Do It For You, among many others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bryan-adams-apologises-as-his-bat-eating-covid-19-rant-faces-flak/story-mgLaM8wGGmfsklPsjafNOP.html
13-05-2020||World||New York has seen 100 children with illness linked to Covid-19: Governor Cuomo||Amber Dean had recovered from a mild bout of the coronavirus and her family of five had just ended their home quarantine when her oldest son, 9-year-old Bobby, fell ill.“At first it was nothing major, it seemed like a tummy bug, like he ate something that didn’t agree with him,” said Dean, who lives with her husband and three young children in the western New York town of Hornell. “But by the next day, he couldn’t keep anything down and his belly hurt so bad he couldn’t sit up.” At the local hospital emergency room, doctors suspected an appendix infection and sent him home with instructions to see his pediatrician.It was only later, after Bobby’s condition took an alarming turn for the worse, that doctors realized he was among the small but growing number of children with a mysterious inflammatory syndrome thought to be related to the virus.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that New York is now investigating about 100 cases of the syndrome, which affects blood vessels and organs and has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock. Three children in the state have died and Cuomo advised all hospitals to prioritize Covid-19 testing for children presenting with symptoms.In New York City, which has reported at least 52 children sick with the syndrome, Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday urged parents to call their pediatricians promptly if their children show symptoms including persistent fever, rash, abdominal pain and vomiting.That’s what Bobby Dean’s family did, even though they live in Steuben County, which has only 239 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and is in a part of the state set to start reopening some workplaces on Friday.The family doctor performed a coronavirus test the day after his trip to the emergency room, but the results would take 24 hours. By that night, the boy’s fever had spiked, his abdomen was swollen, he was severely dehydrated and his heart was racing. His father, Michael Dean, drove him to Golisano Children’s Hospital in Rochester, 90 minutes away.“At Rochester they did a rapid Covid test and it came back positive,” Amber Dean said. For the next six days, she was at his hospital bedside while Bobby was hooked up to IV lines and a heart monitor. He came home on Mother’s Day.“It never affected his respiratory system, it was his heart that it affected,” Dean said. Inflamed lymph nodes caused the abdominal pain, she said. “They’re hoping he pulls through with 100% recovery but they said there have been children with lasting effects.” Children elsewhere in the US and in Europe have also been hospitalized with the condition known as pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome.In New York, the syndrome has been found across a wide range of young people. A 5-year-old boy, 7-year-old boy and an 18-year-old woman have died.About 23 percent of cases have occurred in children under age 5, about 29% between the ages of 5 and 9, about 28% between ages 10 and 14 and 16% between the ages 15 and 19.“This is a truly disturbing situation and I know parents around the state and parents around the country are very concerned about this, and they should be,” Cuomo said. “If we have this issue in New York it’s probably in other states.” Dr Juan Salazar, the physician-in-chief at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, said two patients there are believed to have the rare condition, which he said often appears to present itself two to four weeks after a child has recovered from Covid-19, often without ever being diagnosed with the infection. Yale Health has said it’s treating three children believed to have the syndrome.Cuomo announced last week that New York is developing national criteria for identifying and responding to the syndrome at the request of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In testimony Tuesday before a Senate committee on the administration’s coronavirus response, Dr Anthony Fauci said children in general do better than adults and the elderly, but he warned there is still much to learn about the virus.“For example right now, children presenting with Covid-19 who actually have a very strange inflammatory syndrome very similar to Kawasaki syndrome,” Fauci said. “I think we better be very careful that we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects.” As Bobby Dean’s boisterous energy and sardonic sense of humor returns, his mom is vigilant for signs of illness in her younger children, aged 7 months and 3 years.“It’s a pretty scary thing, watching your child be hooked up to all these wires and IVs and there’s nothing you can do,” Dean said. “In my opinion, right now, I would not let your child out in public.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-has-seen-100-children-with-illness-linked-to-covid-19-governor-cuomo/story-4Mudx8jQg29LZXpyt2iL5O.html
13-05-2020||World||Joe Biden says Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to be on policy panel||Joe Biden said Tuesday that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will serve on one of the policy task forces that his campaign is preparing to launch as he reaches out to supporters of Bernie Sanders and others on the left.In an interview with the CBS affiliate in Las Vegas, Biden offered the New York congresswoman’s name as an example of the kind of person who is being included on the panels, which were announced as Sanders left the Democratic presidential race last month.The presumptive Democratic nominee has not yet rolled out what he’s said would be a half-dozen panels addressing key policy issues. “We’ve set up joint committees together to deal with how we would deal with everything from the virus all the way down to education, the criminal justice system, the New Green Deal, etc.,” Biden said, referring to the Green New Deal, a climate initiative sponsored by Ocasio-Cortez.Ocasio-Cortez’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment nor did the Biden campaign when asked for further details on her role.Biden Says He’s Winning Despite Lockdown Joe Biden pushed back Tuesday against the notion that his campaign could be suffering because he is limited to virtual events during the pandemic, and he pointed to polls that show him leading President Donald Trump.“Right now the idea that somehow we are being hurt by my keeping to the rules and following the instructions that have been put forward by the docs is absolutely bizarre,” he said in an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America” when asked when he would return to the campaign trail. “I reject the premise that this is hurting us.”Since mid-March, Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has stayed in his home in Wilmington, Delaware where his campaign has built a studio for virtual events. Meanwhile, Trump has had an almost daily news conference and recently started traveling.Biden said he missed interacting with voters and is eager to return to public events, but he would only do so following the advice of medical experts.“The president should follow the rules instead of showing up to places without masks,” he said. -- Tyler Pager||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-to-be-on-policy-panel/story-44wlKKqsmlZNBttYGdc0tK.html

13-05-2020||World||Brazil’s Bolsonaro denies shielding family from federal police investigations||Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday denied that he attempted during a videotaped Cabinet meeting last month to shield his relatives and friends from federal police investigations.Hours before Bolsonaro issued the denial, the two-hour video of the meeting was reviewed by prosecutors, police investigators, lawyers and government officials.The existence of the video emerged after former Justice Minister Sérgio Moro last month accused Bolsonaro of seeking to interfere with Brazilian federal police investigations in Rio de Janeiro during that Cabinet meeting. Bolsonaro, his family members and friends have extensive business interests in Rio.Moro, hailed by many Brazilians as an anti-corruption hero, has told investigators that Bolsonaro threatened to fire him during the Cabinet meeting if he failed to make changes in the top ranks of Brazil’s federal police and in its Rio division.Also read: Bolsonaro fires Brazil’s health minister, calls to reopen economyWhile Bolsonaro claimed the video did not prove the allegations, Moro’s lawyer, Rodrigo Sánchez Rios, said in a statement that he was among those invited to watch it and that the contents proved his client’s allegations.The developments are important because Bolsonaro is trying to avoid allegations of misconduct that could lead to him being suspended from office for a trial before the country’s Supreme Court or impeached in Congress.Former President Dilma Rousseff, a nemesis of Bolsonaro’s, was impeached and removed from office in 2016. The far-right Bolsonaro, who has lost support in Brazil’s congress in recent months, insists he will not meet a similar fate.Speaking to reporters after the video was viewed, Bolsonaro said he never meant to imply that he planned to interfere in police investigations, but that he was concerned about family members’ safety in Rio. He was stabbed during a 2018 presidential campaign appearance.“The safety of my family is one thing. I am not and I was never worried about the federal police,” Bolsonaro said. “The federal police never investigated anyone of my family, that does not exist in the video.”He added that the tape of the meeting should have been destroyed and accused journalists of being “misinformed” about the gathering.After Moro resigned, Bolsonaro replaced the head of the federal police and the chief of its Rio division. Supporters of the president have protested against Supreme Court justices and the former justice minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-s-bolsonaro-denies-shielding-family-from-federal-police-investigations/story-nXPk1IiCVMweV93BcCxI1H.html
