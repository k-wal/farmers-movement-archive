21-05-2020||World||2.4 million more Americans file for unemployment benefits||President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused China of spreading “disinformation” about the Covid-10 pandemic on orders emanating “from the top”, a reference perhaps to President Xi Jinping.Trump and his Republican allies have railed against China in effort to shift the blame the roiling epidemic in the United States and the severe toll it has taken on the economy.“Its disinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe is a disgrace,” Trump tweeted late night, reacting to a statement from a Chinese government spokesperson. “It all comes from the top,” he went on to say in a rare attack on the Chinese president. “They could have easily stopped the plague, but they didn’t!”Thursday morning, the US labor department reported more than 2.4 million workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, taking up the total of those laid off in the nine weeks of Covid-19 lockdowns to 38.6 million.The new weekly layoff number was lower than the revised total for last week of 2.6 million. Though it has continued to decline from the peak of 6.7 million in March end, layoffs have not ceased with businesses downsizing operation or shutting down completely every day, taking a severe toll on the economy.New infections and fatalities have also dropped considerably allowing all 50 states to reopen by partially lifting restrictions. But normalcy is not in sight yet.The United States is now staring at the 100,000 fatalities mark, as the toll went up up to 93,471 Thursday with 1,518 deaths in the last 24 hours. Infections rose by 23,285 to 1.55 million over the same period. Democratic congressional leaders have asked the president to order the national flag to fly at half most on public buildings when the toll crosses 100,000.Though New York city, the epicenter of the American epidemic, continues to improve. But governor Andrew Cuomo has said new coronavirus cases continue to spread among lower income and minority communities. Of 8,000 antibody tests conducted in those areas found an infection rate of 34% in the Bronx, 29% in Brooklyn and 25% in Queens; which were way higher than the citywide average off 19.9%.Meanwhile, a new study has shown that thousands of lives would have been saved if the United States had started locking down its cities earlier than it did. If the lockdown had started on March 1, 54,000 fewer people would have died, the study by Columbian University said. And toll would have been 36,000 less if the curbs went into effect just a week before they did on March 16.And Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has said he cannot rule out a second wave of Covid-19 cases later in the year during the usual flu seas next winter. “We’ve seen evidence that the concerns it would go south in the southern hemisphere like flu (are coming true), and you’re seeing what’s happening in Brazil now,” Redfield told Financial Times Wednesday. “And then when the southern hemisphere is over I suspect it will reground itself in the north.” He had earlier said the second wave could be more devastating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-4-million-more-americans-file-for-unemployment-benefits/story-QSdl91J0wVnVV0xVUFV8cK.html
21-05-2020||World||Covid-19 update: UK deaths cross 36,000, including 695 Indians||The number of daily deaths and new cases is showing a steady decline, particularly in London, but new figures on Thursday revealed the UK-wide death toll had reached a cumulative figure of 36,042 (including 695 ‘Indians’ in England) and 250,098 cases.According to NHS England, 695 members of the non-white community categorised as ‘Indian’ died after contracting coronavirus as of May 19. The UK-wide death toll of 36,042 includes a day rise of 338.Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced renewed calls from within and outside the ruling party to scrap the immigration health surcharge levied on Indian and other non-EU health professionals who need to pay 400 pounds per person per year to access the National Health Service (NHS).Senior Conservative party called it ‘immoral and monstrous’ that migrants putting their lives at risk to treat coronavirus patients had to pay the surcharge, which amounts to them for it twice, since they also pay income tax, which funds the NHS. The surcharge is levied on all non-EU migrants, and the demand is to scrap it for doctors and other healthcare professionals.Johnson told the House of Commons that he recognised the contribution of migrants and recalled his own recent life-saving treatment at the hands of nurses from outside the UK, but refused to scrap the surcharge on the ground that the NHS needs the funding.The surcharge, payable at the time a migrant applies for a UK visa, is to rise to 624 pounds per person per year from October. Various organisations, including the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have campaigned the the surcharge to be waived.There are indications that some flights will operate from early June to selected holiday destinations within the UK and Europe as part of plans to gradually reopen the economy while maintaining social distancing and other curbs.The Home Office meanwhile extended the offer of permanent stay (indefinite leave to remain), free of charge, to the families and dependants of non-EU NHS support staff and social care workers who die as result of contracting coronavirus. It will be applicable retrospectively.Home secretary Priti Patel said: “Every death in this crisis is a tragedy, and sadly some NHS support staff and social care workers have made the ultimate sacrifice in the pursuit of saving the lives of others”.“When I announced the introduction of the bereavement scheme in April, I said we would continue to work across government to look at ways to offer further support. Today we are extending the scheme to NHS support staff and social care workers”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-uk-deaths-cross-36-000-including-695-indians/story-sOiK45kypQG0iCD16ftJJO.html
21-05-2020||World||Firmly opposed to US sale of torpedoes to Taiwan, China fumes||China on Thursday said it firmly opposes the planned US sale of advanced torpedoes to Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, which Beijing claims is a breakaway province.The Chinese foreign ministry reacted angrily after reports emerged from Taiwan about the sale valued at some $180 million.Spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Beijing had lodged “solemn representations” with the US to complain about the sale, adding that it firmly opposes the deal.Zhao said China urges the US to strictly abide by the “one China” principle, stop selling arms to Taiwan, avoid further damage to Sino-US relations and maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.Earlier, media reports said the US government had notified Congress of a possible sale of advanced torpedoes to Taiwan worth around $180 million, a decision that was bound to trigger angry reaction from Beijing.Washington like the majority of countries worldwide including India do not have official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, an island off China’s southern coast.It is however bound by law to provide Taiwan the means to protect itself.The announcement of the sale coincided with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen searing in for her second term in office, and saying that she strongly rejects China’s sovereignty claims.China responded that “reunification” was inevitable and that it would never tolerate Taiwan’s independence.The latest point of conflict between Beijing and Washington added to the existing problems between the two countries including the ongoing exchange over the origin of the pandemic-causing Covid-19 virus.The US has repeatedly criticised China for mishandling the outbreak and hiding information about the virus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.China has hit back, saying accusing the Donald Trump administration of politicising a global health problem to deflect attention from its own failure to handle the outbreak in the country.China has more or less brought the outbreak under control with numbers stabilising near 83000 infections and over 4600 deaths.The US has so far reported more than 1.55 million infections and over 93,000 deaths, according to the latest tally by Johns Hopkins University. ■||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/firmly-opposed-to-us-sale-of-torpedoes-to-taiwan-china-fumes/story-giv24ye8A0oaMCSvrLCd9K.html
21-05-2020||World||Nearly 39 million Americans unemployed since Covid-19 hit US||The number of Americans thrown out of work since the coronavirus crisis struck two months ago has climbed to nearly 39 million, the government said Thursday.More than 2.4 million people applied for unemployment benefits last week in the latest wave of layoffs from the outbreak that has triggered nationwide business shutdowns and brought the economy to its knees, the Labor Department reported. That brings the running total to a staggering 38.6 million.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here An additional 2.2 million sought aid under a new federal program for self-employed, contractor and gig workers, who are now eligible for unemployment benefits for the first time. Those figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal variations, so they are not included in the overall number of applications.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the unemployment rate could peak in May or June at 20% to 25% — a level unseen since the depths of the Great Depression in the 1930s.As of April, unemployment stood at 14.7%, a figure also unmatched since the era when President Franklin D. Roosevelt was assuring Americans that the only thing to fear was fear itself.The breathtaking downturn — unprecedented in its speed — has turned up the pressure on politicians to lift the lockdowns that are destroying businesses and livelihoods.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the economy is shrinking at a 38% annual rate in the April-June period, by far the worst quarterly contraction on record.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage About 5 million people worldwide have been confirmed infected, and over 328,000 deaths have been recorded. That includes more than 93,000 in the US and around 165,000 in Europe, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University and based on government data. Experts believe the true toll is significantly higherMeanwhile, doubts grew over ambitious plans by European governments to use contact-tracing smartphone apps to fight the spread of the virus as they ease their lockdowns and restart their economies.British Security Minister James Brokenshire told the BBC that an app that was supposed to be introduced by mid-May is not ready, and he suggested “technical issues” were to blame.Similarly, France delayed last week’s sdplanned roll-out of its app, saying it won’t be ready before next month because of technical problems and privacy concerns.Experts say that being able to quickly identify people exposed to the virus can help stop the spread of the scourge.Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte said Thursday that the country’s app will begin testing in the coming days, and Spain plans to try out its technology at the end of June in the Canary Islands.Meanwhile, drug maker AstraZeneca said it has secured agreements to produce 400 million doses of a still experimental and unproven Covid-19 vaccine that is being tested at the University of Oxford, one of the most advanced projects in the search for a vaccine.While no vaccine has yet been proven to work against the virus, the pharmaceutical industry is already working to ramp production so that massive doses will be available quickly.The Anglo-Swedish company reported it has received more than $1 billion from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority for the development, production and delivery of the vaccine, starting this fall.AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said the company “will do everything in our power to make this vaccine quickly and widely available.’’Around the world, the effort to get back to business is raising worries over the risk of new infections, from hard-hit Milan, Italy, to meatpacking plants in Colorado and garment factories in Bangladesh.In China, the communist leadership took extensive precautions to prevent infections as it prepared for the opening of its National People’s Congress on Friday and a parallel meeting of advisers on Thursday. The meetings in Beijing were delayed for two months because of the outbreak.An outbreak at the congress would be a potential public relations nightmare as President Xi Jinping showcases Beijing’s apparent success in curbing the virus that emerged in the Wuhan late last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-39-million-americans-unemployed-since-covid-19-hit-us/story-XcVteBDarWlSZGKdEoOZuK.html
21-05-2020||World||China set to implement controversial security law in HK, likely to escalate protest||China will introduce a draft resolution for a new national security law in Hong Kong proscribing secession, terrorism and foreign interference in the specially administered region (SAR), a top official announced late on Thursday night.The move could escalate tension in the city, which has seen largescale pro-democracy protests since last June.The draft resolution will be introduced as a motion and discussed during the opening session of China’s Parliament, National People’s Congress (NPC) on Friday.The announcement was made at a late-night press conference by the NPC spokesperson, Zhang Yesui.The passing of the motion is expected to be a formality as NPC is largely a ruber-stamp parliament under the ruling Communist Party of China.Zhang said that because of new circumstances and need, the NPC is exercising the power enshrined in the constitution to establish and improve a legal framework and mechanism for safeguarding national security and upholding the institutional framework for ‘one country, two systems’.”He added: “Hong Kong is an inseparable part of the People’s Republic of ChinaThe NPC is the country’s highest organ of state power. National security is the bedrock underpinning the stability of the country. Safeguarding national security serves the fundamental interest of all Chinese, and Hong Kong patriots included.”“This also shows that the central government would safeguard China’s core interests at all costs,” a state media report said.The writing in of the new security law into Hong Kong’s special charter, or Basic Law, could see the mainland’s control over the SAR tighten substantially.The city has violent protests since last June on that very issue: Beijing’s apparent tightening of control over the city and its impact on freedoms including that of free speech and expression.The “one country, two systems” system that governs Hong Kong hast been thrown into question by student-led pro-democracy protests that went on for months last year and have shown signs of building up again in recent weeksThe new law would ban all seditious activities aimed at toppling the central government and external interference in Hong Kong’s affairs. It would also target terrorist acts in Hong Kong, an earlier report by the South China Morning Post said.The move to introduce the draft resolution comes as the city’s delegates to the NPC sessions, beginning Friday, were said to have met Xia Baolong, director of the State Council’s (China’s cabinet) Hong Kong and Macau Office (HKMAO) on Thursday evening.The implementation of the new law – if it is carried out – would “…mark a significant departure from Beijing’s earlier decision to allow Hong Kong to draft and enact the legislation within its own legislature,” the SCMP report said.Separately, China said Thursday it supports improving the system and mechanism related to the constitution and basic law of Hong Kong and Macau.The former European colonies (Hong Kong was under the British and Macau under the Portuguese) returned to Chinese rule in the late 1990s under a system aimed at preserving their economic systems and ensuring their autonomy, known as “one country, two systems”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-to-introduce-security-bill-to-tighten-control-on-hong-kong-reports/story-qrhAVKWXjHOSUACm2kDxqL.html
21-05-2020||World||Scientists propose new truncated process for developing Covid-19 vaccines at “pandemic speed”||Scientists have proposed a new truncated process for developing vaccines quickly during a pandemic, with a fast start and many steps executed in parallel before confirming a successful outcome of another step, an approach they claim can help stop the Covid-19 crisis. According to the researchers from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), vaccine development is a lengthy, expensive process with high rates of attrition, typically taking multiple candidates, and many years to produce a licensed therapeutic. CEPI, which includes Nicole Lurie, Distinguished Health Policy Fellow from the University of Pennsylvania in the US, is a foundation that finances independent research projects to develop vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. In an article, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, experts from CEPI said vaccine developers usually follow a linear sequence of steps, with multiple pauses for data analysis or manufacturing-process checks due to the cost and high failure rates of the process. However, with a quick start and phases executed in parallel, such as scaling up manufacturing before successful confirmation of the outcomes, the scientists believe the process can be fast-tracked, but with high financial risks. They said for some vaccine platforms which have yielded significant success in humans, phase I clinical trials may be able to proceed in parallel with testing in animal models. According to the researchers, an ideal platform for this new paradigm would support development from viral sequencing to clinical trials in less than 16 weeks. Such a truncated process, they said, can demonstrate the successful and consistent activation of immune responses in humans, and be suitable for a large-scale manufacturing platform that is independent of the pathogen. Citing an example, they said Moderna’s mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine entered a phase I clinical trial on March 16, less than 10 weeks after the first genetic sequences were released. The proposed paradigm, the scientists said, requires multiple activities to be conducted at financial risk without knowing whether the vaccine candidate will be safe and effective. Among those with the greatest potential for quick development are DNA- and RNA-based platforms, the researchers noted in the article. They explained that both these genetic material-based vaccines can be made quickly since they do not require culture or fermentation, but instead use synthetic processes. According to the researchers, the use of next-generation genome sequencing may also cut development time of more conventional vaccines during epidemics. Among other ways of hastening the process, they said testing in a suitable animal model, and rigorous safety monitoring in clinical trials will be critical. The scientists also suggested that manufacturing steps could be scaled up to commercial levels before data on the trial’s outcomes are available. However, they cautioned that building manufacturing capacity can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. With novel platform technologies, the article also warned that there is additional cause for concern since large-scale production of these vaccine prototypes has never been done. For these platforms, the scientists said, facilities capable of producing large quantities must be identified, technologies transferred, and manufacturing processes adapted, all without knowing if the vaccine candidate is viable. But since it’s unclear if these new platforms will be scalable to produce sufficient quantities of vaccine fast enough, they recommended that vaccines also be developed using tried-and-true methods in parallel, even if they take longer to enter clinical trials. One possible way, the scientists said, would be to test several vaccines simultaneously in a clinical trial design which uses a single, shared control group, so that more participants would receive an active vaccine. However, they said this approach can be logistically and statistically complex, and may generate head-to-head comparative data which different vaccine developers may seek to avoid. “A global financing system that supports end-to-end development, large-scale manufacturing, deployment, and ensures fair allocation, and protects private-sector partners from significant financial losses will be a critical component of future pandemic preparedness,” the researchers concluded in the article.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-propose-new-truncated-process-for-developing-covid-19-vaccines-at-pandemic-speed/story-pz8ZspQu0TJHD1OqT2QAaO.html
21-05-2020||World||Covid-19 update: AstraZeneca ramps up capacity ahead of Oxford trial results||Biopharma major AstraZeneca on Thursday said it has ramped up its capacity to produce a vaccine for Covid-19 on a wide scale ahead of initial results “expected shortly” from ongoing human trials at the University of Oxford.The capacity is based on the company’s agreements with producers in several countries - together, it said it now has total capacity sourced for one billion doses through 2020 and into 2021. First deliveries are expected in September.It is in discussions with the Serum Institute of India to increase production. AstraZeneca has received support of more than $1 billion from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority for the development, production and delivery of the vaccine.In addition, the company said it is engaging with international organisations such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, Gavi the Vaccine Alliance and the World Health Organisation for the fair allocation and distribution of the potential vaccine around the world.AstraZeneca has finalised its licence agreement with Oxford University for the recombinant adenovirus vaccine. The licensing of the vaccine, formerly ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and now known as AZD1222, follows the recent global development and distribution agreement with the University’s Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group.A Phase I/II clinical trial of AZD1222 began last month to assess safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in over 1,000 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years across several trial centres in southern England.“Data from the trial is expected shortly which, if positive, would lead to late-stage trials in a number of countries. AstraZeneca recognises that the vaccine may not work but is committed to progressing the clinical program with speed and scaling up manufacturing at risk” the company said.CEO Pascal Soriot said: “This pandemic is a global tragedy and it is a challenge for all of humanity. We need to defeat the virus together or it will continue to inflict huge personal suffering and leave long-lasting economic and social scars in every country around the world”.“We are so proud to be collaborating with Oxford University to turn their ground-breaking work into a medicine that can be produced on a global scale. We would like to thank the US and UK governments for their substantial support to accelerate the development and production of the vaccine. We will do everything in our power to make this vaccine quickly and widely available.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-update-astrazeneca-ramps-up-capacity-ahead-of-oxford-trial-results/story-cKK7FCJUtOa56OWnUPS4AM.html
21-05-2020||World||Covid-19: China vaccine maker inks Canada deal to develop second shot||Leading Chinese vaccine developer CanSino Biologics Inc. has inked a deal to test and sell a separate Canadian vaccine candidate as the race for immunization intensifies globally.In addition to developing its own vaccine together with the Chinese military, CanSino will partner with Vancouver-based Precision NanoSystems Inc. to co-develop another potential vaccine, according to a joint press release Wednesday.The Chinese company will conduct testing of Precision’s experimental vaccine and has the right to commercialize it in Asia excluding Japan, said the statement.Widely viewed as one of the front-runners in the race to develop a successful vaccine, the new deal adds to CanSino’s chances of being among the first to deliver immunizing shots. Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to make any effective vaccine against the coronavirus that is developed by China accessible and affordable globally as a “public good.”CanSino’s own vaccine is currently in the second of three phases of human testing and is among five Chinese candidates to have reached that advanced stage -- more than the U.S. and Europe combined.CanSino’s stock surged in Hong Kong on Thursday morning before abruptly reversing gains in the afternoon. Overall, the company’s head start in coronavirus vaccine development has made it the second-most overbought stock among mid-cap and big-caps in Hong Kong.The Tianjin-based company was set up in 2009 by vaccine industry veterans who had previously worked for global pharmaceutical firms like Sanofi and AstraZeneca Plc. The company’s partnered with the Chinese military before, developing a shot against Ebola that was approved domestically in 2017, although it was not deployed internationally.The vaccine that CanSino will co-develop with Precision Nanosystems harnesses an experimental approach also being used by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna Inc. Known as mRNA vaccines, they contain the virus’s genetic sequence to instruct cells to make antigens that elicit a response from the immune system.Governments, research institutes and companies around the world have accelerated vaccine development that usually takes years into several months as pressure grows for scientists to find a way out of the pandemic. A vaccine is considered a crucial step toward lifting social-distancing measures and safely reopening economies, schools and events around the globe.Despite growing tensions between China and some western countries who have faulted it for a delay in sharing information about the pandemic, Chinese vaccine developers have inked cooperation pacts with foreign companies.Chinese drugmaker Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co. announced in March a partnership with Germany’s BioNTech SE to help test its mRNA vaccine in China.Besides the new partnership, CanSino has also already received approval to conduct human clinical trials in Canada for the vaccine it is co-developing with the Chinese military.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-china-vaccine-maker-inks-canada-deal-to-develop-second-shot/story-NPTWerQ7VZanTNuH3P06xM.html
21-05-2020||World||Pompeo calls China coronavirus response ‘paltry’ compared to damage done||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took fresh aim at China over the coronavirus on Wednesday, calling the $2 billion Beijing has pledged to fight the pandemic “paltry” compared to the hundreds of thousands of lives lost and trillions of dollars of damage.Pompeo rejected President Xi Jinping’s claim that Beijing had acted with transparency after the outbreak in China, and said if Xi wanted to show that, he should hold a news conference and allow reporters to ask him anything they liked.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“President Xi claimed this week that China is acting with openness, transparency responsibility. I wish it were so,” Pompeo told a State Department news conference, charging that Beijing continued to withhold virus samples and access to facilities, to censor discussion, “and much, much more.”US-China tensions have spiked in recent weeks, with Pompeo and President Donald Trump slamming Beijing’s handling of the outbreak. The United States has been hardest hit in the global pandemic.At a time when many nations are urging unity and cooperation to ramp up the virus battle, Trump has proposed quitting the World Health Organization over its response and called it a “puppet of China,” while Xi has pledged it $2 billion.“I look forward to seeing them fulfill that $2-billion commitment,” Pompeo said. “China’s contributions to fighting the pandemic are paltry, compared to the cost that they have imposed on the world.”“This plague has cost roughly 90,000 American lives, more than 36 million Americans have lost their jobs since March; globally 300,000 lives. Could be as much as $9 trillion, according to our estimates, cost imposition on the world of the Chinese Communist Party’s failures,” Pompeo said.In Beijing, China called Pompeo “extremely irresponsible”, and urged him to explain shortcomings in the US response to the virus.“Why didn’t the US government take any control and prevention measures between January and March?” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian.“Why did it fail to stem the fast spread of coronavirus in the United States? He has a responsibility to explain this to the world.” Pompeo also accused China of threatening Australia with “economic retribution” for seeking an independent inquiry into the outbreak’s origins and charged that WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had had “unusually close ties to Beijing ... long before this current pandemic,” something “deeply troubling.”The WHO did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Pompeo’s accusations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-calls-china-coronavirus-response-paltry-compared-to-damage-done/story-6V0Y2n4DS01759pDIWzG5I.html
21-05-2020||World||AstraZeneca gets $1 billion from US to make Oxford vaccine||AstraZeneca Plc received more than $1 billion in U.S. government funding for an experimental Covid-19 vaccine from the University of Oxford, a boost to one of the world’s fastest-moving projects to develop a shot.The investment accelerates a race to secure vaccine supplies, seen as a key step toward restarting global economies after a lockdown-induced slump. Stock markets have been rising and falling on developments in research labs as investors weigh the prospects.The U.K. drugmaker received the money from the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and said it has secured capacity to make 1 billion doses. Although AstraZeneca has said it expects to have shots ready as soon as September, the company’s vaccine candidate is still in human trials, with no guarantee of success.The funding for AstraZeneca is part of the Operation Warp Speed effort to secure vaccines for the U.S., according to a statement from the Health and Human Services Department. Astra can receive up to $1.2 billion under the agreement, and the U.S. expects 300 million doses to be available as early as October.Other ProjectsThe U.S. “is making multiple major investments in developing and manufacturing promising vaccines long before they’re approved so that a successful vaccine will reach the American people without a day wasted,” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said. Oxford’s vaccine is the fourth to receive BARDA support.The U.S. agency has also provided funding for French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi, including $30 million for its Covid vaccine and a $226 million award in December to increase production capacity for its pandemic influenza vaccine. A Covid vaccine developed by the company will probably go to Americans first if the company can successfully deliver one, Chief Executive Officer Paul Hudson said last week in an interview with Bloomberg News.Sanofi said later that it would make the shot available everywhere. While the absence of a European counterpart to BARDA has slowed efforts to secure supplies, Hudson said the French company is in talks with several governments on possible arrangements.Supplying the U.K. with vaccine will be a priority for AstraZeneca, CEO Pascal Soriot has said. Astra plans to make as many as 30 million doses available in Britain by September and has committed to delivering 100 million this year.Fair AllocationAstra said it’s working with groups including the World Health Organization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, on making sure the vaccine is allocated fairly. The company said it has supply agreements for 400 million doses.“Several more agreements are expected to deliver AstraZeneca’s commitment to ensure global access,” a spokesman said in an email. “These agreements are happening in parallel in order to ensure broad and equitable supply of the vaccine throughout the world at no profit during the pandemic.”The shares fell 1.4% early Thursday in London.The U.S. funding will support a final-stage clinical trial with 30,000 participants, as well as tests in children, AstraZeneca said.Some doubts have been raised about the potential effectiveness of the Oxford vaccine after early results in monkeys were released. While the shot may have protected animals against severe infections, the results were weak compared with those of a test of a vaccine under development by Sinovac Biotech in Beijing, said William Haseltine, a former Harvard University HIV researcher, in a blog post.Infections in MonkeysThe comparison is inapt for studies carried out with different types of vaccines given in varying doses, in monkeys who were infected with different levels of virus, the Oxford researchers said in a statement. “In the end it is the impact on clinical disease that matters,” they said.Dozens of other vaccine projects are underway around the world, from the U.S. to China, drawing in major pharma giants, university labs and others. Moderna Inc. shares jumped earlier this week after the U.S. biotech revealed positive early results from its experimental vaccine.President Xi Jinping of China has said any successful vaccine developed there will be made available as a global public good.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-gets-1-billion-from-us-to-make-oxford-vaccine/story-Z9rwskitlqY4cdlaOdshBM.html
21-05-2020||World||Brazil coronavirus outbreak worsens as country could soon be No. 2 in cases||Brazil’s coronavirus outbreak worsened on Wednesday and the South American nation could soon have the second-highest number of cases in the world as the Health Ministry reported 888 new deaths and nearly 20,000 new infections in a single day. Brazil might soon trail only the United States in the number of coronavirus cases. Russia currently has the second-highest number of cases. Brazil’s coronavirus death toll is 18,859.Brazil’s confirmed case tally now stands at 291,579, according to the Health Ministry. On Monday, Brazil overtook Britain to become the country with the third-highest number of infections and registered a daily record of 1,179 deaths on Tuesday.President Jair Bolsonaro has been widely criticized for his handling of the outbreak. The far-right former army captain has long snubbed social-distancing measures, arguing instead for the reopening the economy. He has also become an increasingly strong advocate for the malaria drug chloroquine as a possible remedy for Covid-19, despite warnings from health experts.On Wednesday, the Health Ministry issued new guidelines for wider use of anti-malarial drugs in mild coronavirus cases.Interim Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello, an active-duty army general, authorized the modified protocol after two trained doctors left the ministry’s top job under pressure to promote the early use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. “We are at war. Worse than defeat would be the shame of not putting up a fight,” Bolsonaro tweeted about the government decision to put forward the drugs without proof of their effectiveness.Gonzalo Vecina Neto, the former head of Brazil’s health regulator, Anvisa, called the new measures a “barbarity” that could cause more harm than good because of the dangerous potential side effects of the drug.“It has no scientific evidence,” Vecina Neto told Reuters. “(It is) unbelievable that in the 21st century, we are living off magical thinking.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-coronavirus-outbreak-worsens-as-country-could-soon-be-no-2-in-cases/story-MmgXoFrtNmodidOX19buJJ.html

In Asia they will receive either chloroquine or a placebo. A total of 25 study sites are expected to be open in the UK by the end of June, MORU said, with plans for further sites in Thailand and Southeast Asia, Italy, Portugal, Africa and South America. The results are expected by the end of this year. “We are looking at this with great care and examining all of the evidence that is out there,” Britain’s security minister James Brokenshire told Sky News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-healthcare-workers-begin-covid-19-hydroxychloroquine-trial/story-4QKJjkuuwJvbUk34nllw1I.html
21-05-2020||World||US envoy working to resuscitate flagging Afghanistan peace deal||The first visit to Kabul by Washington’s peace envoy since Afghanistan’s squabbling political leadership reached a power-sharing agreement comes amid increased violence blamed mostly on an Islamic State affiliate that has been targeted in stepped-up US bombing.Zalmay Khalilzad, in a flurry of tweets Thursday, told of his meetings in Doha earlier in the week with Taliban representatives and on Wednesday with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and fellow leader Abdullah Abdullah. All were aimed at resuscitating a US-Taliban peace deal signed in February.Khalilzad called for a reduction in violence by all sides in Afghanistan’s protracted conflict that has kept America militarily engaged for 19 years. He also said too much time has been wasted getting to the second and critical phase of the peace deal, which calls for talks between the Taliban and Afghanistan’s political leadership.Abdullah will head those efforts as part of the deal he signed with Ghani to end their monthslong dispute over who won Afghanistan’s presidential election last September. He conceded the win to Ghani but as part of a power sharing agreement.US President Donald Trump said again last week that American soldiers have wrongly been tasked with policing the country and called on Afghanistan to step up.The US has about 12,000 soldiers deployed to Afghanistan, split between counter-terrorism and the NATO-led Resolute Support’s 16,500 troop mission, which trains and aids Afghanistan’s National Security Forces. Washington currently pays about $4 billion annually to keep Afghanistan’s military in fighting form.US Department of Defense officials have told The Associated Press their biggest worry in Afghanistan is an increasingly active IS affiliate headquartered in the east. The group has ties to Middle Eastern affiliates as well as militant groups like the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and the Chinese Uighur group, East Turkestan Islamic Movement.The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject, say the IS affiliate in Afghanistan has been linked to foiled plots to attack America in recent years. The US also blamed IS for a brutal attack on a maternity hospital earlier this month in Kabul that left 24 people dead, including two infants and several mothers.The increased IS activity in Afghanistan has added urgency to US efforts to resuscitate the peace deal, which commits the Taliban to fight terrorist groups in Afghanistan. The same Department of Defense officials said they want the Taliban in the battle to rout IS from Afghanistan.Without intra-Afghan negotiations, the cease-fire Washington wants between the Taliban and the government won’t happen .Taliban representatives say a cease-fire will be on the agenda in any intra-Afghan talks, which were to start by mid-March. The delay has been blamed on Afghanistan’s squabbling leadership in Kabul and disruptions in prisoner releases, which were promised as part of the peace deal ahead of intra-Afghan negotiations.In his tweets, Khalilzad called for the prisoner release to be completed. He also reiterated he is seeking Taliban assistance with US citizens missing in Afghanistan, including US contractor Mark Frerichs who disappeared in January. Several Taliban leaders contacted by The AP said they are not holding Frerichs and have told Khalilzad repeated times.Suhail Shaheen, Taliban spokesman in Doha, said Wednesday the Taliban are committed to the deal and demanded its prisoners be released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-working-to-resuscitate-flagging-afghanistan-peace-deal/story-Xi0R91GwWAzNyJhYKJRS3L.html
21-05-2020||World||‘Fruitless and repetitive’: Iran dismisses new US sanctions||Iran dismissed on Thursday new US sanctions on several Iranian officials, saying they were a sign of the complete inefficiency of Washington’s previous sanctions on the Islamic Republic, state television reported. “Washington’s fruitless and repetitive sanctions against Iranian officials is a sign of weakness, despair and confusion of the US administration,” state TV quoted Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi as saying. The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on several Iranian authorities, including the interior minister, accusing them of engaging in serious cases of human rights abuse.The US Treasury Department said Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli gave orders authorising the Law Enforcement Forces (LEF) of Iran to use lethal force in response to anti-government protests in November, leading to the killing of protesters, including at least 23 minors. Hundreds of young and working-class Iranians took to the streets on Nov. 15 to protest against the government’s decision to increase fuel prices. The protests turned political, with demonstrators burning pictures of senior officials and calling on clerical rulers to step down. Iran’s top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, denounced the unrest as a “very dangerous conspiracy” by Iran’s enemies.An opposition website said in January that at least 631 people were killed during the unrest and London-based Amnesty International said more than 300 people had been killed. Both accounts have been dismissed by the Islamic Republic, which has yet to give a death toll. The Iranian judiciary has sentenced dozens of protesters to long terms in prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fruitless-and-repetitive-iran-dismisses-new-us-sanctions/story-ubAyg2PctkSsGxTL97U3dL.html

A critically ill Covid-19 patient will need at least six vials, he said.Bangladesh can produce generic versions of patented drugs under World Trade Organization provisions that grant least developed countries a waiver from seeking licenses. Remdesivir was cleared by U.S. drug regulator for emergency use in Covid-19 patients, becoming the first medication backed by early clinical data to be made available to fight the novel pathogen.Also Watch | US allows emergency use of antiviral drug remdesivir to treat Covid-19 patients ‘Receiving Queries’“We’re also receiving queries from other countries,” Reza said. “The drug will not be supplied through traditional distribution channels. If some governments need our drug, we’ll export it.”Bangladesh had more than 26,000 infected cases as of Wednesday, while the disease had killed 386, according to data from Johns Hopkins UniversityThe United Nations-backed Medicines Patent Pool, which is helping Gilead find partners, contacted Beximco asking if it was interested in the voluntary licensing for remdesivir, said Reza. Beximco is waiting to hear back, he said.A Gilead representative didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.Gilead has since licensed five companies including Cipla Ltd. and Mylan NV in India and Ferozsons Laboratories Ltd. in Pakistan to make generic versions of the drug and sell in 127 countries.Norway’s Norges Bank, the world’s biggest sovereign fund, controls 3% of Beximco, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

21-05-2020||World||‘Happy that I’m with her’: Australian woman reunited with dying sister||A woman has tearfully embraced her dying sister in Australia after weeks of bureaucracy wrangling over pandemic travel restrictions.Australia had rejected Christine Archer’s request for permission to fly from New Zealand four times before her story attracted media attention.Her only sister Gail Baker was diagnosed with incurable ovarian cancer in late March after both countries stopped international travel. Baker has perhaps weeks to live.Archer was eventually allowed to fly to Sydney and spent only a week in hotel quarantine before testing negative for the coronavirus. International travelers are usually quarantined for two weeks.Family friends drove the retired nurse 490 kilometers (300 miles) from Sydney to the New South Wales state coastal town of Bowraville.Archer finally hugged her younger sibling in the front yard of Baker’s home on Wednesday. It was their first reunion in six years.“Words can’t explain how I feel, to be honest.” Archer told Australian Broadcasting Corp. in an interview aired on Thursday.“I’m just so happy that I finally got to be here and be with her. The last two weeks have been the hardest or the longest two weeks of my life,” Archer said.Archer was surprised that her persistence paid off. But she is adamant that Australia made the right decision in allowing her to remain with her sister in her final days.“I wondered whether the Australian government had any compassion at all with their rejections,” Archer said.“I honestly don’t know what they were thinking. I know it’s an awful time at the moment with the virus ... but, I mean, there are some things you’ve got to be a bit lenient on and I felt this was one of them,” she said.“I didn’t think I was ever going to see Gail again. That would’ve been the worst thing in the world if that had happened,” she added.Australia’s Department of Home Affairs relented on Archer’s travel application after it allowed the New Zealand Warriors rugby league team to relocate from Auckland in preparation for the Australian football competition restarting next week.The department did not immediately respond on Thursday to a request for an explanation for the change of heart on the sisters’ reunion.New Zealand has largely succeeded in its goal of eliminating the virus. It has reported no new infections over the past four days and most of the people who contracted the virus have recovered. About 1,500 people have been reported as having the virus including 21 who died.Australia has had similar success in slowing the virus spread although New South Wales remains the worst-affected state. Australia expects New Zealand will become the first international destination with which regular passenger travel will resume because of the low risk of infection.Australia has recorded 7,079 virus cases and 100 deaths. Australia’s population is five times larger than New Zealand’s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/happy-that-i-m-with-her-australian-woman-reunited-with-dying-sister/story-ebg48enudADAVQA7xakQON.html
21-05-2020||World||Trump says his hydroxychloroquine regimen finishes in ‘day or two’||US President Donald Trump has said that the regimen of antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine that he is taking to ward off the coronavirus will finish in the next day or two.Trump disclosed on Tuesday that he was taking the drug despite medical warnings about potential serious side effects and questions about its effectiveness in preventing the coronavirus. “I think the regimen finishes in a day or two,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday when asked how long he will continue to take the antimalarial drug. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the president’s taking of the drug as a preventive measure against the coronavirus pandemic.“Hydroxychloroquine has been a drug that has been in use for 65 years for lupus, arthritis, and malaria. It has a very good safety profile. But as with any drug and as with any prescription, it should be given by a doctor to a patient in that context. So no one should be taking this without a prescription from their doctor,” she said.Henry Ford Hospital is doing a study on this now where 3,000 frontline workers will be taking hydroxychloroquine to look at its use as a prophylactic.“I believe there is a few hundred or 190 workers in Tampa General Hospital. So, this is being used by some,” she said in response to a question.McEnany said there was a lot of apoplectic coverage of hydroxychloroquine.“You had Jimmy Kimmel saying the President is, quote, ‘trying to kill himself by taking it’. You had Joe Scarborough saying, quote, ‘This will kill you’. Neil Cavuto saying, ‘What have you got to lose? One thing you have to lose are lives’. And you had Chris Cuomo saying, ‘The President knows that hydroxychloroquine is not supported by science. He knows it has been flagged by his own people and he’s using it’,” she said.“Well, Cuomo mocked the President for this. And interestingly, I found this out just before coming here that Hydroxychloroquine, of course, is an FDA-approved medication with a long-proven track record for safety. And it turns out that Chris Cuomo took a less safe version of it called quinine, which the FDA removed from the market in 2006 because of its serious side effects, including death. So, really interesting to have that criticism of the President,” McEnany said.There are several studies that have been brought up that the President has actually mentioned, she noted.There was a French study involving more than 1,000 patients that found that the vast majority had “good clinical outcomes.” And by the vast majority, that was more than 90 per cent, she said. Then there was an Italian study of more than 65,000 patients that demonstrated only 20 tested positive of those who are taking it prophylactically. And a South Korea study, as well. So there are several studies, she said.“And if you’re someone out there - and this is a safe drug to use - and your doctor - importantly to underscore that - and your doctor prescribes it for your use as a prophylaxis or after coming into contact with Covid, then it’s something you should take if it’s prescribed by the doctor and that’s your personal medical choice,” McEnany said. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate was first synthesised in 1946 and is in a class of medications historically used to treat and prevent malaria. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, childhood arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases. The drug is not FDA-approved for the treatment of Covid-19 but it has been identified as a possible treatment for the infection and the US government has requested its immediate availability.Trump has called hydroxychloroquine a “game-changer” drug in the fight against the coronavirus.After Trump’s repeated touting of hydroxychloroquine as a “game changer” cure for the virus, the FDA issued an advisory warning that the drug has not been “shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing Covid-19.” The Trump Administration has bought millions of doses of hydroxychloroquine and stockpiled it. India, which is one of the major manufactures of the drug, has sent several millions of doses to the US as part of its humanitarian gesture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-his-hydroxychloroquine-regimen-finishes-in-day-or-two/story-Mc5J9lnCdCEgLZO2gvEvRI.html
21-05-2020||World||WHO reports biggest single-day jump in global Covid-19 cases, number of infection equals New Zealand’s population||The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Wednesday reported the largest single-day increase in coronavirus cases.The WHO said that 1,06,662 virus cases reported to the UN agency on Tuesday - the most in a single day since the outbreak erupted in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December.As the global death toll topped 3,25,000 and the number of cases crossed five million, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was “very concerned” about the situation in low- and middle-income nations.More than 93,400 deaths have occurred in the United States, the hardest-hit country, according to Johns Hopkins University.The latest million took 12 days, compared to 11 days that it took for the number to go from three to four million infections. Several hard-hit countries such as Italy and Spain have crossed their peaks and are reopening slowly, but officials have cautioned against a second wave.The number of infections is now equivalent to the population of New Zealand.Data suggests that globally, the deadliest stage of the current phase may have passed. On Wednesday, the fatality rate was 14.23 per cent and the recovery rate 85.77 per cent. Such proportions were last seen before March 24.Brazil, Russia and India are emerging as the new hotspots of the disease. The US, where lockdown protocols have been less strict than most nations, added 20,289 cases on Tuesday to remain on top of the list of countries recording new cases.In less than five months since the disease was first reported - local media in China’s Wuhan wrote about a mystery respiratory illness on December 31 - much of the world has now come to terms with a new reality in which social distancing is compulsory, masks are increasingly mandatory and much of leisure activities - travelling, dining out and events such as concerts and sport - may be too dangerous till researchers find a vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-reports-biggest-single-day-jump-in-covid-19-cases-number-of-infection-equals-new-zealand-s-population/story-6DNe1tJI4Swjejqvm8bFWJ.html

The city will fulfill additional staffing requests by the end of next week, he said.Additionally, 10 “outbreak response teams” will be available to assist nursing homes and adult care facilities that are experiencing coronavirus flareups, de Blasio said.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on May 10 ordered twice-weekly testing for all staffers at nursing homes and other adult care facilities. The order doesn’t apply to residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-new-york-city-to-provide-free-tests-fill-in-staff-at-nursing-homes/story-DmDRJaZIY0bYRfmg3aKf8L.html
21-05-2020||World||‘Possibility of sanctions on India remain on table’, says top US diplomat||The possibility of US sanctions on India for buying the multi-billion dollar S-400 missile system from Russia remains on the table, a top American diplomat has said, asserting that New Delhi will have to make a strategic commitment to technologies and platforms.In October 2018, India signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, notwithstanding warning from America that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).Last year, India made the first tranche of payment of around USD 800 million to Russia for the missile systems. The S-400 is known as Russia’s most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system.“CAATSA very much remains a policy priority, certainly for Congress, where you’ve seen the very strong demand for implementation and concern over the ability of Russia to gain monies from these military sales that will be used to further undermine the sovereignty of neighbouring countries,” Alice Wells, the outgoing Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, told a Washington DC-based think tank on Wednesday.The US had imposed sanctions on Russia under the stringent CAATSA. The law also provides for punitive action against countries purchasing defence hardware from Russia.“CAATSA has not moved off the table. Instead of approaching it from a Russian prism though, I think the more important conversation to have is at this level of sophistication and as India is moving to adopt the highest level of technological systems, it really becomes a question of which system do they want to operate within,” Wells responded to a question posed by former US Ambassador to India Richard Verma.“How do they want their systems to communicate with one another? It’s not a mix and match arrangement. At certain point, India will have to make sort of a strategic commitment to technologies and platforms and we think we have the best technologies and platforms,” Wells said while participating in a Atlantic Council-organised virtual discussion.At the same time, the top US diplomat for South Asia who will retire on May 22 after a 31-year-long career, referred to the growing defense relationship between the two countries.“We have also made strides in our defense trade, with the bilateral tally now crossing the 20 billion mark after the president’s visit. I think this administration deserves to take credit for making a concerted policy change to offer India our most advanced defense technologies such as armed Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,” she said.“It’s quite remarkable to think that the same missile defense system protecting Washington DC will soon be protecting new Delhi,” Wells said.India’s growing capabilities as a first responder have also been on display in the Indian ocean where it has been delivering COVID relief, often using US-origin platforms to dozens of countries.“Looking ahead, I’m confident that defense trade and interoperability will continue to grow even though COVID-19 related budgetary challenges may slow the pace,” she noted.“One area where I think we can exert even more attention is preparing for 21st century threats, especially as the military implications of artificial intelligence, autonomous devices and quantum computing become more pronounced. I’m proud that our maturing relationship has allowed us to develop a new degree of resiliency and self-confidence and that does allow us to navigate differences on issues like trade sanctions and visas,” she said.Wells also said the US sees India as a global power and understands the country’s global interests which it seeks to protect diplomatically, politically, economically, and militarily.The US and India share a vision for an Indo-Pacific order that respects sovereignty and rule of law.“India seeks to become, you know, in the words of (External Affairs) Minister Jaishankar a leading power, but one that plays by the rules. We in turn recognise that India is successful, (its) rise contributes to an environment in Asia that serves US interests,” she said.“So, this strategic meeting of the minds on the Indo-Pacific vision has greatly enhanced how we’re able to work together, around the world. As saw in what was rebranded as the comprehensive global strategic partnership announced earlier this year during President Trump’s historic visit to India,” Wells said.Jaishankar told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in June last year that India will go by its national interest while dealing with other countries, including with sanctions-hit Russia from whom New Delhi is procuring S-400 missile defence systems. The personal rapport between President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is clear and it has clearly helped the relationship, she said. “Another example is the QUAD, which is well on its way to becoming one of the premier forums of the Indio-Pacific. In just the past year, we held the inaugural QUAD ministerial meeting. We saw QUAD ambassadors meeting regularly in countries across the Pacific and we convened experts meetings on counter terrorism, cyber issues, and maritime security,” she said.The QUAD is also playing a role in their COVID-19 coordination, Wells said.QUAD is an informal strategic dialogue between the US, Japan, Australia and India that is maintained by talks between member countries.

21-05-2020||World||At least 19 million children at imminent risk due to Cyclone Amphan, says UNICEF||At least 19 million children in parts of Bangladesh and India are at “imminent risk” from flash flooding and heavy rain as Cyclone Amphan makes landfall and the state of West Bengal is expected to take a direct hit from the powerful storm, the UN’s children agency has warned.The extremely severe cyclonic storm Amphan made a landfall at Digha in West Bengal and Bangladesh on Wednesday, leaving a trail of destruction. At least three persons were killed in India and seven in Bangladesh.The UNICEF said that at least 19 million children in parts of Bangladesh and India are at “imminent risk from flash flooding, storm surges and heavy rain as Cyclone Amphan makes landfall.” West Bengal, “home to more than 50 million people, including over 16 million children, is expected to take a direct hit from the powerful storm,” the UN agency said in a statement on Wednesday.The UNICEF said it is also very concerned that the Covid-19 could deepen the humanitarian consequences of Cyclone Amphan in both the countries. Evacuees who have moved to crowded temporary shelters would be especially vulnerable to the spread of respiratory diseases like Covid-19, as well as other infections.“We continue to monitor the situation closely,” said UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia Jean Gough.“The safety of children and their families in the areas that will be impacted is a priority and it is good to see that the authorities have planned their urgent response factoring in the on-going Covid-19 pandemic.” Across the region, the UNICEF is “working closely with the governments of Bangladesh and India and stands ready to support humanitarian operations to reach children and families affected by Cyclone Amphan.” Based on the storm’s current trajectory, Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh – now sheltering over 850,000 Rohingya refugees – is likely to experience high winds and heavy rains which may cause damage to homes and shelters in the refugee camps and Bangladeshi communities. This population is already highly vulnerable and cases of Covid-19 have recently been confirmed in the camps and host communities. The UNICEF said it is working with the Deputy Commissioner’s Office in Cox’s Bazar, the Office of the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner, and humanitarian partners to help ensure Bangladeshi and Rohingya children and families remain protected. These efforts include raising awareness among Rohingya and Bangladeshi communities on cyclone preparedness and prepositioning emergency life-saving water, sanitation, hygiene and medical supplies to meet immediate humanitarian needs. Meanwhile, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres’ spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said at the daily press briefing that UN teams on the ground continue to work with the Government of Bangladesh to prepare and support those in need in the wake of the cyclone.“Given the current pandemic, this support includes distributing personal protective equipment, disinfectants and other materials to evacuation shelters. To reduce the person-to-person contact during the delivery of aid, e-cash distributions will be used,” he said adding that the UN along with its partners is mobilising more than 1,700 mobile health teams and preparing for emergency food deliveries.“The Super Cyclone is taking a westerly trajectory towards India, but nearly 8 million people in Bangladesh remain at risk,” he said adding that the Bangladesh government has evacuated more than 2 million people in high-risk areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-19-million-children-at-imminent-risk-due-to-cyclone-amphan-says-unicef/story-nWISuVqxXikB6G1jdqQjHO.html

The median age of critically ill patients was 62 years, and two-thirds of them were male.Of the critically ill patients studied, 39 per cent had died by April 28, and 37 per cent remained hospitalised at Milstein and Allen hospitals.No critically ill patients under the age of 30 died at the two hospitals, O’Donnell said, and only a small number of them had to be put on ventilators. But more than 80 per cent of people over 80 who went on a ventilator did not survive, he said.That fact, he said, should be shared with elderly patients and their family members when trying to decide whether to use the invasive procedure to treat severe illness associated with covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.“It’s a difficult conversation, obviously,” O’Donnell said further.In the second finding, the study also said that discharge and mortality rates for the most critically ill patients have varied widely among hospital systems.Doctors told the Post that mortality rates -- which range from 50 per cent to 97 per cent in published studies -- probably reflect different regions’ demographics and the varied treatment practices in the early days of the outbreak when doctors were writing and rewriting treatment protocols on the fly almost every day.“The mortality rate [for patients on ventilators] creeps up to 70 per cent when you’re over the age of 70,” Thomas McGinn, deputy physician in chief at Northwell Health, said Tuesday, told the Lancet.“If your mom’s 85 and not well, they should know what the potential is for surviving before they have a ventilator placed,” he added.The study further appeared to confirm associations between a patient’s risk of death and markers for inflammation and coagulation in laboratory analyses of their blood samples. Doctors have been reporting in recent months that some covid-19 patients are suffering from clots that can lead to strokes or respiratory arrest.The obesity rate is among the striking features of the new research. Among critically ill patients under the age of 50 who were admitted to the hospitals, 71 per cent were obese.Harlan Krumholz, a professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine, said the Lancet study “gives a perspective on the devastating nature” of covid-19, and “should give pause to anyone who wants to dismiss SARS-CoV-2 as less than a major threat to health.”Covid cases globally surpassed 5 million on Wednesday, with Latin America overtaking the United States and Europe in the past week to report the largest portion of new daily cases globally.Latin America accounted for around a third of the 91,000 cases reported earlier this week. Europe and the United States each accounted for just over 20 per cent, representing a new phase in the virus’ spread, which initially peaked in China in February, before large-scale outbreaks followed in Europe and the United States.A large number of those new cases came from Brazil, which recently surpassed Germany, France and the United Kingdom to report the third-largest novel virus outbreak, behind the United States and Russia, across the globe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-infected-elderly-patients-on-ventilators-have-low-survival-rates-report/story-rgC5Qj43EZGmyNiYPxPUQO.html
21-05-2020||World||Health of 7.8 billion people stuck in a dangerous place between China and Trump||In mid-February, an international team of medical experts converged on Beijing to learn more about the novel coronavirus. Dispatched by the World Health Organization after delicate talks with the Chinese government about its composition and agenda, it included some of the brightest lights in epidemiology and virology, affiliated with institutions including the National Institutes of Health, the University of Hong Kong, and Germany’s national infectious-disease center. They would be accompanied by a group of Chinese scientists, and would be responsible for producing a joint report on the nature of the virus and how it was spreading within the world’s most populous country.On the first day of the trip, the non-Chinese members gathered to discuss their so-called terms of reference — the subjects they intended to learn more about as they visited hospitals and research institutions. It was Feb. 16, a little over a week after Li Wenliang, the Wuhan doctor who was reprimanded by local officials when he tried to warn colleagues that a dangerous new pathogen was on the loose, had succumbed to the virus himself. Li’s death was huge news in China, prompting an outpouring of rage on social media and wide international coverage. But whether warnings had been suppressed in Wuhan — then the virus epicenter — during the early days of the outbreak would not be part of the team’s brief. “It was not going to be helpful,” Dale Fisher, an infectious-disease specialist at the National University of Singapore who was part of the group, said in an interview. “Our mission really needed to be about collecting technical information and informing the rest of the world. The terms of reference reflected the fact that we wanted very much to look forward, not focus on the past.”While that decision undoubtedly made sense for the scientists, it was also an example of why, at a time when the WHO is trying to coordinate the response to the worst pandemic in a century, it faces an unprecedented political challenge — rooted in concerns about its relationship with China. The Trump administration ramped up its attack on the organization this week, threatening to permanently cut its funding and reconsider US membership if the WHO doesn’t enact a sweeping overhaul. While those demands look like an attempt to distract from the US’s own failures in containing the coronavirus, the White House isn’t alone in raising concerns: Australia and Canada also called for inquiries into the origins of the pandemic and the WHO’s response to it.The WHO’s international governing body this week approved plans for an independent review of the response to the pandemic, including the organization’s role. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a former Ethiopian health official and the first non-physician to hold the job, said he welcomed the scrutiny.Even as Trump threatened the WHO, President Xi Jinping of China — which has drastically expanded its influence over multilateral agencies in tandem with its economic rise — declared his support for the agency. In a speech Monday, he pledged $2 billion over two years to help fight the virus and said China would make any vaccine universally available once it’s developed.While its name might imply the WHO provides care, its key function, particularly in outbreaks, is to deliver information — learning as much as it can about what’s happening on the ground and guiding the rest of the world on how to react. But its critics question whether, in the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, that mission was compromised by excessive deference to what Beijing wanted the world to hear. If true, it would be a symptom of a larger, well-recognized issue: that the WHO has little room to maneuver without the approval of member states.There’s no question the group does an immense volume of invaluable work. Its curriculum vitae includes a long list of successes, from the virtual eradication of polio to the successful containment, in 2003, of severe acute respiratory syndrome. In the current crisis, the WHO is organizing efforts to supply developing countries with protective gear and working with partners including the European Commission to fast-track vaccine and drug development. Nor should scrutiny of its actions on Covid-19 excuse the shortcomings of countries like the US and the U.K. in preparing for the virus. But in a world that will, for the foreseeable future, be more alert than ever to the threat of infectious disease, some experts are calling for a review of the WHO’s powers and protocols.“Deference to the sovereignty of one nation can’t be allowed to put every other nation at risk,” said Thomas Bollyky, director of the global health program at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former negotiator on medical issues for the US government. “Either the WHO needs to be given additional authority and empowered to act more aggressively and proactively on outbreaks, or we’ll have to find some other entity that is set up to do that.” But options to improve the institution’s approach to controlling epidemics should be exhausted before considering anything new, he said.The WHO’s origins date nearly to the founding of the United Nations and the broader postwar order. The preamble to its 1948 constitution set out a guiding ethos: “The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being.” It continued: “The health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security.”That sweeping mission statement led the agency to take on a huge range of challenges, from promoting maternal health and birth control to immunization and aiding refugees. For most of its early history the organization’s role was largely advisory, in keeping with its legal basis: officially, the WHO is the bureaucratic arm of the World Health Assembly, a global parliament of UN members devoted to health issues. The key exception was smallpox, in which the organization played a key role in coordinating the effort to eliminate a devastating illness that had been a scourge of human populations since at least the days of ancient Egypt.Events in the 1990s, though, showed the dangers posed by newer, less-understood infections in a rapidly globalizing world. A 1995 outbreak of Ebola in Kikwit, a city in what’s now the Democratic Republic of Congo, sickened hundreds of people, ultimately killing about 80% of them. With help from the WHO and other agencies the virus was contained, but the potential for more deadly epidemics was clear, and the agency began gradually taking on a more muscular role. In 2000, it set up the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, a consortium of health institutions that would track emerging diseases. And it soon had a chance to act more aggressively. When SARS emerged in 2002 in southern China, the first reaction of the government in Beijing was to attempt a cover-up, suppressing news of the disease and refusing to inform the WHO. It only learned of the flare-up months after it began, after an emailed tip-off describing a contagious disease that had left more than 100 people dead in Guangdong Province in the space of a week.  By then, SARS was spreading in Hong Kong, moving from there to Toronto, which would eventually have the highest number of cases outside Asia.The WHO’s director-general at the time, the former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, issued what was by UN standards a scathing critique of China’s behavior, saying it would “have been definitely helpful if the international expertise and WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage.” She also issued the WHO’s first-ever travel advisories, urging the postponement of trips to parts of China as well as Toronto.SARS, which was contained largely to a few places and killed fewer than 1,000 people, ended up being a public-health success story, an example of how decisive action could prevent a novel disease from becoming an economy-shattering epidemic. But a 2005 attempt to give the WHO more robust powers — for example, to formally sanction countries that failed to report outbreaks — fell short of a true overhaul. Member states simply didn’t want to hand it that kind of tool. And if the WHO was going to continue to serve as the world’s public-health police force, it would have to do so on a shoestring. So-called assessed contributions — bills sent automatically to its members — cover less than 20% of its budget, with the rest raised on a voluntary basis from national governments and organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spend considerably more annually; so does the Cleveland Clinic.Another Ebola outbreak, the explosion of infections in West Africa that began in 2014, showed the WHO’s limitations. The virus had been raging across Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea for more than half a year when the WHO declared it a “public health emergency of international concern,” or PHEIC, its highest alert level. Margaret Chan, then the director-general, acknowledged that she had only grasped the severity of the epidemic once it was well underway — thanks to a deputy, Bruce Aylward, sending an email that urged her to make it a priority. The WHO’s response was so sluggish that World Bank President Jim Yong Kim suggested the world needed a new, dedicated disease-response corps. In the end, the most effective international response was arguably that of President Barack Obama, who mobilized the CDC and the US Agency for International Development, supported by thousands of elite troops, to help bring the virus gradually under control. More than 11,000 people died. Chan conceded that the WHO had fallen short. “We responded, but our response may not have matched the scale of the outbreak,” she told Bloomberg News at the time.At least in the early stages of the pandemic, there was nothing unprecedented about the novel coronavirus. A flu-like virus emerging in a provincial part of China and jumping to humans — possibly from bats, via another animal — is a scenario so textbook that it formed part of the plot of the film Contagion. It’s not yet clear when the virus first emerged, but as it began to take hold in Wuhan in December, China’s reaction was different from that during SARS, at least outwardly. Authorities in the city alerted the WHO on New Year’s Eve to a cluster of patients who were suffering from pneumonia of an unknown cause, and the agency activated its emergency-response capabilities the next day. “There were not weeks of central cover-up in Beijing, although local government obviously took too long to report seriously” that the disease was spreading, Brundtland said in an email. And China shared the genetic sequence of the virus on Jan. 12, allowing scientists elsewhere to develop their own tests and begin vaccine research.Read More: Behind the Global Race to Contain China’s Killer BugChina’s transparency was still far from complete. For an extended period in mid-January — coinciding with important Communist Party meetings in Wuhan — the city reported zero new cases, a level of containment that was improbable, to say the least. Government-aligned scientists and municipal officials said repeatedly that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission, even as Chinese social media buzzed with rumors that health-care workers were being infected by the mysterious new illness.On Jan. 14, Maria Van Kerkhove, one of the scientists leading the WHO response, said at a Geneva press conference that human-to-human transmission might be occurring on a limited scale, noting that such infections wouldn’t be surprising given the experience of other respiratory pathogens. But the same day, the WHO’s official Twitter account posted a message that was much less equivocal, and which has since come back to haunt the agency: “Preliminary investigations by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.”The few people from outside mainland China who were able to observe conditions in Wuhan came away skeptical about what they were being told. A pair of Taiwanese infectious-disease specialists made an official visit to Wuhan from Jan. 12 to Jan. 15, where they were briefed by local officials who said human transmission was, at worst, limited. But the fact that there were a number of cases “not related to the wet market” — the Huanan market where the first reported coronavirus cluster was identified — “showed there was more than one source, and community infection could have already happened,” said Chuang Yin-Ching, one of the pair. “These signs alerted us that we should be cautious about the situation in China. So when we came back from the trip, we suggested that we should treat the virus as if there was human infection.”No one from the WHO raised the possibility in public that China might not be providing the full picture. The organization appeared to be “uncritically passing along the information that China was putting forward when a little more distance would have been a good idea,” said J. Stephen Morrison, the director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic & International Studies.WHO officials say that behind closed doors they were pushing China to tell them more, and that many countries have struggled to present accurate data on infections and deaths — often due simply to hospitals being overwhelmed. “Our sole objective is to make sure the right decisions are taken and not that somebody is blamed or not blamed. Sometimes these discussions are very tough, but they are always respectful,” Chief of Staff Bernhard Schwartlander said in an interview. One of the successes of the agency’s approach to China, he said, was that “there were never closed doors. That’s important. For us and diplomacy, the worst is if a door closes.”When China did pivot to treating the coronavirus as a full-blown crisis, it gave the WHO little warning. On the evening of Jan. 22, after a panel of about 20 top advisers had deadlocked about whether to elevate the coronavirus to the highest alert level, a group of WHO officials was in Tedros’s office discussing what to do. Suddenly, according to a person familiar with the situation, a staff member burst in with dramatic news: China had sealed off Wuhan from the rest of the country, the first step in what eventually became a total lockdown of Hubei Province. After a follow-up meeting the next day, Tedros, the director-general, said it wasn’t yet a PHEIC, but had the potential to become one. The committee agreed to reconvene soon.Before then, Tedros had an important meeting to attend. On Jan. 28, he met Xi in Beijing, accompanied on the trip by Schwartlander and Mike Ryan, the head of the emergencies program. While they were there, the WHO received some of its first clear information indicating that the virus was being passed beyond close contacts. That news, however, came not from China but from Germany, which was beginning to observe a cluster of infections in Munich. On the plane back to Switzerland, the WHO group decided to assemble the agency’s top brass to discuss whether it was time to declare a PHEIC. Speaking to reporters after the agency made that determination on Jan. 30, Tedros heaped praise on China’s response, saying it was “beyond words,” and that he left Beijing “in absolutely no doubt about China’s commitment to transparency and to protecting the world’s people.”Didier Houssin, chair of the emergency committee, added that the WHO would closely scrutinize travel restrictions imposed by other countries — to which Xi’s government was bitterly opposed — with a view to asking them to “reconsider this decision.” The list of places doing so would soon include Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia, and New Zealand, all of which have performed well in containing the pandemic. The US, which imposed a relatively porous travel restriction around the same time, has had a very different experience.China’s commitment to transparency, however, didn’t extend to letting just anyone see its virus response up close. Getting a substantial WHO delegation into the country took more than a week of complex discussions over who would be on the team and what it would do. Schwartlander said that typically before sending a team “you need to convince a country the WHO is coming to help, not to police you. All countries are nervous in these situations.”Led by Aylward, the doctor who delivered the WHO’s Ebola warning in 2014, and Liang Wannian of China’s National Health Commission, the group spent a little over a week on the ground, visiting research facilities and hospitals and speaking to doctors, although only a small subset were permitted to travel to Wuhan. Like Tedros, they came away full of praise for how the virus was being handled. In their report, the group wrote that “China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile, and aggressive disease containment effort in history,” protecting the world in the process. In addition to lauding the efforts of health professionals and ordinary citizens, they singled out China’s paramount leader. “General Secretary Xi Jinping personally directed the prevention and control work,” the report read.Other countries no longer have to rely on the WHO to tell them about the coronavirus. They now have plenty of cases to study at home — nowhere more so than the US, where the Trump administration’s chaotic response created the conditions for the world’s deadliest outbreak. Some officials are nonetheless asking hard questions about the agency’s performance. Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, said in April that her government shares “some of the concerns the United States have identified in relation to” the WHO, and that it should be one of the subjects, rather than the organizer, of an international inquiry into the origins of the pandemic. Health Minister Greg Hunt complained that “what we saw from some officials in Geneva, we think was a response which didn’t help the world.” Canada’s foreign ministry, for its part, said there was “a critical need for a post-crisis after-action review.”  The independent evaluation of the response to the pandemic, including the WHO’s role, will be launched at “the earliest appropriate moment,” Tedros said. A resolution authorizing the review was approved this week at a meeting of the World Health Assembly.The review is unlikely to resolve tensions with the US, where the White House has made accusing the WHO of mishandling coronavirus a political priority in the run-up to November’s presidential election. It is undoubtedly an outlier — no other country has threatened to cut its WHO funding, nor attacked it in such strident terms — but, as the agency’s largest donor by far and the global hub for health research, it can hardly be ignored. “We want and need strong scientific and strategic partnerships with the US,” said the WHO’s Ryan. “We cherish that relationship.” While Democrats, including presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden, have largely defended the WHO, that position could be more difficult to sustain if an impression hardens, in Washington and the broader electorate, that it’s too close to Beijing. Tedros did himself no favors in US political circles by suggesting in an April press conference that the government of Taiwan — a bedrock American ally with a deep well of support in both parties, and which is excluded from participating in WHO activities due to Chinese pressure — had refused to disassociate itself from racist attacks against him.The WHO’s recent troubles haven’t detracted from the passionate support it enjoys in public health circles. Despite its limited budget it delivers a vast array of crucial programs, many of them in conflict zones and among the world’s poorest. Developing countries “need the WHO,” said Amadou Alpha Sall, the director of the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal. “There’s always the possibility of doing better, but in the middle of the storm they’re doing well.”Nor is it clear what a rebooted or replaced WHO would look like. Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, has proposed giving the WHO the ability to send teams of experts to investigate disease outbreaks without necessarily getting permission first, akin to how weapons inspectors operate. That idea, or related suggestions that the WHO should have the ability to levy sanctions on member states — a power enjoyed by the World Trade Organization — would undoubtedly prove the most difficult to implement. Even the governments most supportive of transforming the WHO might balk at giving it the power to override them.Schwartlander urged member states to proceed with such reforms cautiously. “It’s easy in a moment of frustration to say we need to throw all of this out and do something completely different,” he said. “But it may come at huge cost because it also may cut down on the opportunity for consensus.”Other proposed reforms are probably more attainable. Health experts have long complained about the agency’s practice of appointing regional heads by secret ballots among member states, arguing this can make them too beholden to the governments that elected them. It might also be possible to revamp the WHO budget to make it less dependent on voluntary contributions, providing more certainty about future resources.Still, countries looking for a revamped WHO — by itself — to save them from the impact of the next pandemic may be looking in the wrong place. In the still-evolving coronavirus crisis, the US, along with dozens of other governments, could in retrospect have acted faster or more decisively.Seeking scapegoats, whether in Geneva or China, is missing the point, said Marie-Paule Kieny, a former WHO official and now a research director at Inserm, a French health-science institute. “How long did it take the US government to see, to understand, and to report that there was a problem?” she asked. “The Chinese government messed up in the early weeks,” but since then “they have shared enormously, and unfortunately the other countries didn’t take this seriously, because they didn’t think it would come to them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-of-7-8-billion-people-stuck-in-a-dangerous-place-between-china-and-trump/story-ar18XWUMbqZ4GJNoxlUhNN.html
21-05-2020||World||China focused on jobs as national legislature meets||As job losses surge, China is joining the United States and other governments in rolling out stimulus spending to revive its virus-battered economy.How much is Beijing ready to spend? Companies and the public are looking to the meeting of the ceremonial national legislature starting Friday for details. One closely watched indicator: Whether Beijing will skip for the first time setting an economic growth target given uncertainties over what lies ahead.China, where the coronavirus pandemic began in December, was the first economy to start reopening in March. But while the United States, Japan and Europe launched or debated plans for a flood of spending to shore up economic activity, the ruling Communist Party held back and focused instead on reopening factories.Now, facing a politically perilous wave of tens of millions of jobs lost, President Xi Jinping’s government is promising to prop up employment to support the economy’s main growth engine — consumer spending.“We see huge unemployment pressure, and we need to see sizable stimulus to keep people employed,” said Citigroup economist Li-Gang Liu.Adding to that pressure is the re-escalation of a tariff war with Washington over Beijing’s technology ambitions and trade surplus. The two sides signed a truce in January but President Donald Trump says he might back out if China doesn’t buy more American farm products and other exports.The gathering of the 3,000-plus delegates to the ceremonial National People’s Congress, delayed from March, is the year’s highest-profile political event but does little lawmaking work. Instead, Chinese leaders use the meeting to showcase policy decisions already made by the ruling party about health, education, aid to farmers and other issues.The focus when Premier Li Keqiang announces annual spending plans on Friday will be on jobs after the economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter, its worst performance since at least the mid-1960s.Fitch Ratings estimates as many as 30% of China’s 442 million urban workers — or more than 130 million people — lost their jobs at least temporarily. Citigroup says as many as 25 million jobs might disappear for good this year.Tian Zhanhua, a migrant worker from Hebei province, lost his position as a salesman for a printing company in Beijing.Tian earned as much as 8,000 yuan ($1,100) per month before the outbreak. Now, he goes to a labor market looking for odd jobs that pay 150 to 300 yuan ($21 to $42) a day.“Before the epidemic, I could work two jobs at the same time, but now I can’t find one,” said Tian, who lives in a 6 square meter (60 square foot) room. “I’m living on the brink of starvation.”Finance Minister Liu Kun raised expectations by promising to “ensure employment” with an “active fiscal policy” in a May 14 commentary in the ruling party newspaper People’s Daily.Beijing needs to “firmly guarantee the bottom line” of wages, Liu wrote, giving no details of spending plans.The government could hire more teachers and create low-level jobs in hospitals and other public services, said Citigroup’s Liu, but it can create a limited number of jobs on its own and needs the private sector to soak up most of the unemployed. That includes 9 million new university graduates due to enter the workforce this year.The government is probably “very much concerned,” said Liu.China can afford to borrow and spend if needed because its central government debt is low compared with other major countries. But its leaders have other reasons to move cautiously.Total debt, including borrowing by companies and households, soared so high over the past decade that international rating agencies cut Beijing’s credit rating for government borrowing in 2018. Banks that lent to finance stimulus spending after the 2008 global crisis have a mountain of nonperforming loans.Throwing around too much money also might fuel inflation, which is near a seven-year high after an epidemic of African swine fever disrupted pork supplies last year, causing food costs to spike. That is especially sensitive in a society where the poorest families spend up to half their incomes to feed themselves.So forecasters expect Chinese spending to come in well below the $3 trillion package being debated by the U.S. Congress or Japan’s $1.1 trillion plan.The party’s ultimate goal is to persuade consumers — millions of whom have lost jobs or worry they might — to spend again.City governments have handed out discount vouchers to lure consumers back to restaurants and shopping malls. Despite that, spending in April fell 7.5% from a year earlier while factory output rose 3.9%.The outlook is so uncertain that some economists say Beijing should skip setting a target for economic growth.That target — at least 6% in previous years — has become politically sensitive as growth slowed from the previous decade’s explosive double-digit rates.This year, why pick a target when even 4% looks out of reach and so little is known about what will happen to China’s trading partners, Ma Jun, an adviser to the central bank, told the state newspaper Economic Daily.Private sector forecasts range from no growth to under 3%.“The final economic impact will be mainly determined by the development of the epidemic in Europe and the United States,” Ma said.Still, Citigroup’s Liu argues Beijing needs to set a target, even a low one, to motivate local officials to promote business development.Without a target, “they don’t have to try hard,” said Liu. “But the result could be huge unemployment and social instability.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-focused-on-jobs-as-national-legislature-meets/story-oOH0kxYOF92hxkVxGB2h9N.html

21-05-2020||World||In Washington, signs of Covid-19 lockdown fraying||Rico Montego, 22, is out and about in Washington on his daily routine, chatting with friends on a street corner in the east of the city, despite the strict stay-at-home orders.Compliance with the lockdown -- now in its eighth week -- has been patchy across the American capital, with concern focused on casual social gatherings in neighborhoods hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic.Montego lives in Trinidad, a small, ethnically-mixed residential area that has recorded over 230 cases of coronavirus, among the highest per capita in the city.According to official data, 77 percent of the 407 deaths in Washington have been black, revealing the disproportionate toll on African-Americans as only about 46 percent of residents are black.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“It is very difficult to stay home all day with nothing to do,” said Montego.“I was working for a big security company until they stopped our shifts. They say we will go back, but I have no money coming in.“I haven’t got my stimulus check -- the system is all backed up. We are just waiting around.”A few blocks away, Barry Wright, 61, and about eight other men gathered on a sidewalk to eat lunch distributed by a local school.“We are here every day. We all grew up nearby,” he said.The group are theoretically breaking the city’s lockdown rules, and could face $5,000 fines or even 90 days in jail, but Wright said the police don’t interfere.“They know us and stop to chat, asking us if we’re OK and giving us water bottles,” he said.Unequal cityAs the United States battles to quell the pandemic that claimed more than 93,000 deaths nationwide so far, the impact has underlined Washington’s sharp social and economic disparities.The capital has boomed in recent years, but poverty, unemployment and inadequate public services remain widespread in some of its black-majority neighborhoods.Experts say African-Americans are suffering more from Covid-19 due to higher housing density, poor health and medical care, and more often having to take public transport to work.“This is overwhelming for a lot of people. All we can do is follow the guidance on staying under lockdown,” said Brian Hamilton, pastor of the Westminster Presbyterian Church in the city’s southwest.“But many people are getting close together, many are not social distancing, and some young men don’t want to wear masks.“Some just don’t have masks, others just won’t do it. Groups hang around -- it does happen a lot.”Deaths from coronavirus have plateaued in recent weeks in Washington, rather than fallen as they have in former hotspots such as New York and New Orleans.City authorities could be facing a long battle, but they may soon follow other parts of the US by easing the lockdown.Mayor Muriel Bowser said she could unveil a phased reopening plan this week despite the emergency stay-at-home order being extended to June 8.Recent warm spring weekends have encouraged some residents to venture outside to socialize, with some skate parks attracting large crowds, and the upcoming Memorial Day holiday is set to further test the restrictions.Rhonda Hamilton, 43, is an advisory neighborhood commissioner -- an elected local volunteer -- who represents about 2,000 people in the Buzzard Point district next to the Anacostia River.“People say ‘we saw six or seven young people together’ but I say those youngsters are like a family -- always together and drawing strength from their own peer group.“A lot of African-American culture is based on people connecting, so people continue to check on one another, to have conversations, to make sure meals are distributed,” Hamilton said.“Social distancing has changed how we reach out to each other but, even in the midst of the pandemic, those cultural relationships and community connections continue.“This has been a total readjustment of how we live.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-washington-signs-of-covid-19-lockdown-fraying/story-UMrQONjM7mVeRftNvNna6I.html

They say there should be system of working for 30 days and then living under lockdown for another 50 days.This cycle is the only way we can get break the chain of infection, the scientists said. They want this arrangement to be in place till 2022.The scientists have based their results on data from 16 countries. The study has been reported by Hindustan Times’ Hindi language publication Hindustan.The study has been conducted by a group of scientists at the Cambridge University and published in the European Joruanl of Epidemology. Dr Rajiv Chaudhary, who led the research, said that following this routine will help save jobs. It will also help in mitigating financial instability and social interruption.The researchers, however, say that testing, contact tracing and isolation should continue.The researchers have presented three potential scenarios to back their claim. The first, as suggested by these scientists, will help in reducing the spread of the infection. And it will end the pandemic in 18 days, the researchers have claimed. The second scenario talks about taking no steps at all. This will lead to death of 78 lakh people and the pandemic ill last for 200 days.The third scenario presented by the researchers talks about giving relaxations during the lockdown for 50 days and then opening up for 30 days. This, they say, will lead to increase in cases going to the intensive care and result in death of 35 lakh people.The number of Covid-19 cases crossed five million on Wednesday as the pandemic continued to devastate the globe where close to 3,25,000 people have now died due to it and millions more find themselves unemployed and at the risk of poverty.The latest million took 12 days, compared to 11 days that it took for the number to go from three to four million infections. Several hard-hit countries such as Italy and Spain have crossed their peaks and are reopening slowly, but officials have cautioned against a second wave.The number of infections is now equivalent to the population of New Zealand.Brazil, Russia and India are emerging as the new hot spots while the US remains on top of the list of countries adding new cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/50-day-lockdown-relaxation-for-30-days-british-scientists-suggest-new-model-to-beat-covid-19/story-Gv4sUc4rkMGALcJyCGi1nJ.html
21-05-2020||World||Trump threatens funds for states easing voting in pandemic||President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to hold up federal funds for two election battleground states that are trying to make it easier and safer to vote during the coronavirus pandemic. He backed away from that threat but stuck with his unsupported claim that widespread voting by mail promotes “a lot of illegality.”The president targeted Michigan with a false tweet on its voting plans and also went after Nevada in the latest — and the most confused — episode in his campaign against voting by mail. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends it as a safe option during the pandemic.Trump has said repeatedly, without evidence, that mailed ballots allow widespread fraud and has worried publicly that wide availability could lead so many people to vote that Republicans would lose in November. GOP allies have fought changes to voting in court and opposed funding to expand mail-in voting in Congress.Wednesday marked the first time Trump has tried to use federal aid money to beat it back.Trump began by going after Michigan, misstating Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s announcement that she would send applications for absentee ballots to every voter in the state. Though Republican secretaries of state have taken this step elsewhere, Trump pounced on the move in a state key to his reelection hopes.“Michigan sends absentee ballots to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election,” Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. That brought strong criticism from Democrats in Michigan and elsewhere, pointing out that the state was sending applications, not actual ballots, an error the president corrected in a subsequent tweet six hours later. He stuck with the rest of his tweet: “This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!”Trump later tweeted a similar threat to pull back funds from Nevada, which has sent ballots to voters for its June 9 state primary. A federal judge recently cleared Nevada’s decision to mail ballots, which were sent by the Republican secretary of state.It was not clear exactly what funds Trump was referencing, but the states are paying for the voting changes with federal aid intended to support elections during the pandemic. By Wednesday evening, Trump told reporters he had spoken with Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and did not think funding would have to be cut.“I don’t think it’s going to be necessary,” he said, adding that he stood by his opposition to mail voting. “Voting is an honor. It shouldn’t be something where they send you a pile of stuff and you send it back.”“If people mail in ballots, there’s a lot of illegality,” he said at the White House.Trump himself has requested an absentee ballot to vote in Florida.Trump did not threaten Republican-dominated states that are doing the same thing as Michigan. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, an ally of the president, said he’s not concerned about Trump’s threats even though his administration approved mailing absentee ballot applications to all registered voters in the state.“I can’t imagine that the president is going to withhold funding in any way to West Virginia; that’s not going to happen,” Justice told reporters.Trump’s tweets and statements came the day before he is slated to visit Michigan to tour Ford’s ventilator assembly plant in Ypsilanti. The state is one of three Rust Belt states that helped deliver his 2016 victory. In recent months, it has become a national hot spot for the coronavirus and watched its economy collapse, both factors contributing to what T rump’s advisers see as a shift toward Democrats.The president’s comments appeared to reflect growing GOP concerns that Democrats’ swift embrace of mail-in voting will give them an edge in November. Some key Democratic areas have moved to make it easier for voters to request ballots, while Republican areas have not. And even though Trump’s campaign encourages absentee voting, along with several state Republican Party officials, GOP voters, like Trump, have expressed growing skepticism.On Monday, before Trump’s Twitter threat, the Republican National Committee sought to clarify its position on vote by mail, arguing that the party opposes mailing ballots to every voter, as Nevada has done, but does not oppose mailing applications, as Michigan did.“I don’t really have an issue with absentee requests forms being sent to voters,” RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel said.On Wednesday, Trump’s threats scrambled that distinction.Republicans’ claims that mailing ballots to all voters creates widespread fraud is not backed up by evidence from the five states that use this method. None has had significant voter fraud cases. Trump himself has voted absentee in previous elections.The White House referred questions about the president’s tweets to Trump’s reelection campaign. Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh asserted “there is no statutory authority for the secretary of state in Michigan to send absentee ballot applications to all voters” — an argument some Michigan Republicans have also made. Murtaugh did not address whether Republican secretaries of state elsewhere were similarly constrained.The GOP-controlled U.S. Senate has so far stopped Democrats from mandating expanded mail and early voting as part of coronavirus relief bills, arguing that states should make decisions on their own election systems. The battle has largely moved to the courts, with Democrats filing at least 17 lawsuits to force states to expand their programs.Hours after Trump tweeted Wednesday, he sent another message to Michigan. The state is grappling with severe flooding in one county after two dams failed, forcing thousands to evacuate.Three hours after threatening to hold up federal funding to the state, Trump tweeted: “My team is closely monitoring the flooding in Central Michigan – Stay SAFE and listen to local officials. Our brave First Responders are once again stepping up to serve their fellow citizens, THANK YOU!”___Riccardi reported from Denver. Associated Press writers David Eggert in Lansing, Mich., and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-threatens-funds-for-states-easing-voting-in-pandemic/story-cIPKNz7s5qrjLXUdBiaVoO.html
21-05-2020||World||‘It all comes from the top’: Trump sharpens attack on China on Covid-19||US President Donald Trump lashed out at China again for the coronavirus crisis, accusing Beijing of trying to deflect the pain and carnage that their country spread throughout the world.“Spokesman speaks stupidly on behalf of China, trying desperately to deflect the pain and carnage that their country spread throughout the world. Its disinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe is a disgrace. It all comes from the top. They could have easily stopped the plague, but they didn’t!” Trump said on Twitter. ....It all comes from the top. They could have easily stopped the plague, but they didn’t!He also took a swipe at his rival in the November presidential election, Joe Biden.“China is on a massive disinformation campaign because they are desperate to have Sleepy Joe Biden win the presidential race so they can continue to rip-off the United States, as they have done for decades, until I came along!” he said in another tweet.Last week, Trump had said that he was very disappointed in China over its failure to contain the novel coronavirus, saying the worldwide pandemic cast a pall over his US-China trade deal.“They should have never let this happen. So I make a great trade deal and now I say this doesn’t feel the same to me. The ink was barely dry and the plague came over. And it doesn’t feel the same to me,” Trump said in an interview.Trump has been targeting China for spreading the virus. Earlier this month, Trump was asked at a press conference if he had seen evidence that gave him a “high degree of confidence” that the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and replied that he had, although he declined to give specifics.The Chinese state-backed institute has, however, dismissed allegations that the virus originated there. Most experts believe the virus originated in a Wuhan market selling wildlife and jumped from animals to people.A crucial meeting of the World Health organisation (WHO) last week discussed a resolution backed by more than 100 countries that sought probe into the source of the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-all-comes-from-the-top-trump-sharpens-attack-on-china-on-covid-19/story-kQ9QBV58y3jCMFHN0EZ4QO.html
21-05-2020||World||Australia backs technology in new carbon emissions plan||Australia’s conservative government on Thursday released a fresh plan to tackle climate change, targetting the use of gas, hydrogen, batteries and carbon capture, while avoiding the contentious issue of setting a carbon price.Australia, one of the world’s biggest carbon emitters per capita, has struggled for more than a decade to formulate a long-term plan for a low carbon economy amid a politically charged debate between fossil fuel supporters and opponents.The latest proposal, which the government aims to turn into formal policy by September, is based on driving down energy storage costs to back up wind and solar power, electrifying industrial processes and scaling up hydrogen production.“At its core, this is about technology not taxes. It means reducing emissions, not reducing jobs and the economy,” Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor said in a statement.Green groups, however, oppose the plan for its continued reliance on fossil fuels, like gas and coal. They, along with mining, energy and other big corporations, have argued for the introduction of a price on carbon to drive green investment.The government, which sees gas- and coal-fired power as needed in the medium term to help back up renewables, is looking to take advantage of Australia’s abundant supply of natural gas.It also wants to develop an electric vehicle strategy, slash the cost of producing hydrogen and find ways to bring down the costs of carbon capture and storage (CCS), which opponents say is an unproven and expensive technology.The so-called technology roadmap is designed to help Australia meet its Paris Climate Accord commitment to cut carbon emissions by between 26% and 28% from 2005 levels by 2030.The oil and gas industry, big energy users and the Clean Energy Council welcomed the proposals, while anti-fossil fuel advocates said the plan was misguided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-backs-technology-in-new-carbon-emissions-plan/story-SFgepSiHf1tzCMZlWqZaEO.html

21-05-2020||World||Graduation ceremonies draw thousands across US despite Covid-19 fears||High schools nationwide have canceled or postponed traditional graduation ceremonies to avoid worsening the spread of the new coronavirus, but some plunged ahead with full-fledged springtime commencement exercises as usual, with tweaks to account for health concerns.Thousands of graduates, parents, siblings and grandparents were invited to a nearly 11,000-seat stadium on Wednesday and Thursday nights in the Birmingham suburb of Hoover, where two high schools — among the largest in Alabama — were organizing traditional commencement exercises despite Covid-19.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageTwo schools in nearby cities held their ceremonies Tuesday, with chairs for more than 540 graduates spread apart across a football field at Thompson High and a keynote address by the state school superintendent. Few wore protective face masks, and seniors hugged and gathered in tight groups for pictures.Dr. Michael Saag, who treats infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said the coronavirus poses too great a risk for such ceremonies since virus carriers without symptoms could unknowingly infect others.Saag himself became infected in March.“Having had this before, even if you survive it, which most people do, it’s still a pretty harrowing thing to go through,” said Saag, now back at work.School officials in Hoover announced the ceremonies in the city’s open-air baseball stadium, after Gov. Kay Ivey had ended state restrictions on the size of group gatherings, as long as people from different households stay 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.Hundreds of chairs for graduates were spread across the dirt infield with spectators assigned seats on metal bleachers and in blue stadium seats. Red tape blocked seats to be avoided.Kathy Murphy, the city school superintendent, said the ceremonies will comply with the rules.“All of our students will be celebrated, even those who choose not to come, and we understand that. But we will call their names,” Murphy said in a video posted online.Since Gov. Kay Ivey eased restrictions in recent weeks, cases have risen in parts of Alabama including the capital city, health officials say.Statewide, Alabama has added as many as 350 new cases per day in the past two weeks, and the state’s average number of new cases has continued to climb. It’s unclear how much of the rise is due to increased testing or increased disease. And there are large numbers of Covid-19 patients hospitalized in Montgomery and Mobile, two other major Alabama cities.Schools in California planned virtual graduations after traditional events were canceled, and students at an Illinois school walked across a stage in an otherwise empty auditorium. Some systems delayed ceremonies until summer or split graduating classes into smaller groups for live ceremonies. Former President Barack Obama recorded a video graduation speech for seniors.But Spain Park and Hoover are two of Alabama’s largest, top-ranked state schools. Both are in a heavily populated area, drawing criticism from those who called the ceremonies risky.As a precaution, the graduates are being given face masks and told not to hug friends, exchange high fives or linger afterward. Tickets are limited to four per student, and all present must wear face coverings. Still, the numbers of potential attendees are daunting at a time when sporting events, concerts, and movies are still prohibited because of crowd concerns.Some 390 seniors graduated Wednesday night from Spain Park. Everyone had a mask on while entering the stadium though a few in the audience removed theirs once seated and the ceremony started. The event began orderly with ushers directing family groups to seats at least one row and more than six feet (1.8 meters) apart.The Spain Park graduates, in their black robes and masks, spread out in chairs across the baseball infield. Besides the nearly 400 students, faculty and administrators onfield, there were easily more than 1,500 people in the stands.Another 690 will graduate Thursday from Hoover High, so some 3,450 people could be inside Hoover Metropolitan Stadium.Critics say that even with the rules, huge ceremonies could hasten more coronavirus transmission in metro Birmingham, home to more than 1 million. The city of Hoover, with 85,000 residents, sits astride two counties that have more than 1,770 virus cases combined.Bonnie Kaiser, a 2004 Hoover High graduate who teaches in the Department of Anthropology and Global Health Program at the University of California-San Diego, was among 31 health professionals and system alumni who signed an open letter urging officials to reconsider the ceremonies.“I think the thing is there’s not a way to do it safely even if everyone has perfect behavior ... and we know at a graduation that just will not happen,” Kaiser said.But parents pleased their children could have a traditional graduation flooded the school’s social media feeds with thanks to school officials. Still, some top-ranked students said they were skipping the celebrations.Omar Mohammad, a 17-year-old Spain Park senior, organized a protest Saturday outside the graduation site with a few dozen supporters. He called the ceremony “unsafe and irresponsible.”“All it takes is one asymptomatic person,” Mohammad said. “This isn’t about graduation ... If you get a disease you can spread it.”Murphy, the city superintendent, emphasized the ceremonies are optional.South of Hoover in Alabaster, Thompson High School held a traditional graduation ceremony in its football stadium Tuesday night, limiting it to 2,500 guests, or roughly half the normal capacity, but with no masks required. Senior Jael Janae Johnson thanked God for the event in the opening prayer.“This wouldn’t be possible without your will,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/graduation-ceremonies-draw-thousands-across-us-despite-covid-19-fears/story-i3XLnqqMQWnPykP7FbkeGO.html
21-05-2020||World||WTO to open nominations for next director on June 8||Candidates to succeed Roberto Azevedo as head of the WTO will have one month from June 8 to submit their nominations, the global trade body said following the Brazilian’s surprise resignation.After July 8, candidates will be invited to meet with WTO members, the World Trade Organization said in a statement Wednesday after a decision by its 164 members.The Brazilian last week announced he will step down on August 31, a year before his term ends, despite the Covid-19 pandemic ravaging the global economy.Azevedo said it had been a “personal decision” reached with his family, and stressed that he was not leaving to pursue “political opportunities”.His abrupt departure leaves WTO members with less than three months to appoint a successor, a process which usually takes nine months.Many observers are betting on a candidate from Africa -- and against a WTO insider.Azevedo’s departure comes at a bad time with the WTO already in crisis before the pandemic hit, dealing with raging trade wars and scathing criticism by the United States under President Donald Trump, who has pushed for reforms of the Geneva-based body.The procedure for appointing the director-general of the WTO is not an election but a process of elimination carried out in consultation with members.Azevedo, who in 2013 succeeded Frenchman Pascal Lamy, was selected after three elimination stages.On Azevedo’s watch, WTO members concluded their first-ever multilateral agreement when they reached a deal in Bali in late 2013 on overhauling global customs procedures.But since his second term began in 2017, countries have failed to reach further multilateral agreements, and the WTO has struggled to deal with a US administration openly hostile to its multilateral approach.The WTO was also forced to put its dispute settlement appeal system on ice last December after Washington blocked the appointment of new judges, preventing it from reaching a three-judge quorum.apo/lpt/mtp/jah||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wto-to-open-nominations-for-next-director-on-june-8/story-637UxCi6afAT7SCtk2kAAP.html
21-05-2020||World||Mexico City will begin gradual reopening June 1, says Mayor||Even as Mexico saw its largest one-day death toll, Mexico City announced Wednesday it will begin a gradual reopening June 1.The nationwide death toll rose by 424 on Wednesday to 6,090, well above last week’s record of 353 deaths reported in one day. Total confirmed infections nationwide grew to 56,594, though the real number is probably several times higher because Mexico performs so little testing.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageWith about 9 million residents, the capital is one of the world’s largest cities. Authorities predicted the pandemic is nearing its peak in Mexico City, but hospitals in the capital are already about three-quarters full. As of Tuesday night, Mexico City reported more than 15,000 confirmed coronavirus infections and nearly 1,500 deaths.Despite it all, Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico City will begin a gradual reopening June 1, when some sectors of the economy would be allowed to resume operations.While Sheinbaum called on residents to continue taking social distancing measures through June 15, impatience with being shut up at home, household financial demands and a lack of any enforcement already drew more and more people back into the streets in recent weeks.More customers clustered at the city’s famous street food stands and traffic has picked up. The city never shut down its subway system, which millions depend on for transportation.Sheinbaum’s reopening plan included some of the industries that the federal government already approved to return to work like construction, but also adds bicycle sales and beer production.The mayor said bike shops are being exempted because she wants to promote bicycle use as a way to help improve the health of city residents. As elsewhere around the world, Mexico’s Covid-19 dead have included a high percentage of people suffering from ailments such as diabetes and obesity.Some businesses never shut down in the city, but did implement social distancing measures. At an office goods store in a central neighborhood Wednesday, a dozen people lined up in the parking lot outside. A security guard with a mask and bottle of hand sanitizer let customers enter one at a time only when an employee was available to escort them and after a squirt of gel on their hands.Sheinbaum has acknowledged that the real number of deaths in Mexico City is surely higher, but says an independent panel will have to review suspected cases and make a determination. City death records reported by an anti-corruption watchdog group suggested the death toll could be three times as high in the capital.The city’s graduated reopening will be based on its hospital occupancy, which currently stands at 76%.“The trend continues increasing, but we hope this trend will decrease in the coming weeks,” Sheinbaum said.The rest of the city’s economic activity won’t be allowed to resume until hospital occupancy drops below 59%. Even then, restaurants, hotels and churches will be limited to 30% of their capacity.Sports are to resume without fans. But in professional soccer, Mexico’s most popular sport that has been shut down since March 15, club owners are still debating whether to restart their season or just call it off.Fanny Alejandra Manriquez Ezquivel, a city employee who has continued working and not quarantined at home, said Wednesday that she thinks it is time for the city to return to some semblance of normality.“Sooner or later we’re all going to get infected and you’ve got to return to normalcy,” Manriquez said. “They’re the ones who know and have the certainty of how to manage the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mayor-says-mexico-city-will-begin-gradual-reopening-june-1/story-yNOtuXw4K2TuMUBO0Qt9cM.html

China routinely denounces US arms sales to Taiwan.The US State Department has approved a possible sale to Taiwan of 18 MK-48 Mod6 Advanced Technology Heavy Weight Torpedoes and related equipment for an estimated cost of $180 million, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement on Wednesday.“The Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of this possible sale today,” it added.The proposed sale serves US national, economic, and security interests by supporting Taiwan’s “continuing efforts to modernise its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability”, the agency said.The announcement came on the same day Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen was sworn in for her second term in office, saying she strongly rejecting China’s sovereignty claims. China responded that “reunification” was inevitable and that it would never tolerate Taiwan’s independence.China has stepped up its military drills near Taiwan since Tsai’s re-election, flying fighter jets into the island’s air space and sailing warships around Taiwan.China views Tsai as a separatist bent on formal independence for Taiwan. Tsai says Taiwan is an independent state called the Republic of China, its official name, and does not want to be part of the People’s Republic of China governed by Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-sell-taiwan-torpedoes-worth-180-million/story-4MUl6I167ft0mtxQrd8AHP.html
21-05-2020||World||New Zealand opens bars as more curbs eased, four-day work week idea floated||Bars and pubs opened in New Zealand for the first time in months on Thursday, as restrictions to limit the spread of the coronavirus were eased further and the government looked to revive economic activity.Venues serving alcohol have remained closed across the country despite most other businesses re-opening last week. The government said they posed additional risks, citing South Korea where a fresh spike in cases was blamed on crowded nightclubs in Seoul.“We’re nervously excited, we’ve been closed for a really long time, which hurts,” Matt McLaughlin, a pub owner and a member of industry group Hospitality New Zealand told 1News.“But, you know, we’re in hospitality. We love our punters, we love our people; we’re excited to get the doors open and get some bums on seats hopefully.”The hospitality and tourism sectors were worst hit by the pandemic, as New Zealand enforced some of the tightest social restrictions in the world to stop the spread of the coronavirus.The measures helped limit infections to just over 1,500 people and 21 deaths, far fewer than many other countries.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s government faces a tough task rebooting the $200 billion economy, with growth expected to slow significantly and hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.The government announced a NZ$50 billion package last week, which included billions on infrastructure, healthcare, housing and wage subsidy schemes.With international travel still banned, Ardern has encouraged businesses to consider allowing a four-day work week so New Zealanders can travel around the country to help the battered tourism industry.“Ultimately, that really sits between employers and employees,” Ardern said, highlighting the increased workplace flexibility the pandemic has led to.“Think about whether that is something that would work for your workplace, because it certainly would help tourism all around the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-opens-bars-as-more-curbs-eased-four-day-work-week-idea-floated/story-g8OrC6Jxi4zrujbyuKVfmI.html
21-05-2020||World||Global coronavirus cases cross 5 million in less than 5 months||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases crossed the 5-million mark on Wednesday, according to a compilation of figures by Worldometer, as the pandemic continued to devastate the globe where close to 325,000 people have now died due to it and millions more find themselves unemployed and at the risk of poverty.The latest million took 12 days, compared to 11 days that it took for the number to go from three to four million infections. Several countries, particularly the ones that were the hardest hit in early April such as Italy and Spain, have crossed their peaks and are reopening slowly, but officials have warned of a second wave that it may lead to. The total number of infections is now equivalent to the population of New Zealand.Also on Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) expressed concern about the rising number of new coronavirus cases in poor countries, even as many rich nations have begun emerging from lockdown.The global health body said 106,000 new cases of infections of the coronavirus had been recorded in the past 24 hours, the most in a single day since the outbreak began.“We still have a long way to go in this pandemic,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference. “We are very concerned about rising cases in low and middle income countries.”Data of fatality and recovery rates on Worldometer suggests that globally, the deadliest stage of the current phase may have passed. On Wednesday, the fatality rate was 14.23% and the recovery rate was 85.77%. Such low proportion of deaths and high proportion of recoveries were last seen before March 24.Brazil, Russia and India are emerging as the new hot spots of the disease. The US, where lockdown protocols have been less strict than most nations, added 20,289 cases on Tuesday to remain on top of the list of countries recording new cases. In less than five months since the disease was first reported - local media in China’s Wuhan wrote about a mystery respiratory illness on December 31 - much of the world has now come to terms with a new reality in which social distancing is compulsory, masks are increasingly mandatory and much of leisure activities - travelling, dining out and events such as concerts and sport - may be too dangerous till researchers find a vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-infects-5-million-worldwide/story-vTtLwmOCBW8dMRQbrlulMI.html
