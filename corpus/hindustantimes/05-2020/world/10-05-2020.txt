The British Beer & Pub Association says 40% of 47,000 pubs will not survive beyond September without government support.They include a large number of ‘desi pubs’ that combine the traditions of the British pub with Indian food and music, such as Bollywood songs and live ‘bhangra’ performances, particularly in parts of London, Leicester, Birmingham and the west Midlands.Ministers have indicated that pubs and restaurants would be the last to re-open, not at least until the end of August. Some pubs have diversified into delivering drinks to homes, but since there is no ban on selling liquor in shops, such sales are small.Emma McClarkin of the British Beer & Pub Association, says: “Nearly half of the UK’s pubs could close unless the government does more to help them. For the sake of communities and jobs across the UK – as well as the very institution of the great British pub – the government cannot allow that to happen”.“Nearly 19,000 pubs are at risk and 320,000 jobs too…Our ask to the government is clear, recognise the real jeopardy facing the great British pub and act now to save it, or risk losing many locals and their communities”, she adds.Industry estimates say even before the lockdown, the pubs’ historic role as a convivial place to meet, socialise and more faced challenge from the proliferation of coffee shops and restaurants. There were around 60,000 pubs in 2000; now the figure is 47,000.Some insist this reflects a progressive loss of the British way of life, and hark to novelist George Orwell’s famous 1946 essay, The Moon Under Water, that described the perfect pub: Victorian fittings, cast-iron fireplaces, food, garden, and charming family-friendly places.Calling for a 12-month business rates holiday to deal with the effect of the pandemic, Ruth Sloan of Campaign for Real Ale, the consumer group representing beer drinkers and pub goers, says: “When all this is over, many of us are looking forward to getting down to the pub for a pint with friends and family”.“Pubs are a vital part of our social fabric, helping to tackle loneliness and social isolation, providing a place for communities to meet and offering a supervised setting for responsible drinking”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-pubs-in-crisis-as-large-beer-stocks-go-waste-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-HZjLdm5Y2y9vg8qA4GbZgI.html

Salve also said Pakistan has not complied with the court’s ruling to stay Jadhav’s execution and review his conviction.Foreign Office spokesperson Aisha Farooqui responded on Sunday by saying Pakistan rejects the “baseless and inaccurate” remarks by Salve. She said in a statement that Pakistan has “fully complied” with the ICJ’s judgement. “We firmly reject the Indian counsel’s baseless and inaccurate assertion that Pakistan has not complied with the ICJ’s judgment in the case. Pakistan has fully complied with the judgment and remains committed to continue doing so as the case proceeds further,” she said.“Pakistan has granted India consular access to commander Jadhav and is processing measures for effective review and reconsideration as per the guidelines provided by ICJ in its judgment,” she added.Farooqui said it was “regrettable” that Salve made statements which misrepresent facts”, adding Pakistan had abided by “all its international obligations”.There was no immediate response to Farooqui’s remarks from Indian officials.Jadhav was arrested by Pakistani security agencies in Balochistan in March 2016 and charged with involvement in spying. In April 2017, Pakistan announced he had been given the death sentence by a military court. Salve had also said during the online lection that Pakistan had refused to respond to queries about how it would carry out the ICJ’s ruling to review and reconsider Jadhav’s case. “I think we have reached a point where we have to now decide whether we want to go back to ICJ for consequential directions because Pakistan has not moved ahead,” he had said.The ICJ ruled in July last year that Pakistan had violated Jadhav’s rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and stayed his execution while calling on Islamabad to take all measures for an “effective review and reconsideration” of his conviction and sentence, including “enacting appropriate legislation”.India has rejected the allegations against Jadhav and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. Pakistan has so far granted consular access to Jadhav only once since his arrest in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/baseless-inaccurate-pakistan-rejects-india-s-allegations-in-kulbhushan-jadhav-case/story-rBizqxVFC1aFbGY2UHisqL.html
10-05-2020||World||Seoul closes bars and clubs over fears of coronavirus second wave||South Korea’s capital has ordered the closure of all clubs and bars after a burst of new cases sparked fears of a second coronavirus wave, and President Moon Jae-in urged the public to remain vigilant.The nation has been held up as a global model in how to curb the virus, but the order from the Seoul mayor on Saturday followed a new infection cluster in Itaewon, one of the city’s busiest nightlife districts.More than 50 cases so far have been linked to a 29-year-old man who tested positive after spending time at five clubs and bars in Itaewon last weekend.“Carelessness can lead to an explosion in infections,” said Seoul mayor Park Won-soon, adding the order will remain in effect indefinitely.Gyeonggi province -- which surrounds Seoul with a population of around 12 million people -- also ordered more than 5,700 entertainment facilities to suspend operations for two weeks starting Sunday.With around 7,200 people estimated to have visited the five establishments, health authorities have warned of a further spike in infections and have asked those who went to any of the venues to get tested.Of the 34 new infections reported on Sunday, 24 were tied to the Itaewon cluster, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“We cannot but feel sorry to see the emergence of the new infection cluster surrounding the Itaewon clubs,” KCDC director Jeong Eun-kyeong told reporters. The spike in new infections came as everyday life in South Korea was slowly returning to normal, with the government relaxing social distancing rules last Wednesday.President Moon said Sunday the new cluster had “raised awareness that even during the stabilisation phase, similar situations can arise again anytime”.‘Not over’ “It’s not over until it’s over,” Moon said during a speech marking his third anniversary of taking office.“While keeping enhanced alertness till the end, we must never lower our guard regarding epidemic prevention,” he added.Moon has enjoyed growing public support on the back of his government’s handling of the virus, which led to a landslide victory for his ruling party at last month’s parliamentary elections.The usually bustling streets of Itaewon were largely empty on Sunday afternoon, with bars and clubs fronting signs reading “Temporarily closed for business” or “Prevention of assembly”.“I think this incident can happen anywhere, not only in Itaewon,” said Kim Jae-sung, a chef at a neighbourhood restaurant.“What is most important is one’s social distancing, avoiding enclosed places and being aware so that incidents like this won’t happen again,” he told AFP.Lee Seung-wook, a 22-year-old restaurant worker, added: “We hope customers will be more co-operative when we ask for their names for the visiting records since we all need to work together.”The country endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the disease outside mainland China, and while it never imposed a compulsory lockdown, strict social distancing had been widely observed since March.But it appears to have brought its outbreak under control thanks to an extensive “trace, test and treat” programme that has drawn widespread praise.Facilities such as museums and churches have reopened and some professional sports -- including baseball and soccer -- have started new seasons, while schools are set to re-open starting next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seoul-closes-bars-and-clubs-over-fears-of-coronavirus-second-wave/story-qygCQO4j5dD79Bt4lHD1lM.html

Mi Feng, a spokesperson for the National Health Commission, at a press conference in Beijing said the number of new Covid-19 cases in Wuhan had dropped to single digit. April 8: Wuhan lifted restrictions on outgoing travel on April 8 after nearly an 11-week lockdown and reporting a dramatic decrease in cases.Apr 15: China issued a revised death and case count. Nearly 1,300 people who died of the coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan, or half the total, were not counted in death tolls because of lapses, state media said.May 10: China reported 14 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday. This included one new case from Wuhan where no new Covid-19 case was reported in over a month, news agency Reuters reported.

A source familiar with the call confirmed them to Reuters.Obama said the election “is so important because what we’re going to be battling is not just a particular individual or a political party.”“What we’re fighting against is these long-term trends in which being selfish, being tribal, being divided, and seeing others as an enemy -- that has become a stronger impulse in American life,” he said.He said this is one reason why “the response to this global crisis has been so anemic and spotty.”“It would have been bad even with the best of governments. It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset -- of ‘what’s in it for me’ and ‘to heck with everybody else’ -- when that mindset is operationalized in our government,” Obama said.“That’s why, I, by the way, am going to be spending as much time as necessary and campaigning as hard as I can for Joe Biden,” he said.Obama’s office declined to comment.White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said Trump’s response to the coronavirus “has been unprecedented” and has saved American lives.She harked back to the Ukraine inquiry launched by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives last year that led to House passage of articles of impeachment against Trump. The Republican-led Senate acquitted Trump early this year.“While Democrats were pursuing a sham witch hunt against President Trump, President Trump was shutting down travel from China. While Democrats encouraged mass gatherings, President Trump was deploying PPE, ventilators, and testing across the country,” she said.National polls show a tight race between Trump and Biden with six months to go until the election. Biden leads in several battleground states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-leaked-call-obama-describes-trump-s-handling-of-covid-19-as-chaotic/story-PzqlpJp2cC7QoDT3QTBjrO.html

And Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergies and Infections Diseases told CNN he will be going in “modified quarantine”. All three are members of the White task force on the coronavirus outbreak.Fauci has said he will be working from home, will wear a mask and will go to office only when he will be sure to be the only one around at the time.Fauci, Hahn and Redfield are scheduled to testify before a committee of the US senate on Tuesday, but they will now not appear in person but through a video link.The source of their exposure was not identified. Katie Miller, press secretary of Vice-President Mike Pence, who tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, used to frequently attend the meeting of the task force, which is headed by her boss. She is the second White House staffer to test positive, after a US navy personnel serving as a personal valet to the president.The White House has stepped up screening since and both the president and the vice-president are now tested every day.At least 11 members of the US Secret Service, which protects present and past presidents, have also tested positive and 60 are in self-quarantine for possible exposure, according to news reports. It was not clear if any of them had been posted at the White House at the time of their exposure.President Donald Trump has personally faced criticism for not following his administration’s Covid-19 protocols to wear a mask in situations were social distancing may be difficult. He met US military leaders at the White House on Saturday and did not wear a face covering, neither did any of the others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-covid-19-task-force-officials-self-quarantine-after-possible-exposure/story-AVmdvWSU7fzAsFMnn4VdzI.html
10-05-2020||World||Rare inflammatory syndrome linked to Covid-19 kills 3 kids in New York, says governor Andrew Cuomo||Three children in New York have died from a rare inflammatory syndrome believed to be linked to the novel coronavirus, governor Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday, a development that may augur a pandemic risk for the very young.Both Cuomo and his counterpart in the neighbouring state of New Jersey also spoke on Saturday about the pandemic’s growing toll on mental health, another factor on the minds of governors as they weigh the impact of mounting job losses against health risks in moving to loosen restrictions on daily life.Nearly all of the 50 US states will have taken steps to relax lockdown measures by this weekend, including states like Arizona and Mississippi, which are reporting increasing infections of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, highlighting the risk of a new wave of outbreaks.Cuomo told a daily briefing that he was increasingly worried about a syndrome that shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease, which he said included inflammation of the blood vessels and potentially fatal damage to the heart.He said three children - including a five-year old disclosed on Friday - have died from such symptoms while also testing positive for Covid-19 or related antibodies, suggesting a link that was still not fully understood.Cuomo, who has emerged as a leading national voice on states’ response to the coronavirus crisis, said state health officials were reviewing 73 similar cases, which have rattled a prior assumption that children were largely not susceptible to the novel coronavirus.“We are not so sure that is the fact anymore. Toddler, elementary school children are presenting symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease or toxic shock-like syndrome,” Cuomo said. “It’s very possible that this has been going on for several weeks and it hasn’t been diagnosed as related to COVID.”Cuomo said state health officials had partnered with the New York Genome Center and the Rockefeller University to look at whether there is a genetic basis for the syndrome and have been asked by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop national criteria for identifying and treating cases.The syndrome shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease, which is associated with fever, skin rashes, swelling of the glands, and in severe cases, inflammation of arteries of the heart. Scientists are still trying to determine whether the syndrome is linked with the new coronavirus because not all children with it have tested positive for the virus.At a separate briefing, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said the death of a four-year old disclosed on Friday was not related to the syndrome. “This is a very specific situation with this blessed little kid and we are going to leave it at that.”‘TOXIC MIX’New York and New Jersey are at the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, accounting for nearly half of the 77,737 American deaths from Covid-19, according to a Reuters tally, and the two states have among the strictest lockdown rules still in place.They are also at the center of a devastating economic toll underscored in government data released on Friday showing the US unemployment rate rose to 14.7% last month, up from 3.5% in February and shattering the post-World War Two record of 10.8% set in November 1982. Cuomo said his state has seen increasing reports of mental health issues, substance abuse and domestic violence, all tied to the economic stress and isolation of the lockdowns.On Friday a study released by the Well Being Trust and the American Academy of Family Physicians estimated an additional 75,000 people could lose their lives to suicide, drugs and other contributors to “deaths of despair” stemming from the crisis.Murphy echoed those concerns. “The cure for the health crisis is keeping people isolated,” Murphy told his briefing. “You add to that job loss, small businesses that have been crushed. It’s a toxic mix.”Cuomo said 226 New Yorkers died from Covid-19 on Friday, up from 216 a day earlier, but less than half the levels recorded two weeks ago. He said hospitalizations and intubations continued their downward trend, further evidence the state has gained a measure of control over the virus.Murphy said an additional 166 residents of his state had died over the past 24 hours from Covid-19, bringing its total fatalities to 9,116, while total cases rose by 1,759 to 137,085.On a positive note, Murphy said the number of people hospitalized for the disease continued to fall, with the 422 patients discharged over the past 24 hours outpacing the 364 newly admitted for treatment.Yet Murphy warned against complacency and said his constituents should continue to practice social distancing. “We are not out of the woods, folks. Let’s not forget that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rare-inflammatory-syndrome-linked-to-covid-19-kills-3-kids-in-new-york-says-governor-andrew-cuomo/story-OqHynecg0iJNjSJWppn3YO.html
10-05-2020||World||Rock ‘n’ roll pioneer Little Richard dies at age 87||Little Richard, the self-proclaimed “architect of rock ‘n’ roll” who built his ground-breaking sound with a boiling blend of boogie-woogie, rhythm and blues and gospel, died on Saturday at the age of 87.Richard, a Grammy Award winner and inductee to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame whose electrifying 1950s hits such as “Tutti Frutti” and “Long Tall Sally” and flamboyant stage presence influenced legions of performers, succumbed to cancer. “Little Richard died in Tullahoma, Tennessee of bone cancer. He was loved by his family and adored by millions,” his family said in a statement through their lawyer, Bill Sobel.Richard’s bass guitarist, Charles Glenn, told celebrity website TMZ the musician had been sick for two months and that he died surrounded by his brother, sister and son.At his peak in the late 1950s and early ‘60s, Richard shouted, moaned, screamed and trilled hits like “Good Golly, Miss Molly” and “Lucille,” all the while pounding the piano like a mad man and punctuating lyrics with an occasional shrill “whoooo!”Time magazine said he played “songs that sounded like nonsense ... but whose beat seemed to hint of unearthly pleasures centered somewhere between the gut and the gutter.”The music drew in both young black and white fans at a time when parts of the United States still were strictly segregated. Many white artists, such as Pat Boone, had their own hit versions of Richard’s songs, albeit considerably toned down and “safer” for the pop audience.“I’ve always thought that rock ‘n’ roll brought the races together,” Richard once told an interviewer. “Although I was black, the fans didn’t care. I used to feel good about that.”Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney, James Brown, Otis Redding, David Bowie and Rod Stewart all cited Little Richard as an influence. Jimi Hendrix, who played in Richard’s band in the mid-1960s, said he wanted to use his guitar the way Richard used his voice.FASHION STATEMENT“I am the innovator,” Richard would tell interviewers and audiences. “I am the originator. I am the emancipator. I am the architect of rock ‘n’ roll!”Little Richard’s sonic extravagance was matched by his campy flamboyance. He wore brightly colored suits, a pencil-thin mustache, a carefully curled 6-inch pompadour, mascara, pancake makeup and lipstick.“Elvis may have been the king of rock ‘n ‘roll but I am the queen,” he proclaimed.He was born Dec. 5, 1932 as Richard Penniman to a poor family of 12 children in Macon, Georgia. Religion was a guiding force in his family, which attended Pentecostal, Baptist and African Methodist Episcopal churches. His faith was so deeply ingrained that at times it would overwhelm his rock career.His first performances were as a child in his church choir and his earliest inspirations were gospel singers, including Sister Rosetta Tharpe, who let a young Richard open her show when she stopped in Macon. A singer named Esquerita also influenced Richard’s fashion and manic musical style.He first went on the road in the late 1940s, performing in medicine shows and drag shows and with bands.Richard first recorded in the early 1950s and became a dominating force on the music charts starting in 1956 with hits such as “Tutti Frutti,” “Rip It Up,” “Slippin’ and Slidin’, and “Good Golly Miss Molly.” All were infused with the frantic rhythm of a runaway train.“Shining like a quasar, the most intensely radiant object in the cosmos, he seems to tap a mystical source of mental power that is only accessible to great preachers and shamans,” McCartney wrote in the preface to the 1994 biography “The Life and Times of Little Richard.”But Richard’s career took a turn in 1957 when he decided to abandon rock in the middle of a two-week tour of Australia.Richard told a biographer that he saw a fireball shoot across the sky during an outdoor performance in Sydney and took it as a sign from God to change his life. He said he later determined the fireball was the launch of Russia’s Sputnik satellite.A few months later, however, Richard was a student at a Bible college in Alabama. For a while he played only gospel music but slipped back into rock ‘n’ roll, sharing a bill with the young Beatles in Hamburg, Germany, in 1962.It was a pattern that persisted for years as Little Richard moved between rock ‘n’ roll, alcohol, cocaine and heroin abuse and Christianity and gospel music. He would go on to become an ordained Seventh Day Adventist minister and eventually worked gospel and rock both into his shows, along with a little preaching.“I talk about my life as a homosexual and a drug addict because I think it is right to tell people what God has done for me,” he wrote in his autobiography, “The Life and Times of Little Richard.”Richard was among the first inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 but missed the ceremony because he was recovering from an auto accident. Rolling Stone magazine ranked him No. 8 on its list of 100 greatest entertainers of all time and he received a lifetime achievement Grammy in 1993.“Little Richard bent gender, upset segregationist fault lines and founded a tradition of rock dadaists devoted to the art of self-creation,” a Rolling Stone critic said. “He went with the inspiration of the moment, be it divine or hormonal, and caromed like a shiny, cracked pinball between God, sex and rock ‘n’ roll.”As a minister, Richard officiated at weddings for Bruce Springsteen, Demi Moore, Bruce Willis, Cyndi Lauper and other celebrities.Richard suffered a heart attack in 2013 and hip problems required him to use a wheelchair at times.In a post on Instagram on Saturday, Richard’s longtime guitarist Kelvin Holly said, “Rest in peace, Richard. This one really stings.”“My thoughts and prayers go out to all my bandmates and fans all over the world. Richard truly was the king!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rock-n-roll-pioneer-little-richard-dies-at-age-87/story-Kwx1LKDLuetI4gNh2nEzCI.html
10-05-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson to set out Covid-19 warning system in public address||Boris Johnson will unveil a new virus alert system, similar to how the government currently communicates terror threat levels, in Sunday’s address to Britain that will set out some of the conditions for removing restrictions on the economy.The five-level alerts range from one (green), which would enable life to return to normal, to five (red). England is on the verge of improving from level four to three, which indicates that the Covid-19 infection rate isn’t increasing significantly, Johnson is expected to say. A new mantra is also set to make its debut: “Stay alert, control the virus and save lives.”“We will take the decisions that continue to save lives and protect the NHS, proceeding with maximum caution and maximum conditionality,” Johnson will say, according to a government official.Johnson will urge workers and businesses to stay alert by following social distancing rules, potentially angering some backbenchers in his Conservative Party who want a swift end to the lockdown that has scarred the economy. A person familiar with the matter earlier suggested that rules may not change significantly until June, when small shops may be allowed to reopen.The government will also announce long-awaited measures to deal with people flying or sailing into the country. Travellers, including Britons returning from abroad, will be told to self-isolate for 14 days as part of the government’s plans to try to avoid a second peak of the coronavirus.The new rules, set to kick in next month, will force travellers to declare where they plan to stay while they’re in isolation. Anyone found breaking the rules faces a fine of as much as 1,000 pounds or possible deportation.The measures are likely to heighten criticism that the government was slow to react to contain the pandemic, which has now killed more than 31,000 people in the U.K. -- the highest toll in Europe.Even in late March, an influential group of cross-party lawmakers asked the government why it hadn’t set out plans to better monitor people arriving at the nation’s airports and ports.For the world’s beleaguered airline industry, the measures give travelers yet another reason to think twice before taking to the skies and will probably end Britons’ plans of holidaying abroad this summer.British Airways, which has London’s Heathrow airport -- Europe’s busiest with some 80.9 million passengers a year -- as its home, is cutting 12,000 jobs, and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. is seeking to stave off collapse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-to-set-out-covid-19-warning-system-in-public-address/story-tw7IMd8cAXzdhEPObvt3HP.html
10-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Major US airlines endorse temperature checks for passengers||A major U.S. airline trade group on Saturday said it backed the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checking the temperatures of passengers and customer-facing employees during the coronavirus pandemic.Airlines for America, which represents the largest U.S. airlines including American Airlines, United Airlines , Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines, said the checks “will add an extra layer of protection for passengers as well as airline and airport employees. Temperature checks also will provide additional public confidence that is critical to relaunching air travel and our nation’s economy.”A U.S. official said Saturday no decision has been made on whether to mandate the checks, but said the issue is the subject of extensive talks among government agencies and with U.S. airlines and added a decision could potentially be made as early as next week.One possible route would be for a pilot project or to initially begin temperature checks at the largest U.S. airports. Questions remain about what the government would do if someone had a high temperature and was turned away from a flight.U.S. officials said the temperature checks would not eliminate the risk of coronavirus cases but could act as a deterrent to prevent people who were not feeling well from travelling.TSA Administrator David Pekoske told employees during a town hall meeting Wednesday that no decision had been made regarding possible temperature checks of passengers at airports and that questions remained about where such checks might take place and which agency might perform them.“It’s been a discussion that’s been ongoing for several weeks now,” he said.A TSA spokesman did not immediately comment Saturday.Frontier Airlines said on Thursday it would begin temperature screenings for all passengers and crew members on June 1 and bar anyone with a temperature at or exceeding 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 C).The move, the first among major U.S. airlines, followed the industry mandating facial coverings for all passengers and heightened cleaning procedures to address coronavirus concerns.The airline group said having temperature checks performed by the TSA “will ensure that procedures are standardized.”The endorsement comes amid signs of a modest travel rebound from historic lows. On Friday, TSA screened 215,444 people at airport checkpoints, the first time the number topped 200,000 since March 26. But that is still a fraction of the 2.6 million screened on the equivalent day last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-major-us-airlines-endorse-temperature-checks-for-passengers/story-PnWwStFz2VXI2f773PASPL.html
10-05-2020||World||US FDA gives emergency use approval to Covid-19 antigen tests||The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday issued an emergency use authorisation (EUA) for Covid-19 antigen tests. It is a new type of test that is easy to carry out and can help with early detection of the virus, right at the doctor’s clinic itself.This test can quickly detect fragments of proteins found on or within the Sars-CoV-2 virus by testing samples collected from the nasal cavity using swabs. The FDA has issued the EUA to Quidel Corporation for what is called Sofia 2 SARS Antigen FIA. The test has been approved for laboratory use as well as for point-of-care testing at some facilities.Antigen tests are very specific, but are not as sensitive as molecular PCR tests. This means positive results from antigen tests are highly accurate, but there is a higher chance of false negatives as well - so negative results don’t rule out the infection, the FDA said in a statement on Saturday. Negative results from an antigen test may need to be confirmed with an RT PCR test prior to making treatment decisions.“Its good to know that now there is an antigen test for Covid-19, but it remains to be seen how accurate it is. Antigen tests are rapid tests which turn positive earlier, which means they can detect an active infection... The greatest benefit of an antigen test is early diagnosis with rapid testing. But the kit has to be of high quality for the antigen test to be accurate,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director of CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology.Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of virology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said, “The antigen test can detect antigen of the virus. The Sars-CoV-2 has spikes, which are antigens that stimulate immune response in the body. These tests turn positive earlier but sensitivity is less compared to RT PCR. But these tests can be done anywhere even in a doctor’s office.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-gives-emergency-use-approval-to-covid-19-antigen-tests/story-83QtFohVXtoBJAv6T9bwYM.html
10-05-2020||World||Fire breaks out at Moscow coronavirus hospital, one dead||One person was killed after a fire broke out on Saturday at a Moscow hospital treating patients infected with the new coronavirus, the authorities said.The hospital, located in northwestern Moscow, had been designated by the authorities as one of the medical facilities treating coronavirus patients in the Russian capital.The emergency ministry told the RIA news agency that the blaze erupted in a patient’s room, without providing further details. The fire has since been put out, the authorities said.Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, wrote on Twitter that all patients had been evacuated and would be transferred to other hospitals.“The causes of this incident will be thoroughly investigated,” Sobyanin wrote.Moscow and several other regions have been on lockdown since late March to stem the spread of the coronavirus, which has so far infected nearly 200,000 people and caused more than 1,800 deaths in Russia.More than half of the country’s cases and deaths have been recorded in Moscow, a sprawling city of 12.7 million.The number of Russian coronavirus cases this week overtook French and German infections to become the fifth-highest in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-breaks-out-at-moscow-coronavirus-hospital-one-dead/story-qU3twM2wuKrtTcFqSTc23M.html
10-05-2020||World||US lawmakers propose bill, 40,000 Covid-19 health workers set to get green cards||A bipartisan group of US senators have introduced a legislation to grant 40,000 unused Green Cards to foreign nurses and physicians to fight the coronavirus epidemic.They have proposed granting 25,000 of the Green Cards to nurses and the rest 15,000 to physicians, which include both those hired abroad or those already in the United States.The US grants around 1 million Green Cards a year, which are subject to a per country-limit of 7%.Medical professionals from India may stand to benefit as those from other parts of the world. But the queue of applicants from India for employment-based Green Cards is already very long, with waiting periods of more than 100 years at the current rate of disposal of cases, and it could not be ascertained if Indian medial professionals will be able circumvent this queue.“Consider this: One-sixth of our health care workforce is foreign-born. Immigrant nurses and doctors play a vital role in our healthcare system, and their contributions are now more crucial than ever. Where would we be in this pandemic without them?” said Senator Richard Durbin, the Democratic who cosponsored the legislation, in a statement. “This bipartisan, targeted, and timely legislation will strengthen our health care workforce and improve health care access for Americans in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.”“This proposal would simply reallocate a limited number of unused visas from prior years for doctors and nurses who are qualified to help in our fight against Covid-19,” said Senator David Perdue, a Republican, in a statement.Democrat Chris Coons and Republican Tod Young were the other two senators backing the bill.The Trump administration has suspended all immigrant visas for 60 days to ensure Americans hit by record layoffs caused by the Covid-19 lockdown get the first shot at remaining jobs or those that become available as businesses reopen. But physicians, nurses and other healthcare professionals were among those exempted from the temporary ban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-propose-bill-to-bring-foreign-medical-professionals/story-h8MsYTa591No8CtW3fGoEM.html
