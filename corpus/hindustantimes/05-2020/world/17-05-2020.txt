Wuhan kicked off a campaign on May 14 to look for asymptomatic carriers - people who are infected but show no outward sign of illness - after confirming last weekend its first cluster of COVID-19 infections since its release from a virtual lockdown on April 8. The number of tests carried out on May 16 in the city of 11 million residents was more than the 186,400 tests conducted on May 14-15, and was also the highest since the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission started publishing the data on Feb. 21.Wuhan is conducting the testing on a voluntary basis. Residents who were previously tested do not need to participate in the campaign. Those who test positive now will be notified as soon as possible.No confirmed cases with symptoms were identified May 14-16, though 28 new asymptomatic carriers were found, according to daily reports published by the Wuhan health authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-wuhan-nearly-doubles-number-of-covid-19-tests-per-day/story-02IQ2lFLInhHSkwZ33ELoN.html

The man is also the father of the dead child.It was the latest attack on civilians in the fighting over Tripoli between eastern-based forces under military commander Khalifa Hifter and an array of militias loosely allied with the U.N.-supported but weak government in the capital.A fire broke out in parts of the shelter housing people displaced by previous clashes in Tripoli, Merset said.The ambulance services did not say which side was responsible for the shelling.The self-styled Libyan Arab Armed Forces, led by Hifter, launched an offensive to take Tripoli in April last year. In recent weeks, the fighting has intensified as foreign backers of the two sides stepped up their military support.Hifter is backed by France and Russia, as well as Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and other key Arab countries. The Tripoli-allied militias are aided by Turkey, which deployed troops and mercenaries to help shore up their allies earlier this year, as well as by Italy and Qatar. Mercenaries, mainly from the Syria battlefield, are now fighting on both sides and complicating an already complex proxy war.Earlier this year, Tripoli-allied militias took several western towns from Hifter’s forces and stepped up their attacks using drones supplied by Turkey on a key military base and the town of Tarhuna.Hifter’s LAAF said Saturday it shot down a Turkish drone that was trying to attack the al-Watiya airbase. The Tripoli-allied militias claimed they destroyed a Russian-made anti-aircraft system, a claim dismissed by the LAAF.Libya has been in turmoil since 2011, when a civil war toppled and later killed long-time dictator Moammar Gadhafi. The country has since split between rival administrations in the east and the west, each backed by armed groups and foreign countries.The Tripoli fighting has threatened to push Libya into a major conflagration on the scale of the 2011 civil war.(AP) RUP RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bombs-kill-7-in-shelter-for-displaced-in-libya-officials/story-Zfgu1mo8qiDEmyz6TXLHAJ.html

Of the total cases, 86 patients were being treated.The deadly virus has claimed 4,634 lives in the country, the NHC said.Understanding is growing of the effects of the novel coronavirus on the organs of patients, even after they apparently recover.While most patients, especially those with mild and moderate symptoms, can recover without long-term consequences to their health, studies indicated that those with severe symptoms can have organ damage and require a much longer time for rehabilitation, the report said.The NHC said some COVID-19 patients might also develop heart problems such as angina and arrhythmia – conditions that could result directly from the virus or arise after a patient has been bedridden for a long time.The guidelines also list potential mental health problems resulting from COVID-19, including depression, insomnia, eating disorders and various changes in cognitive functions. Other problems identified in the guidelines include muscle and limb-function loss, the Post reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-can-cause-long-term-organ-damage-china-adds-after-effects-to-medical-insurance/story-HyIeltjEWDgRfN1DZpncSK.html

17-05-2020||World||Lockdown fatigue spreads quicker than the Coronavirus in Africa||Two months after most African nations closed their borders and imposed lockdowns to contain the spread of the coronavirus, they’re deciding it’s not worth the economic cost.Countries began shutting their economies soon after the first case was detected in Nigeria in February and before the disease started to take hold on the continent. That helped keep Africa’s reported case count well below 80,000 out of a population of some 1.2 billion people. But as the pandemic risks dragging them into the worst economic recession on record, governments from Ghana in the west to Rwanda in the east have started to ease restrictions.Faced with an impossible dilemma -- starvation and deepening poverty or a wider outbreak -- many leaders are opting to save people’s livelihoods.“Africa is now victim of its success,” said Nana Poku, a political economist and vice chancellor of the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. “Thanks to a strong public-health response, we have kept the number of infections and deaths relatively low. Compared to those numbers, the economic cost of Covid-19 in terms of lost output and increased poverty seems very large.”The first country in sub-Saharan Africa to ban travelers from high-risk countries, Ghana also led the way in easing curbs when it lifted its 21-day lockdown on April 20. Even though the number of confirmed cases subsequently increased five-fold after the easing, the situation had become financially untenable in a country where the informal economy accounts for 90% of employment, the government said.“We can’t stop economic activity in our country, our social lives, our children’s education, so we need to do something that will enable us to live our normal lives,” Health Minister Kwaku Agyeman-Manu said May 14. “We should begin to accept the fact that the disease will be with us for a while.”Rich FluGhana’s neighbors are following suit. Ivory Coast on Friday began lifting a curfew in its biggest city, Abidjan, allowing restaurants and bars that play an outsized cultural role, similar to those in France, to reopen immediately. Mosques and churches are being allowed to receive worshipers again from this weekend in Burkina Faso, where many people see Covid-19 as a flu that mainly affects the rich and adherence to restrictions is low.In Nigeria, a five-week lockdown of the two main cities was only half-heartedly observed, with traffic jams and crowded streets persisting. Exasperated by dense queues at banks and residents venturing outside without face masks, the governor of Lagos warned this week that a new lockdown may be imposed if people continue to flout public-health guidelines.As many as 190,000 people could die of Covid-19 and 44 million could be infected in Africa in the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to the World Health Organization. The body has urged a gradual easing of lockdowns to avoid a surge in infections.Gradual Approach“Containment measures, which include contact tracing, isolation, improved personal hygiene practices and physical distancing aim to slow down the transmission of the virus so its effects happen at a rate manageable by the health system,” the WHO said May 7. “Physical distancing is not about the confinement of people, but rather avoiding unnecessary contacts as people live, work and socialize as a means to interrupt transmission.”In South Africa, which has the continent’s highest number of confirmed infections, the government is taking the gradual approach -- on May 1 it began relaxing one of the world’s strictest lockdowns in place since March 27.But with thousands of small businesses at risk of collapse and the central bank expecting the economy to shrink 6.1% this year, business leaders and mining companies are asking the government to reconsider its rules and accelerate the easing of restrictions.The country’s largest platinum miner, Sibanye Stillwater Ltd., urged President Cyril Ramaphosa this week to let mines run at full capacity in order to avoid a complete shut-down. Even though miners have been allowed to restart operations with half their normal workers, that isn’t sufficient, Chief Executive Officer Neal Froneman said.“We are causing more harm by constraining the economy than we are impacting positively on Covid-19,” he said. “We have gone too far now, we now need to get the economy to start up.”The real emergency may not be the virus, but the fallout from the pandemic, said Leena Koni Hoffmann, associate fellow of the Africa program at Chatham House in the U.K.“Tens of millions of people across the continent were already in vulnerable situations before this,” she said. “The cure for the pandemic, especially in African economies, is worse than the virus itself.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lockdown-fatigue-spreads-quicker-than-the-coronavirus-in-africa/story-WhpwFDB4zWVrUHAItf9UVK.html
17-05-2020||World||Covid-19 could mean the end of small charities||Non-profit groups in the U.S. and other countries could shutter operations entirely as a result of the coronavirus, even as billions of dollars are donated to pandemic-relief efforts.Many local non-profits that count on small donors are in trouble, said Rick Cohen, chief operating officer of the U.S.-based National Council of Nonprofits. Canceled events, a sudden withdrawal of government financing and the forced closure of stores that were sources of revenue have led to a depletion of funds, he said.Charitable organizations around the world have suffered in recent months with income and fundraising streams drying up as tens of millions of people lost their jobs or faced greater financial difficulty. The London Marathon, for instance, raised 66 million pounds ($80 million) for various U.K. charities in 2019, but this year’s run that was scheduled for April has been postponed.“Nonprofits are facing devastation right now,” Cohen said in an email. “Some are facing skyrocketing demands for their services, others are seeing funding dry up, and some are seeing both at the same time.”Tracking Gifts, Donations Made to Fight Coronavirus: Bloomberg TrackerAbout 53% of donors said they plan to be giving more carefully during the pandemic but will continue to still donate, while 20% said they will stop until there’s a return to economic growth, according to a survey carried out for Dunham+Company.The rest said they would keep on giving, the survey showed, citing the sentiment is stronger among donors who frequent religious services at least weekly.“The oldest donors, regular churchgoers, and self-described conservative donors were significantly more likely to say their giving would remain unchanged compared to younger donors, less frequent churchgoers, and liberal donors,” according to Dunham.Ramadan EffectDonating to charity is ingrained in the Islamic month of Ramadan, and much of this is typically raised through collection boxes at mosques, gala dinners and other fundraising methods, as many Muslims attend nightly prayers at their local places of worship. But with mosques closed around the world, more Muslims have instead turned to donating online.MyTenNights, a non-profit organization that collects donations for several charities in five countries, said at least 6.8 million pounds has been donated to a number of aid groups on its online portal. That compares with 2.7 million pounds at the same point last year.“The general charity sector has taken a hit, but the Muslim charity space has responded favorably to the current circumstances,” Ismael Abdela, co-founder of MyTenNights, said in an interview. “Two of our main charity partners are up 50% on year-on-year donations, and it’s too early to have any studies on this, but anecdotally, what I would suspect is that there’s a heightened sense of connectedness to faith at this time.”Corporate PhilanthropyWhile individuals may not be able to donate as much as before, corporate giving has soared in the last few months and accounts for more than $5 billion of donations, according to Candid, a group that tracks global philanthropy. Twitter Inc.’s Jack Dorsey is the largest single donor, contributing $1 billion, while Alphabet Inc.’s Google is the largest corporate donor, giving more than $907 million, its data showed.Philanthropic giving toward the Covid-19 pandemic is 10 times higher than the amount donated in the aftermath of the 9/11 attack, and reflects the global nature of the coronavirus, said Andrew Grabois, corporate philanthropy manager at Candid.“The global surge in giving for Covid-19 relief efforts reflects the scope and hybrid nature of the pandemic,” he said. “It is a public health disaster affecting the health and mortality of people in every country and continent and a crushing economic crisis that has forced more than a billion people worldwide to quarantine and countless businesses to shutter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-could-mean-the-end-of-small-charities/story-M6wIFIGyxNdNX8ZNXMP7GN.html

The list is headed by entrepreneur James Dyson, who made his fortune by inventing bag-less vacuum cleaners. Dyson and family are estimated to be worth £16.2 billion, while Sri and Gopi Hinduja and family are worth £16 billion.List compiler Robert Watts said: “Ever since the financial crisis of 2008-9, Britain’s wealthiest people have become richer and richer. Covid-19 has called time on their golden period. This year’s rich list paints a picture of Britain on the brink of calamity - two months after lockdown and already billions of pounds have been wiped out”.“You may not like the super-rich, but it is hard to deny that our economy will need the jobs they create and the taxes they and their companies pay if we are to escape a prolonged recession that causes further misery to millions.”The top ten in the list are: David and Simon Reuben (£16 billion), Leonard Blavatnik (£15.78 billion), Jim Ratcliffe (£12.15 billion), Kirsten and Jorn Rausing (£12.1 billion), Alisher Usmanov (£11.68 billion), Guy, George and Galen Jr Weston and family (£10.53 billion), Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken and Michel de Carvalho (£10.3 billion), the Duke of Westminster and the Grosvenor family (£10.29 billion).Queen Elizabeth is ranked at 372 with an estimated worth of £350 million.The list organisers said: “We have adjusted valuations of the richest 1,000 where there have been significant movements in the share prices of quoted companies, estimating the knock-on effect on the fortunes of owners of large stakes in those companies”.“We measure identifiable wealth, whether land, property, racehorses, art or significant shares in publicly quoted companies. We exclude bank accounts to which we have no access and small shareholdings in a private equity”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-wipes-billions-off-super-rich-hindujas-lose-top-spot/story-9HjzWW9urcHm5LNobMhGNI.html

There remains a very long way to go, and I must be frank that a vaccine might not come to fruition”.“But we are leading the global effort. Some of the most promising research into vaccines is happening right here in the UK - and this weekend we are announcing a £93 million investment to open the new Vaccine Manufacturing and Innovation Centre a full 12 months ahead of schedule”.The under-construction facility will have capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as six months. The funding will ensure the centre opens in summer 2021, a year ahead of schedule.To be located on the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxfordshire, the new centre will be the UK’s first not-for-profit organisation established to develop and advance the mass production of vaccines. The centre will also accelerate the production of vaccines for existing illnesses such as the flu virus.Business secretary Alok Sharma said: “As the biggest contributor to the international coalition to find a vaccine, the UK is leading the global response. Once a breakthrough is made, we need to be ready to manufacture a vaccine by the millions”.As of Saturday, the UK-wide death was 34,466, with a cumulative number of 240,161 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-may-not-come-to-fruition-says-pm-boris-johnson/story-XusOA6gmkhLwZzPxKD8TxO.html

Residents were advised not to leave the city and any who do need to leave must provide a negative test result taken within the previous 48 hours.Jilin is the second largest city of Jilin province, which borders North Korea and Russia. It temporarily suspended passenger train services last Wednesday. The number of China’s new asymptomatic cases of the coronavirus fell to 12 from 13, the NHC said.Zhong Nanshan, the Chinese government’s senior medical adviser told CNN on Saturday that the danger of a second wave of infections is looming large. “The majority of... Chinese at the moment are still susceptible to COVID-19 infection because (of) a lack of immunity,” Zhong said as quoted in the CNN report. “We are facing (a) big challenge, it’s not better than the foreign countries I think at the moment.”Zhong acknowledged that the number of infections were initially under reported in Wuhan but said the government has learned lessons from the SARS epidemic 17 years ago and he thinks all the data will be correct since Jan. 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-five-new-coronavirus-cases-adviser-says-risk-of-second-wave-remains/story-ZvoX6MJ4AmkIueKtr2Dz7H.html

The document also stresses that spraying individuals with disinfectants is “not recommended under any circumstances”.“This could be physically and psychologically harmful and would not reduce an infected person’s ability to spread the virus through droplets or contact,” said the document. Spraying chlorine or other toxic chemicals on people can cause eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm and gastrointestinal effects, it adds. The organisation is also warning against the systematic spraying and fumigating of disinfectants on to surfaces in indoor spaces, citing a study that has shown it to be ineffective outside direct spraying areas. “If disinfectants are to be applied, this should be done with a cloth or wipe that has been soaked in disinfectant,” it says.The SARS-CoV-2 virus, the cause of the pandemic that has killed more than 300,000 people worldwide since its appearance in late December in China, can attach itself to surfaces and objects. However, no precise information is currently available for the period during which the viruses remain infectious on the various surfaces. Studies have shown that the virus can stay on several types of surfaces for several days. However, these maximum durations are only theoretical because they are recorded under laboratory conditions and should be “interpreted with caution” in the real-world environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spraying-disinfectants-in-open-doesn-t-kill-coronavirus-can-even-be-harmful-who/story-DsGokgMale5PCKol45qVXK.html

Bill Gates has also privately funded SCAN, according to the foundation.On Thursday, SCAN in a statement said it has been in talks with the FDA since March 1 and initiated its request for emergency use authorization (EUA) on March 23, submitting data on April 13. “We have been notified that a separate federal emergency use authorization is required to return results for self-collected tests,” SCAN said.Representatives for the Food and Drug Administration did not have an immediate comment on SCAN’s status. Representatives of King County Health Department referred questions to SCAN. SCAN said it did not have an update on specific timing for when testing would restart. Separately, the FDA on Saturday approved a standalone at-home sample collection kit for Everlywell Inc, a health and wellness company, which launched its kit in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-suspends-bill-gates-backed-at-home-covid-19-testing-program/story-78Glv1xhcLh2VMtPscHP1I.html

It trails the U.S., Russia, and UK The numbers exceed those in Spain, which has a total of 230,698 cases and is planning to extend the state of emergency for a fifth time to combat the outbreak.Brazil’s new cases come as Vice President Hamilton Mourao and his wife are in self-isolation after a civil servant he came into contact with tested positive for Covid-19, according to a note sent by his press office. They are awaiting test results, which are expected on Monday.The country reported a daily record for cases on Friday -- hours after Jair Bolsonaro lost his second health minister in under a month as the president’s reopen-at-all-costs stance alienates the medical community and deepens a political clash with state governors.Nelson Teich, who took over the post in April after Bolsonaro fired his predecessor amid public discord over social distancing, quit Friday after just 29 days on the job. The health ministry gave no details on who will replace him.Brazil reported a record 15,305 new cases on Friday, solidifying its status as the new global hotspot for the disease. Still, it has a lower death rate than Spain and other badly-hit countries. Brazil lost 816 Covid-19 patients in the past 24 hours, raising total fatalities to 15,633 -- which is almost half of the death toll of Spain, France and Italy.Investors have taken notice of the turmoil. Brazil has the world’s worst-performing stock market and currency.

17-05-2020||World||WHO says 8 Covid-19 vaccine candidates in clinical trial||A total of eight vaccine candidates for Covid-19 are in the clinical trial while another 110 are in various stages of development across the globe, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) data.As governments around the world scramble to curb the contagion, pharmaceutical companies and health institutes in countries like United States, China, and Germany are leading the development to combat the virus, South China Morning Post reported.As things stand, several countries like the US, and China have even announced tentative dates by when they plan to get a vaccine ready.On Saturday, Chinese health official, Zhang Wenhong said a successful vaccine against the coronavirus can be administered to humans as early as March in 2021.“There are uncertainties in developing vaccines. Coronaviruses, including MERS and SARS, have not seen a particularly reliable one so far... the best scenario is that if one of the vaccines that people are making is effective and progressing relatively fast, it should be available as soon as possible from March to June next year,” Zhang was quoted by the Global Times.Earlier, US President Donald Trump had expressed confidence that a vaccine for coronavirus could be available by the end of the year.“I think we’ll have a vaccine by the end of the year,” Trump said at a Fox News virtual town hall. “We’ll have a vaccine much sooner rather than later.”As the world leaders continue to expedite the date of vaccine, Covid-19 continues to affect the world with over 4.6 million affected with the virus and more than 311,425 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-8-covid-19-vaccine-candidates-in-clinical-trial/story-oSjlCHjzJtyjEcErJd0v6J.html
17-05-2020||World||Religious leaders can play pivotal role to combat Covid-19 pandemic, says UN chief||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday said the religious leaders around the world can play an important role to deliver solutions in the fight against Covid-19 pandemic and help people recover from effects of the illness.“To defeat Covid-19 and build a more sustainable and equitable world, we need communities to come together. Religious leaders can play a pivotal role to deliver solutions to not only address the pandemic but to recover better,” Guterres posted on his Twitter. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe Secretary-General on May 12 had made similar remarks at a high-level video conference entitled, “The Role of Religious Leaders in addressing the multiple challenges of Covid-19.”“It is heartening to see so many religious leaders joining forces today in a spirit of solidarity. Our world faces a crisis like no other. The Covid-19 pandemic is not just a global health emergency. It is a human crisis that is upending lives, destroying livelihoods and deepening mistrust around the world,” he said. He also said that the world knows from previous public health crises that the actions of faith leaders influence people’s values, attitudes, behaviours, and actions.At the conference, he thanked religious leaders for supporting my appeal for a global ceasefire in view of Covid-19. However, he also noted that certain place around the world continues to see conflicts unabated. “Yet we continue to see conflicts rage in many places -- along with a rise in ethnonationalism, stigma and hate speech targeting vulnerable communities and exacerbating suffering. Meanwhile, extremists and radical groups are seeking to exploit eroding trust in leadership and feed on people’s vulnerability to serve their own ends,” he said.He also asked the religious leaders to reject and condemn all forms of intolerance that surged amid coronavirus.“...reject xenophobia, racism and all forms of intolerance. Second, I also made an appeal for peace at home. Across the globe, we are seeing an alarming increase in violence against women and girls as this pandemic spreads. This is in violation of principles common to every faith, and I appeal to religious leaders to categorically condemn such acts,” he added.He also stressed the need to fight the spread of misinformation amid the pandemic.“...as we fight the spread of disinformation and misinformation, I ask religious leaders to leverage your networks and communication capacities to support governments in promoting WHO-recommended public health measures.”Lastly, he urged faith leaders to support the continuity of education, working with education providers to find solutions to combat the effect of the contagion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/religious-leaders-can-play-pivotal-role-to-combat-covid-19-pandemic-says-un-chief/story-nqi9JiueW6PY1pwjgKNMbI.html
17-05-2020||World||Italy to reopen borders for EU tourists in early June, scrap quarantine||Italy will reopen to European tourists from early June and scrap a 14-day mandatory quarantine period, the government said on Saturday, as it quickened the exit from the coronavirus lockdown.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte enforced an economically crippling shutdown in early March to counter a pandemic that has so far killed more than 31,500 people in Italy.The shutdown halted all holidaymaking in a country heavily dependent on the tourism industry.Although Italy never formally closed its borders and has allowed people to cross back and forth for work or health reasons, it banned movement for tourism and imposed a two-week isolation period for new arrivals.In March, the European Union banned foreign nationals from entering its Schengen zone, an open border zone comprising 22 of 27 member states, with exceptions for medical workers and essential travel. But on Wednesday, the EU set out plans for a phased restart of summer travel, urging member states to reopen its internal borders, while recommending that external borders remain shut for most travel until at least the middle of June. In a press release, Italy’s government did not explicitly state which foreign nationals would be allowed to enter, but said its new measures respected the “legal order of the European Union”.Beginning on June 3, visitors within the Schengen zone will be allowed to enter Italy with no obligation to self-isolate. Italians will also be able to move between regions, though local authorities can limit travel if infections spike.Movements to and from abroad can be limited by regional decree “in relation to specific states and territories, in accordance with the principles of adequacy and proportionality to the epidemiological risk”, the government said. The latest decree is also a boon to Italy’s agricultural sector, which relies on roughly 350,000 seasonal workers from abroad.Farming lobby group Coldiretti said farms were already preparing to organise some 150,000 workers from places including Romania, Poland and Bulgaria. The peak of Italy’s contagion passed at the end of March but with experts warning a second wave cannot be ruled out, Conte had been reluctant to lift the lockdown quickly.His approach frustrated many of Italy’s regions, with some already allowing businesses to reopen before the restrictions were lifted.Restaurants, bars and hairdressers are being allowed to reopen on Monday, two weeks earlier than initially planned. Shops will also open and Italians will finally be able to see friends, as long as they live within their same region.Church services will begin again but the faithful will have to follow social distancing rules and holy water fonts will be empty. Mosques will also reopen.Gatherings of large groups are still banned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-to-reopen-borders-for-eu-tourists-in-early-june-scrap-quarantine/story-7abuOt0oskxuKcem9NFhSP.html
17-05-2020||World||China set to be challenged on Covid-19 handling at key WHO meeting||At the first meeting of the World Health Organization’s governing body since Covid-19 stormed the globe, China is set to be challenged on two of its most sensitive issues: The Communist Party’s initial handling of the virus and the status of Taiwan’s participation.While the U.S. has launched a daily barrage of attacks on China, including suggesting the virus escaped from a laboratory in the central city of Wuhan, the European Union and Australia are set to play a key role pushing for a probe into the virus’s origin when the World Health Assembly -- the WHO’s decision making body -- gathers on Monday for an annual meeting in Geneva.A U.S.-backed bloc is also pushing for Taiwan, whose handling of the virus has been a rare success story, to attend the meeting as an observer. The move -- aimed at strengthening Taiwan’s official and unofficial diplomatic relationships -- has angered China, which views the island as a province and has long sought to isolate it on the world stage.The showdown reflects a broader geopolitical struggle pitting the U.S. and its allies against China, whose authoritarian system has come under scrutiny in the wake of a pandemic that has killed about 300,000 people and devastated the global economy. The U.S. has suspended funding for the WHO, claiming it’s biased toward China, and even suggested setting up an alternative body.Yet for all the noise, most analysts expect China to command support from a large swathe of the nearly 200 countries taking part in the assembly that need good relations with the world’s second-biggest economy to shore up domestic growth. And any effort to replace the WHO is also unlikely to gain traction.“As much as the WHO has struggled and been the subject of criticism in this crisis, any replacement would look remarkably similar to what we have today,” said Natasha Kassam, a former Australian diplomat in China who is now a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. “It is hard to imagine an effective global health institution that excluded China, and it’s hard to imagine the United States making Taiwan’s participation a red line.”Boycott ThreatsStill, the anger in some parts of the world over China’s response to the pandemic is still fresh, and will likely play out this week. Apart from an initial cover up, the world has become increasingly upset with China’s heavy-handed response to any criticism.Australia in particular has felt the heat from Beijing, which threatened a boycott of its goods and also suspended meat imports from four processing plants for “technical” reasons. The government in Canberra called the boycott threats “economic coercion” and hasn’t backed down on its calls for a virus probe.“You can’t let the trail go cold,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters on May 8. “And I think Australia and the United States and the United Kingdom and countries all around the world would like to know what happened, because we don’t want to see it happen again.”While the EU was still working out the wording of the proposal in the run-up to the assembly, the European Commission has said a draft resolution envisaged calling for “an independent review on lessons learned from the international health response to the coronavirus.”Australia has said that could happen through the WHO’s Health Emergencies Program, which was set up after the Ebola crisis in 2014, and the International Health Regulations Review Committee, which assessed the response to the H1N1 pandemic in 2009.Red LineThe building acrimony has also made more countries willing to pressure China on Taiwan, which is a red line for authorities in Beijing. President Tsai Ing-wen’s government in Taipei has made a vocal pitch to be included in the proceedings this week, saying it needs access to firsthand information about the spread of the disease.The WHO has said its Ethiopian director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has no mandate to offer Taiwan an invitation to the assembly because there is “no clear support” among member states. Tedros in April had accused Taiwan of being behind a racist campaign against him and Africans in general -- a charge that Taipei rejected as “slander.”A proposal backed by 13 member states has called for the assembly to make a call on whether Taiwan can attend. China has blocked Taiwan’s participation in the organization since the independence-leaning Tsai was elected in 2016 and refused to accept that both sides belong to “one China.”The U.S. is “determined” to see Taiwan participate in the meetings as an observer, with a spokesperson at the U.S. Mission in Geneva saying that lessons from its successful experience fighting Covid-19 “would be of significant benefit to the rest of the world.”“The People’s Republic of China would rather that success not be shared, no doubt to avoid uncomfortable comparisons,” the spokesperson said.Blocking TaiwanFor its part, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said it “firmly rejects” countries’ proposal to invite Taiwan to attend the assembly, and has also blasted the call for an independent probe into the virus origin as “political maneuvering.”“Certain countries insisted on discussing proposals involving Taiwan to politicize a public health issue,” Zhao said Friday. “This consequence can only severely interfere with the progress of the conference and undermine international cooperation.”China is confident that the majority of countries won’t allow Taiwan to participate as an observer, and Beijing would “never” allow an independent investigative team inside its borders, said Shi Yinhong, an adviser to China’s cabinet and also a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.“It’s becoming clear that China’s basic stance is to reject criticism, and focus on the efforts it has made in the global fight,” Shi said. “This is a position that China won’t change, hence posing a sharp opposition to the voices of accusing its cover-up and claiming accountability.”Legally there’s no provision in the WHO’s constitution, resolutions or rules of procedure that would prevent Tedros from inviting Taiwan to the assembly as an observer, said Julian G. Ku, a distinguished professor of constitutional law at Hofstra University, who studies China’s relationship with international law. Since nobody is asking the WHO to invite Taiwan as a member state or to recognize Taiwan as the representative of China, the body’s citation of a 1971 United Nations decision recognizing Beijing is “irrelevant,” he said.Still, a majority of assembly members are likely to block Taiwan’s participation, according to Kharis Templeman, an adviser to the Project on Taiwan in the Indo-Pacific at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution.“It’s just a fact of international politics now that most countries aren’t willing to risk their relationship with the PRC to take symbolic actions in support of Taiwan,” he said, referring to China’s formal name. “As long as Beijing makes countries choose between them, Taiwan is going to lose.”The U.S. can hardly complain about China’s influence in the WHO given that it encouraged Beijing to play a greater role in international organizations for years, said Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.“Now the U.S. is crying foul because it turns out Chinese interests don’t align with its own and China is pretty darn good at playing this game,” Kennedy said. “If the U.S. doesn’t want a Chinese-led international order, it needs to do a better job of fighting for its own vision within these organizations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-set-to-be-challenged-on-covid-19-handling-at-key-who-meeting/story-zsIxB2USd9aqv5D7R6KUMI.html
17-05-2020||World||Ex-president Obama criticises US officials’ coronavirus response in online graduation speech||Former President Barack Obama on Saturday criticized some officials overseeing the coronavirus response, telling college graduates in an online commencement address that the pandemic shows many officials “aren’t even pretending to be in charge.”Obama spoke on “Show Me Your Walk, HBCU Edition,” a two-hour livestreaming event for historically black colleges and universities broadcast on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. His remarks were surprisingly political and touched on current events beyond the virus and its social and economic impacts.“More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they’re doing,” he said. “A lot them aren’t even pretending to be in charge.”Obama did not name President Donald Trump or any other federal or state officials.As he congratulated graduates and commiserated over the difficult world they face, the former president noted the February shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, who was killed while jogging on a residential street in Georgia.“Let’s be honest: A disease like this just spotlights the underlying inequalities and extra burdens that black communities have historically had to deal with in this country,” Obama said. “We see it in the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on our communities, just as we see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him if he doesn’t submit to their questioning.”Obama will also deliver a televised prime-time commencement address later Saturday for the high school Class of 2020 during an hour-long event that will also feature LeBron James, Malala Yousafzai and Ben Platt, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-president-obama-criticises-us-officials-coronavirus-response-in-online-graduation-speech/story-lfDiuAjBmfu0htoQQvQsvL.html
