The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject.The extent of Gulf Arab ties with Israel is still mostly kept private, though. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have allegedly used Israeli spyware to go after government critics.Oman, which has ties with Iran, hosted the Israeli prime minister in a surprise visit in 2018 that served to remind Washington of its unique ability to be a conduit for talks.But such ties remain highly contentious among the Arab public, particularly as the Palestinians remain without a state of their own despite decades of talks.Israel and the Palestinian Authority imposed sweeping lockdowns in mid-March aimed at containing the virus, limiting travel and public gatherings and forcing nonessential businesses to close. Many of the restrictions have been lifted in recent weeks as the rate of new infections has declined.Israel has reported more than 16,600 cases and around 270 deaths, with more than 13,000 of the patients having recovered. The Palestinian Authority has reported around 390 cases and two fatalities, with around 340 people having recovered.The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, who recover within a few weeks. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness or death, particularly in older patients or those with underlying conditions.The Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, the third holiest site in Islam, will reopen next week after the conclusion of a major holiday marking the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan. It follows weeks of closure aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. It had been closed since March over the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/etihad-airways-to-fly-aid-for-palestinians-in-first-known-flight-between-uae-and-israel/story-uTUTznmzzDtNES4qjuL16O.html
19-05-2020||World||Unemployment in UK highest since 1996; severe recession likely, says Rishi Sunak||Unemployment claims in Britain jumped by a record amount in April to their highest level since the 1990s, underscoring the impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the economy despite government programs to keep workers on payrolls.Treasury chief Rishi Sunak downplayed the chances of a swift recovery in a parliamentary hearing. He could not, in short, pledge to secure every job or business. An immediate bounce back is not a given.“Obviously the impact will be severe,” he said. “We are likely to face a severe recession the likes of which we have never seen.”Jobless claims surged by 856,000 in April, to 2.1 million, the highest since 1996 and an increase of 69% from the month before, the Office of National Statistics said Tuesday. The figures covered only the first weeks of the lockdown, said Jonathan Athow, a statistician at the ONS.As bad as it was, economists suggested it could have been much worse. The government created a job retention program to prevent millions of people from being laid off by effectively putting them on the government payroll. Britain’s Treasury said Tuesday that 8 million people have been put on furlough schemes and that a further 2 million self-employed people have applied for income support.“The fact unemployment hasn’t already shot up far higher given the huge fall in GDP and temporary closure of around a quarter of businesses is a good result for the government,” said Andrew Wishart, an economist at Capital Economics. He said that reflects the fact so many people have been furloughed rather than being made redundant.The government wage support scheme is due to ask employers to share costs from August, so job losses could accelerate if employers decide that their businesses can’t survive and give up.Among the sectors hit hardest were hospitality and construction. Job vacancies also dropped sharply, with the number of empty posts falling by 170,000 to 637,000 in the three months to April compared with the previous quarter.The unemployment rate was at 3.9% in March, the last month for which full labor market statistics are available. Experts predict it will rise toward 10% by the fall.Economist Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank said that would mean an increase in the number of unemployed workers to around 3.3 million from about 1.35 million in March — far exceeding the previous peak of 2.7 million in October 2011 in the wake of the financial crisis. Others think it could rise far higher, especially if there is a second peak in the virus.An unemployment rate peak of 10% would still be well below the rate in the U.S., where the jobless rate hit 14.7% already in April and is forecast to rise further.The British government also announced Tuesday it was quadrupling the size of loans available to larger businesses which have been affected by the coronavirus crisis, many of whom have already used the job retention scheme to put workers on furlough.The Treasury said companies will now be able to receive up to 200 million pounds ($245 million) under the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme, from 50 million pounds before. The scheme is available for firms with an annual turnover of more than 45 million pounds.Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chamber of Commerce, said the change “will help ensure that more businesses of all sizes get access to the finance they need to help weather this unprecedented economic storm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unemployment-in-uk-highest-since-1996-severe-recession-likely-says-rishi-sunak/story-USAO9Ik6wsYPQL8bggRT4N.html
19-05-2020||World||Coronavirus threatens ‘years of progress’ on climate issues||The coronavirus pandemic threatens to derail any progress made in recent years to deal with the climate change crisis, organizers of the annual gathering of business and political elites in the Swiss ski resort of Davos said Tuesday.In a survey of industry professionals that reassesses the risks to the global outlook in light of the pandemic, the World Economic Forum said “years of progress” on addressing climate change could be undone and that it is important for countries to make sure environmental issues are at the heart of recovery plans.“We now have a unique opportunity to use this crisis to do things differently and build back better economies that are more sustainable, resilient and inclusive.” said Saadia Zahidi, the WEF’s managing director.The WEF warned that “omitting sustainability criteria in recovery efforts or returning to an emissions-intensive global economy risks hampering the climate resilient low-carbon transition.”At the most recent gathering in Davos in January, climate issues dominated the week’s discussions and many companies, as well as national governments, insisted that dealing with global warming would be central to their programs over the coming years. Spurred on by young climate activists, such as Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate, promises were made to meet the commitments made in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.Since then, though, everything has been upended by the coronavirus, which has forced much of the world to impose unprecedented lockdowns of their societies. The economic damage and the difficulties involved in lifting the restrictions are having a colossal economic impact, with tens of millions of people around the world losing their jobs and many countries facing potentially the deepest recessions since World War II.The nearly 350 senior risk professionals in industries from retail to manufacturing who were surveyed for the report fretted most about the economic impact, with 68% identifying a “prolonged global recession” as most likely over the coming 18 months. A surge in bankruptcies and industry failures also featured highly, as did concern over another COVID-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-threatens-years-of-progress-on-climate-issues/story-4Q6A5eiv7tYfhnX3zJ1H0J.html

Each porcupine or civet, a catlike species previously linked to the sever acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic in the early 2000s, will bring a payout of about 600 yuan (US$84),” it added.Neighbouring Jiangxi province has also released documents on plans to help farmers dispose of animals and financial aid.The state-run Jiangxi Daily newspaper reported last week that the province has more than 2300 licensed breeders, mostly rearing wild animals for food.“Their animals are worth about 1.6 billion yuan ($225 million),” the report, quoted by AFP, said.On February 24, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, or China’s top legislature, adopted a decision on thoroughly banning the illegal trading of wildlife and eliminating the consumption of wild animals to safeguard people’s lives and health.The same week it was announced that the government had stepped up oversight of illegal wildlife trade via e-commerce platforms.“More than 750,000 pieces of information about wildlife trade were removed or blocked from major e-commerce platforms while 17,000 online stores or accounts were closed,” Liang Aifu, an official with the State Administration for Market Regulation, was quoted as saying by the state media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quit-wildlife-trade-get-cash-chinese-provinces-to-farmers-amid-pandemic-pressure/story-ezWUA5lV3owY115Yi4VIhL.html
19-05-2020||World||Man abducted as child in China reunited with parents after 32 years||A Chinese man kidnapped as a toddler 32 years ago has been reunited with his biological parents, after police used facial recognition technology to help track him down.Mao Yin was just two when he was snatched outside a hotel in Xi’an in central Shaanxi province in 1988 and sold to a childless couple in neighbouring Sichuan province who raised him as their own son, Xi’an’s public security bureau said in a statement.Police “aged” one of Mao’s childhood photos, according to state broadcaster CCTV, and used the model to scan the national database and find close matches.They were acting on a tipoff that a person in a certain area of Sichuan had bought a child in the late 80’s.On Monday, the now 34-year-old had a tearful reunion with his birth parents who had never given up the search for their missing boy.Mao’s mother Li Jingzhi told CCTV that after he was taken, she quit her job and sent over 100,000 flyers to officials and appeared on several TV channels to appeal for his return.Over the past three decades, Li had followed 300 false leads to see if they were her missing son.But in late April, police in Xi’an were tipped off that a man in Sichuan province had bought a child from Shaanxi in the late 1980s, according to the statement from Xi’an officials.Police tracked down Mao and later confirmed he was the abducted son of Li Jingzhi after a DNA test.Mao’s adoptive parents had renamed him Gu Ningning, and he grew up without any knowledge of his birth parents or that he had been abducted. At the reunion event, organised by Xi’an police, Mao emerged from a side door to a conference room and ran into his mother’s arms. “I don’t want him to leave me anymore. I won’t let him leave me anymore,” Li said as she held onto her son’s hand. Mao, who runs a home decoration business in Sichuan, told CCTV he would move to Xi’an to live with his birth parents.There are no official statistics on the number of children who disappear every year in China, but a system was established in 2016 to send alerts about missing children through social media and mobile phone texts.Police have helped more than 6,300 abducted children to reunite with their families over the past decade through the DNA matching system, official news agency Xinhua reported.Kidnapping and child trafficking became widespread in China from the 1980s, when the draconian one-child rule was enforced, with a cultural obsession with sons also fuelling demand for kidnapped babies.prw/rox/je/fox||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-abducted-as-child-in-china-reunited-with-parents-after-32-years/story-8QHHt0YFpPoKedOokAzntM.html
19-05-2020||World||China bows to pressure, co-sponsors WHO resolution for Covid-19 probe||The World Health Assembly on Tuesday agreed to an independent probe into the WHO’s response to the Covid-19 outbreak that has come under criticism from several countries, particularly the United States.It asks the WHO director general Tedros Adhanom to have an “impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation” of the international response to the crisis, including a probe of WHO actions and “their timelines pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic”.The resolution, initially drafted by the European Union, was co-sponsored by more than 130 countries.Chinese President Xi Jinping, which had all along been against a probe into the Covid-19 origin or the response, had yesterday underlined that Beijing was all for a comprehensive probe but only after the world had got a grip on the disease that has impacted infected millions.Watch: China agrees for probe on Covid origin, vows $2 billion for WHO But China, which has been accused of concealing information about the disease, had to give up that stance in face of pressure from far too many countries.The United States, which has played a lead role in the campaign against China and the World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom, forced the matter by firing a strongly-worded letter threatening to exit the WHO.US President Donald Trump’s letter, which accused China of hiding crucial information about the disease, was a sharp contrast to the administration’s nominee at the WHA who did not name China through his speech, only referring to Beijing as “one country”.US secretary of health and human services Alex Azar told the World Health Assembly that the pandemic had “spun out of control” in great part due to a costly “failure” by the WHO, and called for a more effective world body.“There was a failure by this organisation to obtain the information that the world needed, and that failure cost many lives,” Alex Azar told the annual assembly.The United States, which had reservations about a portion of the resolution that also backs the right of poor countries to ignore patents to gain access to a Covid-19 vaccine or treatment, also put aside its concerns to back the resolution that echoed its views on the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.Diplomats in Geneva, however, indicate that the final report that emerges at the end of the review of the global response to the outbreak may end up being a balancing act. Since the review would be in consultation with the member states, it is likely that a version which is too harsh would be considered unacceptable by either party, China or the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-bows-to-pressure-co-sponsors-who-resolution-for-covid-19-probe/story-0pP8sOcRVNr3I5sVwHjXYM.html

These incidents come a week after another attack in which six army personnel, including one officer, were killed.Local media reported that a vehicle of the Frontier Corps (FC), a wing of the Pakistan Army, in Mach was targeted using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) which led to six soldiers were killed.In a separate incident at Kech, another soldier, Sipahi Imdad Ali was killed in an exchange of fire with militants.Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari also took to Twitter to condemn the incident. She said that terrorist outfits were coming under “increased pressure” as they were increasingly isolated internationally. She added that “Pakistan continues to make gains in its fight against terrorism”.Earlier this month, five FC soldiers and one officer were martyred after their vehicle was targeted with an IED near the Pakistan-Iran border.In a tweet, the military’s media wing said the security personnel were returning from patrolling in Buleda — 14 kilometres from the Pakistan-Iran border — to “check possible routes used by terrorists in the mountainous terrain of Makran”. As they were returning, their vehicle was targeted with a remote controlled IED, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-pak-soldiers-killed-in-terror-attacks-in-balochistan/story-YGF2Wylh2lwozL9LjxPsbJ.html

It is also the holiest site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount because it was the location of the first and second Jewish temples in antiquity.The site has long been a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and perceived encroachments by Israeli authorities and hard-line Jewish groups have ignited clashes on a number of occasions. Israel says it has no intention of changing the status quo at the site.The site is in east Jerusalem, which Israeli seized in the 1967 war and later annexed in a move not recognized internationally. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state.Israel and the Palestinian Authority imposed sweeping lockdowns in mid-March aimed at containing the virus, limiting travel and public gatherings, and forcing nonessential businesses to close.

And the spokeswoman said: “The European Union backs the WHO in its efforts to contain and mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak and has already provided additional funding to support these efforts.”Not for the first time, this puts Brussels in opposition to Washington, where Trump has accused the UN health agency of being too close to China and of being slow to react to the COVID-19 outbreak.On Monday, the US leader -- who has already frozen US funding for the WHO -- wrote its director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, to lay out the charges and threaten to pull out.“They’re a puppet of China, they’re China-centric to put it nicer,” he explained.Beijing has furiously denied the US allegations that it played down the threat and Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated at the World Health Assembly that his nation had been “transparent” throughout the crisis.Brussels is backing an independent inquiry into how the epidemic erupted and spread, but has tried to lead an international, multilateral response to the crisis and raise funds for vaccine research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-for-solidarity-not-finger-pointing-eu-backs-who-after-trump-pull-out-threat/story-6QVGIo9si2gTGjh2wPTdzO.html

Opposition parties say he was too slow to impose a lockdown, too slow to introduce mass testing and too slow to get enough protective equipment to hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-covid-19-death-toll-nears-43-000-report/story-ZopPtHSdnpqZcgnhRSqsRM.html
19-05-2020||World||Beijing says Donald Trump ‘shirking responsibility’ to WHO||Beijing on Tuesday accused Donald Trump of smearing China and shirking American responsibilities to the World Health Organization, after the US president threatened to pull out of the UN health body.The American leader has been locked in a bitter war of words with Beijing, alleging it covered up the initial outbreak in central China late last year before the disease spread globally, causing economic devastation and claiming lives across the planet.Trump on Monday called the WHO a “puppet of China” before tweeting a letter he had sent to the organisation’s chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus threatening to make permanent a temporary freeze on funding from the US.China in response accused Trump of trying to “smear China” and “shirk responsibility and bargain over its international obligations to the WHO”, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a regular press briefing Tuesday.“The US leader’s open letter you mentioned is full of hints, ‘perhaps’, and ‘maybes’, and tries to use specious methods to mislead the public, and achieve the goals of smearing China’s anti-virus efforts, and shirk responsibility for the United States’ own insufficient response,” Zhao said.“The US tries to use China as an issue to shirk responsibility and bargain over its international obligations to the WHO. This is a miscalculation and the US has picked the wrong target.”More than 317,000 people have died of COVID-19 out of nearly 4.8 million infections worldwide, and governments are scrambling to contain the virus while seeking ways to resuscitate their hammered economies.Zhao added the US was attempting to deflect from its own “insufficient prevention and control” against the virus.With more fatalities and cases in the United States than any other country by far, under-pressure Trump has blamed the WHO for not doing enough to combat its initial spread.“The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China,” Trump’s letter read. China urges the US to “stop shifting the blame” and instead focus on containing the virus, Zhao said at a regular press conference.Earlier Monday the WHO said it would launch an independent review of the response to the coronavirus pandemic, and Chinese President Xi Jinping said China supports a “comprehensive evaluation” of the global response to the pandemic after it has been brought under control.Governments including the US and Australia had previously called for an investigation into the origins of the virus.But Zhao said Tuesday that the draft motion currently under discussion at the World Health Assembly is “completely different from the so-called ‘independent international inquiry’ into the pandemic previously mentioned by Australia”.He added that Australia should be willing to “change its ways” and “completely abandon its political manipulation of the pandemic”.Beijing has furiously denied US allegations that it played down the threat, and Xi reiterated at the WHO’s World Health Assembly on Monday that his nation had been “open, transparent and responsible” during the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-says-donald-trump-shirking-responsibility-to-who/story-Eeic0zIWkoeSRcEkjtcpPM.html
19-05-2020||World||UK government accused of virus testing failures||An influential group of British lawmakers is accusing the government of failing to conduct enough tests for the new coronavirus, saying the lapse helped Covid-19 cut a deadly swath through the country’s nursing homes.The House of Commons’ Science and Technology Committee says that “testing capacity has been inadequate for most of the pandemic so far.” In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, committee chairman Greg Clark said Britain’s testing capacity “drove strategy, rather than strategy driving capacity.” The UK authorities initially sought to trace and test everyone who had been in contact with people infected with the coronavirus. But they abandoned that strategy in mid-March as the number of infections overwhelmed the country’s limited testing capacity.Click here for the full coronavirus coverage Clark, a lawmaker from the governing Conservatives, said that “pivotal” decision meant that nursing home residents and staff were not tested “at a time when the spread of the virus was at its most rampant.” Thousands of nursing home residents have died with Covid-19.The country’s testing capacity has now been scaled up to more than 100,000 tests a day, and the government plans to reintroduce a “test, track and trace” policy as part of plans to control the virus and ease the nationwide lockdown.But the committee also said that “it is not clear that the lessons of the delays to testing have been learned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-government-accused-of-virus-testing-failures/story-snCv5kTWCdu6ivH9kvkhwO.html

But China’s persecution of the Panchen Lama is not unusual,” Pompeo said.He called on the Chinese government to immediately make public the Panchen Lama’s whereabouts and to uphold its own constitution and international commitments to promote religious freedom for all persons.The United States, he said, remains deeply concerned about PRC’s ongoing campaign to eliminate the religious, linguistic and cultural identity of Tibetans, including through the ongoing destruction of communities of worship and learning, such as the Larung Gar and Yachen Gar Buddhist Institutes.Tibetan Buddhists, like members of all faith communities, must be able to select, educate and venerate their religious leaders according to their traditions and without government interference, he said.In 1995, a young Tibetan boy Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was recognised as the 11th Panchen Lama, the second highest spiritual authority in Tibetan Buddhism after the Dalai Lama.However, Nyima disappeared days after, becoming the world’s youngest political prisoner.China, which claims Tibet as its own territory, named another boy Gyaltsen Norbu to the position. He is said to be living under a close surveillance in mainland China.However, the Tibetan Parliament in India, known as the Kashag, continues to recognize Nyima as the sole legitimate holder of his title.India’s Dharamshala is home to the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama as well as the Central Tibetan Administration, often known as the Tibetan government-in-exile.China has grown increasingly wary about who will succeed the 14th Dalai Lama, who lives in India on exile. The current Dalai Lama, who is 84, was designated by high priests as the next Dalai Lama when he was just 2.According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, when the current Dalai Lama passes away, he will reincarnate as another person. China has maintained that it has the authority to appoint the successor to the 14th Dalai Lama, who is loyal to Beijing.While Beijing views the Dalai Lama as a separatist who seeks to split Tibet from China, the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize laureate says he only seeks greater rights for Tibetans, including religious freedom and autonomy.China says Tibet for centuries has been its territory well before the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) took control of the region in 1950.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-calls-on-china-to-immediately-make-public-panchen-lama-s-whereabouts/story-EIhpyyJXMpdE9kfhDeRSpJ.html
19-05-2020||World||In 4-page stinker to Tedros over China link, Trump opens door to walk out of WHO||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to walk out of the World Health Organisation, accusing the Tedros Adhanom-led global health body chief of acting at China’s behest and mismanaging the Covid-19 pandemic in the early stages.“It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world. The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China,” Trump said in a letter to Tedros Adhanom.In his four-page letter, Trump detailed every occasion since December last when, according to the US, the WHO did not act on the available information, made misleading claims or gave the world bad advice.WHEN TRUMP HIT THE EJECT BUTTONThe US quit the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) accusing the UN agency of anti-Israel bias. Donald Trump administration pulled out the US from United Nations Human Rights Council in June 2018 accusing the body of being a “hypocritical and self-serving” besides holding a chronic bias against IsraelThe US has started the process to exit from 2015 Paris climate agreement on grounds that staying in the global pact hurts the United States’ economic competitiveness. Trump announced his intention to exit the pact in 2017Donald Trump set a October 2019 deadline to exit the Universal Postal Union over postal rates but stayed put after the organisation arrived at a last-minute compromise last year.Trump gave Tedros Adhanom 30 days to commit to major substantive improvements, warning that if the WHO doesn’t deliver on this, “I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the WHO permanent and reconsider our membership”.Trump’s letter was sent hours after the WHO’s policy making body began its meeting on Monday. At this meeting, China, which had opposed a probe into the origin of the virus that has killed nearly 3.2 lakh people and infected millions across the world, was forced to back down. The formal resolution is expected to be passed today.Trump’s letter did not spell out the improvements or reforms that he was looking for. “My administration has already started discussions with you on how to reform the organisation,” he wrote.Also Read: ‘The only way forward for WHO is...’: Full text of Trump’s letter to WHO chiefDiplomats in Washington and Geneva told Hindustan Times that Trump’s letter, which had put the WHO chief on notice, appeared to be prepping the ground for a possible exit from the WHO. Watch: Donald Trump threatens to permanently halt funding to WHOIt is argued that the WHO could not carry out any substantive reforms in a rush. The WHA, which has representatives of 194-member nations, is meeting over video conference for a truncated session that is to end in a few hours.“Any major reform, like the one the US President appears to be looking for, can only be made with the approval of the general body, the WHA,” a diplomat said.To be sure, this isn’t the first time that the Trump administration has spoken about walking out of the UN’s health body. But the letter to the WHO boss makes the threat formal.Donald Trump does have a track record of pulling the United States out of international agreements and organisations when he doesn’t get his way. Trump has already led the US out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Human Rights Council and last year, came close to backing out of the Universal Postal Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-puts-who-s-tedros-on-notice-over-covid-19-says-might-exit-who/story-SgDkcaXGzeLNQop2zlKtEN.html

We also call on all the G20 leaders to honour existing global health commitments,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kailash-satyarthi-among-88-noble-laureates-leaders-call-for-usd-1-tn-to-protect-children-amid-covid-19/story-eV3QcMMeATcZ4KN5kOCbTN.html
19-05-2020||World||Massive coincidence? Study says coronavirus adapted too quickly to humans, raises questions on its origin||The novel coronavirus is ideally suited to infect human cells rather than animal ones, a new study by researchers in Australia claims, raising questions about the origin of the virus, which has until Tuesday killed over 3.18 lakh people and infected more than 4.8 million globally.Using an “in silico” or computer simulation method, the researchers found that the data generated indicated “… SARSCoV2 is uniquely adapted to infect humans, raising questions as to whether it arose in nature by a rare chance event or whether its origins lie elsewhere”.A team of four researchers, including two trained in India, tested the binding affinity of Covid-19 virus’ “spike protein” to humans and several animals including pangolins.Also read: 4,970 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours push India’s tally past 1 lakh-mark“Notably, SARSCoV2 spike protein had the highest overall binding energy for human ACE2 (a receptor on cells), greater than all the other tested species including bat, the postulated source of the virus. This indicates that SARSCoV2 is a highly adapted human pathogen,” the study found.The study is yet to be peer-reviewed and is now available on the prestigious US-based Cornell University’s pre-print server.An independent expert spoke to HT and said the research was plausible but the evidence put out to support it was thin.China has consistently cited international research to deny that the virus originated in a high-security biology lab in Wuhan Institute of Virology. The central Chinese city of Wuhan is where the Covid-19 disease broke out late last year.Also read: Covid-19 response, China’s offer of help - All about day 1 of WHO sessionThe four researchers of the paper, however, were surprised at the rapid rate at which the virus adapted to humans. “Normally a virus will bind tightly to the cells of its normal host species and less tightly to cells of species it has not infected before. The surprise with Covid-19 is that we found that it bound tightest to human cells than any other species we tested. This is either a massive coincidence or Covid-19 has somehow, in the past, been adapted for human cells. One way in which this can happen is via culture with human cells in a lab,” lead researcher Nikolai Petrovsky, a clinician and vaccinologist, told HT over email.The other researchers involved are Sakshi Piplani and Puneet Singh - both are bioinformatics scientist originally trained in India - and David Winkler, a professor of biochemistry and genetics.Piplani and Petrovsky are affiliated to the Flinders University in Australia. Singh is with Vaxine Pty and Winkler is affiliated to the La Trobe University.“Yes, this virus looks and behaves as if it is perfectly adapted to humans. That is a surprise for a virus that has apparently just entered humans for the first time,” Petrovsky said.He added that zoonotic events, where pathogens jump from animal to human are not rare and have been regularly witnessed in diseases like Ebola, bird flu, MERS etc.“What is rare is to not find any animal source of the virus. For example, for MERS it was rapidly identified to be coming from camels, SARS from bats via civet cats, Ebola from bats via monkeys. So far, no animal source has been found for Covid-19 – this may still be found, but its absence allows other possibilities to be considered.”Not everyone, like Richard H Ebright, from the department of chemistry and chemical biology at the US’s Rutgers University is fully convinced.“The conclusion of the paper that the virus was ‘pre-adapted for human transmission’ is consistent with the scenario of lab ‘gain-of-function’ research followed by a lab accident,” Ebright told HT over email.“Gain-of-function” is a scientific research term, which means accelerating research that improves the ability of a pathogen to cause disease.However, the evidence for that kind of an incident in a lab is thin in the paper, Ebright added.“However, the evidence for the conclusion of the paper that the virus was ‘pre-adapted for human transmission’ is thin,” he said.Petrovsky said their study shows the need to carry out more research into the origins of the coronavirus.“Of course, we know there were institutes in Wuhan that were researching bat and pangolin coronaviruses to which Covid-19 is most closely related, with genetic elements from both. It is certainly possible that if both viruses ended up in a cell culture together, which is not unheard of in a lab due to cross-contamination, then a new variant virus could be created just as it does in an animal that is infected by two viruses at the same time,” he said.“Both scenarios are equally possible, hence the need to do further investigation to see if either of these is the most likely explanation.”The need for further investigation is also emphasised in the research paper.“Given the seriousness of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is imperative that all efforts be made to identify the original source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.”The researchers added: “In particular, it will be important to establish whether Covid-19 is due to a completely natural chance occurrence where a presumed bat virus was transmitted to humans via an intermediate animal host or whether Covid-19 has alternative origins. This information will be of paramount importance to help prevent any similar human coronavirus outbreak in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-massive-coincidence-study-says-coronavirus-adapted-too-quickly-to-humans-raises-questions-on-its-origin/story-4yHc2Tz1t8AJqJMGAZKG8O.html

While the warning does not name China, it follows that from American agencies which were explicit in naming it.A statement in this regard was issued jointly by Canada’s Communications Security Establishment or CSE and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).CSIS pointed to “an increased risk of foreign interference and espionage.” It noted it is working with such potentially vulnerable organisations “to ensure that their work and proprietary information remains safely in their control. Its focus is on protecting Canadian intellectual property from these threats.”The Communications Security Establishment assessed that it was “near-certain that state-sponsored actors have shifted their focus during the pandemic and that Canadian intellectual property represents a valuable target,” according to the statement.“With regards to the specific threats, the Cyber Centre has assessed that the Covid-19 pandemic presents an elevated level of risk to the cybersecurity of Canadian health organizations involved in the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic,” the statement added.Also read: ‘The only way forward for WHO is...’ - Full text of Trump’s letter to WHO chiefIt also underscored coordination with the United States in the effort to safeguard intellectual property related to coronavirus research and development activity, as the statement said, “We regularly share information with our partners, including the US, which has a significant impact on protecting our respective countries’ safety and security.”This statement comes in the wake of that issued by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in America. The US has openly named China and its agencies as being the attempts to steal such critical research at this time.The Canadian statement comes after the CSE had issued a public alert in March in which it had warned that such attempts at piracy of proprietary knowledge was to be expected, as it said then: “These actors may attempt to gain intelligence on Covid-19 response efforts and potential political responses to the crisis or to steal ongoing key research towards a vaccine or other medical remedies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/increased-risk-of-foreign-interference-and-espionage-canada-warns-of-threat-to-its-covid-19-effort/story-EwH6gDhIUlCiQhzekI7sBP.html

19-05-2020||World||‘The only way forward for WHO is...’: Full text of Trump’s letter to WHO chief||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday took to Twitter and shared the four-page long letter that he has written to World Health Organisation (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. In his tweet, Trump said that the letter is “self-explanatory”. Time and again, the US president has accused the global health body for supporting China during the coronavirus pandemic.“The WHO failed to independently investigate credible reports that conflicted directly with the Chinese government’s official accounts, even those that came from sources within Wuhan itself,” Trump’s letter read.Trump said that the WHO “consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December” and concluded his letter by saying that “the only way forward for the WHO is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China.”This is the letter sent to Dr. Tedros of the World Health Organization. It is self-explanatory! pic.twitter.com/pF2kzPUpDvHere’s the full transcript of the Trump’s letter to the WHO chief:Dear Dr. Tedros:On April 14, 2020, I suspended United States contributions to the World Health Organization pending an investigation by my Administration of the organization’s failed response to the COVID-19 outbreak. This review has confirmed many of the serious concerns I raised last month and identified others that the World Health Organization should have addressed, especially the World Health Organization’s alarming lack of independence from the People’s Republic of China. Based on this review, we now know the following:•The World Health Organization consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019 or even earlier, including reports from the Lancet medical journal. The World Health Organization failed to independently investigate credible reports that conflicted directly with the Chinese government’s official accounts, even those that came from sources within Wuhan itself.• By no later than December 30, 2019, the World Health Organization office in Beijing knew that there was a “major public health” concern in Wuhan. Between December 26 and December 30, China’s media highlighted evidence of a new virus emerging from Wuhan, based on patient data sent to multiple Chinese genomics companies. Additionally, during this period, Dr. Zhang Jixian, a doctor from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, told China’s health authorities that a new coronavirus was causing a novel disease that was, at the time, afflicting approximately 180 patients.• By the next day, Taiwanese authorities had communicated information to the World Health Organization indicating human-to-human transmission of a new virus. Yet the World Health Organization chose not to share any of this critical information with the rest of the world, probably for political reasons.• The International Health Regulations require countries to report the risk of a health emergency within 24 hours. But China did not inform the World Health Organization of Wuhan’s several cases of pneumonia, of unknown origin, until December 31, 2019, even though it likely had knowledge of these cases days or weeks earlier.• According to Dr. Zhang Yongzhen of the Shanghai Public Health Clinic Center, he told Chinese authorities on January 5, 2020, that he had sequenced the genome of the virus. There was no publication of this information until six days later, on January 11, 2020, when Dr. Zhang self-posted it online. The next day, Chinese authorities closed his lab for “rectification.” As even the World Health Organization acknowledged, Dr. Zhang’s posting was a great act of “transparency.” But the World Health Organization has been conspicuously silent both with respect to the closure of Dr. Zhang’s lab and his assertion that he had notified Chinese authorities of his breakthrough six days earlier.• The World Health Organization has repeatedly made claims about the coronavirus that were either grossly inaccurate or misleading.- On January 14, 2020, the World Health Organization gratuitously reaffirmed China’s now-debunked claim that the coronavirus could not be transmitted between humans, stating: “Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) identified in Wuhan, China.” This assertion was in direct conflict with censored reports from Wuhan.- On January 21, 2020, President Xi Jinping of China reportedly pressured you not to declare the coronavirus outbreak an emergency. You gave in to this pressure the next day and told the world that the coronavirus did not pose a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Just over one week later, on January 30, 2020, overwhelming evidence to the contrary forced you to reverse course.- On January 28, 2020, after meeting with President Xi in Beijing, you praised the Chinese government for its “transparency” with respect to the coronavirus, announcing that China had set a “new standard for outbreak control” and “bought the world time.” You did not mention that China had, by then, silenced or punished several doctors for speaking out about the virus and restricted Chinese institutions from publishing information about it.• Even after you belatedly declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020, you failed to press China for the timely admittance of a World Health Organization team of international medical experts. As a result, this critical team did not arrive in China until two weeks later, on February 16, 2020. And even then, the team was not allowed to visit Wuhan until the final days of their visit. Remarkably, the World Health Organization was silent when China denied the two American members of the team access to Wuhan entirely.• You also strongly praised China’s strict domestic travel restrictions, but were inexplicably against my closing of the United States border, or the ban, with respect to people coming from China. I put the ban in place regardless of your wishes. Your political gamesmanship on this issue was deadly, as other governments, relying on your comments, delayed imposing life-saving restrictions on travel to and from China. Incredibly, on February 3, 2020, you reinforced your position, opining that because China was doing such a great job protecting the world from the virus, travel restrictions were “causing more harm than good.” Yet by then the world knew that, before locking down Wuhan, Chinese authorities had allowed more than five million people to leave the city and that many of these people were bound for international destinations all over the world.• As of February 3, 2020, China was strongly pressuring countries to lift or forestall travel restrictions. This pressure campaign was bolstered by your incorrect statements on that day telling the world that the spread of the virus outside of China was “minimal and slow” and that “the chances of getting this going to anywhere outside China [were] very low.”• On March 3, 2020, the World Health Organization cited official Chinese data to downplay the very serious risk of asymptomatic spread, telling the world that “COVID-19 does not transmit as efficiently as influenza” and that unlike influenza this disease was not primarily driven by “people who are infected but not yet sick.” China’s evidence, the World Health Organization told the world, “showed that only one percent of reported cases do not have symptoms, and most of those cases develop symptoms within two days.” Many experts, however, citing data from Japan, South Korea, and elsewhere, vigorously questioned these assertions. It is now clear that China’s assertions, repeated to the world by the World Health Organization, were wildly inaccurate.• By the time you finally declared the virus a pandemic on March 11, 2020, it had killed more than 4,000 people and infected more than 100,000 people in at least 114 countries around the world.• On April 11, 2020, several African Ambassadors wrote to the Chinese Foreign Ministry about the discriminatory treatment of Africans related to the pandemic in Guangzhou and other cities in China. You were aware that Chinese authorities were carrying out a campaign of forced quarantines, evictions, and refusal of services against the nationals of these countries. You have not commented on China’s racially discriminatory actions. You have, however, baselessly labeled as racist Taiwan’s well-founded complaints about your mishandling of this pandemic.• Throughout this crisis, the World Health Organization has been curiously insistent on praising China for its alleged “transparency.” You have consistently joined in these tributes, notwithstanding that China has been anything but transparent. In early January, for example, China ordered samples of the virus to be destroyed, depriving the world of critical information. Even now, China continues to undermine the International Health Regulations by refusing to share accurate and timely data, viral samples and isolates, and by withholding vital information about the virus and its origins. And, to this day, China continues to deny international access to their scientists and relevant facilities, all while casting blame widely and recklessly and censoring its own experts.• The World Health Organization has failed to publicly call on China to allow for an independent investigation into the origins of the virus, despite the recent endorsement for doing so by its own Emergency Committee. The World Health Organization’s failure to do so has prompted World Health Organization member states to adopt the “COVID-19 Response” Resolution at this year’s World Health Assembly, which echoes the call by the United States and so many others for an impartial, independent, and comprehensive review of how the World Health Organization handled the crisis. The resolution also calls for an investigation into the origins of the virus, which is necessary for the world to understand how best to counter the disease.Perhaps worse than all these failings is that we know that the World Health Organization could have done so much better. Just a few years ago, under the direction of a different Director-General, the World Health Organization showed the world how much it has to offer. In 2003, in response to the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China, Director-General Harlem Brundtland boldly declared the World Health Organization’s first emergency travel advisory in 55 years, recommending against travel to and from the disease epicenter in southern China. She also did not hesitate to criticize China for endangering global health by attempting to cover up the outbreak through its usual playbook of arresting whistleblowers and censoring media. Many lives could have been saved had you followed Dr. Brundtland’s example.It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world. The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China. My Administration has already started discussions with you on how to reform the organization. But action is needed quickly. We do not have time to waste. That is why it is my duty, as President of the United States, to inform you that, if the World Health Organization does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership in the organization. I cannot allow American taxpayer dollars to continue to finance an organization that, in its present state, is so clearly not serving America’s interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-only-way-forward-for-the-who-is-full-text-of-trump-s-letter-to-who-chief-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus/story-MCee8MiYg9NYh7gPcYMGRO.html

The data comes from eight people who took part in a 45-subject safety trial that kicked off in March. The Moderna vaccine is one of more than 100 under development intended to protect against Sars-CoV-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19. Overall, the study showed the vaccine was safe and all study participants produced antibodies against the virus.“These are significant findings but it is a Phase 1 clinical trial that only included eight people. It was designed for safety. Not for efficacy,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, in infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who was not involved in the study.The very early data offers a glimmer of hope for a vaccine among the most advanced in development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-developers-report-first-positive-sign-in-human-trial/story-FsuAwE2dscboq65orUBZcL.html

The world was “paying a heavy price” for the sometimes contradictory strategies, he added.China offers helpChinese President Xi Jinping voiced support for a joint approach, vowing in his address to make any vaccine his country developed available for all.A WHA resolution tabled by the European Union calls for an impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation of the international response to the coronavirus crisis.US health secretary Alex Azar called for an independent review of “every aspect” of the UN health agency’s response to the pandemic.While Tedros welcomed that call, he stressed there was no need to dramatically overhaul the WHO. Tedros said that the immediate need was to strengthen, implement and finance the systems and organisations, including the WHO.Despite swelling tensions, countries hope to adopt a resolution by consensus.Taiwan decision delayedMember states steered clear of a controversial discussion on whether to grant Taiwan observer status, a move vehemently opposed by Beijing, which considers the island part of its territory.Nearly 15 states, including Belize, Guatemala and Honduras, wanted the question of Taiwan’s participation to be added to the WHA agenda.Washington has also been increasingly vocal, with demands that Taiwan be allowed in as an observer.But amid fears the row would overshadow the global health body’s work to address the Covid-19 crisis, members unanimously agreed Monday to postpone the discussion until later in the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-response-china-s-offer-of-help-highlights-of-the-first-day-of-key-who-session/story-8DAHGjtqaL3EFfzH5hXQYK.html
19-05-2020||World||Taking anti-malaria drug HCQ to protect against Covid-19: Trump||US President Donald Trump on Monday announced he has been taking the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine along with a zinc supplement he has touted as a game-changer in the battle against Covid-19 despite warnings of fatal side-effects issued by his own drug regulator, backed since by studies.“You’d be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the front-line workers, before you catch it. The front-line workers -- many, many are taking it. I happen to be taking it. I happen to be taking it -- Hydroxychloroquine,” Trump told reporters unprompted at a roundtable with restaurant owners, who have been hit the hardest as a sector.“I was just waiting to see your eyes light up when I said this,” he added, addressing the effect of his stunning announcement on reporters and the country. Trump said he feels fine, has no symptoms and has tested negative repeatedly. He is using the drug combination as a prophylactic, he said, like “many frontline” health workers and doctors. He was not prescribed the drug combination by the White House physician, he clarified, but was given the go-ahead when he checked with him.Commander Sean Conley, the president’s physician from US Navy, said in a statement that after a member of the president’s staff tested positive for Covid-19 two weeks ago — the valet — he and Trump had numerous discussions regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine and “we concluded the potential benefit from treatment (using the drug) outweighed the relative risks”.Commander Conley added that he continues to monitor studies and reports about the use of the antimalarial drug and in consultation with public health officials and experts he anticipates “employing the same shared medical decision-making based on the evidence at hand in the future”.The US Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency-use authorization for hydroxychloroquine for clinical trial and to be administered to patients under close supervision of physicians it as also warned of side-effects such as “potentially life-threatening heart rhythm problems”.The drug’s side-effects have been corroborated in an increasing number of studies in the United States and abroad.Cardiac arrest was found to be a key side-effect in a large observational study of the use of the antimalarial drug in combination with the antibiotic among more than 1,400 Covid-19 patients in New York hospital, according to an announcement by University of Albany researchers last week. By itself, hydroxychloroquine had no side-effects. But the drugs, in combination or separately, were found to have had no significant benefits.This was the largest study yet of the drug’s safety and efficacy for treating Covid-19 patients, but it was observational. Results of randomized clinical trial, the gold standard for drugs, is awaited.President Trump had noticeably stopped touting the drug around the time, but it appears he had been using it already by then, convinced by what, as he said Monday, he was hearing from hundreds of doctors and people.The president is leery of studies and analyses that question the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and its earlier avatar chloroquine. And on Monday, he dissed an earlier study of patients conducted by the Department of Veteran Affairs, telling reporters it was conducted among very ill patients, suggesting, therefore, it was not tried as a preventative, which is how he has been using it.President Trump began promoting the drug as a “game-changer” mid -March when Covid-19 had begun to take a heavy toll on the country with spiking infections and fatalities. Experts of the White House task force would shortly say they feared the virus could kill 100,000 to 240,000 Americans.Two weeks later, President Trump called Prime Minister Narendra Modi to request him to allow a large US order of hydroxychloroquine to go through. India, a leading manufacturer of medicines and supplier of 40% of over-the-counter drugs in the US, had banned the export of more than two dozen drugs at the time to protect and preserve its supplies from China’s predatory shopping spree driven by its panicky response to growing global outrage over its failure to contain and kill the epidemic that started on its soil in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-he-is-taking-antimalarial-drug-hcq-as-prophylactic-against-covid-19/story-xKKUYsHovzQByntRr8lACP.html

The measures will be effective from May 19.Australia has fueled tensions with China in recent weeks by calling for an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, with a focus on wildlife wet markets. Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said on Sunday that the country would challenge any duties imposed by China in the World Trade Organization. Barley exports to China were worth A$1.4 billion ($898 million) in 2017.China’s embassy in Canberra has warned its citizens might be offended by Australia’s behavior and choose to travel to alternative destinations and send their children to universities in other countries — threatening Australia’s two key service exports.Meat imports from four Australian processing plants have also been suspended by China. However, the Chinese government has denied any link to the call for a probe into the virus, describing the ban as a health and safety issue.“China never says it’s retaliation, but China does have a history of using agricultural trade as a political lever, going back at least 10 years,” Tim Hunt, Rabobank’s head of food and agribusiness research for Australia, said earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-slaps-anti-dumping-duty-on-australian-barley-for-5-years/story-Zyu9SOSoDmRTH3FKCcZFvN.html

Plans are being crafted to slash this because “we’re not treated right.”“They gave us a lot of bad advice,” he said of the WHO.Trump spoke as the WHO held its first annual assembly since the pandemic swept the world after originating in China, causing massive economic disruption and killing 316,000 people -- close to a third of them in the United States.Trump said China only pays about $40 million a year and one idea was for Washington to bring “our 450 down to 40,” but “some people thought that was too much.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-calls-who-puppet-of-china-says-us-may-cut-funds-to-world-health-body/story-FiFQJkinhD8pVNQzuHpqvM.html

The first woman to hold the top job in India House was Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, from 1954 to 1961. For 57 years, London waited for another woman high commissioner, and then two come along. Ghanashyam is to be succeeded by Gaitri Issar Kumar, ambassador in Belgium.Ghanashyam’s short term was busy: General elections were held in India and the UK, besides prolonged debates over Brexit with hopes of a free trade deal with India, and now the coronavirus pandemic that left thousands of Indians stranded in the UK.Speaking to members of the Indian Journalists Association (established May 1947) by video-link, Ghanashyam said: “There was never a dull moment. We came across many challenges but they could be addressed with the help of our large diaspora”.The attack on the mission on August 15, 2019, when a large crowd protesting against changes made by New Delhi in the federal structure of Jammu and Kashmir, was a “traumatic experience” for her, when additional police were called to rescue people trapped.“The situation could have been more traumatic, but we managed to get the Indians who had come to celebrate Independence Day into the building”, she said, recalling events of the day, that snowballed into a diplomatic row between the two countries.Ghanashyam also made headlines for “jhadu diplomacy”, for taking up the broom and mop to clean sections of the heritage building and the pavement in the Strand that were sullied by eggs and projectiles hurled by protestors on September 3.It has been possible to deal with the challenge of dealing with thousands of stranded Indians, she said, due to the large diaspora. Many individuals and groups across the UK came forward to arrange their stay and extended medical and other assistance.“People here have been very welcoming, shows how well the person who holds the office of Indian high commissioner is regarded. There are multiple aspects of our engagement with the UK, but our biggest strength is the large diaspora”, she said.Ghanashyam’s predecessor, Y K Sinha, was appointed information commissioner in New Delhi after retiring. After a career in diplomacy, Ghanashyam remained diplomatically silent as journalists mentioned the possibility of a new assignment beckoning her back home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-envoy-to-uk-retires-after-a-roller-coaster-ride/story-GiLieoRLewGomckNWwKdXL.html
19-05-2020||World||Trump says he is taking antimalarial drug HCQ as prophylactic against Covid-19||President Donald Trump said Monday that he is taking a malaria drug to protect against the new coronavirus, despite warnings from his own government that it should only be administered for Covid-19 in a hospital or research setting due to potentially fatal side effects.Trump told reporters he has been taking the drug, hydroxychloroquine, and a zinc supplement daily “for about a week and a half now.” Trump spent weeks pushing the drug as a potential cure or prophylaxis for Covid-19 against the cautionary advice of many of his administration’s top medical professionals. The drug has the potential to cause significant side effects in some patients and has not been shown to combat the new coronavirus.Trump said his doctor did not recommend the drug to him, but he requested it from the White House physician.“I started taking it, because I think it’s good,” Trump said. “I’ve heard a lot of good stories.”The Food and Drug Administration warned health professionals last month that the drug should not be used to treat Covid-19 outside of hospital or research settings, due to sometimes fatal side effects. Regulators issued the alert for the drug, which can also be used to treat lupus and arthritis, after receiving reports of heart-rhythm problems, including deaths, from poison control centers and other health providers.Trump dismissed reports of side effects, saying, “All I can tell you is, so far I seem to be OK.”At least two White House staffers tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this month, sparking concerns about the steps taken by the administration to protect the president and sending Vice President Mike Pence and other officials into varying forms of self-isolation.The White House has since mandated that those in the West Wing wear face coverings and has introduced daily testing for the virus for the president, vice president and those they come in close contact with.Trump last underwent an “interim” checkup in a November visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center that was not noted on his public schedule. His last complete physical took place in February 2019.Trump has repeatedly pushed the use of the drug with or without the antibiotic azithromycin, but no large, rigorous studies have found them safe or effective for preventing or treating Covid-19.Two large observational studies, each involving around 1,400 patients in New York, recently found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine. Two new ones published Thursday in the medical journal BMJ reached the same conclusion.One, by French researchers, gave 84 hospitalized patients the drug and 97 others the usual care. There were no differences in the odds of death, need for intensive care or developing severe illness.The other study from China was a stricter test: 150 adults hospitalized with mild or moderate illness were randomly assigned to get hydroxychloroquine or usual care. The drug made no difference in rates of clearing the virus or time to relief of symptoms, and they brought more side effects.In April, the National Institutes of Health launched a study testing hydroxychloroquine versus a placebo drug in 500 hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Last week, NIH announced another study to see if hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin can prevent hospitalization or death in people with mild to moderate illness. About 2,000 U.S. adults with confirmed coronavirus infections and symptoms such as fever, cough or shortness of breath will get the drugs or placebo pills.U.S. prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine surged roughly 80% in March to more than 830,000 compared with same period in the prior year, according to data tracking firm IQVIA. That jump in prescribing came before the federal government accepted nearly 30 million doses of the drug donated to the strategic national stockpile by foreign drugmakers. Since then, millions of those tablets have been shipped to U.S. hospitals nationwide for use treating patients with Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-s-taking-malaria-drug-to-protect-against-covid-19-for-over-a-week/story-WC9fpVcV5XIGYU7FxQJM0H.html
19-05-2020||World||Profile: WHO chief Tedros unbowed amid attacks, Trump criticism||The World Health Organization’s director-general has faced many challenges during the coronavirus pandemic: racial slurs, death threats, social media caricatures — he was once depicted as a ventriloquist’s dummy in the hands of Chinese President Xi Jinping — and US funding cuts.Through it all, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has endeavored to rise above the troubles with a focus on one main task: Building international “solidarity” against an outbreak whose confirmed death toll is nearly 300,000 and that quelled economic activity in countries rich and poor. Many health policy experts have praised his handling of the outbreak overall, despite criticism of the UN health agency by the Trump administration.Next week, Tedros’ track record and background will come under intensified scrutiny as WHO holds its biggest annual event — the World Health Assembly — in a “virtual” and abbreviated version that focuses on Covid-19.Critics and some analysts cite his background as a government minister in Ethiopia, with its history of authoritarian regimes. Not long after taking office in 2017, Tedros appointed Zimbabwe’s then president, Robert Mugabe, who often traveled abroad to receive health care, as a WHO “goodwill ambassador,” only to revoke the appointment after a wave of outrage erupted.Most recently, Trump has faulted WHO for being too accepting and praising of China’s handling of the early outbreak, wedging Tedros personally in the tense political standoff between the US and China. He has shied away from criticizing the two powerful UN members, and has praised both President Donald Trump and Xi — even while leaving hints seemingly directed at Beijing and Washington.“Don’t use this virus as an opportunity to fight against each other or score political points. It’s dangerous,” he said recently, appealing to the world. “It’s the political problem that may fuel further this pandemic.”Tedros, 55, knows about the punishing sides to both politics and pandemics: A malaria expert with a doctorate in microbiology from the University of Nottingham in Britain, he served as health minister and foreign minister in Ethiopia before his election in 2017 in one of WHO’s most competitive races.He’s the first WHO chief from Africa, and the first who doesn’t have a medical degree — seen as a hole in his resume by some critics.Tedros was born in the city of Asmara, before it and the rest of Eritrea split from Ethiopia. Like many Ethiopians, he goes by his first name. A father of five, he has tweeted about riding bikes with his daughter. A few years ago, he tried out the saxophone, but give it up because of a heavy workload.Years ago, Tedros was spotted as a rising star of health policy by Melinda Gates, whose charitable foundation has become WHO’s No. 2 donor. He has been credited for helping expand Ethiopia’s health care workforce as health minister from 2005 to 2012.Tedros often uses wit, feigned ignorance and charm to disarm or sidestep critics. He has drawn on the star power of Lady Gaga and garnered support from European leaders, and called Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez “mi hermano”: my brother. He bills himself “Dr. Tedros,” leaning on his doctorate, and actively tweets to a million followers.No stranger to the personal anecdote, Tedros once said it was “pure luck” for him to aspire to the top WHO job, noting that when he was 7, his younger brother died from a childhood disease — and it could just as easily have been him.Dr. Lia Tadesse, Ethiopia’s current health minister, who worked with Tedros when he had her job, said he was known for showing calm, patience and a good ear.“While he was a minister, he was known to really care for people who are considered at the lowest level of the strata, like the cleaner, the security guard and so on,” she said by phone. “He takes time to listen to their problems, and really recognize their efforts.”Tedros has played down death threats against him, but has stood up to defend Africa. He has blasted the government of Taiwan, which isn’t a UN member state, for allegedly condoning “racial slurs” against him. Taiwan’s current government has faced intense political pressure from rival China, and has been appealing for admission as an observer to the World Health Assembly on Monday and Tuesday.Political sniping between the US and China, and Tedros’ own political baggage, can make it tough to cut through the noise during a global health emergency.“If you criticize the WHO and Tedros, you’re somehow seen as a supporter of the Trump administration and their clearly self-serving attacks to shift blame from their own failure,” said Jeffrey Smith, director of Washington-based Vanguard Africa, a promoter of democracy. “On the other hand, if you defend Dr. Tedros and the WHO, you’re seen as somehow endorsing his comfort level with the world’s despots and dictators.”“Yes, Dr. Tedros is the product of a deeply authoritarian regime. And he has long displayed an affinity for dictators,” Smith said. “The WHO does critical work and deserves support. And yes, the WHO also needs reform. All of these things can be true.”David Shinn, a US ambassador to Ethiopia in the 1990s, said Tedros had a good relationship with both Beijing and Washington while Ethiopia’s foreign minister. Shinn cited a “cautionary note:” Tedros had the job when Ethiopia relied heavily on China for economic and political support, as it does today.“As a result, he probably was willing to accept at face value what he was being told by China with perhaps not questioning as strongly as he might have what the situation really was,” said Shinn, an adjunct professor at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs.Tedros appears to have learned one key thing from his predecessor, Dr. Margaret Chan of China: Be reactive to outbreaks. Amid the Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo that’s now seemingly on its last legs, Tedros traveled over a dozen times to the region. With Covid-19, he has been omnipresent.“Dr. Tedros has been very much at the helm in terms of being in almost every single press conference, communicating directly with the public, tweeting — really speaking directly to people,” said Suerie Moon, co-director of the Global Health Center at Geneva’s Graduate Institute.“He’s able to really humanize a situation that’s quite frightening for most people and be a reassuring presence,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-tedros-unbowed-amid-attacks-trump-criticism/story-AIOE0lzGPPDCGJunXLFopN.html
