Her daughter told Spanish news agency EFE that her mother, who was born in the United States, tested positive for the virus in April.“As far as my health, I feel good, with the little issues everyone has as we get older, but I feel fine,” Branyas told EFE this week from her nursing home where several residents have fallen ill and died from the new virus.Local media say at least 17 residents of her nursing home are suspected to have died after developing symptoms associated with COVID-19. On March 27, Branyas’ social media account run by her children said that “unfortunately the virus has entered our residence.”Branyas was born in San Francisco on March 4, 1907 after her family emigrated to Mexico and then the U.S., as her children recount in a Twitter account run in her name called “Super Catalan Grandmother.”After living for some years in New Orleans where her father founded a magazine, she returned to Spain’s northeastern Catalonia region where she lives in the town of Olot.Branyas still has memories of crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a boat during World War I, as she related to Catalan news agency ACN on her birthday in March.“Because of the war, Germany was still attacking in the north, and there was no way of going through the Nordic seas, so you had to go further south, via Cuba and the Azores,” she said.Despite her poor hearing and sight, Branyas said she was aware of the pandemic that has claimed over 27,000 lives in Spain.“It is a tragedy,” she said, “since only a few people seem to know where it came from, how it got here and why.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/113-year-old-spanish-woman-overcomes-coronavirus-infection/story-4mdnCb8a26ZZXToUxVmvnM.html

15-05-2020||World||US on track to pull troops from Afghanistan despite turmoil||The United States is on track to meet its commitment to the Taliban to withdraw several thousand troops from Afghanistan by summer, even as violence flares, the peace process is stalled, and Kabul struggles in political deadlock.U.S. officials say they will reduce to 8,600 troops by July 15 and abandon five bases. And by next spring all foreign forces are suppose to withdraw, ending America’s longest war. Yet the outlook for peace is cloudy at best. In the absence of Afghan peace talks, the Trump administration may face the prospect of fully withdrawing even as the Taliban remains at war with the government.That has concerned some lawmakers, including Rep. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican and member of the House Armed Services Committee. She says the United States needs to keep a military and intelligence presence in Afghanistan to prevent extremist groups like al-Qaida and the Islamic State’s Afghan affiliate from forming havens from which to attack the U.S.“Withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan won’t end the war — it will just let the terrorists win,” she told The Associated Press.Some question whether the U.S.-Taliban agreement signed in Doha, Qatar, on Feb. 29, which the Trump administration billed as “a decisive step to achieve a negotiated peace,” was instead mainly a withdrawal agreement. President Donald Trump had campaigned on bringing troops home from foreign wars. And though the Afghan government publicly supported the deal, it did not participate directly in the negotiations and has not, in Washington’s view, capitalized on the chance for peace talks.“President Trump promised to bring our troops home from overseas and is following through on that promise,” the White House said when the Doha deal was signed.The deal stipulated that the Taliban would start intra-Afghan peace negotiations on March 10, but that has not happened. The Taliban and the Afghan government also have squabbled over a promised release of each other’s prisoners.“A lot of this boils down to: Was the U.S.-Taliban agreement any kind of serious negotiation at all, or was it just totally a fig leaf to cover abject withdrawal? I suspect the latter,” said Stephen Biddle, a Columbia University professor of international and public affairs and a former adviser to U.S. commanders in Kabul.“It gave away almost all the leverage we had in exchange for virtually nothing,” he added. “It looks very much like a situation in which the Taliban have concluded that the Americans are out, and they’re going to play out the string and see what happens when we’re gone.”The United States has been the prime backer of the Afghan government since it invaded the country soon after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and overthrew the Taliban, which was running the country and harboring al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. According to U.S. government auditors, Washington has committed $86 billion to support Afghan security forces and is still spending about $4 billion a year.The Trump administration has expressed frustration with the lack of movement toward peace talks, but it has not threatened publicly to pull back from its commitment to fully withdraw. It did conduct an airstrike against the Taliban in defense of Afghan ground forces in early March just hours after Trump had what he called a good conversation by phone with a senior Taliban leader, Abdul Ghani Baradar.Although the drawdown is required by the Doha agreement, U.S. defense officials had said for many months that they wanted to reduce to 8,600 — the approximate number of troops that were supporting Afghan forces and conducting counterterrorism operations when Trump took office.American officials constructed the Doha agreement mainly as a way of ending U.S. involvement in the war, rather than as an assured path to peace. The withdrawal is subject to Taliban assurances, but it does not require a peace settlement.The deal also is seen by the U.S. as a way to enlist the Taliban in the fight against the Islamic State group. The American military considers the group’s Afghan affiliate as a greater threat than the Taliban.The U.S. agreed to withdraw not just military forces but also all intelligence agency personnel, private security contractors, trainers and advisers. NATO allied forces also are to withdraw.The Doha deal was seen at the time as Afghanistan’s best chance at peace in decades of war, but the government has since been consumed with political turmoil. Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah have both declared themselves winners of last year’s presidential polls, and each declared himself president.Defense Secretary Mark Esper has said that getting out of Afghanistan would advance his aim of devoting more forces to the Asia-Pacific region to counter China, which he sees as the No. 1 long-term threat to the United States.Esper has been skeptical of the Taliban’s commitment to peace, and on May 5 he said neither the Taliban nor the Afghan government is abiding by the agreement.Esper said the Taliban should return to the reduced levels of violence that existed in the week before the Feb. 29 Doha signing. At the time, Ghani put his government forces in a defensive stance, but on Tuesday he ordered a return to the offensive, expressing anger for two attacks, including one that killed 24 people, including infants, at a hospital. The Taliban denied responsibility and the U.S. has blamed the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan for the attack. The Taliban on Thursday said it had carried out a suicide bombing as retaliation for having been falsely accused by Ghani.A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Thomas Campbell, indicated the U.S. stance has not changed.“Consistent with the agreement, the U.S. military will continue to conduct defensive strikes against the Taliban when they attack our (Afghan) partners.,” he said Wednesday. “As the secretary of defense stated recently, this is going to be a windy, bumpy road, but a political agreement is the best way to end the war.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-on-track-to-pull-troops-from-afghanistan-despite-turmoil/story-nIzASOMjU0OlmhK7MN2O0K.html

More vaccine candidates are in the pipeline and awaiting approval for human trials, he added.China had previously said four human trials for possible vaccines were under way. Zeng did not say when the trials, which must complete three phases for the drug to be approved for use, might be finished.Scientists around the world are working at breakneck speed to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, which has killed more than 300,000 people and infected over 4.4 million.But China’s success in largely taming the outbreak could pose a hurdle for its vaccine developers when they reach the final stage of testing. The drug must be administered to a group of volunteers and a placebo given to a control group in the same area where the virus is spreading to see if it works.Beijing-based Sinovac Biotech, which developed one of the vaccines being tested, has told AFP that it is looking to carry out the final stage of its trial abroad because China does not have a large enough coronavirus cluster.Experts say it will take at least 12 to 18 months to develop an effective vaccine, possibly even longer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-has-fifth-virus-vaccine-in-human-trial-official/story-FfBNG09hJjRxhO97ZOix2M.html
15-05-2020||World||Coronavirus could cause 28 million cancelled surgeries globally: Study||Some 28.4 million planned surgeries could be cancelled or postponed globally due to the new coronavirus pandemic, according to new research warning that huge backlogs risk “potentially devastating” consequences for patients and health systems. The study, published this week in the British Journal of Surgery, modelled the expected number of elective operations that would be put on hold in 190 countries during a 12-week peak of COVID-19 disruption.Hospitals in countries grappling with major coronavirus outbreaks have postponed most non-emergency procedures to avoid putting patients at risk, redeploying staff and resources to the virus response.Researchers from the COVIDSurg Collaborative, an information sharing network of surgeons and anaesthetists in 77 countries, estimated that some 2.4 million operations would be cancelled per week in the period, or 28.4 million in total.They called on governments to urgently develop recovery plans to clear the backlog of surgeries and prepare for possible further waves of COVID-19 infection. “Cancelling elective surgery at this scale will have substantial impact on patients and cumulative, potentially devastating consequences for health systems worldwide,” the authors said. “Delaying time-sensitive elective operations, such as cancer or transplant surgery, may lead to deteriorating health, worsening quality of life, and unnecessary deaths.”Globally, around 82 percent of benign surgeries, 38 percent of cancer operations and around a quarter of elective Caesarean sections would be cancelled or postponed, the study found. It said that it would take an average of 45 weeks to clear the backlog, assuming that countries boost their normal surgical volume by 20 percent. The researchers used survey data from specialists at 359 hospitals in 71 countries, as well as information on normal surgery rates to model the likely effect across 190 countries. Their estimate that the peak surge of infections would last around 12 weeks was based on the experience of China’s Hubei province, where the virus emerged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-could-cause-28-million-cancelled-surgeries-globally-study/story-dvpO56XiB1gCKuJa2arCeI.html
15-05-2020||World||Number of Covid-19 cases falls below 100 in China; Wuhan launches massive drive to test 11 million people||The number of patients undergoing treatment for Covid-19 in China has fallen below 100 for the first time since January, even as Wuhan -- the epicentre of the deadly virus -- has launched a massive drive to test all its 11 million residents to detect growing number of asymptomatic cases, officials said on Friday.According to figures released by China’s National Health Commission (NHC) on Friday, the number of coronavirus patients undergoing treatment for the disease came down to 91 as of Thursday.Officials said it is a major landmark for the country where the virus originated.The virus has so far claimed 4,633 lives in China, the NHC said. China has reported 15 new COVID-19 cases, including 11 asymptomatic ones, taking the total number of coronavirus infections in the country to 82,933, the health officials said on Friday.Of the total 82,933 cases, 91 patients are undergoing treatment and 78,209 had been discharged from hospitals after recovery, they said.The total number of asymptomatic coronavirus infections in China now stands at 619, including 492 in Wuhan. Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested COVID-19 positive but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. However, they pose a risk of spreading the disease to others. Though the number of coronavirus cases has fallen, the country continues to struggle with asymptomatic cases, which officials on Friday said has prompted the Chinese authorities to go for mass testing in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December last year before it spread across the world and wreaked havoc. Mass nucleic acid testing on all residents in Wuhan for COVID-19 will help protect people’s health and fully resume social and economic order in the city, Zeng Yixin, deputy head of the NHC told reporters here on Friday.The mass testing is conducive to learning more about the scope of the epidemic in the city and carrying out targeted epidemic control and prevention measures, he said.Conducting nucleic acid tests on all Wuhan residents is no easy task in terms of mobilisation and organisation, Zeng said.“We need to make sure people who have been tested earlier do not have close contact with those who will be tested later, and the accuracy of the test shall not be undermined by the large number of tests,” he said.Wuhan has conducted nucleic acid tests on more than three million residents earlier and will carry out the test on all residents that have not been tested before, according to a notice issued by the local authorities on Thursday.Residents living in old communities, populous communities and communities with previous confirmed cases will be tested first, it said, adding that the local government will shoulder the costs for the tests.

Some curbs have been eased, but officials are keen that new realities stay.Public transport must only be used when absolutely necessary: as a last resort, the mayor’s office said, amidst reports of crowding on the Underground and buses after Prime Minnister Boris Johnson announced some relaxations in the restrictions last Sunday.“Many more Londoners must now walk or cycle. Everyone who can work from home must continue doing so for the foreseeable future. We must all spend more of our leisure time in our local areas to avoid unnecessary journeys. Londoners who can only get to work on rail must now walk or cycle from rail stations rather than using the tube or bus”, the office said.Some streets are to be converted to walking and cycling only, with others restricted to all traffic apart from buses. Streets between London Bridge and Shoreditch, Euston and Waterloo and Old Street and Holborn may be limited to buses, pedestrians and cyclists.Waterloo Bridge and London Bridge may be restricted to people walking, cycling and buses only, with pavements widened to enable people to safely travel between busy railway stations and their workplaces.Khan said: “I ask that Londoners do not use public transport unless it is absolutely unavoidable – it must be a last resort. If you can work from home you should continue to do so. We should all spend more of our leisure time in our local areas too.”“We will need many more Londoners to walk and cycle to make this work. That’s why these plans will transform parts of central London to create one of the largest car-free areas in any capital city in the world”.Transport officials have added an initial 1,000 extra cycle parking spaces across London, focused around busy areas like high streets and transport hubs. A scheme that allows people to use and leave cycles across central London is available for health workers free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-car-free-streets-cycle-paths-new-london-reality/story-1nt2VQFI1JApdi4HJIvZPN.html
15-05-2020||World||Your salad, grown on Mars, may soon be a reality||New insights released on Friday show that plant seeds taken to Mars on the International Space Station (ISS) and spent six months there grow only slightly slower when back on Earth, raising the prospect of growing food on the red planet.Two kg of rocket seeds were on board the ISS with British European Space Agency astronaut, Tim Peake, as part of his Principia mission. They absorbed up to 100 times more radiation than on Earth and were subjected to intense vibrations from the stresses and strains of space travel.When the seeds returned to Earth, 600,000 children from schools and groups in the UK took part in an experiment, supported by the UK Space Agency, to plant them and monitor their growth, comparing it to that of seeds that had remained on Earth.The agency said that while the space seeds grew more slowly and were more sensitive to ageing, they were still viable. It suggests that, by taking sensible steps to protect the seeds on their journey, it should be possible to grow plants in space or on another planet for humans to eat.Peake said: “In one of the largest and most inspirational experiments of its kind, more than half a million young people collected reliable data to help the scientists at Royal Holloway investigate the effects of spaceflight on rocket seeds”.“When humans travel to Mars, they will need to find ways to feed themselves, and this research helps us understand some of the biology of seed storage and germination which will be vital for future space missions”, he added.The research published in journal Life was led by Gerhard Leubner and Jake Chandler from Royal Holloway and Alistair Griffiths from the Royal Horticultural Society.Chandler said: “Transporting high quality seeds to space and beyond will be crucial for growing plants that support human exploration of space, Mars and other worlds. Our study found that a six-month journey to space reduced the vigour of rocket seeds compared to those that stayed on Earth, indicating that spaceflight accelerated the ageing process”.“Thus, while we should carefully consider protecting seeds from potentially harmful factors including space radiation and mechanical vibration, the seeds remained alive, and the prospect of eating home-grown salad on Mars may be one small step closer”.The RHS tasked 8,600 schools and groups across the UK to take part in the controlled study, documenting their results as part of a project called Rocket Science.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/your-salad-grown-on-mars-may-soon-be-a-reality/story-jC3CVmNOAIhGik23zQYCcJ.html

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly ruled out extending the deadline, raising the prospect of Britain ending its post-Brexit transition period on Dec. 31 without a free-trade deal, putting more pressure on an economy already reeling from the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-says-very-little-progress-made-toward-post-brexit-deal/story-bgsY93GCc05YsgvSfQTS4H.html

Health officials consider people of Indian and Asian origin in the UK particularly prone to diabetes.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOf the 22,332 people who died in England hospitals between March 31 and May 12, 5,873 (26%) suffered from either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, the figures reveal, adding that the number of dead categorised as ‘Indian’ rose to 665.Partha Kar, NHS England’s special adviser on diabetes, said: “It is clear that people with diabetes are more at risk of dying from Covid-19. More detailed analysis is currently underway to understand the link between the two, although initial findings indicate that the threat in people under 40 continues to be very low.”The NHS England data complements that of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released last week, showing “significantly higher” risk of death from the virus among Indian and other non-white communities than the white community.The ONS said Indian and other non-white males are 4.2 times more likely to die from a Covid-19-related death and non-white females are 4.3 times more likely than white ethnicity males and females. The UK’s Indian-origin population is estimated to number 1.5 million.The ONS said: “People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani, Indian, and mixed ethnicities also had a statistically significant raised risk of death involving Covid-19 compared with those of White ethnicity”.According to Kamlesh Khunti, a medical expert at the University of Leicester, the reasons Indian and other non-white people figure more in the statistics, despite accounting for only 14 per cent of the UK population, include many coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, working in public-facing occupations, holding different cultural beliefs and behaviours or being at high risk of diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-quarter-of-people-dead-in-england-had-diabetes/story-xjgxy2j6U9azSULICqUG5N.html

We can’t wait for the health crisis to pass first.”Campaigners said the risks were exacerbated by the fact that schools were closed and organisations working to combat child marriage were finding it harder to operate during lockdowns.The pandemic is also making it more difficult for girls to access reproductive health services which could lead to a rise in teenage pregnancies and increased pressure to marry.Worldwide, an estimated 12 million girls are married every year before the age of 18 - nearly one girl every three seconds.A U.N. report last month predicted the pandemic could lead to an extra 13 million child marriages over the next decade.Girls Not Brides, a global partnership of 1,400 organisations working to end child marriage, said members were extremely worried.“People on the ground are saying this is looking bad. It’s likely we are going to see large numbers of child marriages,” said Girls Not Brides chief executive Faith Mwangi-Powell.“This is something I’ve heard from India, from Africa, from Latin America. Some are saying this could undo decades of work we’ve done to reduce child marriage.”She said school closures were a particular concern.“Schools protect girls. When schools shut the risks (of marriage) become very heightened,” said Mwangi-Powell.“Even post-COVID it’s likely many girls will not go back to school, which is very scary. We need to make sure they do.”World Vision’s Hall said there was already anecdotal evidence of a rise in child marriages in South Sudan, Afghanistan and India, where the charity recently worked with police to stop seven marriage after calls to helplines.Hall said there were fears some people would use lockdowns to conceal child marriages, but she expected the spike would come later as families struggle with the economic fallout.Parents may marry off girls as a way to reduce the number of children they have to support or to access dowries.“It really is a survival mechanism. Parents aren’t doing it maliciously - they just don’t see any alternative,” Hall said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-will-put-4-million-girls-at-risk-of-child-marriage-in-next-2-yrs-global-charity/story-3uEvZe4sckgdqO9u4MPNDM.html

But several subsequent studies -- including one funded by the US government -- appear to have doused hopes that HCQ can help patients hospitalised with COVID-19. In the first study released Friday, researchers in France monitored 181 patients hospitalised with pneumonia due to COVID-19 and who needed oxygen. Eighty-four were treated with HCQ and 97 were not.They found no meaningful difference between the groups for either transfer to intensive care, death within seven days or developing acute respiratory distress syndrome within 10 days.“Hydroxychloroquine has received worldwide attention as a potential treatment for COVID-19 because of positive results from small studies,” said the authors of the research, published in the BMJ journal. “However, the results of this study do not support its use in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 who require oxygen.”A second study saw researchers in China split 150 COVID-19 patients in to two groups, one of which received HCQ.After four weeks tests revealed similar rates of sustained infection among both groups, though adverse reactions to treatment were more common in the HCQ group. Nor did the severity or duration of symptoms differ between each group.Hydroxychloroquine and a related compound chloroquine have been used for decades to treat malaria, as well as the autoimmune disorders lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.Last month the European Medicines Agency warned that there was no indication HCQ could treat COVID-19 and said some studies had seen serious and sometimes fatal heart problems in patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-benefit-in-hydroxychloroquine-virus-treatment-studies/story-in9GlwJn7MBCQSUwjn1pxN.html
15-05-2020||World||On claims of underreporting Covid-19 deaths, comeback from Russia||Russia has lashed out at news reports which said that the country is underreporting (by as much as 60 per cent) the number of fatalities due to coronavirus disease Covid-19.Articles in New York Times and Financial Times reported that Russia’s coronavirus death toll could be much higher than government officials are saying. The articles said that they were based on a spike in total mortality rates reported by officials in Moscow, who said the capital registered about 1,800 deaths more in April 2020 than the monthly average.Russia’s Foreign Ministry accused the two US-based publications of spreading “disinformation”.Russian officials have so far reported 642 deaths in April.Authorities say they are only counting deaths that are caused directly by the coronavirus and that since the pandemic came later to Russia, it was able to learn lessons from the experiences of western Europe.Russia as of Thursday had 2,52,245 confirmed coronavirus infections and 2,305 deaths. That put it behind only the United States in the number of infections, but 18th in the world in total deaths and 58th in deaths per million inhabitants.How Russia countsSome countries count everyone who died while infected in their total number of fatalities, others include cases where the virus is suspected to have played a role and some only count deaths directly caused by complications from the virus.Russia is on the conservative end of the scale, attributing fatalities to the coronavirus only when a death can be directly linked, most often through pneumonia.“If someone dies of a heart attack but has been diagnosed with Covid-19, the official cause of death will be heart attack,” said Sergei Timonin, a demographer from Moscow’s Higher School of Economics.Russia has one of the highest coronavirus testing rates in the world, with some six million carried out so far. The New York Times, meanwhile, said that its report was accurate because it was based on data released by an official state agency.But following the foreign ministry statement, some Russian lawmakers demanded that reporters from the newspapers be stripped of their accreditation, effectively banning them from working in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-claims-of-underreporting-covid-19-deaths-comeback-from-russia/story-fk1qSW2okc084PuDkbWpHM.html

China’s Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party refused to do this, and so the political foundation for Taiwan’s WHO participation had “ceased to exist”.Speaking at a news conference in Taipei to press home Taiwan’s desire to take part, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said there was no way Taiwan would do this.“I have no way to accept something which does not exist,” Chen said, adding that Taiwan would not give up efforts to attend the health assembly, even though it has not received an invitation.The issue has taken on broader diplomatic significance thanks to the strong support from the United States and Japan in particular for Taiwan to attend the WHA, to China’s anger.China says it has the right to represent Taiwan on the international stage. Taiwan says that only its democratically elected government can speak for the island’s 23 million people.“We can represent our own people,” Taiwan Deputy Foreign Minister Kelly Hsieh told the same news conference in Taipei. “We hope the WHO can set aside political considerations, and be neutral and professional.”Taiwan attended the WHA as an observer from 2009-2016 when Taipei-Beijing relations were warmer.But China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who China views as a separatist, an accusation she rejects.The WHO says it has no mandate to invite Taiwan to the WHA and that only member states can decide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-rejects-china-s-main-condition-for-who-participation/story-Xyg2ChRjdwQTKrarYZ7CYM.html
15-05-2020||World||Saudi oil rush threatens to disrupt stabilising US oil market||An armada of tankers filled with Saudi crude heading to American shores is raising concern that tanks may fill again just as a US glut shows signs of easing.Over 30 tankers laden are set to arrive in the US Gulf Coast and West Coast during May and June, according to ship tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. The more-than 50 million barrels of Saudi crude on the water threaten to disrupt a positive supply development: US crude stockpiles declined for the first time since January and inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma storage hub contracted by the most in months.“The expected Saudi deliveries could push US inventories back to builds depending on their timing,” said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research at Morningstar Inc. “If the shipments land at a rate that isn’t balanced by falling production or an uptick in exports, then we’ll see a domestic build.”The oil industry has been on edge for months with onshore and offshore storage capacity levels tested worldwide due to ballooning oil inventories spurred by the Covid-19 demand slowdown. On the US West Coast, crude stockpiles are less than 5 million barrels short of reaching the region’s storage capacity.Data from the Energy Information Administration this week showed US crude production dropped for a sixth straight week to the lowest in nearly a year. But even though output is steadily declining, there are still volumes being produced that may have to jostle with Saudi deliveries for storage space.“If all the Saudi tankers unload, the crude they carry will offset during May almost all of the production reductions from March levels, effectively maintaining the current high storage filling rates,” Paola Rodriguez-Masiu, a senior oil market analyst at Rystad Energy, said in a note.Very Large Crude Carries, or VLCCs, headed for the US Gulf include Shaybah, Hong Kong Spirit and Dalma, ship tracking data show. Tankers en route to the Pacific Coast include Sea Jade and Sikinos I. The vessels, mainly supertankers, will deliver over 45 million barrels of Arabian crude to Gulf buyers and at least 7 million to Pacific users. The volume of oil arriving in May and June is equal to nearly a third of all Saudi crude delivered to the US last year.West Coast crude stockpiles are currently at 58.2 million barrels. The inventory picture is brighter on the US Gulf Coast, America’s refining belt. Crude inventories there are 88 million barrels shy of reaching total storage capacity.Still, the market is witnessing delays in discharging Saudi oil. For some ships, it has taken about two weeks to unload cargoes, about twice the usual time to finish the job as small ships that are needed to unload have become increasingly scarce.Oil imports from Saudi Arabia are not set to slow down anytime soon even as the kingdom deepens its production cuts and raises prices for June supply. Plus, a true demand recovery worldwide isn’t expected for at least another year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-oil-rush-threatens-to-disrupt-stabilising-us-oil-market/story-ZbujaHl3fLIi0Z95mp0K5O.html

In 1995, a young Tibetan boy Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was recognised as the 11th Panchen Lama, the second highest spiritual authority in Tibetan Buddhism after Dalai Lama. Days later Nyima had disappeared, becoming the world’s youngest political prisoner. “We do not have any idea of the whereabouts, and yes, we continue to press the Chinese authorities to release the Panchen Lama and to let him free, and let the world know where he is,” Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback told reporters during a conference call on Thursday. “And this takes on an increased interest as China continues to assert the right to appoint the next Dalai Lama, which they do not have the right to do,” Brownback said in response to a question. Meanwhile, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), in a statement, reiterated its call for the State Department to fill the vacancy for the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues. The appointment of the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues is mandated by the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002, however this position has been vacant since January 20, 2017. Previous Special Coordinators have been crucial to raising the profile of religious freedom issues in Tibet and mobilising government resources to address the issue, it said. “The Chinese Communist Party is attempting to erase the unique identity of Tibetan Buddhism,” noted USCIRF Commissioner Gary Bauer. “We need to utilise all of the policy tools available, including the position of Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, to confront this grave threat to religious freedom,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/urge-chinese-authorities-to-free-panchem-lama-says-united-states/story-0m4g4joQtNc1q6a9thlkPI.html
15-05-2020||World||Afghanistan defends offensive ops against Taliban after Russia’s caution||Afghanistan has said its decision to resume offensive operations against the Taliban and other terrorist groups following two attacks on Tuesday that killed scores of Afghans, including newborns, was a “legitimate defensive position”.Tuesday’s attack on the maternity hospital in Dasht-e-Barchi area of Kabul prompted Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to switch from an “active defensive” mode to an “offensive” mode and to resume attacks on the Taliban.The Taliban has distanced itself from the attack on the maternity hospital, which was carried out by four suicide attackers clad in military uniforms, according to reports in the Afghan media. All the attackers were also killed.“In order to keep its people secure and thwart such terrorist attacks, the Afghan government declared its legitimate defensive position against those who claim the responsibilities for such incidents,” Afghan ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement.Also read: India condemns attack on maternity hospital in Afghanistan capital“Undoubtedly, any country who would face such attacks ending with the martyrdom of infants and mothers, would take the same position. In fact, the Afghan government has made its best efforts for bringing sustainable peace, and would continue its efforts,” it added.The statement came after Russia’s presidential envoy Zamir Kabulov told TASS that Ghani’s order to launch an offensive against the Taliban and the suspension of the release of Taliban prisoners will halt the peace process in the war-ravaged nation.“This is regrettable because by his actions the head of the Kabul administration actually stalls the process of moving towards the launch of intra-Afghan negotiations. Such actions clearly indicate that Kabul is not much interested in the early launch of intra-Afghan talks,” Zamir Kabulov was quoted as saying by TASS.The Afghan foreign ministry said the government took an initiative and developed a peace plan in three articles—ceasefire during the coronavirus pandemic, immediate start of talks and release of prisoners from both sides. It pointed out that the proposal was firmly endorsed by neighbours and regional and international colleagues but there was “no positive respond from Taliban”. “Had the Taliban positively responded to that proposal, such terrorist attacks, no matter who is responsible for, could have been averted,” it said.Afghanistan called upon other nations to announce their endorsement of the peace proposal and persuade the Taliban to join the peace process.“It is evident, that those who haven’t positively responded should take the responsibility for having no progress in the peace process,” it said.“Peace is the most important priority of the Afghan government, meanwhile, the Afghan government would utilize all resources to ensure the security and defend its people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-defends-offensive-ops-against-taliban-after-russia-s-caution/story-X6ibXAoL6ebUeOl707ub1M.html
15-05-2020||World||US faces ‘darkest winter’ if response to Covid-19 doesn’t improve: Whistleblower||A whistleblower who says he was removed from his government post for raising concerns about coronavirus preparedness told a congressional hearing on Thursday that the United States could face “the darkest winter” of recent times if it does not improve its response to the pandemic. Hours after President Donald Trump railed against him on Twitter, whistleblower Rick Bright testified to a U.S. House of Representatives panel about readiness for the outbreak.Bright was removed last month as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services responsible for developing drugs to fight the coronavirus.“What we do must be done carefully with guidance from the best scientific minds. Our window of opportunity is closing. If we fail to improve our response now, based on science, I fear the pandemic will get worse and be prolonged,” Bright said during his testimony.The pandemic has infected nearly 1.4 million people in the United States, gutted the economy and killed more than 82,000.Bright testified to the subcommittee on health that he would “never forget” an e-mail he got in January from a U.S. supplier of medical-grade face masks warning of a dire shortage.“He said ‘we are in deep shit. The world is. We need to act,’“ Bright said. “And I pushed that forward to the highest level that I could of HHS and got no response.”Bright testified that the U.S. still lacked a comprehensive plan for ensuring a supply of basic supplies like swabs needed to administer coronavirus tests. Trump, who has been pushing for the U.S. economy to reopen quickly, dismissed Bright as a “disgruntled employee” on Twitter on Thursday morning before the hearing begun.Later on Thursday, Trump told reporters at the White House that he had watched some of Bright’s hearing. “To me he’s nothing more than a really disgruntled, unhappy person,” Trump said, adding that he did not know Bright.“Everything he’s complaining about was achieved,” HHS Secretary Alex Azar told reporters.Earlier this week, leading U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci warned a Senate committee that a premature lifting of lockdowns could lead to additional outbreaks of the deadly coronavirus. Trump on Wednesday described Fauci’s warning as not acceptable. In a whistleblower complaint filed with a government watchdog last week, Bright said that he warned about the virus in January and was met with hostility from HHS leaders.Bright, who was reassigned to a new government job last month, said he was ousted from BARDA because he resisted efforts to push the drugs hydroxychloroquine and the related chloroquine as cures for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus.Bright said in the statement last month that the U.S. government has promoted the medicines as a “panacea” even though they “clearly lack scientific merit.”HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley has disputed Bright’s account, saying in a statement on Tuesday that he was transferred to a job where he was entrusted to spend around $1 billion to develop diagnostic testing.“We are deeply disappointed that he has not shown up to work on behalf of the American people and lead on this critical endeavor,” Oakley said.Bright testified that he has not started his new government job because he has hypertension and took a medical leave.The House subcommittee was also hearing on Thursday from Mike Bowen, co-owner of Prestige Ameritech, the largest U.S. surgical mask producer.It was Bowen who sent Bright an email in January warning that the United States would run out of medical-grade face masks if it did not ramp up production, according to documents included in Bright’s whistleblower complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-faces-darkest-winter-if-response-to-covid-19-doesn-t-improve-whistleblower/story-NtQJ7F5Akr9FKW0xNUvuZP.html

It took 91 days for the death toll to pass 1,00,000 and a further 16 days to reach 2,00,000, according to the Reuters tally of official reports from governments.It took 19 days to go from 200,000 to 300,000 deaths.Here’s a look at the countries with high incidence of Covid-19 deaths in the world:United StatesWith over 1.3 million total coronavirus cases, the US leads the global Covid-19 tally. According to the World Health organisation, the country has reported 80,695 Covid-19 fatalities which is the highest in the world. United KingdomMore than 33,000 people (33,186 to be exact) have succumbed to death in the United Kingdom so far, the World Health organisation data showed. Over 2.29 lakh cases of coronavirus have been reported in the UK till date.Italy The country has the third-highest number of Covid-19 fatalities in the world, and is just behind the UK. Italy has recorded 33,106 deaths due to Covid-19. Italy has more than 2.22 lakh coronavirus cases.SpainThe country has over 2.28 lakh Covid-19 infections. The country has seen 27,104 deaths due to the deadly disease.FranceThe country has witnessed over 27,029 Covid-19 fatalities till date. With nearly 1.4 lakh total coronavirus cases, it is among the top 10 worst hit nations in the world. BrazilThe Latin American country has emerged as the new global hotspot of the Covid-19 disease. It has seen 1,77,589 cases and 12,400 deaths due to coronavirus disease.BelgiumThe country has 53,981 Covid-19 cases and has recorded 8,843 deaths to date.GermanyGermany has 1,72,239 active coronavirus cases and recorded 7,723 deaths due to the coronavirus disease.IranIran is where one of the early outbreaks of Covid-19 was reported. It has now recorded 1,12,725 cases of coronavirus disease and 6,783 deaths.CanadaCanada has recorded 71,486 cases of Covid-19 and 5,209 deaths, according to WHO.Russia on the other hand, which has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in the world, has reported 2,305 Covid-19 deaths so far, the WHO said.With a spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases, Russia’s tally has gone past Britain to 2,52,245.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-10-countries-with-highest-number-of-cases-and-fatalities/story-b0s7F9aFybcjhBNQjngRHP.html
15-05-2020||World||Global Covid-19 deaths top 300k amid mental health warning||A mental illness crisis is looming as millions of people worldwide are surrounded by death and disease and forced into isolation, poverty and anxiety by the Covid-19 pandemic, United Nations health experts said on Thursday.“The isolation, the fear, the uncertainty, the economic turmoil - they all cause or could cause psychological distress,” said Devora Kestel, director of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) mental health department. The UN’s observation came as the worldwide death toll from the coronavirus disease crossed 300,000 on Thursday, according to Worldometer. Over 4.4 million people have been infected.Presenting a UN report and policy guidance on Covid-19 and mental health, Kestel said an upsurge in the number and severity of mental illnesses is likely, and governments should put the issue “front and centre” of their responses.“The mental health and wellbeing of whole societies have been severely impacted by this crisis and are a priority to be addressed urgently,” she said.The report highlighted several regions and sections of societies as vulnerable to mental distress - including children and young people isolated from friends and school, health care workers who are seeing thousands of patients infected with and dying from the new coronavirus.Emerging surveys are showing Covid-19’s impact on mental health globally. Psychologists say children are anxious and increases in cases of depression and anxiety have been recorded in many countries. Domestic violence is rising, and health workers are reporting an increased need for psychological support.Reuters last week reported from interviews with doctors and nurses in the US who said either they or their colleagues had experienced a combination of panic, anxiety, grief, numbness, irritability, insomnia and nightmares.Outside of the health sector, the WHO report said many people are distressed by the immediate health impacts and the consequences of physical isolation, while many others are afraid of infection, dying, and losing family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-covid-19-deaths-top-300k-amid-mental-health-warning/story-2dD884B0Eu2WwMqYIxAAjP.html
15-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Vatican to introduce temperature checks at St. Peter’s Basilica||People attending Masses in St. Peter’s and other papal basilicas in Rome will have their temperature checked as part of measures to contain the spread of coronavirus, the Vatican said on Thursday.It did not say when the new measures will take effect. Public Masses will resume in churches in Italy on Monday under strict conditions outlined in a protocol signed last week by Italy’s bishops conference and the government.St. Peter’s is on Vatican territory and the other three papal basilicas - St. Paul’s Outside the Walls, St. John’s In Lateran and St. Mary Major - have sovereign, extra-territorial status and so technically are not part of Italy.The new rules for churches in Italy include limiting numbers, distancing and masks but they do not impose thermal scanning, meaning the papal basilicas will have even stricter rules.Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said thermal temperature scanning will be used at least during services on Sundays and religious feast days.He said officials at each basilica will decide the maximum number of people who can safely enter and that Vatican police, Italian police and volunteers will control the flow.Bruni did not say when the new provisions would take effect and when Pope Francis would next say a Mass from the main altar of St. Peter’s.He is due to say a private Mass on Monday at a side chapel where the St. Pope John Paul is buried, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of John Paul’s birth.Thousands of people usually attend major papal events in St. Peter’s and the other basilicas but it is unlikely that those numbers will be allowed in again for some time.The pope has been saying Masses in either an empty St. Peter’s or the chapel in his residence and the faithful have been watching on television or the internet.Technically, St. Peter’s has remained open during the Italian lockdown, which began in early March, although only for private prayer and few people have entered because of increased security. It was still not clear when it and the other basilicas will be reopened to tourists.Italian museums will reopen on Monday but the reopening of the Vatican Museums, which received 7 million visitors last year, will likely be further delayed while safety measures are put in place, according to a Vatican source.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vatican-to-introduce-temperature-checks-at-st-peter-s-basilica/story-v6WnQ3xVxYiCnWFVas34WJ.html

Researchers at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) had a person loudly repeat the phrase “stay healthy” for 25 seconds inside a closed box.A laser projected into the box illuminated droplets, allowing them to be seen and counted. They stayed in the air for an average of 12 minutes, the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the US (PNAS) showed.Taking into account the known concentration of coronavirus in saliva, scientists estimated that each minute of loudly speaking can generate more than 1,000 virus-containing droplets capable of remaining airborne for eight minutes or more in a closed space. “This direct visualisation demonstrates how normal speech generates airborne droplets that can remain suspended for tens of minutes or longer and are eminently capable of transmitting disease in confined spaces,” the researchers conclude.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-may-spread-via-speech-study/story-IESOV6Mr7Lti16rdHgrWGL.html
15-05-2020||World||US health authorities issue alert over Covid-19 linked childhood illness||US health authorities issued an alert Thursday over a rare but sometimes deadly autoimmune condition among children that is believed to be linked to Covid-19.The illness, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), was first reported in Britain in late April.“Healthcare providers who have cared or are caring for patients younger than 21 years of age meeting MIS-C criteria should report suspected cases to their local, state, or territorial health department,” said the CDC.The criteria include fever, multiple inflamed organs that cause severe illness requiring hospitalization, a confirmed active or recent coronavirus infection and no other plausible causes.The condition had previously been referred to as Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (PMIS) by the state of New York, where there have been more than a hundred reported cases, including at least three deaths.Doctors who have treated the illness say patients sometimes have symptoms similar to a rare condition called Kawasaki disease, which causes blood vessels throughout the body to swell, leading to extreme pain.The CDC said that physicians should “consider MIS-C in any pediatric death with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection,” referring to the virus that causes Covid-19. But it is not yet known if the condition is limited to children, the CDC added. Sunil Sood, a pediatrician at Cohen Children’s Medical Center in New York, told AFP that some children had very mild forms of illness, but about half of the patients that he and colleagues had seen had to be treated in intensive care for heart inflammation.The treatment involves injecting antibodies as well as administering steroids and aspirin in case patients experienced a sudden loss of blood pressure, called “shock.”He added that the cases mainly seemed to emerge four to six weeks after a child had been infected and had already developed antibodies.“They had the virus, the body fought it off earlier. But now there’s this delayed exaggerated immune response,” he said.Adding to the mystery, the cases were first reported in Europe and then in North America, but not in Asian countries such as China, Taiwan and South Korea where the virus first emerged.There has been speculation that certain populations may be more genetically susceptible and others less so, said Sood, though that theory is not confirmed.Six out of eight patients in a recent Lancet study from Britain were of Afro-Caribbean descent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-health-authorities-issue-alert-over-covid-19-linked-childhood-illness/story-qdm6NzYu0lRELHFx2Ms20I.html

The US and China relations have deteriorated after the coronavirus outbreak. The US has expressed disappointment over Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus which has claimed over 80,000 lives in America. China has also been accused of stealing Intellectual Property and research work. “Billions of dollars, billions... Yeah, I pulled it back,” Trump said on Fox Business News on Thursday when asked about reports that the US had pulled out billions of dollars of American pension funds in Chinese investment.Also Watch | Covid: Chinese hackers targeting US vaccine research? Donald Trump responds  In another question, the president was asked whether he will force Chinese companies to follow all conditions for being listed at the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ. Chinese companies like Alibaba are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but they do not report earnings -- the way an American company does, the interviewer said. “We are looking at that very strongly. It’s pretty amazing but here’s the problem with that. Let’s say we do that, right? So what are they going to do? They are going to move their listing to London or someplace else. You see?” Trump said. “Let’s say you want to get tough. You know everyone wants to be a tough guy. Look I am the toughest guy but what happens is they say ‘okay, we will move to London or we will go to Hong Kong’,” he said.Meanwhile, China is mulling actions against US lawmakers who have introduced a legislation in the Senate proposing sanctions against China for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, according to news reports. “The Chinese government is lashing out at those who are appropriately trying to hold them accountable for intentionally misleading us about the nature of the novel coronavirus, where it was spreading and how quickly things were getting out of control. I consider their threats a badge of honour,” Congressman Jim Banks said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/billions-of-dollars-donald-trump-withdraws-us-pension-fund-from-china-investments/story-ngdcweSgNXzfxnXZWrYExI.html
15-05-2020||World||3 million more US layoffs due to Covid-19 pandemic intensify fears of lasting damage||Nearly 3 million laid-off workers applied for U.S. unemployment benefits last week as the viral outbreak forced more companies to slash jobs even though most states have begun to let some businesses reopen.Roughly 36 million people have now sought jobless aid in just the two months since the coronavirus first forced businesses to close down and shrink their workforces, the government said Thursday. An additional 842,000 people applied for aid last week through a separate program for self-employed and gig workers.All told, the figures point to a job market gripped by its worst crisis in decades and an economy that is sinking into a deep downturn. The pace of new applications for aid has declined over the past several weeks but is still four times the record high that prevailed before the coronavirus struck hard in March.The waves of job cuts have heightened concerns that additional government aid, on top of the nearly $3 trillion already allocated, is necessary to sustain the economy. Without another aid package, many economists worry that thousands of small businesses will go bankrupt, leaving millions of the unemployed with no job to return to. And state and local governments, facing huge revenue shortfalls, could be forced to lay off millions more workers and cut services.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week stressed his belief that Congress should consider providing additional rescue money to avoid prolonging an economic catastrophe.Republicans in Congress are locked in a standoff with Democrats, who have proposed trillions more in aid. Republican leaders say they want to first see how the previous rescue packages affect the economy and have expressed skepticism about approving much more spending now. That sentiment has alarmed some economists.“There really isn’t any sign that the labor market is bottoming out yet,” said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, the career website.The Trump administration insists that as states reopen, more Americans will shop, dine out and resume other activities, thereby stimulating the economy. But early data suggests it is fear of contracting the virus, even more than shutdown orders, that may be impairing the economy. Without stronger public health measures, such as widespread testing or a vaccine, economists say such fear will depress growth even as more states reopen their economies.Even though Georgia reopened its restaurants for sit-down dining late last month, Adam Ozimek, chief economist at Upwork, said data from the reservation site OpenTable shows that reservations are still 91% below their pre-virus level.“Simply ending lockdowns is not going to be a panacea for these companies,” Ozimek said. “People aren’t going out because they don’t feel safe yet.”The number of people seeking unemployment benefits actually rose last week in Georgia, as well as in Florida, which has also started to reopen. In Florida, that increase likely reflects a troubled system that caused a belated processing of claims that had been filed earlier.A few other states that have lifted some restrictions, like South Carolina and Texas, reported declines in jobless claims.President Donald Trump appeared to respond to the report by tweeting, “Good numbers coming out of States that are opening. America is getting its life back!”In Ohio, shopping malls have reopened for the first time since March but have seen little traffic. Roughly two-thirds of the stores in one mall outside Toledo were still closed Tuesday.Ozimek pointed to signs that business failures are rising. A survey by the Census Bureau, released Thursday, found that 41% of small businesses have closed temporarily since the pandemic hit. Other research has found that half of small businesses lack enough cash to survive longer than a month without revenue.“Those are the signs that we’ve stretched the economy too far, and it’s starting to tear,” Ozimek said.State and local governments, which cut nearly 1 million workers in April, are running out of money and collectively posing a threat to the national economy. The recession will likely produce the sharpest plunge in state tax revenue since the center began tracking such data in the early 1970s, said Lucy Dadayan, senior research associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.About two-thirds of the states have reported data for April, with most showing worrisome declines. California’s tax revenue fell 65% compared with a year earlier. New Jersey’s dropped 59%, Pennsylvania’s 51%. Sales tax revenue has shrunk as consumer spending has tumbled. And income taxes have been diminished by the widespread job losses.Spending by states and localities plays a vital role in the national economy: It amounted to $2.33 trillion last year — 11% of the U.S. gross domestic product. States and localities employed nearly 20 million workers in February.In the meantime, jobless workers in some states are still reporting difficulty applying for or receiving benefits. These include free-lance, gig and self-employed workers, who became newly eligible for jobless aid this year.Kelly Kelso, a stage crew member in Nashville, filed for unemployment aid after her company, Live Nation, canceled all summer tours. She has no idea when touring will resume. She applied in late March but hasn’t received a single check. And she can’t get answers.“I’ve probably called a hundred times and been disconnected every time,” Kelso said.Kelso’s partner is a self-employed musician who finally began receiving unemployment benefits after five weeks. But for the couple, who have a 5-year-old son, money is scarce. Their landlord is demanding rent.The latest jobless claims follow a devastating jobs report last week. The unemployment rate soared to 14.7% in April, the highest rate since the Great Depression, and employers shed 20.5 million jobs. A decade’s worth of job growth was wiped out in a single month.Even those figures failed to capture the full scale of the damage. Many workers in April were counted as employed but absent from work but should have been counted as temporarily unemployed.Millions of other laid-off workers didn’t look for a new job in April, likely discouraged by their prospects in a mostly shuttered economy, and weren’t included, either. If all those people had been counted as unemployed, the jobless rate would have reached nearly 24%.Most economists have forecast that the official unemployment rate could hit 18% or higher in May before potentially declining by summer.___AP Writers Martin Crutsinger and Travis Loller in Nashville contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-million-more-us-layoffs-due-to-covid-19-pandemic-intensify-fears-of-lasting-damage/story-PK6VitWJy1T2rEAMUWDDPK.html
15-05-2020||World||‘Not happy right now’: Trump rules out US renegotiating trade deal with China||US President Donald Trump has ruled out renegotiating the trade deal with China and expressed disappointment over Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has spread across the world killing over 3,00,000 people, including 80,000 in America.  The US and China in the beginning of the year signed Phase-1 of a trade deal, ending a bitter two-year tariff war that had rattled the global economy. “The Chinese said somewhere that they would like to renegotiate the (trade) deal. We are not going to renegotiate,” Trump told Fox Business News on Thursday. “Look, I’m not happy about anything having to do with that particular subject (China) right now. Everything I said turned out to be right. You look at other countries they charge us tariffs to do business and we are not allowed to charge them,” he said. Responding to a question, Trump said the Chinese have always stolen Intellectual Property (IP) from the US. “They were never called (out). Now they are being called out,” he said. “We can stop them, they are going to try doing it. I mean you could also stop doing business with them, that is one thing. Look, we have lost a fortune dealing with China. We have rebuilt China,” he said. “They have done a great job but the people sitting in this seat (The Oval Office) have allowed them to rip us off like you’ve never seen before and that includes President (Barack) Obama and (Joe) Biden ‘sleepy Joe’. He allowed them to rip this country off. We spent hundreds of billions, we gave them hundreds of billions of dollars year-in and year-out,” Trump said. The president said he does not want to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping right now. “I have a very good relationship, but I just -- right now I don’t want to speak to him,” he said. There are many things that the United States can do, he asserted. “There are many things we could do. We could do things, we could cut off the whole relationship. Now if you did what would happen? You would save USD 500 billion, if you cut off the whole relationship. Look, at what point does -- and I said this for years I said it with other countries also you know -- China is not the only country ripping us off at the NATO where we defend Europe for nothing by the way essentially nothing I was able to get them to pay hundreds of billions of dollars more,” he said. The coronavirus, which first emerged in China’s Wuhan city in December last, has killed over 3,00,000 people with 4.3 million confirmed cases across the world. More than a quarter of all confirmed COVID-19 cases are from the US. There has been increasing pressure on the President Trump, in the last several weeks, to take action against China as lawmakers and opinion-makers feel that the COVID-19 spread across the world from Wuhan because of Chinese inaction.

Equal access was non-negotiable, he said. Hudson said on Thursday it was vital that any coronavirus vaccine reach all regions and he was sorry that his earlier remarks had created such a storm.“I have been campaigning on European readiness to treat COVID-19 for months, building capacity in Europe, making sure we are ready, getting governments in the EU aligned,” Hudson told an event organised by the Financial Times.Sanofi, which has urged stronger European coordination in the hunt for a vaccine and has U.S. financial support, clarified that any such vaccine would be made available to all.There is no vaccine and no known treatment for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus. Drugmakers are racing to develop what would be a lucrative prize, but have sought financial support to mitigate the risks.Sanofi is working on two vaccine projects against COVID-19. One is with British rival GlaxoSmithKline Plc that has received financial support from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the U.S. Health Department, and the other with U.S. company Translate Bio that will use a different technology.“NON-NEGOTIABLE”Given the support from BARDA, doses produced by Sanofi in the United States are expected to go to U.S. patients first, a prospect that has raised concern in Europe.“A vaccine against COVID-19 should be a public good for the world. The equal access of all to the virus is non-negotiable,” Philippe said on Thursday.Philippe said he had reinforced this message to Sanofi’s chairman, Serge Weinberg, who in return had assured the prime minister of the distribution in France of any Sanofi vaccine.Hudson’s initial comments upset President Emmanuel Macron, an Elysee palace official said. A presidency official will meet with Sanofi representatives next week, the official added. Sanofi has 18 production sites in France.Hudson said Europe lacked a body akin to BARDA. “That model does not exist in Europe,” he said, even though there was support from governments to establish one. The controversy has raised questions over whether Europe has been too slow to respond in terms of organising and funding vaccine research. Sanofi reiterated on Thursday that the United States had moved more quickly in this regard.The charity Oxfam said pharmaceutical companies should not be able to decide “who lives and who dies”.Officials meeting at the World Health Assembly next week must demand that vaccines and tests are patent-free, Oxfam said in a statement. They should also be distributed equitably to all countries.“Governments must work together to stop corporations profiteering from the pandemic and save the lives of people across the globe,” Oxfam said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sanofi-ceo-pledges-virus-vaccine-for-all-after-french-backlash/story-5VJOYAbfYxuXCisjdEK1OK.html
15-05-2020||World||Trump threatens to cut off whole relationship with China||US President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to cut off the whole relationship with China in response to the spread of the novel coronavirus across the world that has killed nearly 300,000 people globally, including over 80,000 in America.“There are many things we could do. We could cut off the whole relationship,” Trump told Fox Business News in an interview. There has been increasing pressure on the president, in the last several weeks, to take action against China as lawmakers and opinion makers feel that the COVID 19 spread across the world from Wuhan because of Chinese inaction.Responding to a question, Trump said that he does not want to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping right now. “I have a very good relationship, but I just -- right now I don’t want to speak to him,” he said, adding that he is very disappointed with China. The United States has repeatedly asked China to allow the international community to go into a Wuhan lab to investigate the origins of coronavirus.“We asked to go over and they said no. They didn’t want our help. And I figured that was OK because they must know what they are doing. So it was either stupidity, incompetence or deliberate,” Trump said.Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have claimed that the deadly virus originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected last December.China has denied covering up the extent of its coronavirus outbreak and accused the US of attempting to divert the public attention by insinuating that the virus originated from a virology laboratory in Wuhan.
