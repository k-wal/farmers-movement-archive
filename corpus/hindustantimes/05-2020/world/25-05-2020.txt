The total number of infections has reached 157,814.More than 120,000 people have recovered and people needing intensive care continued on a downward trend, according to the health ministry statistics. The ministry has said its treatment protocol includes the early use of antivirals hydroxychloroquin and favipiravir, as well as the antibiotic azithromycin, along with high frequency oxygen.The World Health Organization on Monday said it was temporarily dropping hydroxychloroquin — the anti-malarial drug U.S. President Trump is taking — from its global study into experimental Covid-19 treatments to review its safety.Turkey ranks ninth in a tally by Johns Hopkins University but experts believe the number of infections globally could be much higher than reported.Turkey’s 83 million citizens are on the third day of a four-day nationwide lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-records-29-deaths-987-new-covid-19-cases/story-Di1kYu1SCSJN3SSxtjozGL.html

The US President has said he was taking the drug to help prevent infection.“The executive group has implemented a temporary pause of the hydroxychloroquine arm within the Solidarity trial while the safety data is reviewed by the data safety monitoring board,” Tedros told an online briefing. He said the other arms of the trial - a major international initiative to hold clinical tests of potential treatments for the virus - were continuing.The WHO has previously recommended against using hydroxychloroquine to treat or prevent coronavirus infections, except as part of clinical trials.Dr. Mike Ryan, head of the WHO emergencies programme, said the decision to suspend trials of hydroxychloroquine had been taken out of “an abundance of caution”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-pauses-trial-of-hydroxychloroquine-in-covid-19-patients-due-to-safety-concerns/story-UgpxgK5xmbHR2FEtL1EenJ.html
25-05-2020||World||PM Boris Johnson faces flak as aide says ‘no regrets’ on breaching lockdown||Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced a groundswell of criticism on Monday from MPs, bishops, scientists and millions of people for defending controversial aide Dominic Cummings breaking lockdown rules recently, while the latter insisted he had ‘no regrets’ for his actions.The UK’s response to the coronavirus pandemic remained overshadowed by the story perceived by millions as one rule for those in power and another for the people. Johnson continued to resist demands from many of his party MPs and others to sack Cummings.Cummings, who has been close to Johnson since the successful Vote leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, travelled to Durham in north-east England with his family when the official advice followed by Britons was to ‘stay home’.The prime minister’s chief adviser went on television on Monday afternoon to present his version of events, alleging that much of media reporting had been wrong and was to blame for the anger among people over his movements in end of March until April 14. He had not offered to resign, nor had he considered it.More than 10 bishops said Johnson’s defence of Cummings was “risible”, that he had “no respect for the people”, “lacked integrity”, and risked undermining the trust of the public. Pete Broadbent, the bishop of Willesden, tweeted: “Johnson has now gone the full Trump.”As police chiefs said it would now be difficult to enforce curbs, at least three experts on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies influencing government moves on the coronavirus pandemic deplored Johnson’s remarks: Stephen Reicher, Robert West and Susan Michie.Reicher said: “If you look at the research it shows the reason why people observed lockdown was not for themselves, it wasn’t because they were personally at risk, they did it for the community, they did it because of a sense of ‘we’re all in this together’.”“If you give the impression there’s one rule for them and one rule for us you fatally undermine that sense of ‘we’re all in this together’ and you undermine adherence to the forms of behaviour which have got us through this crisis”, he said.Closely following the government response to the pandemic, writer JK Rowling tweeted: “Watching Johnson, This is despicable. Parents all over this country have abided by the lockdown rules, even while ill themselves. Hundreds of thousands managed toddlers while shut up inside cramped accommodation, purely for the common good AS THE GOVERNMENT TOLD THEM TO DO”.“I can’t remember a clearer demonstration of contempt for the people from a sitting Prime Minister. Johnson might a well had shambled into shot, give us all the finger and walked off again”, she added.Scotland first minister Nicola Sturgeon added: “I fear, and I say this with a heavy heart, Boris Johnson is putting his political interest ahead of the public interest. And when trust in a public health message and public health advice is as important as it is right now the consequences of that could be serious”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-boris-johnson-faces-flak-as-aide-says-no-regrets-on-breaching-lockdown/story-Ke5t4rtwf3xhYmrywzP8OO.html
25-05-2020||World||US expands travel ban to Brazil, poised to cross 100,000 toll||The Trump administration on Sunday suspended the entry of travelers from Brazil citing widespread human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus there and the threat infected individuals from there pose to the United States, which is staring at the grimmest of Covid-19 records of 100,000 deaths.The travel ban goes into effect from Friday and applies to immigrants and non-immigrants from Brazil, same as earlier orders suspending travelers from China, Iran, the Schengen area, the United Kingdom and Ireland.Citing the World Health Organization, which the United States has threatened to defund if it does not fix its China skew, the White House said in an official proclamation Brazil is currently number three in the world in number of infections — at 310,087 (it’s No 2 at 363,211, according to the Johns Hopkins University Covid-19 tracker, behind only the United States).The potential of infected people from Brazil entering the United States undetected, President Donald Trump said in the proclamation issued under his name and seal, “threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security”.Trump has touted his ban on travel from China, effective February 2, as the lynchpin of his administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak, as he continues to be accused of a later a delayed and botched response.US fatalities from Covid-19 stood Monday morning at 97,722, just shy of the 100,000 mar, up by 633 over the past 24 hours. Infections went up by 20,634 over the same period to 1.66 million.President Trump, who has called himself a cheerleader for keeping up the spirits of Americans during these times of despair and despondency with his optimism, tried to focus on the positives. “Cases, numbers and deaths are going down all over the Country!” he wrote on twitter Sunday morning, which is true, but so is the eventuality of the US crossing 100,000, accounting for a third of the toll worldwide, which he did not acknowledge.The US president has sought to shift as much of the blame for the outbreak away from himself and his administration as he can, with an eye on the November elections. He has accused China of being slow to alert the world and threatened to punish the WHO for helping China cover up its alleged mishandling of the epidemic from the start, and downplaying it.Robert O’Brien, the US national security adviser, told an NBC TV interviewer Sunday China “unleashed a virus on the world that’s destroyed trillions of dollars in American economic wealth that we’re having to spend to keep our economy alive, to keep Americans afloat during this virus”.“The cover-up that they did of the virus is going to go down in history, along with Chernobyl,” he added, referring to the world’s worst nuclear disaster yet at a nuclear plant in erstwhile Soviet Union’s Ukraine in 1986. Moscow is alleged to have covered up the exact extent of the devastation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-expands-travel-ban-to-brazil-poised-to-cross-100-000-toll/story-C3RNKTyVoYpXvObFe8BO7M.html

Thoughts are with the Derby sangat who have been providing 500 meals a day from Guru Arjan Dev Gurdwara”.Images of the person caught on CCTV entering the premises were shared by the gurdwara on social media while reporting the incident, causing concern and demands for his arrest.The gurdwara said in a statement: “This morning at 6am an individual entered the Gurdwara premises causing thousands of pounds of damage…We can confirm that no individuals were injured and that the clean-up process has begun”.“This hate crime or any sort of crime against a Sikh will never deter us in our practice of seva and simran. We will continue the service the community with Langar and continue to stream live nitnem (daily prayers). We will ensure the safety of all our Sevadhaars (colunteers) and employees”, it added.Gurdwaras across the UK have been recipients of funding as part of a government scheme to install security equipment to prevent hate-crime in places of worship, but such incidents have continued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gurdwara-attacked-in-uk-hate-crime-thousands-of-pounds-worth-damage-caused/story-GLU8LhHAEkTIx2b8BRUA0L.html
25-05-2020||World||China threatens US counter measures if punished for Hong Kong law||China on Monday threatened counter measures against the United States if it was punished for plans to impose a sedition law on Hong Kong, that the business hub’s security chief hailed as a new tool that would defeat “terrorism”.Beijing plans to pass a new security law for Hong Kong that bans treason, subversion and sedition after months of massive, often-violent pro-democracy protests last year.But many Hong Kongers, business groups and western nations fear the proposal could be a death blow to the city’s treasured freedoms and thousands took to the streets on Sunday despite a ban on mass gatherings introduced to combat coronavirus.As police dispersed the crowds with tear gas and water cannon, Washington’s national security advisor Robert O’Brien warned the new law could cost the city its preferential US trading status.But China’s foreign ministry said Beijing would react to any sanctions from Washington. “If the US insists on hurting China’s interests, China will have to take every necessary measure to counter and oppose this,” foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters on Monday.Hong Kong has become the latest flashpoint in soaring tensions between the world’s two super powers which China has likened to “the brink of a new Cold War”.The refusal to grant Hong Kongers democracy has sparked rare bipartisan support in an otherwise bitterly divided Washington during the Trump administration.Beijing portrays the city’s protests as a foreign-backed plot to destabilise the motherland and says other nations have no right to interfere in how the international business hub is run.- Mainland agents? -Protesters, who have hit the streets in their millions, say they are motivated by years of Beijing chipping away at the city’s freedoms since it was handed back to China by Britain in 1997.Hong Kong enjoys liberties unseen on the mainland, as well as its own legal system and trade status.Campaigners view the security law proposal as the most brazen move yet by Beijing to end free speech and the city’s ability to make its own laws.Of particular concern is a provision allowing Chinese security agents to operate in Hong Kong, with fears it could spark a crackdown on those voicing dissent against China’s communist rulers.On the mainland, subversion laws are routinely wielded against critics.The proposed law, which China’s rubber-stamp legislature is expected to act on quickly, will also bypass Hong Kong’s own legislature.The city’s influential Bar Association on Monday described the proposed motion as “worrying and problematic” -- and warned it may even breach the territory’s mini-constitution.The proposal has spooked investors with Hong Kong’s stock exchange suffering its largest drop in five years on Friday. On Monday it had yet to recover, closing just 0.10 percent up.- ‘Restore social order’ -Hong Kong’s unpopular pro-Beijing government has welcomed the law.“Terrorism is growing in the city and activities which harm national security, such as ‘Hong Kong independence’, become more rampant,” security minister John Lee said in a statement welcoming the planned legislation.Police chief Chris Tang cited 14 recent cases where explosives had been seized and said the new law would “help combat the force of ‘Hong Kong independence’ and restore social order”.Last year’s protests were initially sparked by plans to allow extraditions to the mainland but soon snowballed into a popular revolt against Beijing and the city’s police force.Beijing has dismissed protester demands for an inquiry into the police, amnesty for the 8,500 people arrested and universal suffrage.The demonstrations fizzled at the start of the year as mass arrests and the coronavirus took their toll.But they have rekindled in recent weeks with Sunday’s rally producing the most intense clashes for months and police making at least 120 arrests.During last year’s huge pro-democracy rallies, mob attacks were common on both sides of the political divide and a video of protesters beating a lawyer at Sunday’s rally was seized on by China’s state media.Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the nationalist tabloid Global Times, posted the video on Twitter -- a platform banned in mainland China.“Let’s see what the Washington-backed Hong Kong democracy really looks like,” he wrote.su-jta/rbu||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-threatens-us-counter-measures-if-punished-for-hong-kong-law/story-QcSI1klJLS5gy5IzViEjSL.html

25-05-2020||World||Japan lifts coronavirus emergency in all remaining areas||Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe lifted a coronavirus state of emergency in Tokyo and four other remaining areas on Monday, ending the restrictions nationwide as businesses begin to reopen.Experts on a government-commissioned panel approved the lifting of the emergency in Tokyo, neighbouring Kanagawa, Chiba and Saitama prefectures, and in Hokkaido to the north, which had more cases and remained under the emergency declaration after it was removed in most of Japan earlier this month.Abe said the lifting of the emergency does not mean the end of the outbreak. He said the goal is to balance preventive measure and the economy until vaccines and effective drugs become available.Japan, with about 16,600 confirmed cases and about 850 deaths, has so far avoided a large outbreak like those experienced in the US and the Europe despite its softer restrictions.But the world’s third largest economy is fallen into a recession, and public discontent over Abe’s handling of the coronavirus has sent his support ratings tumbling. Recent media surveys show public support for his Cabinet has plunged below 30%, the lowest since he returned to office in December 2012.Abe declared the state of emergency on April 7 in several parts of Japan including Tokyo, expanded it to the entire nation later in the month, and then extended it until the end of May.Also read: Did Japan just beat coronavirus without lockdowns or mass testing?Under the emergency, people were asked to stay at home and non-essential businesses were requested to close or reduce operations, but there was no enforcement. Since May 14, when the measures were lifted in most of Japan, more people have left their homes and stores have begun reopening.Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said recent data suggest that infections have slowed enough and pressure on the medical system has fallen enough to allow a gradual resumption of social and economic activity. He said Tokyo, Kanagawa and Hokkaido, where the number of infections is still fluctuating, need to be watched closely.On Monday, Matsuya department store, a landmark in Tokyo’s posh Ginza shopping district, resumed operation. Sales staff wearing plastic face shields welcomed customers with bows but no verbal greetings under new guidelines.Individual prefectures are allowed to impose their own measures. Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike said last week that the capital will reopen in three phases starting with schools, libraries, museums, and longer service hours for restaurants. She said theaters, sports facilities and other commercial establishments will be next, with nightclubs, karaoke and live music houses in the final phase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-lifts-coronavirus-emergency-in-all-remaining-areas/story-nG4pYUlnOttC44VLTAHKRI.html
25-05-2020||World||Did Japan just beat coronavirus without lockdowns or mass testing?||Japan’s state of emergency is set to end with new cases of the coronavirus dwindling to mere dozens. It got there despite largely ignoring the default playbook.No restrictions were placed on residents’ movements, and businesses from restaurants to hairdressers stayed open. No high-tech apps that tracked people’s movements were deployed. The country doesn’t have a center for disease control. And even as nations were exhorted to “test, test, test,” Japan has tested just 0.2% of its population -- one of the lowest rates among developed countries.Yet the curve has been flattened, with deaths well below 1,000, by far the fewest among the Group of Seven developed nations. In Tokyo, its dense center, cases have dropped to single digits on most days. While the possibility of a more severe second wave of infection is ever-present, Japan has entered and is set to leave its emergency in just weeks, with the status lifted already for most of the country and Tokyo and the remaining four other regions set to exit Monday.Analyzing just how Japan defied the odds and contained the virus while disregarding the playbook used by other successful countries has become a national conversation. Only one thing is agreed upon: that there was no silver bullet, no one factor that made the difference.“Just by looking at death numbers, you can say Japan was successful,” said Mikihito Tanaka, a professor at Waseda University specializing in science communication, and a member of a public advisory group of experts on the virus. “But even experts don’t know the reason.”One widely shared list assembled 43 possible reasons cited in media reports, ranging from a culture of mask-wearing and a famously low obesity rate to the relatively early decision to close schools. Among the more fanciful suggestions include a claim Japanese speakers emit fewer potentially virus-laden droplets when talking compared to other languages.Contact TracingExperts consulted by Bloomberg News also suggested a myriad of factors that contributed to the outcome, and none could point to a singular policy package that could be replicated in other countries.Nonetheless, these measures still offer long-term lessons for countries in the middle of pandemic that may yet last for years.An early grassroots response to rising infections was crucial. While the central government has been criticized for its slow policy steps, experts praise the role of Japan’s contact tracers, which swung into action after the first infections were found in January. The fast response was enabled by one of Japan’s inbuilt advantages -- its public health centers, which in 2018 employed more than half of 50,000 public health nurses who are experienced in infection tracing. In normal times, these nurses would be tracking down more common infections such as influenza and tuberculosis.“It’s very analog -- it’s not an app-based system like Singapore,” said Kazuto Suzuki, a professor of public policy at Hokkaido University who has written about Japan’s response. “But nevertheless, it has been very useful.”While countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. are just beginning to hire and train contact tracers as they attempt to reopen their economies, Japan has been tracking the movement of the disease since the first handful of cases were found. These local experts focused on tackling so-called clusters, or groups of infections from a single location such as clubs or hospitals, to contain cases before they got out of control.“Many people say we don’t have a Centers for Disease Control in Japan,” said Yoko Tsukamoto, a professor of infection control at the Health Sciences University of Hokkaido, citing a frequently held complaint about Japan’s infection management. “But the public health center is a kind of local CDC.”Burning CarThe early response was also boosted by an unlikely happening. Japan’s battle with the virus first came to mainstream international attention with its much-criticized response to the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February that led to hundreds of infections. Still, the experience of the ship is credited with providing Japanese experts with invaluable data early in the crisis on how the virus spread, as well as catapulting it into the public consciousness.Other countries still saw the virus as someone else’s problem, said Tanaka. But in Japan, the international scrutiny over the infections onboard and the pace at which the virus raced throughout the ship raised awareness and recognition that the same can happen across the country, he said. “For Japan, it was like having a burning car right outside your house.”Although political leadership was criticized as lacking, that allowed doctors and medical experts to come to the fore -- typically seen as a best practice in managing public health emergencies. “You could say that Japan has had an expert-led approach, unlike other countries,” Tanaka said.Experts are also credited with creating an easy-to-understand message of avoiding what are called the “Three C’s” -- closed spaces, crowded spaces and close-contact settings -- rather than keeping away from others entirely.“Social distancing may work, but it doesn’t really help to continue normal social life,” said Hokkaido University’s Suzuki. “The ‘Three C’s’ are a much more pragmatic approach and very effective, while having a similar effect.”Different StrainInfectious disease experts also pointed to other determinants, with Shigeru Omi, the deputy head of the expert panel advising the Japanese government and a former chief of the WHO Western Pacific office, citing Japanese people’s health consciousness as possibly the most important factor.The possibility that the virus strain spreading in Japan may have been different, and less dangerous, to that faced by other nations, has also been raised.Researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the U.S. studied coronavirus variants in a database and found one strain of the virus spreading through Europe that had several mutations distinguishing it from the Asian version, according to a paper put in early May. Although the study has not been peer-reviewed and drawn some criticism, the findings point to a need to more thoroughly study how the virus changes.Large questions still remain over the true extent of the pathogen’s spread. In April, a Tokyo hospital conducted tests on a handful of non-Covid patients and found that around 7% had the coronavirus, showing the danger of missing asymptomatic or mild carriers that can become the source of an outbreak. An antibody test on 500 people in the capital suggested the true outbreak could be nearly 20 times larger than figures have shown. Analog contact tracing breaks down when infection numbers are high, and reports of people unable to get tested or even medical treatment for Covid-like symptoms peppered social media during the height of the outbreak.And the fact remains that Japan’s response was less than perfect. While the overall population is much smaller, Asian neighbors such as Taiwan had just seven confirmed deaths from the virus, while Vietnam had none.“You can’t say the Japan response was amazing,” said Norio Sugaya, a visiting professor at Keio University’s School of Medicine in Tokyo and a member of a World Health Organization panel advising on pandemic influenza. “If you look at the other Asian countries, they all had a death rate that was about 1/100th of Western countries.”Buying TimeWhile Japan may have avoided the worst of the health outcomes, the loose lockdown hasn’t protected the country from the economic impact. Its economy, already dealing with the impact of a sales tax hike in October, officially slid into recession in the first three months of the year. Economists have warned the second quarter will be the worst on record, and the specter of deflation, which haunted the economy for decades, once again looms. Tourist numbers plummeted 99.9% in April after the country shut its borders, putting the brakes on a booming industry that had promised to be a growth driver for years. As in other countries, bankruptcies have risen sharply.Even with the the state of emergency about to end, authorities are warning that life will not return to normal. When case numbers slowed in early March, there was public optimism that the worst was over -- only for cases to spike again and trigger the emergency declaration.If a deadlier second wave does follow, the risk factor in Japan, which has the world’s oldest population, remains high. The country has speedily approved Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir and is now scrambling to allow the use of still unproven Fujifilm Holdings Corp.’s antiviral Avigan. There are calls for the country to use the time it has bought itself to shore up its testing and learn in the way its neighbors did from SARS and MERS.Officials have begun to speak of a phase in which people “live with the virus,” with a recognition that Japan’s approach has no possibility of wiping out the pathogen.“We have to assume that the second wave could be much worse than the first wave and prepare for it,” said Yoshihito Niki, a professor of infectious diseases at Showa University’s School of Medicine. “If the next explosion of cases is worse, the medical system will break down.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/did-japan-just-beat-coronavirus-without-lockdowns-or-mass-testing/story-BxjdVNtNHRhTIFwbsB8oHN.html

To cheer them up, Singaporean businessman Dushyant Kumar, his wife and a team of chefs cooked up a giant biryani for a Sunday evening Eid feast for at least 600 migrants.Kumar used a family recipe for the South Asian rice dish often eaten during festive occasions.  “Usually, if they are with their family, they will get to enjoy these kinds of dishes, because everyone will cook and eat, but here these guys are alone,” said Kumar, in between tasting the dish being prepared in big cooking pots at the kitchen of a restaurant.There are about 300,000 foreign labourers in Singapore, most of them from Bangladesh, China and India, and most staying in purpose-built dormitories, in rooms with bunks for 12 to 20 men. “So we want to make sure they don’t feel left out,” said Kumar, whose imitative is supported by funds from donors and a non-governmental organisation.     “The smile on their face gives you a lot of satisfaction,” said Kumar, who has been overseeing the delivery of more than 1,000 meals a day to migrants in quarantine since early April.The government has said employers are required to provide sufficient food for workers during this lockdown, but it is also working with charity groups to make up any shortfalls.Singapore has had more than 30,000 Covid-19 cases, one of the highest tallies in Asia, with the vast majority of infections among migrant workers in their dormitory accommodation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eid-al-fitr-singaporean-businessman-cooks-biryani-for-migrants-amid-covid-crisis/story-HI53d6TVFNbNMLie4XqIgO.html

Johnson has so far defended Cummings’ action.A British cabinet member told ITV channel that the UK government is “bleeding credibility” over the issue. The minister, who was not named by the television network, also said that the cabinet members were “stunned” by Johnson’s statement.Another unnamed minister was quoted by the Sun newspaper as saying, “This is not a bubble story. Real people are furious, because they have been doing the right thing and isolating.”A second unnamed minister cited by the newspaper said that retaining the adviser was “increasingly” looking as a “sign of weakness”.Johnson backed Cummings on Sunday, despite calls from within his own Conservative Party for the aide to resign.“I’ve had extensive face-to-face conversations with Dominic Cummings,” Johnson told a news conference, saying his aide had followed the “instincts of every father” when he travelled with his wife for help with childcare while isolating. “I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly and legally and with integrity.”With Johnson’s words that he had acted with integrity, Cummings was safe, at least for now.Cummings, architect of the 2016 campaign to leave the EU, came under pressure when newspapers reported he had travelled from London to northern England in March when his wife was ill with Covid-19 symptoms during a nationwide lockdown.Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party, described Johnson’s decision to take no action against Cummings as “an insult to the sacrifices made by the British people”.A divisive figure, Cummings is seen by allies and enemies alike as Johnson’s most important and influential strategist.Johnson’s office said Cummings made the 400 km journey after his wife showed symptoms, to ensure his 4-year-old son could be properly cared for by relatives if he too fell ill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bleeding-credibility-signs-of-weakness-boris-johnson-faces-party-wrath-for-backing-aide-who-violated-covid-19-lockdown/story-iJY6P9fLP9cCrLObfsFynL.html

Here’s how Covid-19 crisis is harming the world’s forests||With most of the planet locked down due to the Covid-19 crisis, experts believe this could be the time when nature finally takes a break amid low human activity and get into a healing mode. However, a latest report suggests that coronavirus lockdown may have a detrimental effect on the planet’s forest cover.A report published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), in collaboration with news agency Thomson Reuters, says that the Covid-19 lockdown has put the world’s forests at a risk.According to the report, poor people who have lost work or are temporarily out of work in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic cut down trees for fuel and other purposes.Many people depend on forests for livelihood, food and shelter. Millions who have lost casual work in cities amid the coronavirus crisis are returning to their native places in rural areas, the report states.Also read: With nearly 7,000 Covid-19 cases in 24 hrs, India records biggest surge for 4th dayAround the world, 1 billion people depend on wild foods and 2.4 billion use wood for cooking, while more than nine out of 10 people living in extreme poverty depend on forests for at least part of their livelihoods.Mette Wilkie, director of the forestry division at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), said that trees are more likely to be felled for food and fuel as a third of the world’s population still depend on wood to cook. The Covid-19 lockdown could exacerbate this.UN FAO’s ‘State of the World’s Forests 2020’ report links the rise of infectious diseases, such as Covid-19, to forest loss.According to the report, the planet has lost an estimated 420 million hectares of forest since 1990 - more than three times the size of South Africa.No break for nature?There is a misperception that nature is getting a break during the Covid-19 pandemic, the WEF states in another report. “Many rural areas in the tropics are facing increased pressure from land-grabbing, deforestation, illegal mining and wildlife poaching,” the report reads. Outside urban areas, the picture in rural regions paints a different scenario with an increased pressure on nature and resources. The coronavirus pandemic has infected over 5.5 million people across the globe while more than 3.4 lakh people have succumbed to death due to Covid-19. More than 2 million patients have recovered from the dealy contagion globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-break-for-nature-here-s-how-covid-19-crisis-is-harming-the-world-s-forests/story-idy23EfH6glKPoPecRsVnI.html

Our biggest concern was that they made the trip safely,” said their son, Inam Ur Rahmaan, who instead of welcoming his parents for the Eid al-Fitr holiday found himself picking through the wreckage of flight PK8303 praying for a miracle.Also read: ‘I went towards the light’, says Pakistan plane crash survivor“I got in my car and followed the smoke and the ambulances,” said Rahmaan. “When I saw the area, I realised that it would be a miracle if they had made it.”There were two survivors from onboard the aircraft, while no fatalities were reported on the ground in the densely packed neighbourhood of multi-story homes abutting the eastern edge of Jinnah International Airport where the plane came down.More than two dozen homes were damaged as the airliner roared in, leaving a tangle of severed electric cables and exposed rebar - a broken wing rested against the side of a home, an engine on the ground nearby. The jet fuel set the wreckage ablaze, along with homes and vehicles, sending black smoke into the sky, a Reuters witness said.Crowds rushed to the site, relatives searching for loved ones, rescue workers and the curious. Scores of ambulances and fire-engines jammed the narrow, debris-cluttered streets.One rescue worker told Reuters two bodies were found with oxygen masks on. Many bodies pulled from the wreckage were charred beyond recognition.The airline’s chief executive said on Friday the last message from the pilot indicated a technical problem. A team from Airbus is due to arrive on Monday to investigate, a PIA spokesman said.“They’ll provide all possible assistance including decoding the black box,” the spokesman Khan, referring to the flight data recorder.Screams and fireShahid Ahmed, 45, was at the airport waiting for his mother to arrive. When he reached the crash site he saw rescuers retrieving bodies and people taking selfies.“There was no one responsible at the site, people were busy posing for pictures,” said a distraught Ahmed, who lost his mother, Dishad Begum, 75, who was also flying to Karachi for Eid.After scouring the site and failing to find his mother, Ahmed went to look for her in hospitals.“There was no list of the dead or injured at any of the hospitals, it was all chaos and mismanagement,” said Ahmed, who sobbed as he recounted the ordeal. “Searching for our mother’s body was a nightmare.”One of the survivors, engineer Muhammad Zubair, told Geo News the pilot came down to land, briefly touched down, then pulled up again.He announced he was going to make a second try shortly before the plane crashed, Zubair said from hospital.“I could hear screams from all directions. Kids and adults. All I could see was fire. I couldn’t see any people – just hear their screams,” he said.Rahmaan said his family was still in shock.“There’s no Eid in our home,” he said.Rahmaan said he took some comfort from knowing his parents always wanted to be with each other.“Whatever’s happened, whatever the reason behind it, they always wanted to be together. At the end, they were together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-eid-in-our-home-pakistani-families-mourn-crash-victims/story-irPRlt6yl7c3dnmfa5twWJ.html
25-05-2020||World||China denies using Coronavirus to grow presence in South China Sea||A look at recent developments in the South China Sea, where China is pitted against smaller neighbours in multiple territorial disputes over islands, coral reefs and lagoons. The waters are a major shipping route for global commerce and are rich in fish and possible oil and gas reserves.China’s foreign minister is dismissing claims that the country is exploiting the coronavirus outbreak to expand its footprint in the South China Sea, labelling such accusations as “sheer nonsense.”State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters at a news conference on Sunday that China was cooperating closely on anti-virus efforts with South-east Asian countries, several of whom have overlapping territorial claims with China in the strategically vital waterway.While China has long been stepping up its presence in the region, Wang said other countries, implying the United States and its allies, have been creating instability with military flights and sea patrols.“Their ill-intentioned and despicable moves are meant to sow discord between China and (South-east Asian countries) and undermine the hard-won stability in the region,” Wang said.China says it will increase its defence spending by 6.6% in 2020, despite a major downturn in the country’s economic growth due to the coronavirus outbreak.The increase is the lowest in years, but will still allow China to expand its ability to enforce its territorial claims in the South China Sea and grow its military presence in the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean. Another key priority is maintaining a credible threat against Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy China considers its own territory to be brought under its control by military force if necessary.Double-digit percentage increases of just a few years ago that have given China the second biggest defense budget in the world behind the U.S. Spending this year will total 1.3 trillion yuan ($180 billion), according to the website of the National People’s Congress, the ceremonial parliament that opened its annual session Friday.A study says South-east Asian countries are cutting defence spending as a result of the economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus outbreak, potentially opening up room for China to further assert its claims in the region.Aristyo Rizka Darmawan, a maritime security expert at the University of Indonesia, writes that slashing defence spending is seen as a relatively easy way to cut costs when countries are facing pressure on their budgets.“Indonesia, for example, has announced it will slash its defense budget this year by nearly US$588 million. Thailand has likewise reduced its defence allocation by $555 million. Malaysia, Vietnam, and the Philippines all face similar pressure,” Darmawan wrote in the online journal of the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank. “Less defence spending will invariably mean less patrols at sea.”China has maintained its presence in the South China Sea throughout the virus outbreak. Recent frictions include Chinese ships shadowing Malaysian mineral exploration operations and the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing boat by a Chinese maritime security vessel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-denies-using-coronavirus-to-grow-presence-in-south-china-sea/story-6FOBj1dMgk3QeeQHYMY32J.html

Please listen to the advice of emergency services and stay safe everyone,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on social media.Around 50,000 customers were without power on Monday due to storm-related outages, utility Western Power said, as the remnants of Cyclone Mangga hit a cold front and brought squalling rain and emergency level storm warnings to the south of the state.“New damage from the windborne debris has meant the overall number of impacted homes and businesses remains high,” it said on Twitter.More than 390 calls for assistance were made to the state’s emergency services since Sunday, mostly from the Perth metropolitan area, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services Chief Superintendent Danny Mosconi told ABC Radio.Pilbara Ports Authority said port operations in the Pilbara had not been affected, but elevated swell led to some minor shipping schedule changes at the Port of Dampier, which is used by Rio Tinto.The biggest oil and gas operators in WA, Chevron Corp , Woodside Petroleum and Santos, said there was no impact on their operations in the minerals-rich state.BHP Group said their was no major impact to its operations.

25-05-2020||World||Biden aims to move left without abandoning centrist roots||Joe Biden worked out deals with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. He defended Vice President Mike Pence as a “decent guy” and eulogized Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain’s “fairness, honesty, dignity, respect.”When he launched his presidential campaign, such overtures to Republicans were central to Biden’s promise to “unify the country” and “restore the soul of the nation” after defeating President Donald Trump.Now that he’s the presumptive Democratic nominee, Biden is sharpening his tone, still pitching consensus but touting a “bold agenda” aimed at mollifying progressives who remain skeptical he will deliver enough on health care, student loan debts and the climate crisis.The idea is to avoid repeating the party’s 2016 defeat, when Hillary Clinton struggled to unite her moderate supporters and backers of Bernie Sanders. The dynamics are different in 2020, with Democrats united in their antipathy toward Trump. But Biden’s juggling of the left wing along with mainstream Democrats and independents and Republicans disgruntled with Trump could end up as an unsuccessful attempt to be all things to all people.“It certainly seems like the approach that they’re taking right now is trying to have it both ways,” said Evan Weber, a co-founder of the Sunrise Movement, a climate action youth organization that is among the political groups working with the Biden campaign on policy proposals.For younger voters, Weber added, “Going too far in the direction of trying to appeal to a moderate narrative or a bipartisan era that most people in our generation have never experienced ... is not going to inspire a lot of confidence.”Republican pollster Whit Ayres countered that Biden’s “sweet spot” is the center-left.“You’ve got to run on who you are,” Ayres said. “If he becomes a politician of the left, it’s going to hurt his ability to consolidate the 54 per cent of Americans who voted for someone other than Donald Trump in 2016.”Biden deflects the risks. Asked whether his recent moves mean he’ll govern as a “progressive,” Biden retorted on CNBC: “I’m going to be Joe Biden. Look at my record.”Recent interviews and campaign events reveal the nuances Biden hopes can attract support in both directions. “I think health care is a right, not a privilege,” he said on CNBC, espousing an article of faith for the left. But, he added, “I do not support Medicare for All” single-payer insurance.Biden embraces some key principles of the Green New Deal sweeping climate plan as paths to “tens of millions of new jobs,” but casts as impossible some progressives’ goal of zeroing out carbon pollution over a single decade. He’s reaffirmed that he wants Republicans’ 2017 tax cuts repealed for the wealthiest individuals and corporations. But he prefers a 28 per cent corporate tax rate – still lower than what it was before the cuts – and he’s not embraced a “wealth” tax on the fortunes of the richest Americans. He opposes the Keystone XL pipeline while stopping short of backing an outright ban on fracking.The coronavirus pandemic has influenced Biden’s thinking, as well.Once a senator who championed a balanced budget amendment, he’s aligned with congressional Democrats pushing trillions of dollars in aid for states, local governments, business and individuals. And, adopting the tenor of erstwhile rivals like Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Biden has intensified his calls to rebuild the economy to reflect progressive values, including stamping out income inequalities baked into the pre-pandemic system.Biden aides say he’s uniquely positioned for a wide “Biden coalition” because voters prioritize experience and temperament, along with policy. The campaign defines his coalition as young, African Americans and Latinos, as well as suburban, college-educated whites, women and those disaffected by Trump.“We do not have to make a choice between one group or another group in terms of how we are going to win this,” Biden’s campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon said on a recent strategy call.Campaign co-chairman Cedric Richmond said Biden can stitch together otherwise irreconcilable parts of the electorate for one reason: Trump.“We have a president now with no discernible political philosophy other than what benefits him,” said Richmond, a Louisiana congressman. “Even people who are not as progressive (as Biden) and people who are more progressive at least like the consistency of knowing what a person believes in.”Anti-Trump conservatives offer similar sentiments.“We are living right now ... with the damage that can be done when a president is elected and thinks that he only has to answer to his base,” said Jennifer Horn of the Lincoln Project, which has produced online ads to help thwart Trump’s reelection.Even if Biden prevails in November, governing might prove tougher.Republicans who dislike Trump – the kind who cut deals with Sen. Biden or Vice President Biden – aren’t likely to back President Biden’s proposed “public option” health insurance expansion when they’ve never embraced the Affordable Care Act.The same goes for tax hikes and mega-spending energy packages the fossil fuel industry opposes. And within Biden’s personal base, labor unions whose jobs are anchored in existing energy markets haven’t embraced the sweeping alternatives.During the primary, Biden told skeptics in his own party he’d work with Republicans “without compromising our values,” but work to “beat them” in the 2022 midterms if that failed.Meanwhile, Weber, the Sunrise activist, argued that despite Biden’s embrace of some progressive priorities, “It’s hard to teach an old dog new tricks.”Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Republican Jeb Bush’s 2016 presidential campaign and a steadfast member of the GOP’s “Never Trump” faction, said more 2016 voters in decisive battleground states shunned both Trump and Clinton for center-right alternatives in Libertarian Gary Johnson or Independent Evan McMullen than Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Winning back just that cohort back could be enough to secure Biden to the presidency alone this cycle, he said.“I do think that there’s a concern that if he oversteps, overemphasizes a pivot to the left that could turn off certain voters who are gettable for him,” Miller said. “That’s going to be a continued tightrope through November.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-aims-to-move-left-without-abandoning-centrist-roots/story-gQmFYmVuJzgMOEyNdHraVK.html
25-05-2020||World||Hong Kong security chief warns of growing ‘terrorism’ as government backs Beijing’s planned security laws||Hong Kong’s security chief said “terrorism” was growing in the city, as government departments rallied on Monday behind Beijing’s plans to introduce national security laws and after thousands took to the streets to protest against the move.Police said they arrested more than 180 people on Sunday, when authorities fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse anti-government protesters as unrest returned to the Chinese-ruled city after months of relative calm. “Terrorism is growing in the city and activities which harm national security, such as ‘Hong Kong independence’, become more rampant,” Secretary for Security John Lee said in a statement.“In just a few months, Hong Kong has changed from one of the safest cities in the world to a city shrouded in the shadow of violence,” he said, adding national security laws were needed to safeguard the city’s prosperity and stability.Also read: China’s Wang Yi warns against foreign interference in Hong KongIn a return of the unrest that roiled Hong Kong last year, crowds thronged the streets of the city on Sunday in defiance of curbs imposed to contain the coronavirus, with chants of “Hong Kong independence, the only way out,” echoing through the streets.Calls for independence are anathema to Beijing, which considers Hong Kong an inalienable part of the country. The proposed new national security framework stresses Beijing’s intent “to prevent, stop and punish” such acts.Agencies issuing statements in support of the legislation included the Commissioner of Correctional Services, and Hong Kong Customs.Financial Secretary Paul Chan wrote on his blog on Sunday the national security law “itself” does not affect investor confidence, only the “misunderstanding” of it does.“The central government has already said the law is targeted at the minority of people who are suspected of threatening national security and will not affect the rights of the general public.”The United States, Australia, Britain, Canada and others have expressed concerns about the legislation, widely seen as a potential turning point for China’s freest city and one of the world’s leading financial hubs.Taiwan, which has become a refuge for a small but growing number of pro-democracy protesters fleeing Hong Kong, will provide the people of Hong Kong with “necessary assistance”, President Tsai Ing-wen said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-security-chief-warns-of-growing-terrorism-as-government-backs-beijing-s-planned-security-laws/story-ix4uCf9HWwTu7IJ9D02oeI.html
25-05-2020||World||Japan to end Tokyo’s state of emergency, eyes fresh $930 billion stimulus||Japan will lift a state of emergency for Tokyo and remaining areas still facing restrictions on Monday, while the Nikkei reported a plan for new stimulus worth almost $1 trillion to help companies ride out the coronavirus pandemic.Social distancing curbs were loosened for most of the country on May 14 as new infections fell, but the government had kept Tokyo and four other prefectures under watch.Japan’s economy minister told reporters on Monday the government had received approval from key advisers to remove the state of emergency for all remaining regions. It would be the first time the country has been completely free from the state of emergency since it was first declared a month and a half ago.“While the emergency state will be lifted, it is important to expand economic activity in stages as we establish a new way of living,” Yasutoshi Nishimura said. He added that the head of the advisory panel had recommended close monitoring of Tokyo, Kanagawa and Hokkaido prefectures, where cases had fluctuated.The world’s third-largest economy has escaped an explosive outbreak with some 17,000 infections and 825 deaths so far; however, the epidemic has tipped it into a recession and plunged Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s popularity to multi-year lows.An Asahi newspaper poll conducted at the weekend showed Abe’s support rate at 29 per cent - the lowest since he returned to power in late 2012 - and disapproval at 52 per cent. The results mirrored a Mainichi newspaper survey published on Saturday.Abe will hold a news conference at 6 pm (0900 GMT), followed by a government task force meeting. The lifting of the state of emergency takes effect after the meeting.Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has previously said the capital would move into “stage one” of loosening restrictions, once the state of emergency was removed. That would allow libraries and museums to reopen, and restaurants to stay open until later in the evening. Subsequent stages would see theatres, cinemas and fairgrounds reopen.Two-fifths of GDPTo support an economy on track for its deepest slump in postwar history, the government is considering fresh stimulus worth 100 trillion yen ($930 billion), mostly comprising financial aid for companies, the Nikkei newspaper said.The package, to be funded by a second supplementary budget, would follow a record 117 trillion yen spending plan deployed last month.The combined stimulus would bring the total spending in response to the pandemic to about 40 per cent of Japan’s gross domestic product.The new package would include 60 trillion yen to expand loan programmes that state-affiliated and private financial institutions offer to firms hit by virus, the Nikkei said. Another 27 trillion yen would be set aside for other aid including capital injections for ailing firms, the paper said.The government is expected to approve the budget, which will also include subsidies to help companies pay rent and wages, at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.Japan’s economy slipped into recession in the last quarter, and analysts expect another 22 per cent contraction in April-June.The deepening pain from the pandemic is forcing the government to add to Japan’s huge debt pile, which is already twice the size of its economy, to pay for big spending plans.The Bank of Japan expanded monetary stimulus for the second straight month in April and pledged to buy as many bonds as needed to keep borrowing costs at zero.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-end-tokyo-s-state-of-emergency-eyes-fresh-930-billion-stimulus/story-W9VSh47IOwWyOquYCAtcDP.html
25-05-2020||World||Taiwan promises ‘necessary assistance’ to Hong Kong’s people||Taiwan will provide the people of Hong Kong with “necessary assistance”, President Tsai Ing-wen said, after a resurgence in protests in the Chinese ruled territory against newly proposed national security legislation from Beijing.Taiwan has become a refuge for a small but growing number of pro-democracy protesters fleeing Hong Kong, which has been convulsed since last year by protests. Hong Kong police fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse thousands of people who rallied on Sunday to protest against Beijing’s plan to impose national security laws on the city.Writing on her Facebook page late on Sunday, Tsai said the proposed legislation was a serious threat to Hong Kong’s freedoms and judicial independence. Bullets and repression are not the way to deal with the aspirations of Hong Kong’s people for freedom and democracy, she added.“In face of the changing situation, the international community has proactively stretched out a helping hand to Hong Kong’s people,” Tsai wrote.Taiwan will “even more proactively perfect and forge ahead with relevant support work, and provide Hong Kong’s people with necessary assistance”, she wrote.Taiwan has no law on refugees that could be applied to Hong Kong protesters who seek asylum on the island. Its laws do promise, though, to help Hong Kong citizens whose safety and liberty are threatened for political reasons.The Hong Kong protests have won widespread sympathy in Taiwan, and the support for the protesters by Tsai and her administration have worsened already poor ties between Taipei and Beijing.China has accused supporters of Taiwan independence of colluding with the protesters.China believes Tsai to be a “separatist” bent on declaring the island’s formal independence. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-promises-necessary-assistance-to-hong-kong-s-people/story-4n6lUGJsUsG9DxgV8mIPgP.html
25-05-2020||World||White House goal on testing nursing homes for Covid-19 within 14 days unmet||Nearly two weeks ago the White House urged governors to ensure that every nursing home resident and staff member be tested for the coronavirus within 14 days.It’s not going to happen.A review by The Associated Press found that at least half of the states are not going to meet White House’s deadline and some aren’t even bothering to try.Only a handful of states, including West Virginia and Rhode Island, have said they’ve already tested every nursing home resident.Many states said the logistics, costs and manpower needs are too great to test all residents and staff in a two-week window. Some say they need another week or so, while others say they need much more time. California, the most populous state, said it is still working to release a plan that would ensure testing capacity for all residents and staff at skilled nursing facilities statewide.And still other states are questioning whether testing every nursing home resident and staff, regardless of any other factors, is a good use of time and money.“At this time it would be fairly useless to do that,” said Nebraska Chief Medical Officer Dr. Gary Anthone, adding that the state would have to repeat the tests almost daily to get more than a snapshot in time, and the state doesn’t have the capacity when there are others who need to be tested.Anthone said the state was going to stick with the CDC’s guidelines, which call for testing individually when nursing home residents show symptoms or collectively if there is a new confirmed case of Covid-19 in a home.The varying responses by states to nursing home testing is another example of the country’s patchwork response to the pandemic that also underscores the Trump administration’s limited influence. The president has preferred to offload key responsibilities and decisions to states and governors, despite calls for a coordinated national response.“All of this is probably not as well thought out as it could have been.” said Dr. Jim Wright, the medical director at a Virginia nursing home where dozens of residents have died. “It sounds more like an impulsive type of directive rather than one that has been completely vetted by providers on the ground.”On May 11, Trump heralded his administration’s efforts to boost coronavirus testing and said the U.S. had developed the “most advanced robust testing system in the world, by far.” That same day, Vice President Mike Pence hosted a private conference call with the state’s governors, where White House adviser Dr. Deborah Birx requested that each state target nursing homes to help lower the virus’ death toll.“Start now,” Pence added, according to a recording of the call obtained by the AP.Trump said later that day at a news conference that he was thinking of making it a mandatory requirement.“I think it’s very important to do and I think, frankly, some of the governors were very lax with respect to nursing homes,” Trump said.Birx acknowledged Friday that the two-week recommendation was a challenge but said it was needed because of the particular vulnerability of nursing homes.“We should never be discouraged by those who can’t get it done,” she said. “We should be encouraged by those who have shown us that it can be done.”Nursing homes residents, who are typically older and often have underlying medical conditions, have been particularly hard hit by the virus. More than 36,000 residents and staff have died from outbreaks at the nation’s nursing homes and long-term care facilities, according to an AP tally. . That is more than a third of all deaths in the U.S. that have been attributed to the virus.Nursing home operators have said the lack of testing kits and other resources have left them nearly powerless to stop the virus from entering their facilities because they haven’t been able to identity silent spreaders not showing symptoms.The American Health Care Association, the main nursing home trade group, said more than half of its members said they were unable to test all residents and staff within two weeks because of a lack of access to testing. The group also estimates that testing every nursing home resident and staff member would involving testing nearly 3 million people at a cost of $440 million.Even with the tests, nursing homes struggle to find people to administer them and carve out enough time to perform them.New York, one of the nation’s leaders in nursing home deaths, said this past week it has sent out enough kits to all nursing homes to test every resident though it remains unclear whether they will be done by the deadline.Delaware Gov. John Carney announced a plan May 5 for universal testing of all residents and staff in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, but the testing program is voluntary. On Friday, the state said three-quarters of long-term care facilities had requested testing kits, and that weekly testing of staff would be mandatory starting in June.Alabama State Health Officer Scott Harris said meeting the White House’s recommendation would mean testing 50,000 people in two weeks when it took three months for the state to test 150,000 people.“It’s just not possible,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-goal-on-testing-nursing-homes-for-covid-19-within-14-days-unmet/story-6NGfvidufAnEOQbYKiBjdL.html

It was strong enough to rattle food from shelves and stop train services.But there were no reports of major damage or injuries.Ardern continued on with her interview, telling the host the shaking had stopped.“We’re fine Ryan,” she said. “I’m not under any hanging lights, I look like I’m in a structurally sound place.”A 2011 quake in the city of Christchurch killed 185 people and destroyed much of the downtown area.

Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany says in a statement Sunday evening that the ban applies to foreign nationals who have been in Brazil in the 14 days before they sought to travel to the United States. McEnany cast it as a move by President Donald Trump “to protect our country.” Trump has already banned travel from the United Kingdom, Europe and China, all of which have been hit hard by the virus. Trump had said last week that he was considering imposing similar restrictions on Brazil. Brazil had reported more than 3,47,000 Covid-19 cases, second behind the US in the number of infections, according to a Johns Hopkins University count.

But their highest similarity to SARS-CoV-2 only reaches 79.8 %,” she said. At a media briefing Sunday, Chinese foreign minister rejected America’s “lies” over the coronavirus. A “political virus” is spreading in the US, causing politicians there to take very opportunity to attack and discredit China, Wang Yi said, speaking at his annual news conference on the sidelines of the ongoing session of the National People’s Conference (NCP), China’s legislature.“This political virus uses every opportunity to attack and discredit China. Some politicians have ignored the most basic facts and created too many lies and plotted too many conspiracies against China,” Wang said. China is open to international cooperation to identify the source of Covid-19 but any probe should be “free of political interference”, Yi further added. China, he said, was open to “…the international scientific community’s cooperation in virus tracing research. At the same time, we believe that this process should adhere to professionalism, fairness and constructiveness.”Wang said China and the US need to start coordinating macro policies for their respective economies as well as the world economy.The US should stop wasting precious time, he added.China remains prepared to work with the US in the spirit of cooperation and mutual respect, he said.The investigation should be led by scientists of the World Health Organization, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/virus-strains-on-bats-in-china-lab-not-matching-covid-19-director/story-kYfnRjdOVMasVz59jDEoiL.html
25-05-2020||World||Political virus spreading in US, leading to attacks on us, says China’s top diplomat||China is open to international cooperation to identify the source of the novel coronavirus but any probe should be “free of political interference”, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi said Sunday.China’s top diplomat, Wang heavily criticised the efforts of some US politicians to fabricate rumours and stigmatise China to blame it for the pandemic.The US is pushing relations with China to “the brink of a new Cold War”, Wang said, rejecting US “lies” over the coronavirus.He said a “political virus” is spreading in the US causing politicians there to take very opportunity to attack and discredit China.Defending the newly tabled security legislation on Hong Kong, Wang said it would target a narrow category of acts and would have no impact on the city’s freedoms or rights, or interests of foreign firms.Instead of being more worried, people should be more confident of Hong Kong’s stability, he said.Speaking at his annual news conference on the sidelines of the ongoing session of the National People’s Conference (NCP), China’s legislature, Wang touched upon wide range of topics including ties with the US, Russia and Japan and on international cooperation during the ongoing pandemic.Not surprisingly, he came out most strongly on ties with the US, saying a “political virus” was at play.“This political virus uses every opportunity to attack and discredit China. Some politicians have ignored the most basic facts and created too many lies and plotted too many conspiracies against China,” Wang said. “Unfortunately, in addition to the raging of the new coronavirus, a political virus is also spreading in the US. This political virus is to use every opportunity to attack and discredit China. Some politicians have ignored the most basic facts and made too many lies and plotted too many conspiracies against China,” he said.Wang’s comments come in the backdrop of rising tension between Beijing and Washington on a host of issues including the pandemic, Hong Kong’s political status and sale of US arms to Taiwan.Beijing and Washington engaged in a back-and -forth after the US criticised China’s handling of the outbreak, suggesting that it had come from a laboratory in Wuhan where the virus emerged late last year.He said China and the US need to start coordinating macro policies for their respective economies as well as the world economy.The US should stop wasting precious time, said Wang.China remains prepared to work with the US in the spirit of cooperation and mutual respect, he said.China, he said was open “…the international scientific community’s cooperation in virus tracing research. At the same time, we believe that this process should adhere to professionalism, fairness and constructiveness”.The investigation should be led by WHO scientists, he said.More than 12 billion masks have been exported to the US, which is equivalent to providing nearly 40 masks for each American, he said.Wang said China “launched the largest global emergency humanitarian operation in the history of New China” during the pandemic.He said China had provided emergency assistance to nearly 150 countries and exported 56.8 billion masks and 250 million pieces of protective clothing to the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/political-virus-spreading-in-us-leading-to-attacks-on-us-says-china-s-top-diplomat/story-hfmyS29MiO3OMtcLbl2IFM.html
25-05-2020||World||Ivanka Trump under fire for tweet on migrants||US presidential adviser Ivanka Trump’s praise of an Indian teenager’s bicycle ride home is drawing criticism in India for being insensitive to the plight of migrant workers struggling in a lockdown. The girl carried her father on the back of her bicycle for about a week for 1,200 km, the two said on Saturday, one of the many out-of-work migrant families leaving big cities for their homes in other parts of India because the shutdown has sapped their savings.“15-year-old Jyoti Kumari, carried her wounded father to their home village on the back of her bicycle covering +1,200 km over 7 days. This beautiful feat of endurance & love has captured the imagination of the Indian people and the cycling federation!” Ivanka, daughter of President Donald Trump, tweeted Friday. Also Watch | Bihar girl who carried father on cycle for 1200 km, gets a call for trialsIndia’s cycling federation, impressed with her endurance, has invited her for trials and said it could groom her into a cyclist, local media reported. But opposition leaders said Jyoti’s desperate journey home because of a crippling transport shutdown was hardly something to celebrate.“Her poverty & desperation are being glorified as if Jyoti cycled 1,200 KM for the thrill of it. Government failed her, that’s hardly something to trumpet as an achievement,” Omar Abdullah, a former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, tweeted in response to Ivanka’s message.According to relatives, Jyoti had to drop out of school due to financial crisis a few years ago.Darbhanga programme officer Sanjay Kumar Deo Kanhaiya, in Bihar, said on Saturday that Jyoti has been granted admission in class 9 at the government school in Singhwara block.The education department also gifted her a brand new cycle, along with a school dress, shoes, text books and stationary items on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ivanka-trump-under-fire-for-tweet-on-migrants/story-JRHjyWX2yjY0IfkeVqVjVM.html
