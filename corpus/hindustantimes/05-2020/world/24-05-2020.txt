Secretary (of State Mike) Pompeo will likely be unable to certify that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy and if that happens there will be sanctions that will be imposed on Hong Kong and China,” O’Brien said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-takeover-of-hong-kong-could-lead-to-us-sanctions-white-house-says/story-ES03FRQTWFXwPthEu4jrcO.html

24-05-2020||World||Americans soak up sun on beaches as coronavirus death toll nears 100,000||Americans sunbathed on beaches, fished from boats and strolled on boardwalks this holiday weekend, but the occasional person wearing a mask was a constant reminder that the world is still battling the coronavirus pandemic.The Memorial Day weekend that signals the start of the U.S. summer is normally a time when cemeteries across the nation fill with American flags and ceremonies to remember those who died in U.S. wars. This year the holiday week is when the U.S. death from COVID-19 is expected to exceed 100,000.The New York Times filled its entire front page with the names and selected details of 1,000 victims on Sunday to try to capture the humanity of the lives lost.“We were trying to capture that personal toll,” Marc Lacey, the newspaper’s national editor, told Reuters. “We were trying to humanize these numbers which keep growing and have reached such unfathomable heights that they’re really hard to grasp any more. ...This is about everyday people. It’s about a death toll, reaching a number that’s really just jaw-dropping.” Among the names, drawn from obituaries and death notices in hundreds of U.S. newspapers: Lila Fenwick, 87, the first black woman to graduate from Harvard Law; Romi Cohn, 91, saved 56 Jewish families from the Gestapo; Hailey Herrera, 25, budding therapist with a gift for empathy.All 50 states have relaxed coronavirus restrictions to some degree. In some states, like Illinois and New York, restaurants are still closed to in-person dining and hair salons remain shuttered. In many southern states, most businesses are open, with restrictions on capacity. Last week, 11 states reported a record number of new COVID-19 cases, including Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota, North Dakota, New Hampshire, Maryland, Maine, Nevada, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin, according to a Reuters tally. It is not clear if the cases are rising from more testing or a second wave of infections. Total U.S. cases are over 1.6 million, the highest in the world.A plea by health officials and many state governors to wear masks in stores and in public is being met with protest and resistance from some Americans. Social media is filled with videos of businesses turning away a few angry customers who refuse to cover their mouths and noses. “We need to be wearing masks in public when we cannot social distance. It’s really critically important we have the scientific evidence of how important mask-wearing is to prevent those droplets from reaching others,” Dr. Deborah Birx, response coordinator for the White House coronavirus task force, said on “Fox News Sunday.”Few people wore masks on Saturday while walking on a crowded boardwalk in Ocean City, Maryland. Masks were also a rare sight on other beaches, but people mainly kept their distance in small groups and avoided playing games like Frisbee and volleyball.“Personally, I’m not sure I’m worried about that, but for those who are worried ... I suggest they stay home. I like to get out,” said Bruce Clark at Daytona Beach in Florida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americans-soak-up-sun-on-beaches-as-coronavirus-death-toll-nears-100-000/story-6vZiVNnS8nbdasatadFYPL.html
24-05-2020||World||PM Boris resists calls to sack top aide after new claims emerge||Intense pressure mounted on Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday after new details emerged of his chief adviser Dominic Cummings breaching lockdown norms, with ruling party MPs, opposition leaders and tens of thousands of Britons demanding his resignation.Cummings, who has been a pivotal if controversial figure since the Vote Leave campaign spearheaded by Johnson before the 2016 EU referendum, is considered a driving force behind the prime minster in plans on Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic.Transport secretary Grant Shapps faced a tough time on Sunday television on BBC and Sky as he tried to defend Cummings, who travelled over 250 miles to Durham in end-March after he and his wife showed symptoms of the virus – breaching official advice to ‘stay home’.One rule for the people and another for those in power, Labour leaders and other protested, as some cabinet ministers – including chancellor Rushi Sunak – defended Cummings’ actions. Several ruling Conservative MPs broke ranks on Sunday to call for his resignation.A petition titled ‘Dominic Cummings must be sacked’ quickly gathered over 61,000 signatures.MPs across the political spectrum said their email inboxes were full of messages from angry people that they have been following official advice and depriving themselves of meeting close family members, even when they were dying, but Cummings felt entitled to break the ‘instructions’.Steve Baker, Conservative MP and a leading pro-Bexiteer, said: “Dominic Cummings must go before he does any more harm to the UK, the government, the prime minister, our institutions or the Conservative party”.“Today’s newspapers are a disaster. Enormous political capital is being expended saving someone who has boasted of making decisions beyond his competence and who clearly broke at the very least the guidance which kept mums and dads at home, without childcare from their parents, and instead risked spreading the virus by travelling”.“It is intolerable that Boris, Boris’s government and Boris’s programme should be harmed in this way”.Bakers remarks were backed by several party MPs, such as Caroline Nokes, who tweeted: “There cannot be one rule for most of us and wriggle room for others. My inbox is rammed with very angry constituents and I do not blame them. They have made difficult sacrifices over the course of the last nine weeks”.The prime minister’s spokesperson defended Cummings twice on Saturday, but Shapps denied new reports that Cummings travelled again to Durham after returning to London in mid-April, and was allegedly spotted in other places near Durham.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-boris-resists-calls-to-sack-top-aide-after-new-claims-emerge/story-NnPmqr8l1NmgqEUMr5FDEL.html
24-05-2020||World||‘Technical glitch or pilot’s error?’: Preliminary report of PIA plane crash raises doubts||A preliminary report on the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) plane crash, in which 97 people were killed, has raised serious questions about the pilot’s handling of the aircraft and what prevented the crew in the cockpit from informing the air traffic controllers about the troubles. Pakistani investigators are trying to find out if the crash of the national flag carrier’s flight PK-8303 is attributable to a pilot error or a technical glitch, with new leads raising fresh questions over the circumstances of the incident, Geo News reported. According to the report, prepared by the country’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the Airbus A-320’s engines had scraped the runway thrice on the pilot’s first attempt to land, causing friction and sparks recorded by the experts. After the third impact, the pilot took the aircraft off into the air again, which officials found very strange as the crew in the cockpit did not inform the Air Traffic Control (ATC) at the Jinnah International Airport of any problem with the landing gear, The News International quoted CAA sources as saying. Since automated emergency systems within the aircraft go off in case of any emergency, and the loud alarms and warnings are impossible to ignore, there was no indication from the pilot to the ATC that something was amiss, it said. When the aircraft scraped the ground on the first failed attempt at landing, the engine’s oil tank and fuel pump may have been damaged and started to leak, preventing the pilot from achieving the required thrust and speed to raise the aircraft to safety, the report said. The pilot made a decision “on his own” to undertake a “go-around” after he failed to land the first time. It was only during the go-around that the ATC was informed that landing gear was not deploying, it said. “The pilot was directed by the air traffic controller to take the aircraft to 3,000 feet, but he managed only 1,800. When the cockpit was reminded to go for the 3,000 feet level, the first officer said ‘we are trying’,” the report said. Experts said that the failure to achieve the directed height indicates that the engines were not responding. The aircraft, thereafter, tilted and crashed suddenly. “The plane descended too fast, almost plunged,” sources familiar with the report said. The investigators were trying to establish why the pilots not once informed the ATC of any emergency, malfunction, engine failure or fire despite the visible problems the aircraft was facing, the report said, adding that it is rare to have so many technical problems at the same time. The ATC’s conduct is also being probed. The report added that at this point, there are more questions than answers with the most serious being why and how the alarm systems inside the cockpit failed to warn the pilots of an impending emergency. PIA chief executive officer Arshad Malik has said that the black box of the plane has been handed over to the investigation team. The team, headed by Air Commodore Muhammad Usman Ghani, President of the Aircraft Accident and Investigation Board, is expected to submit a full report in about three months. According to the PIA’s engineering and maintenance department, the last check of the plane was done on March 21 this year and it had flown from Muscat to Lahore a day before the crash. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pakistan government had allowed the limited domestic flight operations from five major airports — Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta — from May 16. After the plane tragedy, the PIA has called off its domestic operation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-crash-technical-glitch-or-pilot-s-error-preliminary-report-of-pia-raises-new-questions/story-LAGDyXAQrFDcuyozQ8O7mI.html
24-05-2020||World||China’s Wang Yi warns against foreign interference in Hong Kong||Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sunday defended Beijing’s move to bring about a controversial new security law to firm up its control over Hong Kong and said that the excessive unlawful “foreign meddling” in the former British colony has placed China’s national security in serious jeopardy.Warning against any foreign interference in Hong Kong amid strong statement by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who called the new law “a death knell” to city’s freedom, Wang said Hong Kong affairs are China’s internal matter , and “no external interference will be tolerated.” Noting that excessive unlawful foreign meddling in Hong Kong affairs has placed China’s national security in serious jeopardy, Wang said that establishing and improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to safeguard national security has become a pressing priority, and must be done without the slightest delay.A draft bill on establishing and improving the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for the HKSAR to safeguard national security was tabled in the National People’s Congress (NPC) on Friday. It is expected to be passed on May 28.The bill is regarded as a political bombshell for the former British colony as China has decided to bypass the local Legislative Council to bring about a new national security law tailor-made to take control of Hong Kong which has been witnessing mass protests by pro-democracy groups since last year demanding autonomy and freedom from Beijing.As Wang addressed his annual press conference in Beijing, protests gripped Hong Kong on Sunday.Hong Kong police fired multiple rounds of tear gas and used a water cannon in the Causeway Bay shopping district on Sunday as thousands took to the streets to protest against China’s planned national security law, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.The protestors have denounced the proposed legislation as a threat to civil liberties and the end of the “one country, two systems” principle.Wang said the draft decision targets a narrow category of acts that seriously jeopardize national security.“It does not affect the high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong. It does not affect the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents. And it does not affect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors in Hong Kong,” Wang said. The central government is responsible for upholding national security, which is the same in any country, he said.The central government holds the primary and ultimate responsibility for national security in all sub-national administrative regions, which is the basic theory and principle underpinning national sovereignty and common practice in countries around the globe, he said.The adoption of the decision will start a legislative procedure, which will improve Hong Kong’s legal system, and bring more stability, stronger rule of law, and a better business environment to Hong Kong, Wang said, adding that the basic principle of “one country, two systems” and Hong Kong’s position as a global financial, trading and shipping centre will be protected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-wang-yi-warns-against-foreign-interference-in-hong-kong/story-QU0nQ9iuOoTTqu9br7C7EI.html
24-05-2020||World||Wuhan lab head calls coronavirus leak claims ‘pure fabrication’||Claims promoted by the Trump administration that the global coronavirus pandemic originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in the central Chinese city are a “pure fabrication,” the institute’s director said.Wang Yanyi was quoted by state media on Sunday as saying the institute did not have “any knowledge before that nor had we ever met, researched or kept the virus...We didn’t even know about the existence of the virus, so how could it be leaked from our lab when we didn’t have it?” President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have repeatedly said they suspect the virus that was first detected in Wuhan was somehow released from the laboratory.Most scientists say the pathogen that has infected 5.3 million and killed more than 342,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, was passed from bats to humans via an intermediary species likely sold at a wet market in Wuhan late last year.The virus’ toll continued to ebb in Asia and other parts of the world, with China on Sunday reporting three new confirmed cases and just 79 people remaining in treatment for COVID-19.The New York Times devoted Sunday’s entire front page to a long list of names of people who have died in the pandemic.The names and brief descriptions culled from obituaries from around the country fill six columns under the headline “U.S. Deaths Near 100,000, an Incalculable Loss.” “They Were Not Simply Names on a List. They Were Us,” read the subheadline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-lab-head-calls-coronavirus-leak-claims-pure-fabrication/story-2xvkTkuPBIfzZjs38aRz1I.html
24-05-2020||World||Muslims celebrate major holiday amid curfews, coronavirus fears||Muslims around the world on Sunday began celebrating Eid al-Fitr, a normally festive holiday marking the end of the fasting month of Ramzan, with millions under strict stay-at-home orders and many fearing renewed coronavirus outbreaks.The three-day holiday is usually a time of travel, family get-togethers and lavish daytime feasts after weeks of dawn-to-dusk fasting. But this year many of the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims will have to pray at home and make due with video calls.Some countries, including Turkey, Iraq and Jordan, have imposed round-the-clock holiday curfews. But even where many restrictions have been lifted, celebrations will be subdued because of fears of the pandemic and its economic fallout.Saudi Arabia, home to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, is under a complete lockdown, with residents only permitted to leave their homes to purchase food and medicine.In Jerusalem, Israeli police said they broke up an “illegal demonstration” and arrested two people outside the Al-Aqsa mosque, which Muslim authorities have closed for prayers since mid-March and will not reopen until after the holiday. Worshippers who tried to enter the compound scuffled with the police.Al-Aqsa is the third holiest site in Islam and would ordinarily welcome tens of thousands of worshippers during the Eid. The hilltop compound is also the holiest site for Jews, who know it as the Temple Mount. The site has long been a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Iran, which is battling the deadliest outbreak in the Middle East, allowed communal prayers at some mosques but cancelled the annual mass Eid prayers in Tehran led by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iran has reported over 130,000 cases and more than 7,000 deaths.In Dubai, the skyscraper-studded commercial hub in the UAE, authorities set up barricades and police checkpoints around an industrial area housing foreign labourers. The Emirates is trying to reopen its hard-hit economy, but cases continue to rise. The UAE has reported over 28,000 confirmed cases and 244 deaths.Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, has reported nearly 22,000 infections and 1,350 fatalities, the most in Southeast Asia. Lockdown orders intended to contain the pandemic mean there will be no congregational prayers at mosques or even open fields, no family reunions, no relatives bearing gifts for children.In neighbouring Muslim-majority Malaysia, businesses have mostly reopened after weeks of lockdown. But mass gatherings are still banned and people are not allowed to travel back to their hometowns for the holiday. Police have turned away more than 5,000 cars and have warned of strict penalties for those who try to sneak home.Malaysians are only allowed to visit relatives who live nearby, and only on Sunday, with gatherings limited to 20 people. Mosques have reopened but are limited to small congregations of up to 30. Malaysia has reported 7,185 infections and 115 deaths.In Pakistan, Eid is being celebrated in the shadow of the coronavirus and in the wake of a passenger plane crash near Karachi on Friday that killed 97 people.For the first time, Pakistan is celebrating Eid countrywide on the same day, ending an annual controversy between rival committees over the moon sighting that signals the start of the holiday.Pakistan has taken measures to control the spread of the coronavirus since mid-March, but Prime Minister Imran Khan refused to close mosques during Ramzan despite pleas from doctors and a rising number of infections. Pakistan has reported more than 52,000 cases and more than 1,100 deaths.More than 1,000 worshippers gathered and prayed shoulder-to-shoulder in an open field in Karachi on Sunday, with only a few of them wearing masks.In neighbouring Afghanistan, the government and Taliban insurgents announced a three-day cease-fire in honor of the holiday.Some 2,000 Muslims gathered for Eid al-Fitr prayers Sunday at a sports complex in the Paris suburb of Levallois-Perret, carefully spaced apart and wearing masks, according to France-Info radio. Traditional embraces were not allowed.France is allowing religious services to resume for the first time since March, but France’s leading Muslim organization, CFCM, advised mosques to stay closed Sunday. The CFCM said the government decree didn’t give mosques enough time to procure masks and hand gel to ensure that gatherings don’t turn into super-spreading events.Virus restrictions remain in place in the mostly-Muslim Balkan countries of Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo. In the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, mosques reopened on May 6 after seven weeks of lockdown. Worshippers must wear masks and practice social distancing, and older individuals were urged to continue praying at home.Naim Ternava, the mufti of Kosovo’s Islamic community, led prayers in a mosque in front of a small group of imams sitting 1.5 metres (yards) apart, with the sermon broadcast outside on loudspeakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/muslims-celebrate-major-holiday-amid-curfews-coronavirus-fears/story-WvEvNkeDBAyik1dhb8f1VL.html

His whereabouts were unknown until 1946, when British soldiers found him and gave him to the Soviet Union, the zoo said.“Almost immediately, the myth was born that he was allegedly in the collection of Hitler and not in the Berlin Zoo,” the zoo said in a statement.But, it noted, “animals are not involved in war and politics and it is absurd to blame them for human sins.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hitler-s-rumoured-alligator-dies-in-moscow/story-eLgdazlllfMleT0yyOdx3N.html
24-05-2020||World||Benjamin Netanyahu heads to court as first sitting Israeli PM on trial||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was heading to court Sunday to face corruption charges in the first criminal trial ever against a sitting Israeli leader.Netanyahu is set to appear at the opening hearing at a Jerusalem district court, after his request to have his lawyers represent him instead was rejected. The courthouse was drawing crowds of supporters, protesters and media hoping to witness Netanyahu enter the building, where he will hear the arraignment against him.The dramatic scene comes just days after the long-serving leader swore in his new government, breaking more than a year of political stalemate following three inconclusive elections.Netanyahu held his first Cabinet meeting with the new government just hours before heading to court. Neither he nor any of his ministers addressed the looming trial but the country’s outgoing religious affairs minister wished Netanyahu that “God will bring the truth out” at his trial.Netanyahu faces charges of fraud, breach of trust, and accepting bribes in a series of corruption cases stemming from ties to wealthy friends. He is accused of accepting lavish gifts and offering to grant favors to powerful media moguls in exchange for favorable coverage of him and his family. He denies the charges and has lashed out at the media, police, prosecution and courts of forging a conspiracy to oust him. It comes after years of scandals swirling around the family.Netanyahu and his allies have spent months lashing out the country’s law enforcement system, and the charges against him have deeply divided the nation.Ahead of the trial, two sets of protests and counter-protests gathered outside the courthouse and the prime minister’s official residence in Jerusalem. Netanyahu supporters outside the District Court in east Jerusalem wore masks with the prime minister’s face and held posters lambasting the attorney general who indicted him. Anti-Netanyahu demonstrators outside his residence blew trumpets and held a banner calling the longtime leader “crime minister.”Several of Netanyahu’s Likud party ministers, including the newly appointed internal security minister who overseas the police, said they would arrive to back him.Opposition leader Yair Lapid accused them of fomenting violence and trying to intimidate the judges. “Netanyahu is trying to drag us into a civil war to save himself from trial,” he told the YNet website.Netanyahu’s court appearance Sunday caps a three-year investigation. It also comes after more than a year of political turmoil, with three inconclusive elections — each seen as a referendum on Netanyahu — finally ending last month when the Israeli leader and his main rival, former army chief Benny Gantz, came to a power-sharing deal.As part of their power-sharing deal, Netanyahu will remain prime minister for the next 18 months, and alternative prime minister for the 18 months after, and will not be legally required to step down during what is expected to be a lengthy trial.Netanyahu’s proceedings were supposed to begin in March, but were delayed by his justice minister who issued restrictions on the courts amid the coronavirus crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/benjamin-netanyahu-heads-to-court-as-1st-sitting-israeli-pm-on-trial/story-EUFucdJvB8gLPOLj0OmyaJ.html
24-05-2020||World||Hong Kong police fire tear gas, water cannon at protesters||Hong Kong police fired tear gas and a water cannon at protesters in a popular shopping district on Sunday, as thousands took to the streets to march against China’s proposed tough national security legislation for the city.Pro-democracy supporters in Hong Kong have sharply criticised the proposal last week to enact a national security law that would ban secessionist and subversive activity, as well as foreign interference, in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. Critics say it goes against the “one country, two systems” framework that promises the city freedoms not found in mainland China.Crowds of demonstrators dressed in black gathered Sunday afternoon in Hong Kong’s Causeway Bay district to protest the proposed legislation. Protesters chanted slogans including “Stand with Hong Kong,” “Liberate Hong Kong” and “Revolution of our times.” The protest was a continuation of a monthslong pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong that began last year and has at times descended into violence between police and protesters.Police raised blue flags, warning protesters to disperse, before firing multiple rounds of tear gas. They later fired a water cannon at the protesters.At least 120 people were arrested, mostly on charges of unlawful assembly, police said in a Facebook post.They also said in a separate post that protesters threw bricks and splashed unidentified liquid at officers, injuring at least four members of the police’s media liaison team. They warned that such behavior is against the law and that police would pursue the matter.Earlier in the afternoon, prominent activist Tam Tak-chi was arrested during the protest for what police said was unauthorized assembly. Tam said he was giving a “health talk” and was exempt from social-distancing measures that prohibit gatherings of more than eight people.The bill that triggered Sunday’s rally was submitted at China’s national legislative session on Friday and is expected to be passed on May 28. It would bypass Hong Kong’s legislature and allow the city’s government to set up mainland agencies in the city that would make it possible for Chinese agents to arbitrarily arrest people for activities deemed to be pro-democracy.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called the move “a death knell for the high degree of autonomy” that Beijing promised the former British colony when it was returned to China in 1997.The erosion of Hong Kong’s freedoms prompted Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong prior to its handover to China, to condemn what he called “a new Chinese dictatorship.” “I think the Hong Kong people have been betrayed by China, which has proved once again that you can’t trust it further than you can throw it,” Patten said in an interview with The Times of London.Bernard Chan, a top-level Hong Kong politician and delegate to the National People’s Congress in Beijing, defended the national security legislation pushed by China, saying it was written into Hong Kong’s Basic Law — the city’s mini-constitution — but never enacted.Chan expressed concern that Hong Kong would inevitably face economic hardship given trade frictions between the US and China.“I think we are definitely the collateral damage being dragged into this thing. But then, I don’t think there’s any alternatives,” Chan said.“But with or without this law, honestly, the US and China are always going to be continuing this loggerhead for quite some time to come,” he said. “China will remain as a threat to the US in terms of the...world economic dominance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-fire-tear-gas-water-cannon-at-protesters/story-EiQCllrP7sUNOWc49dSYMI.html

Wang told reporters at a news conference that China was a victim of the global pandemic alongside other countries and had reached out to assist other governments in need.“To our regret, in addition to the raging of the new coronavirus, a political virus is also spreading in the US which is to take every chance to attack and discredit China,” Wang said.“Some US politicians, heedless of basic facts, have fabricated too many lies and plotted too many conspiracies,” Wang said.Raising such lawsuits “tramples on the international rule of law and abandons the human conscience. It’s untrue, unjustifiable and illegal,” Wang said.Those who would bring such litigation against China are “living in a daydream and will humiliate themselves,” Wang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-foreign-minister-says-coronavirus-lawsuits-illegal/story-uBJagXKoYgggkNMJsoB2rJ.html
24-05-2020||World||China warns US, says being pushed to ‘brink of new Cold War’; rejects ‘lies’ on coronavirus||The United States is pushing relations with China to “the brink of a new Cold War”, China’s foreign minster said Sunday, rejecting US “lies” over the coronavirus while saying Beijing was open to an international effort to find its source.Keeping up the worsening war of words with Washington over the pandemic and a Beijing move to tighten control over Hong Kong, Wang Yi said the United States had been infected by a “political virus” compelling figures there to continually attack China.“It has come to our attention that some political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new Cold War,” Wang told reporters during a press conference at China’s week-long annual parliamentary session.Longstanding friction between the two powers over trade, human rights and a range of other issues have been pushed to new heights since the virus outbreak.Wang did not identify what “forces” he was referring to, but US President Donald Trump has led world criticism of China’s initial response to the pandemic, which has caused more than 340,000 deaths and economic carnage worldwide.Trump and members of his administration have said China covered up the emergence of the virus late last year and bungled its initial response.Washington’s criticism has been widely seen in the United States as an attempt by Trump to divert attention from the White House’s own COVID-19 failures.Wang took an apparent swipe at the US struggles to contain the virus, which has now infected more people in the United States than anywhere else.“I call on the US to stop wasting time and stop wasting precious lives,” Wang said.He said China was “open” to international cooperation to identify the source of the novel coronavirus, but stressed that any investigation must be “free of political interference”.- ‘Stigmatising China’ -“Some political figures in the US rush to label the virus and politicise its origins, stigmatising China,” Wang said.Most scientists believe the virus jumped from animals to humans after emerging in China, possibly from a market in the central city of Wuhan where exotic animals were sold for meat.Governments including the US and Australia have called in recent weeks for an investigation into the exact origins of the virus.The World Health Organization has also called on Beijing to invite them in to investigate the source, with China proposing instead that the “global response” to COVID-19 should only be assessed when the pandemic is over.WHO members on Tuesday adopted a resolution, tabled by the European Union, at the UN body’s first virtual assembly to review the international handling of the pandemic, but it does not single out China.Wang said an investigation must “oppose any presumption of guilt”.“Aside from the devastation caused by the novel coronavirus, there is also a political virus spreading through the US,” he said.“This political virus is the use of every opportunity to attack and smear China. Some politicians completely disregard basic facts and have fabricated too many lies targeting China, and plotted too many conspiracies.”The introduction at China’s legislature on Friday of a proposal to impose a security law in Hong Kong to suppress the semi-autonomous city’s pro-democracy movement also has drawn US and world condemnation.But Wang defended the plan, saying it must be implemented “without the slightest delay”, adding that months of often-violent Hong Kong protests last year against China’s growing influence in the financial hub had “seriously endangered China’s national security”.bur-dma/amj||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-us-says-being-pushed-to-brink-of-new-cold-war-rejects-lies-on-coronavirus/story-qtGjFQmDtZibajzrUuPTNO.html
24-05-2020||World||Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine trial has 50% chance of success: Project leader||The University of Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine trial has only a 50% chance of success as the coronavirus seems to be fading rapidly in Britain, the professor co-leading the development of the vaccine has said.Oxford’s Jenner Institute has tied up with biopharma major AstraZeneca Plc to produce the vaccine on a mass scale if the results are successful.The experimental vaccine, known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, is one of the front-runners in the global race to provide protection against the new coronavirus causing the coronavirus pandemic.The upcoming trial, involving 10,000 volunteers, threatened to return “no result” due to low transmission of Covid-19 in the community, Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute, said.“It’s a race against the virus disappearing, and against time. At the moment, there’s a 50% chance that we get no result at all,” Hill said while speaking to the British newspaper, the Telegraph.Hill’s team began early-stage human trials of the vaccine in April, making it one of a handful to have reached that milestone.Earlier this week, the developers of the vaccine had described their efforts as progressing “very well”, moving to the next phase after completing 1,000 immunisations by its candidate-vaccine on healthy human adults.The next phase, the second in the typical three phases of trials that a vaccine goes through, involves enrolling up to 10,260 adults and children to assess the immune response to the vaccine in people of different ages and assess if there is a variation.The Oxford study is merging Phases II and III for speedier development. Phase III involves assessing how the vaccine works in a large number of people over the age of 18, and how well it prevents people from becoming infected and unwell with Covid-19.Adult participants in both the Phase II and Phase III groups will be randomised to receive one or two doses of either the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine or a licensed vaccine (MenACWY) that will be used as a “control” for comparison.The experts said ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is made from a virus (ChAdOx1), which is a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees, that has been genetically changed so that it is impossible for it to replicate in humans.Results of the animal trials of the vaccine on pre-print server bioRxiv had said that while the vaccine seemed to protect the monkeys from developing pneumonia, one of the conditions brought about by Covid-19 in people, it does not appear to stop them from being infected, nor prevent them from being transmitters.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-s-covid-19-vaccine-trial-has-50-chance-of-success-project-leader/story-q3fJfqYKDszlDd7qS4XjZP.html
24-05-2020||World||PIA aircraft hit runway, took off again before crashing: Report||It was supposed to be another regular flight on one of Pakistan’s busiest domestic routes between its two biggest cities.State-run Pakistan International Airlines Corp.’s PK 8303 flight had a normal departure from the eastern city of Lahore. Close to landing before 2:45 p.m. local time, the pilots told passengers to fasten their seat-belts as it approached Karachi’s airport in a flight that usually takes less than two hours. Everything was fine -- until the last few seconds.The plane began its descent. Instead of gliding on the runway, it hit the ground a few times -- for about 20 to 30 seconds -- before the pilots pulled the plane back up into the air again. It reached a maximum altitude of 3,175 feet about two minutes later, based on data by FWIW, the Flightradar24 website that tracks aircraft.The pilots added power and lifted off again, a manoeuvre known as a go-around. While a witness estimated it was aloft for 10 to 15 minutes longer, Flightradar24 data indicates it was nearing the ground 5 1/2 minutes later.It’s in that window that the pilots announced a second attempt to land. Calls for help were heard at the airport control tower.“Sir, we have lost engines,” the pilot said to a controller, according to a recording from LiveATC.net, which collects audio feeds from air-traffic staff. About 30 seconds later, the pilot again radioed a distress call: “Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.”On the last recorded position captured by a Flightradar24 ground station, the Airbus SE A320 jet was at an altitude of about 500 feet and descending.The plane, carrying 99 people, eventually smashed through rooftops of houses before finally crashing into a narrow lane of the residential area miles away from the airport that the runway was possibly in sight.“After the crash, there was fire everywhere, you could not see anyone,” said Muhammad Zubair, a survivor from the plane crash that killed 97 people. “I opened my seatbelt, and headed towards the light.”Zubair recounted the final moments before the accident to a local television channel. He was seated in the eighth row while the only other survivor, Zafar Masud, who’s the president of Bank of Punjab Ltd., was seated in the first row, various local news outlets said.Confusing CallsRescue workers entered the homes, recovered bodies from rooftops and also the crash site as smoke gathered in the area. Some bodies recovered had oxygen masks on, indicating that an emergency had been declared while the plane was in the air, according to rescue agency Edhi, Pakistan’s largest ambulance service.Edhi was first alerted by eyewitnesses, and said more people may have survived if it got the call to be on standby the minute the aircraft reported a problem, a practice that was followed in the past.“We were confused when people from the area called us,” Ahmed Edhi, a spokesman for the rescue agency, said by phone. “If they told us beforehand, many of our ambulances would have reached close to the airport before the crash.”The crash spread chaos and panic throughout the city that had already seen its health-care system chocked up by the coronavirus outbreak.Few TV channels initially offered hope about survivors, which led Usama Qureshi and a few friends to be on the road for eight hours until midnight, going from hospital to another. They waited along the footpaths of the main hospital as one ambulance after another brought bodies from the crash site, hoping to find the more than half a dozen people they knew who were on the flight.‘Painful to See’The first few bodies brought in from the crash site could be identified by families. “But after 15 to 20 ambulances, the condition got worse, it became very painful to see,” Qureshi said in an interview by phone. “I could not see anymore and thought I would just faint.”The mortuary at the hospital was at full capacity, and about a dozen ambulances with bodies from the crash were lined up outside, said Qureshi, co-founder of an engineering company Bolts Pvt.Among the people he was looking for was his friend Zain Polani, a banker who was on the flight with his wife and kids. He was also looking for the family of his former colleague.Some of the bodies have still not been identified a day and a half after the crash. That’s a pain point for families emotionally as it’s a common practice to hold final funeral prayers within hours or a day of death in Pakistan.“The families who have lost lives want to know what happened,” Pakistan’s Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said in a Karachi press briefing on Saturday. “We will make the report public as soon as soon as possible.”Pakistan has set up a four-member panel, which will submit its report on the disaster in three months, Khan said in a televised briefing.Pakistani authorities have found the flight data recorder of the airliner that crashed into the residential neighborhood but the search for the cockpit voice recorder is ongoing, Abdul Sattar Khokhar, a spokesman for the nation’s Civil Aviation Authority, said by phone. Airbus said it was providing technical assistance to France’s Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses and to Pakistani authorities in charge of the investigation.‘Technical Fault’The carrier’s Chief Executive Officer Arshad Malik said in a briefing the aircraft, which first entered service in 2004, passed all tests before the flight and went through a major check in March. The pilot had reported a “technical fault” before deciding to go around instead of landing, he said in a video message before visiting the crash site.It’s the second plane crash for the state-owned carrier in less than four years. Pakistan International’s chairman resigned in late 2016, less than a week after the crash of an ATR 42 turboprop killed 47 people. The airline, founded in 1946, suffered as many as 51 safety-related incidents before Friday’s crash, according to data from Aviation Safety Network. Still, Burzine Waghmar, a member of the Centre for the Study of Pakistan at SOAS University of London, called the airline’s maintenance and engineering “second to none.”A day later, it was supposed to be another regular flight. But not for market professional Arif Iqbal Faruqui, who lost his wife and three daughters in the crash. On board the same flight after the accident, a noise was heard, prompting fear from nervous passengers -- moments he captured on his phone.“The aircraft is showing problems,” he said in the video. “Passengers are tensed. A few have stood up and said they don’t want to go. Still they are insisting to take us.”That plane landed safely in Karachi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pia-aircraft-hit-runway-took-off-again-before-crashing-report/story-CJKdzsJoGnB7e8LwbpK3cO.html
24-05-2020||World||Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s corruption trial opens today in Jerusalem court||The corruption trial of Benjamin Netanyahu opens on Sunday in a Jerusalem court, where he will become the first serving Israeli prime minister to face criminal prosecution, in a case he calls a political witch-hunt.Netanyahu is required to appear for the session in Jerusalem District Court, a week after he was sworn in to a record fifth term as head of a unity government, ending more than a year of political deadlock in the wake of three inconclusive elections.He was indicted in November on bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges in three cases involving gifts from millionaire friends and allegedly seeking regulatory favours for media tycoons in return for favourable coverage.Netanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party, has cast his prosecution as a leftist witch-hunt meant to oust a popular right-wing leader.As prime minister, Netanyahu is under no legal obligation to resign and he has said his court battle will not affect his ability to do his job.A three-judge panel will hear his case. On Wednesday, it turned down his request to stay away from the opening session.In asking to be excused, Netanyahu called the event a formality and argued that bringing his contingent of bodyguards would waste public funds and make it hard to comply with social distancing rules.Some critics said Netanyahu was trying to avoid the optics of a prime minister sitting in the defendant’s dock.Turning down his request, the court said it was important for justice to be seen to be done.Six years ago, former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was found guilty of bribe-taking and served 16 months in jail. His trial took place after his 2006-2009 term in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-s-corruption-trial-opens-today-in-jerusalem-court/story-Rx7GKGDMArNge6BdDFBFNM.html
24-05-2020||World||Madagascar says its ‘green gold’ is go-to cure for Covid-19, experts sceptical||A drink made from a bright-green fern-like plant is being promoted in African countries as the go-to cure for COVID-19.But detractors, with undisguised scorn, dismiss claims for the concoction as at best useless -- and at worst dangerous.Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina is the promoter-in-chief of the substance, marketed as Covid-Organics and sold in the form of a herbal infusion.Asserting that the Madagascan brew has the potential to “change history”, Rajoelina has widely distributed it in his Indian Ocean island nation and exported it to many parts of Africa.The East African countries of Tanzania and the Comoros are among enthusiastic customers as well as Guinea-Bissau and Equatorial Guinea on the Atlantic coast.Guinea-Bissau President Umaro Sissoco Embalo made a point of personally taking delivery of his country’s Covid-Organics order at the airport.Artemisia annua has a long history in its native China, where scientists discovered an active ingredient that made the plant a front-line weapon in the fight against malaria.- Flying off shelves -Covid-Organics seems to be selling like hotcakes in Madagascar, costing 30 euro cents (35 US) for a 33-centilitre (11-ounce) bottle.In Senegal, Belgian agronomist Pierre Van Damme markets the product under the label Le Lion Vert (The Green Lion).“Since the start of the epidemic, demand for artemisia has gone through the roof,” Van Damme said. “But since the Madagascan president’s declarations it’s been crazy.” Sales jumped 15-fold in a few weeks, forcing Van Damme to hire eight staff to handle some 2,000 orders a day.As demand surges for the purported coronavirus remedy, prices have followed suit. Ibrahima Diop, a producer in the Dakar area, says the retail price has soared by two-thirds.“I’m swamped,” grinned Haoua Wardougou, an apothecary in a working-class district of the Chad capital N’Djamena. “I have lots of customers who want to buy some, but I’m out of stock.”Western doubtsThe counterpart to this enthusiasm is the cool reception that the drink has met in the West.The substance has proven effectiveness against malaria, but no clinical trials have tested it against COVID-19, either as a cure or as a preventative. In recent weeks, both the World Health Organization (WHO) and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have underscored the need for empirical testing of local formulas to demonstrate they are safe and effective as claimed.“We would be very proud if a solution in this war against COVID-19 comes from an African country,” said John Nkengasong, head of the Gabon-based Africa CDC. “But we must be methodical before approving such a remedy.”Some African countries are exercising caution, handing over their stocks of Covid-Organics for expert analysis.“They will be subjected to the same process as all other products before they are put on the market,” said Boss Mustapha, Nigeria’s point man in the fight against coronavirus. “There will be no exceptions.”Even in Madagascar, doubts persist. The dean of the medical faculty in the eastern city of Toamasina, Stephane Ralandison, warned against methods that were “not fully scientific” behind the Covid-Organics’ launch.“I am extremely cautious,” said sociologist Marcel Razafimahatratra, asking why the drink was not used in China, where the pandemic originated and where artemisia has long been used in traditional medicine.Clearly thrilled by his new continental fame, Rajoelina is an unabashed defender of Covid-Organics, charging that the West scorns the concoction because of its condescending attitude toward traditional African medicine.“If it was a European country that had actually discovered this remedy, would there be so much doubt? I don’t think so,” he told French media.For evidence he cites Madagascar’s coronavirus statistics: 405 cases including two deaths and 131 recoveries, according to the official count.‘Green gold’Rajoelina is touting artemisia as the new “green gold” for Madagascar, one of the world’s poorest countries. “Life will change for all Madagascans,” he said, noting that rice fetches $350 (320 euros) a tonne, while artemisia changes hands at nearly 10 times as much at $3,000 a tonne.A Madagascar-based company, Bionexx, has been producing artemisia since 2005 to fight malaria.Its CEO Charles Giblain is also convinced of a lucrative future for the crop.“This plant is a weed that can grow anywhere,” he said. “The only problem is to grow it in conditions that will make it competitive with Chinese rivals.”Bionexx is working to develop a hybrid to maximise the strength and effectiveness of wild Artemisia annua, with researcher Solofo Rasamiharimanana estimating that the quest could take four years.But many growers are far from convinced of its market potential.At the village of Ambohijoky on the outskirts of Antananarivo, farmers tempted by the crop quickly abandoned the effort.“We dropped it because of the prices,” said one of them, Louis Jean Patrice Rakotoninaina. “We were paid 1,050 ariary (27 cents, 25 euro cents) per kilo of dried artemisia while we expected to get 3,000 ariary.”Another, Eveline Raharimalala, said anything below 15,000 ariary was not worth growers’ while. She noted that artemisia takes six months to grow -- three times longer than other crops.Bionexx’s Giblain disputes the argument, saying: “If our prices weren’t attractive, we wouldn’t have 16,000 farmers working with us.”But one of the footsoldiers in this army of producers, Josephe Rakotondramanana, said a more important factor in growing the plant was to have a secure market.“We don’t grow artemisia for its price (but) because it’s a safe product with less risk of loss and zero need to stock,” said Rakotondramanana, who has worked with Bionexx for five years.Giblain for his part believes he is looking at Madagascar’s next vanilla -- the crop that accounts for 80 percent of world production.His ambition is to make his business, which currently produces 2,500 tonnes of artemisia per year, one of the world’s top three producers alongside Chinese rivals.Razafimahatratra, the sociologist, has his doubts.Rather than banking on a green miracle, he says, the Madagascar government should focus on ensuring food security for the former French colony’s 26 million people, 90 percent of whom live in grinding poverty.“Instead of importing 300,000 to a million tonnes of rice per year, the country should work to close this gap,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/madagascar-says-its-green-gold-is-go-to-cure-for-covid-19-experts-sceptical/story-sspw7cYw8bJmEaPQN1I17N.html
24-05-2020||World||Colombian businessman makes hospital bed-coffin combo to serve Covid-19 dead||Disturbing images of bodies of dozens of coronavirus victims awaiting burial on the streets of Ecuador’s largest city Guayaquil has motivated a businessman in neighbouring Colombia to design something he hopes would prevent a similar scenario in other countries: hospital beds that can be converted to coffins.Colombia’s health system so far has not been overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients - the country is coming to the end of two months of quarantine - but the pandemic has caused overcrowding at hospitals and funeral homes elsewhere.Worried his country’s health system might at some point be over-taxed, Rodolfo Gomez, whose company ABC Displays usually produces marketing material, designed the cardboard bed-coffins.“We saw what was happening in Ecuador, that people were taking dead family members out onto the streets...what’s happening also is that funeral services are collapsing with the pandemic,” said Gomez, 44. “So we started to develop a bed that could be converted into a coffin.”The beds have metal railings, wheels with brakes and can be inclined up and down. They can support up to 150 kg. (330 lbs.). He said the biodegradable bed-coffins cost between $92 and $132.Gomez hopes their low cost will mean local and provincial governments can outfit rural or under-funded hospitals cheaply. Converting them to coffins if a patient dies will also reduce possible contamination, he said.“Once the bodies are prepared it is converted to a coffin and covered,” said Gomez at his Bogota factory, which can produce up to 3,000 beds per month. “The staff who are nearby are not exposed to biological risk.”The first bed-coffins will be donated to the hospital in Leticia, an Amazonian Colombian city which has a high number of cases and limited hospital capacity.Gomez says he has already spoken to potential buyers in Peru, Chile, Brazil, Mexico and the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colombian-businessman-makes-hospital-bed-coffin-combo-to-serve-covid-19-dead/story-rKJYvJ0NLA3nTKWRSo2ERL.html

The rally came as the city’s government sought to reassure the public and foreign investors over the laws that sent a chill through financial markets and drew a rebuke from foreign governments, international human rights groups and some business lobbies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-throng-the-streets-of-hong-kong-to-protest-against-china-s-security-law/story-wiNYQmNIQa9u1vOZjPJxnL.html
24-05-2020||World||Politicians from 23 Nations criticise China’s plan to impose security law in Hong Kong||Almost 200 politicians and legislators from 23 countries issued a joint statement criticizing China’s plans to impose a sweeping national security law in Hong Kong, and warned that it could spark more protests in the city, Radio and Television Hong Kong reported.Signatories included Hong Kong’s last colonial governor, Chris Patten, and former British foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind, as well as five U.S. senators, and lawmakers from Europe, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, Canada and Australia, according to the report.China said it will introduce a law to prevent and punish any acts of secession, subversion or terrorism in the city that threaten national security. Pro-democracy activists say the move endangers the future of “one country, two systems,” the principle by which the Asian financial hub is overseen by Beijing.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the city would cooperate fully with China to enact the legislation. Her comments are likely to anger demonstrators and fuel protests that have resurged in recent weeks following months of disruption levelled by the coronavirus. Demonstrations were already planned against Beijing-backed legislation, including a bill that would criminalize disrespecting China’s national anthem, on Sunday and Wednesday.Key Developments:Here’s the latest (all times local):Senior city officials try to reassure on law (10 a.m.)Senior Hong Kong officials defended China’s plan to enact the law, with Financial Secretary Paul Chan saying it will help quell ongoing political unrest in the city, the main threat to confidence in the financial sector.“The freedom and rights enjoyed by the general public according to law are not interfered with, daily life will not be affected, and property security will continue to be effectively guaranteed,” Chan wrote in a Chinese-language post on his official website.In a separate post, Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung said on his website that the new legislation does not affect the principle of one country, two systems, in place since the 1997 handover. The city must ensure that the business investment environment is stable, Cheung wrote in the Chinese-language blog. “Social turmoil is the enemy of peace and happiness and investors,” he said.Global group of politicians condemns law (6 a.m.)A group of 199 legislators and prominent former politicians from 23 countries said in a joint statement that the principle of “one country, two systems” is hanging by a thread in Hong Kong and described the proposed security law as a “comprehensive assault on the city’s autonomy, rule of law, and fundamental freedoms.”The protests are driven by “the genuine grievances of ordinary Hongkongers” and that harsh laws will only escalate the situation, the group said in the statement on Sunday.Hong Kongers Won’t be Whisked Over Border, Official Says (2 p.m)The new security legislation won’t be used to whisk people over the border to China, Maria Tam, vice chairwoman of the Chinese parliamentary committee that oversees Hong Kong’s law, said in an interview.Tam acknowledged that some details of the sweeping legislation expected to soon be passed by the National People’s Congress had yet to be decided.“The Hong Kong opposition has always reaped the benefit of striking fear in the minds of the Hong Kong people and asking them not to trust China,” Tam said by phone. “And so this is political capital, and I would be surprised if they don’t cash in on it. But I don’t think it’s going to happen that way.”Police Warn of unauthorized marches (2:50 p.m.)Officers will be deployed around Hong Kong on Sunday at locations where unauthorized marches are due to take place and will arrest demonstrators if necessary, according to a post on the police Facebook page.The police urged residents not to take part in gatherings that are not approved, according to the post.They also warned that anyone who gathers in groups of more than eight would violate the city’s social-distancing measures, which pro-democracy advocates have complained are suppressing lawful protests.China tries to reassure city officials (12:35 p.m.)China tried to ease fears over the proposed legislation in a meeting between central government officials and city representatives, Radio Television Hong Kong reported, citing attendees.Vice Premier Han Zheng said at the meeting in Beijing that Beijing hoped to ensure the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong people were protected and maintained, RTHK said, citing local Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference member Thomas So. There would be a consultation process, the news agency quoted him as saying.Law is ‘anti-virus’ software for city: People’s Daily (Saturday 7:35 a.m.)China’s proposed security law for Hong Kong was “anti-virus software” for the city to enhance law and order, and to build a stable foundation for the principle of one country, two systems, the Communist Party-owned People’s Daily said in an online commentary on Saturday.The anti-extradition bill movement responsible for protests in the city was the cause of the National People’s Congress introducing the security-law legislation, it said.U.K. Australia, Canada foreign ministers express concern (11:45 p.m.)“Making such a law on Hong Kong’s behalf without the direct participation of its people, legislature or judiciary would clearly undermine the principle of ‘one country, two systems’, under which Hong Kong is guaranteed a high degree of autonomy,” according to joint statement from U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne and Canadian Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne.The U.K., Australia and Canada are “deeply concerned” at China’s proposals for introducing the legislation.Hassett warns of capital flight if laws enacted (10:39 a.m.)White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett called China’s move “very unacceptable to the U.S. government” and predicted it would backfire on Beijing.“They’re going to see a lot of economic harm from what they’re doing, because if I had capital to invest, would you really want to invest it in a place where they’re basically, you know, sneering at the rule of law the way they are right now?” he said Friday in an interview on Fox Business Network.“I would expect that they’re going to have serious capital flight problems in Hong Kong, if they follow through this, they will no longer be the financial center of Asia, and that they themselves will pay very, very heavy costs,” he added.China must respect Hong Kong’s freedoms, U.K. says (9:23 p.m.)Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the British government wants to clarify exactly what China has proposed -- but warned it expects Beijing to respect the autonomy Hong Kong is due.“We expect China to respect Hong Kong’s rights and freedoms and high degree of autonomy,” Johnson’s spokesman James Slack told reporters. The U.K. remains committed to upholding Hong Kong’s autonomy under the joint declaration, Slack said.The U.K. has previously said there will need to be a reassessment of relations with China in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak. On Friday, the government unveiled a plan to diversify supply chains, potentially reducing Britain’s reliance on China for some medical materials.U.S. condemns China’s plan to impose legislation on Hong Kong (8:30 p.m.)The U.S. condemns China’s “proposal to unilaterally and arbitrarily impose national security legislation on Hong Kong,” Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in an emailed statement. “The United States strongly urges Beijing to reconsider its disastrous proposal.”“The decision to bypass Hong Kong’s well-established legislative processes and ignore the will of the people of Hong Kong would be a death knell for the high degree of autonomy Beijing promised for Hong Kong under the Sino-British Joint Declaration, a UN-filed agreement,” the statement said.President Donald Trump had earlier warned that the U.S. would respond to the planned move in Beijing, amid escalating tensions between the two powers. “I don’t know what it is because nobody knows yet,” he told reporters at the White House about the possible Chinese actions. “If it happens, we’ll address that issue very strongly.”Activist Joshua Wong calls on international community (7:28 p.m.)Wong, one of the city’s most prominent activists, distributed fliers with a group of others outside the Hung Hom train station in Kowloon during the Friday evening rush hour. “We urge China to withdraw the evil bill,” he said, adding that it was “eroding the fundamental freedom of Hong Kongers.”Wong called on the global community to stand with the financial hub and said it was “time” for the U.S. to implement the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/politicians-from-23-nations-criticise-china-s-plan-to-impose-security-law-in-hong-kong/story-UK6rv18AQDxDrs6qotlvqM.html
24-05-2020||World||Wuhan lab had three live bat coronaviruses: Report||The Chinese virology institute in the city where COVID-19 first emerged has three live strains of bat coronavirus on-site, but none match the new contagion wreaking chaos across the world, its director has said.Scientists think COVID-19 -- which first emerged in Wuhan and has killed some 340,000 people worldwide -- originated in bats and could have been transmitted to people via another mammal.But the director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology told state broadcaster CGTN that claims made by US President Donald Trump and others the virus could have leaked from the facility were “pure fabrication”.In the interview filmed on May 13 but broadcast Saturday night, Wang Yanyi said the centre has “isolated and obtained some coronaviruses from bats.”“Now we have three strains of live viruses... But their highest similarity to SARS-CoV-2 only reaches 79.8 percent,” she said, referring to the coronavirus strain that causes COVID-19.One of their research teams, led by Professor Shi Zhengli, has been researching bat coronaviruses since 2004 and focused on the “source tracing of SARS”, the strain behind another virus outbreak nearly two decades ago.“We know that the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 is only 80 percent similar to that of SARS. It’s an obvious difference,” she said. “So, in Professor Shi’s past research, they didn’t pay attention to such viruses which are less similar to the SARS virus.”Conspiracy rumours that the biosafety lab was involved in the outbreak swirled online for months before Trump and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brought the theory into the mainstream by claiming that there is evidence the pathogen came from the institute.The lab has said it received samples of the then-unknown virus on December 30, determined the viral genome sequence on January 2 and submitted information on the pathogen to the WHO on January 11.Wang said in the interview that before it received samples in December, their team had never “encountered, researched or kept the virus.” “In fact, like everyone else, we didn’t even know the virus existed,” she said. “How could it have leaked from our lab when we never had it?”The World Health Organization said Washington had offered no evidence to support the “speculative” claims.In an interview with Scientific American, Shi said the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence did not match any of the bat coronaviruses her laboratory had previously collected and studied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-lab-had-three-live-bat-coronaviruses-report/story-kcTUNcJsIUEUjBn686nPMO.html
24-05-2020||World||4 Canadian political parties claim Covid-19 federal wage subsidy to keep afloat||Canada’s political parties, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s ruling Liberals, are taking advantage of a historic wage subsidy package that is meant to keep businesses afloat during the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy or CEWS was announced by Trudeau and costs the exchequer $ 73 billion Canadian dollars (CA). It offers eligible outfits, mainly companies, nearly CA$ 3,400 per employee per four-week period and was recently extended till August. It has now emerged that most of Canada’s major national parties are using the subsidy to keep their political operations going.A spokesperson for the ruling Liberal Party confirmed it had been approved for the wage subsidy, noting in a statement that it “has met the eligibility criteria for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy in recent weeks and received that support.” The media outlet CBC quoted a party spokesperson as saying that this was necessitated by the drop off in in-person fund-raising due to the restrictions that came into place in March to combat the coronavirus crisis.The Liberals are not alone in using public funds to keep their party offices open, even if virtually. The principal Opposition Conservative Party is also on the list of beneficiaries as is the New Democratic Party or NDP and the Green Party.The only party that has chosen to not use the opportunity is the Bloc Quebecois. In fact, its leader was sharply critical of the other parties dipping into the till. In a tweet in French, Yves-François Blanchet said, “In order to finance their next election campaign, multimillionaire parties like the Liberals and Conservatives are dipping into money from programmes meant for companies worried about going bankrupt.”All parties have suffered from the pandemic because of the inability to hold fund-raising events and the number of donors drying up due to financial stress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-canadian-political-parties-claim-covid-19-federal-wage-subsidy-to-keep-afloat/story-7U4zX0gqzH1Mkv4Nd8SYxM.html

With American shuttles no longer in use, the United States has had to rely on Russia for rides to the station.The NASA/SpaceX Commercial Crew flight test launch will carry NASA’s newest test pilots, Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken, in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.They’re scheduled to blast off at 4:33 p.m. EDT from launch pad 39A, the same one the Apollo astronauts used to get to the moon.The shift to private companies allows NASA to zero in on deep space travel. The space agency is working to return astronauts to the moon by 2024 under orders from the White House, but that deadline appears increasingly unlikely even as three newly chosen commercial teams rush to develop lunar landers. Mars also beckons.The White House portrayed the launch as an extension of Trump’s promise to reassert American dominance in space. He recently oversaw creation of the Space Force as the sixth branch of the armed forces.“Our destiny, beyond the Earth, is not only a matter of national identity, but a matter of national security,” Trump said in a statement.Vice President Mike Pence, who is chairman of the National Space Council, also plans to attend Wednesday’s launch.NASA has discouraged spectators, citing the pandemic, and is limiting the number of visitors inside the space center.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-to-attend-wednesday-s-nasa-astronaut-launch-in-florida/story-wKza1Uj0w6oIFKMMoX1VSJ.html
24-05-2020||World||US Navy successfully tests a laser weapon that can destroy aircraft mid-flight||A US Navy warship has successfully tested a new high-energy laser weapon that can destroy aircraft mid-flight, the Navy’s Pacific Fleet has announced. Images and videos provided by the Navy show the amphibious transport dock ship USS Portland executing “the first system-level implementation of a high-energy class solid-state laser” to disable an aerial drone aircraft, the Navy said in a statement on Friday.It did not give a specific location of the laser weapons system demonstrator (LWSD) test, saying only that it occurred in the Pacific on May 16. Navy ships face an increasing number of threats in conducting their missions, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, armed small boats, and adversary intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems.  Watch | US Navy successfully conducts laser weapon test, destroys unmanned drone  The US Navy has been developing directed-energy weapons (DEWs), to include lasers, since the 1960s. DEWs are defined as electromagnetic systems capable of converting chemical or electrical energy to radiated energy and focusing it on a target, resulting in physical damage that degrades, neutralises, defeats, or destroys an adversarial capability, the statement said. The Navy’s development of DEWs like the LWSD, provide immediate warfighter benefits and provide the commander increased decision space and response options. “By conducting advanced at sea tests against UAVs and small crafts, we will gain valuable information on the capabilities of the Solid State Laser Weapons System Demonstrator against potential threats,” Captain Karrey Sanders, commanding officer of Portland, said in the statement.“With this new advanced capability, we are redefining war at sea for the Navy.” The Navy says lasers, which it calls directed energy weapons (DEW), can be effective defences against drones or armed small boats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-successfully-tests-a-laser-weapon-that-can-destroy-aircraft-mid-flight/story-hHUtnzugX77Rh7r133EH1I.html

Brazil now ranks sixth in the world for fatalities.The country now has 3,47,398 confirmed cases of Covid-19, according to the country’s health ministry.The actual number of cases and deaths is believed to be higher than the official figures disclosed by the government, as Brazil’s testing capacity still lags.President Jair Bolsonaro has been fiercely criticised for his handling of the outbreak, which has led to the exit of two health ministers amid his insistence in opposing social distancing measures while advocating the use of unproven drugs for treatment.A video of a cabinet meeting in Brazil has emerged which has triggered outrage in the country. President Bolsonaro barely mentions the pandemic in the meeting, according to the video, which has fuelled a potentially explosive investigation.One of the few mentions of Covid-19 in the video was when the environment minister said the government should take advantage of the distraction created by the pandemic to relax the country’s environmental protection rules.Littered with obscenities, insults, tirades and potentially incriminating statements, the video triggered outcry in Brazil, where many questioned the government’s policy-making amid the pandemic.Brazilian media counted 39 swear words in all in the video, including 31 by the president. Bolsonaro called two state governors a “piece of shit” and “pile of manure” for defying him by imposing coronavirus stay-at-home measures, according to local media.The video’s existence emerged when popular justice minister Sergio Moro resigned two days after the meeting, accusing Bolsonaro of inappropriate “political interference” in the federal police.Police are reportedly investigating multiple cases involving Bolsonaro and his inner circle, including allegations that his son Carlos, a Rio de Janeiro city councilor, oversaw a fake-news campaign to benefit his father.Bolsonaro, meanwhile, denies trying to stifle investigations, and said the video proved the accusations against him were a “farce.”Meanwhile, the overall number of global coronavirus cases has increased to over 5.3 million, while the death toll surged past 3,42,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-sixth-worst-hit-in-world-sees-covid-19-curve-steepening/story-U2CM5C7FmFLqtaXdD8U56K.html
24-05-2020||World||Covid-19: New York Times devotes entire front page to list of virus victims||The New York Times has devoted Sunday’s entire front page to a long list of names of people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic.The names and brief descriptions culled from obituaries from around the country fill six columns under the headline “US Deaths Near 100,000, an Incalculable Loss,” with a subheadline reading: “They Were Not Simply Names on a List. They Were Us.”The all-text list takes the place of the usual articles, photographs and graphics in an effort to convey the vastness and variety of lives lost, according to Simone Landon, assistant editor of the graphics desk.A tally kept by Johns Hopkins University says more than 96,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the United States.Tom Bodkin, chief creative officer of The Times, said he did not remember any front pages without images, though there have been pages with only graphics, during his 40 years at the newspaper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-new-york-times-devotes-entire-front-page-to-list-of-virus-victims/story-Gz8qGKv1ip2nMA1U1H8M2O.html
24-05-2020||World||Covid-19: Trump wants places of worship to open, religious leaders divided||President Donald Trump used the words “this weekend” when he demanded Friday that states allow houses of worship to reopen. Robert Jeffress, an influential Texas evangelical pastor, spoke with Trump afterward and told him he didn’t plan to open his megachurch until June 7.“He wasn’t ordering every church to open,” said Jeffress, the senior minister at the First Baptist Church in Dallas who’s in regular contact with the president. “There’s no one-size-fits all.”Houses of worship, by nature centers for community, are eager to open -- especially when businesses like liquor stores, many complain, have been open throughout the deadly coronavirus pandemic. But the faithful, despite Trump’s desire to cater to them politically, appear to be moving cautiously.Jeffres, whose church spreads out across six blocks, plans to open only at 20% capacity. They will encourage mask-wearing and urge vulnerable populations, like the elderly, to continue to watch their popular services on TV or via livestream.“There is an insatiable hunger among Christians right now to get back to worship,” he said. “Yet they want to do it in a safe way.”Church Versus StateThat hunger has led to tensions with local officials. Several states have been the target of lawsuits, and on Friday a federal appeals court ruled that California churches must abide by Governor Gavin Newsom’s order to temporarily ban in-person religious services. Attorney General William Barr has threatened the state with legal action.“The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important essential places of faith to open right now,” Trump said in a statement on Friday. “If they don’t do it I will override the governors.”Congregation Etz Chaim, an Orthodox congregation in Los Angeles, immediately took Trump up on his word and sent an email out to congregants. It noted “with great pleasure and joy” that Sabbath services could begin again Friday evening.Still, its defiance -- in a city that has asked its residents to stay home -- came with masks and social distance.‘Potentially Destructive’Some religious leaders have criticized Trump for pushing too soon. In a signed letter to the president Saturday in the Washington Post, two evangelicals called his demand “both irresponsible and potentially destructive.”They noted outbreaks in churches in South Korea, Georgia, Texas and Arkansas. On Saturday, 40 cases were traced to a church in Frankfurt, Germany.Some local leaders have tried accommodate religious services, with more than half of states already loosening rules on houses of worship. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Thursday allowed groups of 10 to gather -- the number for a minyan, the quorum needed for Jewish worship -- if socially distanced.Some religious leaders say they simply won’t open until local leaders encourage them to do so.Yahya Luqman, the imam at the Fazl Mosque in Washington, D.C., part of a larger local Ahmadiyya congregation in the area, said they remain closed -- and will for the foreseeable future. The biggest Muslim festival of the year, Eid al-Fitr, takes place Sunday after a month of fasting.“We want people to have people safe and healthy and alive,” Luqman said. “Worship of God can occur at home, which is what we’re encouraging.”Touch NothingAt the start of May, Florida allowed houses of worship to reopen, and the First Presbyterian Church in Bonita Springs did so -- carefully.Doug Pratt, the senior pastor, said the church sanctuary holds 1,300 people but now seats between 100 and 300 for their two Sunday services.He said masks are encouraged. There is no choir, and no one can touch Bibles, psalm-books or church bulletins. The offering tray isn’t even passed.“If people want to make a contribution, the offering plate is sitting at the door,” Pratt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-trump-wants-places-of-worship-to-open-religious-leaders-divided/story-3QPVGQnvMySs7dCaCDNlNN.html

24-05-2020||World||N Korea to increase its nuclear firepower striking ability: Report||North Korea discussed new policies for increasing its “nuclear war deterrence” during a military meeting presided over by leader Kim Jong Un, state news agency KCNA reported Sunday.The report did not specify what the nuclear deterrence entailed, but said that “crucial measures” were taken at the meeting “for considerably increasing the firepower strike ability of the artillery pieces of the Korean People’s Army”.“Set forth at the meeting were new policies for further increasing the nuclear war deterrence of the country,” KCNA said.Discussions at the Central Military Commission meeting also centred on “putting the strategic armed forces on a high alert operation” in line with the “building and development of the armed forces of the country”.If the meeting, the date of which was not given, occurred in the last several days, it marks Kim’s first public appearance in almost three weeks, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap.In April, rumours swirled about Kim’s health after he was conspicuously absent from a mid-month celebration for the birthday of his grandfather, only to turn up weeks later at the opening of a fertiliser factory.News of North Korea’s nuclear discussions came after a report Friday in The Washington Post that US President Donald Trump’s administration had discussed holding the first US nuclear test since 1992 as a potential warning to Russia and China.Daryl Kimball, executive director of the US-based Arms Control Association, told the paper that such a decision would likely “disrupt” negotiations with Kim, “who may no longer feel compelled to honour his moratorium on nuclear testing”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/n-korea-discusses-new-policies-for-increasing-nuclear-war-deterrence-repot/story-WhrjyFI8bnN89Ed8RyxfHI.html
24-05-2020||World||Afghan Taliban announce three-day Eid ceasefire||The Taliban and Afghanistan’s president announced late Saturday a three-day cease-fire ahead of a major Islamic holiday that begins Sunday to mark the end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramzan. The Taliban order, which was soon followed by an announcement via Twitter from Afghan President Ashraf Ghani announcing the government “extends the offer of peace,” comes just days after US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was in Kabul and Doha. Khalilzad on his trip urged both the Taliban and the Afghan government to reduce violence and move ahead with intra-Afghan negotiations, a key pillar of a US peace deal with the Taliban signed in February to allow American troops to leave Afghanistan. The deal was also touted at the time as Afghanistan’s best chance for peace after nearly four decades of war. The Taliban’s cease-fire announcement follows an Eid al-Fitr message from the Taliban leader which said the insurgent group was committed to the peace deal, was not seeking to monopolize power and promised to guarantee the rights of women and men under an Islamic system. The directive ordered Taliban fighters not to fight but also not to fraternize with Afghan national security forces. The instructions seemed intended to avoid images that circulated during the last cease-fire in 2018, also during Eid celebrations, including Taliban fighters sharing ice cream and laughing with Afghan national security force soldiers. In instructions issued Saturday, Taliban fighters were told “not to attack the enemy in any place but if there is attack from enemy in any place then a befitting defensive response shall be given.” The order also warned Taliban fighters against entering “enemy” territory. Since signing the peace deal with the United States, the Taliban have not attacked US and NATO troops but have staged numerous attacks against Afghan National Security forces. The peace deal calls for the full withdrawal of US and NATO troops by the end of next year but only if the Taliban honour their commitment to fight against terrorist groups and guarantee that Afghanistan cannot be used as a staging ground of attacks against the United States and its allies. The agreement also calls for talks between Taliban and the often-bickering political leadership in Kabul to decide the future of a post-war Afghanistan. It also calls for the release of prisoners by both the government and Taliban as a good will gesture ahead of the talks. An increase in attacks claimed by the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, including a horrific attack on a maternity hospital in the Afghan capital last week, blamed on the IS affiliate, has given an urgency to finding a settlement between the government and Taliban. US Department of Defense officials speaking on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media, said the Taliban is seen as an asset in the fight against IS in Afghanistan. The US military in Afghanistan welcomed the cease-fire announcement saying “we reiterate our call for the militaries of all sides to reduce violence to allow the peace process to take hold.” (AP) SMN SMN||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-ghani-declare-three-day-cease-fire-for-eid-holiday/story-7W5xWIWblMsU4fLHjfz3cK.html
24-05-2020||World||South America is new Covid epicentre: WHO||The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared South America “a new epicentre” of the coronavirus pandemic while US President Donald Trump ramped up pressure on local governments to speed up the reopening of the reeling American economy.Surges in infections across much of Central and South America have driven the global case count to nearly 5.3 million, with more than 340,000 deaths, even as Europe and the US cautiously move into a recovery phase.The death toll in Brazil has soared past 20,000, and with 310,000 reported cases, it has the third-biggest caseload in the world behind the US and Russia.“South America has become a new epicentre for the disease,” WHO emergencies director Mike Ryan said on Friday. “We’ve seen many South American countries with increasing numbers of cases... but certainly the most affected is Brazil at this point.”Infections rose and ICUs were swamped in Mexico, Peru, Chile and Ecuador, countries lauded for imposing early shutdowns. Mexico passed 6,000 deaths on Wednesday. It recently reported more than 400 deaths a day. In Chile, more than 90% of intensive care beds were full last week in Santiago, where the main cemetery dug 1,000 graves to prepare for a wave of deaths. Peru has 2.5 intensive care beds per 100,000 people, one quarter of the global standard. Brazilians, meanwhile, got a shocking look at an expletive-laced meeting between President Jair Bolsonaro and his cabinet when a judge released a video at the centre of an investigation targeting the country’s leader. The video includes Bolsonaro using profanity to insult governors.In Washington, Trump ramped up pressure on local governments, saying, “The governors need to allow these essential places of faith to open right now. If they don’t do it, I will override the governors. In America, we need more prayer, not less.”Russia, meanwhile, has so far recorded 3,249 deaths - with a caseload of more 325,000 infections, second only to the US.Meanwhile, Spain’s PM Pedro Sanchez has announced that overseas visitors can return to the country from July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-america-is-new-epicentre-who/story-pvQ2xTI7PGZJ67DTOcSx9J.html
