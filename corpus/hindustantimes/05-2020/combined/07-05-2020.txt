07-05-2020||News||Usher in changes to ensure no Indian goes hungry | Opinion||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced pandemic has triggered a civilisational crisis with no immediate end in the sight. Many would reckon that India has done well to contain it. Yes, this is a crisis of enormous dimensions with extreme complexities. Lives are under threat, livelihoods are at stake, large reverse migration is underway, and the economy is in a tailspin with disruptions. This requires a multi-pronged response mechanism.The Union government, along with the state governments, is working on these lines. A national economic relief package has been announced, with more in the offing. The economy is being opened up incrementally. State governments are addressing migration woes. People are getting used to the idea of their homes being their second workplace. If there is one image of the national lockdown that has stayed with most of us, it is that of migrant labourers trudging to their respective home towns. Such episodes have been reported from Delhi, Mumbai, Surat, parts of Telangana, and elsewhere.More than 90% of the workforce is in the unorganised sector. In the lockdown, it’s the poorest and the marginalised who are hit the most. A United Nations University report says that 104 million more people could slip below the poverty line in India due to the crisis. An International Labour Organization report, on the other hand, says that around 400 million workers in the unorganised sector of India could sink further into poverty due to this.When the poorest don’t have enough for two square meals a day, it means that we, as a nation, have failed them. Look around and you will hear appalling stories of starvation deaths and malnourishment. All this will get exacerbated if the lockdown is extended.It’s generally believed that democracy, and a free Press, are the best guarantees against starvation. So, where have we failed? What can be done to ensure that starvation and hunger deaths don’t assume the form of a crisis in the uncertain times ahead?When I moved a private member’s resolution, advocating for a zero hunger Act in the Lok Sabha in 2006, I got overwhelming across-the-board support. A responsive political class, media, and civil society groups ensured that India got a National Food Security Act (NFSA) in 2013. It entitles 67% of the population (75% in rural India, and 50% in urban India) to five kg of food grains per person per month for priority households. The Act covers over 810 million people. During the lockdown, the government has increased the monthly quota of subsidised food grains to seven kg per person along with the free distribution of five kg food grains under the PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojna for the next three months. While the spread of the NFSA is welcome, more needs to be done. India ranks 72nd in a list of 113 countries in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s 2019 Global Food Security Index, where availability, affordability, quality and safety of food are measured. Or, the Global Hunger Index of 2019, which ranks India at the 102nd position in a list of 117 countries. As part of a long-term plan, India, like other countries, is working to end hunger, and eliminate malnutrition by 2030, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A 2019 Niti Aayog report says that Goa, Mizoram, Kerala, Chandigarh are among the states and Union territories that are doing well, but others are lagging behind.As India comes to terms with a new post-Covid-19 normal, we should work vigorously towards a hunger-free, malnourishment-free India well before the deadline. This must be the top priority as we rejig our priorities. While the SDGs with 2030 as the deadline were launched in 2016, countries like Brazil launched a war on hunger way back in 2003, with its pioneering “Fome Zero” (Zero Hunger) aimed at providing everyone enough food, and the right kind of food, for nutritional needs and well-being.We should use this crisis as an opportunity to undertake large-scale changes to be able to feed India, especially the most vulnerable sections, in the right manner. The five kg food grain quantum under the NFSA should be raised to 10kg going forward. The government could consider introducing breakfast, in addition to midday meals, in schools, to ensure that children are healthy. It’s time to make the NFSA coverage universal. The Food Corporation of India’s godowns are filled to capacity with more than three times the buffer stock it is required to maintain. In other words, no one going to a public distribution system shop must be turned away because of the absence of a ration card. Some states have already acted on this. A problem faced by migrant workers is that the ration cards from their places of origin are not valid in other states. The Union government is readying a “one nation, one ration card” scheme, and this needs to be prioritised. In the post-lockdown period, the issue has become particularly important, with large-scale reverse migration.Another important problem pertains to the linking of Aadhaar cards to ration cards. In many rural areas, the identification infrastructure often malfunctions. The glitches in the verification process must not become an excuse to deny someone food grains. We also need to universalise direct transfers to those living on the fringes.Let the Covid-19 crisis usher in policy changes that ensure that our poorest are well fed, their nourishment needs taken care of, and their dignity upheld. It is only then that India will be able to script an inclusive growth story.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/usher-in-changes-to-ensure-no-indian-goes-hungry-opinion/story-3wlcKRq5lI6G9oflgSQmsJ.html
07-05-2020||News||Covid-19: India is staring at a mental health crisis||The social and economic fissures exposed by the pandemic will result in mass unemployment, depleted social safety nets, starvation, increase in gender-based violence, homelessness, alcoholism, loan defaults and millions slipping into poverty. This post-Covid landscape will be a fertile breeding ground for an increase in chronic stress, anxiety, depression, alcohol dependence, and self-harm.As the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) continues to take lives across the world, there’s another public health crisis that’s rearing its ugly head. This new danger may perhaps unleash more death and despair than the coronavirus itself.Going by the history of pandemics, and the knock-on effects of an inevitable economic downturn, India is looking at a mental health crisis, with suicide-related deaths as its lead indicator.After the stock market crash of 1929, the suicide rate in the United States (US) rose 50%; to 18.1 per 100,000 from the 12.1 per 100,000 from 1920 to 1928 and stayed at 15.4 per 100,000 between 1930 and 1940. In 2008, researchers from the University of Oxford and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine noted an extra 10,000 “economic suicides” across the US, Canada and Europe, due to the financial crisis. These suicides were attributed to the economic hardships post-recession.The social and economic fissures exposed by the pandemic will result in mass unemployment, depleted social safety nets, starvation, increase in gender-based violence, homelessness, alcoholism, loan defaults and millions slipping into poverty. This will be a fertile breeding ground for an increase in chronic stress, anxiety, depression, alcohol dependence, and self-harm; leading to an overall rise in morbidity, suicides and the number of disability-adjusted life years linked to mental health.At-risk populations include the 150 million with pre-existing mental health issues, Covid-19 survivors, frontline medical workers, young people, differently abled people, women, workers in the unorganised sector, and the elderly.For a country with the highest number of poor and malnourished, and individuals with depression and anxiety, this is the perfect storm. How many suicides can we expect? India reported 1,34,516 suicides in 2018. Most independent estimates are far more. The World Health Organization (WHO) pegged 2016 suicides at 215,872, with a suicide rate of 16.5 suicides, against the global suicide rate of 10.5. History tells us that India should prepare for a large number of suicides, even in the thousands. Other than human suffering, suicide has an economic dimension, each death costs Rs 265,000 in the first year alone, says a study by Gopala Sarma Poduri in the Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine. Short-term costs include hospital expenses for the act leading to death, autopsy expenses, police investigations, funeral expenses, etc. Long-term costs include the lost income that could have been earned by the person till retirement, tax that the government lost from that income, among other things. Given that the second wave is expected, most of these deaths can be prevented.First, India can appoint a minister with a Cabinet rank as head of mental health and well-being, and create an emergency task force of public health experts in creating and executing evidence-based interventions.Second, work on a war footing to push to implement the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, (MHCA) that promises mental health care to all and introduce a suicide prevention policy. Many countries, including China, have been able to significantly reduce suicides after they implemented a suicide prevention policy.India’s investment in mental health — the last Union Budget slashed it by 20% from Rs 50 crore to Rs 40 crore — will need a boost. According to estimates, Rs 93,000 crore will be needed to implement MHCA, 2017. This could come from the PM Cares Fund, corporate social responsibility initiatives, private equity, and perhaps, a new national lottery.Rural India may be particularly susceptible to suicide due to the influx of migrant workers, and also because it is home to the at-risk farmer community. The central storage of pesticides in the farming community, decreasing the lethality of pesticides, and interventions to dissipate suicide contagions might be key.At the centre of this should be a large public engagement campaign to increase help-seeking. This must be centrally driven, supported by state governments, and endorsed by influential people. Mental health and suicide should be treated as a public health crisis that needs immediate fixing. Mainstream media and social media giants can be roped in to create and spread awareness.There is a good chance that alcohol addiction will rise after Covid-19. It will be beneficial to provide rehabilitation services that address both physical and psychological aspects. Community-based interventions such as Atmiyata’s community-based volunteers in Maharashtra and Gujarat, SCARF’s mental health mobile vans in Tamil Nadu, and Sangath’s VISHRAM, that used community health workers for the first line of treatment (depression fell by 22% and prevalence of suicidal thoughts fell by 51%), can be scaled.To reduce the pressure on the overworked primary and secondary mental health task force, the focus should be on self, family, community and primary care. Group psychological support for the unemployed through non-profits and the community will help. Training millions in suicide prevention techniques and combining crisis intervention by providing psychological first-aid will help save lives and reduce emotional distress, preventing long-term trauma.Digitally-mediated therapy and telepsychiatry (NIMHANS runs a successful telepsychiatry intervention in Karnataka) should be scaled up. A mental health startup incubator (funded by the Startup India programme) should provide the necessary impetus to spawn innovations that tap technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and chatbots. Use of low-tech like text messages can be highly effective in increasing awareness, decreasing stigma and inducing help-seeking behaviour.Finally, every crisis is an opportunity. The 1918 global flu epidemic stirred many European countries to create national health services. While mental health woes can shave off 3-4% of GDP, every dollar investment has a return of four-six times. Mental health and suicide prevention interventions can not only save lives, but also make immense economic sense.Nelson Vinod Moses is founder, Suicide Prevention India Foundation, and an independent journalistThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-india-is-staring-at-a-mental-health-crisis/story-hmBOzUYsbo3SmtlWilmBzL.html
07-05-2020||News||Covid-19: We need to restore the idea of village swaraj | Opinion||As the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) wreaks havoc across the world, India faces another massive challenge: How to ensure the safety and the well-being of its poor and marginalised living in urban agglomerations. Large employment centers such as Mumbai, Delhi and Ahmedabad are struggling to contain the spread of the deadly virus. The problem gets further complicated for those who live in congested slums and ghettos where social distancing is at best a misnomer. Add to that, the poor and migrants are unemployed, and, in the immediate future, face an uncertain future. It must be addressed. Perhaps, the issue does not need a brand new solution but the one that the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi had suggested: Gram swaraj – his talisman, the fruit of his life-long search for answers of India’s many ills. His pioneering idea of swaraj or self-rule emanated from the very foundation of the Indian society, its villages, and implied self-reliance. Gandhi envisioned his ideal village as a self-sufficient republic – independent of its neighbours for its own wants, and, yet, interdependent for those dependent on it.“I am convinced that if India is to attain true freedom and through India the world also, then sooner or later the fact must be recognised that the people will have to live in villages, not in towns, in huts, not in palaces,” he said.In 1929, he wrote in Young India: “We are inheritors of a rural civilisation. The vastness of our country, the vastness of the population, the situation and the climate of the country have, in my opinion, destined it for a rural civilization... To uproot it and substitute for it an urban civilization seems to me an impossibility.”The post-lockdown images of migrant labourers walking back on feet or thronging bus and train stations caused a massive furore. Migrants are aware that, without work, they can’t survive in cities. In contrast, in their villages, they have a well-established food supply and free shelter. Anyway, if they don’t have work in their destination cities, they have no good reasons to stay away from the family. Most of them are employed in low-end, low-value, hazardous work, which is further compounded by a lack of identity and legal protection. For them, villages are still a better option, with a social security net. Nearly one-fifth of India’s labour force – about 100 million – are migrants. Of this, a vast majority are from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (UP). In the case of UP, half a million workers from around the country have returned home after the lockdown. To make them financially independent, the UP government has constituted a committee of high-ranking civil servants which is trying to prop up the village economy. The committee has also been asked to adopt a holistic approach and develop short- and long-term plans for migrants.One of the first such tasks the UP government has taken is to reopen the closed and defunct mills, especially those in the food business – the flour, oil and pulse mills. It’s reviving small units such as dairies, and ensuring them security and support to employ the local workforce, and eventually, cater to foreign markets.The government is also trying to revive the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector, which has over 70 lakh units in the state – the largest share in the country. The MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh recently connected with over 100 US-based companies that showed interest in expanding their existing businesses in the state. “But they want us to introduce some relaxations in labour laws,” Singh told the press. Rebuilding the village economy can enable people to stay in their communities. Small scale industries, local mills, cottage and home-grown products can make this happen if supported with an efficient distribution system and conducive laws. According to British Governor in India, Sir Charles Metcalfe, “The village communities are little republics having nearly everything they want within themselves and almost independent of foreign relations. They seem to last where nothing else lasts.” Such an idyllic village life was lost to the pursuit of a modern India seeking city-centric industrialisation and economic activity. But all is not lost. Adversities can be turned into opportunities. The coronavirus pandemic offers one that could help us implement the ideals of villages in practice. It’s time we correct this anomaly.Shesh Narain Singh is a senior journalist, columnist and political analyst. He is political editor, Deshbandhu and Consultant, News18 India.

07-05-2020||News||First CPEC and now China’s Covid-19: Gilgit-Baltistan’s growing woes | Opinion||Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B), in proportion to population, has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in Pakistan. So far, 607 people have tested positive in a territory with less than one and half million people. Heroes like Dr. Osama Riaz and paramedic Malik Ashtar who unfortunately died while performing duties without virus protective kits have become a source to galvanize society. Locals blame the authorities for committing criminal negligence by not transporting Dr. Osama to Islamabad to save his life. Dismal economic condition and lack of preparedness could lead to more deaths in coming weeks.G-B is not a constitutional part of Pakistan and therefore survives on financial handouts from Islamabad. Locals including the Chief Minister, Hafiz Rehman, blames Islamabad for denying adequate funds to cope with the Covid-19 situation. Islamabad continues to reject provisions of protective gear with the excuse of fund shortage. Medical professionals are still not sure about the exact scope of positive cases as many people remain undetected due to faulty testing kits. Authorities warn that Islamic devotees returning from the Tablighi Jamaat congregation could stimulate local virus transmission.Locals are yet to benefit from the medical aid which military helicopters collect from the Chinese officials at the Khunjerav Pass. There is only one testing centre for the entire territory with capacity to test 15 people per day. At this rate, existing patients in Nagar alone, which is one of ten districts of G-B, would take eighty days to complete the process. Some hotels now function as quarantine centres but accommodate a small portion of patients. For now, G-B has only 15 ventilators for over 400 urgent-care patients and most of these ventilators were bought by local private donations. Transporting patients to Islamabad is cumbersome and economically impractical for most among locals.Naveed Murtaza, a local activist states that the people of District Hunza, which borders China, are protesting after failing to obtain stimulus fund. He said that videos have emerged of students of G-B sleeping on roadsides in Pakistan while waiting for government help. Local media reports ailing and starving prisoners and political activists protesting in different jails of G-B. “This is no way to thank G-B which provides for more than half of Pakistan’s water needs. Pakistan should take lead from other countries and immediately release political activists in these testing times”, says Naveed.Pakistan and China are using the pandemic to deepen control over G-B and squeeze more resources. Pakistani rulers call G-B country’s lifeline since CPEC related multi-billion dollar projects would fail without Gilgit facilitating border link between Pakistan and China. In the name of assisting local administration during the pandemic, Pakistan is expanding military presence and subjugating a territory that lawfully belongs to India. Pakistan’s behaviour is compelling a large majority of locals to demand withdrawal of its troops and seek complete independence. In the past, Pakistan sought help from Chinese army to quell such dissent. In 2010, media reported on the presence of eleven thousand Chinese troops in the region as part of CPEC security apparatus.Given the situation, people in G-B feel apprehensive about Chinese staffs resuming work on CPEC projects. Mohammad Lateef, a concerned activist from Skardo opines that locals fear the corridor will carry the virus deeper into the valleys. “Locals see CPEC as an instrument of invasion which destroys environment, culture and social fabric without much benefit to the people. They fear China will force concessions from Pakistan by using CPEC as debt weapon”, says Lateef. The merger of Macao and Hong Kong have taught China techniques to seek concessions from weaker nations to expand the Han empire. Hidden behind the testimonies of camaraderie, China plans to buy out assets in G-B, threatening freedoms, democratic values and national identities.Sajjad Raja, a political leader from Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (POJK) accuses Pakistani military of moving Covid-19 patients to Mirpur. Many among locals think that Pakistan is risking lives of millions of POJK natives to siphon money from the Western aid agencies, says Raja. Another local leader, Amjad Ayub attests that many hotels in POJK were now crowded with Pakistani patients. “Authorities forced local Mirpuris out of buildings and hospitals to accommodate Pakistanis. Staffs and equipment at Mohi-uddin Hospital were now at disposal of Pakistani patients while locals; wait for medical facilities, POJK belongs to India, and Pakistan has no right to abuse the territory to draw international attention”, exclaims Amjad.Ishaq Sharif, a leader from District Bagh reveals that Pakistan invaded and divided J&K by employing religious terrorism and now it is hurting locals by changing demography through Covid-19, “We are invaded by Pakistan army, not India. Entire world is praising India for securing ration for Kashmiris during Corona pandemic while Pakistan abuses its own people to attract international funds, Pakistan which does not miss a chance to abuse India is now begging PM Modi for ventilators and hydroxychloroquine. Seventy years of deprivation under Pakistani rule is now compelling people in POJK and G-B to look towards India for basics like food and medicines”, exclaims Ishaq.Jafar Ismail, a resident of Muzaffarabad says that Pakistani army continuously talks about Kashmir valley and its Corona patients to distract Pakistanis away from the dismal situation in POJK and G-B. Pakistan betrays the people of G-B and POJK. It has no will or capacity to fulfil demands of local Muslims yet pretends to care for the Muslims in Kashmir valley. He warns Pakistan was only interested in keeping Punjab safe and prosperous by filling coffers with earnings from POJK and G-B.(Senge H Sering is a Washington DC-based researcher and human rights activist born in Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan.

07-05-2020||News||Pakistan proxies in fight to the finish in Afghanistan, but India too needs to prep | Analysis||Aslam Farooqui, the so-called Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP) chief who was arrested on April 4, hasn’t really been singing like a canary as some expected. But he has spoken about his group’s links with Pakistani deep state, given interrogators an insight into the status of power struggle in Afghanistan and admitted how his fighters had been on the run and mostly, hiding in a eastern Afghanistan district. The big picture that has emerged from days of questioning at a location outside Kabul is that the Taliban will not share the spoils of power after the withdrawal of US armed forces from the country.The Taliban, he has told interrogators in the early days of his interrogation, has neutralised 90 percent of the ISKP group in Afghanistan. This onslaught has forced his remaining fighters to seek shelter in Achin district of Nangarhar province, which shares the border with Pakistan.It hasn’t helped the ISKP led by Farooqui, a Pashtun from Orakzai Agency, that the group largely comprises Pakistani nationals, right from those in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa area to Islamabad and Pak-occupied Kashmir. The Sunni Pashtun Taliban have been mercilessly battering the ISKP for trying to operate from Kandahar, Kunar, Nuristan and Nangarhar provinces.The Taliban, for the record, had promptly distanced itself from the March 25 attack on the Kabul gurdwara that killed more than 2 dozen Sikh worshippers. The attack was carried out by Farooqui group with a couple of radicalised Keralites from Kasargod involved in the massacre.The Taliban, after some hiccups, has started taking the first steps to implement the February 29 deal with the US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad that paves the way for the US and other foreign forces to quit Afghanistan. This pact requires the Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners. The Taliban, on the other hand, would free 1,000 Afghan security force personnel. The exchange was supposed to have happened by March 10.The Taliban released the first set of 20 Afghan security-force prisoners on Sunday, a development that the US special envoy described as an “important step in the peace process and the reduction of violence”.It is still early to predict the course of events in the volatile state of Afghanistan. But there is growing evidence that the country is heading from being a Islamic Republic to Islamic Emirate, where Sharia laws will apply and back to the days when Taliban took control of Kabul in 1996.Even though the US may have a limited footprint in the strife-torn country to manage its affairs in Central Asia, Pakistan and China, there are indications that the Taliban will not listen to its Pakistan, once its mentor, on every issue once it seizes power.“The Taliban is not a monolithic body. It may be united to seize power in Afghanistan but there are elements within it that completely oppose Pakistan and some are advocates of the Durand Line being made into the new border with its eastern neighbour,” said a senior analyst based in Kabul.That will complicate the situation for Islamabad.Just as Pakistan, India is also going into uncharted waters once again as it supports the current regime including its Northern Alliance friends from the past two decades, it will have to deal with Taliban when it comes to power. And that day is not too far away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/pakistan-proxies-in-fight-to-the-finish-in-afghanistan-but-india-too-needs-to-prep/story-ykhtNp5qte8WrAKyxFqP4N.html

Speaking to leaders of various parties on Thursday, he said that the first milestone in the fight against Covid-19 was surpassed successfully by April 30 but two more crucial stages until May end have to be faced.Thackeray held a meeting of leaders of 18 political parties in Maharashtra to discuss the Covid-19 outbreak in the state and measures that need to be taken to contain it. While discussing the exit plan for the ongoing lockdown, the CM hinted at the fourth extension of the lockdown after May 17 till the end of the month for MMR and Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). According to leaders who attended the meeting, the state government is expecting a spike in cases over the next few weeks and the downward trend is not expected during the ongoing phase of the lockdown. The leaders said that the government is aiming to clear the migrants from various districts by then.“Besides the other issues we brought to the notice of the government, we also demanded clarity on the exit plan for the ongoing lockdown. The CM apprised us about the measures taken to contain the spread in cities like Mumbai and augmentation of the health services by creating facilities with additional beds. He said that April 30, May 15 and May 31 are three milestones for MMR and PMR in the fight against the virus, one has been successfully faced and the remaining two will also be surpassed successfully,” said a leader, on the condition of anonymity.The meeting was attended by leaders of opposition from the BJP, Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi chief Prakash Ambedkar, Samajwadi Party chief Abu Asim Azmi, Peasant and Workers Party’s Jayant Patil, Communist Party of India (M)’s Ashok Dhawale, Lokbharti’s Kapil Patil, and Republican Party of India’s Rajendra Gavai via video conference. Besides the CM, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, and public works department minister Ashok Chavan represented the government.Former CM and leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis pointed at the lack of coordination between the administrative machinery, and change in the protocol of testing. He said that contact-tracing has slowed down and change in the policy of testing only symptomatic patients could prove fatal. “The Centre has given the highest financial assistance to Maharashtra. Instead of complaining about the Centre, the state government should announce stimulus packages to revive the economy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-likely-to-get-extended-in-mmr-and-pune-hints-cm-in-meeting-with-top-politicos/story-CJuez2IhIgGkCydQQ7hG0J.html

The police said that the man was isolated at a facility in Sector 9 after the arrest.According to the police, on May 1, a team of health officials went to Khandsa Mandi and took samples of multiple people and shopkeepers for testing. On May 4, when the results came, the team found that nine people, including the accused had tested positive for Covid-19. The police said that the officials then called each one of them and informed them about the results.In the police complaint, it was alleged that after coming to know about his condition, the accused decided to escape and go to his relative’s home in Sector 10.Subhash Boken, spokesperson, Gurugram police, said, “During the interrogation, the man said that he was worried and scared about being isolated. He ran away to his uncle’s house in Sector 10 and did not visit any other place.” He added that a team of police officers from the Shivaji Nagar police station and Sector 17 crime branch investigated the matter and located the accused after receiving a tip-off.“Once he recovers from the disease, we will take necessary action against him regarding the incident,” Boken added.Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer(CMO), said that they are investigating the matter and trying to trace people who came in contact with the accused.According to the health department, a total of 20 vegetable sellers have tested positive for Covid-19 at Khandsa Mandi so far. The vegetable market was shut down on Tuesday for sanitisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-man-escapes-after-testing-positive-for-covid-19-arrested-by-police/story-tWo9EjuYHOFlQWMc1qpAOJ.html

Two neighbours of a man who had allegedly killed himself in Rajeev Nagar after his wife was found positive for the infection, were also among the new Covid-19 positive cases.With the new cases, the total count of persons infected with the deadly coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the district reached 117 on Thursday. Out of this, at least 51 persons have recovered and discharged from various city hospitals. With 117 cases, Gurugram currently has the highest number of cases in Haryana.“Five family members of a Covid-19 positive patient, who works an ambulance driver in Delhi, have tested positive. They are residents of Jyoti Park area. A security guard and a nurse from the Sector 10 Civil Hospital have also tested positive for coronavirus,” said Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, Gurugram.“Two people in Rajeev Nagar, who are neighbours of the man who killed himself on April 27 have also contracted the virus,” he said. The man had allegedly killed himself, hours after his wife was confirmed Covid-19 positive. He later tested positive after the health department send his samples for RT-PCR testing. Three days later, his daughter-in-law also had tested positive for coronavirus.

Officials said the workers were screened for temperatures and flu-like symptoms before being allowed to start their journeys.The migrants, who worked in the city, had registered themselves online on a Haryana government portal seeking help to return home. They were called by the authorities to three designated spots on Wednesday, said officials.Over 108 buses had been sent by the Uttarakhand government which picked up the workers from Tau Devi Lal stadium, the Sector 12 bus stand, and Government Girls College in Sector 14. All the buses left the city between 5am and 10am.A district administration spokesperson said 2,978 migrant workers from Uttarakhand returned home on Wednesday. “Adequate arrangements were made for sending off the workers: 856 passengers left the Sector 12 bus stand in 38 buses, 45 buses took 1,396 passengers from Tau Devi Lal Stadium, and 726 passengers left from Sector 14 in 25 buses,” he added.Most of the workers are from Haridwar, Champawat and Rudrapur districts of Uttarakhand, officials said. Sanjay Yadav, duty magistrate, who oversaw the departure of migrant workers from the city bus stand, said the administration gave refreshments to the workers in the morning and packed food was given to them for lunch. “A team of doctors from the health department came in the morning and checked the temperatures and other health parameters of the migrants. Only those who are completely healthy were allowed to leave,” said Yadav.Yadav further said all norms of social distancing were followed during the entire exercise. ”Only 25 passengers were allowed in a 50-seater bus,” he added.The district administration also said the modalities for arranging the return of other migrants, who want to go back to their homes, are being worked out and tehsildar, Gurugram, has been appointed as the nodal officer for the process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nearly-3-000-stranded-migrant-workers-from-uttarakhand-leave-gurugram-for-home/story-Cz5tDv34wZXVUU7QB7MASM.html

On Thursday, Delhi reported 448 cases, which is the highest single-day increase so far in the city, taking the count to 5,980.The second-highest single day increase was recorded a day earlier with 428 cases.Another death was recorded, taking the total toll in the viral infection in the city to 66. Half of the deaths were among older people – 60 years or above. 91% of them had comorbid conditions.The doubling rate in Delhi has reduced from 13 to 11 days, according to Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain. “The doubling rate in Delhi has come down from 13 days around a few days back to 11 days now, but this is mainly because the reports of many pending samples in thousands are coming back now,” Jain said.Of the 3,983 presently living with the infection, 1,358 have been admitted to 10 designated Covid-19 hospitals in the city with severe symptoms. Of them, 87 are in intensive care units and 13 on ventilators. Another 1,230 people have been admitted to Covid Care Centres and Covid Health Centres with mild to moderate symptoms.A total of 771 people are under home isolation, the data shows.Over 5,000 samples were collected for Covid-19 testing on Thursday, the report shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/single-day-highest-spike-in-delhi-with-448-cases-city-20-short-of-6-000/story-kCsZC2WdMAmAkdzdbLHfMI.html
07-05-2020||Gurugram||Health department adds 600 beds to treat Covid-19 patients, allows home isolation of patients||With a spike in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the district this week, the administration, along with the health department, has roped in six private hospitals to add 600 beds to the existing capacity for the treatment of Covid-19 positive patients. The state health department has also permitted home isolation for those Covid-19 patients who have mild symptoms or are pre-symptomatic. However, home isolation has only been allowed if the patient has the requisite arrangements in the house.The decision to increase the capacity was taken after the number of Covid-19 cases in Gurugram reached 117. Of these patients, 66 are hospitalized and 51 have recovered.Apart from the 100-bed ESIC hospital in Sector 9A, the designated Covid-19 hospital in the district, where 56 patients are already undergoing treatment, the health department had also designated the 500-bed Medeor Hospital in Manesar for the same. But the facility is yet to be made operational.“Due to some technical issues in the Covid-19 isolation ward, the hospital is not yet functional. It will be functional from next week. Meanwhile, the district administration has asked six hospitals to keep 100 beds aside for Covid-19 patients,” Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer(CMO), said.The order issued by Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, six hospitals, namely Metro, Naryana, Signature, Columbia Asia, Park and W Pratiksha, will keep 100 beds each in their facility for Covid-19 patients. They will deploy their doctors, nurses and paramedical staff for the Covid-19 isolation ward in their respective hospitals.Earlier, coronavirus patients were being treated at Civil Hospital, Sector 10, and three private hospitals of the city. The health department recently declared the hospital Covid-19 free to resume OPD services. Also, four of its medical staff contracted the virus.Patients are now being admitted to ESIC hospital and SGT medical college in Chandu Budhera. HOME ISOLATION FOR PATIENTS WITH MILD SYMPTOMSThe state government also issued an order on Wednesday to treat Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms or who are pre-symptomatic under home isolation. The district health team, however, said they will grant permission only if the patient who tested positive for the coronavirus has appropriate facilities at the residence.“We won’t allow patients to go for home isolation until we see there are apt facilities, such as a separate room and a bathroom for the Covid-19 positive patient. It will also depend upon the treating physician and the consent of the patient. Generally, most of the patients want to be treated in a hospital facility,” said Punia, mentioning they will prefer home isolation for patients only if they don’t fear the spread of disease among other family members and nearby houses.As per the guidelines issued by the state government, a house has to have rooms for quarantining the other family members apart from the separate self-isolation room for the patient. A care giver has to be available to provide 24X7 services, who will also give daily update of the patient to the district health team.The health team will also monitor the health of the home isolated patients regularly. “On the first day of isolation, health workers like an ASHA worker or a medical officer will visit the house of the patient. A red poster will be displayed outside patient’s house, the patients’ hand will be stamped and masks will be provided. On every third day, these health workers will visit the patient’s house to check if there is any deterioration of symptoms and to check if the home isolation protocols are being followed,” said Punia.The caregiver and all family members living in that house will also have to monitor their body temperature daily and report if they develop any signs and symptoms to the doctor. As per the government protocol, the caregiver and all the close contacts of such cases will be given hydroxychloroquine for treatment.However, if there is difficulty in breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, mental confusion and bluish discolouration of lips and face, then the patient will be shifted to the hospital.Taking preventive measures, the caregiver, be it a health worker or a family member, will have to avoid exposure. For instance, the food has to be provided to the patient in his room, utensils and dishes has to be cleaned with soap/detergent and waterproof gloves. Utensils and dishes can be reused. They will have to avoid direct contact with body fluids of the patient and have to use disposable gloves while handling the patient.The surfaces in the home has to be cleaned like door knobs, handles and table tops with 1% hypochlorite solution.The patient, on the other hand, will have to use a triple layer mask and discard the mask after 8 hours or even before that if it is wet or visibly soiled. Basic hand hygiene needs to be practised. Patient has to take rest and drink lot of fluids to keep the body hydratedAs per the guideline, home isolation will end only after the patient has tested negative twice in the confirmatory tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-department-adds-600-beds-to-treat-covid-19-patients-allows-home-isolation-of-patients/story-siAYWlwLLHgt0w7HzHkZHM.html
07-05-2020||Gurugram||Maruti Suzuki to resume limited production at Manesar plant from May 12||Automobile manufacturer Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. will restart production from May 12 at its Manesar plant as economic activities slowly resume across the country following phase-wise exit from the nationwide lockdown. The auto giant had stopped production of vehicles at its three plants in Manesar and Gurugram in the third week of March after the lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of the deadly coronavirus disease (Covid-19).In a regulatory filing with the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the auto major on Wednesday stated it would resume limited production of vehicles at its Manesar plant from May 12. “All activities would be carried out strictly in accordance with the government regulations and guidelines and observing the company’s own concern for the highest standards of safety,” the statement said.A company spokesperson confirmed the development but did not share details regarding the number of workers that would be involved in the production at the Manesar plant. The spokesperson also did not divulge any details about the status of operation and production at the company’s plant in Udyog Vihar, Gurugram.Prior to the lockdown, Maruti Suzuki’s Manesar plant produced around 2,700 cars of different models, the spokesperson said.The decision to restart production at the Manesar plant is expected to help over 2,000 large and small firms in Gurugram and Manesar which are engaged in supplying auto parts and other services to the automobile company. “This is a positive development, and it will bring back employees to the shop floors. We also want the government to help medium and small enterprises in paying wages to the workers, but nothing is happening on that front,” Ashok Kohli, president, Chamber of Industries, Udyog Vihar, said.Manesar Industries Welfare Association (MIWA)— a traders’ body with over 150 firms engaged in the auto industry as members—said Maruti Suzuki and Hero MotoCorp are anchor industries in the city, and with the two companies resuming operations the region’s auto belt will revive. “Our members are enthused over this development, and it will boost economic activity n the region,” said Manmohan Gaind, vice president, MIWA. Two-wheeler manufacturer Hero MotoCorp commenced production at its Gurugram plant on Wednesday. The district administration on Saturday had given permission to Maruti Suzuki to start its operations with over 10,000 workers. Earlier on April 22, the company was given permission to resume limited operations for the maintenance of its plants in Gurugram and Manesar.Kuldip Janghu, president, Maruti Suzuki Kamgar Union, Gurugram said the employees of the company have been asked by the human resources department to get ready for a gradual resumption of production of vehicles. “As a large number of people work in the company, preparations are being made to ensure that physical distancing norms and other safety measures are implemented smoothly during the entry/exit of workers, on the shop floors and in canteens,” he said. Janghu added temperatures of employees will be checked at work and they will be screened for flu-like symptoms to minimise the spread of coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/maruti-suzuki-to-resume-limited-production-at-manesar-plant-from-may-12/story-kKkv88UeJ3Hlhz8xn9KKLK.html
07-05-2020||Gurugram||Haryana’s test positivity rate is low, but it isn’t declining, shows data||Of all samples tested for Covid-19 in Haryana (42,472 in all), just 1.47% are positive (as of May 7), according to government data. This is less than the national average of about 3.9%. Officials said this indicates that the spread of Covid-19 in Haryana has slowed, thanks to the lockdown and public health interventions. To support this claim, officials referred to a metric known as ‘Covid-19 positive rate’, a cumulative rate that has featured in the state’s daily epidemic bulletin since April 22. At the time, only 250 out of 13,647 tested samples (or 1.83%, the Covid-19 positive rate) came back positive. Despite testing numbers having increased since then, this rate has declined. As of Thursday, Haryana had conducted close to 42,500 tests, yielding 611 positive cases.Public health experts have, however, cautioned against using this metric to infer the severity of its outbreak. They said positivity rates are valuable only when compared on a daily basis, unlike the cumulative figure presented by the state.Experts pointed out that when analysed daily, Haryana’s positivity rate has not been declining. WHAT IS TEST POSITIVITY RATE (TPR)?A senior official in Haryana’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP), seeking anonymity, explained, “Covid-19 positive rate is the same as ‘test positivity rate’, or TPR. A decreasing TPR could indicate that the prevalence of Covid-19 in Haryana is lower, in comparison to other states which have a higher TPR, like Delhi.” This view was seconded by Dr. Dhruv Chaudhury, a nodal officer for Covid-19 at PGIMS Rohtak, one of the state’s accredited testing labs. Haryana’s lower TPR becomes all the more significant, he said, given that testing numbers have grown along with the widening of testing criteria.“Since March 14, Haryana has focused on testing only high-risk subjects, such as people in confirmed contact with Covid-19 patients, health workers, and residents in containment zones. This is known as public health testing. However, we have also started doing ‘health care testing’, where the focus is on patients hospitalised with symptoms of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) or influenza-like illnesses (ILI). So we are testing more high-risk subjects, while the percentage of them testing positive is decreasing,” Chaudhury added.Dr. Ram Prakash, district epidemiologist, Gurugram, said, “Going by the TPR, we assume that the prevalence of Covid-19 in Haryana is not as serious as it is in some other states.”HOW SHOULD TPR BE CALCULATED?Other experts, on the other hand, cautioned against this ‘narrow interpretation’ of data.Dr. Rajib Dasgupta, a public health expert at the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health, Jawaharlal Nehru University, said, “The trend of infected cases is a function of the number of people tested, and this trend must be compared daily. A cumulative total is akin to a cricket team’s score, say at the fall of the sixth wicket. This doesn’t tell us how each wicket partnership scored.”For example, when calculated on a daily basis—i.e. the percentage of new positive cases among new tests conducted—Haryana’s TPR on May 4 was 3.76% (the highest since testing numbers were ramped up in mid-April), as opposed to the 1.48% net positive rate mentioned in the state bulletin. On May 6, the state bulletin showed a cumulative TPR of 1.52%, which doesn’t reveal that 3.5% of new samples tested that day came back positive. “Haryana’s test positivity rate is relatively low, but it has not been declining as the official state bulletin seems to suggest,” Dasgupta said.Responding to this, Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary (health), Haryana, said, “Even the government of India is calculating test positivity ratio this way (using cumulative numbers). However, we are also calculating the TPR daily, and it is still quite low in percentage terms,” Arora said.WHAT DOES A LOWER TPR MEAN?According to Dr Prabhakaran Dorairaj, epidemiologist and vice president of research and policy at the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), a low TPR is desirable when accompanied by an increase in testing, especially in healthcare testing. “If this is the case in Haryana, then it may be a good sign,” he said. However, Dorairaj and other experts repeatedly emphasised that Haryana’s low TPR should not be taken as an indicator of the prevalence of Covid-19 among the population, given that many asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic cases are going undetected. In fact, a low TPR could also mean that tests are not being administered widely enough. “A low TPR could indicate a decreased transmission of the virus, or it could mean that you are testing the wrong people,” T Jacob John, a virologist and former chief of the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), said.If a state is testing subjects only through contact tracing, and finding an overwhelming majority of them to be negative, the subjects are not “truly real contacts”, John explained, advocating for an increase in health care testing over contact tracing. “Efficiency requires finding a higher percentage of positive cases. That means: increase health care testing and decrease in public health testing,” he added.Dasgupta echoed this view, saying, “TPR in the context of Covid-19 cannot tell us how severe the outbreak is. For that, one might look at the disease’s prevalence or mortality rates. But TPR can tell us a lot about the quality and strategy of public health surveillance. The daily test positivity rate for Haryana remained stable throughout mid-April, but has now begun showing increases. So the picture could look very different two weeks down the line.”BOX:1. The government data shows the test positivity rate (TPR) in Haryana has declined despite an increase in testing (1.48% on May 4, as opposed to 1.63% on April 22), leading them to believe that the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is declining in the state2. However, experts say that the government is using the cumulative number of administered tests to calculate the TPR, whereas the TPR must be calculated based on the number of daily tests. When calculated in this manner, the TPR in Haryana is found to have actually increased (3.76% on May 4, as opposed to 0.78% on April 22)3. Experts also emphasise that Haryana’s low TPR should not be taken as an indicator of the prevalence of Covid-19 among the population, given that many asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic cases are going undetected. In fact, a low TPR could also mean that tests are not being administered widely enough. 4. According to experts, just the TPR cannot tell us how severe the outbreak is. For that, one must look at the disease’s prevalence or mortality rates.TEST POSITIVITY RATE IN HARYANA(CUMULATIVE, AS PER STATE BULLETIN, SHOWS DECLINE)Apr 22: 1.63%Apr 23: 1.54%Apr 24: 1.51%Apr 25: 1.44%Apr 26: 1.37%Apr 27: 1.29%Apr 28: 1.20%Apr 29: 1.24%Apr 30: 1.29%May 1: 1.27%May 2: 1.25%May 3: 1.34May 4: 1.48%May 5: 1.47%May 6: 1.52%May 7: 1.47%TEST POSITIVITY RATE IN HARYANA(ANALYSED DAILY, SHOWS VARIATION)Apr 22: 0.78% Apr 23: 0.29 %Apr 24: 0.42 %Apr 25: 1.04%Apr 26: 0.62% Apr 27: 0.34%Apr 28: 0.37%Apr 29: 0.17%Apr 30: 1.76% May 1: 0.96%May 2: 0.95% May 3: 2.28%May 4: 3.76% [largest single day jump, 75 new cases]May 5: 1.08%May 6: 3.55%May 7: 0.94%||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-s-test-positivity-rate-is-low-but-it-isn-t-declining-shows-data/story-xpfGmKKuCSkvQGBPmJ06CM.html

The department has received several complaints from workers, seeking departmental intervention. The industries normally start disbursing salaries among the workers from the first of every month.Many industries disburse salaries within the first few days or latest by the seventh of every month. Some companies disburse their salaries by the 10th of every month.Ramesh Ahuja, deputy labour commissioner, said, “I have written to the industry owners, requesting them to pay the wages for the period of the lockdown as per the guidelines of the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) issued in March after a 21-day nationwide lockdown was announced to stop the spread of coronavirus disease(Covid-19). The entire country was put under National Disaster Management Act. The lockdown was later extended from May 3 to May 17.”The MHA, on March 29, issued a notification under the National Disaster Management Act, 2005, making it mandatory for industry owners to pay their workers wages during the period of lockdown. After the MHA notification, the state government also issued directions to all district heads to implement the order in letter and spirit.“I received more than 50 such complaints from workers who told us that their employers are refusing to pay wages of April. In my letter to industry owners, I have requested them to pay wages, drawing their attention to the guidelines of the MHA. In case, the workers do not get salaries by next Monday, I will write to my seniors for further action. But I believe that since the industry owners and workers are interdependent, they should mutually solve this issue since both the parties are equally affected by the current crisis,’ said Ahuja.The trade union council, on the other hand wrote to the labour department and the police, seeking official direction to the industry owners for wages of April.Kuldip Jhangu, general secretary of trade union council, said, “The council has received complaints from over 200 workers from Manesar, Udyog Vihar, Sector 37 and other areas in the past three days, stating that their owners are dilly-dallying in paying wages to them under one pretext or another. The MHA guidelines are to be followed mandatorily. Big industries of the district have already paid salaries of April.”Industry owners across the district said that their income has taken a severe hit due to the lockdown.“Many members of our association have complained that most of the workers did not join duties despite reminders after May 3 when the government allowed operations. We never said we will not pay salaries, but they should join duties and report to the management,” said Ashok Kohli, president of the Chamber of Industries, Udyog Vihar, adding that the trade union is trying to create a rift between industry owners and workers. Meanwhile, the MHA guidelines over the payment of salaries during the lockdown period have been challenged in the Supreme Court by a Mumbai-based industry owner and matter is pending at the court.Earlier, the industry owners have written a letter to Union government and state government, demanding a relief package since industries have been shut for over 45 days and their incomes are nil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/labour-department-writes-to-industry-owners-directs-them-to-pay-salaries-by-next-week/story-QOhWMPfGmJ7dWHR8jOJ7eJ.html

Ghaziabad on Thursday recorded four new Covid-19 cases taking the district’s total tally to 120. Overall, there has been an addition of more than 50 cases in six days — between May 1 to May 6.On May 1, the Ghaziabad district had been moved from Red zone to Orange zone, according to the classification issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare.The first case was reported in Ghaziabad on March 5 and the tally rose to 25 on April 8 in a span of about 34 days. The next 25 cases were reported by April 22, in a span of 14 days, taking the district’s total to 50. The number of samples taken for testing then stood at 1,923.However, the number of cases more than doubled by May 5, with a total of 104 cases being reported till the evening of that day (May 5). The last set of 50 patients turned positive within a span of about 13 days. The number of samples taken up for testing during that period stood at 3,573.“With the increase in number of cases, the classification of the district is likely to be affected and it is likely that Ghaziabad slips back into the Red zone. The ranking is dynamic and can change as per number of cases and other factors. I is highly unlikely that Ghaziabad will be able to move to the Green zone (districts having no cases in 21 days) any time soon,” said Dr AK Paliwal, state program manager from National Health Mission (UP) and nodal officer for Ghaziabad district.He added that more cases were coming to light as the number of testing had increased. Around 100-125 people were being tested daily now.In case the district goes into the Red zone again, the relaxations given under lockdown 3.0 may have to be rolled back. The district administration — under the relaxations provided — has directed for opening up of standalone shops, liquor shops, plying of cabs, industrial and construction activities, among others, in order to jump start the economy.“With the restrictions eased, people think that the threat from Covid-19 is over. But the threat remains and the virus is here to stay. It may take the form of an endemic again. The trend of positive cases is likely to increase further. It is about how we are able to contain it. It is in this anticipation that the state officials have asked districts to increase number of quarantine and Covid hospital beds,” Paliwal added.In their recent communications, the state officials had asked for an increase of about 52000 Covid beds and about 15,000-20,000 quarantine beds in each district to meet any contingency.The total number of samples taken for testing till May 6 stood at 3,737.“The cases are increasing at a fast pace in Ghaziabad and has affected areas like Khoda, Vaishali, Vijay Nagar and Indirapuram. Around 25% of the cases are due to medically acquired infection. With the increased number of cases, there is a likelihood that Ghaziabad may again fall into the Red zone,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.According to the Union health ministry’s classification, there are about 130 Red, 284 Orange and 319 Green zones across the country. The state of UP has 19 Red, 36 Orange and 20 green zones.The Red zones are areas with maximum number of Covid-19 cases. The government takes into account total number of active cases and case doubling rate, among others, before declaring an area as a Red zone.Places with no cases or where no case has been reported in 21 days are categorised as Green zones, while the areas not in Red or Green category are termed as Orange zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-cases-in-ghaziabad-doubled-in-13-days-officials-say-district-may-slip-back-into-red-zone/story-8KIeFc9qxqZ34dlFIUy99J.html
07-05-2020||Noida||GB Nagar ready-made garment export units get nod to operate||After several rounds of discussions, the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) and export promotion department of the Uttar Pradesh government, Thursday has asked the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration to allow over 600 ready-made garment exporting units to operate, provided they ensure that all the norms of Covid-19 are followed in these units.Secretary, MSME and export promotion, Navneet Sehgal, through a letter has sent a list of 611 ready-made garment exporting companies to the GB Nagar district administration Thursday, to allow them to operate in accordance with guidelines issued by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and the state government.“Due to outbreak of the Covid-19, most of the export orders of these units have either been cancelled or put on hold. Besides, their consignments already shipped out are also stuck. Even the ready-made garments manufactured against orders are lying factories because of a ban on the movement/transport of goods. If they will not be allowed to restart their units, it will certainly have the worst impact on our economy,” the letter said.GB Nagar district deputy commissioner (industries), Anil Kumar, said these 611 ready-made garment exporting units have been granted conditional permission. “It is mandatory for these units to strictly follow the social distancing norms. The unit owners will have to ensure that any person or item going in or out of their respective premises has been sanitised. These units will be operated with the minimum workforce needed,” he said.Kumar further said before starting the operation, it is mandatory for these units to conduct a random RT-PCR sampling of their employees, to ascertain that none of them is Covid-19 positive. “Any worker coming from containment zone will not be allowed into these units,” he said.Lalit Thukral, president of Noida Apparel Exports Cluster (NAEC), said with this order, the apparel and textile industry in the district will get a new lease of life. “The goods and payments amounting to around ₹7,000 crore of exporters would have tanked if activities had not been allowed to resume. We are hopeful to ship garments worth around ₹1,500 crore this month, which will bring some relief to entrepreneurs,” he said.He further said it will also enhance the productivity of exporters as buyers can now place new orders. “Since our industry is labour-centric, their return will also improve the overall socio-economic scenario. Even the financial burden on exporters will be eased as banks often increase our credit limits once we have new orders,” he said.The apparel sector in the district employs about 10 lakh people and the sector has exports to the tune of over ₹18,000 crore annually.Meanwhile, mobile phone manufacturing company OPPO will also resume production with a 30% workforce at its Greater Noida unit from Friday. As per the press release issued, the company will operate t 30% of its capacity, which is in accordance with the directive issued by the authorities. “It would be operating with around 3,000 employees working in shifts of its total 10,000 workforce,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-ready-made-garment-export-units-get-nod-to-operate/story-oKdU2fOR6DAqFSqHT2TRFP.html
07-05-2020||City||Factory owners seeking nod to open say they are being unduly harassed||Factory owners in Gautam Budh Nagar district, who are seeking a nod from the district administration to reopen their units, Thursday said they were being unduly harassed by officials and being made to stand in long queues to submit documents. They said the rules that govern the granting of permission to reopen industries are confusing and ambiguous, thereby defeating the purpose of social distancing to contain spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.All manufacturing units were shut after the government announced a nationwide lockdown from March 25 to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The lockdown has since been extended twice, the latest being up to May 17, but the Union government allowed lowed certain relaxation in lockdown rules from May 3 ( only in non-containment zones) to help businesses get back on their feet. In Gautam Budh Nagar, all businesses, factories, companies and offices in non containment zones were allowed to reopen, but with certain riders and only after the requisite nod from the industrial development department. Most factory owners, who manufacture electronic goods such as televisions, refrigerators, and also food products, said getting the nod from industrial development department was not a smooth process.“We were asked to apply for permission online and we did so. But nothing was processed as the system was faulty. Then the department of industry asked us to submit applications along with requisite documents at its office. We had to wait in long queues to submit the documents and the application. But we are yet to get the permission,” said Pankaj Singh, president, Greater Noida industry association.On Wednesday when factory owners visited the industry department at Greater Noida’s Surajpur office they were shocked by the chaos there -- all social distancing norms were being flouted at will.“This was unbelievable that in this time of crisis, when the government is emphasizing on paperless work and digitisation to ensure containment of the Covid-19, the industry owners are made to stand in long queues,” said Aditya Kumar, member, Greater Noida industry association. Anil Kumar, deputy commissioner of the District Industries Centre (DIC), who is the official in charge of granting permissions, did not reply to repeated messages and calls, seeking his comment on the system fault and flouting of social distancing norms.“District Industries Centre distributed forms to be filled to grant permission and then deny the permission. There is no communication from this department at all ,” Singh said. When apprised of this situation, GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said, “Nobody needs to be in a queue for permission. They can operate their units as per the rules laid down by the UP government. And if there is any miscommunication to industry owners then we will look into it and address the issue. I will ask Anil Kumar to communicate properly with industry owners.” Gautam Budh Nagar district has three industrial development authorities -- Noida, Greater Noida, Yamuna Expressway -- apart from the Uttar Pradesh state industrial development corporation (UPSIDC) that has the mandate to acquire the land, develop the same and allot it for setting up industries, housing and other purposes. Noida authority has around 20,000 hectares , Yamuna authority has around 16,000 hectares and Greater Noida has around 38,000 hectares developed by both the Greater Noida and the UPSIDC. In their respective areas, these bodies had allowed setting up industries of different kinds. The UPSIDC allotted land to at least 3,000 industrial units, which are located in Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/factory-owners-seeking-nod-to-open-say-they-are-being-unduly-harassed/story-Tfd6EZ1OvGEEaVoIpWtLgP.html
07-05-2020||Noida||Road accident injuries among animals spike in last two days as traffic returns, say animal NGOs||With an increase in number of vehicles returning to the road in the past two days, different animal welfare NGOs are receiving more cases of animals being injured, some seriously.Veterinarians have observed that animals had extended their territorial boundaries during the lockdown that was in force for 40 days. Due to this, these animals roamed freely even onto roads until last Monday when the lockdown was extended but with considerable relaxations, including allowing offices to open and vehicles to ply with a prescribed limit of passengers.While the district animal husbandry department said that they have not received any such complaints yet, a number of volunteers who had been feeding and treating the stray and community animals, especially dogs, say otherwise.“Just today we received some five cases of injured dogs and the cases had been rising for the past two days.There had been multiple cases of fractures and spine injury. It seemed that whatever hit them was moving too fast for the animals to react,” said Sanjay Kumar Mahapatra, head of Noida based NGO house of stray animals (HSA). Mahapatra, who runs a road side dispensary near sector 61, said that he had received more than 12 cases of road accidents in past two days.This, he said, pointed to speeding and rash driving.“We request people to drive slow,” he added.Other animal welfare organisations had similar stories to tell.“We have treated about six dogs with spine split in two halves over past two days. One dog died. This happens when dogs are run over, or the cars are too fast or the driver is drunk. They find wide open roads as traffic is still not up to what it was before the lockdown was announced on March 25, and they drive fast with dogs falling prey to their speed,” said Kaveri Rana, president, People for Animals (PFA), Gautam Budh Nagar.According to veterinarians, it’s a tendency of animal to extend their territory wherever there are fewer human activity.“We see more dogs sitting covering the road and this is because there were fewer vehicles on the road. For this, a lot of feeders are also responsible as we have seen them feeding either on road, or by the roadside, while they should be feeding them a little away from the road or by a park. This encourages dogs to extend their territory to roads and thus with vehicles now returning back, they get hit. This will take some time before the animals understand that roads are not their territory,” said says Dr Abhishek Dabar, official vet at Noida authority’s animal at sector-94.Meanwhile, officials said that they have not received any such report.“So far we have not received any report of road accidents, though if happens we are ready to treat such animals. It’s obvious that when there will be traffic on the roads there will also be cars. Though not the animals, but I have seen three car accidents since yesterday while returning from Vikas Bhawan,” said VK Srivastava, chief veterinary officer, GB Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/road-accident-injuries-among-animals-spike-in-last-two-days-as-traffic-returns-say-animal-ngos/story-TfVwn0523Xc2xNj3oRAM6J.html
07-05-2020||City||Drone camera spots 10 persons out strolling; all booked||A drone camera spotted ten persons strolling in two groups in Greater Noida. Based on the aerial images, the police booked all of them for violating the lockdown. Dinesh Kumar Singh, a sub-inspector at Dankaur police station, said that police teams are enforcing the lockdown in the area. “The police teams physically patrol the roads and make use of aerial surveillance via drone cameras. Singh said that on Wednesday, a police team was flying a drone camera near Jhajahar road in Dankaur. “The camera spotted a group of five persons roaming about. The police team drove to the spot and found them sitting together. We questioned them but they did not give satisfactorily answer why they were outdoors in a group during the lockdown,” he said. The five suspects were identified as Dalchand, Kartar Bhati, Ravindra, Bharat and Vikram, all residents of Salarpur village in Dankaur. The police registered a case against them under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). In the second case, the drone camera spotted five other persons—Vikas, Dinesh, Raju, Fakhruddin and Bhoora—residents of Junaidpur village, roaming about. Vikas and Dinesh were riding a motorcycle while the other three were on foot. Rajneesh Tiwari, station house officer, Dankaur police station, said that police teams are trying to ensure complete enforcement in the area. “The police patrol areas and advise people to stay home. But there are still some people who walk about without a valid reason. We fly drone camera at the crossings, markets, outside academic institutions, etc., spot suspicious persons and register FIR against them,” he said. Once these suspects are held, they apologise and promise not to venture out again, he added. Tiwari said that all the 10 persons were released after a warning there would be stricter action if the violation is repeated. “Section 188 of the IPC does not require the immediate arrest of the suspects. We will inform the district and sessions court, Surajpur. The court will then summon them to join the proceedings,” he said. On Wednesday, the Gautam Budh Nagar Police had registered 20 FIRs and arrested 14 persons. The police also checked 754 vehicles and issued fines to 223 vehicles and seized six of them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/drone-camera-spots-10-persons-out-strolling-all-booked/story-lCeU2otr3afoYkT77I2JSO.html
07-05-2020||City||‘Appeal’ by Gzb officials to restrict doctors, HCWs to Delhi draws criticism||The Ghaziabad municipal administration came under sharp criticism for appealing to residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) and local councillors to advise doctors and health care workers working in Delhi to stay there. At the center of the controversy is a letter dated April 20 from Ghaziabad chief medical officer (CMO) Dr. N K Gupta to municipal commissioner Dinesh Chandra who subsequently addressed the letter to all zonal in-charges on May 5. They said the appeal was in order to control infections that may arise with contact from Covid-19 positive cases in the Capital. Doctors, however, say that the wording of the appeal was not appropriate and at a time when there were attacks on health care workers across the country, their efforts must not be stigmatised. In light of those attacks, the central government had passed an ordinance that had heavy penalties against those who attacked front line workers and on Wednesday, the UP government followed it by toughening its laws against such attacks.“The appeal was made so that doctors and health care workers who work in Delhi do not get infection and also the other members of public and their families (in their highrises or nearby places) do not get infected. This was an appeal and in the form of a request, which is non binding upon doctors and health care workers who are staying in Ghaziabad but serving in nearby Delhi,” said Dr NK Gupta, CMO. “There are number of cases in which doctors and even patients have acquired infection. Even our government doctors and health care workers in Covid-19 and quarantine duties, about 100, are staying away from their families for over more than one month. We have made arrangements for them in hotels, hostels, etc.” Late on Thursday night, he issued another letter in which he specified that his original letter was an appeal and not binding. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not take calls when contacted.Municipal commissioner Dinesh Chandra said, “The communication is non-binding and in form of an appeal to the doctors and health care workers and issued in public interest.”Earlier, the Ghaziabad administration had imposed more restrictions at the Ghaziabad-Delhi border areas citing reason that there were at least six cases in which people got infected after travelling to Delhi.The members of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Ghaziabad held discussion with their members over the issue on Thursday and said that the doctors and health care workers were the front line soliders and infection comes as a professional hazard.“The doctors and health care persons are taking best possible precautions about the infection. We feel that the issue should have been taken up at the government to government level (UP government and Delhi government) to make arrangements for doctors and health care workers and should not have been publicised. It should have been for other people involved in providing essential services,” said Dr. V B Jindal, president of IMA, Ghaziabad.“We don’t want such a stigma which may be seen as discrimination. We feel that RWAs or the councillors should not be given such powers for restricting doctors or HCWs,” he added.Jindal added that that doctors and HCWs should take extra precautions like sanitisation of their vehicles they use and even while using services like the elevators in highrises.“We will also be holding discussions with Ghaziabad administration about the communication. If they are in the form of an appeal, the language should be more appropriate,” he added.Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of flat owners’ federation, said that all the districts in Delhi are in Red Zone and doctors and health care workers are prone to risk of getting infection.“We feel that the local administration in Ghaziabad or the Delhi government should make for decent arrangement for their stay if it is essentially required. In case any residential building has number of doctors or health care workers, they should take extra precautions and share some inconvenience in light of public interest. Once the situation improves, the original practice can be restored,” he added.Anil Sharma, the secretary of the federation of association of apartment owners said that the respective state governments should make arrangements for doctors and health care workers.“It seems that the local administration, rather than acting on their own, is trying to pass on the responsibility on to the RWAs to stop healthcare persons,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/appeal-by-gzb-officials-to-restrict-doctors-hcws-to-delhi-draws-criticism/story-uJLcmV2o426Mt493EMEBGM.html

The suspects had claimed to be doctors. The woman, who had recently given birth, was admitted to the hospital along with her newborn.The woman had said on Wednesday afternoon, a man wearing a protection kit approached her and asked her for her urine and milk samples for testing. The man was accompanied by another one and both claimed to be doctors.The arrested persons have been identified as Luvkush, of Bulandshahr, and Pravin Sundar of Meerut. Both the suspects were employees of an outsourcing company contracted by the hospital. The Knowledge Park police station had filed an FIR on a complaint given by Sharda hospital late Wednesday. The accused were booked under Section 354 (assault or criminal force on woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the Indian Penal Code.After the incident, the Sharda hospital has made isolation wards separate for women and men. A permanent staff has been deployed in the CCTV control room to keep a watch on people entering the Covid-19 section of the hospital. Authorities at Sharda hospital have also served notice to the outsourcing company which has been providing workers to them. All male hospital staff have been told to ensure the safety of women patients.“We have arrested the ward boy and the store person for molesting the patient. No such acts will be tolerated and strictest of the action will taken against such persons,” Rajesh Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, zone 3, said.The district magistrate has also asked the senior health officials to come up with strict guidelines for hospitals to ensure the safety of female patients. “I have asked the chief medical superintendent of the district hospital to prepare strict guidelines keeping in mind the safety of female patients to ensure that no incident like the Sharda one takes place again. There will be zero tolerance for such disgraceful acts. We will be issuing guidelines for hospitals soon ,” Suhas LY, district magistrate, GB Nagar, said.The 20-year-old woman had given birth to a girl at a Noida hospital on April 25 and doctors had taken her sample, as per protocol, for Covid-19 testing. On May 3, the woman tested positive for the infection and she was admitted to the Sharda hospital.

07-05-2020||Noida||Panic grips residential society after cancer patient and visiting nurse test Covid-19 positive||High drama was seen outside the Ajnara Daffodil society in Sector 137 on Thursday after the medical and paramedical staff of Felix hospital staged a protest against residents, in the wake of a breast cancer patient, a resident of the society, testing positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on May 4. Her husband, two children and six relatives have been put under institutional quarantine.Health officials said the woman is undergoing treatment for Covid-19 and cancer at a private hospital in Delhi. Her breast carcinoma, in its third stage, was detected on April 8 and she underwent one chemotherapy session in Delhi. But on April 27, her blood count dipped drastically and the woman’s husband called home a nurse from the Felix hospital to give her an injection.On Thursday, the 22-year-old nurse and her 20-year-old male colleague were among 10 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Gautam Budh Nagar. The total number of cases in the district has now reached 202.The husband of the cancer patient said there were high chances that his wife got the infection from the nurse. Also, on May 4, a 47-year-old man from Ghaziabad who was undergoing treatment at the Felix Hospital in Sector 137 had died of Covid-19.The husband tweeted on Thursday that a majority of the Felix hospital staff are infected which is leading to the spread of the infection. His tweet started a panic in the society. The Felix hospital staff and its chairman took umbrage to the claims made by the man and other residents. The doctors and paramedical then reached Ajnara Daffodil society and staged a protest against residents trying to defame the hospital.“The nurse who was visiting my wife was positive for Covid-19 as well as a colleague of hers. I suspect that my wife might have contracted the infection from her. I am currently in paid quarantine along with my two children, aged 6 and 12 years. Our samples have also been taken for testing. It is very upsetting that the Felix hospital, instead of taking responsibility for the spread of the disease, is blaming us and other residents,” the cancer patient’s husband said.The Felix hospital chairman said he will take legal action against residents who have claimed that his hospital staff are infected.“I am going to lodge an FIR against the husband of the cancer patient for trying to defame our hospital. We are providing our services in this crisis situation but even then, people are trying to malign our image. This man has been tweeting that 80% of our staff are Covid-19 positive, which is not true as only two of our staff members have tested positive till now. We are the front-line warriors in the fight against Covid-19 and if this is how we are treated, then we will not be able to provide our services. We held a protest outside the society against the allegations made by residents there,” Dr DK Gupta, chairman, Felix hospital, said.The society people are also worried because the husband of the woman had distributed food among the security guards and maintenance persons before his wife was found positive for the infection. All guards and maintenance persons have now been quarantined.“All our guards and maintenance persons have been quarantined as they had come in contact with the family. People are now panicking. The nurse who tested positive was also visiting our society. She was also attending to patients in nearby societies,” an Ajnara Daffodil resident, who did not want to be named, said.Some of the residents sought the district magistrate’s help on social media to take legal action against the hospital for staging a protest when prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC has been imposed in the district. No protest is allowed till the time the prohibitory orders are in place.“The protest by the Felix staff is in direct violation of the Section 144 and we will take strict legal action against the hospital,” Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, said.“We are already looking into the matter. Protests are not allowed when Section 144 is enforced in the district and police will take the required action,” Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.On Thursday, three male housekeeping staff from the Sharda Hospital tested positive for Covid-19. Three female patients -- a 4-year-old, a 5-year-old and 33-year-old from the Nat Madiya village in Greater Noida --were also positive for the infection. The three females are linked to a paramedical staff of the Government Institute of Medical Sciences who tested positive for Covid-19 earlier. A 17-year-old girl from sector 8 and a 55-year-old man from sector 15 were also found positive for the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/panic-grips-residential-society-after-cancer-patient-and-visiting-nurse-test-covid-19-positive/story-uc4QiqLbOVlREBnBfqUBlK.html

07-05-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana to give ₹7,000/acre to farmers for non-paddy crops||Much before the beginning of paddy transplantation season in mid June, Haryana government has started rolling out incentive- linked crop diversification plans to push farmers towards the cultivation of maize and pulses in place of rice.The rice cultivation has been losing traction as every year, groundwater table of Haryana depletes about one metre due to non-stop paddy sowing. Just 1kg rice production consumes 2,000-5,000 litre water, Haryana agriculture and farmers’ welfare department has said in its crop diversification scheme. While launching ‘Mera Pani Meri Virasat’ scheme on Wednesday, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced the state government will buy maize and pulses at the minimum support price (MSP).And, the farmers switching over to alternate crop in place of water guzzler paddy will get Rs 7,000 per acre incentive, he added. Government sources say to become eligible for Rs 7,000 per acre incentive, farmers will have to ensure crop diversification in minimum 50% land. They say the incentive could be given in two instalments — 25% after verification of the crop sown and 75% before harvesting. The first target is to implement the scheme in over exploited blocks of 12 districts by diversifying around 1 lakh hectare area.Haryana produces about 68 lakh MT of paddy, including over 25 MT basmati, across about 32 lakh acres. In one acre, about 30 quintal paddy (parmal) is produced and a farmer earns around Rs 30,000 per acre after excluding the input cost that is over Rs 20,000 per acre.Because of the assured marketing of the paddy under MSP, even non-rice producing areas have taken up paddy production on a large scale. “Maize used to be a major crop in the present rice belt of Haryana till 1970s,” an official said. Maize requires about four irrigation cycles, while rice requires 40-45, hence, the push for maize cultivation. 36 BLOCKS IN DARK ZONEGram panchayat Pentawas Kalan in Charkhi Dadri has passed a resolution not to sow paddy in their village.According to Khattar, 36 blocks of the state have become ‘dark zones’ where the groundwater depletion rate has doubled in 12 years. It means that where groundwater level was at 20 metres earlier, it has now gone down to 40 metres. In 19 of them, the water depth has exceeded 40 metres. However, out of these 19, paddy is not sown in 11 blocks.Eight paddy-rich blocks, including Ratia, Siwan, Guhla, Pipli, Shahabad, Babain, Ismailabad and Sirsa, where the depth of groundwater exceeds 40 metres, would be included in this scheme.The land under the panchayat having groundwater depth of more than 35 metres will not get permission to sow paddy. However, the incentive amount will be given to the panchayat only. Apart from these blocks, if the farmers of the remaining blocks also want to stop sowing paddy, they can apply for the incentive amount by giving information in advance. Khattar has urged the farmers to make up their minds to sow crops which require less water than paddy, such as maize, arhar, urad, guar, cotton, bajra, til and grishm moong and (Baisakhi moong) to ensure the availability of water for future generations. Box: Why state wants its farmers to switchThe land under paddy transplantation in Haryana is about 32 lakh acres. Just 1kg rice production consumes 2,000-5,000 litre water, which significantly affects the groundwater table.

Municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi said, “At present, we are fighting Covid-19 in the state capital. Our staff is engaged in that and we cannot pull them out to deliver bills to 5.57 lakh houses in the city. So, I have directed zonal officers to send bills through SMS, WhatsApp or e-mail.” However, the LMC has phone numbers and e-details of around 3.40 lakh house owners and it has yet to collect such details from around 2.17 lakh house owners. In this case, LMC men will visit such houses to collect e-details of owners, said an official of the LMC IT cell.The officials said that the decision to send online bills will also save a lot of money spent in paper, printer, and manpower.Residents of all the eight zones can dial their zonal office or LMC office in case they want to register their mobile numbers, and email ids with the LMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/check-your-e-mail-sms-for-house-tax-bill/story-5sSyUAPMP9Oxkkv1FJL9ZP.html

Hotspot Lokmanyanagar Sawarkarnagar alone recorded 35 positive cases, including that of a six-month-old baby, in the last 24 hours. One death was also reported in the city on Thursday.The total number of positive cases in the city is 560 with 21 deaths so far.The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) said that 35 cases are of those who attended the funeral of a Lokmanyanagar resident, who tested positive on April 13 after he died.The 72 people who had attended his funeral had been quarantined. Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner of TMC, said, “A 52-year-old man from Mumbra who was on dialysis died on Thursday. He went to Kalwa Hospital on May 4 for a dialysis when he was tested. He tested positive and died in his house in Mumbra.”Hanumant Jagdale, local corporator of Lokmanyanagar, said that most people from the funeral has tested negative. “The 35 cases are mostly from Kajuvadi, Vijaynagar, Ramchandranagar and Sambhaji Nagar which are part of Sawarkarnagar and not Lokmanyanagar. For over one and half months, there is no assistant municipal commissioner in this ward. It is essential to form a special ward-level committee of experts to prevent the spread of virus in this ward.”TMC also issued a circular about following safety protocol in hospitals for all deaths. Two bodies were released from Chhatrapati Shivaji Hospital in Kalwa, Thane, without following any safety protocol, and both tested positive after death. Taking disciplinary action, TMC replaced the dean of the hospital. The circular by civic commissioner Vijay Singhal states, “It has come to my notice that a few days ago, Kalwa hospital handed over a man’s body to his relatives without following any safety protocol. This has put the relatives, friends and family of the deceased at risk of infection as the person tested positive later. It will now be mandatory to follow all safety protocol in case of any death in hospitals as. The body will be taken straight to funeral homes while it will be packed in a body bag. This will ensure that the people attending the funeral are not infected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-sees-spurt-in-covid-cases-tally-touches-560/story-0VlBgdhMXZ5VBbbGlugyMP.html
07-05-2020||City||Desilting of Buddha Nullah delayed in Ludhiana||With monsoon only a couple of months away, the Ludhiana municipal corporation has yet to start desilting of Buddha Nullah. Desilting of the nullah is conducted every year, usually beginning April, to avoid flooding during the monsoon.When not desilted, nullah is unable to contain the water, which overflows at different points and enters houses of residents living in the stream’s periphery. Residents of New Kundanpuri and Upkar Nagar are affected almost every year, with clogging of internal drains. DRAINAGE DEPARTMENT NOT PAIDThe civic body assigns the desilting work to the drainage department, as it lacks dragline excavators, a machine required for the process. An MC official, requesting anonymity, said the drainage department had asked MC to submit ₹80 lakh to begin the desilting exercise. “The payment has yet to be made. MC had allocated ₹2 crore for desilting of Buddha Nullah in the 2019-20 budget,” he said.However, MC commissioner Kanwalpreet Kaur Brar said, “The civic body had planned to purchase the necessary machinery to carry out desilting itself, but the process got delayed due to the lockdown. The drainage department submitted the estimate to do the job on Thursday. The payment will be made soon.”Ratan Singh, a resident of New Kundanpuri, said the nullah overflowed almost every year in the monsoon, pushing dirty water into multiple houses. Despite repeated requests to the MC, it delays desilting work every year, he claimed.“The factories along the nullah were closed when the lockdown was announced on March 24. The waste from these factories is not being discharged into the drain and the water level has also reduced. MC should make most of this situation and start the desilting exercise at the earliest. It also needs to strengthen the banks of the nullah before the rainy season to avoid flooding,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/desilting-of-buddha-nullah-delayed-in-ludhiana/story-0PinBsnAveftuBlq4g8OtL.html

The move has created an uproar among government teachers, with the association of teachers attached with the DoE on Thursday demanding an immediate withdrawal of the notice.According to the notice dated May 5, the teacher allegedly posted various “politically motivated” articles, clips and comments on social media platforms against the Delhi government’s initiatives such as Mohalla Clinic, Mission Buniyad, free ration distribution (amid the national lockdown), relaxation in lockdown norms and opening of liquor shops. “Criticism of politics of the government on public platforms and passing derogatory remarks is unbecoming of a government servant,” the notice read.The teacher has been asked to furnish an explanation to the department within five days.Terming it a way to “oppress” teachers, the government schools teachers’ association on Thursday wrote to the principal secretary of the DoE, saying, “This show cause notice is nothing but a decisively planned step of concerned officials to oppress, incite fear and insult the teaching community. The show cause notice must be immediately repealed.”Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the association, said the notice will set a wrong example. “Teachers should be judged on the basis of their work and not their social media posts. We will oppose this move.”Officials in the DoE said the notice was issued after necessary deliberation. “No one should create panic among the people by unnecessarily criticising the government in times like these. We have sought a response from the teacher on it,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-school-teacher-issued-notice-over-politically-motivated-social-media-post/story-4Sd2V0Ps7KnYBw5XS3A2ZP.html

07-05-2020||Delhi||Woman kills husband, tries to pass death off as due to Covid; arrested||A 35-year-old woman allegedly killed her husband with the help of her friend in northwest Delhi’s Ashok Vihar on May 1. She then reportedly tried to pass the death off as having been caused by Covid-19, police said. However, no medical records, the suspicion of neighbours and the final autopsy report of the man nailed the woman and her accomplice, who confessed to the murder on Monday and were arrested, senior police officials said. Police identified the victim as Sharat Das, a 45-year-old shopkeeper, who was married to Anita Das, 35. The couple hail from Odisha and has two children, who live with Anita’s relatives in Noida. The woman’s friend, who allegedly helped her kill Sharat, was identified as Sanjay, 32, police said.According to the police, the incident came to light when one of the neighbours called up the control room on May 2 and reported about a man’s suspicious death. The caller said that while interacting with the deceased’s wife, they found that something was suspicious because the woman had mentioned to them that her husband possibly died of Covid-19, but none of them had seen the man unwell or visiting any hospital. On this, a police team reached the couple’s house to enquire about the death, officials said.Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya said during preliminary enquiry, the woman was asked to present her husband’s medical history related to Covid-19 or any other disease that may have caused his death, but she couldn’t. When cross-questioned, she claimed that she had found her husband dead in the morning but couldn’t give any satisfactory reasons as to how or why. When we asked if her man had particularly shown symptoms of Covid, she answered in the negative, the DCP said.“On this, the man’s body was removed from the house and was taken to Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial Hospital for a post-mortem. The woman and her two children were asked to stay indoors until the autopsy reports were out,” Arya said.The DCP said, on May 4, the autopsy report of the man came and the cause of death was revealed as “asphyxia, ante mortem smothering”.“On this, we registered a case of murder and Anita was detained from her house. When she was interrogated thoroughly, she kept repeating that she wasn’t aware how her husband died. However, when she was confronted with facts, like why did she not take him to a hospital or why wasn’t he under any medication, she broke down and confessed that she had killed him,” Arya said.The DCP said, Anita told police that she is in an extramarital relationship with one Sanjay, who also lives in the same locality. “She said, some months ago, Sharat came to know about her extramarital relationship and they often used to fight over it. She said she told Sanjay to get rid of Sharat and they planned to eliminate him during the pandemic to avoid suspicion. On the night of May 1, when Sharat was asleep Anita called Sanjay and they smothered the man using a blanket,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/woman-kills-husband-tries-to-pass-death-off-as-due-to-covid-arrested/story-qD10PBkUhICmbsvDU3dUQN.html

However, the adjoining Sector 26E has found itself in the midst of problems, with area residents complaining that they have been unable to get essentials supplies for many days now as all supplies are being diverted towards the colony.Highlighting this, general secretary of the residential welfare society (RWS) of the EWS houses here, Sanjeev Shukla ,said, “There have been no positive case in our neighbourhood, yet it has also been sealed. We have no markets within our sector and we only depend on the buses of essential supplies that the administration sends us. Right now the colony is their priority, so all buses are sent there and we have to make do with leftovers. Many times, we don’t get any supplies at all. It is very frustrating for us to see buses full of fresh vegetables going towards the colony every day, and yet we can’t purchase any.”Vice-president of the RWS, Mukesh Chaudhary, added that the administration needs to provide a separate passage for residents of Sector 26-E as currently all their entry and exit points are through the colony. “We just want amenities. If the authorities can’t provide them to us, then they should at least let us go to a market nearby and purchase essentials for ourselves,” he said. The RWS through Federation of Sector Welfare Association Chandigarh (FOSWAC) had submitted a representation to deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar, but they alleged that the situation didn’t improve at all. FOSWAC chairman Baljinder Singh Bittu said, “The residents are ready to stay inside their houses for the best interests of the city, but they need food to eat. The ATM service here has also not been regular, and the administration needs to make sure that they are provided with essentials daily.”Claiming to have not received any such complaint, local area councillor, Dalip Singh, who also lives in the colony, said, “Our focus right now is to keep the morale of the colony high, so most supplies have been heading there first. I will ensure that buses with supplies are also sent to the adjoining locality of Sector 26E.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/adjoining-hotspot-bapu-dham-residents-of-sec-26e-decry-shortage-of-supplies/story-UnIIzhAYV8T38ASO5I7isJ.html

However, now, every six hours or so, we have to be with Covid-19 patients in the intensive care unit, checking vitals, assisting the doctors with the examinations and procedures, sweating all the while as the central air conditioning system remains switched off to prevent the infection from spreading,” she says.Most of the health workers at the Covid-19 centre have to wear PPEs for seven to eight hours straight. Donning and doffing the protective suit also takes time.“For a few minutes you lose sensation after you take off the PPE. Your feet swell up, you feel dehydrated. The protective eyewear causes blisters and marks on the forehead,” Sandhu adds.Face shields fog up, says Monu Mariya Jose, a 26-year-old nursing officer. “After 10 to 15 minutes you cannot see anything. And you don’t have the liberty of cleaning it as it is fixed and you cannot use your hands to touch your face.”Many healthcare workers wear adult diapers as the PPE kits cannot be removed during duty hours, and controlling bladder pressure can be difficult, Jose adds.However, even as the youth brigade enthusiastically goes about its duties, seniors keep a close eye on them to make sure they are following the guidelines and protocols.Shinder Pal Kaur Lidhar, a senior nursing officer at the Covid-19 hospital, says “We keep checking whether the PPEs have been worn properly, negating any chance of infection. We too are at the risk, but seeing the young people at the forefront gives you a shot of energy,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/young-covid-19-warriors-in-chandigarh-undaunted-by-infection-risks-skin-lesions-dehydration/story-eqhDgUhED3lreabkgjbiPI.html

We have to go from YPS Chowk side which connects with Mohali, where policemen stop us saying we cannot use the road without a movement pass. The administration’s step-motherly treatment towards southern sectors is unwarranted.” He also said he had written to UT adviser Manoj Parida asking him to resolve this issue.A resident of Sector 61, Colonel (retd) Jaspal Anand said the administration had turned a blind eye towards the southern sectors. “We had asked for the liquor vend here to be closed as this is a small sector and unruly people gather here. But the vendor’s licence was again renewed recently. Officials are not ready to listen to us.”Residents of Sector 55 are also facing the same issue. An employee of Punjab National Bank who lives in Chandigarh housing board society here, on the condition of anonymity, said that bank employees living there had been facing trouble from Monday onward. “There are two entrances to the complex. The Chandigarh side was blocked while the other entrance opens towards Mohali, which didn’t allow us to go to Chandigarh. After we wrote to the UT adviser the barricades were removed and we finally went to office on Thursday,” the resident said.Police officials said that all vehicles coming from the Mohali side passing through the roads from here are being checked, but those with residence proof were allowed to pass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/heckled-by-police-residents-of-southern-chandigarh-sectors-cry-foul-over-movement-curbs/story-1wtiMZ4Bobh7oGHv1n2aiP.html

The total number of cases is 253.Two days ago, 18 new cases had marked the highest 24-hour spike in KDMC.“Among the new cases is a two-month-old girl,” said an official from KDMC health department.KDMC health department said out of the 20 new cases, 10 travel to Mumbai for work every day.Out of the 253 cases, 87 are those working for essential services such as the police, healthcare and bank and travel to Mumbai daily.Three police personnel, one civic employee, a health department staffer and an employee of a civic hospital are among Thursday’s cases.A 32-year-food delivery boy, who works in Mumbai and lives in Kalyan (East), has also tested positive. “He has not been going to work for more than two weeks as he self-quarantined himself after his housing society members objected his travel to Mumbai every day.

He, however, stated that medico-legal procedures take time.“Some videos are circulated and attempts are made to politicise them. When a person dies, he or she, as per the protocol, is wrapped in black plastic to prevent chance of infection. This takes time. Their relatives are also apprehensive; they, at times, take time to reach the hospital,” he said.Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis condemned the “inhuman treatment”. “Sion hospital incident is extremely serious and (sic) shocking. Patients, who are being treated are lying besides dead bodies. This is utterly inhuman. Is there no one to take care of Mumbai ? The government must immediately look into this and ensure this doesn’t happen again,’’ he tweeted .BJP leader Ashish Shelar tweeted: “Has the BMC and state government lost all its sensitivity ? Is this the pattern that you will take to the world? CM, guardian minister seem to be making a mockery of poor patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tope-no-need-to-politicise-issue/story-ebCPLK3tIOKqNtPDQ3LBHI.html
07-05-2020||City||To pedal home, 18 migrants in Mohali sell phones to buy cycles||Desperate to reach home, a group of 18 migrants, all construction labourers living in Sohana, sold their cellphones to buy bicycles in order to pedal home to Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh.Their stories were similar, about misery, hunger, poverty and being ditched by the employers in time of need.Ram Niwas, a migrant part of the group of 18, said, “Left with little money and ration, we decided to go back home. No one is stopping people on cycles, so we all sold our cellphones and bought cycles. Once we reach home we can buy new phones.”For last two years, these migrants had been working at a construction site in Sohana, but were rendered jobless when Punjab imposed the curfew to check spread of the epidemic.“The last 40 days have been a nightmare,” said Mangal, with the group from Sohana village. Riding cycles that cost them ₹4,200 each, they began the journey back home on Wednesday night.Apart from their belongings, their backpacks contain ration and a small cylinder, enough to last them over the 359 kms they will be covering.Although the rising temperature is a cause of worry, they have a plan to beat the heat. “We will cycle mostly at night and take a break when the Sun is at its peak,” said Vicky, who has memorised the names of all important towns they will be crossing on their way, to ensure they do not get lost. He has drawn a rough map of the route back home with the help of the internet.Determined not to return, Ghanshyam said, “There are many factories in UP, too, so we will get jobs. We had come to Mohali for work, but in the last few days it dawned on us that family is far more important.” Ram Niwas added that when the curfew was imposed, their contractor disowned them. “He stopped taking our calls. We survived only because we had each other. We shared whatever little resources we had among the group,” said Niwas.Asked why they did not choose to register online for the Shramik special trains ferrying migrants who wished to go back home, the group said that not everyone who is getting registered is allowed to go back. “We did not want that any of us be left behind. We have been together in this difficult time and together we will reach home safe,” came the reply in a chorus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/to-pedal-home-18-migrants-in-mohali-sell-phones-to-buy-cycles/story-nP4gniTyY2wAMQNH8XoAgL.html
07-05-2020||City||Coronavirus lockdown: With migrants returning home, Ludhiana schools fear dwindling class strength||With lakhs of migrant labourers choosing to return to their home states from Ludhiana, schools located in the district have another reason to worry amid the coronavirus lockdown — the decreasing class strength.Principals of various government and private institutions are receiving calls from parents for school leaving certificates.Over 5 lakh migrants working in Ludhiana have registered on the Punjab helpline portal to return home.As per sources, majority of students at the government and private schools in Giaspura, Dhandari Kalan, Dhandari Khurd, Sherpur Kalan, Lohara, Shimlapuri, Jamalpur and Mundian Kalan belong to migrant families. Headmaster of Government High School, Sherpur Kalan, Lakhvir Singh said, “Of the 1,010 students in Classes 6-10, 90% come from migrant families hailing from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. I am receiving many calls from students informing that they are going back to their home towns. This is worrying, as it will bring down our enrolment.”“Most of the 1,056 students in Classes 6-12 at our schools are from other states. So far, 12 students from Bihar have informed me about their return and they are not sure when they will come back to Ludhiana,” said Ujjalvir Singh, principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Dhandari Khurd.Satish Kumar, who works at a factory, said he and his family will be travelling to Uttar Pradesh on Friday. “Due to depleting finances, we have decided to return home. My family will die of hunger here. My children study in Government School, Sherpur Kalan, and I have informed their teachers about them leaving,” he said.Durga Rani, a domestic help who hails from Gaya in Bihar, said they were a family of six. “Earlier, my three children got mid-day meal from school, but it stopped with closure of schools. Now, I have no money to buy ration and prepare meals for my family, so we have decided to return to Bihar,” she said.Head teacher of Government Primary School, Giaspura, Nisha Rani, said, “We have a strength of 2,675 students. As of now, no parent has informed me of their ward leaving. We will get clarity once the school reopens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-lockdown-with-migrants-returning-home-ludhiana-schools-fear-dwindling-class-strength/story-sNzlI8ecK7R0FBZOp9FLvI.html
07-05-2020||City||UP migrants board train home for ‘3 regular meals’||For 1,288 migrants, it was a route to freedom from hunger and helplessness, on Thursday, as the first special train ferrying migrant workers of Uttar Pradesh chugged off from Mohali railway station.The workers who left for home in Hardoi, UP, were relieved their torment in the city had ended. They said they were living in wretched conditions, with no food, little water and empty pockets, as their employers had stopped paying them salaries. Saying they were unlikely to return soon, as they would at least get “three daily meals at home”.The 24-coach non-stop train ferrying these 1288 migrants home left Mohali railway station at 10 am and will have no intermittent stoppage before Hardoi.There are around 6,000 migrant workers from Hardoi, who are working in Mohali.On of the migrants Mohammad Tayyab, 32, said that over one month, they struggled to get three meals a day. “Our employer did not give us any money, so we had to borrow which has left us in debt.” When asked about what work would they do when they get back home, he said he didn’t know but would atleast eat three times a day. About returning, he said, “It will take at least three months for me return back.”Another migrant worker said they were ‘living in hell’ for the past 40 days. “we were finding it really difficult to make both ends meet. We thought that if we didn’t die of the virus, we would surely die of hunger. Our employer gave us no money so we borrowed from here and there,” said Naresh Kumar, 30.A domestic worker from Hardoi, Seema, 32, said, “At least we have house in UP. For two months we sat idle without work. Whatever we ate came from NGO’s and other organisations. Now, I don’t feel like coming back.”Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan, who was also present at the railway station, said that the workers had been thoroughly screened at the designated collection centres before they boarded the train. However, only 65% of those who had registered on the government portal turned up for departure.“It is a good omen,” said the DC, adding, “People deciding to stay on is an indication that we are tip-toeing towards normalcy. Permission to resume labour intensive construction work and industrial operations has provided an opportunity to earn money and will check mass exodus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-migrants-board-train-home-for-3-regular-meals/story-5E6OdXqVxukFcslQvwcNfI.html
07-05-2020||Chandigarh||Experts foresee acute labour shortage in post-lockdown Chandigarh||As more migrant workers in the city are queuing up to move back to their home states, the local industry and businesses foresee acute labour shortages in the coming months.With only partial reopening of private offices and industry in the city, the demand for workers is low for now, but severe shortages can be expected of semi-skilled and unskilled workers when businesses finally pick up, say experts.After the UT administration revoked the 41-day curfew on May 4, the shops were allowed to open based on the odd-even formula. A maximum of 33% staff was allowed to resume work in private sector offices. Industrial activity, too, resumed operations as per the guidelines of the Union home ministry on May 1.SO FAR, SO GOODCharanjiv Singh, chairman of the Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, said, “Only 30% of total shops in the city are open on any given day. The buyer footfall is still relatively low and there are concerns about personal safety. Consequently, the demand for migrant workforce is low for now.”In the city’s industrial areas, too, manufacturing activity is yet to pick up, but labour issues have already started to crop up. “Around 25% of the labour is turning up in factories. And 30% of the total workforce is headed home. Another 20% who used to come from Panchkula and Mohali districts are stuck in containment zones,” said Siddharth Gupta of the Industrial Association of Chandigarh.After remaining shut for 45 days, industrial units are opening up with stock-taking, maintenance activity, cleaning and sanitisation, rather than manufacturing. Many segments, like screw manufacturing where adhering strictly to social distancing norms is difficult owing to the nature of the machinery operation and setup, are yet to open.MAJOR CRUNCH PREDICTED“Ancillary units with large manufacturing orders with strict deadlines and export-oriented industries have most to lose in the coming days as the pressure to deliver products will step up,” said Harjit Singh, general secretary of the Furniture Market, Chandigarh.As for the smaller units, while labour crunch will not be a major problem, a paucity of skilled craftsmen will be. “In the furniture manufacturing units, work orders can be managed with a small workforce. Overtime or work on holidays can be opted for. But a lack of skilled workers like polishers or designers is posing a problem already. With no work coming in, many of them left early. If the business activity does not pick up quickly, most will leave in the coming days and months,” added Singh.In addition to fears of reverse migration among labour, businesses are also complaining of labour shortages because of cross-border restrictions within the tricity. “Nearly 30% of the workers in the city reside in cheaper locations like Zirakpur, Naygaon in Mohali and Panchkula villages. Because of the restrictions, the labour movement has been severely impeded. If not sorted soon, it will cause major problems for the industry,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/experts-foresee-acute-labour-shortage-in-post-lockdown-chandigarh/story-itwMQqlPlBT1UwWOYNarVM.html

The same was discussed with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and the examination dates for higher and technical education will be declared on Friday at 1pm,” said a statement by Samant.Last month, Uday Samant conducted virtual interactions with heads of all state universities as well as the directors of DTE and CET Cell along with the state principal secretary, urging all to come up with constructive steps to conduct exams for the current academic year as well as structure the 2020-21 academic year. An expert committee was formed in order to file a report on the same.“Before any plans are drawn or executed, the state government first needs to temporarily tweak statutes of the Maharashtra State Public Universities Act, 2015, so that the changes are applicable to the entire 2020-21 batch and are discontinued thereafter. State government needs to pass a temporary ordinance in this matter,” said T A Shiware, chairman of the Mumbai Association of Non Government Colleges. According to the association, state higher education institutes can not start their next academic year before September-October 2020. “If the lockdown is lifted by May-end, colleges still have the month of June to conduct exams and announce results in the same month while the university can conduct final year exams in July and ensure results are out by August. Online exams will not be feasible for several students studying in the rural parts of the state,” highlights a letter sent by the association to the heads of state education department as well as minister of state.In case the current lockdown situation is extended till June 30, the association suggests that all students be promoted based on their performance in the previous semester. “Several state governments are preparing plans but we suggest that Maharashtra take into consideration the decision of the University Grants Commission (UGC) before taking a final call,” added Shiware.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/final-decision-on-maharashtra-university-exams-to-be-announced-on-friday-minister-uday-samant/story-Id0ZUpr53tc4jtLluI83BK.html

Amit Sharma, assistant professor of livestock production and management, said farmers should keep a check on the entry of wild pigs in their farms. “The main entrances of farms must remain closed at all times. All boundary walls must be constructed high enough so that stray animals may not climb inside the farms. Pigsties must be thoroughly cleaned daily with a disinfectant or hot water. Utensils which are used to serve food to sick pigs should not be used to serve food to healthy pigs,” Sharma said.He added, “Use ectoparasiticides to control ticks in pigs. Deworming of the animals must be done. Quarantine the newly-purchased animals for 20 days before their introduction in the herd.”Dr Vishal Mahajan of Animal Disease Research Centre said vaccination of all animals must be conducted for Swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).“No kitchen waste should be fed to the pigs. Workers at farms must also take precautions against Covid-19, which include maintaining social distancing, wearing masks and washing hands regularly,” Mahajan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/african-swine-fever-in-assam-gadvasu-cautions-pig-farmers-in-punjab/story-HVXOleqB52RYeKR8WI2f4N.html

They later released me and asked me to head straight to my house,” Singh said.“Never before was Jammu and its youth treated so shabbily by any previous dispensation in the erstwhile state of J&K. While there are no takers for the concerns of the educated youth of the Jammu region, the common man, the civil society, and the employees class too were bearing the brunt of the highly apathetic approach of the UT administration at the behest of their New Delhi masters. The unemployed, underemployed, the contractual and other temporary class of employees of the Jammu region were the worst affected section with no attention whatsoever being paid by the present regime to address their bonafide concerns. The health employees of the Jammu region appointed under SRO-24 had been arbitrarily terminated while allowing their Kashmir counterparts to continue in service,” he said.He said that repressive measures adopted by the BJP government won’t stifle his voice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-national-panthers-party-chairman-put-under-house-arrest-later-released/story-EYHtmGF3ePYT2Xp84CdEDP.html

Petrol is now available at ₹69.99 per litre, while diesel will be sold at ₹62.56 per litre.Amandeep Singh, a city-based advocate, though welcomed the decision by Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan to increase the excise duty on liquor, condemned the Punjab government for increasing the fuel prices.“Liquor is not a necessity, but people need fuel to commute to work or even buy groceries. The tax on liquor is justified, but hike in fuel prices will hurt the common man,” said Amandeep.Davinder Singh, a counsellor at Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Centre of Ludhiana civil hospital, said the hike in fuel prices will burden providers of essential services the most.“If the government has increased the fuel prices, it should also provide proper facilities to health workers and other government staff, who are risking their lives daily. Many health workers are still working without safety gear, while the contractual staff are not even covered under the government insurance,” Davinder said.Gurjit Singh, a Model Town-based grocer, criticised the government for burdening the middle class.“The lockdown has not stopped electricity bills, monthly rent, school fees, EMIs or phone bills for us. People are still somehow managing it when all the economic operations are shut. Though the government had announced some relaxations for the economically weaker section (EWS), the middle class are on their own. Such hike will only make our lives miserable,” Singh said.DISASTROUS MOVE, SAYS INDUSTRIALISTS Gurmeet Singh Kular, president of the Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO), said the hike in fuel prices will only make it difficult for the industry to get back on track.“Although the industries here are gradually restarting their operations, some decisions made by the government will definitely make their revival difficult. The fuel hike will have damaging consequences for the industries, which are already struggling due to shortage of labourers who are being sent back home. We condemn both the decisions of the government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hike-in-fuel-prices-unjust-burden-on-common-man-say-ludhiana-residents/story-IvNtMSZriKSVYK2p8BXTlI.html

Due to this strategy we have been able to trace positive cases that were asymptomatic. These people would have infected many if not been traced. We are tracing every single contact of positive cases,” he added.A health department official claimed that some protocols implemented by J&K to trace contacts and test them are stricter than other states.The administration has set up 11 exclusive Covid hospitals—eight in Srinagar and three in Jammu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/at-72-j-k-s-covid-recovery-rate-better-than-national-average/story-uJ1LzPxbPtTX73qiyGBU7L.html

The 36-year-old resident doctor was one of the high-risk contacts of the infected doctor, whose two daughters have also tested positive. The resident doctors have again demanded to get tested. They said some of them are not quarantined and made to work in the hospital. A resident doctor requesting anonymity said, “There are nine resident doctors, out of which, two have been tested. Out of the remaining seven, five are showing symptoms and should be quarantined and tested.”Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner of Thane Municipal Corporation, said, “We had tested senior doctor’s close contacts. One resident doctor has tested positive.”The newly appointed dean of the hospital, Pratibha Sawant, said the high-risk contacts have been quarantined and the stress is now on using proper safety kit. “There was some negligence in using a proper safety kit while doing rounds of the wards. I have made it compulsory that all the required kit should be used. We have tested some doctors and the others will soon be tested.”The hospital has 1,200 personal protection equipment (PPE) kits, which the administration claims is sufficient. Two doctors and one nurse from the hospital have tested positive.Woman tests positive after death After inviting flak for handing over two bodies of suspected Covid patients without following any safety protocol, Kalwa hospital was careful after a 45-year-old woman died on May 5. Her Covid test report had not come, but the hospital authorities followed protocol while handing over the body.RT Kendre, officer on special duty for Covid-19, said, “The woman from Varli pada of Srinagar was admitted to Kalwa hospital for chest pain. She was admitted to ICU and later shifted to the general ward. When she showed symptoms of the virus, she was shifted to the isolation ward. Her swab was taken. She died on May 5 before the report was out.”The next day, she tested positive. “We took all precautions while handing over the body to relatives,” said Kendre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kalwa-hospital-resident-doctor-tests-positive-staff-yet-to-be-isolated/story-IbLLVwby46We94A7XiwhMM.html

The state government should have made enough arrangements for testing these people and should have set up quarantine centres at a local level with all basic requirements so that infected individuals could have been identified immediately.But due to their negligence, five new Covid-19 positive cases and one fatality has been reported in the last two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cpi-m-demands-action-against-shimla-admn-for-violating-rules-on-covid/story-IQsCYLnNMJZMVkN0KOSVxN.html

07-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi High Court orders govt to set up complaint boxes at all ration stores||The Delhi High Court has directed the city government to put up complaint boxes at every Public Distribution System (PDS) and non-PDS distribution centres, within three days on Wednesday. The court’s order came while hearing a plea which had contended that people in the city are not availing the free ration services of the government.A bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Talwant Singh also asked the government to file a compliance report on the steps taken by the government to ensure that all the poor and needy are provided ration.The court’s order comes while hearing a plea by an NGO Delhi Rozi Roti Abhiyan Adhikaar, which had contended that many people are still not getting rations. The plea had also pointed out that the government has introduced e-coupons for people did not have a ration card. However, obtaining an e-coupon would require a person to have a smartphone, and knowing know how to fill in details and upload photographs.On Wednesday, during the video conference hearing, the court was informed by senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, who represented the petitioners, that many ration shops were closed during working hours. Around 38% of the shops, which volunteers of the NGO visited between April 29 and 30, were found to be closed. The counsel also submitted that the system of issuing e-coupons to those who do not have ration cards was inaccessible to the most vulnerable as it required a smartphone, ability to use the internet, generate OTP, upload photos of the family and a copy of the Aadhaar card and finally to download the e-coupon. It (the NGO) suggested that facilitation desks should be set up at all schools and ration shops to give coupons to people who need foodgrains but do not have ration cards and are unable to apply for e-coupons. They also said that the complaint number was inaccessible.Appearing for the Delhi government, additional standing counsel, Anuj Aggarwal, sought some time from the court to file a detailed compliance affidavit, following which the court granted him four days to file the reply.The bench also directed that complaint boxes be installed at the PDS shops so that people do not face any problem and posted the matter to May 11 for further hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-orders-govt-to-set-up-complaint-boxes-at-all-ration-stores/story-azTtXtH2KEPk8ynOeJcx0J.html

He talked to the media in Palghar after visiting the site of the incident as well Kasa police station. Rumours about thieves in disguise roaming around Palghar to kidnap victims for organ smuggling led to the panic among tribals, which in turn resulted in the lynching incident.Deshmukh said the home department has received a report about the rumours from local police and is gathering further information from local MP, MLA, Zilla Parishad members. The state CID has taken over the probe. The minister said they have received applications seeking release of those innocent who have been arrested and added that the process of releasing the innocent from among the arrested will only take place after the CID completes its inquiry. “We will later inquire as to how the three victims managed to hoodwink the police and travel 120 km from Mumbai to reach the spot, and the guilty will be punished,” said Deshmukh.Earlier, five police personnel, including Kasa police in-charge API Anandrao Kale, PSI Sudhir Katare and three others were suspended while 35 police personnel (the entire Kasa police staff) were transferred to other police stations in Palghar police district. So far 115 accused have been arrested and have since been remanded in police custody till May 14 by the Dahanu court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/palghar-lynching-case-home-min-confirms-cops-were-aware-of-rumours/story-tSwCYH93OurLqj6xLQYdkJ.html

07-05-2020||Mumbai||Environment ministry’s CRZ amendment ends debate on inland mangrove protection in Mumbai Metropolitan Region||The Union environment ministry’s latest amendment to the coastal regulation zone (CRZ) norms ends speculations by planning agencies in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) that claimed artificially created “inland mangroves” need not be protected.The notification dated May 1 was published by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) on its website on Wednesday amending the CRZ 2011 norms stating mangrove forests developed towards the landward side due to saltwater flow from sluice gates or bunds, mainly identified as inland mangroves, need to be protected under the coastal protection notification.“Provided that in case there exists a bund or a sluice gate constructed in the past, prior to February 19, 1991, the high tide line (HTL) shall be restricted up to the line along the bund or sluice gate and in such a case, area under mangroves arising due to saline water ingress beyond the bund or sluice gate shall be classified as CRZ-IA irrespective of the extent of the area beyond the bund or sluice gate. Such areas under mangroves shall be protected and shall not be diverted for any developmental activities,” the notification said.The notification could protect mangrove forests in Uran and Dronagiri where the Navi Mumbai Special Economic Zone — an integrated industrial township — has been planned. A Bombay high court (HC) order from September 2018 had made it clear that mangroves anywhere in Maharashtra cannot be destroyed and the notification reiterates the declaration.In 2015, the City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. (Cidco), the planning agency for Navi Mumbai, had claimed that mangroves that had grown in holding ponds (for high tide water connected to sluice gates mainly at Panje, Karanje and Koparkhairne) were not protected under the CRZ notification since they were “inland mangroves”. Cidco had filed an application in the HC in the public interest litigation (87 of 2006) originally filed by environmentalist Debi Goenka where the claim was made. “This notification, once and for all, settles the issue that all mangroves are protected under the CRZ notification and that all embankments and sluice gates built without valid permissions after February 19, 1991, are illegal,” said Goenka. “Hopefully, the Panje wetlands and all the other mangroves in Navi Mumbai will have to be protected by Cidco.”Pramod Patil, nodal officer (environment), Cidco said, “The sluice gates in Uran were constructed sometime during 1994-95. The case was made at the time in 2015-16 due to rapid mangrove growth that was happening post-construction of the bunds and gates, which was causing inconvenience during monitoring of the holding ponds under our jurisdiction. However, following the HC order from September 2018, mangroves, irrespective of their location, are provided the highest protection status within our jurisdiction.”Goenka alleged that since the construction of the gates happened post the CRZ 1991 notification, they had been illegally built. “While the sluice gates had not been properly maintained (by Cidco themselves), the planning agency made several efforts to destroy mangrove trees within Navi Mumbai and Uran. Pursuant to the notice of motion, the HC in 2016 had directed the MoEF to give us a hearing and had asked the MoEF to decide on this issue. However, despite the hearing held February 29, 2016, no formal order was passed by the ministry then,” he said.Meanwhile, the state mangrove cell welcomed MoEFCC’s amendment. “It is a good development and gives legal protection to especially those areas where safety measures were proposed to be reduced due to the claim that they were inland mangroves,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove cell).Why the amendment?MoEFCC’s amended comes after the Goa government made a request to demarcate the HTL (the extent to which coastal waters can reach the farthest on land) along embankments even if they were breached. Independent experts said the consequences of the amendment need to be studied for all other coastal zones to check the impact it would have on constructions planned in the future across CRZ areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/environment-ministry-s-crz-amendment-ends-debate-on-inland-mangrove-protection-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region/story-zVWhyRWH3TYXGF06rtzZ9I.html

However, the lockdown from March 24 ruined our holiday and we have been stranded here since then, not knowing what to do, says Swarup Ranjan Saha, a member of the group who works in the railways. Living in the hotel where they have hired 10 rooms, the tourists earlier paid Rs 600 per room, which has now been reduced to Rs 200 by their hotel. “Since there are 12 children in the group, we’re having a hard time getting meals from them,” Saha adds.The tourists hope the Punjab government, which has started sending back groups of migrants back to their towns and villages, will help them too.For food, they say they are dependent on langars (community meals) at Durgiana and Golden temples. “We are still paying the hotel and buying essential items. All of us, including the children, are healthy and fit and do not suffer from any Covid-19 symptoms,” says Sabyasachi Ghosh, another group member. No one, however, has been screened for the virus, he adds.Registered with adminThe group has reached out to the police and district administration and has been guided by them to get registered with the administration as stranded people who want to return home. “Nothing has been done so far. Since the government is making efforts to send migrant labourers home, they should also make arrangements to send us back to West Bengal,” demands Ghosh.In what could give them hope, additional deputy commissioner (ADC) Himanshu Aggarwal says, “Since the Punjab government has scheduled trains to ferry stranded people in various states, we have also sent a proposal to start a train from Punjab to Howrah district in West Bengal.

07-05-2020||Mumbai||PG med admissions: HC reprieve for in-service candidates||In a relief for candidates seeking admission to post-graduate (PG) medical courses through the in-service quota, the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday clarified that there was no cap on the number of years of completed service in tribal, difficult or rural areas for which they could get additional marks for admission.Justice SC Gupte was hearing a petition filed by Dr Abinav Bhute, challenging a government resolution (GR) issued by the Maharashtra medical education department on March 19 last year, granting only 4℅ additional weightage to in-service candidates who rendered service in rural areas, instead of the 10℅ weightage given by the Medical Council of India (MCI).In the petition, advocate Madhav Thorat pointed out that Maharashtra government has reserved 25℅ of the PG diploma and 25℅ of PG degree seats for in-service candidates. To encourage in-service candidates to work in rural, tribal, or difficult areas, the MCI has provided additional 10% marks for each year of service, subject to a maximum of 30% additional marks obtained by them in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET).According to Thorat, Dr Bhute has served in rural areas for seven years and last year sought 30℅ additional weightage, but the department refused to give him the maximum marks, prompting him to move HC. On his petition, the court on March 12, 2019, directed the department to extend additional weightage as contemplated by the MCI notification to in-service candidates who have served in rural areas. Despite the direction, the department refused to give the 30% weightage to Dr Bhute, giving rise to a second round of the litigation.On Tuesday, assistant government pleader Rina Salunke pointed out that the department had on March 19, 2019, issued a GR varying the weightage of marks to be given. It had decided to provide 10% weightage for rendering service in tribal areas, 7% weightage for rendering service in difficult areas, and 4% for rendering service in rural areas. She also pointed out that the scheme contemplates reckoning only three years of service for giving these additional marks to in-service candidates.Justice Gupte, however, refused to accept the last contention. The judge said that none of the GRs on the topic reckons only three years of service. “For each year of completed service, the in-service candidates are entitled to marks in accordance with the altered scheme of marks,” said the judge, adding, “It is accordingly clarified that the entire service, whatever be the length of such service, of in-service candidates is to be reckoned for allotting weightage of marks for postgraduate admissions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pg-med-admissions-hc-reprieve-for-in-service-candidates/story-mfMi2UvNfJ6mWDCsCs9l7K.html

The administration is yet to take a decision on the matter.On March 28, amid the nationwide lockdown over the Covid-19 outbreak, the institute announced an early summer vacation for students from April 1 to May 31, 2020. It, however, did not clarify the status of the spring semester examinations which are usually held in the month of March. Last week, rumours were rife that the institute had cancelled the exams altogether causing anxiety among many students. However, on Wednesday, IIT Bombay director Subhasis Chaudhuri dispelled the rumours and said a final decision was pending.“During the time of such a pandemic, such rumours add to the agony and anxiety of our students who are away from the campus right now. Please stop such fake news. Our Senate will take a decision on this soon and it will be reported on the institute’s website and all students will be informed,” said Chaudhuri.While academic and research activities remain suspended at the institute since March 14, the institute shut for summer vacations on April 1 and examinations remain deferred.An expert committee formed by the central government last month had suggested that universities hold online examinations. Meanwhile, different IITs have chalked out plans to conduct exams in batches while maintaining the social distancing guidelines laid down by the central government. While IIT Roorkee has prioritised its final year students for the completion of semester, IIT Madras may allow its students to take their exams at the nearest IIT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/iit-bombay-asks-students-not-to-believe-rumours-about-cancellation-of-exams/story-kK4rdSnLD1hAwfUAKCa2GO.html

Some have also retrenched staff, with the unorganised sector being hit the most. The unemployment rate in India touched 27 per cent in the week to May 3, according to think-tank CMIE. “What seemed like a 2-3 months phenomenon in the beginning, has turned out to be a pandemic with serious implications on both lives and livelihood. More importantly, it is increasingly clear that the pandemic is not going away anytime soon,” Kotak’s group chief Human Resources officer Sukhjit S Pasricha said in an internal note.  The move to recalibrate salaries is driven by the objective of business sustainability, Pasricha said.“We have decided on a 10 per cent reduction in CTC (cost to company) for all colleagues with a salary of more than Rs 25 lakh per annum, with effect from May 2020 for FY21,” the note said.Quoting the bank’s Managing Director Uday Kotak, the note said, “we are into unchartered waters and only time will tell how we as a firm, as an economy, as a country, as a world, as humanity, emerge from this momentous event.” The group and Kotak himself had earlier announced donations to the PM-CARES Fund and also the Maharashtra chief minister’s relief fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/kotak-mahindra-bank-declares-10-pay-cut-for-staff-with-over-rs-25-lakh-annual-salary/story-4TXZxEw9XHYKlrWnfi6IoO.html
07-05-2020||Arts||An ode to Irrfan, in a Mumbai alley||About two days back, the late actor Irrfan Khan’s elder son Babil Khan shared a story on his social media — it was a large mural of his father donning the bylanes of Waroda Road in Bandra. The mural is made by Ranjit Dahiya, a 42-year-old artist based in Mumbai. “I liked him a lot, and his death was very unfortunate. I have made many murals of Bollywood actors in different parts of Mumbai so I thought why not give Irrfan a tribute too,” says Dahiya, founder of Bollywood Art Project, a collective of street artists. The artwork is mixed in colours of black, white and yellow, and is a close-up shot of the late actor. Dahiya, who started painting the mural on the day Irrfan passed away, says, “I was very sad. We lost one of Bollywood’s gems. The idea to make his mural came from my heart.”When asked if there were any restrictions while painting the mural as Mumbai continues to battle Covid-19, he says, “We took all the necessary precautions. I was helped by a friend. Him and I, both maintained social distance while painting, and tried not to speak to anyone who passed us by on the road.”Dahiya, originally from Sonepat, Haryana, and a graduate of the National Institute of Design (NID), Ahmedabad, came to Mumbai years ago for a job. “Before going to college though, I used to paint slogans on the streets and did a lot of whitewash related odd jobs. I guess that taught me how to make large size murals.”Just adjacent to Waroda Road is Chapel Road which is adorned with murals of the late actors Sridevi and Madhubala, which too were Dahiya’s way of paying respect to them. Dahiya now plans to paint a Rishi Kapoor mural. He says, “He too was one of my favourite actors. I grew up watching his films. We are looking for a wall and we are also looking for people who can help us with purchasing paints and leathers as this is a financially difficult time for us artists.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/an-ode-to-irrfan-in-a-mumbai-alley/story-ryzbr1dv26vLvMVWwWoXAN.html

Liquor contractors blamed the UT administration for this, saying people had already smuggled liquor from Chandigarh into Mohali in the absence of checks at borders.About 140 liquor vends in the district remained open from 7am to 3pm, but none reported major sales, unlike Chandigarh.“We have already suffered a huge loss (because of the lockdown) and now blame Chandigarh authorities for opening the vends earlier on May 4 and collecting around Rs 20 crore a day. Mohali residents have been getting liquor from Chandigarh and no checks are being carried out at the borders,” said JP Singh, general manager of the Turtle Group owning 15 liquor vends here.Another liquor contractor, Arjun Singh, said, “Though our rates are more or less comparable with Chandigarh, the Punjab government should not have allowed home delivery. We should have also been given some relief as most of the migrant workers, our main customers for country liquor and regular segments have left the city.”In his Wednesday order, deputy commissioner of Mohali, Girish Dayalan said vends could open from 7am to 3pm, but no shop would be open in the open in the containment areas of Jawahapur village in in Dera Bassi and Nayagaon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-queues-crowds-as-mohali-liquor-vends-open-after-six-weeks/story-7FawSn8S77ove4WIecdqcJ.html

Senior superintendent of police, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Alka Meena said the portal will help the police keep an eye on persons with travel history from other states or districts. On how the system will work, she said the medical team at checkpoints will check travellers and details of each person will be filed through the portal. Fourteen inter-district checkpoints where this portal has been made functional with the help of tabs will maintain data on the entrants, Meena added.As details of all entrants will be available on one platform, authorities will then be able to screen or quarantine every entrant in their districts.Since the inter-state movement of people has increased, it is important to ensure that no person goes unchecked and is examined and quarantined appropriately to stop the spread of Covid-19 in the district, said deputy superintendent of police and nodal officer for Covid-19, Deepika Singh.

Criticising the Punjab government’s decision, Giani Harpreet Singh on Thursday said the move was ridiculous as places of worship, which act as immunity boosters, were closed but liquor was being sold. “Sale of liquor should not be allowed. Shopping malls, cloth stores and other shops are closed. Why are liquor sales being prioritised? The move will also cause an increase in cases of domestic violence,” he said, during a media interaction at the Akal Takht Secretariat.“All temples, mosques and gurdwaras have been closed by the government. Where will people go to express their devotion? People’s devotion acts like an immunity booster and is key in the fight against Covid-19,”he said. On places of worship in Muktsar being asked to announce on loud speakers that liquor vends had opened, the jathedar said the incident was unfortunate. TREAT COVID-19 PATIENTS RESPECTFULLY He condemned the vilification of Nanded pilgrims who had tested positive for Covid-19. “Those infected are victims, not criminals, and they should be treated respectfully. Strict action should be taken against those who make derogatory remarks against them,” the jathedar said.“First, attempts were made to target the sangat, which had gathered at Sri Anandpur Sahib during the Holla Mohalla festival after Baldev Singh of Nawanshahr tested positive for Covid-19. Then, our NRI brothers from Punjab were targeted. Now, the pilgrims who returned from Takht Hazur Sahib, Nanded, are being vilified, which is condemnable”, said Giani Harpreet Singh.‘ONLY PILGRIMS BEING BLAMED’ The jathedar said, “Punjabi workers from Maharashtra had also joined pilgrims at Nanded to avail the transport facility being provided. They took shelter at the gurdwara there, which was not wrong, but, only the pilgrims are being defamed.”“This vilification drive against pilgrims will not be tolerated. No person, who tests positive for the coronavirus, should be treated like a criminal.”On quarantining Nanded-returnees in congregation halls of Dera Radha Soami, the Akal Takht jathedar said, “There are no accommodation arrangements at deras. These deras have only sheds not rooms and rapidly heat up during the day, but pilgrims are forced to live in them. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has appealed the government to shift them to gurdwara serais, which have rooms, but the government seems adamant on keeping them at deras.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/akal-takht-jathedar-slams-reopening-of-liquor-vends-says-will-lead-to-domestic-violence/story-rv30j5rq3JKbF8LhcpbEcO.html
07-05-2020||Delhi||Plea in Delhi HC to start online sale of liquor to ensure social distancing||A plea was filed in the Delhi High Court seeking direction to the AAP government to start online sale of liquor to ensure social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic as people turned out in large numbers crowding such shops after they opened this week increasing the risk of spreading the virus.As an alternative prayer, the plea has sought introduction of a token system at liquor shops that will help in crowd management. The petition is likely to come up for hearing on May 11.Petitioner Sajag Nijhawan referred to various media reports highlighting instances of crowds gathering at liquor shops since they opened on May 4, without maintaining social distancing and leading to law and order situation.It alleged there was a failure on the part of the AAP government in taking appropriate steps to control the large gathering in and around 150 government-run liquor shops which were opened after 47 days.Hundreds of people turned up outside the liquor shops, creating a complete chaos as social distancing norms were not adhered to and forcing the police to use mild force to disperse the unruly crowd, it said.The petition, filed through advocates Simran Kohli and Abheehshek Bhagat, sought direction to the Delhi government and its Excise Department to take immediate steps in view of the coronavirus or Covid-19 pandemic to control the crowds outside the liquor shops and to ensure strict adherence to social distancing.It sought direction to the Delhi government to evolve a proper policy to start the online sale of liquor and deliver it to the consumers’ homes at a time when the entire machinery of the country is tirelessly working to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.The petition said it does not seek closing of these shops considering the burden on the government to deal with major revenue dip, but was seeking judicial order for appropriate steps to balance the need of revenue generation as well as social distancing. Another PIL was filed by NGO Civil Safety Council of India in the high court on Wednesday seeking direction to the Delhi government to close the liquor shops in the national capital until the situation of Covid-19 pandemic is under control. It is likely to come up for hearing on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/plea-in-delhi-hc-to-start-online-sale-of-liquor-to-ensure-social-distancing/story-OA2cTyaeNQXEF0evcLbOsL.html

It has unauthorised copies of all the study material provided on the corporation’s official website for Class 1-12,” said its managing director Ranjit Kumar Singh.The MD said that due to the app ‘Bihar textbooks & CBSE books’, the students as well as teachers were getting confused. “The corporation has not launched any such app so far. The corporation takes exception to this app as it is a clear case of copyright violation, as no permission was sought from the corporation prior to launching the app,” he addedMaintaining that earning through the unauthorised app was a case of cyber crime, the corporation has warned the students and teachers to not use it, as it was fake. “Besides, the app also shows some old study material. When the corporation will launch its own app, it will be communicated,” said the MD, adding that chapter wise study material for all the classes had been made available on the corpoeayion’s website and the students could download them from there.However, despite the alleged fraud, the corporation has not lodged any case against it.Earlier, the corporation used to provide free books to the students, but due to delayed printing and more delayed distribution, the government decided four years ago to provide money for books in the bank accounts of students so that they could buy it on their own. Though in that case also, many kind of books copying the corporation’s material reportedly flooded the market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/bihar-govt-warns-students-teachers-against-fake-app-for-study-material/story-9MlcSbmnqRy0KWcDDKECwK.html

The parrot belonged to an inspector and went missing on Tuesday.The inspector Ram Kripal, posted in the PAC, claimed that his neighbour had stolen the parrot and the bird was with the neighbours who claimed that they owned the parrot.When the matter reached the Ashiana police station, the station in-charge, in an Akbar-Birbal style of judgment, said that he would open the cage and the ownership would be decided by the parrot.“The parrot will obviously go to its master,” he told both the claimants.As soon as the station in-charge opened the cage, the parrot without much ado flew out into the open sky embracing its new found independence, while both the claimants returned to their homes disappointed that the bird had disowned them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/it-s-viral/parrot-asked-to-choose-its-owner-flies-to-freedom-instead/story-L3tXuTtPWRQPUed2LFDrdK.html

07-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Police ex-DGP Sumedh Singh Saini booked in 29-year-old kidnapping case||CHANDIGARH: Punjab Police have registered a case against their former chief Sumedh Singh Saini in connection with the disappearance of Balwant Singh Multani in 1991.Saini was the Chandigarh senior superintendent of police at that time. Multani was picked up by two officers after a terrorist attack on Saini in Chandigarh in which four cops in his security were killed.The case was registered under Sections 364 (kidnapping or abduction in order to murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 344 (wrongful confinement), 330 (voluntarily causing hurt to exhort confession) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) in Mohali on Wednesday evening. A complaint about Multani’s kidnapping was lodged by his brother.A Central Bureau of Investigation probe was initiated in this case against Saini in 2007 on the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court but it was later quashed by Supreme Court.When contacted, Saini, who is said to be in Delhi, said: “What comments are required when a chief minister joins hands with anti-national elements to settle personal scores for having him booked for corruption?”Saini has been in the crosshairs of the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government since the sacrilege cases of 2015 surfaced. He had challenged the Vigilance Bureau’s closure report in the Ludhiana City Centre scam in which Amarinder was an accused. DENIED ENTRY TO HIMACHAL WITHOUT PASSHours after the FIR was registered against Saini and seven other cops at Mataur police station in Mohali district, the former police chief was stopped from entering Himachal Pradesh at the state’s border with Punjab in the wee hours on Thursday as he was not carrying a valid pass for inter-state travel.Bilaspur superintendent of police (SP) Devakar Sharma said that Saini, accompanied by two persons, in a Toyota Innova arrived at the the Gara-Mora inter-state barrier near Swarghat in the district at 4am without a valid entry pass. “When police personnel manning the barrier stopped the vehicle, one of the occupants claimed that he was a former Punjab DGP and was headed to Karsog in Mandi district,” Sharma said. A person accompanying him said that he was an inspector-rank officer, while the other was an assistant sub-inspector.Saini owns an ancestral farmhouse at Karsog.However, the police personnel at the border told the trio that entry was not allowed without a valid pass. “The guard at the barrier then informed Naina Devi deputy superintendent of police (DSP), who eventually informed me,” said Sharma.“Later, the former DGP called me up with a request to allow them to enter the state, which was turned town,” the SP added.

07-05-2020||Kolkata||TMC lashes out at Union home secretary Bhalla over Indo-Bangla cargo movement issue||The ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal on Wednesday denied charges levelled by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla that the state government is not allowing movement of essential goods through the Indo- Bangladesh border, and claimed the senior official is “trying to please his political bosses in Delhi”.Accusing the Union government of sending less number of testing kits and “faulty” equipment to the state, the party leaders said that was why the number of tests conducted is low.Senior TMC leader and MP Sougata Roy said, “The central government is playing a political game and is using the services of bureaucrats who are obligated to the political leadership of the central government.” “Otherwise they would have known that state has not objected to the opening of the borders for cargo movement. It had to be stopped because of tremendous local agitation. As we dont believe in using police force, talks have started with the locals so that services can be resumed,” he told PTI.Officials of the Petrapole land port authorities on Tuesday said they are trying to hold talks with local people and the state government in order to resume Indo-Bangladesh trade, which was stopped on May 2 after two days of operation following protests by local people.They had said villagers are afraid that truck drivers and labourers might spread coronavirus infection when they return from Benapole, located on the other side of the border and has been affected by the disease.In a letter to West Bengal Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha earlier in the day, the Union home secretary slammed the state government for not allowing movement of essential goods through the Indo-Bangladesh border, saying such acts violate the Constitution and will have international implications.The Union home ministry also criticized the West Bengal government over its Covid-19 management in another letter. Referring to the second letter by Bhalla, Roy said the union home secretarys letter has a “subliminal political tilt, which is devoid of facts and figures”. “As far as Covid-19 management is concerned, West Bengal is doing its best. It ranks 10th in terms of infected people. But the Centre is not sending letters to states such as Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, where the number of such people is much higher,” the senior TMC leader said.“If at all there is short of tests, the fault lies entirely with the Centre, which has not only sent less number of kits but those faulty Chinese kits are faulty also. The state government is also doing its best to enforce stricter lockdown,” Roy said.The West Bengal government alleged last month that the Covid-19 testing kits supplied by the NICED, the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) nodal agency in the state, were “apparently defective”.The NICED had then withdrawn the consignment of defective Covid-19 testing kits from some of the state-run laboratories in West Bengal. Another senior TMC leader and MP Manas Bhunia claimed that Centre is trying to wash its hands off by constantly blaming the state government. “It was the Centre which had sent less number of kits, and the majority of them are faulty. If you don’t give us kits, how will we conduct tests?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/tmc-lashes-out-at-union-home-secretary-bhalla-over-indo-bangla-cargo-movement-issue/story-MAlfgk7Qws0X5gUD7YhGuI.html
07-05-2020||Chandigarh||Jalandhar’s Rs 1800-crore sports industry may not revive after Covid-19 setback, say traders||The district’s sports industry, which was already in doldrums due to increasing price of labour and high tax slabs, has been hit hard by the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, so much so that traders believe that it is unlikely that the industry will revive once the situation normalises. Jalandhar’s sports industry once estimated to be worth Rs 1,800 crore, catered to over 55% of the country’s demand, now, with thousands of migrant labourers leaving the city, the future of the industry seems bleak.SHORTAGE OF LABOUR, RAW MATERIALTraders say, at present, Jalandhar’s market share is around 30% as several units have been shut down over the decade due to losses. More units are expected to shut shop as raw material and labour become unavailable and dearer.The industry also exports to the United Kingdom, South Africa, Germany, France, Netherlands, New Zealand, Australia and some other nations.Jalandhar Sports Forum president Ravinder Dhir said now Meerut had become the main sports market of the country as the local government there is supportive of the traders. “Leather and labour are also available at cheaper rates,” he said. FINANCIAL STIMULUS NEEDED“There were around 70 units of leather ball manufacturers before 2010. However, at present, only 10-15 of them are in business,” Dhir said. “The industry will not revive unless a special financial package is not released by the government. People will anyway not purchase sports equipment amid the pandemic,” Dhir said.‘GOVT MUSTN’T LET LABOURERS RETURN’Another trader, Vipan Prinja of Marshall Exports, said all industrialists had taken care of the labours in their employ, and had provided them with essential services and money for past two months. However, as soon as the government allowed us to run the units, they permitted the labourers to return. “In the absence of labour, how can we run our units?” Prinja asked. CAPT APPRISED OF INDUSTRY’S WOESDhir said he had also written to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh in this regard on Wednesday.Sports manufacturers say they had little hope for business this year. “The future of the Indian Premier League and Cricket World Cup is under the shadow. Labour, too, is unlikely to return anytime soon. With all national and international borders sealed the industry has been hit hard,” said Vikas Jain of Jainson International.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jalandhar-s-rs-1800-crore-sports-industry-may-not-revive-after-covid-19-setback-say-traders/story-1OscDWfM3AOR2CJUHR9mXL.html

07-05-2020||Chandigarh||As part of Haryana’s diversification drive, farmers opting for non-paddy crops to get Rs 7,000 per acre||CHANDIGARH: In its first firm crop diversification push, the Haryana government has decided to buy maize and pulses at the minimum support price (MSP).This was announced by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar while launching the ambitious Mera Pani Meri Virasat scheme during his address on the Haryana Aaj programme on Wednesday evening.Appealing to farmers to save water, Khattar said, “Under the Mera Pani-Meri Virasat scheme, farmers switching over to an alternative crop in place of paddy during this season will be given an incentive of Rs 7,000 per acre.”The crop diversification drive of the BJP-JJP coalition government comes ahead of the paddy transplantation season that begins on June 15. Haryana produces near 68 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of paddy, including over 25 LMT of basmati.The land under paddy transplantation across the state is about 32 lakh acres.In one acre, about 30 quintal paddy (parmal) is produced and a farmer earns around Rs 30,000 per acre after excluding the input cost that is over Rs 20,000 per acre.Haryana’s agricultural production programmes have been determined by the need for national food security. The Centre gives a remunerative price, leading to certainty among farmers for marketing for paddy. Because of the assured marketing of the paddy under MSP even non-rice producing areas have taken up paddy production on a large scale.The cultivation of paddy has contributed to the degradation of natural resources such as water and soil. The groundwater table of Haryana has been declining steadily.36 BLOCKS IN DARK ZONEAccording to Khattar, 36 blocks of the state have become dark zones where the ground level water depletion rate has doubled in 12 years. It means that where the ground water level was earlier at 20 metres, it has now depleted to 40 metres.There are 19 such blocks, where the water depth has exceeded 40 metres. However, out of these 19, there are 11 blocks in which paddy is not sown.Eight paddy-rich blocks, including Ratia, Siwan, Guhla, Pipli, Shahabad, Babain, Ismailabad and Sirsa, where the depth of groundwater level exceeds 40 metres, would be included in this scheme.The land under the panchayat having ground water depth of more than 35 metres will not get permission to sow paddy. However, the incentive amount will be given to the panchayat only.Apart from these blocks, if the farmers of the remaining blocks also want to stop sowing paddy, they can apply for the incentive amount by giving information in advance.80% SUBSIDY FOR MICRO-IRRIGATIONKhattar has urged the farmers to make up their minds to sow crops which require less water than paddy, such as maize, arhar, urad, guar, cotton, bajra, til and grishm moong (Baisakhi moong), to ensure the availability of water for future generations.The state government is giving 80% subsidy to the farmers who have adopted micro-irrigation and drip irrigation system along with growing alternative crops in place of paddy.Khattar has appealed to the farmers of the state to promote water conservation and save water for future generations in the same way they leave their land as inheritance for their coming generations.

About 40% of the patients injured in accidents need orthopaedic treatment. This building is the only one in the state providing artificial limbs and also running PG (postgraduate) course,” said Arvind Nigam, secretary of the orthotics and prosthetics association, UP chapter, and former incharge of the workshop in the department.The medical university is currently running an isolation facility in its infectious disease department building but is looking at the option to dedicate more beds for Covid-19 patients.Prof SN Sankhwar, chief medical superintendent of KGMU, said, “We are coordinating with HoDs of the department that run in the building. The facility will come up in a way that does not harm patient care.”The building has 300 points for oxygen supply and the medical university is planning to set up 200 beds for the isolation facility, according to those in the know of things. Oxygen supply will be maintained with the help of large cylinders. “The building is expected to be ready in the next two weeks,” said Prof Sandip Tiwari, head of the department of trauma surgery. He is looking after oxygen supply on the campus.The staff members, however, said the isolation facility should be set up away from residential areas. “The best option will be to make an isolation facility take some big college outside the city,” said a staff of the RALC.A 14-member committee was also formed to decide how the building will be utilised for coronavirus patients. The employee teachers’ joint front has written a letter to the principal secretary, medical education, to review the proposal by KGMU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/kgmu-staff-against-using-limb-centre-building-for-covid-19-patients/story-b7EOTUr25THSfS3xx2cuKL.html

A number of city dwellers have also planned a special treat for the strays in their locality. Arnab Halder, a teacher assistant at an NGO and an animal lover, says, “I love to meditate and chant, but this Buddha Purnima, I’m cooking special treats for all the stray dogs in my colony. I’m an animal lover and wanted to do something special for the animals in my city.” Those who used to celebrate this day traditionally, say that they have planned to not to miss the same, and will yet maintain social distancing. “This used to be a big festival for us. But, amid the lockdown we can’t go and pray at our monastery. That’s why I’ll be connecting with my Buddhist teacher over a video call, for a meditation session,” says Anamika Shrivatsav, a student of a Noida-based private university. Monasteries in Delhi have also planned to light up lamps and pray for this pandemic to end. Thinlay Namgyal, an office secretary of an NGO Karmapa International Buddhist Society, says, “There will be vast lamp lighting with aspirational prayers for the entire world during these challenging times.

So far, over 10 lakh labourers have registered themselves to leave for their home states, including over 5 lakh from Ludhiana, an industrial hub.Industrialists also urged political parties not to play politics over the issue and stop the labourers from leaving the state.President of the Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisations (FICO) Gurmeet Singh Kular said, “It is unfortunate for the industry that chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh is allowing workers to move out. Industry will not be able to recover itself this way.”Kular added that the government should not start trains for migrant labourers for at least 45 days after the lockdown.President of the United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) DS Chawla said, “Immediate steps should be taken to stop the labourers from leaving, and political parties should also not make it an issue. It is ironical that, on the one hand, the government is encouraging the industry to commence operations and on the other hand, it is allowing the labourers to return home. How will the industries run without workers?”“The government should take steps to retain the workforce, otherwise the industry, already facing an uncertain future, will suffer a lot,” said president of the Knitwear and Textile Club Vinod Thapar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-industry-hails-karnataka-decision-not-to-allow-labourers-to-leave-the-state/story-VGJ5ffyOkUNQoOGeZi4VjJ.html

07-05-2020||Mumbai||IIT-B develops way to detect asymptomatic Covid patients||A multi-institute research team led by the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) has developed a new testing protocol that could help identify asymptomatic carriers of the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19.The 28-member team comprises researchers from IIT-B, National Centre for Biological Sciences, InStem, Harvard University, Harvard Medical School, SASTRA University and the Mumbai-based start-up, Shop101. Tapestry, the new testing method, is described as “a single-round smart pooling technique for Covid-19 testing”. With Tapestry, one swab sample is sent to three pools. If a sample tests positive, samples in the remaining two pools will also test positive. Tapestry has been validated through laboratory experiments with synthetic RNA and DNA fragments. Results have been confirmed using computer simulation.“The algorithm describes a novel way to pool samples and test in a single step, thereby conserving resources and increasing testing capacity by increasing throughput,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, who was not involved in the study and is a pulmonologist at PD Hinduja Hospital in Mahim.The researchers believe Tapestry could help identify asymptomatic carriers of the virus. “The peculiarity we are seeing with Covid-19 is asymptomatic individuals are carriers and can spread the virus. The only way to combat this is either you put everyone under lockdown or test everyone; neither of which are desirable options. One option is to test as many as possible in a cost-effective way, and one way to do it is by pooling samples,” said Manoj Gopalkrishnan, principal investigator and associate professor, department of electrical engineering, IIT-B.Tapestry’s method is unlike the technique of pooling samples approved by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), which requires at least multiple rounds of testing if a sample from a pool tests positive. Each round of testing takes four hours.Pooling test samples based on ICMR norms involves placing a mixture of five different swab samples in a pool, extracting the virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) and conducting a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test that spans four hours at one go. A positive pool indicates that at least one person is infected but the individual’s identity is not known. What follows is retesting and separately extracting virus RNA from each of the five samples from the pool.“Pooling is a good method and should be deployed more widely. But two rounds of pooling takes eight hours. Our protocol can test 1,000 people in 100 tests and recover up to 10 positives,” said Gopalkrishnan, adding that the single-round pooling technique allows for more extensive testing, which would help identify asymptomatic carriers. “For instance, medical staff, police personnel, delivery personnel, residents in high-density locations or organisations that want to bring employees back can undergo pool testing every day or at least once in two or three days,” said Gopalkrishnan.The team has also developed an app where laboratory technicians can enter the viral load seen in the test. The algorithm, deployed on the cloud, will then make the calculations and give the test results. Once permissions come through and clinical trials are successful, the team will approach the ICMR to consider deploying Tapestry in testing centres as well as other institutions such as hospitals and airports.“Tapestry needs to be validated on clinical specimens, in which the quantum of RNA extracted from each nasopharyngeal swab, pre-test probability, prevalence will all vary across different states/cities,” said Pinto.In the second phase, the team plans to undertake clinical trials at five testing centres across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-b-develops-way-to-detect-asymptomatic-covid-patients/story-MAZYeTlgcg1qqMpiRfsKkN.html
07-05-2020||Lucknow||Senior member of Tablighi Jamat dies in Jaunpur||Senior member of Tablighi Jamat and Jaunpur area chief of the outfit Nasim Ahamd (65) died of illness in Jaunpur in the wee hours on Wednesday, said a senior official of the Jaunpur administration, adding that Nasim had been suffering from heart disease. However, the body was sent for post mortem examination.The officer, who did not wish to be named, said that on April 2 a case was registered against Nasim for giving shelter to 16 Tablighi Jamat members, including 14 Bangladeshi nationals, who returned to Jaunpur in the last week of March after attending the Jamat event in Delhi. All 16 Jamatis, including the 14 Bangladeshis, were caught in a house in Lal Darwaja area of Jaunpur city on March 29. They were kept in a quarantine centre. Later, their samples were tested and two of the 16 were found positive for corona virus in the first week of April.The officer added that Nasim was arrested on April 2 after police registered the case on charges of giving shelter Bangladeshi nationals and hiding information about Jamatis present in the city. Nasim reportedly helped arrange a rented house for the Jamatis.The officer added that after being arrested on April 2, Naseem was kept in a quarantine centre in Jaunpur for 14 days. Thereafter he was shifted to a temporary jail on April 17. A week ago, he took ill and was shifted to the district hospital from where he was referred to the BHU. After his condition improved, he was again shifted to the temporary jail two days ago.During the wee hours on Wednesday at around 1.30am, Nasim took ill again and he was immediately rushed to the district hospital where doctors examined him and declared him dead. His kin reached the district hospital on getting information.Sub divisional magistrate and superintendent of temporary jail Nitish Kumar Singh said that Nasim was suffering from heart disease. The exact cause of death would be clear from his post mortem examination report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/senior-member-of-tablighi-jamat-dies-in-jaunpur/story-U8HnfajfSVSSSe06rkzCqI.html
07-05-2020||Mumbai||No FIRs against doctors: BMC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided not to go ahead with its plans to prosecute doctors prescribing Covid-19 tests to people without physical examination. The Union health ministry’s guidelines for Covid-19 testing, issued on March 21, stated: “Laboratory test should only be offered when prescribed by a qualified physician as per the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) guidelines.”But the BMC has found out that some doctors are violating the guidelines by providing prescriptions for tests without physical examination. Recently, a doctor from Delhi prescribed Covid test to a resident of Mumbai. The private laboratory informed BMC officers, who after investigation found out the doctor didn’t even check the suspected patient physically. “It is important to examine the person physically to check if the suspected patient has any breathing problem or fever. Just because a person is anxious and wants to undergo a test, it should not be allowed by wrongfully prescribing a test,” said a ward officer who is aware of the development. Taking note of it, BMC decided to file FIRs against doctors indulging in malpractice by violating the rules of the state and Centre. A sample form available with HT indicated BMC wanted to charge doctors under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant) and the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. The document reads: “With reference to above subject matter, Dr (name) has placed requisition for Covid-19 test to (name) laboratory without physical examination of (name) patient, which is in violation of Covid-19 guidelines issued by MCGM/Government of Maharashtra/ICMR.”“Earlier, we planned to start filing FIRs against the doctors. But later, we held a meeting with private practitioners and decided to put the decision on hold. However, we are going to take stringent action against doctors if they are found issuing fake prescriptions,” said Manish Valaniu, L ward officer. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), said it would have demotivated doctors from practising. “Despite having no personal protective equipment (PPE), we are screening and treating patients. We aren’t some local criminals for FIRs to be filed against us. It would have been too harsh to arrest doctors during the ongoing pandemic,” he said. He also suggested that doctors shouldn’t prescribe test without examination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-firs-against-doctors-bmc/story-6VyxkRnAc8xtQAersoxxDO.html
07-05-2020||Mumbai||Maha sees record 24-hour spike of 1,233 infections||Maharashtra on Wednesday recorded its highest single-day jump of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases with 1,233 infections, taking the tally to 16,758. It also recorded 34 deaths on Wednesday, taking the toll to 651. Maharashtra’s doubling rate currently stands at 10 days, as it crossed the 8,000-mark on April 26.Of the new cases, Mumbai recorded 769 Covid-19 cases, taking the state capital’s tally to 10,714. Of the deaths registered on Wednesday, 25 were in Mumbai, three each in Pune and Akola, and one each in Jalgaon and Solapur. A resident of Uttar Pradesh died in Mumbai. The toll in Mumbai is now 412.Mumbai alone accounts for 63.93% of the cases in the state and therefore the state government is focusing on strengthening medical infrastructure in view of a likely spike in the number of cases. As per one of the several projections of the Central government (and going by the current doubling rate of 10 days), Mumbai could see around 29,000 cases by mid-May.According to a senior bureaucrat, the Centre had projected a spike in mid-May and by the end of the month. Therefore the state is acting to make the necessary arrangements. The official said that the state is ramping up the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ordering around 15,000 private doctors in Mumbai to go on Covid-19 duty.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray interacted with Central agencies, including the Indian Army, Indian Navy, Ministry of Railways and Mumbai Port Trust, on the matter of availability of their hospitals in Mumbai, Pune and other major cities as “part of preparedness”.“As part of the planning, the State Government has requested hospitals, institutions & buildings under the management of the Railways, Mumbai Port Trust, Indian Army, Navy and other Central Gov. undertakings to make their facilities available across Maharashtra. This is to make sure there is availability of ICU beds & isolation centres as a part of preparedness,” the chief minister’s office tweeted.State health minister Rajesh Tope held a meeting with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on the preparation and planning related to the pandemic. Tope said that the state has issued a notification, making it mandatory for private doctors in Mumbai to report to hospitals for treatment of Covid-19 patients.“The decision on private doctors was taken, considering the demand in the coming day. Currently, as per the Department of Medical Education and Research (DMER), there are about 15,000 doctors in Mumbai who are at home. I appeal to private doctors that the state needs you now and they should participate in this work. The services of the doctors would primarily be for Mumbai. If needed, their services can be used elsewhere as well,” Tope told reporters on Wednesday.The state government has asked private doctors who are below age of 55 and ones without comorbidity to report with immediate effect to Covid-19 dedicated hospitals for treatment of patients, the minister said. Failure to report to the hospital will lead to their medical license being revoked. The government has invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act, Disaster Management Act, and Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act to issue the above-mentioned order.The minister added that outside Mumbai, private doctors should start their practices and assured that the state would provide them Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits through district collectors if required.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan has raised concerns as 34 out of the 36 districts in Maharashtra have Covid-19 cases. He later spoke to the chief minister and assured all help required to keep the number of cases in check. Tope, in the meeting with the Union minister, also took up the issue of making hospitals under the Central agencies available to Maharashtra. The patients who have tested positive and are asymptomatic can be kept in train coaches that are repurposed as isolation wards by the Indian Railways. “We have sought the availability of hospitals from Central agencies. During the meeting, the Union minister said that the Army and Navy hospitals should be kept as a last resort. For now, he would speak to the Railways [for its facilities],” he said.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is looking at reviewing its guidelines for discharge of asymptomatic patients by reducing the period they have to be kept in hospital from 14 days to seven days. “We are awaiting new guidelines from the ICMR. They would reduce the period from 14 days to seven. Besides the number of tests required before discharging them from the hospital may also be reduced from two tests to one,” the minister said. The move would also help make more hospital beds available in hospitals.Maharashtra, which has 54 testing laboratories including 24 private labs, has so far tested 1,90,879 samples. Out of which, 1,73,838 have tested negative. “Daily we are testing around 8,000 to 10,000 samples. Maharashtra is number one in the count for tests per million. Due to all these reasons, too, we are seeing more cases,” Tope said.The mortality rate in the state has gone under 4%, even as the toll continues to rise. The number of patients discharged has crossed 3,000-mark on Wednesday with 275 people recovered. Mumbai civic chief Praveen Pardeshi gave a presentation on the preparedness plan for Mumbai, while Dr Sanjay Oak, under whom a taskforce has been set up to tackle coronavirus-related deaths, made a presentation on the treatment protocol for critical patients during the cabinet meeting held on Wednesday evening in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-sees-record-24-hour-spike-of-1-233-infections/story-VN4gZx64R59Mbe1vxkiWSN.html
07-05-2020||Lucknow||Like Muslims, Dalit group to also give ‘zakat’ to help migrants this Ramzan||A group of professionals from the Dalit community have announced to adopt the Islamic way of earmarking ‘zakat’ (charity) from their earnings and using it for the welfare of the lesser fortunate members of their society.Under the ‘Dalit Zakat’ initiative, these professionals, bureaucrats and businessmen, mostly from Uttar Pradesh, will compulsorily donate a small percentage of the income and used the sum for assisting the economically weak members of the community during the nationwide lockdown.“Our group was launched way back in 2003 and we have been assisting talented youths from our community in pursuing higher education. With Ramzan underway, and lockdown in place, we have decided to mobilize the resources to assist the poor members of the community, particularly the migrants,” said J Ram, a retired bureaucrat and the brain behind Bhartiya Dalit Zakat Foundation.“Before the start of the holy month of Ramzan, the Muslim religious organisations and clerics have called upon the members of their community to assist the poor during the nationwide lockdown with giving a small percentage of their surplus wealth as ‘zakat’ to the needy. Taking a cue, we have also decided to assist people in raising money, running kitchen and providing medical assistance to the deprived members of our community,” he said while claiming that the members of the Dalit Zakat foundation are spread across the state.“Due to lockdown we cannot hold meetings as majority of the members are following the Covid-19 guideline issued by the government by staying in their respective homes. We are using technology to raise the fund, transfer the money into account, contacting each other on the mobile to locate the needy and to hand over the money,” he said.Majority of the migrants returning home are from the Dalit and the backward community.“With limited resources, we know that it is not possible to assist all but we are zeroing in on the extremely poor, deprived and marginalized people in the rural and urban areas of the state. Large numbers of the Dalit students are facing hardship after their parents’ lost job. The Dalit Zakat Foundation has supported the talented students in pursuing the higher education. Several of them are employed they have also joined hand in donating a portion of their earning,” he said.The organisation has also launched Ramabai Ambedkar Uthan Samiti to assist the women in developing vocational skills.“We have already enrolled 300 Dalit women. They will learn tailoring skill to earn extra money for the family. We are planning to launch more such schemes for women to make them self-reliant. We have urged the members of the community to contribute from their saving to assist in the empowerment of the women,” said an office-bearer of the Dalit Zakat Foundation, SP Kureel.He said that not many are aware of the fact that Gautam Buddha was first to propagate the idea of alms giving. He called upon his followers to donate a part of their earning to the deprived.During diksha (initiation) to Buddhism at Nagpur on October 15, 1956, Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar spoke on the uplift of the Dalit community members. “Ambedkar called upon his followers to donate five percent of their earning as done by the Muslims for the social, religious and economic emancipation of the members of the community,” Kureel said while insisting that their organisation was apolitical.A group of students staying in Ambedkar Hostel in Gorakhpur have also adopted the principles of Zakat to run community kitchen for supplying food packets to the poor members of the community stuck in city in lockdown.“Along with contributing fund from savings, students have called upon the well-off among the community to contribute edible items or money to run the kitchen,” said Vinod Gautam, a student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/like-muslims-dalit-group-to-also-give-zakat-to-help-migrants-this-ramzan/story-wEKcoKTE33pIc2gwdq0lrN.html

Confirming the development, vice-chancellor (V-C) AS Nanda said the process will start soon after the university receives the requisite infrastructure. “We are in talks with the vice-chancellor of Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), Faridkot, Raj Bahadur, who is supervising the project. Once fully functional, minimum 400 tests will be conducted in a single day at the diagnostic lab of GADVASU,” Nanda added.To conduct Covid-19 tests, the university has sent 10 scientists – six to Government Medical College, Amritsar, and four to Government Medical College, Patiala – for training, GADVASU V-C said.Nanda said, “Due to the lockdown, mobility has been restricted. So some tasks are taking more than the usual time to get completed. But we are trying our best to start the facility soon.” He added that the veterinary varsity had trained the medical support staff in conducting the tests.“Scientists, including Dr Rajnish Sharma, Dr Mudit Chandra, Dr JS Arora, Dr Neeraj Singh, Dr Harsh Pawar and Dr Omar Khaleel Baba, have joined duty at Government Medical College, Patiala. Dr Mohan Jairath, Dr Deepali, Dr Jaspreet Kaur and Dr Astha Sharma are giving their services at Government Medical College, Amritsar,” the V-C said.Besides, the university has provided two PCR testing machines, one each to Government Medical College, Amritsar, and Government Medical College, Patiala, Nanda added.Besides DMCH, in Punjab, Covid-19 tests are also being conducted at BFUHS, Government Medical College, Amritsar, and Government Medical College, Patiala.MORE TESTING CENTRES IN STOREThe state government has also decided to rope in universities and state-run labs to conduct Covid-19 testing. The chief minister has sanctioned ₹12 crore for six such institutions to purchase required equipment.

07-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai fared better than global cities against Covid-19: Experts||For a city with a population of 12.44 million, 42% of which resides in informal settlements spread over just 8% of its landmass and the average density is 31,700 people per square kilometre (making it the second-most crowded city in the world), Mumbai has fared better than cities across the globe while fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, experts opine. A recent analysis by a think-tank, Observer Research Foundation (ORF), of the top 10 most-affected metropolitan areas (including New York, London, Madrid, Lombardy, and Ile De France) in the world reveals that urban agglomeration accounts for 32.19% of the total cases recorded in all the countries and 29.53% of the total deaths, on an average.However, as of Wednesday morning, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), which includes the city and its neighbouring areas, accounted for 25% of the total cases in India and 26% of the deaths in the country. The numbers were lower than New York (33.57% of total cases in the US), Lombardy (36.51% of cases in Italy), Flanders (58.67% of Belgium cases) and Hubei (82% of the total cases in China). Dhaval Desai, vice-president of ORF, Mumbai, who also authored the report, said Mumbai has done well when compared to medically-endowed cities across the globe. “The pandemic has exposed the weakness of even global cities like London and New York that boast of highly-advanced medical and public health systems,” Desai said. “With large informal settlements spread across the city, Mumbai has done largely well,” he added.When compared with Asian counterparts, Singapore, which was lauded for its response initially, has recorded 19,410 cases with 18 deaths. The city-state had not entered double-digits even till mid-March. Tokyo has recorded 4,654 cases, of which 1,589 were already discharged and 150 have died. South Korea’s Seoul has recorded 637 cases with two deaths. According to Pankaj Joshi, executive director at the city-based Urban Design Research Institute (UDRI), the city performed well owing to strategies like active primary health-care centres, pre-empting the lockdown, substantial response from the NGOs working on the field and early sealing of containment zones. “Many global cities reacted late, which was not the case in Mumbai. The lockdown was in place even before the country-wide lockdown was imposed,” Joshi said.A senior official from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said, “Decentralisation of power to local wards, aggressive contact tracing and testing, and getting quarantine facilities ready in time have helped the civic body in controlling the spread to a large extent.” However, experts feel the city also needs to strategise its long-term response to the pandemic, which also looks at mitigating scenarios like migrants crowding at Bandra station or social distancing norms being flouted with liquor shops being opened on Tuesday. Dr Anant Bhan, researcher, global health, bioethics and health policy, said that Mumbai’s response has to be more nuanced and well-resourced in the coming days with aggressive testing. “The civic body has to strategise a medium to long-term response which means investing more in resources and public health systems,” he said. “Delhi fared slightly better than Mumbai with the concept of mohalla clinics and more investment by the state government in the health sector. Although one cannot deny the neglect in the Nizamuddin event,” Bhan added.While major European cities planning and re-thinking responses to a post-Covid world, Mumbai is yet to draft a comprehensive strategy in that sector. Cities like Paris, London and Milan have started rebuilding streets to make them more pedestrian and bicycle-friendly. “We will have to do some major re-thinking in terms of urban planning, especially for slum rehabilitation in the city. Even mobility will need to be thought through before the city starts opening again,” Joshi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-fared-better-than-global-cities-against-covid-19/story-wYA6cqrUubVwaVorWJLIsM.html

07-05-2020||Mumbai||Andheri village sets trend in civic discipline||At a time when people in the city continue to flout social distancing and hygiene rules, a gaothan in Andheri (East) has become an example of civic discipline.Not only are the residents of Sahar village ensuring that they maintain social distancing, residents have also managed to raise close to ₹1 lakh in the last week to install three sanitisation walkways to help maintain cleanliness, especially in crowded areas.“We first saw a similar installation in a neighbouring area and we were informed that the local corporator helped set it up. We realised that we need something similar in our area as well because we are a large community and we wanted to make sure everyone is safe,” said 32-year-old Francis Fernandes, a resident. He and his friends contributed money to set up the first sanitisation walkway in their neighbourhood. Within a day, they were discussing the need for similar installations around the village.“We zeroed in on areas that witness maximum crowd, mostly to buy food and other essentials. The fish market attracts large crowds, so a local group of sports enthusiasts, called Glory Boyz, agreed to raise funds for the second installation,” said 29-year-old Maneesh Nair, a local who helped set up the sanitisation walkway. A third and similar set-up was placed near a milk booth, for which the locals raised funds and are maintaining the same. Zeist Interactive Solutions along with Experiatech helped the residents set up the sanitisation walkways.While there is no guarantee that the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, can be destroyed through the sanitisation walkway, locals feel it’s presence highlights the need for better sanitation in the area. “Many locals saw the entryway being set up and were sharing ideas of how a similar but smaller version can be placed outside homes. The idea is to ensure that everyone understands the need for better sanitisation,” said Fernandes. At present, the locals are collecting money to set up another walkway outside the local vegetable market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/andheri-village-sets-trend-in-civic-discipline/story-DF1Xyqd0LxhzFXwRNVcudM.html
07-05-2020||Noida||Shifts in-charge will be held responsible for violation of social distancing norms in offices||The shifts in-charge in offices will be held responsible if there are violations of social distancing and other standard operating (SOP) provisions at industries or offices, according to the new guidelines from the district administration. So far, the Noida authority and Greater Noida authority have issued permissions to around 400 units to resume operations with the norms of the nationwide lockdown, put in place to contain the Covid-19 spread, easing from May 3.The Uttar Pradesh government has directed officials of Gautam Budh Nagar district to allow industrial units and private offices to function. There are at least 12,000 industrial units in Noida and 10,000 units are located in Greater Noida, officials said. According to the procedures laid down, the district administration will first recommend the permission and then the Noida authority or the Greater Noida authority will issue the permission to a particular industry or office, allowing operations to begin. The Uttar Pradesh government has allowed these industry units and offices to operate on conditions such as staff strength will be kept to 33%, social distancing norms will be followed strictly, premises will disinfected regularly, and all Covid-19 related norms will be displayed prominently on notice boards, as well as inform the health department in case an employee falls sick symptoms.“Apart from following the SOPs, the shifts in-charge for the day will be held responsible if SOPs and social distancing norms are violated on the office/industrial unit premises. If a person is infected, then the unit owner or company owner will share the onus of taking care of the infected patient, the new guidelines stated,” Deep Chand, additional chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority, said.In Noida a total 1,800 units had applied for permission to resume operations. Of them, 180 were allowed and 120 applications were rejected on Tuesday. The authority is yet to calculate the number of permissions given on Wednesday. The Greater Noida authority had issued 165 permissions on Tuesday and Wednesday.“We are issuing permissions to units/offices that have submitted all required documents. We closely examine the documents and then grnt them permission, as per the laid down rules,” Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty, Noida authority, said. Meanwhile, factory owners demanded simplification of permission rules.“Officials are demanding so many documents before granting us permission. We have to submit papers such as our Aadhaar card, PAN number, property details and several other documents. Instead, they should just ask us for our GST (Goods and Services Tax) number. All details of a legitimate company are online under that number. By just keying in the number, the authority can immediately see if a unit is legal or not and then grant permission,” Pankaj Singh, president of Greater Noida Industrial Association, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/shifts-in-charge-will-be-held-responsible-for-violation-of-social-distancing-norms-in-offices/story-teHPqOgFm6tlkUuvcKTYtJ.html

Employees of these offices also do not need any passes and they have been asked to follow social distancing strictly at work. But, no employee residing in neighbouring states of Delhi and Haryana will be allowed to enter Gautam Budh Nagar district during the lockdown,” he said.The DM further said that apart from taking various safety measures and organising regular health camps in different localities to check for Covid-19 symptoms, the administration is also sensitizing the residents through awareness campaigns. “We have received a video clipping from the central government in this connection. We are sending this clip to all residents, to make them aware about the various safety measures to be taken to combat this pandemic. We are also making regular announcements about our health camps, so that they could turn up in large numbers for a thorough health check-up,” he said.Meanwhile, the Yogi Adityanath cabinet, on Wednesday, passed a stringent ordinance, amending the existing Epidemic Act, for providing legal protection to front-line health workers and the police in the state.Gautam Budh Nagar commissioner of police (CP) Alok Singh said according to the new ordinance, anyone assaulting or misbehaving with health workers will face imprisonment up to seven years and/or a fine of ₹5 lakh. “This ordinance covers health workers, paramedical personnel, police personnel, sanitation workers and other corona warrior deployed by the government,” he said.He further said that in case of jumping quarantine, the person may face a jail term of up to three years and/or fine of up to ₹1 lakh. “After this amendment, any deliberate attempt to spread this disease will attract harsher punishments, even a life sentence,” he said.BOX:Crime and punishment as per the new rule:Violation of quarantine rules: imprisonment of one to three years and fine of Rs 10,000 to Rs 1 lakhEscape from hospital: Jail of one to three years and fine of Rs 10,000 to Rs 1 lakhFor obscene and indecent conduct with corona warriors: jail of one to three years and fine of Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakhConcealing of corona cases: jail of one to three years and fine of Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakhIntentionally travelling at public places by corona patient: jail of one to three years and fine of Rs 50,000 to Rs 2 lakh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/no-interstate-movement-allowed-says-gb-nagar-admin-up-govt-ordinance-protect-corona-warriors/story-NGFEoiVx8t7qzfjSUk0mbK.html
07-05-2020||Noida||21 labourers booked for trying to go to Bihar amid lockdown||As many as 21 construction workers were booked by the Sector 24 police on Tuesday evening for trying to catch a bus to go back to their homes in Bihar. According to the labourers, there was a rumour going around that there would be buses available to take them home.The incident was reported from the Morna bus stand around 6pm when nearly 100 daily wage earners gathered in hopes to catch buses to their home towns.“I got a message from another worker who said that we could get a ride back home on buses from here. Even our contractor had heard the rumour about the buses leaving. But when we got here, the police told us that the buses were only for students and there was nothing for us at the moment... Most of us are from Bihar,” said Raj Nihal, a construction worker living at a site in Sector 34 who belongs to Muzaffarpur.The labourers said that they have been stuck in Noida for more than a month now without work and wages, relying on the generosity of the public for essentials.After the crowd gathered, the police tried to disperse most of them but a few gathered at the Morna police post and started creating a ruckus after which more police intervened.“Most of the labourers left after it became clear that there were no buses. But, 21 people were booked under Section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code for violating the guidelines of the lockdown. They were later released after being granted interim bail and were asked to go back to their dwellings,” Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police, zone 1, said.The police said that when buses do ply for migrants, the information will be shared with them. However, Tuesday’s incident was based on a rumour that circulated among the workers.“We are investigating the matter to trace the source of the rumour. Due legal action will be taken once the individual(s) is identified,” said the ACP.This is not the first incident wherein migrants have been desperate to leave the city to go back home. On May 1, 36 migrants from Bihar who live in Sector 8 had been booked by the Noida police for attempting to leave the district in a mini-truck.A nationwide lockdown had been first announced on March 24 after which the country witnessed massive migrant movement on its way home in light of lack of work and resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/21-labourers-booked-for-trying-to-go-to-bihar-amid-lockdown/story-1QuzeNK510LTolgcB5r3iL.html

However, he denied the allegation and said that he was attacked by some people at the Wazirabad vegetable market, Sector 52, and when he approached the Sector 56 police station to file a complaint, he was informed that the area was not under their jurisdiction and he should contact Sector 53 police station instead.The police are investigating the matter and a case against Dr Pradeep Sharma, the civil surgeon, will be registered. The incident took place on Sunday afternoon when Dr Sharma had come to Gurugram to visit his son.He said, “I had gone to Wazirabad vegetable market to buy some vegetables for my son. I accidentally forgot to wear a mask. When some people saw me, they attacked me with a stick and pushed me. I immediately contacted the SHO of the Sector 56 police station but he did not help me. I was able to escape the spot and return home. In the evening, I then went to the Sector 56 police station to talk to the officer.”A statement given by Sumit Kumar, SHO, Sector 56 police station, read that the civil surgeon called him on the phone regarding the alleged brawl at the vegetable market. “I informed him that the Wazirabad vegetable market is under the jurisdiction of the Sector 53 police station and offered to give him the phone number of the SHO concerned. However, he began speaking in a loud voice and threatened me. I did not want to argue and hung up. Later, I sent him the number of the SHO concerned.”The police said that in the evening, the civil surgeon allegedly arrived at the Sector 56 police station.“He came to the police station and misbehaved with the personnel. He claimed to know senior officials and threatened to get us suspended. I recorded the incident on my mobile phone,” the SHO added. The police said that senior officers are investigating the matter and a case will be registered against the civil surgeon.Dr Sharma said, “They are trying to implicate me in a fake case. I have already given a complaint to the Sector 53 police station regarding the incident that took place at the Wazirabad vegetable market. However, I am yet to receive a copy of the FIR.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/medical-professional-asks-cops-for-help-cops-allege-he-misbehaved/story-dZiZKGDD26w6uAk2Yn9gMO.html
07-05-2020||Gurugram||At 104, orange zone Gurugram has the highest number of cases in Haryana||With 17 more confirmed positive for the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19)—the highest single day spike yet—Gurugram district’s tally touched 104 on Wednesday. Of these 10 are vegetable sellers of Khandsa Mandi, with links to Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi hot spot, four from Dundahera, a declared containment zone, and three health care workers from a city-based hospital, who were in contact with other Covid patients.Khandsa Mandi, the wholesale fruit and vegetables market of Gurugram, will remain shut till May 8. Total cases from here on Wednesday touched 19—highest from any area of the city.Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, said, “We have reported the highest spike in Covid-19 cases today (Wednesday). While 10 are vegetable sellers, who had links with Azadpur Mandi, four cases from Dundahera are from the same building where six Covid-19 cases were reported last week. Also, three health care workers of a private hospital on Railway Road contracted the virus after coming in contact with a driver working with the referral ambulance service in Delhi; he had tested positive on Sunday.”Gurugram, despite being an orange zone, now has the highest number of cases in the entire state, much more than the other affected district—Sonepat (81), Faridabad (78) and Jhajjar (70).INTENSIFYING TARGETED SAMPLINGHealth department officials said spike in Covid-19 cases is due to intensified targeted sampling which is being conducted to control the spillover of infection coming from Delhi, which has third highest number of Covid cases in the country. “We were cautious after positive cases surfaced in Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi as many traders visit it regularly. We must also remember that there are a lot of frontline workers, such as police personnel and health staff, who work in Delhi but live here. Contact tracing becomes crucial in areas where density of population is high, especially in districts like Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat, Panipat and parts of Panchkula,” additional chief secretary (health) Rajeev Arora said, adding that these cases are mostly asymptomatic and pose a greater threat than symptomatic cases.In case of Khandsa, the health department did surveillance of more than 1,600 people and collected samples of over 128 vegetable sellers. The health team’s plan is to track hawkers who were in contact with the Covid-19 patients and to reach out in areas where they have sold vegetables. “Ward-wise, these hawkers will be traced. To detect if the infection has spread random sampling will be done. If positive cases are found, then containment strategy will be prepared,” said Dr Punia. Arora, on the other hand, said the state government has decided to increase the base for targeted sampling. “We will now cover ration depot holders, people who are involved in the task of procuring food grains as this activity has been going on continuously across the state,” he said.EXPECTING POTENTIAL CASESHealth experts called targeted sampling and testing an efficient approach in identifying emerging hot spots. “Targeted sampling is an appropriate use of resources to target areas for testing where high risk cases are likely to be concentrated,” said Dr Preeti Kumar, a public health systems expert and vice-president of Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI). “Targeted sampling and testing is done in areas where you expect a high yield of potential cases or to identify clustering of cases in or out of the containment zone or to study a silent area. It helps in understanding the distribution of disease in a community,” said Kumar.In Gurugram, Khandsa remained a silent area till targeted sampling was done after cases emerged in vegetable sellers in Delhi, Sonepat and Jhajjar.It is the fourth wave of targeted sampling in the state, said Dr Dhruv Chaudhary, nodal officer Covid-19 in Haryana. “First, it was for people with travel history to China, second for people coming from other western countries, third was people who attended the congregation in Delhi and fourth are people with essential services jobs in Delhi, a place which is experiencing community spread.”According to him, the purpose behind targeted sampling is to prevent or delay the community spread of Covid-19 by tracing asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases in affected district.Chaudhary said, “There are two strategies– targeted and random collection of samples – to detect infection spread in a community. Random sampling cannot be 100% correct so targeted sampling is an effective measure.”According to health officials, targeted sampling was the only way to break the chain of spread. According to Arora, intensive targeted testing was a key factor in breaking the chain of transmission in Nuh and Palwal when patients were traced in large numbers. “It helped us in containing the infection in the affected districts,” said Arora. In Nuh 59 cases have been reported till now, out of which only 6 are undergoing treatment, rest have recovered. Likewise, in Palwal 36 cases were reported, of which only four are hospitalised.INCREASING CASES CAUSE FOR ALARM? Arora said that the number of Covid patients might increase as they are proactively searching for potential cases in a community. Affirming Arora’s view, Kumar said, “Number of cases might increase in this strategy, but it should not lead to panic reaction. Sudden spurt will help in identifying high risk groups and building up the containment strategy.”But Kumar also cautioned that targeted sampling didn’t imply the district administration would be able to start doing mass testing in a population where population has remained asymptomatic for long. “Testing them gives no additional advantage. It may give a false assurance and may lead to people avoiding social distancing and hand washing–which are really the most key strategies for breaking the transmission,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/at-104-orange-zone-gurugram-has-the-highest-number-of-cases-in-haryana/story-5K8ciFDrK43zM6772tCNLL.html
07-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police questions Maulana Saad’s son in Tabhligi probe||The Delhi Police’s Crime Branch questioned the son of Maulana Saad, the Tablighi Jamaat chief, for two hours on Tuesday. He was questioned about Jamaat members, activities at their headquarters and office-bearers of the organisation.A senior officer, who did not wish to be named, said Saad’s son was particularly asked about the whereabouts of 20 people who worked at the Markaz in Nizamuddin area to look after the visitors. These people have been missing since cases pertaining to the gatherings were registered, the officer said.According to the police, Saad’s son is involved in the Jamaat activities and was hence, questioned.Shahid Ali, spokesperson for Tablighi Jamaat, said they welcome all investigations by the police. “We seek fair and impartial probe and therefore, expect Maulana Saad and others will be cleared of all charges,” Ali said.A criminal case was registered by the Delhi Police against Maulana Saad and six other senior officials of the Jamaat on March 31 for defying a series of government directives in the national capital, as cases linked to the Jamaat have been traced across the country.The Delhi Police did not respond to repeated texts and calls for comment.In an earlier interview to HT, the Tablighi chief had told through his lawyer that he is willing to cooperate with the police and that no illegal activity took place at the Markaz.JAMAAT ATTENDEES RELEASEThe Delhi government on Wednesday decided to release 4,000 persons, mostly those who had visited Tablighi Jamaat headquarters, from government-run quarantine facilities after they tested negative and completed 28 days of quarantine.The decision was taken by Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, as the Delhi government didn’t receive any response from the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) to their letters in this regard.“There was no response the MHA. The Delhi government has decided to allow them to return to their home states as they have recovered and completed more than the mandatory quarantine period,” said a senior Delhi government official, requesting anonymity.When contacted, an MHA spokesperson said they have not sent any communication to Delhi government on Tablighi Jamaat. Asked if MHA’s permission is required for the release, the spokesperson refused to comment. Of the 4,000 persons, 3,013 are those who were shifted from the Markaz and other mosques in the capital, while the rest are those they had come in contact with.According to a senior Delhi government official, those evacuated were sent to quarantine centres at Narela, Bakkarwala, Mandoli, Sultanpuri, Dwarka and Badarpur. Of this, 2,446 are Indian nationals, including 191 from Delhi, while 567 are foreign nationals.“For sending the foreign nationals to their home countries, there will be discussions with the Central government in the coming days. Those who want to return to other states can apply in the government scheme for helping stranded individuals reach their home states, which covers pilgrims. Those who have access to private vehicles can apply for inter-state passes,” the senior government official said.“Within the city, there is no restriction in movement from 7am to 7pm. They can stay with their relatives and friends. If they wish to stay continue staying in the quarantine facility, there is no restriction on that as well. Their quarantine period is over,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/police-questions-maulana-saad-s-son-in-tabhligi-probe/story-Hb9qEST5MEUoMuYJ7bElBP.html
07-05-2020||Delhi||Limit public transport capacity, maximise social distance: CRRI||The Central Road Research Institute’s (CSIR-CRRI) recommendations for the safe use of public transport, once the nationwide lockdown is lifted, include limiting the number of passengers in buses and separate gates for boarding and alighting Metro coaches.The guidelines, to be shared with all state governments and ministries in the central government, also propose creating a partition between the driver’s seat and the back seat in taxis using a plastic sheet, a dynamic display showing the number of available seats in Metro trains and buses, and earmarking the waiting area in stations, among others. The guidelines also propose painting additional zebra crossings at each intersection to ensure pedestrians crossing on to opposite sides do not come in contact with each other.Transport experts at CSIR-CRRI say these moves will help manage crowds, ensure the presence adequate transport infrastructure to discourage people from using private vehicles, encourage pedestrians and cyclists to ensure social distancing.Experts recommend a social distance of at least six feet between people, as well as reducing physical contact, to minimise the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Satish Chandra, director CSIR-CRRI, said, “The biggest challenge is crowd management in public transport so that social distancing is effectively implemented. As only 50% occupancy is allowed in public transport currently, there is a need to immediately enhance the capacity and also manage the demand by ensuring staggered office timings.”If this is not done, Chandra said, a lot of public transport users might switch to private vehicles to protect themselves from contracting Covid-19.Public transport services have been shut in the national capital since March 23, two days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19.Officials said the Delhi government is working a plan to ensure social distancing in public transport once the lockdown is lifted and public transport resumes.“We are working on a plan to decide how we will reopen public transport. We will also have to work out a plan to sanitise public transport,” a senior Delhi transport official said.Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday said public transport may resume soon, and that the Central government was formulating guidelines for the same.Officials of the Delhi Metro, the Capital’s transport lifeline, said the organisation would follow guidelines framed by the Union and state governments.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, “We will follow all guidelines set by the government while framing advisories for passengers. Additionally, models adopted by metro systems across the world are also being studied to ensure that the resumption of services is smooth, convenient and safe for Delhi Metro’s commuters.”With schools shut and inter-state movement banned, experts said a lot of private buses, including chartered buses, are currently unused. “These buses can be made part of the public transport system to help meet the increase in demand, ensure quality by observing social distancing measures, and discourage people from shifting to private vehicles. Staggered office timings and better work-from-home norms will also be helpful,” said E Madhu, head, transport planning division, CSIR-CRRI.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director transport at the Centre for Science and Environment, said Delhi could easily induct the unused buses into its public transport fleet.“The Delhi government has used private buses during the odd-even scheme. They just have to build on it. Though these are testing times, it is an opportunity to address the issue of overcrowding in public transport,” Roychowdhury said.“Pre-booking travel time slots in buses and Metros will help manage crowds,” Madhu said.The guidelines recommend that the existing seating arrangements be changed in e-rickshaws, which are an essential part of the city’s last-mile connectivity mechanism. The CRRI recommends that e-rickshaw passengers not face each other and that the number of people who travel together in one vehicle be limited.To reduce the load on public transport systems, the guidelines suggest short trips be encouraged and infrastructure provided for cycle-rickshaws, e-rickshaws, bicycles and pedestrians.Rowchowdhury asked that plans be prepared to improve local infrastructure for travel over short distances. “With bollards and paint, we can create more space for pedestrians on the road and ensure their safety. People can make these trips either by walking or cycling. This will bring down the load on public transport.”Experts also pointed to innovative public transport systems other countries had adopted.Amit Bhatt, director transport, WRI India, said, “Bogota, the capital of Colombia, has converted 100km of streets into cycle lanes to reduce the load on its bus systems. Mexico City is planning to quadruple its cycle network to reduce the pressure on its metro. Budapest, the capital of Hungary, is creating cycle lanes as a safe alternative for the commute as the city has seen a 90% drop in public transport use,” Bhatt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/crri-guidelines-for-public-transport-include-separate-boarding-and-alighting-gates-in-metro/story-N8iLlVW7IIuDY8tqTqPTtO.html
07-05-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 update: At Delhi airport, repatriated Indians to be screened, split into groups||Stranded Indians who are to be evacuated from other countries and flown to New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport will be screened and primarily be divided in three categories — those with Covid-like symptoms, those who have been in touch Covid patients and asymptomatic people.People with symptoms of the infectious disease will be straightaway sent to hospitals, while those who have been in touch with Covid-19 patients will be sent to quarantine facilities. The rest will be asked to fill out a declaration form and to quarantine themselves at home.The Delhi government on Wednesday passed an order defining the setting standard operating procedures for the movement of such repatriated passengers at the Delhi airport. The passports of those sent to home quarantine will only be returned at the airport, the order said.The order said the passengers will be escorted out of the plane by airline staff using dedicated aerobridges and will arrive at the APHO health counters for initial thermal screening. Here, symptomatic passengers will be isolated and moved to designated hospitals. The staff present inside the aircraft and those on the ground will ensure that arriving passengers have filled their self-reporting forms (SRF) properly.“After screening, the asymptomatic passengers will be allowed to move to dedicated immigration counters with their passports and a copy of their filled up SRFs. After clearance, their passports shall be retained by the immigration officials and the passengers will be handed over to a five member escort team (headed by CISF and comprising representative from DIAL, the respective airlines and Delhi Police) in batches of 30. The passports of these passengers will be handed over by the immigration staff to the CISF officer leading the escort team,” the order saidIt mentioned that the passports shall not be handed over to passengers in any case.Passengers will then be taken to the conveyor belts. “If there is any delayed or missing luggage, the respective passenger shall stay behind along with a team member while the rest shall proceed to the customs area and move to the triage area manned by Delhi government officials,” said the order.At the designated triage area, there would be five screening counters manned by medical officers and paramedical staff deputed by Delhi government. “At the assigned counter, the passports of the entire batch will be handed over by the CISF team leader to the medical officer in-charge of the counter. Passengers will be screened and those without any risk factors will be sent for home quarantine after providing them their passports. A declaration will be collected from them stating that they will remain strictly under home quarantine, or face penal action, as per rules,” the order said.It said, these passengers will be linked to the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) and that the government will depute a Delhi State IDSP team for this purpose.“The remaining high-risk passengers will be sent to various quarantine facilities. They too will be first asked to fill up a declaration where they will be asked to choose between a paid or government quarantine facility (based on availability). The escort team will then move these passengers to the transport provided by the state government to be taken to their designated quarantine facilities,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-draws-up-rules-for-citizens-being-repatriated-from-other-countries/story-f1I0mdhuCUtd0qTfcyoqKL.html
07-05-2020||Chandigarh||Banks can now apply for stamp papers online in Chandigarh||Society for Promotion of Information Technology (SPIC) launched an online application, exclusively for scheduled banks to apply online for issuance of stamp paper from sampark centres, on Wednesday.“This application will reduce face-to-face interaction at sampark centres to the minimum and make the process for issuance of stamp papers less cumbersome,” a senior UT official said.With the launch of this facility, banks can now apply online on sampark portal www.sampark.nic.in, for stamp papers of any denomination and also pay online as the application is integrated with payment aggregator. After applying and paying online, the designated sampark centre will accept the request of requisition bank for issuance of stamp papers, and print them as per details provided by bank(s).Once the stamp papers are printed, the message will be sent to the requisition bank to collect it from the designated sampark centre between 11am to 3pm.This service is exclusively for banks (for bulk purchase only) as they have huge requirements for high denomination stamp papers for their banking process and had to spend alot of time at sampark centres for filling the form manually, making payment and getting it printed, which is not advisable during the Covid -19 pandemic.If any organisations/institutes/companies/individual except bank apply for the stamp paper, it will be treated as a violation and no e- stamp will be issued and payment won’t be refunded.During filling of application form, it is advised to check all details carefully before submission. Once submitted, no correction can be made and sampark will not take responsibility for any spelling mistake/wrong name entered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/banks-can-now-apply-for-stamp-papers-online-in-chandigarh/story-mVVc86H5CSKCSmAU4vQMfO.html

Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL), which operates the Indira Gandhi International Airport, said since the nationwide lockdown began on March 25, evacuation flights to 58 destinations — 16 domestic and 44 international, operated out of Delhi Airport. “Around 27,500 foreign nationals and 2,300 Indians were evacuated during this period. Also, the airport handled the movement of over 12,600 metric tonnes of import and export cargo, including COVID-19 related medical essentials and fresh vegetables,” DIAL said in a statement. Over 500 personnel from DIAL’s operations, cargo, housekeeping, airport rescue and fire fighting (ARFF), apron control teams, in coordination with CISF, immigration, airlines, ground handling agencies, ATC and others have been working round-the-clock to make such functioning possible, the statement said. The airport has also created a dedicated medical distribution facility to process and distribute imported medical essentials to medical institutes and hospital across the country. The airport was also recently designated as the major hub for import and distribution of Covid-related medical essentials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-airport-handles-over-1-310-cargo-and-relief-flights-during-lockdown/story-fTvmDuxBQYTsXyPPNTeVBN.html
07-05-2020||Delhi||Traffic snarls return to Delhi, Covid-19 lockdown curbs take back seat||For 40 days, the Capital’s roads were empty. Cars remained parked, motorcycles sped away only when the police were not looking.But from Monday, rush hour was back in many areas as the lockdown norms, in place since March 25 to contain Covid-19, were considerably relaxed. Along with “Covid-19 hot spots” (all 11 districts) were now over a dozen “traffic hot spots” that the Delhi traffic police counted. Many commuters brazenly violated lockdown norms by overloading vehicles beyond the prescribed limit of passengers, and flouted traffic rules too. Traffic police assessment showed that in areas around Chirag Delhi, Akshardham, Rajouri Garden, Zakira, Karol Bagh, Patel Nagar, Uttam Nagar, Janakpuri, Kirti Nagar, Kondli, Ghazipur, Okhla and Seelampur, reported long traffic snarls during the peak morning and evening hours over the last three days. On Wednesday, traffic was slow moving in areas around Palam, Naraina, Vikaspuri, Mundka and Munirka (on the Outer Ring Road).The traffic department say the traffic at these areas were considerably more than what they had estimated after factoring in the relaxations -- government and private offices could resume work with 33% workforce, standalone shops, industrial units and in-situ construction were also allowed.“We knew traffic would increase since during the lockdown it had been nearly zero. However, it was more than what we had expected. Especially during office hours, we now need some officials at these areas to manage traffic flow,” said a senior traffic police official.The official said controlling movement, especially when the Capital is under the “Red Zone” where strict adherence is required to control the spread of Covid-19, was difficult because there was no way to ascertain if a person on the road was out for a genuine reason.ON THE GROUNDThe Delhi government order on May 3 relaxing the restrictions added there would be no public transport and private vehicles are required to adhere to passenger limits -- only driver and two passengers. To ensure social distancing, no pillion riders will be allowed on two-wheelers. However, when HT visited some of the police pickets in the city, people were found openly flouting this restriction.“If there is no picket to slow the vehicles they just zoom past us. Some plead that they be allowed to go this one time because there is no public transport,” said Dheeman Singh Yadav, a traffic constable stationed at east Delhi’s New Ashok Nagar.Policemen on the road also said they generally don’t stop vehicles with just the driver and a passenger to verify why they were out. Delhi police officials said that though there is no provision to book people under the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, because of the special nature of such times, violators were booked under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) (disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant), which carries a fine of ₹200 and a jail term of up to a month. Police are also slapping sections 269 and 270 of the IPC, which books them for the spread of the infection of any disease dangerous to life.“Action will be taken looking at the gravity of each violation. If anyone flouts the rules of the lockdown, they are not only risking their own lives, they are also putting the lives of others in danger. They are being prosecuted and action includes fines and even jail term,” said MS Randhawa, Delhi police spokesperson.Data provided by Delhi traffic police shows that during the lockdown period, between March 25 to May 3, 454,438 speeding challans were issued and 18 people lost their lives in 17 accidents. Since Monday, 12,098 fines have been issued for speeding and 4,987 fines have been issued for jumping the red-light.Traffic experts said that the relaxations should have been implemented in a phased manner with a proper plan for enforcement agencies to follow.“There should have been a mechanism in place to ensure that the vehicles that are out on the road are actually out to reach their offices and are not out without reason. The state government can ask private companies to give letters of authenticity to those employees who have started coming to work, which can be handed over to the policemen on duty,” said Dr Tribhuvan Jain, epidemiology and disease control expert, who is a consultant with the union government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/traffic-back-on-road-people-violate-lockdown-restrictions/story-1omfrKo1e3EtblHc9UNS1L.html
07-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi braces for surge in Covid-19 cases, but says it’s ready for it||District health officials are expecting a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases next week, arising from the thousands of people who have been defying social distancing norms, especially outside liquor stores since Monday -- throngs that are threatening to become a logistical nightmare for staff working on contact tracing. “The decision to open up the liquor stores was taken in haste. There was no proper planning or communication with government bodies and departments, leading to chaos and confusion on Monday. We were totally blank about which shops were being opened where— how were we to ensure adherence to social distancing norms? And, in the next two weeks, this will cause a lot of trouble because there is no way we will be able to trace who came in contact with whom at such stores,” a district administration official said on condition of anonymity.To be sure, the crowds were not unique to Delhi. Similar scenes were witnessed in other states too. Still, the crowding is likely to see a spike in cases in Delhi -- much like similar crowding in a vegetable market in Chennai caused the number of cases, on a downswing, to spike. “There will be an increase in the number of cases, that is the natural course of the infection. We have to see whether the relaxation of the lockdown will exacerbate it. However, Delhi is reasonably well prepared for around 1,000 cases a day for about 15 days at a stretch. Even if we assume that for every 500 cases, 10 to 12 will need ventilators, we have enough in the city. The actual numbers are lower,” said Dr SK Sarin, chair of the five-member team advising chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Covid-19 preparedness.To market, to marketMarketplaces have emerged as the source of several clusters of infection across the country even before the relaxations of lockdown norms. In Tamil Nadu, 300 of the 527 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Monday were traced back to one of the country’s largest vegetable and fruit wholesale market in Chennai’s Koyambedu area.In Delhi, 17 cases were reported from Azadpur Mandi, where the government has restricted the number of trucks coming in with goods, extended the market’s timings to ensure distancing, and has two teams of health care workers screening people.“Now, vegetable vendors in the city have also started testing positive — customers could have infected them or someone from the mandi. However, one thing is for sure, the numbers will go up as the norms are relaxed,” the district administration official added. Shortage of staffThe increase in cases expected over the next two weeks will pose a challenge for a team already fatigued by weeks of screening and contact tracing.“We have hundreds of other things to do. We were already tracing the contacts of positive cases, ensuring people follow through with their quarantine, screening and testing people from the community. Now, with positive people being allowed to be in quarantine at home, our staff will have to keep a check on them for the progression of symptoms. There are also hundreds of migrant workers coming in and leaving Delhi, who have to be screened and given passes. With liquor shops and markets opening, our staff will also have to ensure social distancing everywhere. How can this be done? There is no additional manpower,” a second district administration official said on condition of anonymity. “If 8-10 people test positive in each district and have come in contact with around 50 people, it is possible to trace them, but if suddenly there are 40-50 fresh cases in each district every day, this exercise will become impossible,” the first district official said.The government is making provisions for private services to check on positive patients under home isolation, a third district official said.“Currently, our teams call up everybody to check on them but we have been told that the government is in talks with some private agency to make the calls so that some of our staff is free for other work”..Hospital-based careDelhi has around 2,800 beds in government hospitals and another 420 in private hospitals for Covid-19 patients. Of the 3,572 people who are infected, 1,231 with moderate-to-severe symptoms are admitted to hospitals as on May 5. This means about 44% of the total bed capacity is being utilised.Lok Nayak hospital, with the highest capacity for Covid-19 patients, will add 500 more beds in the next few days, increasing the number of beds in government hospitals to around 3,300. “Another 500 beds will be added in the next few days, taking the total number of beds dedicated to Covid-19 patients to 2,000. We can handle any surge in the number of cases. Besides, we have observed that 80% of the people are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and can remain in isolation in their homes. So there shouldn’t be too much pressure on the hospitals,” Dr JC Passey, medical director, Lok Nayak hospital said.The Delhi government is also looking to purchase 500 more ventilators. There are 306 ventilators in government hospitals and around 800 in private ones in the city. There were 92 people in intensive care units and 17 on ventilators on Monday.The Delhi government also has a stock of about 50,000 personal protective equipment kits, with more expected this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/crowding-may-lead-to-surge-but-delhi-prepared-for-1-000-cases-a-day/story-BYR8gcNpTFPUG5qgM5ybLP.html
07-05-2020||Chandigarh||125 migrants to leave for Bihar in ‘Shramik Special’ train from Ambala||As many as 125 migrant labourers will be ferried to their native places in Bihar from the Ambala cantonment railway station in a ‘Shramik Special’ train on Thursday.The district administration held a meeting to ensure smooth running of the train that will leave for Kathiar district.Deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma said, “These migrant workers include those involved in agricultural activities. Arrangements have been accommodate labourers from Ambala and four to five neighbouring districts. Screening of passengers from other districts will be done as per criteria. They will be provided coach numbers and tickets with the help of RPF (Railway Protection Force).”“I have told the Ambala superintendent of police to ensure buses from other districts carrying labourers should enter the station directly. The health department will conduct a health check-up of all the workers including those from other districts. If any of them have symptoms of Covid-19, they will not be allowed to board the train,” Sharma said.Sources in the railway department said two special trains from Ambala Cantt to Katihar and Ambala Cantt to Bhagalpur will depart on Thursday and Friday, respectively, and two trains from Mohali to Hardoi on these two days.  Unwilling to divulge further details, railway officials said.“We want to avoid unnecessary influx of people other than those registered for travel by the state government,” Meanwhile, a few Congress workers led by local leader Renu Aggarwal handed over fruits to labourers travelling from Jalandhar to Bihar at the station on Tuesday. “We tried to reach on time, but missed out due to some confusion over departure time. But, we handed over the fruits and water to the GRP/RPF staff at the station. We have made arrangements for these items for labourers leaving on Thursday as well,” Aggarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/125-migrants-to-leave-for-bihar-in-shramik-special-train-from-ambala/story-IQi2L8ucKqNtG7tMd3iTWO.html
07-05-2020||Delhi||Summer break for Delhi govt schools from May 11 to June 30||Government and government-aided schools in the capital will shut for summer vacations from May 11 to June 30, the Delhi government announced on Wednesday. Officials in the education department said private schools in the capital, as usual, would decide the dates of their vacation.While regular classroom teaching has been suspended in schools since March 23 due to the Covid-19 lockdown, government and private schools continued lessons through web classes, texts and automated messages.The summer vacation schedule of government schools follows a similar to that of previous years. However, the education department has decided to suspend additional teaching-learning activities that used to take place in the school during the vacations, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“We used to conduct Mission Buniyaad classes and remedial classes during vacation, which won’t take place this time. So, we will be continuing all online classes and sending daily activities to students, through text and interactive voice response (IVR) calls,” said Binay Bhushan, director of education. Under Mission Buniyad initiative, schools hold special classes to improve learning levels of students.Bijesh Kumar Sharma, principal of Shaheed Hemu Kalani Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Lajpat Nagar, said, “The online classes were started to mitigate academic losses and hence, will continue. Besides, there should be something to engage children during the vacation to ensure social distancing measures are followed during this pandemic. In addition to the online classes, even the Spoken English project initiated for government school students will continue online.”Principals of private schools said they were waiting to finalise the dates for the vacation, as they expected the government could issue guidelines for summer vacation in private schools as well. Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said, “Usually, our vacation begins around May 19-20, but we haven’t decided upon the exact dates for the vacation since we were waiting for a government advisory on it. We are in talks with other principals as well and are likely to come out with the dates this week.” She added that her school would like to continue the online classes for students who will take board exams till May-end, at the least.Bharat Arora, general secretary of the Action Committee of unaided recognised private schools, said, “We have issued an advisory to continue online classes, in the interest of students, till May 22 in a phased manner. The vacation for preschool and nursery students could begin on May 11. For senior classes, online classes should continue till May 30. As far as reopening schools is concerned, it will be dependent on the prevailing condition during that time. Generally, classes resume in the last week of June or first week of July.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/summer-break-for-govt-schools-from-may-11-to-june-30/story-bhBzxZ2VWrTcE87zVSYnfN.html
07-05-2020||Delhi||Tokens, marshals to smoothen liquor sales in Delhi||In order to curb violations of social distancing norms, crowding and law and order issues during sale of liquor in the city, both the Delhi government and Delhi police enunciated several measures on Wednesday, including issuing tokens/coupons to the buyers and maintaining order in the queue with the help of barricades and marshals. As per the order issued on Wednesday, which HT has seen, the Delhi government has directed the departments incharge of government-owned liquor shops to take all measures to ensure people coming to buy booze do not violate rules in force to contain the spread of Covid-19.The Delhi Police, on the other hand, has suggested to the government to extend the timings of the sale, hiring of private volunteers for crowd control, if needed, and opening of private liquor shops – except those located in markets, malls and commercial complexes. Currently, the shops are allowed to open from 9 am to 6.30 pm.Thousands have lined up in serpentine queues since Monday when the government allowed sale of liquor in the city in conformity with the Centre’s guidelines relaxing the national lockdown. Only 172 government-owned shops have been allowed to operate. There are a total of 864 liquor shops in the capital. Police officials said on Wednesday only 80-90 shops were open and there were huge queues of buyers jostling for their turn. A senior police official said, “In the first two days, almost half the shops did not open or were shut within hours because of different reasons such as shortage of stock, fears of security or the possibility of a riot-like situation.”On Tuesday, the government recorded the sale of alcohol worth Rs 4.50 crore, excluding Rs 3.15 crore in special corona cess, a senior excise department official said. To beat the huge crowd at liquor shops, the Delhi government officials are also deliberating on the idea of home delivery – especially after several states including Punjab, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal launched web portals to enable home delivery. However, the police are yet to officially send any recommendations on the idea. “Currently, the Delhi Excise Act prohibits online sale of liquor, which effectively means that home delivery cannot be started unless the law is amended. However, these are extraordinary circumstances and laws like the Disaster Management Act can be invoked to make temporary provisions. The government has taken no call on the issue so far,” said a senior government official.Delhi has 864 liquor shops – of which, 475 are owned by government departments ranging from tourism to industrial and infrastructure development. The other 389 are owned by private individuals and enterprises.THE NEXT STEPSAnother senior government official said on Wednesday that the Delhi government has already asked the municipal corporations in the city to conduct a survey of “standalone” private liquor shops in areas under their jurisdiction. “Further call on allowing such shops would be taken only after the survey is over. A decision is likely to be taken soon,” said the official.“The police have given a go-ahead to the idea now,” said a senior police official.“The situation is improving with time but it will be better if private shops are also opened. This is one of the suggestions we have made to the district magistrates. The crowds have thinned after the special corona fee at 79% of MRP was imposed on liquor but people are still standing in queues that are several hundred meters long in several places,” the senior police officer said.Delhi police officers said that the local police have asked the management of the government-run liquor shops to hire private volunteers who will help them in maintaining social distancing.At places such as Ghazipur, Govindpuri and Uttam Nagar, volunteers have already been engaged to help manage the crowd. “Our message is clear. If people do not maintain social distancing, we will ask the district management to close the shops,” another Delhi police officer said.HOME DELIVERY OF LIQUOR: EXPERT SPEAKExperts say home delivery of liquor could help ease crowding at vends across Delhi.A former senior excise officer in Delhi told HT about how protocols for provision regarding home delivery of liquor in Delhi were first drafted by the excise department in 2002 but never materialised and it was in 2009 the excise rules rather prohibited any internet-based delivery system.“Currently, home delivery of liquor looks like the only and best way to ensure social distancing in liquor shops. Under the several drafts that were prepared between 2002 and 2009, the excise department had proposed engaging third-party agencies for the delivery service and also listed detailed plans pertaining to delivery services,” said the former official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tokens-extended-timings-marshals-among-measures-suggested-to-handle-crowd-at-liquor-shops/story-l23wEHa46IP5FIlZeCSuDN.html
07-05-2020||Delhi||Cop dies of coronavirus, first death in Delhi Police||A 31-year-old constable posted at the Bharat Nagar police station in north-west Delhi died of Covid-19 on Tuesday evening. This is the first coronavirus death among city police personnel. So far, at least three dozen personnel have tested positive for Covid-19.He had tested positive at a private lab, prior to his death and a sample from the corpse has been sent to a government lab for confirmation.“He was tested for Covid-19 by a private lab on Tuesday, before his death. The test result that arrived on Wednesday revealed that he was Covid-19 positive. We are awaiting the results from RML Hospital, which carried out a test after his death,” said a senior police officer.The constable was from Sonepat of Haryana, where his wife and three-year-old son live. He was posted at the Bharat Nagar police station and primarily worked with the crime records unit.“He lived with a friend in a rented flat on the fifth floor of a building in Gandhi Nagar, a neighbourhood close to Bharat Nagar. His duty did not involve active interaction with his colleagues or frequent visits to the police station. He did not live in the police barracks or eat in the common mess,” the senior officer said.Around 2am on Tuesday, he woke up from sleep and complained of breathing trouble. “His friend got him warm water to drink and inhale. When his condition did not improve, we took him to Dr Ambedkar Hospital in Rohini in the morning. He waited there for nearly three hours, but was neither admitted nor examined for Covid-19,” one of his colleagues, who did not wish to be named, said.A senior administrator of Ambedkar Hospital said that the question of Kumar’s admission to the hospital did not arise as it is a non-Covid hospital. He was then taken to the Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital by his colleagues. “Here, he was examined by doctors and given medication,” stated a brief statement released by the police before his test result arrived.He was taken to a testing centre in Ashok Vihar, where his sample was collected, and returned home. “In the evening, he again complained of discomfort upon which he was immediately sent to Lok Nayak Hospital, where he was declared brought dead,” the police statement said.On Wednesday, an audio clip, of a purported conversation among two personnel of the Bharat Nagar station, was circulated on WhatsApp. In the recording, one of the persons was heard saying that the police, despite leaving behind their families to do their duty, were not being cared for.HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the audio clip.Manish Agarwal, the joint commissioner of police (northern range), said that the Bharat Nagar police station in-charge had acted promptly on getting to know of the constable’s poor health. Agrawal said that the station house officer had decided he should be rushed to RML Hospital and had called up the hospital authorities, requesting that he is attended to.At the Bharat Nagar police station, meanwhile, the personnel have begun the process of tracing his contacts to get them tested and quarantine them. “While we believe he interacted with few staff members, we are following the standard operating procedure to trace his contacts,” said another officer.Delhi Police commissioner, SN Shrivastava, on Wednesday evening tweeted his condolences. “The sudden demise of late Constable Amit Kumar from PS Bharat Nagar has saddened the police fraternity. We stand by his family in this hour of grief and pray to the almighty to provide strength to bear this loss. All assistance to his family will be provided,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cop-dies-of-coronavirus-first-death-in-delhi-police/story-f7pJDGr7426bwbHEZk7MFM.html

What followed was a war of words between the district administration and the railways, as officials blamed each other for the lapse.The Ludhiana-Bareilly Shramik Special Express was to depart at 8am. For this, the administration had sent text messages to the shortlisted passengers around 10.30pm on Tuesday, asking them to report at their nearest pick-up points by 4am on Wednesday. As many as 1,200 migrants turned up at 28 pick-up points across the city, following which 50 buses ferried them to the Amar Shaheed Sukhdev Interstate Bus Terminal for medical screening before taking them to the railway station.However, amid sheer mismanagement, the screening took more than the anticipated time, not allowing buses to leave for the railway station in time. Consequently, the train was halted for hours till all migrants reached the station.The administration arranged medical screening at the railway station’s entry point as well to speed up the process. But, the train was suddenly signalled to leave at 10.55am, with three buses ferrying 60 migrants still waiting outside.An official from the administration deployed at the station intervened and contacted a railway official over the phone, questioning him why he was not intimated about the departure of the train, causing harassment to the passengers still in line. In return, the railway official blamed the administration for delaying the train’s departure by nearly three hours. Eventually, it was decided to accommodate the migrants left behind whenever the next train is planned to Bareilly.Deputy commissioner Pradeep Kumar Agrawal said the passengers will be contacted for the next train.TRAIN TO JHARKHAND ALSO DELAYED BY TWO HOURSAnxious moments were also palpable ahead of the departure of another train to Daltonganj in Jharkhand at 12pm, which was also delayed by over two hours.Waiting outside the railway station in their respective buses for hours, the passengers were allowed to walk in only around 11.30am.According to railways, 1,188 passengers left for Daltonganj in the train.With this, five special trains have left from Ludhiana and Jalandhar on Tuesday and Wednesday with 5,426 passengers in all.More such trains will run from Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Amritsar and Bathinda in the coming days.So far, over 10 lakh migrants stranded in the state have enrolled themselves on the Punjab helpline portal to return home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/60-migrants-in-ludhiana-narrowly-miss-train-to-bareilly-amid-mismanagement/story-XZw4VUotSql2fHtiV9UhKI.html

07-05-2020||Pune||Pool testing yet to start in Pune district; labs to increase testing capacity from 1k to 2k||Despite the state health minister declaring that the central health ministry has approved pool testing for Covid-19 samples, the district administration and the city labs are yet to take a call.Dr Anand Nandapurkar, nodal officer for Covid-19 for Pune district said, “We have not yet started pool testing for Pune. However, in a meeting with the administration and the laboratory representatives and virologists, it was suggested that if better equipment could be purchased for government labs like automated RNA extractor then the sample testing time could be reduced from six hours to one hour.”According to officials, although pool testing does increase the testing capacity by five times, it could also give false negatives if the viral load on the samples is low. To increase the testing capacity from the current 1,000 samples daily to about 2,000 samples per day, the district administration has instructed both private and government labs to increase their working capacity.With regards to pool testing, the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) advisory states that pooling of more than five samples is not recommended to avoid the effect of dilution which may lead to false negatives, especially in areas or population with positivity rates of more than five per cent for Covid-19, considering the higher possibility of missing positive samples with low viral load, except in research mode.“The administration has also directed labs to increase their testing capacity marginally which cumulatively can double the testing rate for the city,” said Dr Nandapukar.Currently, on an average, about 1,000 samples are being tested daily which is the maximum capacity for the 10 labs which test samples for Pune. The district administration has now directed the labs, both government and private, to increase the capacity to double the testing rate of the city from current 1,000 to 2,000.The civic body recently started collection centres at the red zones to ease sample collection and test as many contacts as possible.18,097 samples tested in the districtTill date about 18,097 samples have been tested in the district May 5. While the district is also recording a decline in the number of cases coming up daily, Pune city has shown a drastic fall in the number of cases in the past four days. As per the PMC health department, on May 1, there were 93 cases, on May 2 as many as 107 cases were reported and on May 3 there were 99 cases. On May 4, 61 cases were reported and May 5 there were 65 positive cases of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pool-testing-yet-to-start-in-pune-district-labs-to-increase-testing-capacity-from-1k-to-2k/story-gMeoBxxYTv9Vypus11B8VK.html

To this many of the doctors have strongly condemned this and have written to the India Medical Association (IMA) Pune.The notice issued by Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said that the civic body has observed that many private hospital and dispensaries were being kept closed. The commissioner ordered these hospitals and clinics to function normally failing which the PMC would be forced to file an FIR (first information report) under section 188 of Indian Penal Code, 1860.The notice stated that Maharashtra government under sections 2,3 and 4 of the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 had authorised the Municipal Commissioner “to take any prevention and containment measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 (coronavirus).”Dr Sanjay Patil, IMA (Pune) president , said, “PMC has sent a blanket notice to everyone without any verification, but internally, we are also verifying with our members. We will complete our verification by tonight (Wednesday night) and send in our findings to the PMC tomorrow. Meanwhile, we have verbally spoken to the commissioner about this.”“A number of doctors were angry with PMC for issuing the notice and raised the issue with the IMA apart from discussing it within their fraternity. A large number of the 4,800 members of the IMA had written to the association president,” Dr Patil said.They sought guidelines and protocols to be followed and also sought clarity on when they could resume elective surgery.Kataria Hospital wrote to the IMA stating that it was among the hospitals that was functioning throughout the lockdown with sanitisers, masks and social distancing measures.Dr Patil said that IMA had already followed all the rules and guidelines laid down by the government wherein doctors above the age of 60 years were exempted from working. “If we have husband and wife team of doctors, they have clarified that they have divided the clinic timings so as to manage their homes. Similarly, some doctors are following telemedicine queries hence their clinics are not open, while some have changed the timings of their clinic in accordance with the lockdown,” Dr Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-doctors-upset-with-sternly-worded-notice-from-pmc-asking-clinics-hospitals-to-be-kept-open/story-YGDHlaetwGb2fmqc6tSKwK.html

The order by Ram states that everyone from areas other than containment zones in Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and rest of the district will be given petrol and diesel by fuel stations between 7am and 7pm.Earlier on Tuesday evening, Ram had ordered that sale of petrol and diesel will only be to those involved in essential services.

Bhansali Productions and Eros International Media Limited had co-produced and released the movie in 2013 and there was an understanding between the two with regards to rights of the film. However, after one of the foreign companies started using the poster of the movie to highlight the merger, Bhansali Productions invoked the arbitration and conciliation clauses which restrained Eros International from selling, exploiting, licensing, distributing and renewing rights over the film. Bhansali also sought dues to the tune of Rs 19.39 lakhs to be paid by Eros.A single bench of justice B P Colabawalla while hearing the petition filed by Bhansali Productions through video conferencing on Monday was informed by senior counsel Zal Andhyarujina and advocates Nausher Kohli, Parag Khandhar and Nachiket Yagnik that Eros International limited was likely to merge with its parent company Eros International PLC and Hollywood’s STX Filmworks by June 30.Advocates Akshay Patil and Vikrant Zunjarrao representing Eros International opposed the plea and said that there was no urgency to grant interim reliefs to Bhansali productions as Eros was to bound to pay the dues.After hearing the submissions, justice Colabawalla said that as the respondent companies were situated in the British Isles and California it would require a detailed hearing to decide on whether reliefs can be granted against entities lying beyond the court’s jurisdiction. He further said that as the Court was hearing only extremely urgent matters there was no case for ad-interim reliefs. The court, however, directed Eros International to pay dues of Rs 19,39,241 to Bhansali production related to co-production arrangement within three weeks and allowed Bhansali Productions to approach it for reliefs against the merger after regular court resumed post lockdown.Meanwhile, Eros India spokesperson said, “The Bombay high court has adjourned the case in our favour. Eros always sticks to best corporate governance and business practices and had already given the cheque in advance as per our agreement. We will take appropriate legal action against Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s production for this mala fide and unfounded action, which has also been duly noted by the court”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-directs-eros-to-pay-19-3-lakh-to-bhansali-productions-in-3-weeks/story-sGKRZXSKdNb1yscbg43HEJ.html

The main concern of the growers this season is that the traders from other states who purchase at least 70% of their produce are reluctant to visit Punjab in view of the current situation. Traders from Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Madhaya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra come to Punjab every year to buy muskmelons and watermelons.The state government has announced 14-day mandatory quarantine for every person entering Punjab from other states.In Jalandhar district, muskmelons are grown over 6,700 acres and watermelons over 2375 acres. In Kapurthala, muskmelons and watermelons are grown over 4,200 and 1,000 acres, respectively. According to horticulture department officials, a melon farmer earns between ₹50,000 and ₹60,000 per acre on an average.Gurbhej Singh of Nihaluwal village of Jalandhar, who has grown muskmelons over 30 acres, said that due to several restrictions in the lockdown period, a majority of traders are avoiding inter-state visits.Resham Singh of Sheikhupura village in Kapurthala said these perishable crops can’t be stored for long and the government should make arrangements for timely sale of their produce. Kapurthala district potato growers association has submitted a memorandum to the horticulture department, urging the government to come forward to rescue melon growers. ASIA’S LARGEST MARKET Roopewal village in Shahkot subdivision of Jalandhar is considered Asia’s largest market of cucurbit crops, where traders from other states come to purchase musk melons and watermelons.Talking to HT over phone, Nadeem Khan, a trader from Rajasthan, said, “If I come to Punjab, I will end up spending major part of the season under quarantine period only.” Firoz Ahmed, a trader from Kashmir, said that they are still analysing the situation. Mishri Lal, a commission agent, at Rupewal market said various states must issue online passes to traders for inter-state travel so that they can buy the melon crop in Punjab.OFFICIALS FOR ONLINE TRADINGPunjab horticulture director Shailender Kaur said, “Traders have a long association with farmers. They can place online orders for melons which can be transported by farmers. Traders can transfer money in their bank accounts.”Kapurthala deputy commissioner Deepti Uppal also advocated online trading for muskmelons and watermelons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/melon-growers-worried-about-sale-of-crop-amid-corona-crisis/story-sd4EUQ6z0ANvQqt6zKkPNM.html

07-05-2020||World||Israeli Parliament passes bills for formation of Netanyahu-Gantz unity government||Israel’s Parliament on Thursday approved amendments to two basic laws by a hefty majority, paving the way for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to form a fully functioning unity government for the first time since December 2018.The Knesset or Parliament voted by 71 votes to 37 to back the power-sharing deal between Netanyahu’s Likud and his main rival former military chief Benny Gantz’s Blue and White parties.The bills were supported by the lawmakers in Netanyahu’s Center-Right bloc, except for the lawmakers of Yamina, who absented themselves, because it is still unknown whether it will enter the coalition. Blue and White and Labor lawmakers voted in favour, except for Labor lawmaker Merav Michaeli, who opposes the government, The Jerusalem Post reported. The bills were necessary for Blue and White to be able to recommend Prime Minister Netanyahu to form a government by Thursday night’s deadline to prevent a fourth election, the paper said. The party is gathering the signatures of its lawmakers, which together with 52 lawmakers in the Center-Right bloc will give Netanyahu more than the 61 he needs to submit to President Reuven Rivlin. The development came a day after Israeli High Court ruled on Wednesday that Netanyahu may form a new government while under indictment for corruption charges. In their ruling, the 11 justices said there was no legal cause to intervene in the coalition agreement between the two parties.The petitions against Netanyahu were filed by advocacy groups that have asked the court to ban any indicted politician, including Netanyahu, from being allowed to form a new government. Netanyahu, 70, was indicted earlier this year on charges of accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust. He has denied any wrongdoing. His trial was postponed due to restrictions his hand-picked interim justice minister placed on the courts after the coronavirus crisis erupted and is scheduled to commence later this month. Netanyahu had signed the agreement with Gantz to form a national government last month after an unprecedented third round of polls which again did not give anybody a clear verdict to form the government. The deal allows Netanyahu to serve the first 18 months as Prime Minister after which Gantz would assume power for the next 18 months. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest serving prime minister, has held onto power as a caretaker leader for more than a year as political stalemate prevented the creation of a government and triggered successive elections. His ruling Likud party emerged as the single largest party with 36 seats in the 120-member Knesset after the third round of polls but the right-wing bloc led by him could garner only 58 seats, falling short of the simple majority of 61. Gantz won the backing of 61 Knesset members and was mandated by President Rivlin to form the next government but he chose to cut a deal with Netanyahu, even at the cost of splitting his Blue and White party given the difficulties of putting together a government in a highly divided Israeli polity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-parliament-passes-bills-for-formation-of-netanyahu-gantz-unity-government/story-mEaCAgoSb6CebVGt1ctVzI.html

07-05-2020||World||UK to announce very limited easing of covid lockdown next week||Prime Minister Boris Johnson will announce a very limited easing of Britain’s coronavirus lockdown next week, adopting a cautious approach to ensure there is no second peak of infections that could further hurt the economy.Johnson is due to announce the next steps in Britain’s battle to tackle the novel coronavirus on Sunday following a review by ministers of the current measures that have all but shut the economy and kept millions at home.At a cabinet meeting of his top ministers, Johnson said Britain would advance “with maximum caution” and be guided by the science and data when considering whether any of the strict social distancing measures could be eased.“Any easement to the guidelines next week will be very limited,” his spokesman told reporters.“We are at a critical moment in the fight against the virus and we will not do anything which risks throwing away the efforts and sacrifices of the British public.”Ministers are concerned that a swift easing of the lockdown could lead to a second peak in infection rates, which might overwhelm hospitals and force the government to shut down the economy for a second time.Earlier, the Bank of England held off from further stimulus measures on Thursday but said it was ready to take more action to counter the country’s biggest economic slump in over 300 years, caused by the lockdown.Johnson briefed opposition leaders on the latest situation, with Labour leader Keir Starmer saying there needed to be a national consensus on the next steps in tackling the virus.“He also reiterated the seven principles that he wants the government to consider when planning for the next phase, including safety at work and preventing a cliff-edge to the job protection scheme,” Starmer’s spokesman said.Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the only change to the lockdown which had been floated in the media which she might agree to in the immediate future was the limit on people only exercising once a day.“I must make judgements informed by the evidence that are right and safe for Scotland,” Sturgeon, who will decide on whether to ease measures in Scotland, told reporters.“I will not be pressured into lifting restrictions prematurely before I am as certain as I can be that we will not be risking a resurgence of infection rates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-announce-very-limited-easing-of-covid-lockdown-next-week/story-oxyVpymxX6oKfDbrtw9p2I.html
07-05-2020||World||Trump administration asks court to not block work permits for some H-1B spouses||The Trump administration has urged a federal court not to block Obama-era work authorization for spouses of H-1B visa holders cleared for Green Cards, who are mostly from India, in a major departure from the US president’s push for securing American jobs for Americans.The Department of Homeland Security, which runs immigration among other things, told a court in Washington DC in a brief filed Tuesday that plaintiffs’ challenge to H-4 employment authorization document (H-1 EAD) that it causes them economic harm is speculative.“Plaintiff’s five-year old affidavits do not meet this demanding standard because they say nothing about the present job market or threat of impending economic harm,” the brief said as reported by Law360, arguing the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate how the rule caused job losses and how its revocation will help them.Save Jobs, the plaintiff, represents employees of a California public utility company who were laid off in 2014, as the company outsourced their jobs to Indian IT services companies Infosys and TCS that use H-1B workers from India.President Barack Obama authorized work permits for spouses of H-1B visa holders whose application for Green Cards had been cleared but who had to wait for their turn to actually be issued one. It can take years for Indians because there is a massive backlog of their applications, that gets higher every year because of the annual limit on the number of Green Cards that can be issued to applicants from any one country.More than 300,000 people in the Green Card queue are from India and the present laws are not changed, the waiting time for Indias could be as long as 150 years.The Trump administration has wanted to remove rescind the Obama-era rule but has not yet. The court has continued, meanwhile, starting in 2014, the year the rule was notified.Save Jobs’s challenge was thrown out in 2016 as the court concluded its members lacked standing, were not an affected party. That was a win for the Obama administration DHS.The court reversed the earlier ruling and said last November Save Jobs employees had standing. The plaintiff then sought an injunction blocking the rule. Affected H-1B visa holders India and a body representing them had argued against the injunction.And how this brief from DHS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-asks-court-to-not-block-work-permits-for-some-h-1b-spouses/story-WVhZGBDyFIZ188t9sLjNTP.html
07-05-2020||World||China faces risk of global ‘economic distancing’||Three countries and their relations in a post-Coronavirus world will determine which way global trading systems will sway in the future. China is one of them and is fighting with its back to the wall to keep its image untarnished as the other two -- Japan and United States - up the ante.The virus has definitely launched a be-wary-of-China campaign in most countries in Asia, Europe and certainly the United States.President Donald Trump has been succinct in provoking American industry to snap out of the Chinese production chains for American products.Other countries too joined the chorus. Several African countries protested the Chinese cover-up of the virus even as China aggressively pursued its global expansionist programs to Africa. Countries like Turkey cocked a snook by announcing that the antigen test kits imported from China were of inferior quality. It refused to distribute them among its citizens.Spain followed suit followed by the Netherlands returning ‘inferior quality” testing kits and face masks from China. Today it is about the quality of medical equipment from China.Kearney, the world’s influential consulting firm, released in early April its seventh annual Reshoring Index which said companies “will be compelled to go much further in rethinking their sourcing strategies, (and) their entire supply chains.” It was referring to American companies which the American media interpreted after the report’s release to mean that it is now time for these companies to leave China and re-assess their manufacturing.Forbes magazine, analysing the Kearney report, said: “The new SARS coronavirus has literally closed the economies of the Western world and created a public relations nightmare for China.”The magazine suspects the USA, which decades ago made China the hub of its manufacturing because of cheaper costs, is now looking at other south-east Asian countries including Vietnam, south-Asian countries like India and Mexico.Daily Wire, American political commentator Ben Shapiro’s right-wing news and opinion website, referred in a recent article to China’s bullying of the USA on the pharma front. To quote: ““In mid-March, Senator Marco Rubio told Fox News of an article in Xinhua, the Chinese state-run media agency, that stated: ‘‘If China retaliates against the United States at this time, in addition to announcing a travel ban on the United States, it will also announce strategic control over medical products and ban exports to the United States. Then the United States will be caught in the ocean of new coronaviruses”.Forbes put this quote in perspective in a celebrated article: “China is the go-to source for ibuprofen, hazmat suits, rubber gloves, surgical masks, ventilators... companies will want to hedge their supply chain strategy by spreading their risks. That doesn’t mean a full abandonment of China. It does mean China’s days as the go-to manufacturing hub for the Western world are over.”The trade war between the USA and China has deteriorated further after the Corona outbreak. China went into a lock down and its companies could not keep the supply lines to the US going. By March, factory closures became the norm. Supplies thus blocked, American businesses went dizzy. Then America itself went into a virus quarantine. Smarter, it is reconsidering shifting its supply bases abroad, specially from China.In Europe, the United Kingdom is leading the fight back against China’s corporate raider image. Amid the virus furore, UK parliamentarians opposed an attempt by a Chinese government-owned investment firm to install four directors in a British tech company that manufactures smartphone chips. The UK, like all of Europe, is wary of Chinese takeover plans of companies going under because of the Corona shut down. Here are some figures: China spent around $13 billion to acquire entities in Europe and another $25 billion in the USA.Reuters reported in mid-April: European Union’s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, told the Financial Times that member countries should buy stakes in companies to counter the threat of Chinese takeovers. Her comments “coming as the EU formulates plans to protect its businesses amid the coronavirus outbreak”.Unlike USA, Japan has already taken the initiative to get back the production bases of its companies from China. It has announced a $990 billion economic stimulus package that offers $2 billion to Japanese companies ready to shift base from China to Japan. The companies have not rejected the offer.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is in a bind. He is under pressure from severe right-wing groups to distance Japan from China. If that happens, it will undo everything the two countries assiduously nurtured over the last two decades.A recent Nikkei report said: ‘‘In Zhongnanhai, the area in central Beijing where leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the state government have their offices, “there are now serious concerns over foreign companies withdrawing from China,” a Chinese economic source said. “What has particularly been talked about is the clause in Japan’s emergency economic package that encourages (and funds) the re-establishment of supply chains.”Chinese President Xi Xinping was hitherto planning to use his first state visit to Japan in April - cancelled after the virus outbreak - as well as the Olympics in July - also cancelled - as an opportunity to close ranks with Japan at a time when its trade war with the United States was showing signs of affecting its domestic industry. Abe too was planning to silence his opposition by signing yet another development agreement with China.All that has come to a naught with economic survival becoming the buzz word.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-faces-risk-of-global-economic-distancing/story-C0lJTrbka6Tkf35tn0WIoK.html
07-05-2020||World||33 million have sought US unemployment aid since coronavirus hit||Nearly 3.2 million laid-off workers applied for unemployment benefits last week as the business shutdowns caused by the viral outbreak deepened the worst U.S. economic catastrophe in decades.Roughly 33.5 million people have now filed for jobless aid in the seven weeks since the coronavirus began forcing millions of companies to close their doors and slash their workforces. That is the equivalent of one in five Americans who had been employed back in February, when the unemployment rate had reached a 50-year low of just 3.5%.The Labor Department’s report Thursday suggests that layoffs, while still breathtakingly high, are steadily declining after sharp spikes in late March and early April. Initial claims for unemployment aid have now fallen for five straight weeks, from a peak of nearly 6.9 million during the week that ended March 28.Applications for jobless aid rose in just six states last week, including Maine, New Jersey, and Oklahoma, and declined in the 44 others.The report showed that 22.7 million people are now receiving unemployment aid — a rough measure of job losses since the shutdowns began. That figure lags a week behind the figures for first-time unemployment applications. And not everyone who applies for jobless aid is approved. The number of laid-off workers receiving aid is now equal to 15.5% of the workforce that’s eligible for unemployment benefits.Those figures are a rough proxy for the job losses and for the unemployment rate that will be released Friday, which will likely to be the worst since modern record-keeping began after World War II. The unemployment rate is forecast to reach 16%, the highest rate since the Great Depression, and economists estimate that 21 million jobs were lost last month. If so, it would mean that nearly all the job growth in the 11 years since the Great Recession ended has vanished in a single month.Even those stunning figures won’t fully capture the magnitude of the damage the coronavirus has inflicted on the job market. Many people who are still employed have had their hours reduced. Others have suffered pay cuts. Some who lost jobs in April and didn’t look for a new one in light of their bleak prospects won’t even be counted as unemployed. A broader measure — the proportion of adults with jobs — could hit a record low.The impact has fallen unevenly on the U.S. population, with Hispanics much more likely to suffer an economic hit. According to a survey in mid-April by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 61% of Hispanics said their household has lost income because of the coronavirus, whether through a layoff, reduced hours or pay cuts. That compares with 46% of blacks and 43% of whites who said so.Layoffs have also been more concentrated among the less-educated. Twenty-eight percent of Americans without college degrees say they’ve endured a layoff in their household, compared with 19% of people with college degrees.The official figures for jobless claims may also be under-counting layoffs. Surveys by academic economists and think tanks suggest that as many as 12 million workers who were laid off by mid-April did not file for unemployment benefits by then, either because they couldn’t navigate their state’s overwhelmed systems or they felt too discouraged to try.On Thursday, the government also reported how many self-employed, contractors and gig workers, who are newly eligible for jobless benefits, applied for them last week. Nearly 584,000 people did so. The government reported that figure separately because it isn’t adjusted for seasonal patterns, as the 3.2 million figure is.Economists are projecting that the gross domestic product — the broadest gauge of economic growth — is contracting in the current April-June quarter by a shocking 40% annual rate. As it does, more layoffs appear to be spreading beyond front-line industries like restaurants, hotels and retail stores.GE Aviation, for example, has said it is cutting up to 13,000 jobs. Uber will shed 3,700 positions. MGM Resorts International has announced that the furloughs of more than 60,000 employees could turn into layoffs.But the job cuts have hammered workers at restaurants, hotels and retail firms particularly hard. According to the payroll processor ADP, about half the total jobs in the hotel and restaurant industry — 8.6 million — disappeared in April, based on data from its corporate clients. A category that includes retail and shipping shed 3.4 million workers.The difference between the 30 million-plus unemployment claims that have been filed in the past several weeks and the expected April job loss of slightly more than 20 million reflects differences in how the figures are compiled.The government calculates job losses by surveying businesses and households. It’s a net figure that also counts the hiring that some companies, like Amazon and many grocery stores, have done. By contrast, the total jobless claims are a cumulative figure; they include applications for unemployment aid that began in mid-March.In addition, the government conducts its surveys for the monthly jobs reports in the middle of each month. So layoffs from the final two weeks of April won’t show up in Friday’s jobs report. They will instead be included in the May jobs report to be released in early June.After problems with state computer systems had slowed the distribution of federal benefits for many laid-off workers, all 50 states are now paying the $600 extra weekly benefit that the federal government included in a relief package enacted in late March. That represents a significant help to millions of laid-off workers, many of whom still remain anxious and uncertain.Jamie Stewart is renting out a spare bedroom in her home to try to make ends meets after losing her job at a southwest Florida resort. Having applied for unemployment benefits in late March, she finally received her first payment of $1,200 this week. Stewart, a 37-year-old resident of Bonita Springs, works as a concierge in the off-season and as a shift manager and bartender in the resort’s restaurants.After her layoff, she deferred her car payment for two months and cancelled non-necessities like Zoom, Pandora and Netflix. She recently signed up for food stamps, which cover about half her monthly grocery bill.“My mental health has deteriorated to a point that I don’t recognize myself anymore,” she said. “My eyes are swollen and bloodshot all the time now from regular moments of weakness that leave me completely inconsolable.“It looks like I have aged 10 years since the lockdown started.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/33-million-have-sought-us-unemployment-aid-since-coronavirus-hit/story-wUEeyXYPrquXhxFPS0igTO.html
07-05-2020||World||China lowers Covid risk for country as President Xi warns against complacency||President Xi Jinping has warned against complacency in the ongoing fight to curb the coronavirus outbreak in the country even as China on Thursday classified all its counties as “low-risk” for the Covid-19 disease.The decision to lower the risk level was taken as no domestic cases were reported in the Chinese mainland for four consecutive days as of Wednesday, and no new deaths for 22 consecutive days, national health commission (NHC) spokesperson, Mi Feng said on Thursday.The Chinese mainland reported two new imported Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, bringing the total number of imported cases to 1,680, Mi added.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageChina now has a total of 82885 confirmed cases of the disease and 4633 deaths from it.Xi, however, warned officials from “relaxing” in their fight against it despite the dramatic fall in numbers at a meeting of the Communist Party of China’s Standing Committee, the top decision-making body in the country, on Wednesday.“Xi stressed that authorities can afford zero complacency in their work on all fronts to consolidate the outcomes of epidemic containment, and must not undo all the efforts that have been made,” state media quoted him as saying at the meeting.Xi said the spread of the “…virus overseas has not been effectively curbed yet and cluster cases were reported in a few areas in China, posing considerable uncertainty to the epidemic control”.The epidemic prevention and control measures in Hubei, the Chinese province worst-hit by the coronavirus, should not be relaxed, Xi said.Meanwhile, China’s diplomatic spat with the US continued on Thursday with the Chinese foreign ministry accusing US secretary of state Mike Pompeo of telling one lie to cover up another in his continued attacks against Beijing over the pandemic.Speaking at the regular ministry briefing on Thursday, spokesperson Hua Chunying said Beijing has been transparent about the Covid-19 outbreak that emerged in Hubei province’s capital Wuhan late last year and that the US politicians were making baseless accusations against ChinaWashington has accused Beijing of covering up the outbreak and mishandling it.Hua added that China supported the efforts of the WHO to investigate the origin of the pandemic.“We are always open to cooperate with the WHO on matters, including on the question of origin,” she said.“While scientists have not come to a conclusion, why is Secretary Pompeo drawing the hasty conclusion that the virus came from a Wuhan lab? Where is his proof? Show us the proof. If he cannot show any evidence, then he may still be in the process of making up this evidence,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-lowers-covid-risk-for-country-as-president-xi-warns-against-complacency/story-c4hb5gIILHTsa6tID9mkDN.html
07-05-2020||World||UK economy faces deepest recession as PM Boris Johnson mulls ease in curbs||Battered on various fronts, the UK economy faces a 14% shrink this year, registering the deepest recession since 1706, the Bank of England said on Thursday, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepared to announce some easing of lockdown curbs from Monday.Presenting century-wise data on the size of the British economy since 1700, the apex bank, however, said growth could bounce back to 15% for 2021 as a whole, with GDP recovering to its pre-coronavirus peak by the second half of next year.Andrew Bailey, the bank’s governor, said he expected any permanent damage from the pandemic to be relatively small, since the economy was likely to recover “much more rapidly than the pull back from the global financial crisis” of 2008.“The scale of the shock and the measures necessary to protect public health mean a significant loss of economic output has been inevitable in the near term,” he said.Referring to wage subsidy schemes announced by chancellor Rishi Sunak for the employed and the self-employed, Bailey said the success of these schemes and the bank’s own stimulus meant there would be “limited scarring to the economy”.Johnson is due to address the nation at 7 pm on Sunday on easing some lockdown measures from Monday, with ministers keen to re-start the economy. The main message to ‘stay at home’ is likely to be withdrawn with limited allowances for travel and gatherings.Scotland and Wales have separately announced their approaches about easing the measures. The two UK constituents and Northern Ireland have the power to diverge from measures announced by London, but there are efforts that the easing is applied uniformly across the UK. Johnson was due to chair a meet on the issue on Thrusday.A new official analysis by the Office for National Statistics said the risk of death from coronavirus among Indian and other non-white groups in the UK is “significantly higher” than those of white ethnicity, complementing similar reports from other sources.It said that Indian and other non-white males are 4.2 times more likely to die from a Covid-19-related death and non-white females are 4.3 times more likely than white ethnicity males and females. The UK’s Indian-origin population is estimated to number 1.5 million.Meanwhile, health officials said 4 lakh surgical gowns imported from Turkey did not meet UK standards and were unusable, adding to growing concerns over shortage in personal protective equipment (PPE). In Nottingham, Indian-origin Labour MP Nadia Whittome was dismissed as a carer for the elderly when she raised the issue of lack of PPE.The Department of Health and Social Care said: “We are working night and day to source PPE internationally and domestically and brought together the NHS, industry and the armed forces to create a comprehensive PPE distribution network to deliver critical supplies to the frontline”.“All deliveries of PPE are checked to ensure the equipment meets the safety and quality standards our frontline staff need. If equipment does not meet our specifications or pass our quality assurance processes it is not distributed to the front line.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-economy-faces-deepest-recession-as-pm-boris-johnson-mulls-ease-in-curbs/story-LTdY6FLJ3bpfkRZUvmexGK.html
07-05-2020||World||China slams US after Trump virus ‘attack’ claim||China accused the United States on Thursday of trying to shift blame over the coronavirus, after President Donald Trump said the pandemic was a worse “attack” than Pearl Harbor or 9/11.Tension between the world’s two biggest economies has reached fever pitch in recent days as they have exchanged barbed comments on each other’s handling of the virus.“We urge the US side to stop shifting the blame to China and turn to facts,” said foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying at a press briefing.On Wednesday Trump drew analogies with the virus, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year, and infamous military and terrorist attacks on the United States. “This is really the worst attack we’ve ever had,” Trump told reporters. “This is worse than Pearl Harbor. This is worse than the World Trade Center.”The Japanese assault on the Pearl Harbor naval base in Hawaii drew the United States into World War II.The September 11, 2001 jihadist attacks on that killed about 3,000 people and triggered two decades of war.Trump said the coronavirus pandemic “should never have happened”.“Could have been stopped at the source. Could have been stopped in China,” he said.Hua responded: “They might say the pandemic is comparable to Pearl Harbor or 9/11, but the enemy facing the US is the novel coronavirus”.She said Washington should “fight side-by-side” with Beijing instead of as “enemies”.Hua added that “lots of foreign countries, experts and scientists have all made positive comments on China’s effective virus prevention and control.”“But the US alone has made some very disharmonious, untruthful and insincere remarks,” said Hua.The coronavirus, which first emerged in central China late last year, has now killed more than 73,000 people in the US.lxc-rox/lth/kma||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-slams-us-after-trump-virus-attack-claim/story-Ekdrzx2XjJtGJsarb1F88M.html
07-05-2020||World||Covid-19 transmission risk via sewage must not be neglected: Scientists||Environmental scientists have warned that the potential spread of Covid-19 via sewage “must not be neglected” since the viruses shed from the digestive system of infected individuals tend to last longer than those from the respiratory tract. The research, published in the journal Environmental International, noted that while response to pandemic is focused on preventing person-to-person transmission, the virus might also spread in wastewater. “It has recently been confirmed that the virus can also be found in human faeces -- up to 33 days after the patient has tested negative for the respiratory symptoms of Covid-19,” said Richard Quilliam, study co-author from the University of Stirling in Scotland. Based on their new findings, the scientists warned that the sewerage system itself may pose a transmission risk. They said the structural makeup of SARS-CoV-2, specifically its lipid envelope covering, suggests that it will behave differently in aqueous environments, compared to other viruses typically found in the intestine. There is currently limited information on the environmental persistence of Covid-19, but the study noted that other coronaviruses can remain viable in sewage for up to 14 days, depending on the environmental conditions. “It is not yet known whether the virus can be transmitted via the faecal-oral route, however, we know that viral shedding from the digestive system can last longer than shedding from the respiratory tract,” Qulliam said. Hence he said the fecal-oral route could be an important -- but as yet unquantified -- pathway for increased exposure. Quilliam said since most Covid-19 patients are asymptomatic or experience just mild symptoms and remain at home, there is significant risk of “widespread” distribution through sewers. According to the biologists, lack of testing “makes it difficult” to predict the scale of the potential spread and the public health implications of the virus arriving at wastewater treatment works. “The transport of coronaviruses in water could increase the potential for the virus to become aerosolised, particularly during the pumping of wastewater through sewerage systems, at the wastewater treatment works,” the scientists wrote in the study. According to the study, the risk of fecal-oral transmission could be further increased in parts of the world with high levels of open defecation, or where safely managed sanitation systems are limited. In these places, the scientists said waterways are used as both open sewers and sources of water for domestic purposes. “Such settings are commonly accompanied by poorly resourced and fragile healthcare systems, thus amplifying both exposure risk and potential mortality,” the researchers noted. Currently, all published data on faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 derive from hospitalised patients with limited information on mild and asymptomatic cases, they added. “In the immediate future, there needs to be an investment of resources to improve our understanding of the risks associated with faecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and whether this respiratory virus can be disseminated by enteric transmission,” the study concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-transmission-risk-via-sewage-must-not-be-neglected-scientists/story-WEAbcuxkodZL90cADtzZGN.html
07-05-2020||World||UK to review easing of coronavirus lockdown||The British government was on Thursday reviewing lockdown measures introduced to combat the coronavirus outbreak, with a partial easing expected to be announced this weekend.Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets Cabinet colleagues, with predictions that unlimited exercise and picnics will soon be allowed as part of the first step of easing restrictions.“We’ll want if we possibly can to get going with some of these measures on Monday. I think it would be a good thing if people had an idea of what is coming,” he said Wednesday.Pubs and cafes with gardens may also be allowed to open but people would be required to remain two metres (six feet) apart.But the government and its scientific advisers have warned not to expect a return to normality for months, with Britain’s mortality figures the highest in Europe.“The messaging will evolve from stay at home to be careful when you’re out,” an unnamed minister told the Daily Telegraph.Offices will have to stagger arrivals and separate staff with screens, while meetings will continue to take place remotely when possible, according to the paper.“In engineering, car manufacturing, textiles and construction, where social distancing can be implemented, then workers will be encouraged back to the factory floor,” a minister told the paper.- ‘Second spike’ -Britain has now recorded 30,076 deaths from coronavirus, the highest in Europe, although each country has a different method of recording its official toll.Broader data, however, puts the number at above 32,000.Johnson said last week that Britain had past the peak of the outbreak, the daily death toll was falling and the infection rate dropping below one -- meaning each person with the disease is passing it on to less than one person.But he also warned against the risk of a “second spike”, and hinted at a gradual rollback of restrictions.Schools will only open “when the time is right”, minister Robert Jenrick said Wednesday, with pupils studying for major exams expected to be the first to return. Families could also be allowed to see each other using “bubble” arrangements, the Telegraph said, under which people would meet with a small number of chosen friends and family.The system has already been floated by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who sits on the emergency contingencies committee that decides country-wide policies.The government has said testing will form a crucial plank of easing lockdown measures but is facing questions after failing to hit its 100,000 a day target for four days in a row.Johnson said on Wednesday that “capacity currently exceeds demand”, and set a new target of 200,000 a day “by the end of this month”.jwp/phz/wdb||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-review-easing-of-coronavirus-lockdown/story-UuEY8Ha84vrkMKgXVWXp3I.html
07-05-2020||World||Japan set to approve Gilead’s Remdesivir drug to treat virus||Japan is set to approve on Thursday the antiviral drug remdesivir for use against the novel coronavirus, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said.The rapid move by Japan’s usually conservative authorities comes days after the U.S. authorized Gilead Sciences Inc.’s drug for emergency use on virus patients. Special approval in Japan is reserved for urgent situations, where there is no alternative, and the drug has already been authorized for use overseas.Finding a treatment for Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, could move the world closer to easing lockdown measures put in place to help slow its spread. One early analysis showed that about two-thirds of severe Covid-19 cases improved when treated with the drug, according to a report published in April.Multiple trials of remdesivir are still under way. In April, the World Health Organization prematurely published results of a China trial by accident but retracted it soon after. The WHO post indicated that the drug didn’t show benefits in preventing death and reducing virus load, but the Chinese trial was halted early after researchers struggled to enroll patients.While the virus has so far wreaked less health damage in Japan than the U.S. or some European countries, the economy has taken a severe hit. Abe has said treatments and vaccines are needed to help restore economic and social activities.Typically, for a drug to be approved in Japan, the government requires clinical trials to include Japanese patients, or for a new trial to be done in Japan, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Caroline Stewart, who covers the pharmaceutical industry. While doubt remains over its efficacy, “it’s better than nothing,” she added.Health Minister Katsunobu Kato had said earlier in the week that the panel charged with deciding on remdesivir’s approval was to meet Thursday and that the process would be completed as soon as possible.Earlier this month, Japan’s Health Ministry said in a message to local governments that even if remdesivir is approved, supplies may be limited and will be controlled by the central government.More than 15,000 people have been confirmed as infected with the virus in Japan, and more than 500 have died, although experts say the relatively small number of tests conducted means there are probably more undetected cases.Japan has extended its nationwide state of emergency until May 31, with Abe saying the country’s coronavirus measures need more time to reduce infection rates.

07-05-2020||World||Former Vatican official Pell knew of child sex abuse for decades: Report||Cardinal George Pell was aware of child sexual abuse by Catholic clergy in Australia as far back as the 1970s and failed to seek the removal of accused priests, according to findings of a top-level inquiry released Thursday.The Royal Commission report was handed down in 2017 but pages relating to Pell’s conduct were heavily redacted to prevent jurors in his trials on child sex abuse allegations from being prejudiced.Australia’s High Court last month acquitted the former Vatican treasurer of all charges and freed him from jail, allowing the release of findings relating to Pell from the Royal Commission into institutional child sex abuse.The commission found that Pell, when he was a priest in the rural diocese of Ballarat in Victoria state, had begun considering in 1973 the “prudence” of now-jailed child sex abuser Gerald Ridsdale taking boys on overnight camping trips.“By this time, child sexual abuse was on his radar,” the commission said.“We are also satisfied that by 1973 Cardinal Pell was not only conscious of child sexual abuse by clergy but that he also had considered measures of avoiding situations which might provoke gossip about it.”The commission found it was “likely that he knew of Ridsdale’s sexual transgressions” when Pell joined a meeting about moving the priest to another parish in 1977.Pell, who lived with Ridsdale in 1973 and supported him at his first court appearance in 1993, has insisted he had no memory of claims of sustained mistreatment in Ballarat.The commission also found that Pell should have sought the removal of another priest, Father Peter Searson, after receiving a list of complaints from a delegation of teachers in 1989 when Pell was auxiliary bishop in Melbourne.‘Unpleasant, strange, aggressive’Searson was the subject of “numerous” complaints between the 1970s and 1990s including child sexual abuse and his “unpleasant, strange, aggressive and violent conduct”, the commission said.Though Pell conceded he could have been “a bit more pushy” in recommending a course of action to the archbishop, the commission found it had been “incumbent on Pell” to act in 1989 but he did not stand down Searson until 1997.Searson pleaded guilty that year to physically assaulting a child but was never charged with sexual abuse. He died in 2009.When the Royal Commission was announced in 2012, Pell -- then the archbishop of Sydney -- called the extent of abuse in the Catholic Church “exaggerated”.The inquiry heard that there were more than 4,000 alleged victims of paedophilia in religious institutions, and in some Catholic dioceses more than 15 percent of priests were perpetrators.Repeatedly questioned during hearings about the Ballarat diocese in the 1970s and 80s, Pell apologised on behalf of the church and did admit he “mucked up” in dealing with paedophile priests in the 1970s.However, he said he was deceived by senior clergy about what was happening during a time of “crimes and cover-ups”.Pell, 78, spent more than a year in prison after convicted in December 2018 of sexually abusing two choirboys in the 1990s when he was the archbishop of Melbourne. He had strenuously denied the charges and was later acquitted by the High Court in a second appeal against the conviction.However, Pell is still facing a civil suit brought by the father of one of choirboys, who died in 2014.“In my view, his position as Australia’s highest-ranking representative in the Catholic Church should be reviewed based on his choice to protect paedophiles over innocent children, at the time the abuse occurred,” said Lisa Flynn, the deceased man’s lawyer.In Good Faith Foundation, an abuse recovery group, said the report showed there were “numerous opportunities” for Pell to have acted throughout his time with the Church.“At each point he appeared to show more regard for trying to maintain a shroud of ignorance, than protecting the most vulnerable in our communities,” it said in a statement.“These findings ultimately highlight one simple fact: George Pell has always known more than he’s claimed and done less than he should have.”A spokeswoman for Pell and the Catholic diocese in Sydney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-vatican-official-pell-knew-of-child-sex-abuse-for-decades-report/story-WdRjK0cjqm8yqKSyLsL2pI.html

Punjab and Sindh, the two worst-hit provinces, have also announced some relaxation in lockdown by allowing reopening of few businesses like garment/cloth, shoes, automobile and spare parts.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

Some are monstrous like the one at our galaxy’s center 26,000 light years from Earth that is four million times the sun’s mass. Garden variety so-called stellar-mass black holes like the newly discovered one have the mass of a single star. This one probably began its life as a star up to 20 times the sun’s mass that collapsed into a black hole at the end of its relatively short lifespan. This triple system, called HR 6819, can be seen from Earth’s southern hemisphere with the naked eye, in the constellation Telescopium. Until now, the closest-known black hole was one perhaps three times further away.Only a few dozen stellar-mass black holes previously were known. But there may be hundreds of millions or even a billion of them in the Milky Way, said astrophysicist and study co-author Petr Hadrava of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.This black hole, detected using an observatory in Chile, is minding its manners and has not shredded its two partners: stars about five or six times the mass of the sun. At least not yet.“The formation of a black hole is a violent process, and most models would not have predicted a triple system could survive that but rather would fly apart,” Rivinius said.The black hole forms a pair with one of the two stars, as near to one another as the Earth is to the sun. The other star is much further away, orbiting the pair. This star spins so rapidly that it is misshapen, bulging at the equator.The two stars are sufficiently distant from the black hole that it is not pulling material from them. But in a few million years the closer star is expected to grow in size as part of its life cycle.“What happens then is uncertain,” Rivinius said. “The most spectacular outcome would be if the black hole ends up with that star inside it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/closest-black-hole-to-earth-has-two-partners-in-surprising-celestial-marriage/story-u70GTTq77WaxhwMGMYIZQM.html

China on Thursday downgraded Covid-19 risk levels in all regions, signalling its successful containment.Addressing a meeting of the central guiding group for novel coronavirus prevention and control on Thursday, Xi said the spread of the virus overseas has not been effectively curbed yet and cluster cases were reported in a few areas in China, posing considerable uncertainty to the epidemic control.“The country must get ready for unprecedented external adversity and challenges in the long run over Covid-19 crisis,” the Chinese President said.“The epidemic prevention and control measures in Hubei should not be relaxed,” he added.China has already reduced risk levels in Hubei province and its capital Wuhan - the epicentres of the virus, while business and factories across the country have resumed operations.China’s National Health Commission (NHC) on Thursday said that two imported cases were detected, and there was no domestically transmitted Covid-19 case.Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, which were free from new coronavirus cases for the last 33 days, reported six asymptomatic cases on Wednesday, taking the total number of such patients in the province to 626, the local health commission said.The total number of asymptomatic patients in the country now stands at 880.Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested Covid-19 positive but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. However, they pose a risk of spreading the disease to others.The total number of COVID-19 cases in China now stands at 82,885, the NHC said.Last month, China had announced to hold its annual Parliament session from May 22, signalling that the pandemic which paralysed the country for over three months is finally under control.The session was earlier scheduled to be held from March 5 and got postponed for the first time due to the coronavirus outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-china-lowers-covid-19-risk-level-president-xi-jinping-says-don-t-be-complacent/story-TvxMaj03GVDOFS19COwSbO.html

The city hopes closure will encourage them to find alternative shelter, but many advocacy groups have warned it will worsen the homeless crisis.‘Giant vectors of this virus’Witnessing the deserted subway stations leaves Will Ramos, a plumber and handyman, mourning the loss of “culture within the stations.”“You meet a lot of talent down here,” the 33-year-old said at the Union Square station, one of the network’s largest.But the pandemic has transformed the underground into “giant vectors of this virus,” in the words of conductor Sujatha Gidla, who contracted the COVID-19 illness.In a scathing open letter published this week in The New York Times, Gidla denounced precautions taken to protect MTA workers as too little too late, saying “essential” staff were treated as “expendable.”According to the MTA’s president Patrick Foye, 109 of 50,000 workers have died after contracting the virus.The subway system -- much of it devastated by Superstorm Sandy in 2012 -- was already undergoing costly renovations, a project deemed urgent after years of negligence.Now experts estimate the transit authority could lose $4-8 billion due to the pandemic. Both the city and state of New York have seen tax revenues in free fall as the economy stalls and unemployment soars -- and few expect Donald Trump’s White House to take pity on the transportation system of his home city.“The funding challenge will be huge,” said Bruce Schaller, the former deputy commissionner for traffic and planning at city’s transportation department.“It is very daunting.”But the public transit consultant doesn’t doubt the subway will weather the storm.In the 1970s the transportation network was in dire condition, wracked with crime. But Schaller says the city is far from that situation, when the city “as a whole was badly ailing.”Today, the question is “not about the longer-term vitality” for the subway, but about getting through the pandemic, he said.And emerging is vital, according to Schaller: “The fundamental assumption in New York is that you have mass transit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-s-lifeline-subway-halts-24-hour-service/story-AyZtzXuojSw9OEJ6t8cm3O.html
07-05-2020||World||India expected to have highest births since Covid declared as pandemic: Report||India is projected to record the highest number of births in the 9 months since Covid-19 was declared a pandemic in March, with more than 20 million babies expected to be born in the country between March and December, according to a top UN body. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) warned that pregnant mothers and babies born during the pandemic across the world were threatened by strained health systems and disruptions in services.An estimated 116 million babies will be born under the shadow of Covid-19 pandemic, UNICEF said on Wednesday, ahead of Mother’s Day, observed on May 10.These babies are projected to be born up to 40 weeks after Covid-19 was recognised as a pandemic on March 11.The highest numbers of births in the 9 months since the pandemic was declared are expected to occur in India, where 20.1 million babies are projected to be born between March 11 and December 16. Other countries with the expected highest numbers of births during this period are China (13.5 million), Nigeria (6.4 million), Pakistan (5 million) and Indonesia (4 million), it said.“Most of these countries had high neonatal mortality rates even before the pandemic and may see these levels increase with Covid-19 conditions,” UNICEF said. It is estimated that there will be 24.1 million births in India for the January-December 2020 period. UNICEF warned that Covid-19 containment measures can disrupt life-saving health services such as childbirth care, putting millions of pregnant mothers and their babies at great risk. Even wealthier countries are affected by this crisis. In the US, the sixth highest country in terms of expected number of births, over 3.3 million babies are projected to be born between March 11 and December 16. “New mothers and newborns will be greeted by harsh realities,” UNICEF said, adding they include global containment measures such as lockdowns and curfews; health centres overwhelmed with response efforts; supply and equipment shortages; and a lack of sufficient skilled birth attendants as health workers, including midwives, are redeployed to treat Covid-19 patients.“Millions of mothers all over the world embarked on a journey of parenthood in the world as it was. They now must prepare to bring a life into the world as it has become – a world where expecting mothers are afraid to go to health centres for fear of getting infected, or missing out on emergency care due to strained health services and lockdowns,” UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said. “It is hard to imagine how much the coronavirus pandemic has recast motherhood” Fore said.UNICEF said its analysis was based on data from World Population Prospects 2019 of the UN Population Division. An average full-term pregnancy typically lasts a complete 9 months, or 39 to 40 weeks. For the purposes of this estimate, the number of births for a 40-week period in 2020 was calculated. The 40-week period of March 11 to December 16 is used in this estimate based upon the WHO’s March 11 assessment that Covid-19 can be characterised as a pandemic. UNICEF warned that although evidence suggests that pregnant mothers are not more affected by Covid-19 than others, countries need to ensure they still have access to antenatal, delivery and postnatal services. Similarly, sick newborns need emergency services as they are at high risk of death. New families require support to start breastfeeding, and to get medicines, vaccines and nutrition to keep their babies healthy, it said.“This is a particularly poignant Mother’s Day, as many families have been forced apart during the coronavirus pandemic, but it is also a time for unity, a time to bring everyone together in solidarity. We can help save lives by making sure that every pregnant mother receives the support she needs to give birth safely in the months to come,” Fore said. Issuing an urgent appeal to governments and health care providers to save lives in the coming months, UNICEF said efforts must be made to help pregnant women receive antenatal checkups, skilled delivery care, postnatal care services, and care related to Covid-19 as needed.Ensure health workers are provided with the necessary personal protective equipment and get priority testing and vaccination once a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available so that can deliver high quality care to all pregnant women and newborn babies during the pandemic, it said. While it is not yet known whether the virus is transmitted from a mother to her baby during pregnancy and delivery, UNICEF advised all pregnant women to follow precautions to protect themselves from exposure to the virus.Closely monitor themselves for symptoms of Covid-19 and seek advice from the nearest designated facility if they have concerns or experience symptoms. Pregnant women should also take the same precautions to avoid COVID -19 infection as other people: practice physical distancing, avoid physical gatherings and use online health services, it said. UNICEF said even before Covid-19 pandemic, an estimated 2.8 million pregnant women and newborns died every year, or 1 every 11 seconds, mostly of preventable causes. The agency called for immediate investment in health workers with the right training, who are equipped with the right medicines to ensure every mother and newborn is cared for by a safe pair of hands to prevent and treat complications during pregnancy, delivery and birth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-expected-to-have-highest-births-since-covid-declared-as-pandemic-report/story-cjceKCa9f6O4AYeNC24e0L.html

Bats appeared to be the “reservoir” for the virus, but an intermediate host could not be determined, the report said.Talk of a new mission comes as debate grows over the source of the outbreak, which was first identified in Wuhan, China, more than four months ago. US President Donald Trump‘s administration has said the virus likely escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which runs a laboratory that studies dangerous pathogens. Some intelligence agencies are casting doubt on that theory, and China has repeatedly denied the claim.The WHO has come under fire from Trump, who has moved to cut off funding to the Geneva-based United Nations agency, saying it was overly deferential to China as the virus spread in that country and beyond. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo on Wednesday asserted that China covered up the origins of the virus even as he eased off earlier claims of “enormous evidence” that the virus escaped from a Wuhan laboratory.Pompeo repeated the US allegation that China is still refusing to share virus samples or details about the start of the pandemic and on “patient zero,” the first victim. And he said other countries are starting to see it the US way.“Our truth-telling and calls for transparency aren’t about politics, it’s not about bullying, it’s not about blame,” Pompeo said. “It’s about the ongoing need to save American lives. This is an ongoing threat.”China’s foreign ministry didn’t immediately reply to questions about the WHO’s proposed mission. On Wednesday, in response to calls from the likes of Australia and the European Union for investigations into how the previously unknown pathogen made the jump from animals to humans, ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that China would support a review about the origins of the virus at an “appropriate time.”“We will continue supporting the WHO and support looking back and summarizing the experience at an appropriate time to support global health cooperation and so we can better deal with pandemics like this in the future,” Hua said at a briefing in Beijing. “What we oppose is the presumption of guilt under the pretext of an investigation, or using the epidemic for political purposes.”Hua also dismissed Pompeo’s claims the virus escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan.Xi Seeks Reform“Mr. Pompeo cannot present any evidence because he does not have any,” Hua said. “This matter should be handled by scientists and professionals instead of politicians out of their domestic political needs.”China has come under fire over its early handling of the virus, which has pushed the global economy toward recession as it spreads around the world. Authorities had reprimanded doctors including Li Wenliang, who later passed away, for sharing warnings about the coronavirus infection risk in WeChat groups in late December.President Xi Jinping called for reform of China’s disease control system at a meeting of the Politburo on Wednesday, an apparent acknowledgment of lapses in the nation’s response. The country’s top leaders agreed to boost epidemic monitoring and early-warning capabilities, revamp public health emergency laws and regulations and enhance the response to major epidemics, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/search-for-covid-19-origin-heats-up-as-who-seeks-mission-to-china/story-iXZGO74pctP8ryEotx5oFJ.html
07-05-2020||World||United Nations appeals for $4.7 billion dollars more to combat coronavirus||The United Nations on Thursday issued a new appeal for $4.7 billion in funding to “protect millions of lives and stem the spread of coronavirus in fragile countries.” The money is on top of the $2 billion the UN already called for when it launched its global humanitarian response plan on March 25. It has received about half of that money so far.“The most devastating and destabilizing effects” of the novel coronavirus pandemic “will be felt in the world’s poorest countries,” UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock said in the statement.“Unless we take action now, we should be prepared for a significant rise in conflict, hunger and poverty. The spectre of multiple famines looms,” he warned.The full $6.7 billion is expected to cover costs of the humanitarian response plan until December.It prioritizes some 20 countries, including several in conflict such as Afghanistan and Syria.The new call for donations came as nine more countries were added to the list: Benin, Djibouti, Liberia, Mozambique, Pakistan, Philippines, Sierra Leone, Togo and Zimbabwe. The funds are to be used to buy medical equipment to test and treat the sick, provide hand-washing stations, launch information campaigns and establish humanitarian airlifts to Africa, Asia and Latin America, according to the UN. It also aims to develop new programs to better combat food insecurity that is growing as a result of the economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. “Extraordinary measures are needed,” Lowcock stressed. “I urge donors to act in both solidarity and in self-interest and make their response proportionate to the scale of the problem we face,” he added, warning of a long-term boomerang effect if poor countries are neglected by rich countries.Covid-19 infections are expected to peak in the world’s poorest countries in the next three to six months, according to UN estimates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-nations-appeals-for-4-7-billion-dollars-more-to-combat-coronavirus/story-csHDewZI5qbw8BVXWfqLzI.html

One of Brazil’s leading newspapers, Estado de Sao Paulo, is suing to force their release, arguing the president’s health is a matter of public interest.A federal judge ruled in the newspaper’s favor Wednesday, rejecting the government’s appeal of an earlier ruling. Further appeals look likely, however.Bolsonaro has condemned the “hysteria” around Covid-19.He says social distancing measures are needlessly hurting the economy, and regularly flouts them himself, hitting the streets in Brasilia and working the crowd in close quarters at rallies by his supporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-prez-bolsonaro-s-spokesperson-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-GT62dQbluHPhyEPXMXNl6K.html
07-05-2020||World||Trump govt asks court not to block work permits to spouses of H-1B visa-holders||In a major development, the Trump administration has urged a federal district court not to block an Obama-era rule allowing certain categories of spouses of H-1B visa-holders to work in the United States.In a submission before the US District Court, District Washington this week, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) argued that the American technology workers, who had challenged the 2015 ruling on giving work permits to H-4 visa-holders, have not been irreparably harmed by such work authorisation.An H-4 visa is issued by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to the immediate family members (spouse and children under 21 years of age) of the H-1B visa-holders, most of whom are Indian IT professionals. It is normally issued to those who have already started the process of seeking employment-based lawful permanent resident status.Also Read: US eases norms, H-1B holders, Green Card applicants get 60-day grace periodThe DHS, in its submission on May 5, said the argument by Save Jobs USA on behalf of American technology workers “only speculates about potential economic harm to its members, based on five-year-old affidavits”.In its lawsuit filed in 2015, Save Jobs USA had argued that the regulation issued by the Obama administration to provide employment authorisation for certain H4 dependent spouses harms their members, who are American technology workers.After coming to power, the Trump administration in December 2017 informed the court that it plans to rescind the Obama-era regulations in this regard. Since then, it told the court about half-a-dozen times about its intention to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). However, the DHS has not rescinded “Employment Authorisation for Certain H-4 Dependent Spouses” of 2015.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe DHS’s court submission was in response to the one by Save Jobs USA, which sought a preliminary injunction to stop the H-4 rule from providing qualifying H-4 visa-holders with temporary employment authorisation. Save Jobs USA had argued that the longer the case remains in abeyance, greater the harm to US workers. The DHS disagreed, asserting that there is no such indication.In an 11-page argument, the DHS asserted that Save Jobs USA failed to establish that its members’ speculative economic injuries were sufficient to satisfy the DC Circuit’s “high standard for irreparable injury”.The claim of irreparable harm by Save Jobs USA relied on the H-4 rule eliminating or significantly reducing employment opportunities, meaning that the number of available information-technology jobs would significantly decline due to the H-4 rule, it said.“But this relationship has not been shown to be ‘certain’ and ‘actual’, rather than merely ‘theoretical’,” the DHS argued.As such the DHS urged the court to deny the motion of Save Jobs USA, seeking a preliminary injunction enjoining the H-4 rule. Save Jobs USA had sought a stay on the H-4 ruling.An H-4 visa is issued to the spouses of H-1B visa holders, a significantly large number of whom are high-skilled professionals from India. They had obtained work permits under a special order issued by the previous Obama administration in 2015.As of December 2017, the USCIS had approved 1,26,853 applications for employment authorisation for H-4 visa-holders. According to a 2018 report by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), 93 per cent of approved applications for H-4 employment authorisation were issued to individuals born in India and five per cent to individuals born in China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-govt-asks-court-not-to-block-work-permits-to-spouses-of-h-1b-visa-holders/story-ACfGaAie1yBvi7W0FSxECP.html
07-05-2020||World||‘Very insulting’: Trump vetoes measure limiting his war powers in Iran||US President Donald Trump on Wednesday vetoed what he called a “very insulting” congressional resolution seeking to limit his war powers in Iran.In a statement, Trump said he had used his veto because the resolution -- a rare bipartisan rebuke to the president approved in March -- was based on “misunderstandings of facts and law.”The measure stemmed from fears among both Trump’s Republicans and Democrats that the White House was stumbling into war with the Islamic republic.In the statement, Trump says Congress misinterpreted his constitutional authority as being limited to “defense of the United States and its forces against imminent attack.”“That is incorrect,” he said. “We live in a hostile world of evolving threats, and the Constitution recognizes that the President must be able to anticipate our adversaries’ next moves and take swift and decisive action in response. That’s what I did!”The resolution said the US president cannot commit his military to hostilities against Iran or any part of its government or military without explicit authorization from Congress.Supporters said they wanted to ensure that Congress had the unique power to declare war, as outlined in the US Constitution. Trump has preached the need for a drawdown of American military entanglements abroad, but has ramped up a hostile relationship with Iran.His administration has imposed crippling economic sanctions on Tehran. In January, Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Iran’s most powerful general, Qassem Soleimani, at the Baghdad airport.The assassination has inflamed tensions between the two countries.Soleimani was widely seen as the architect of destabilizing activities by Iran around the world, but Democrats and many experts condemned the decision to kill him as disproportionate and provocative. Tehran retaliated with a strike against bases used by the US military in Iraq without causing any fatalities, easing fears of a dramatic escalation. The Trump administration claims it has put Iran back in its box. But a recent verbal escalation following an incident between US ships and Iranian speedboats in the Gulf showed that tensions remain high. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine hit out at Trump for blocking the resolution. “I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to override his veto -- Congress must vote before sending our troops into harm’s way,” he tweeted.To override a veto, two-thirds of the members of both houses of Congress must vote to do so -- unlikely, given the Republican majority in the Senate.It is the second time Trump has vetoed an attempt by Congress to control his military initiatives.In 2019, he blocked an resolution to end US support for Saudi Arabia’s offensive in Yemen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/very-insulting-trump-vetoes-measure-limiting-his-war-powers-in-iran/story-Ob8A6Sq1TieKrHsMwYqOdO.html

07-05-2020||World||UN confirms Russian mercenaries are fighting in Libya: diplomats||Mercenaries from the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organization seen as being close to Vladimir Putin, are fighting in Libya, UN diplomats said Wednesday, citing an experts’ report on the country’s arms embargo.It is the first time the UN has confirmed claims first made in US media that the group is supporting military strongman Khalifa Haftar. Moscow has denied being responsible for deploying the group. The Wagner Group is a shadowy private security firm and thousands of its contractors are believed to be in foreign conflicts from Syria to Ukraine to the Central African Republic.A senior US State Department official has told AFP the group is “an instrument of the Kremlin’s policy” in Libya. “The Panel has identified the presence of private military operatives from ChVK Wagner in Libya since October 2018,” the UN report says, according to several diplomats who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity as the document has not yet been made public.“Wagner has been providing technical support for the repair of military vehicles, participating in combat operations and engaging in influence operations,” the UN report says.They are also involved in “more specialized military tasks such as acting as artillery Forward Observation Officers and Forward Air Controllers, providing electronic countermeasures expertise and deploying as sniper teams,” it continued. “Their deployment has acted as an effective force multiplier” for Haftar, it said.The experts said they could not independently verify how many Wagner mercenaries were in Libya, but estimated their deployment at between 800 and 1,200.The report, submitted on April 24 to the UN Security Council, however says that there are tensions between Wagner and Haftar’s command. The text is an update of the expert panel’s last annual report from December, which had noted the existence of foreign armed groups from Chad and Sudan in the conflict, but did not mention Wagner.It also confirms the presence of another private Russian security company, Rossiskie System Bezopasnosti (RSB) Group, saying they are “providing maintenance and repair support for military aircraft.”But it says observers are still investigating claims that two other organizations -- Moran Security Group and Schit Security Group -- are involved.Pro-Haftar forces have been battling to seize the capital Tripoli from the internationally-recognized government of national accord (GNA) since April 2019.Foreign military involvement has exacerbated the conflict, with the United Arab Emirates and Russia backing Haftar and Ankara supplying the GNA.A January truce brokered by Turkey and Russia has been repeatedly violated.Wagner’s involvement in the conflict was first revealed by The New York Times and The Washington Post last year. The former put their numbers at 200, while the latter said it could be as high as several thousand.The UN report does not recommend sanctions against the groups or any action to prevent their involvement. A report by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres submitted to the Security Council on Tuesday and obtained by AFP also mentioned foreign mercenaries but did not identify them or recommend any action against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-confirms-russian-mercenaries-are-fighting-in-libya-diplomats/story-AtO1O5fFoqQvgJYMh87xlI.html
07-05-2020||World||‘If this thing boomerangs’: Second wave of Covid-19 infections feared||As Europe and the US loosen their lockdowns against the coronavirus, health experts are expressing growing dread over what they say is an all-but-certain second wave of deaths and infections that could force governments to clamp back down.“We are risking a backslide that will be intolerable,” said Dr Ian Lipkin of Columbia University’s Center for Infection and Immunity.Around the world, German authorities began drawing up plans in case of a resurgence of the virus. Experts in Italy urged intensified efforts to identify new victims and trace their contacts. And France, which has not yet eased its lockdown, has already worked up a “reconfinement plan” in the event of a new wave.“There will be a second wave, but the problem is to which extent. Is it a small wave or a big wave? It is too early to say,” said Olivier Schwartz, head of the virus unit at France’s Pasteur Institute.In the US, with about half of the states easing their shutdowns to get their economies restarted and cellphone data showing that people are becoming restless and increasingly leaving home, public health authorities are worried.Many states have not put in place the robust testing that experts believe is necessary to detect and contain new outbreaks. And many governors have pressed ahead before their states met one of the key benchmarks in the Trump administration’s guidelines for reopening -- a 14-day downward trajectory in new illnesses and infections.“If we relax these measures without having the proper public health safeguards in place, we can expect many more cases and, unfortunately, more deaths,” said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy with the Kaiser Family Foundation in Washington.Cases have continued to rise steadily in places such as Iowa and Missouri since the governors began reopening, while new infections have yo-yoed in Georgia, Tennessee and Texas.Lipkin said he is most worried about two things: the reopening of bars, where people crowd together and lose their inhibitions, and large gatherings such as sporting events, concerts and plays. Preventing outbreaks will require aggressive contact tracing powered by armies of public health workers hundreds of thousands of people strong, which the US does not yet have, Lipkin said.Worldwide the virus has infected more than 36 lakh people and killed over a quarter-million, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that experts agree understates the dimensions of the disaster because of limited testing, differences in counting the dead and concealment by some governments.The US has recorded over 70,000 deaths and 12 lakh confirmed infections, while Europe has reported over 140,000 dead.This week, the researchers behind a widely cited model from the University of Washington nearly doubled their projection of deaths in the US to around 134,000 through early August, in large part because of the easing of state stay-at-home restrictions. Newly confirmed infections per day in the US exceed 20,000 and deaths per day are running well over 1,000.In hard-hit New York City, which has managed to bring down deaths dramatically even as confirmed infections continue to rise around the rest of the country, Mayor Bill de Blasio warned that some states may be reopening too quickly.“My message to the rest of the country is learn from how much effort, how much discipline it took to finally bring these numbers down and follow the same path until you are sure that it is being beaten back,” he said on CNN, “or else, if this thing boomerangs, you are putting off any kind of restart or recovery a hell of a lot longer.” A century ago, the Spanish flu epidemic’s second wave was far deadlier than its first, in part because authorities allowed mass gatherings from Philadelphia to San Francisco.“It is clear to me that we are in a critical moment of this fight. We risk complacency and accepting the preventable deaths of 2,000 Americans each day,” epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers, a professor at Johns Hopkins, told a House subcommittee in Washington.President Donald Trump, who has pressed hard to ease the restrictions that have throttled the economy and thrown more than three crore Americans out of work, pulled back Wednesday on White House plans revealed a day earlier to wind down the coronavirus task force.He tweeted that the task force will continue meeting indefinitely with a “focus on SAFETY & OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN”.Underscoring those economic concerns, the European Union predicted the worst recession in its quarter-century history. And the US unemployment rate for April, which comes out on Friday, is expected to hit a staggering 16 per cent, a level last seen during the Great Depression of the 1930s.Governors continue to face demands, even lawsuits, to reopen. In Michigan, where armed demonstrators entered the Capitol last week, the Republican-led Legislature sued Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer, asking a judge to declare invalid her stay-at-home order, which runs at least through May 15.In hard-hit Italy, which has begun easing restrictions, Dr Silvio Brusaferro, president of the Superior Institute of Health, urged “a huge investment” of resources to train medical personnel to monitor possible new cases of the virus, which has killed about 30,000 people nationwide.He said that contact-tracing apps — which are being built by dozens of countries and companies — are not enough to manage future waves of infection.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said after meeting with the country’s 16 governors that restaurants and other businesses will be allowed to reopen in the coming weeks but that regional authorities will have to draw up a “restriction concept” for any county that reports 50 new cases for every 100,000 inhabitants within a week.Lothar Wieler, head of Germany’s national disease control centre, said scientists “know with great certainty that there will be a second wave” of infections.Britain, with over 30,000 dead, the second-highest death toll in the world behind the US, plans to extend its lockdown but has begun recruiting 18,000 people to trace contacts of those infected.In other developments, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said nearly 5,000 coronavirus illnesses and at least 88 deaths have been reported among inmates in American jails and prisons. An additional 2,800 cases and 15 deaths were reported among guards and other staff members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/if-this-thing-boomerangs-second-wave-of-covid-19-infections-feared/story-Y5a7ckdXNggqTVfem5ftrO.html

You know they were going to buy $50 billion worth. The most they ever did was $15 billion and now they are going to $50 billion..., anywhere between $40 and 50 billion in terms of farm. But (the total is) $250 billion overall. That is something that never happened,” he said.“No president has ever even talked about anything like that. It is about time. I will be able to report in about a week or two as to -- not only with the farmers but with many other industries also,” the president said.Trump refrained from answering a question on imposing tariff on China as a punishment for the spread of coronavirus.“I do not want to talk about that now. We are in the midst of some very big thing, so I just do not want to talk about that now,” he said.In the past few weeks, several US lawmakers have called for sanctions against China in response to their alleged cover-up of the coronavirus crisis.“China must be held accountable for its cover-up of the coronavirus outbreak, which led to American lives lost and the devastation of our booming economy,” Senator Steve Daines said.“The Chinese Communist regime withheld information and put the world at risk. Such reckless actions cannot continue to go on without consequences,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-report-in-a-week-or-two-donald-trump-on-china-fulfilling-trade-deal-obligations/story-pE0Dq7KeO7KqCoWC6HUlLM.html
07-05-2020||World||Testosterone-reducing therapy may aid against coronavirus, study shows||Therapy to reduce testosterone and other hormones in men with prostate cancer may have a protective effect against the new coronavirus, a study of thousands of Italian patients showed.Men with the disease who got hormone therapy had a fourfold lower risk of virus infection than patients who didn’t get such treatment, the study showed. The difference was even more pronounced when the research team compared prostate cancer patients on hormone therapy with people who had any other type of cancer.The results don’t mean that virus patients should start taking hormone therapy, cautioned Fabrice Andre, director of research at the Institut Gustave Roussy in Paris and editor-in-chief of Annals of Oncology, where the results were published. But the data show that it would be worth studying the therapy in infected people, Andre said.“This is really a new piece in the puzzle,” said Andrea Alimonti, a professor of oncology at the Universita della Svizzera Italiana and ETH Zurich in Switzerland. Researchers are preparing a follow-up study in which high-risk virus patients would be randomly assigned to take the hormone treatment, and plan to be ready to start if there’s a second wave of infections later this year, Alimonti said.Reducing testosterone might help because a receptor for male hormones also regulates a protein called TMPRSS2, shown in other research to help Covid-19 infect healthy cells. Therapies that suppress male hormones can also decrease TMPRSS2 -- not just in the prostate, but in other tissues in the body, Alimonti said.The study looked at 4,532 men infected with Covid-19 in Italy’s Veneto region, finding that about 10% had cancer, while 2.6% had prostate cancer. Cancer patients had nearly twice the risk of getting the virus compared with the male population as a whole, and got sicker once they were infected. However, among the 5,273 men on hormone therapy for prostate cancer in Veneto, just four got the coronavirus, and none died.One confounding factor could have been that cancer patients on hormone therapy are treated at home instead of going to a hospital, making them better able to stick to social distancing, Alimonti said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/testosterone-reducing-therapy-may-aid-against-coronavirus-study-shows/story-KnneQ6gyJnffFzu0L29dyO.html

Luigi Aurisicchio, CEO of Takis, the firm that claims to have developed the vaccine, said that a coronavirus candidate vaccine has neutralised the virus in human cells for the first time, according to the news report.The researchers experimented with the vaccine on mice that successfully developed antibodies that blocked the virus from infecting the cells. The tests were reportedly carried out at Spallanzani Hospital in Rome.“This is the most advanced stage of testing of a candidate vaccine created in Italy. Human tests are expected after this summer,” Aurisicchio was quoted as saying by ANSA. The researchers observed that five vaccine candidates generated a large number of antibodies, after which two were selected. The vaccine candidates being developed are based on the genetic material of DNA protein “spikes”, the molecular tips used by the coronavirus to enter human cells. The researchers believe that this makes their vaccine particularly effective for generating functional antibodies against the “spike” protein. “To reach our goal, we need the support of national and international institutions and partners who may help us speed up the process,” the Takis CEO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-firm-claims-to-have-made-a-vaccine-to-contain-coronavirus/story-fl2DYhDRTUeGOb8wY0xULM.html

Trump said he may “add or subtract people” from the panel.On Tuesday, while visiting a Honeywell manufacturing facility in Phoenix, Arizona, where he flouted the rule to wear a mask, Trump had revealed his intentions to wind down the task force. “We’re now looking at a little bit of a different form,” he said, adding a “different group” could be set up for phase two.

We’ve written to Lalnunmawia Chuaungo, chief secretary, Mizoram, for an immediate inquiry,” NCW tweeted on Wednesday.The NCW move follows publication of a news report about the incident in Vanglaini, a Mizo daily, on May 5. According to the report, the senior medical officer of Tlabung Civil Hospital in Lunglei district had issued such a notification in March this year.“Voter ID is mandatory for every woman delivering a child at Tlabung Hospital and those who do not possess valid Voter ID cards are not allowed to deliver a child here,” said the notice--Vanglaini mentioned in its report.The matter was brought to the notice of NCW by Paritosh Chakma, president of the Mizoram Chakma Alliance Against Discrimination (MCAAD) who in his complaint termed the hospital move as “bone-chilling, out-rightly unethical, illegal and flagrant violation of right to health”.Chakma alleged that the notification issued by the hospital is part of the continuing discrimination against the minority Chakmas of Mizoram, who face a lot of discrimination in the state despite being Indian citizens.He added that denial of healthcare to a pregnant woman who doesn’t have a Voter ID could even happen in cases when the expectant mother is suffering from Covid-19. This would violate guidelines issued by the Centre on treating Covid-19 patients and could lead to spread of coronavirus from pregnant women.“Thousands of Chakmas were deleted from electoral rolls in 1995 and were never enrolled. Further, there is an unofficial ceiling on number of Chakmas during electoral revisions, which leads to many getting excluded. Obviously, there are hundreds of Chakmas who were not issued Voter ID cards and don’t have one,” Chakma said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncw-asks-mizoram-to-probe-hospital-s-refusal-to-deliver-baby-without-woman-s-voter-id/story-Wdz0SCHE0OrOjSFhGk2SII.html
07-05-2020||India||India raises concern before US special envoy||New Delhi: India on Thursday conveyed its strong concerns about a spike in terrorist violence in Afghanistan to US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, and called for rooting out terror sanctuaries in Pakistan to ensure peace in the war-torn country, people familiar with developments said.The concerns were conveyed to the US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation during his meetings with external affairs minister S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.“The existence of terror sanctuaries in Pakistan and their role in terrorist violence in Afghanistan figured in the meetings,” said one of the people cited above, without giving details.The development came against the backdrop of worries in New Delhi that India’s viewpoint on the Afghan peace process is being given the short shrift by the US, which is apparently focused solely on implementing its deal with the Taliban to facilitate the withdrawal of American forces.India has also been concerned about the increased activities of Pakistan-based terror groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed in Afghanistan and the targeting of minorities, including the March 25 attack on a Sikh place of worship in Kabul that killed nearly 30 people, including an Indian citizen. Indian intelligence agencies believe the Islamic State, which claimed the attack, targeted the Sikhs after being unable to go ahead with plans to strike the Indian embassy.“India is deeply concerned at the upsurge in violence and supports call for immediate ceasefire and [the] need to assist the people of Afghanistan in dealing with [the] coronavirus pandemic,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement on Khalilzad’s meetings.The Indian side “emphasised that putting an end to terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries is necessary for enduring and sustainable peace and stability in Afghanistan”, the statement added, without naming Pakistan.Both Jaishankar and Doval, the statement said, “reiterated India’s continued support for strengthening peace, security, unity, democratic and inclusive polity and protection of rights of all sections of the Afghan society, including Afghan Hindus and Sikhs”.Khalilzad, the first high-level foreign dignitary to travel to New Delhi since Covid-19-related travel restrictions came into effect, visited India as part of a three-nation tour that will also take him to Qatar and Pakistan.He provided an update on the US peace and reconciliation efforts in Afghanistan. The US side “recognised India’s constructive contribution in economic development, reconstruction and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan” and “laid importance to India’s crucial and continuing role in sustainable peace, security and stability in Afghanistan”, the external affairs ministry’s statement said.The Indian side also said it will continue extending humanitarian food and medical supplies to Afghanistan to deal with the pandemic. India recently shipped another 10,000 tonnes of 75,000 tonnes of wheat gifted to Afghanistan from Kandla port to Chabahar port in Iran. The wheat will then be transported by road to Afghanistan. Another 5,000 tonnes of wheat was shipped via Chabahar last month.Khalilzad was accompanied for his meetings by List Curtis, senior director in the National Security Council, and US ambassador Kenneth Juster. In Doha, Khalilzad met Taliban representatives to press for the full implementation of the US-Taliban agreement. In Islamabad, he will meet Pakistani officials to discuss the Afghan peace process.“At each stop, he will urge support for an immediate reduction in violence, accelerated timeline for the start of intra-Afghan negotiations, and cooperation among all sides in addressing the Covid-19 pandemic in Afghanistan,” said a statement issued by the US state department on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-raises-concern-before-us-special-envoy/story-bbnBO00szbsklZx9XVrKTM.html

Earlier, this time period was 30 days. As a result of this, the process of issuing registration/licenses for factories, shops, contractors, bidi manufacturers, motor transport workers etc will be completed in one day,” he added.In another measure, Chouhan announced that the license under the Contract Labour Act will now be issued for the entire period of the contract instead of just one calendar year, as was the case.“The process of issuing registration/license will be online. With a view to encouraging startups, a provision has been made for one-time registration and the provision for renewal has been done away with,” the CM said.According to the CM, another provision has been made to maintain a single register instead of 61 registers under the labour laws and to file a single return instead of 13 returns. Self-certification will suffice for filing the return, he added.Factories have also been exempted from inspections for a period of three months under the Factory Act. The owners will be allowed to have a third-party inspection by the inspectors of their own choice. Establishments employing less than 50 workers have been excluded from inspection in various labour laws. Now, inspection will be possible only with the permission of the labour commissioner and on the basis of complaints, he said.Chouhan also said that the duration of shifts in factories during the ongoing coronavirus crisis has been increased from 8 hours to 12 hours.Congress has opposed the amendments terming it exploitative.Party MLA Hiralal Alawa said, “The amendments will give enough powers to factory owners to exploit the labourers at will as they will have no fear of any inspection or inquiry. The amendments mean the labourers will be treated as bonded labourers and they will not be able to seek justice from the labour courts or it will take years for them to get justice given the complexities involved.”In another coronavirus related development, the MP government said the shops in the non-Covid areas can now remain open from 6 am till midnight. Earlier they were allowed to operate from 8 am to 10 pm daily.

Alleging that there is no information on how many workers were present for work in the factory, the BMS — an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) — has demanded that the NGT should ask the company management and the government to disclose the number.The BMS has also demanded that the company should pay RS 25 lakh as compensation for the dead and RS 5 lakh for those injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-precautionary-measure-no-emergency-alarm-bms-submits-report-on-vizag-gas-leak-to-ngt/story-gcAU2OsyKIrXI2tydE6TFJ.html

The petitioner had also appealed to the HC to direct the state government to provide food and accommodation to the stranded people in their respective states of work instead of bringing them back to Odisha.Soon after the HC order, Surat district collector Dhaval Patel said Odisha government has cancelled the three Shramik special trains scheduled for departure from Surat on Friday. So far 13 Shramik special trains from Surat carrying Odia migrant workers have reached Odisha, while another six left Surat today.The HC order came on the day Odisha registered the largest single-day surge with 34 new Covid cases, most of them among migrant workers from Surat. Of the 1,000 samples of Surat returnees, four per cent have tested positive. Odisha health minister Naba Das, who had a meeting through video-conferencing with union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, said Odisha on Thursday requested for testing of migrants in the States from where they are returning.“We have requested additional testing kits and relaxation in ICMR guidelines. Instead of pre-screening, pre-tests should be conducted as it will help Odisha government in effective tackling of the Covid-19 situation,” Das said.As per the SOP issued by the Centre, migrants are being pre-screened before they are boarding special trains to their home states. Meanwhile, public health expert and the president of Public Health Foundation of India Dr Srinath Reddy today suggested the Odisha government should focus on community protection instead of the development of herd immunity.Delivering a talk on “Learning from Covid-19 – What we have learnt and how we can win” through video conference at the Gurugram Collectorate in Haryana, Dr Reddy said social distancing seemed to be the only solution in the absence of a vaccine or a treatment.“Public cooperation and a community’s active participation is the only shield that can protect us from the deadly infection,” said Dr Reddy, advising the Odisha government to look after the elderly persons as they are more vulnerable to the disease.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“Not only the virus affects the respiratory system, but it also affects the other parts of the human body.

In all probability, he might fly to Visakhapatnam on Friday,” one of his personal staff members said.TDP spokesman and politburo member Varla Ramaiah sought to know how the Jagan Mohan Reddy government had given no-objection certificate to LG Polymers to restart the operations of its plant at Visakhapatnam, though it did not fall into the category of essential goods.“It is a plastic manufacturing company. Apparently, the company got the NOC with the influence of a ruling party leader who claims all rights over Visakhapatnam,” Ramaiah alleged.TDP MP from Vijayawada Kesineni Srinivas demanded that cases should be booked against negligent officers of the industries department and industries minister Mekapati Gautam Reddy also. “I demand the resignation of the irresponsible Industries Minister,” he tweeted.The YSR Congress leaders did not react to the demands and allegations of the TDP leaders.

The MHA asked the state to ensure complete segregation of the Ratha-Khala from the adjoining Grand Road and other properties by erecting a cloth-partition wall.However, the MHA said the decision regarding the holding of Rath Yatra has to be taken by the State Government after assessing the coronavirus situation.Earlier, the state government had sought permission from the Centre for the construction of chariots during the lockdown period.A few days ago, Puri king Gajapati Dibyasinghdev had backed the making of chariots as a construction activity, which is allowed in all Covid-19 zones. Gajapati Dibyasinghdev heads the managing committee of the 12th century temple.The Rath Yatra, scheduled on June 23, is the most important festival in Odisha, attended by over million devotees who throng Puri town for the 10-day long festival. The temple doors have been shut since March 20 due to the pandemic. Only day-to-day rituals are being done by the temple priests.The state government is still in a fix over holding the festival as Covid cases in the state are surging with 34 new cases reported on Thursday taking the state tally to 219. The option to hold the Rath Yatra only in the presence of policemen and temple priests is also being considered. However, the government is not sure about deploying 5000 policemen for pulling the ropes and cordoning off the area, when the cops will be required elsewhere for maintaining the lockdown. The government is also apprehensive of a surge in Covid cases if devotees are allowed to congregate in Puri.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19If the car festival is not held this year, it would be the first time in the last 284 years. In the 425 years of the car festival, the event has been scrapped 32 times, mostly during invasions.

Before the closure too, Karnataka on an average did about Rs 55-60 crore sales per day and despite the hike in prices we expect we will be able to meet our annual target.”In 2019-20 the state had mopped up Rs 19,701 crore of revenue from the sale of liquor (till February as the budget was presented on March 5).

The data also shows that the mortality rate has steadily increased from 3.7% (when the state had just 1000 cases) to 4.3% (at 4000 cases) to 5.9% (at over 6,000 cases).One of the officials in the new team that has taken the charge for Ahmedabad said that the lockdown was not enforced properly and initially, there was laxity in identifying persons infected with the virus.“In the first week to ten days, only those who visited hospital with Covid symptoms were tested. No random testing was done,” he said.Another official of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation said the government reacted only when the cases were reported from localities outside the walled city. It was found that many residents from the walled city areas were allowed to move around in Ahmedabad resulting in the spread of the virus. Several of the super-spreaders in the city were vegetable vendors and workers in grocery stores.

The PPE has been certified to be mass produced and used in clinical Covid-19 situations, he said.“Shortage of PPE during the ongoing Covid-19pandemic is of serious concern as it imperils the well-being and availability of the healthcare workforce, apart from adversely impacting their security and morale…The Indian Navy has risen to this challenge of making available this critical resource in the fight against Covid-19,” navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said.A team formed by the Innovation Cell, Institute of Naval Medicine, Mumbai and the Naval Dockyard Mumbai collaborated to design the PPE.The cost of the PPE is significantly lower than those commercially available and can be produced by basic gown manufacturing units, he said.“The PPE passed with 6/6 synthetic blood penetration resistance test pressure. (Government mandates minimum 3/6 and above level as per ISO 16603 standard),” the official said.Three weeks ago, the DRDO shifted a key testing facility for carrying out quality checks on PPE from Gwalior to New Delhi to cut down delays and ensure faster delivery of the safety gear to healthcare workers.At a time when the country is facing a shortage of PPE kits, the testing facility was shifted from Gwalior-based Defence Research Development Establishment (DRDE) to the Delhi-based INMAS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ppe-kits-developed-by-indian-navy-cleared-by-drdo-testing-agency/story-ewgzXHpSYIAXi5fSVvRrMI.html
07-05-2020||India||India conveys concerns about terror sanctuaries in Pakistan to US special envoy Khalilzad||India on Thursday conveyed its strong concerns about a spike in terrorist violence in Afghanistan to US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, and called for rooting out terror sanctuaries in Pakistan to ensure peace in the war-torn country, people familiar with developments said.The concerns were conveyed to the US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation during his meetings with external affairs minister S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.“The existence of terror sanctuaries in Pakistan and their role in terrorist violence in Afghanistan figured in the meetings,” said one of the people cited above, without giving details.The development came against the backdrop of worries in New Delhi that India’s viewpoint on the Afghan peace process is being given the short shrift by the US, which is apparently focused solely on implementing its deal with the Taliban to facilitate the withdrawal of American forces.India has also been concerned about the increased activities of Pakistan-based terror groups such as Jaish-e-Mohammed in Afghanistan and the targeting of minorities, including the March 25 attack on a Sikh place of worship in Kabul that killed nearly 30 people, including an Indian citizen. Indian intelligence agencies believe the Islamic State, which claimed the attack, targeted the Sikhs after being unable to go ahead with plans to strike the Indian embassy.“India is deeply concerned at the upsurge in violence and supports call for immediate ceasefire and [the] need to assist the people of Afghanistan in dealing with [the] coronavirus pandemic,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement on Khalilzad’s meetings.The Indian side “emphasised that putting an end to terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries is necessary for enduring and sustainable peace and stability in Afghanistan”, the statement added, without naming Pakistan.Both Jaishankar and Doval, the statement said, “reiterated India’s continued support for strengthening peace, security, unity, democratic and inclusive polity and protection of rights of all sections of the Afghan society, including Afghan Hindus and Sikhs”.Khalilzad, the first high-level foreign dignitary to travel to New Delhi since Covid-19-related travel restrictions came into effect, visited India as part of a three-nation tour that will also take him to Qatar and Pakistan.He provided an update on the US peace and reconciliation efforts in Afghanistan. The US side “recognised India’s constructive contribution in economic development, reconstruction and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan” and “laid importance to India’s crucial and continuing role in sustainable peace, security and stability in Afghanistan”, the external affairs ministry’s statement said.The Indian side also said it will continue extending humanitarian food and medical supplies to Afghanistan to deal with the pandemic. India recently shipped another 10,000 tonnes of 75,000 tonnes of wheat gifted to Afghanistan from Kandla port to Chabahar port in Iran. The wheat will then be transported by road to Afghanistan. Another 5,000 tonnes of wheat was shipped via Chabahar last month.Khalilzad was accompanied for his meetings by List Curtis, senior director in the National Security Council, and US ambassador Kenneth Juster. In Doha,Khalilzad met Taliban representatives to press for the full implementation of the US-Taliban agreement. In Islamabad, he will meet Pakistani officials to discuss the Afghan peace process.“At each stop, he will urge support for an immediate reduction in violence, accelerated timeline for the start of intra-Afghan negotiations, and cooperation among all sides in addressing the Covid-19 pandemic in Afghanistan,” said a statement issued by the US state department on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-conveys-concerns-about-terror-sanctuaries-in-pakistan-to-us-special-envoy-khalilzad/story-rJMCY9P7B25bGj5oeNSZAK.html

Out of 502 positive cases, 474 have been discharged leaving 25 patients in the hospitals. Though the state had recorded four deaths it is yet to include the death of a man from Mahe in the state list. Mahe is part of Puducherry.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.The CM said 16,693 people are under observation out of which 16,338 are in their homes and 310 in hospitals. He said the state has started sentinel surveillance to monitor health conditions of a large number of people at one go. Out of 3,035 samples collected for this, 2,337 have tested negative and other results are awaited, he said.The good news came at a time when the state is expected to witness an exodus of expatriates.Called ‘Vande Bharat’ operation, the latest evacuation is being dubbed as the largest since the Kuwait evacuation in 1990 when Iraq invaded that country. But some of the expatriates expressed reservations over the term ‘evacuation’ and insisted that they have paid for their tickets and these are special flights. But many especially pregnant women said they were really thankful to the state and central governments.“I was really worried but now dark clouds have moved. I am delighted to go back to my parents for my first delivery. Really grateful to the both the governments,” said one of them, M S Sanila before boarding the flight to Kozhikokde.The first flight from Abu Dhabi to Kochi is carrying 179 passengers. The second flight from Dubai to Kozhikode has 168 passengers where the maximum number of passengers are from Malappuram. The state government has decided all those found asymptomatic at the airport will have to spend the next seven days at quarantine facilities arranged by the government. After the seven-day period, they will be tested for Covid-19. If they found negative they will be allowed to return to their home where they will have to spend the next seven days in quarantine.But this arrangement goes against the guidelines of the Ministry of Home Affairs which mandates 14 days of institutional quarantine. Since health is a state subject, Kerala has taken a stand that it can decide on such matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-keeps-covid-19-slate-clean-as-first-batch-of-expatriates-head-home/story-m8KaZrpKCsSO6NCCF5R5aP.html
07-05-2020||India||Areas under PoK now in IMD’s forecast||The IMD’s Regional Meteorological Centre has started including cities under Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir in its forecasts, a departure from its earlier format, officials said on Thursday. The IMD has started including Gilgit Baltistan and Muzaffarabad, which are parts of PoK, under the Jammu and Kashmir meteorological sub-division since May 5, said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the Regional Meteorological Department that gives forecast for the northwest meteorological division of the IMD. IMD Director General M Mohapatra said they have been mentioning areas under PoK under its daily weather bulletin ever since the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir in the two union territories August last year. However, officials said it’s now being mentioned explicitly under the Jammu and Kashmir subdivision. These cities of PoK have now found a place in the overall forecast of the northwest division. The northwest division consists of nine sub-divisions – Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi-Chandigarh-Haryana, Punjab, east Uttar Pradesh, west Uttar Pradesh, east Rajasthan and west Rajasthan. The development assumes significance as New Delhi has been of a position that the Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir belongs to India. The inclusion of Muzaffarabad and Gilgit-Baltistan in the forecast comes amid Pakistan’s Supreme Court allowing elections in Gilgit-Baltistan this week. India had strongly reacted to the development. Sources added that internally, it was pointed out that since IMD has been mentioning these cities under the PoK in its daily national weather bulletin and also the local bulletins, they should also find a place in the forecasts of the RMC. Mohapatra said that the IMD, being the World Meteorological Department nominated Regional Meteorological Centre, provides severe weather warnings to Pakistan, Afghanistan, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan detailing forecasts for the next five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/areas-under-pok-now-in-imd-s-forecast/story-C6uM7HLTlq33N1o5pn79uK.html

These are first casualties in the border guarding force due to the infection; both deaths took place this week in Delhi. According to a statement issued by BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bhardwaj, one of the troopers was a critically ill patient. He died after he contracted the infection while visiting a super speciality hospital for his treatment. The second trooper died at Safdarjung hospital on May 4. He was unwell and admitted to the hospital on May 3. The Covid-19 test was done after his death, and the result came on Wednesday. Earlier, a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawan died in Delhi, in the first death in central paramilitary forces due to Covid-19.

07-05-2020||India||With old liquor rates still in play, Uttar Pradesh consumers stock up on favourite brands||The scaled-up liquor prices in Uttar Pradesh didn’t come into effect on Thursday allowing consumers time to stock up at old rates.The state government on Wednesday announced an increase in prices of all categories of liquor, including country liquor, to mop up additional revenue of Rs 2,350 crore.“We have been asked not to increase prices today (Thursday). As soon as we get the clearance, we will increase it, though re-labelling the price on old stock would be difficult,” a liquor seller said.At many places, people were seen buying liquor by the bagful at old rates, as sellers conveniently ignored the ‘limit for sale’ clause that bars buying beyond a certain quantity.Since May 4, when liquor shops reopened to long queues across the state after a six-week closure, revenue of over Rs 300 crore has flowed in, excise officials admit.At least two BJP lawmakers publicly disapproved of the decision to allow liquor sale. One of them said he was worried that social distancing norms were flouted in the rush to grab a bottle.“I fail to understand the need for allowing liquor sale as well as lifting the ban on cigarettes and paan masala,” said BJP’s Unnao MP Sakshi Maharaj.The party’s Kanpur MP Satyadev Pachauri, too, had written to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, expressing concern over the sale of liquor and the flouting of social distancing norms.BJP’s outspoken MLA from Bairia (Ballia) Surendra Singh also wondered why the government had allowed liquor sales. The opposition parties, including the Samajwadi Party, the Congress and the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, have already demanded that the liquor shops be closed again.However, shopkeepers said after the first day, the rush had largely settled down.“Our liquor licence expired on March 31. But due to the lockdown, we have been given seven days to clear our stock after which all the leftover stock would be destroyed. So, before the price hike is effected, we want to make the most of it. The people benefit too and we don’t see anything wrong in it as government is getting much needed revenue,” a liquor seller said.The state government had set an excise revenue target of Rs 31,600 crore for 2019-20, against which it earned Rs 27,323 crore till March before the lockdown saw all bars, clubs, standalone liquor vends and model shops shut down for six weeks.“The excise policy has to be reworked now, given the massive loss of revenue due to closure of liquor shops,” an official said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19WHAT IS ‘LIMIT OF SALE?’The ‘limit of sale’ clause restricts a person from buying beyond a certain limit.For country liquor, both spiced and plain, the limit of sale by retail is 1.5 litres for each variety.In foreign liquor category, six litres of liquor bottled in India or the Indian Made Foreign Liquor can be purchased. This includes whisky, brandy, rum (including white rum), gin and vodka. Similar is the sale limit for imported foreign liquor, bottled in the country of its origin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-old-liquor-rates-still-in-play-uttar-pradesh-consumers-stock-up-on-favourite-brands/story-ov5BbLRRzoeNatf7rnJtsI.html
07-05-2020||India||No new Covid-19 case reported from 13 states, UTs in last 24 hrs: Health Minister Harsh Vardhan||Thirteen states and Union Territories, including Kerala, Odisha and Jammu and Kashmir, have not reported any new case of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Thursday.Informing reporters that 3,561 new coronavirus cases have been reported and 1,084 patients have recovered in 24 hours since Wednesday morning, he asserted that “in comparison with other countries, India is in a better state as the fatality rate is 3.3 per cent and recovery rate is 28.83 per cent.” Of the total 35,902 active cases, 4.8 per cent patients are in ICU, 1.1 per cent on ventilators and 3.3 per cent are on oxygen support.Vardhan reviewed the preparedness and containment measures for the management of Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal, and said 180 districts across the country have not reported any new instance of the respiratory infection in less than seven days.Another 180 districts had no fresh case in the last seven to 13 days. As many as 164 districts have not registered any new case in 14-20 days, while 136 districts have not reported any case of coronavirus infection in the last 21 to 28 days, he was quoted as saying in a health ministry statement.The 13 states and Union Territories which have not reported any new case in the last 24 hours are Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Kerala, Mizoram, Manipur, Goa, Meghalaya, Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.Daman and Diu, Sikkim, Nagaland and the Lakshadweep Islands have not reported a single case till date, he said.“Covid-19 testing capacity has increased. As many as 95,000 tests are being conducted daily in 327 government and 118 private laboratories. Cumulatively, 13,57,442 tests have been done so far,” the minister said.Elaborating on the country’s preparedness in terms of health infrastructure, Vardhan said as of now there are 821 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals with 1,50,059 beds (1,32,219 isolation and 17,840 ICU beds) and 1,898 dedicated health centres with 1,19,109 beds (1,09,286 isolation and 9,823 ICU beds) along with 7,569 quarantine centres.The Union health minister also said that 29.06 lakh personal protective equipment (PPEs) and 62.77 lakh N-95 masks have been distributed to states, Union Territories and central institutions.After a brief presentation on the status of Covid-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal, Vardhan said the states need to focus on effective surveillance, contact tracing and early diagnosis to the Covid-19 fatality rate low.“Surveillance for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) and Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) should be intensified in unaffected districts and in areas which have not reported cases for the last 14 days and more through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) network in collaboration with medical college hospitals.  “Such measures will help in indicating the presence of any possible hidden infection at an early stage and in turn timely containment,” he said.Vardhan asked the states to ensure adoption of infection prevention and control practices in all healthcare facilities to reduce and avoid chances of infections among healthcare workers. He advised them to implement all central guidelines and advisories in the field level.The states have been informed about the measures taken to partner with private hospitals for Covid-19 management. Uttar Pradesh has stated that it has identified private hospitals as dedicated Covid-19 health facilities on payment basis.In view of the surge in the number of stranded migrant labourers expected to reach their native states in the coming days, Vardhan stressed on drawing up a robust strategy and mechanism for their testing, quarantine, and treatment of positive cases.“Some states shall people returning from abroad too. An effective strategy needs to be put in place for their testing, institutional quarantine and treatment if needed,” he said.It was reiterated to the states to ensure provisioning of non-coronavirus essential health services such as immunisation drives, tuberculosis case finding and treatment, blood transfusion for patients requiring dialysis, treatment of cancer patients and antenatal care of pregnant women among others, the health ministry statement said.“It was also stated that the Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres could be used for screening for hypertension, diabetes and three types of cancers. Telemedicine and tele-counselling could be used for a larger population in view of the lockdown.

In a letter to Pradhan on May 4, the CM said the NMDC had to pay Rs 1,623 crore to the Chhattisgarh government following the Supreme Court order in 2014 order as penalty for violations. The SC order was not challenged by NMDC, which so far, paid Rs 600 crore to the state government.“When the entire country was facing an acute shortage of iron ore due to en masse lapsing of missing leases elsewhere in the country, NMDC did not face any problem in Chhattisgarh. Even today, those mining leases have not been operationalized in favour of NMDC in many states. But, in Chhattisgarh, we have been very cooperative and all the mining leases of NMDC have been extended within time and mines are operational without any hindrance,” the letter said.The CM also questioned why the NMDC pledged CSR funds to the PM Cares fund.“NMDC has not been keeping up with its commitments given to the state government for more than one occasion…NMDC has diverted the rightful CSR funds of people of Chhattisgarh to the newly created PM Cares fund and has not paid the penalty amount in full to the state government,” the letter read.The CM in his lRaipuretter said that it is important for a PSU like NMDC to act more responsibly during such a crisis.“I expect that government of India should not be a mute spectator and instruct NMDC to act in a duty bound manner and make the payments to the state government at the earliest,” the letter said, while asking NMDC to “win over the hearts of people of Chhattisgarh” by standing up with them.“We have been active in containing the spread of Covid-19. In this crisis situation, the state government needs financial resources and people of Chhattisgarh are looking for their legitimate resources to come during these hours of crisis,” the CM said while asking Pradhan to facilitate the release of the pending Rs 1,000 crore.Reacting to the letter, NMDC spokesperson Jay Prakash said: “NMDC has excellent relations with Chhattisgarh government and we are sure all issues will be amicably resolved, safeguarding the interests of Chhattisgarh state and NMDC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhatisgarh-cm-reminds-centre-of-rs-1000-cr-penalty-on-nmdc-after-it-donates-rs-150-cr-to-pm-cares/story-OUUIseU7Ok9xzBaOJjod1O.html

A major leak from a chemical plant of LG Polymers near Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh in the wee hours of Thursday impacted villages within a five-km radius, leaving eight people dead and scores of citizens complaining of breathlessness, nausea and other problems.Para-tertiary butyl catechol or PTBC is currently being used in Visakhapatnam to neutralise the effect of the gas leak, said Ashwani Kumar, secretary in the Gujarat chief minister’s office.“This chemical, used for reducing the effects of gas in the air after a leak, is manufactured only in Vapi. The Andhra Pradesh government requested Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani to facilitate airlifting of the chemical from Vapi to be sent there as soon as possible,” Kumar said.As instructed by Rupani, senior officials have asked Valsad district collector to make necessary arrangements to procure 500 kg of the chemical. The stock will soon be airlifted from Daman where it will be taken by road from Vapi, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vizag-gas-leak-guj-govt-to-send-chemical-used-as-neutraliser/story-MZfAue72bO0vMPk0rAVaaP.html

Hundreds of chickens in poultry farms in the surrounding villages were also found dead with their bodies turning a darker shade of grey under the effect of gas.Such was the impact of the gas that leaves on trees along the road near the chemical plant wilted turning reddish brown and pale yellow.The incident has claimed 11 lives and more than 300 have been hospitalised. It evoked memories of the gas leaked from a pesticide plant in Madhya Pradesh’s Bhopal in 1984. That incident, counted among one of the world’s worst industrial disasters, had killed 3,500 people.“Today’s incident might not be of such a magnitude as that of the Bhopal tragedy. But it is certainly a major disaster in Visakhapatnam after the 1997 explosion of a cylinder at Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited in which 22 people were killed,” said Rajesh Mallu, a senior journalist from the port city.People were running for their own lives in such a hurry that they did not even bother to check about their old beloved kin. A five-year-old girl, Sucharita, was found crying on the road side near Chintala Agraharam village, where the local farmers rescued and consoled her.Apparently, Sucharita’s parents, who were feeling suffocating due to the impact of gas, failed to carry her along with them as they were running for a safer location. A local journalist finally managed to locate her father Raju at another village about two km away and hand over the child to him.“We were running in a semi-conscious state to find a safer place and we didn’t even realise that our daughter is not with us. I am glad my daughter is fine and back with us”, Raju said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unconscious-people-animals-turning-grey-scenes-outside-vizag-plant/story-rjjv4xOA5VpRauyecSQlZO.html

The migrants said due to the lockdown they neither had money nor food and were suffering from a lot of problems. The police have sent them back after giving them food.Thousands of labourers come from different parts of UP and Bihar to earn a livelihood from mining-related activities in Guala river area in Nainital and US Nagar district every year. Labourers have been stranded this year due to the lockdown. They have been sitting completely idle and suffering from acute financial crisis. In such a distressing condition, they wanted to return to their native places and began using forest routes.Fed up with continuous unemployment and financial crisis amid lockdown, a large number of labourers from UP and Bihar set out on foot to their native places through forest routes, but were stopped by villagers and police. They used the forest routes instead of main roads to dodge the police and avoid police action.“We were brought by a contractor here for mining but work has been stopped due to the lockdown. We have been sitting idle and facing financial problems for the last 47 days. So we felt it was better to return to our villages,” said Mangal Rajbhar, a resident of Azamgarh in UP. He was part of the group of labourers which was stopped by villagers in Shaktifarm area.“Since we ran out of money and to avoid strict police action, we chose forest routes. We were determined to cover hundreds of kilometres distance on foot. There is no hope of mining work reopening here and if we stay here for more weeks we will start starving. If we reach our villages, at least we will live comfortably there despite unemployment,” Ramesh Prasad, another labourer said.Since there is no mode of transport available and fear of action by the police for attempting to cross the sealed border between UP and Uttarakhand, these labourers chose the forest routes and set out on foot for their destinations instead of main roads.“The registration process is on by the administration for such stranded labourers to drop them to their native places, but due to lack of awareness they set out on foot,” said an official.“We told them that it is better to go back because even the UP administration will not spare them following the violation of lockdown. They will face unnecessary police action there. When we persuaded them, they agreed to go back by bus to Nainital district. They had reached here in two groups and arrived in Shaktifarm and Nanakmatta through the forest,” Vivek Prakash, sub-divisional magistrate, Sitarganj said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/240-migrants-take-forest-routes-in-kumaon-to-reach-up-bihar-caught/story-SN6d3MfmZWsqcO2okfbnAL.html

Dr Y K Gupta, who is chairing the committee for Evaluation of Research Proposals at ICMR, said the evidence and data available at the moment is not strong enough to start the clinical studies by different routes/forms of Ganga water for treatment of coronavirus. The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), an arm of the Jal Shakti Ministry that deal with the rejuvenation programme for the river, had received a number of proposals, including from people and NGOs working on Ganga, to undertake clinical studies for treatment of coronavirus patients with the water, officials said. The proposals were accordingly sent to the ICMR. Gupta, who is also a former dean of the AIIMS, said, “At present the proposals needs much scientific data, proof of concept and a strong background hypothesis. This has been conveyed to them (NMCG).”  NMCG officials said the proposals were discussed with the scientists of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), which had earlier conducted a study ‘Assessment of Water Quality and Sediment to understand the special properties of River Ganga’. According to the NEERI study, Ganga water has higher number of bacteriophages as against pathogenic bacteria. During consultations that were held between the NMCG and NEERI, the scientists had also said there is still no proof that Ganga water or sediment has anti-viral properties. “We forwarded the proposals to the ICMR as received,” said a senior official of the NMCG. One of the proposals received by NMCG claimed that the waters of Ganga have “ninja virus” which scientists call bacteriophages. Another proposal claimed that pure Ganga water boosts immunity which helps fight the virus. The third proposal, a much detailed one, sought more research on Ganga water’s anti-viral properties and its ability to boost immunity in fighting diseases.  NMCG officials said they have not received any official communication on the status of their proposals from the ICMR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-more-data-icmr-on-proposed-study-of-ganga-water-for-treating-covid-19/story-iOq9ToWrucCh3buXaoTXKN.html

On Wednesday, too, the tablets were distributed among around 1,200 workers who arrived in a train from Kerala. The second train arrived at Berhampore in Murshidabad district. The district’s chief medical officer of health, Dr Prasanta Biswas, said all labourers were screened for symptoms of the coronavirus disease and given the tablets.The West Bengal Doctors Forum on Wednesday wrote to the state health secretary, attaching links to news items in which government staff were quoted saying they had given these tablets to hundreds of migrant workers. The letter from the Forum said, “As per the advisory available from the Government of West Bengal vide Order No. H&FW/139/20 dated April 10, 2020, in accordance with the Indian Council of Medical Research Advisory Memo No. VIR/4/2020/ECD-I dated 22nd March, 2020, the prophylactic use of HCQ for SARS - Cov- 2 is clearly indicated for two specific selected groups of people: Asymptomatic Healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19 and asymptomatic household contact of laboratory confirmed cases.” Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.“We were confused when he saw on television that these tablets were being indiscriminately given to migrant workers returning from other states.

This is done following ICMR protocols, said Dr Chaki.In March, the ICMR had warned people against the indiscriminate use of hydroxychloroquine or HCQ after reports that there has been a rush to buy the medicine, which India has approved as a prophylaxis (a treatment to prevent a disease) in the fight against the deadly coronavirus infection (Covid-19).On April 23, an ICMR official said it will continue with the restricted use of HCQ to treat patients critically ill with Covid-19.On April 25, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on warned doctors against prescribing hydroxychloroquine touted by President Donald Trump for treating coronavirus except in hospitals and research studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctors-ask-why-migrant-workers-returning-to-bengal-are-given-hcq-tablets/story-ewUDEALF4o6VvgfOXfsf7J.html
07-05-2020||India||Vizag gas leak: Plant produced stuff used to make disposable plastic cutlery||LG Polymers India, the company behind the deadly styrene gas leak in Visakhapatnam that left at least nine dead and hundreds hospitalised, is a subsidiary of leading South Korean chemical firm LG Chem that had entered India in 1997 through the acquisition of a local company. The Vizag plant manufactures polystyrene (PS) that finds wide utility in the food-service industry as rigid trays and containers, disposable utensils, and foamed cups, plates and bowls. The company, according to its website, was established in 1961 as ‘Hindustan Polymers’ by the Shriram Group for manufacturing PS and its co-polymers at Visakhapatnam. It got merged with MC Dowell & Co Ltd of UB Group in 1978. Considering India as an important market for its aggressive global growth plans, LG Chem in July 1997 acquired Hindustan Polymers and renamed it as LG Polymers India Pvt Ltd (LGPI) in July 1997. The factory recorded 222.8 billion won (USD 181.8 million) in revenue and 6.3 billion won in net profit last year. In terms of sales, the parent company LG Chem was the 10th largest chemical company in the world in 2017. LGPI’s Visakhapatnam factory was being prepared to reopen on Thursday after the lockdown when the accident took place. Company workers were preparing to restart the operation when the gas started to leak in the early hours. As much as 1,800 tonnes of styrene is said to have been in the storage tank when the leakage happened. Due to stagnation and changes in temperature, styrene could have resulted in auto polymerisation that could have caused vapourisation. Styrene gas is a flammable liquid that is used to make polystyrene plastics, fiberglass, rubber, and latex. The accident at the Visakhapatnam factory raised questions on the improper maintenance of chemicals in the industry and reminded of the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy, the world’s worst industrial disasters. “LG Chemical has a very strong presence in Styrenics business in South Korea and has plans to establish an equally strong presence in the Indian market by the current product range of PS and EPS,” the company says on its website. “Presently, LGPI is one of the leading manufacturers of polystyrene and expandable polystyrene in India.

Two patients had died earlier.61 of the remaining 78 patients have already been discharged and the rest are in quarantine, to be discharged soon.The state has fared well overall in terms of recoveries with half of the total coronavirus positive patients now cured. The state has also reduced the backlog of pending tests from 5,000 three days ago to under 2,000, data released on Wednesday showed.Officials of the state health department said Rajasthan’s recovery rate was better than top 10 Covid-19 infected states in the country. According to data shared by states up to May 5, While India’s overall recovery rate was 27.66 per cent, the recovery rate in Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh was more.State health minister Raghu Sharma said around 52 % of Covid 19 positive patients in the state have turned negative because of extensive surveillance, quarantining, maximum sampling and testing.“Till Thursday afternoon, 3,400 people were fund corona positive, of which 1,740 are cured after treatment and 1,284 have been discharged,” he said.On the other hand, a sudden spike in new cases has alarmed the government, leading to the sealing of borders with the neighbouring states on Thursday.Rajasthan in last 24-hours has registered over 200 Covid-19 positive cases, taking the tally of active cases in the state to 1,565, till Thursday afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-in-good-and-bad-news-5-rajasthan-districts-are-disease-free-but-sudden-spike-causes-alarm/story-ly01Ha6lwpbJJarv9ti1OJ.html

According to the US, Salahuddin had committed or poses a “significant risk of committing acts of terrorim”.But that classification hasn’t made a difference to the Hizbul Mujahideen boss who has the support of Pakistan’s deep state and has been participating in public events for years. The Pakistan government had then declared that it will not act against Salahuddin since the United Nations Security Council hadn’t classified him as a terrorist.Islamabad hasn’t acted against those designated by the UNSC either. There are about 130 individuals who have been sanctioned by the UNSC. On them, Pakistan says it can’t find most of the individuals sanctioned by the UNSC due to inadequate or inaccurate information about them in UNSC dossiers.Riyaz Naikoo’s luck ran out at 7th hideoutSyed Salahuddin’s statement described Riyaz Naikoo’s status in the Hizbul Mujahideen hierarchy as its chief commander. His elimination is a huge setback to the terror group and will lead to its weakening in south Kashmir, where the Hizbul has traditionally been active, a senior police officer said.This part of Kashmir is also where Riyaz Naikoo had an extensive network.He had many hideouts in this area, Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar said on Thursday. Kumar said they had already busted six of his hideouts. The one where he was found dead after the firefight with security forces was his seventh. Because there was a possibility that this house could be linked to others in the vicinity via underground tunnels, the security forces even brought earth-digging equipment, including four JCB machines, to block any such effort to slip out.Kumar said it was natural that the terror group would be impacted by his elimination. “Riyaz Naikoo was the most experienced… When the next one is named, we will go after him…. We already know who it is going to be,” the Kashmir region’s top police officer said.Syed Salahuddin’s statement on Thursday did not name anyone. He hadn’t formally designated Riyaz Naikoo either who was seen to be the de facto chief of the Hizbul in Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/riyaz-naikoo-setback-upsets-syed-salahuddin-says-the-spark-will-spread-in-region/story-TfBIKLGprQk6uTmYhwOldM.html
07-05-2020||India||Patient can WhatsApp, SMS or email consent for Covid-19 clinical trials: ICMR draft guidelines||Patients, who have been chosen for clinical trials, can now give their consent electronically through a text message, WhatsApp or other mobile-based applications because of mobility restrictions due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) draft guidelines for ethics committees that review biomedical and health research in the country. “A lot has changed because of the pandemic situation, especially restrictions imposed on in-person meetings and physical movements. Many patients won’t be accessible in person because of Covid-19. Besides, we need to maintain social distancing and nobody would like to exchange a lot of papers. We decided to make use of the technology in a bid to ensure that research work doesn’t suffer,” said Dr. Roli Mathur, head, ICMR’s bioethics unit, who drafted the guidelines. “The onus, more than ever, lies on a researcher to adequately inform the subjects of the pros and cons related to the project since the option of digital consent is readily available. The concept of ‘informed consent’ has assumed more significance, where a researcher needs to explain a patient to the best of ability,” she said. The ethics committee quorum, where a minimum number of members is required to be present during a meeting, for decisions to be valid can also meet virtually. “Earlier, it was imperative for ethics committee members to meet in person. But of late, we’re getting a number of queries from various ethics committee members, who are pleading their inability to meet in person. The guidelines weren’t clear about whether the quorum could be held online. But, our experts are of the opinion that it is feasible to conduct ethics committee meetings online,” Dr. Mathur said. Emerging trends suggest that online ethics meetings are likely to become a permanent feature even after the Covid-19 pandemic eases in the near future.“We have smoothly transitioned to digital media to conduct meetings, even though there was initial reluctance among a section of members because of perceived technical glitches. However, it has turned out to be a workable idea, as it saves travel time, easier to co-ordinate, etc. It may evolve into a permanent feature in the near future,” she added. The new guidelines suggest that if members of an ethics panel are not available for any reason, a researcher can approach another ethics committee to seek its consent. “On the one hand, there is a need to undertake research on a priority basis, and on the other to ensure that this doesn’t compromise scientific validity and ethical requirements. This is the appropriate time to respond to humanitarian emergencies by adopting novel methodologies, designing innovative methods, appropriate use of digital platforms and new technology, effective management of limitations of time, infrastructure, resources, and enable quick communication,” Dr. Balram Bhargava, director-general, ICMR, wrote in the foreword to the draft guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patient-can-whatsapp-sms-or-email-consent-for-covid-19-clinical-trials-icmr-draft-guidelines/story-kxpOESR82JZlaDq2sW2XnL.html

He also asked the Centre to rush experts with the knowledge of treating victims of Styrene Gas- a carcinogenic chemical. He added that a two-pronged treatment protocol was needed given the prevalent coronavirus infections which weaken a person’s lung and immunity system.“I request you to send medical experts from India and globally to treat the victims of Styrene Gas. Further, Covid-19 infects the lungs and reduces the immunity of a person. Hence, it is essential that the medical aid should be two pronged, keeping in mind Covid-19 and Styrene Gas,” wrote Naidu.Poisonous Styrene vapour leaked from a chemical plant in Vishakhapatnam in the early hours of Thursday, killing nine people and sickening over a thousand others, as it spread to nearby villages in a five-kilometre radius. The leak happened while the plant was preparing to reopen following ease of restrictions on industrial activity during the third-phase of national lockdown.Director General of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) SN Pradhan said 500 people from 200-250 families living in the 3 km radius of the plant have been evacuated to safer places. The leak occurred from a plant that was holding about 1,800 kilo litres of the poisonous chemical, said news agency PTI.Centre has already rushed a specialised CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear) team from the National Disaster Relief Force along with medical specialists. Director General of (NDRF) S N Pradhan said the leakage from the factory is now minimal but the NDRF personnel will be at the spot till it is totally plugged, reported PTI.Also Read: Andhra poisonous gas leak: Rs1 crore relief for deaths, 10 lakh for critical patients, probe ordered into incident||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-gas-leak-chandrababu-naidu-demands-to-shut-down-lg-polymers-plant-seeks-centre-s-help/story-FwVAqIajuL5nmLXU4p2HbM.html

07-05-2020||India||Deliberately infecting healthy people with coronavirus may speed Covid vaccine studies, says WHO||Deliberately infecting healthy volunteers with the virus that causes Covid-19 may speed studies of vaccines against the deadly pathogen, the World Health Organization said.Such studies, which pose significant potential dangers to subjects, may be considered in dire situations and with certain disclosures and protections, a working group of the United Nations health agency said in a report posted Wednesday on its website.Researchers around the world are racing to develop vaccines to protect against the deadly coronavirus and allow countries to rebuild teetering economies. So-called challenge studies, where treatments or preventatives are tested directly against the infection in informed volunteers, might speed the path of vaccines to the public.Challenge studies “can be substantially faster to conduct than vaccine field trials,” according to the working group paper, “in part because far fewer participants need to be exposed to experimental vaccines in order to provide (preliminary) estimates of efficacy and safety.”Eight ConditionsThe report laid out eight conditions that would need to be fulfilled for challenge studies to be considered, including scientific justification, an assessment of potential benefits and the fully informed consent of subjects.Initial studies should be limited to young, healthy adults from 18 to 30 years old. Tests might prioritize those who are most likely to get infected while taking care not to inappropriately target the poor and otherwise socially vulnerable, the report said.Health-care workers and researchers would be particularly appropriate for coronavirus challenge studies, according to the report, as they already face a higher probability of infection and are well informed about its risks.Challenge studies hold the potential to reduce coronavirus mortality around the world but pose significant potential dangers for volunteers, scientists led by Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard School of Public Health epidemiologist, suggested in a recent paper.“Obviously, challenging volunteers with this live virus risks inducing severe disease and possibly even death,” they said in March in an article in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.Vaccines are usually tested in a large group whose results are compared with those from a separate group of unvaccinated people. Waiting for both groups to become exposed to the illness in their regular daily lives can take months, while challenge studies would ensure that the subjects would promptly come into contact with the virus.Officials at Moderna Inc., where a vaccine for Covid-19 is in development, aren’t enthusiastic about the idea.“I’m not sure I am a huge fan of it really for both practical and ethical reasons,” said Tal Zaks, Moderna’s chief medical officer, during a presentation put on by the health news organization Stat on Wednesday. “As is often the case, the devil is in the details.”Zaks said he wasn’t sure that a challenge study, which could take months to design and implement, would speed development of the company’s product, which is already entering the second of three phases of study. The shot would have to prevent the development of disease, not just mild infections, or it would be hard to know if the dose picked was the right one, he said.Foundation 1daysooner has a website where people can sign up to participate in a human challenge trial for Covid-19, if one were to occur. Nearly 14,000 volunteers from 102 countries have signed up so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deliberately-infecting-healthy-people-with-coronavirus-may-speed-covid-vaccine-studies-says-who/story-RK74T8dCPwpbeILOafZQ9I.html

While one of the patients died today, another borderman had passed away on Monday at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital.“DG BSF and all ranks mourn the untimely demise of the corona warriors of BSF. BSF fraternity conveys condolences and stands firm with the bereaved families,” the force said in a statement on Thursday.These are the first cases of death in the BSF due to Covid-19 and the second among paramilitary forces after a 55-year-old sub-inspector of the CRPF had succumbed to the disease last month.The total number of infections or active cases in the 2.5 lakh personnel strong force now stand at 193 after 41 fresh cases were reported, the BSF said in the statement. Two jawans have recovered.“While all instructions and protocols issued by the health ministry are strictly followed, it is pertinent to mention that BSF establishments have established well equipped quarantine/isolation centres as per the prescribed norms to prevent the contagion. The composite hospitals of BSF are dedicated Covid-19 Health Centres (DCHC) and are diligently handling cases of BSF personnel,” the statement further said.Eighty-five BSF personnel tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. This was the highest spike in Covid-19 cases in a day in any of the paramilitary forces.The BSF has reported most of its cases from Delhi, Kolkata and Tripura. BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bhardwaj said that the infections have been reported while performing operational and essential duties. Bhardwaj said that each establishment of the BSF is following the standard operating procedures that are in place to contain the coronavirus disease.The central paramilitary forces now have over 400 cases across the country.Around 10 lakh strong border guarding forces are deployed for counter-insurgency, border guarding and law and order duties across the country.

All the new Covid-19 positive cases are asymptomatic and have been kept at quarantine centres on their return to Odisha, the health department officials said.On Wednesday, another nine migrant workers, who recently returned from Surat, tested Covid-19 positive in Jagatsinghpur, Ganjam and Kendrapara districts.Of the 206 Covid-19 positive cases in the state, around half have either returned from Surat or Kolkata.Till Wednesday, 35,540 migrant workers had returned to Odisha. Another five lakh is expected to arrive over the next few weeks, and the state government has arranged an equal number of quarantine beds in around 12,000 makeshift medical camps. State health department officials said that the curve is unlikely to be flattened in the coming days, as Odisha is expecting an influx of stranded migrant labourers.Odisha reported its first Covid-19 positive cases in 37 days, and the figure doubled in only 11 days, raising concerns for the state government.On March 15, only one district Khurda, had reported a Covid-19 positive case, but it has since spread to 16 of the 30 districts in the state.Special Relief Commissioner Pradeep Kumar Jena has asked all district collectors and municipal commissioners to ensure spot registration of non-enrolled migrant returnees in temporary medical camps immediately after their arrival from other states.To make matters worse, hundreds of migrants, who returned from Surat, flouted state government’s guidelines and did not register their vehicles on the Covid-19 portal giving the journey details.The government is worried about the rampant violation of norms that are putting paid to its containment plans.For instance, in some quarantine centres in Ganjam district, over 100 migrant returnees fled as a mark of protest against lack of food and water and in another case they threw away ‘unpalatable’ food.The authorities have booked seven people at a quarantine centre in coastal Bhadrak district for filming a video in violation of social distancing norms. Allegations are also doing the rounds about some migrant returnees, who are quietly slinking away at the dead of night from the quarantine centres to spend time with their families.Though the state government has issued stern warnings against such indiscretions, officials said they did not want to be seen heavy-handed in their approach while dealing with the migrants. “Don’t look down at the migrant returnees, as they’ve returned from the states that have emerged as Covid-19 hotspots. Though some of them have tested Covid-19 positive, we need to treat them properly,” said Subroto Bagchi, state government’s spokesperson on Covid-19.“The returnees have the same rights as anybody else living in Odisha. In fact, they’ve more rights on the state’s resources, as they are in distress due to the loss of their livelihoods because of lockdown restrictions,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-posts-highest-single-day-surge-in-covid-positive-cases/story-EpVEHhwOnCcVUOXXofElHK.html
07-05-2020||India||Andhra poisonous gas leak: Rs1 crore relief for deaths, 10 lakh for critical patients, probe ordered into incident||The Andhra Pradesh government on Thursday announced Rs 1 crore as compensation for each of the deceased in Visakhapatnam poisonous gas leak incident. He also announced Rs 10 lakh for those put on a ventilator as a result of the leak and Rs 1 lakh for those who have been hospitalised due to the incident.At least 9 people have died and more than a thousand have fallen sick due to the leak of poisonous gas Styrene from the LG Polymers unit at R R Venkatapuram on the outskirts of Visakhapatnam on Thursday morning. The state government also announced a compensation of Rs 25,000 for the gas-leak affected patients who are under treatment without hospitalization at the OPDs (Out Patient Department) and Rs 10,000 each for affected families from the five villages adjoining the LG plant.Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy said that those who have lost cattle due to the leak will get full compensation for the loss; besides Rs 20,000 to each family.The state government has also appointed a committee to probe the incident and the government indicated that the LG Polymers plant could be relocated if found necessary. The incident happened in the wee hours on Thursday when the plant was preparing to resume operations in line with the relaxations for the resumption of industrial activities, extended at the start of the third phase of the nationwide lockdown to fight coronavirus. State industries minister M Goutham Reddy said that the leakage of gas might have occurred from the tank storing Styrene in liquid form. The minister said the liquid turns into a gaseous state at a temperature of more than 20 degrees Celsius. He added that the cap of the storage tank is learnt to have come off, leading to the leak. Initial reports suggested that the engineers attempted to seal the mouth but the damage had been done by that time, he added.He claimed that the company- LG Polymers-- was asked to confirm with all safety protocols before reopening the plant following lockdown relaxations.The plant is located at R R Venkatapuram area near Gopalapatnam, which is close to Visakhapatnam international airport. People in nearby residential areas were fast asleep when the incident took place.When the poisonous gas reached the residential areas, many people rushed on to the streets complaining of a pungent smell difficult to bear. Several people collapsed on the streets while a large section of residents, including the children and the old people, fainted within their homes, said Visakhapatnam’s assistant commissioner of police, Swaroopa Rani.Also Read: Gas leak might have occurred from chemical plant’s storage tank: Andhra Pradesh minister||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-poisonous-gas-leak-rs1-crore-relief-for-deaths-10-lakh-for-critical-patients-probe-ordered-into-incident/story-3JdMGe6U7CiyJZzM6xMHbK.html

07-05-2020||India||Styrene is lethal and carcinogenic if inhaled in high quantities: Experts||Styrene gas which leaked from the LG Polymers unit at R R Venkatapuram on the outskirts of Visakhapatnam, is a lethal chemical that can have a carcinogenic (cancer causing) effect on human beings, if inhaled in high quantities, experts said.According to P Prasada Rao, an environmental engineer with the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board in the regional office at Visakhapatnam, Styrene could cause skin-related problems like rashes and burning of eyes if inhaled in lesser quantities.But if it would affect the brain if inhaled in high quantities and people fall into an unconscious state. It has a carcinogenic effect on such people in the long run. “We are right now assessing as to what extent this chemical has entered the air and its impact on the people,” Rao said.Styrene is a common chemical used in the plastic industry. “If the quantity of consumption is very high and the proximity is intense, then it can be lethal,” S N Pradhan, Director General of the National Disaster Response Force said.State industries minister P Gautam Reddy also admitted that Styrene has carcinogenic property. “I was told it is in a liquid form stored in the storage tank of the plant for the last 45 days and at 20 degrees Celsius and above, it would convert into gaseous form. Apparently, the gas leaked out of the tank due to opening of the lid. The technicians of the plant closed the lid within a short time but the damage was already done,” he said.An official in the industries department who preferred anonymity said preliminary studies revealed that the company authorities had apparently not maintained the stipulated temperature during the lockdown period and subsequently while taking up the maintenance work before reopening.It is learnt as many as 25 workers were involved in the maintenance work at the chemical tanks. On the night shift, they also kept the mandatory antidote in the form of water spray ready. Forensic experts are assessing if the workers did not use the antidote or if it did not work.There was 2,000 metric tons of the gas (liquid) in the tank that created the problem. Another tank has 3,000 metric tons of the gas stored.Noted environmentalist and former Union energy secretary E A S Sarma wondered how the state pollution control board had granted permission for expansion of the plant in 2019 without obtaining approvals from the Centre.He also questioned how the state government had granted a No Objection Certificate to resume the plant operations though it was not an “essential” industry. By no stretch of imagination, a plastic manufacturing unit like this can be called essential, he pointed out.LG Polymers, a group of company of South Korea-based LG Chem, originally began as Hindustan Polymers in 1961 at Visakhapatnam. Later, it merged with UB Group in 1978 and in 1997; it was taken over by LG Chem which changed the company’s name to LG Polymers India Pvt Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/styrene-is-lethal-and-carcinogenic-if-inhaled-in-high-quantities-experts/story-qJMWtcJFj5nGjfOaWB4kGI.html
07-05-2020||India||Club musicians turn vegetable sellers in lockdown-hit Bengal town||The raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak has overnight turned Siliguri-based professional musicians Rahul Sarkar and Prashant Mitra into vegetable vendors to make their both ends meet.The duo has been going around door-to-door with bicycles laden with vegetables and fruits, a career option, which wasn’t in their wildest nightmares when they had left their homes in North 24 Parganas district’s Jagaddal three years ago and came to Siliguri, located about 500 kilometres away, to try their luck as professional musicians.Sarkar (33) started playing the drums, while Mitra (48) hit the keyboards for bands at a couple of bars in Siliguri. They made Rs 700 each daily for their evening gigs, accompanied by a dash of glamour and some fame among the club circles in the Darjeeling district.However, the nationwide lockdown restrictions, which were initially enforced for 21 days from March 25 and then further extended for another 19 days till May 3 to contain the spread of Covid-19, have changed their lives upside down. Sarkar and Mitra, who have been friends since their struggling days at Jagaddal, are busy carting vegetables and fruits on their bicycles all day to fend for their families and also send some money back home.“I never thought I would be selling vegetables and fruits, but right now this is all I can do to take care of my family,” said Sarkar.“The outbreak has taught me a lesson. I’ve learnt to accept the harsh reality. One should not hallucinate about life,” said Mitra, whose father lives with his sister in neighbouring Assam.Sarkar’s son, who has started going to playschool, wife and father live in Jagaddal, while Mitra lives with his wife in Siliguri. The stage, the duo says, has become a distant dream, as the bars have been closed for an indefinite period following the state government’s order. Sarkar and Mitra received some help in cash and kind from well-wishers and the North Bengal Stage Performers’ Association (NBSPA) that was formed on April 6 to help members in distress. The money helped Sarkar and Mitra start the vegetable business, but it was barely enough to buy two weighing scales. The friends, bound by a common fate, decided to work together as makeshift vegetable vendors to tide over the acute financial crunch.“Most of our colleagues are in dire straits. Our jobs will be of least priority even after the bar reopens,” said Mitra.Around one thousand musicians, dancers, singers and anchors were working in the 50-odd bars in Siliguri, the biggest town and business centre in north Bengal, before the lockdown was clamped.“These people enjoy no social security, as they’re treated like daily-wage earners,” said Deep Chattopadhyay, secretary, NBSPA.“We formed the association to help ourselves. Our means are limited. We need support from the state government,” said Chattopadhyay, a saxophone player and an English teacher at a local high school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/club-musicians-turn-vegetable-sellers-in-lockdown-hit-bengal-town/story-k7WigoZ7EnQGFqHLxHAEyK.html
07-05-2020||India||About one-third of road accident victims during lockdown are migrants: NGO||Nearly a third of road accidents to have taken place during the lockdown prompted by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India have claimed the lives of migrant workers walking back home, according to data collected by Save Life Foundation. India recorded about 600 road crashes in the first two phases of the lockdown, said the data compiled for the period from March 24 (the day India announced the lockdown) till May 3 (the day the second phase of the curbs ended). The highest number of road accidents took place in Punjab (42), followed by Kerala (26) and Delhi (18).Of the total 137 victims in this period, 42 were migrants, 78 were “driving during the lockdown”, and 13 were essential workers. Nine states, namely Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Assam, Kerala, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Punjab and Tamil Nadu, recorded over 100 of these fatalities.“While there has been a dip in the absolute number of road crash fatalities during lockdown due to suspension of public transport and general mobility, the rate of deaths in road crashes has remained unchanged, highlighting how unsafe Indian roads are even when the majority of the country has been under restrictions,” said the NGO, which works to ensure road safety practices.“At least 580 crashes, resulting in 137 deaths have taken place over the last 41 days,” Piyush Tewari, who founded the Save Life Foundation, said. “This is the minimum number as cases with single fatalities may not have been documented properly.”According to Tewari, while the number of fatalities was lower, the crash severity rate of the accidents has remained constant. “Under normal circumstances, we would have seen approximately 16,000 deaths from around 65,000 crashes. The crash severity ratio, around 1:4, comes down to the same as the cases at present.”“The crash severity ratio staying constant just tells us how dangerous the roads are,” Tewari said.Vijay Chibber, a former secretary in the ministry of road transport and highways, said a host of factors plays out in a road accident. “The crash severity proportion stays about the same if there are defects in road engineering, or if visibility is not good in an area,” Chibber said. “Such a road will remain accident-prone whether 50,000 vehicles or 30,000 cars are driving on it.”“Engineering defects can induce accident as can bad drivers,” Chibber added. “While the volume of traffic may have fallen during lockdown, other factors may have remained constant.” These factors, said Chibber, are considered “black spots”. “Accidents during the lockdown can be an indication of a poor quality of vehicles, drivers and of roads.” “Our highways are not access controlled, migrants walking on the roads or on a cycle may not be visible, especially at dawn or dusk. Hordes of people walking home may have aggravated the situation causing the accidents,” said Chibber. Road accidents claimed nearly 150,000 lives, according to the ministry of road transport and highways data for 2018. India is a signatory to the United Nation’s Brasilia Declaration with the target of reducing road fatalities by 50% by 2020.On March 16, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said in the Rajya Sabha accidents across the country have reduced by nearly 10% ever since the Motor Vehicles Act was amended in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/about-one-third-of-road-accident-victims-during-lockdown-are-migrants-ngo/story-AjbwTJ8GjjkFWlg0MgnCqN.html

The leakage of styrene gas, which causes nausea and dizziness, took place early on Thursday when the plant was preparing to resume production later today in view of the eased Covid-19 lockdown restrictions.In the villages closest to the plant located on the outskirts of the city, visuals on social media early this morning showed people lying motionless on the streets, at least two had fallen into the drains.Elsewhere also, there were videos of parents carrying unconscious children in their arms on the streets and running to get medical help. Many others were seen dazed sitting on the pavements. Some more lay on the roads, a young woman among them was seen collapsing.The municipal corporation tweeted that people in an area within approximately 3-kilometre radius of the plant were vulnerable.The incident evoked memories of the gas leaked from a pesticide plant in Madhya Pradesh’s Bhopal in 1984. That incident, counted among one of the world’s worst industrial disasters, had killed 3,500 people.In Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi dialled Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and promised all the help that he would need. Jagan Mohan Reddy left Visakhapatnam soon after.PM Modi also called a meeting of the National Disaster Management Authority that he leads. “I pray for everyone’s safety and well-being in Visakhapatnam,” PM Modi said in a tweet before the meeting started.According to news agency ANI, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) chief SN Pradhan said about 1,000 to 1,500 people had been evacuated by the authorities and more than 800 taken to hospital.Most of the people taken to hospital were later discharged.Visakhapatnam District Medical and Health Officer Tirumala Rao told reporters, around 2 pm that 300 people were still admitted to various hospitals.Late afternoon, Pradhan told a news briefing in Delhi that 11 people had died in the incident.Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy has announced Rs 1 crore compensation for the next of kin of the dead besides Rs 10 lakh to people who have been put on ventilator and Rs 25,000 to those who were treated as outpatients. The chief minister also announced that a committee has been set up to probe the incident and the government was prepared to have the company shift to a different location if recommended by the panel.Gas leaked at 2.30-3 amThe gas leak is reported to have been spotted around between 2.30am and 3 am at LG Polymers India Pvt Ltd facility at RR Venkatapuram area near Gopalapatnam.Assistant commissioner of police Swaroopa Rani said many people who woke up to the pungent smell of the gas ran out. Many, mostly children and old people, fainted at home. Police teams that went to the villages initially had to retreat for fear of being poisoned.Andhra industries minister M Goutham Reddy said styrene gas appeared to have leaked from the storage tank of the plant. It seems the cap of the storage tank came off and by the time the engineers sealed the gap and neutralised the liquid, the damage was done.The company had been told to adhere to all safety protocols before reopening the plant after lockdown relaxations. “It is for the company to prove that there was no negligence on its part,” Reddy said.South Korea-headquartered LG Chem said operations at the plant had been suspended because of a nationwide lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus outbreak and was preparing to resume operations.“We are currently assessing the extent of the damage on residents in the town and are taking all necessary measures to protect residents and employees in collaboration with related organizations,” LG Chem, the owner of LG Polymers, said in a statement, according to news agency Reuters.It said the spokesman separately said a night shift maintenance worker had discovered the leak from a tank. The cause of the leak is being investigated, the spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/9-die-300-hospitalised-in-vizag-after-styrene-gas-leaks-from-polymer-factory/story-QAYTx6Xr9zEN8CgLZvRMWP.html
07-05-2020||India||Road developers to incur Rs 3,700 crore revenue losses during March-June: Report||Highway developers and toll operators are likely to incur toll revenue losses of about Rs 3,700 crore during March-June this year, while NHAI will lose Rs 2,200 crore in toll fee, Crisil Research said on Thursday.However, it said that the road and highways sector would rebound faster despite sharp losses this quarter.“On its part, the roads and highways sector will see developers/ toll operators incurring toll revenue losses of Rs 3,450-3,700 crore during March-June, the estimate suggests. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will lose Rs 2,100-2,200 crore in toll over this period,” Crisil Infrastructure Advisory said during a tele-conference on “Impact of the Pandemic on the Transport Sector and Mitigants thereof”.It said the extended lockdown to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, which has stalled traffic on the ground as in the air, is expected to heap enormous losses on infrastructure industries but roads and highways would rebound faster despite sharp losses this quarter.The agency said NHAI had planned to raise Rs 80,000-85,000 crore through fiscal 2025 by monetising 6,000 km of operational public-funded toll roads.“This asset monetisation programme through toll-operate-transfer and infrastructure investment trusts will likely take a hit,” Crisil said. In addition to the loss in toll revenue, stakeholders will suffer losses on account of accrued interest, increase in costs of under-construction projects, time overruns, and rise in disputes between private sector and the government authorities.“Tolling operations resumed on April 20 and construction on select projects has also restarted. Going forward, the ramp-up in traffic, availability of labour and raw materials for construction, and expeditious dispute resolution will be the key monitorables. “In addition, road authorities such as the NHAI will have to step up initiatives beyond conventional avenues such as development of way-side amenities and formation of special purpose vehicles/ joint ventures for both, financing and revenues,” Akshay Purkayastha, Director, Transport & Logistics, Crisil Infrastructure Advisory, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/road-developers-to-incur-rs-3-700-crore-revenue-losses-during-march-june-report/story-eO9mZHI3iSGwqoh1qkCQWL.html

We will seek explanation from the airline (private operator) as to how it happened. BOI (Bureau of Immigration) has a very stringent protocol for dealing with such deviations, which must have been acted upon,” said a senior official of aviation regulator DGCA.It is not clear if the businessman and his cook were deported or sent to a quarantine facility within India.India has been under a lockdown since March 25 to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. All scheduled commercial passenger flights have been suspended during the lockdown.However, cargo flights, medical evacuation flights and special flights permitted by Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) have been allowed to operate during this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-opens-bookings-for-foreigners-visa-holders-on-outbound-repatriation-flights/story-ElPSbnKlR4WuysO0y6lNKI.html
07-05-2020||India||Jaipur focuses on ‘super spreaders’ to contain Covid-19 infections||Rajasthan has now turned its focus on ‘super spreaders’ to contain Covid-19 infections in Jaipur, a top government official said Thursday.According to the government data, out of the 33 districts in Rajasthan, Jaipur has the maximum of 1,099 Covid-19 cases. Till date around 30,761 samples have been taken in Jaipur and 52 of Covid-19 patients in the district have died.After finding over 10 positive cases of super spreaders (fruit and vegetable vendors) in the city recently, the district administration has aggressively started taking random samples.“Our major focus is now on super spreaders such as vegetable vendors, dairy booths, grocery and medical shops – these are the direct points of interaction. Many incidents in past few days have come up where the vegetable vendor had spread the infection,” said Ajitabh Sharma, Principal Secretary, department of energy and nodal officer for Jaipur.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.Contact tracing is difficult in such cases because vendors are mobile, he added.“Aggressive random sampling has been started to check super spreaders with vegetable vendors being the first to be checked since they are mobile. Subsequently, we will cover dairy booths, grocery and medical shops which are stationary,” Sharma said.He said there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of fruit and vegetable sellers after many people who were in other trades also started selling fruits and vegetables.The officer said that there is a higher risk of infection since a large number of people come in contact with the vendors who have no fixed routes and which makes contact tracing difficult if a positive case is found among them. Over 150 first contacts of super spreaders have been quarantined. The administration has now devised a way to monitor the vendors.“In view of this, the number of vendors has been limited for every ward and they have to wear caps issued by Municipal Corporation, wear masks and carry sanitizer,” he said.“The number of vendors has also been limited across the city to 10 in each ward. To distinguish them, caps of different colours have been given to vendors permitted in inner and outer walled city. Out of around 3,000 vendors 1,050 are now permitted to sell. Those selling inside the walled city will wear multi-coloured cap and those outside will wear white,” he said.A separate team of doctors are testing them and monitoring them. Chief Medical and Health Officer, Narrottam Sharma said till date around 1,200 samples of super spreaders such as vegetable vendor and grocery store people have been taken and a dozen of them have tested positive.Amid the increasing number of cases, the ‘positive’ news is that out of the total 1099 Covid-19 cases in Jaipur, 604 have recovered and 461 have been discharged. The number of active cases is now 443.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaipur-focuses-on-super-spreaders-to-contain-covid-19-infections/story-2QWj6ImuyacoBPvmNO5LaM.html

We are mentioning Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad in the bulletin as they are the parts of India,” news agency ANI quoted IMD Director General Mrutyunjoy Mohapatra as saying.“For a long time, IMD has been issuing severe weather forecast for Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal etc. We were mentioning this information in our national bulletin. For past two days, we have started mentioning this information in our regional bulletin,” ANI quoted Mohapatra as further saying.Mohapatra said they have been mentioning areas under PoK under its daily weather bulletin ever since the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir in the two union territories in August last year, news agency PTI reported.These cities of PoK have now found a place in the overall forecast of the northwest division. The IMD’s northwest division consists of nine sub-divisions: Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi-Chandigarh-Haryana, Punjab, east Uttar Pradesh, west Uttar Pradesh, east Rajasthan and west Rajasthan.The development assumes significance as New Delhi has been of a position that the PoK belongs to India.The inclusion of Muzaffarabad and Gilgit-Baltistan in the forecast comes amid Pakistan’s Supreme Court allowing elections in Gilgit-Baltistan this week. India had strongly reacted to the development.A senior Pakistani diplomat was served a “demarche”, or formal diplomatic representation over telephone, to lodge India’s strong protest against the Pakistani Supreme Court’s order.Mohapatra said that the IMD, being the World Meteorological Department nominated Regional Meteorological Centre, provides severe weather warnings to Pakistan, Afghanistan, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan detailing forecasts for the next five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/areas-in-pakistan-occupied-kashmir-now-in-weather-department-forecast/story-vpnunRAqwvnYFubyxTfJyJ.html

India, China in lead||The UN on Thursday projected a sharp rise in global birth rates, led by India, in the months since WHO declared coronavirus a pandemic, triggering lockdowns. “The pandemic could strain healthcare capacities for mothers and newborns,” it said.“An estimated 116 million babies will be born under the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic,” the Unicef said in a report. This represents a spike for the period assessed. “New mothers and newborns will be greeted by harsh realities.” India, with 20.1 million births, tops nations with the anticipated highest numbers of births in the nine months since the pandemic’s declaration, the UN body said. Following India will be countries, such as China (13.5 million births), Nigeria (6.4 million), Pakistan (5 million) and Indonesia (4 million). “COVID-19 containment measures can disrupt life-saving health services such as childbirth care, putting millions of pregnant mothers and their babies at great risk,” Unicef’s executive director Henrietta Fore said in the global report. Developing countries are especially at risk, she said.The UN body made projections for a 40-week period between March 11 and December 16 2020 in its estimate based upon the WHO’s March 11 assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.India has made considerable progress in social indicators, but still lags many countries in indices such as maternal health, access to contraception and immunisation. According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), the prevalence rate of anaemia among Indian women has witnessed just a speck of minor improvement from 55% in 2005-06 to 53% in 2015-16. The UN body said most of the countries which will witness a baby boom (including India) had “high neonatal mortality rates” even before the pandemic and “may see these levels increase with COVID-19 conditions”.“That’s very true. Family welfare has got a big knock down. Access to birth-control measures during the lockdown has been scarce. There is a high possibility of unprotected sex among spouses. Adequate resources must be reserved for a birth boom,” said Dr. Sushil Sharma, a public health expert and chairman of the Arthritis Foundation of India. According to Purushottam M. Kulkarni of Jawaharlal Nehru University, data from the NHFS shows that between 2005-06 and 2015-16 (NFHS-4), there has been little improvement in access to contraception, indicating unmet contraception. Unmet need for contraception is measured as the share of women who are fertile and want to postpone their next birth or stop childbearing altogether but don’t have access to contraception. Even wealthier countries are affected by this crisis, the UN body said. “In the US, the sixth highest country in terms of expected number of births, over 3.3 million babies are projected to be born between March 11 and December 16. In New York, authorities are looking into alternative birthing centers as many pregnant women are worried about giving birth in hospitals.”Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 2.8 million pregnant women and newborns died every year, or 1 every 11 seconds, mostly of preventable causes, data from WHO show. The UN body called for allocating dedicated resources to lifesaving services and supplies for maternal and child health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-sees-global-baby-boom-due-to-covid-19-lockdowns-india-china-in-lead/story-ViCK1y4Vff5fIGSVQLA9CM.html

07-05-2020||India||Bengal’s retail and hospitality sectors plan new models to sidestep Covid-19 crisis||With business virtually at standstill, retail and hospitality industries have planned new models to keep going in a controlled environment during and after the lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus.The Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI) has prepared a standard operating procedure (SOP) and approached the administrations in several states, including West Bengal, seeking resumption of operation with limited manpower and restricted entry of shoppers. The industry provides livelihood for 12 million people across India.“The retail industry contributes over 10% to India’s gross domestic product (GDP), the second largest after agriculture. It employs over 8% of the overall workforce making it the third largest in the country,” Amitabh Taneja, chairman and founding director, SCAI, said in a summary to the SOP that was sent to chief minister Mamata Banerjee on May 1 along with his letter.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.The SOP mandates, among many other things, 50 per cent occupancy of common areas and gross leasable areas, distance of five feet between customers at eating outlets, Installation of plexiglass at checkout points, 50 per cent use of parking capacity, restricted washroom usage, no promotional activity and sensor-based sanitization points at entry and inside stores and outlets. State government officials were not willing to comment but a senior bureaucrat said that SCAI representatives were told that the government would wait for the Centre to take a call on opening malls.“It will take India quite some time to turn into a green zone. Shopping centres and malls cannot be shut down till then because billions of lives depend on the manufacturing industry which has taken a hit. If the government can allow offices and airports to operate with limited staff, something can be tried at malls as well. Look at the streets. I am quite sure there would have been complete order at liquor stores in the malls had they been allowed to open,” Rahul Saraf, managing director of Kolkata-based Forum Group and director SCAI, told HT.“A mall provides a formal and regulated environment. One should not wait for normalcy to return,” he added. The amount of business in a mall works out to be around Rs 10,000 per square feet a year and the space used for business in some of the big malls in and around Kolkata adds up to around five million square feet, said Saraf.“Let there be caveats but thousands of frontline and back-end workers should be allowed to earn their livelihood,” he added. With the number of Covid cases on the rise, the hospitality industry in Bengal is going through an equally rough time and many are trying to work out new models.Rishi Jain, executive director, Jain Group, which owns Holiday Inn Kolkata Airport, has started renting out the top floor of the property to people looking for a quarantine facility that is more hospitable than a government building.“Entry and exit to the top floor are not used by other guests and the floor below it is kept empty to act as a buffer zone. Only disposable utensils and containers are used in the top floor,” said Jain.“In our hotel, retail selling has come to a zero with no one coming in to have lunch or dinner or ordering food from home. Luckily we have some guests of foreign origin and supply of raw materials is unaffected till now. We are operating with 30 per cent staff strength,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-s-retail-and-hospitality-sectors-plan-new-models-to-sidestep-covid-19-crisis/story-y8L83Ob8XvubK5Zwr6D5aM.html

Nine people were killed in the gas leak.“I personally helped more than 15 people get to an ambulance who had tried to run away from the village but dropped down a few metres away,” Local revenue official B V Rani told news agency Reuters.Areas within an approximately 3-kilometre radius of the plant were vulnerable, the municipal corporation said in a tweet. Around 1,500 people had been evacuated, mostly from a neighbouring village, authorities said.The scenes were reminiscent of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster which killed thousands of people. At least 30 tonnes of methyl isocyanate gas was released from the Union Carbide pesticide plant in the Madhya Pradesh capital in one of the worst industrial disasters of the 20th century.The incident occurred on the intervening night of December 2-3, 1984, and affected more than 6,00,000 workers and nearby inhabitants.Scores of people had left their homes in a hurry as gas started to spread. It mostly affected the low-lying areas of the city and led to decay of vegetables, fruits and other eatables.Doctors said the most common immediate health issues were severe lung injury, often resulting in death, and corneal damage. Many lost their eyesight.One of the most common long-term impact has been fibrosis of the lung and respiratory crippling, said doctors. A Belstein Test conducted in 2015 found the water from 240-foot-deep borewells in Bhopal to be contaminated due to the gas leak referred to many as Hiroshima-like tragedy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vizag-gas-leak-an-eerie-reminder-of-bhopal-gas-tragedy/story-PTCBZv5Me1Y2crMHtVbeNN.html
07-05-2020||India||Ministry website crashes as Indians abroad rush to register to get home||The Indian civil aviation ministry’s website crashed on Wednesday as panicked citizens abroad rushed to register for a repatriation of almost 15,000 nationals from 12 countries on planes and naval ships.India banned all incoming international flights in late March as it imposed one of the world’s strictest virus lockdowns, leaving hundreds of thousands of workers and students stranded abroad.Under the first phase of the mass effort announced on Tuesday, two ships were heading towards the Maldives to evacuate some 1,000 Indian citizens while another was headed for the Gulf.The first of 64 flights over the first week was due to leave the United Arab Emirates -- home to more than three million Indians -- on Thursday.A flight from Qatar for the southern state of Kerala originally scheduled for Thursday was postponed to Saturday, local media reported. No reason was given.In total 26 flights will bring Indians home from the Gulf region, while others will operate from Southeast Asia, Britain and the United States.Indian media quoted civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri as saying that 200,000 Indians abroad had registered for repatriation and that the final number could be twice that.His ministry blamed the crashing of its website on “unprecedented traffic” and urged people to check the website of Air India, which is operating the flights, for details.Kerala is the biggest source of Indians in the Gulf.OV Mustafa, the director of Norka Roots, a government welfare body for non-resident Keralites, told AFP that those abroad were “desperate” and in a “panic”.The Indian embassy in Abu Dhabi said on Twitter that all passengers would be screened for virus symptoms and given an antibody test at the departure airport.There were also concerns about social distancing on the flights, with the Times of India quoting Puri as saying that keeping middle seats vacant on the aircraft was not viable.The Indian embassy statement said that passengers would be given masks, gloves and sanitisers to wear and use on board.Upon arrival, passengers are set to be quarantined for a minimum of 14 days, presenting a large challenge to already stretched Indian authorities.Kerala’s chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the state was “fully prepared” and that “all arrangements are in place for testing and quarantining”.In the first five days, 2,250 people are expected to land at the state’s airports in Kochi, Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram. Kochi port was also set to receive all three ships.Vijayan said that 442,000 people wanted to come back to Kerala, and that the central government had “only” approved the return of 80,000.‘Only for the rich’The government has come under fire because those being flown back have to pay, with prices reportedly ranging from 12,000 rupees ($160) for a ticket from Dubai to 100,000 rupees to fly back from the United States.A huge number of Indians who work abroad do menial work and have been left jobless by the pandemic shutdown.The oil-rich Gulf is reliant on the cheap labour of millions of foreigners -- mostly from South Asia -- many of whom live in squalid camps far from the region’s skyscrapers and malls.Prominent Indian opposition politician Shashi Tharoor said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that many could “ill afford” to bear the costs.A. Jemford, who works for the non-profit Agaram Foundation in Tamil Nadu state, tweeted that the repatriation effort was “only for the rich”.One Indian man in Sharjah in the UAE whose wife is six months pregnant told AFP that he registered with the consulate last week but has heard nothing since.“I don’t have medical insurance to cover the delivery costs here so I wanted to get her back home to Kerala to her parents. And she has complications in her pregnancy,” said the man, who did not wish to be named.“It’s been a week and we haven’t heard anything,” he said, adding he could only “sit and pray to my God.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministry-website-crashes-as-citizens-abroad-rush-to-register-to-get-home/story-KK4ebnLxaODCiYwiYijfQO.html

The minister said styrene in liquid form was stored in the tank and it would take gaseous form at a temperature of more than 20 degrees Celsius. “The cap of the storage tank is learnt to have come off and by the time the engineers sealed the gap and neutralised the liquid, the damage was done,” he stated.He said the company was asked to adhere to all safety protocols before reopening the plant after lockdown relaxations. “It is for the company to prove that there was no negligence on its part,” Reddy said, adding that none of the company’s employees died of the gas leakage.Watch | Vizag gas leak: PM Modi holds meet with NDMA; gas neutralized | Key details“As of now, the death of eight people has been confirmed.

The DCs may need to take the help of local clubs and village authorities to prepare the food.The cabinet has decided to open wholesale markets, which were closed during the nationwide lockdown restrictions, which were initially imposed for 21 days from March 25 and then further extended for another 19 days till May 3, on all days except Sunday.Last Saturday, 92 people from Manipur were brought back from Guwahati and Mizoram. Now, lawmakers from various constituencies have started sending vehicles to neighbouring states in the north-east to repatriate other stranded people from Manipur after taking permission from authorities concerned.CM Singh, in a video message to the public, has appealed to extend cooperation to the state government’s initiatives to tackle the pandemic.Manipur has zero active Covid-19 positive cases after both the patients, who were found infected with SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, on March 24 and April 2, respectively. Later, they were discharged from hospital on April 12 and 21, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-govt-to-bear-train-fare-of-manipuris-stranded-outside-northeast-region/story-cz6lccmDAlLk7Sm31vs52J.html

More than 1,000 people fell sick after inhaling the poisonous Styrene gas leaked from the plant.The Styrene gas affects the central nervous system, throat, skin, eyes and some other parts of the body, NDRF Director General S N Pradhan said. Styrene is highly flammable and releases a poisonous gas when burnt.The gas can cause nausea and dizziness when inhaled, and experts say that person exposed to the gas should be given medical treatment immediately. Also Watch | At least 8 dead, several sick after gas leak at Andhra Pradesh factoryAccording to US National Library of Medicine, Styrene is used to make polystyrene plastics, fiberglass, rubber, and latex in its liquid form. It occurs naturally in some fruits, vegetables, meats, nuts, and beverages in low levels.Styrene is used to make insulation, pipes, automobile parts, printing cartridges and copy machine toner, food containers, packaging material, carpet backing, luggage, shoes, toys, floor waxes and polishes, according to US National Library of Medicine. Cigarette smoke and vehicle exhaust too contain styrene.The plant in Andhra Pradesh is owned by South Korean battery maker LG Chemical Ltd, and is located around 14 kilometers away from Visakhapatnam city.LG Chem, South Korea’s top petrochemical maker by capacity, took over the facility previously owned by Hindustan Polymers and renamed it as LG Polymers India Private Limited (LGPI) in July, 1997, according to a company website.The LG Polymers plant makes polystyrene products, according to a company website, which are used in manufacturing electric fan blades, cups and cutlery and containers for cosmetic products such as make up.Emergency services evacuated hundreds of people from nearby areas where the plant is situated, a police official in Andhra Pradesh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-styrene-the-gas-that-leaked-from-visakhapatnam-plant-and-killed-8/story-jJ85G6EOw5Ezzz2U2HEP9M.html

As many as 8,439 test reports were said to be awaited from laboratories till then.Interestingly, the April 26 bulletin was immediately followed by another bulletin in which the number of cumulative samples was missing and so was the number of reports awaited. The second bulletin had components like the total number of sample reports, positive cases and negative reports only but there were huge discrepancies between the figures on these components as mentioned in both reports.The number of sample reports dipped by 5,000. There was also a huge gap of 9,000 between negative/rejected samples number as mentioned in the first report and negative reports as mentioned in the second one.As per the information obtained from districts on Wednesday, as many as 10,899 samples were taken in Indore, one of the Covid-19 hotspots in the country. The district reported 1,654 patients and 79 deaths till Tuesday.In Ujjain, another hotspot in the state, 3,522 samples were collected so far; in capital Bhopal, the number is about 15,000.While the state government continues to remain silent, health experts say it is only with a high number of testing and transparency in the government’s conduct that the battle against Covid-19 can be won.Last Saturday, the number of people tested in the country for Covid-19 crossed a million.In a joint letter to health secretary and director-general of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), public health experts Dr Biswaroop Chatterjee, Amulya Nidhi and SR Azad said, “Madhya Pradesh is testing lesser compared to other badly hit states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and Rajasthan.”“As of May 5, the state has done a total number of 54,595 tests which translates to about 602 tests per million whereas Maharashtra has conducted 1,628 tests per million with total 18,2884 tests so far. In Gujarat, Delhi and Rajasthan the tests per million stand at 1,483, 4,162 and 1,970 respectively,” they said in the letter.They addedc, “It is a matter of deep concern that April 27 onwards, the state government stopped providing data on total samples and pending test results. Given that almost 1.5 months have passed since the first case was found and cases are constantly increasing the state still has only 10 government testing labs and three private labs.”“The Covid-19 situation has worsened fast in Madhya Pradesh with a total of 3,049 reported positive cases and 176 deaths as of May 5. The state’s fatality rate is 5.77% against the national 3.42% and its test positivity rate is 5.58% against the national average of 3.87 per cent,” the experts said.The letter underlines an immediate need to increase tests, take corrective action without any further delay and adopt a people-centric, transparent and efficient testing strategy in place by setting up more labs, create a strong supply chain for acquiring testing kits, doing more tests and share data transparently with the public.When contacted, additional chief secretary, Health department Mohd Suleman said, “Government of India has decided that only ICMR test data is recognised. So we are only considering the data given by ICMR recognised testing labs. That is included in the bulletin. Labs don’t accept samples which are not as per the ICMR protocol. So the collected samples don’t get tested if they are not in line with protocol.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-hard-hit-by-covid-19-has-no-info-on-samples-for-10-days-experts-concerned/story-nP4g32F8uIq8guZMNvYACI.html

CBI is the nodal agency - or National Central Bureau (NCB) - for Interpol in India.“It is crucial that police officers don’t lose the grip over other crimes due to duties during Covid-19 pandemic, hence this digital learning platform has been created,” said one of the officials cited above. The virtual academy will have over 100 self-paced courses and modules for the law enforcement agencies. According to a statement by Interpol, the virtual academy complements its physical “Global Academy” for 194-member countries.The Global Academy is a network of trusted law enforcement education institutions providing a global approach to law enforcement training, through both face-to-face and distance learning on Interpol tools and services, as well as transnational crime topicsIn a statement, Interpol Secretary General Jürgen Stock said, “The Covid-19 pandemic is forcing law enforcement to learn precious lessons, and fast, in a changed international security environment.”“However, whilst we are seeing significant growth in certain crimes areas linked to Covid-19 such as fraud and cyber crime, police still have to deal with all forms of transnational crime and terrorism. The Virtual Academy provides a wide range of courses which are essential in helping law enforcement in their daily work and learn from world class training professionals,” he added. In 2019, more than 15,000 online training courses were completed by global law enforcement, complementing its face-to-face sessions which reached around 5,000 officers from across the globe. These sessions ranged from topics such as counter-terrorism and cybercrime, to training on leadership for women in law enforcement and human rights in policing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-interpol-s-virtual-academy-for-learning-during-covid-19-cbi-tells-state-police-departments/story-p6rPdvLnaqNVawQZWhwBKI.html

As far as vaccines are concerned, experts said these will take at least a year to be developed.The Compendium was launched by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research which has information on 200 Covid-19 technologies, ongoing research and technologies already available for commercialisation. Most of these technologies are proof-of-concept (POC) tested and can help the entrepreneurs to take the product to market faster as they do not have to reinvent the wheel, a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology said.Among ongoing research on Covid-19 treatments is raw materials for covid 19 drug being developed by National Chemical Laboratory which will soon be handed over to Department of Pharmaceuticals. Deployable hospital is already in development stage. Modulus a start up in Indian Institute of Technology, Madras research park which has signed an MoU with Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Trivandrum for developing the technology.Zydus Cadila which is developing the viral membrane protein vaccine also has a second vaccine approach dealing with development of a live attenuated recombinant measles virus vectored vaccine against Covid-19. Bharat Biotech is developing an intranasal vaccine called ‘CoroFlu’ which after clinical trials, the company is likely to produce around 300 million doses of vaccine for global distribution according to the compendium. Indian Immunologicals Limited is also developing a live attenuated severe acute respiratory syndrome vaccine which has been found to be effective in Golden Syrian Hamsters. “The technology looks promising for developing a vaccine for prophylactic, active, single dose immunization against coronavirus in humans, with an enhanced safety profile,” the compendium states. Serum Institute of India in collaboration with US-based Codagenix is developing a vaccine which is now in animal testing phase.“The DNA vaccine involves giving a DNA which will produce certain proteins which will help protect against the infection. No antigen will be given. The second measles virus vectored vaccine against covid 19 is nothing but a recombinant vaccine which will have a combination of measles RNA with SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA put into the measles virus. We already know the measles vaccine is effective.,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of virology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. “The Serum Institute vaccine is also a recombinant vaccine. I am not aware of the details of other vaccines being developed. As far as I know these are all in development stage. They will go through pre-clinical trials in animals and then phase 1 trials in humans for safety and then phase 2 and 3. Trials may be expedited but normally it takes more than a year for all these processes,” added Dr Broor.Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) is developing isolation pods for Covid-19 patients to help them travel safely. A cover is attached with a pod that restricts the patient from having contact with others. The over will be completely sterilized. A light bed is also arranged on the isolation pod according to ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isolation-pods-deployable-hospitals-antibody-gel-among-treatments-being-developed-in-india/story-gkEaXDrUMedyJDV7xI4gbO.html

07-05-2020||India||Taliban-linked Haqqani network, not just ISKP, plotted Kabul gurdwara strike: NDS||Afghan security forces have taken down a centre operated jointly by terror groups Haqqani Network and the so-called Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) that was responsible for bloody attacks including one on Kabul’s gurdwara that killed 28 worshippers on March 25, a statement by the National Directorate of Security, or NDS, said has said.Five terrorists were killed and eight arrested when commando teams attached with Afghanistan’s lead intelligence agency raided two hideouts of the group in and around Kabul, the NDS said.The statement implies that the two Pakistan proxies in Afghanistan - Aslam Farooqui led ISKP and the Taliban deputy leader Sirajuddin Haqqani-led Haqqani network - which had often targeted each other in the past had taken some steps to work together.This contrasts with Aslam Farooqui’s claim in the early part of his interrogation that his fighters had been on the run under pressure from the Taliban and had been mostly limited to a eastern Afghanistan district.Farooqi was arrested by the NDS last month in raids carried out weeks after four gunmen stormed Guru Har Rai Gurdwara in Kabul’s old city and opened fire from automatic weapons on March 25. According to the police, 28 worshippers were killed in this attack on the Sikh shrine that had drawn sharp condemnation.But Wednesday’s statement by the NDS fits with New Delhi’s assessment that the attack on the gurdwara was ordered by the Taliban at the behest of Pakistani deep state with the larger motive of driving out India from Afghanistan. There are intelligence reports with national security planners in New Delhi that the Taliban, which had stepped up attacks on Afghan security forces after the United States signed a troop withdrawal agreement on February 29, could carry out more attacks on Indian interests and religious minorities.The NDS said the joint centre destroyed by its forces was controlled by Sanaullah, who was responsible for recruitment for the ISKP and was the urban coordinator of Haqqani Network in Kabul.It also held this joint cell responsible for the rocket attacks in March on the inauguration ceremony of President Ashraf Ghani and the Bagram air base, the US military’s largest base in Afghanistan. No one was killed in either attack. But 30 people were killed when rockets landed in the Shahid Mazari Mosque where many members of the ethnic Hazara community had gathered to mark the anniversary of the death of a Hazara leader. According to the NDS, this attack was executed by the joint cell.To be sure, the Taliban has countered the NDS findings, describing it as propaganda. “We have no joint base with ISIS but have fought and eliminated them from the country,” the Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted.Kabul watchers in Delhi attribute the Taliban’s rushed denial to the basic principle in the US-Taliban pact that the Taliban would not allow groups such as the ISKP to use Afghan soil to plan attacks against the US and its allies.An arrangement between the Taliban-linked Haqqani network and the ISKP implies that even if the Taliban agrees to end violence, it could use other groups such as Aslam Farooqui’s ISKP to keep sending the rockets via its allies.Afghan officials have accused the Haqqani network, a US-designated terror group, of carrying out major attacks claimed by or blamed on IS-K. The March 25 attack on the gurdwara was one such case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taliban-linked-haqqani-network-not-just-iskp-plotted-kabul-gurdwara-strike-nds/story-iHf776W3zeVtc3CrNnWUTJ.html
07-05-2020||India||Govt extends time for public comments on environment impact regulation||The Union environment ministry has decided to extend the window for submitting public comments to the draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification till June 30. Several environmental groups and the Opposition have been demanding that the time period for public comments, which expires on May 22, be extended.The draft EIA notification 2020 which is expected to significantly overhaul the environmental clearance process for all infrastructure projects in the country was issued by the environment ministry on March 23 and almost the entire sixty-day period for public scrutiny of the draft coincided with the lockdown period. The nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25 and has been extended till May 17.Former environment minister and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had tweeted on May 1 that environment minister Prakash Javadekar had put out the draft EIA notification giving 60 days for public comments. “This deadline should be extended by 3 months at least due to covid 19 to enable better understanding of the changes proposed.” BJP MP, Rajeev Chandrasekhar also tweeted saying, “Dear Prakash Javadekar ji please extend 60-day time for comments on draft EIA notification 2020 given Coronavirus crisis. This deserves a good, robust public discussion of changes proposed.”On Thursday, the environment ministry said in a statement: “The ministry is in receipt of several representations for extending the notice period expressing concern that the draft EIA notification was published during the lockdown imposed due to Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore ministry after due consideration deems it fit to extend the notice period up to June 30.”The reason draft EIA 2020 is being seen as important development is because it proposes a number of relaxations for infrastructure projects which have violated the EIA 2006 norms and extends the validity of environmental clearance in various sectors by several years. CK Mishra, secretary, environment, told HT over phone on Wednesday that “the time period for public consultations is likely to be extended till August.”One of the main objectives of the draft is to bring those industries or projects under regulation which have violated the EIA 2006 notification by starting construction work before environmental clearance is granted or by expanding capacity. “Dealing with violation cases” is an entirely new section in the draft notification compared to the EIA notification 2006.The draft states that violations can be reported suo motu by the project proponent, by any government authority or found by the committee appraising such projects. The appraisal committee will assess whether the construction or expansion carried out in violation of the norms can “run sustainably” with “environmental safeguards.” Those that will be regularised will have to pay a late fee for violating norms.“The draft does clarify that closure orders can be issued for any project that are found in violation of the notification. The cognizance is possible if this is found during appraisal of an application. While this is important, it normalizes the occurrence of violations in the first place and is contradictory with the idea of “prior environmental clearance” which is the premise an impact assessment process rests on,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.The draft increases the validity of the environment clearances. The draft provides environment clearance validity for 50 years for mining projects, against 30 years in the present notification; 15 years from river valley projects against 10 years.Project proponents will have to submit environment clearance compliance reports once a year against every six months in the current system. The draft also states that no fresh studies by EAC should be asked for unless “new facts” come to the notice and it becomes “inevitable” to seek additional studies. This completely undermines the public consultation process, as well as the expert inputs of the ministry’s own committees, experts said. The draft can be read on environment ministry’s Parivesh website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-extends-time-for-public-comments-on-environment-impact-regulation/story-DTfA8CWXqa6Z6UyuTjRcyM.html

This happened because several ambulance drivers reportedly refused to enter the village over fear of contracting infection.According to Harekrushna Ojha, a resident of Bainsiria village of Bari block in Jajpur district, hos wife went into labour on Wednesday morning. He called the 108 helpline that manages the Odisha emergency ambulance system to take her to the nearest community health centre 15 km away for delivery. But as soon as the ambulance drivers were told about the village, they refused to pick up the expectant mother, said Ojha.“Soon after my wife complained of labour pains, my younger brother called up 108 helpline for sending an ambulance. But each time, the drivers straightaway refused saying they would enter a Covid-19 village as couple of positive cases were reported from here last month. For over an hour and half not a single ambulance was ready to come,” said Ojha, who sought the help of the sarpanch. However, he too pleaded helplessness in the matter.Finding no other way, Ojha put his wife Kanaklata on a wooden trolley to an ambulance which was waiting about two kilometres away. Ojha’s mother was holding the woman while his brother pulled the trolley.ASHA worker Rina, who had come to assist the pregnant woman, then tried one last time, but the ambulance driver did not enter the village.“We could not lose any time as a woman delivers maximum within an hour of onset of labour. It was risky taking a pregnant woman on a trolley, but we had no other way. The situation was really desparate,” said Rina.District collector Ranjan Das did not comment on the incident. Jajpur has now turned out to be a Covid-19 hotspot in Odisha with 55 positive cases, the highest in the state, followed by Khurda district with 47 cases.On Monday, the fears over Covid-19 had forced a family in Balasore district to bury the head of their family after villagers refused to help them in cremation suspecting that the man had died of the coronavirus disease. Last month, a 60-year-old cancer patient in coastal Odisha town of Balasore had to spend over eight hours outside his rented home after the landlord refused to let him and his family enter the house as he had gone to a hospital in Bhubaneswar, a Covid-19 hotspot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pregnant-woman-taken-on-trolley-family-claims-ambulance-refused-to-enter-village-due-to-covid-19-fear/story-d49RgCRjNaqUVZcInoZsxJ.html
07-05-2020||India||‘Buddha is the symbol of India’s self-realisation’: Top quotes from PM Modi’s Buddha Purnima address||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday linked India’s success with Lord Buddha’s teaching as he addressed a virtual session on Buddha Purnima.He said that India is working in the interest of the world and would continue doing so for the entire humanity.Here are the top quotes from PM Modi’s keynote address:Lord Buddha had said that the mind is supreme, and is the basis of Dhamma, that the mind is at the forefront of all the tendencies. That’s why, since our mids are connected, we don’t feel the lack of physical presence. It’s a pleasure to be amongst you, but the situation now is not conducive. That’s why, be it from afar and through the medium of technology, I got the opportunity to speak to you and I’m happy about that.During this difficult time of coronavirus lockdown, there are several people around us who are working 24 hours to help others, to maintain law and order, to cure infected persons and to maintain cleanliness, by sacrificing their own comforts. All such people deserve appreciation and honour.Today, there is a mood of distress in the world. At this time, teachings of Lord Buddha become all the more relevant. He said that people must continuously strive to overcome difficult situations to wriggle out of them. To stop after getting tired is not any alternative.The four truths given by Lord Buddha namely compassion, mercy, equanimity towards pleasure and pain, and accepting everything as it is have been our constant inspiration. Even today, you can see that without any selfishness and discrimination, India is standing strongly behind anyone on the crisis, in the country and anywhere in the world.This is the reason why many ountries remembered India in these times of crisis and India left no stone unturned in extending help. While making every possible effort to save every countryman, India is also sincerely fulfilling its global obligations.Buddha is the symbol of both realisation of India and self-realisation of India. With this self-realisation, India is working in the interest of the world and would continue doing so for the entire humanity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/buddha-is-the-symbol-of-india-s-self-realisation-top-quotes-from-pm-modi-s-buddha-purnima-address/story-6nrmqln6fzTjhJNd4vjQ5N.html

Since February this year, Air India has been conducting various repatriation flights to virus-affected cities like Wuhan in China and Rome in Italy to bring back Indian nationals. It has also been instrumental in repatriating foreigners to Israel, UK and Germany.What happened 30 year ago:Three decades ago, Air India led a group of airlines which included Indian Airlines and Aeroflot as well as Indian Air Force to rescue an estimated 111,711 Indians from the Gulf, after Iraq invaded Kuwait in the year 1990.The 59-day operation involved 488 flights and was conducted before the first Gulf war. This time, the exercise will encompass flights to the US in the West to Philippines in the East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schedule-flights-evacuation-process-all-you-need-you-know-about-vande-bharat-mission/story-deEpTURRSuBlKaBvTC2ICP.html

Bhardwaj said that each establishment of the BSF is following the standard operating procedures that are in place to contain the coronavirus disease.The central paramilitary forces now have a total of 383 active cases and 13 cured cases across the country and maximum of these active cases are from the CRPF (158), followed by BSF (152), 45 from the ITBP, 15 from the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and 13 cases are from Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).Meanwhile, the force opened the two floors of its headquarters in Delhi on Wednesday, which were sealed on Monday after a driver had tested positive.Around 10 lakh strong border guarding forces are deployed for counter-insurgency, border guarding and law and order duties across the country. The spike in Covid-19 infections in CAPFs in last one week has raised concerns among its brass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/85-more-covid-19-positive-cases-in-bsf-tally-in-forces-nears-400/story-9EX99xdENHrtP3FIDO4pBK.html
07-05-2020||India||In meet with labour ministry, trade unions say ‘cannot hold migrants captive’||Representatives of trade union organisations on Wednesday held a meeting with Union labour minister Santosh Gangwar via video conferencing and appealed against the use of coercion to stop migrants workers from returning to their homes, sought more trains for them to do so amid the Covid-19 crisis and incentives for their return to their host states.“They [workers] should be provided incentives to return to host states such as cash, electronic passes, free train tickets etc. You cannot hold them captive,” said CK Saji Narayanan, the head of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s labour wing, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh. Narayanan’s comments came a day after Karnataka withdrew a request sent to the Railways to provide trains to ferry migrants from the state back to their homes towns. The development came after representatives from the construction industry met chief minister BS Yediyurappa and expressed concerns about labour shortage if the migrants went back. Over 50,000 people had registered to go back to Bihar alone. The Centre has made an exception for the stranded people and allowed them to travel even as inter-state borders remain closed as part of the national lockdown.At the meeting with Gangwar, the BMS opposed the extension of working hours at factories in several states, saying it violated International Labour Organization conventions and labour laws. “Many are fleeing due to lack of proper treatment. Industrial associations, trade unions, government officials and local elected representatives should collectively undertake a campaign to retain labour at the workplaces...,” Narayanan said. He urged the ministry to ask states to stop pay cuts, and frame regulations and guidelines on automation, robotics etc.The All India Trade Union Congress demanded sufficient trains for workers to return to their home states and improvement in ration distribution. “We asked for the implementation of the ministry’s own advisories in regard to payment of wages, no retrenchment...,” AITUC general secretary Amarjeet Kaur said in a statement after the meeting.As per a statement issued by the ministry, Gangwar pointed out that there is a need to find solutions to the challenges for workers. He asked the Central Trade Union Organizations to suggest measures .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-meet-with-labour-ministry-trade-unions-say-cannot-hold-migrants-captive/story-LzvRS5oQRQu3dg47aWNTmL.html
07-05-2020||India||MHA tells Bengal to open Bangladesh access||The Centre on Wednesday came down hard on the Mamata Banerjee government in West Bengal for not allowing movement of goods traffic through border crossings between India and Bangladesh -- a move that it said could jeopardize India’s international commitments to the neighbouring country.In a letter to West Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla stated that “the unilateral action on the part of government of West Bengal to stop the cross land border movement of essential goods would have larger implications for the Indian government with regard to its legally binding international commitments.”Bhalla told that by doing so, West Bengal was not just violating the ministry of home affairs’ orders under Disaster Management Act but also Articles 253, 256 and 257 of the Constitution of India. Article 253 of the Constitution deals with the legislation for giving effect to international agreements while articles 256 and 257 give powers to the Centre for issuing directions to the state.“It has been reported that goods traffic through border crossings between India and Bangladesh, falling in West Bengal, has still not resumed. As a result, a large number of trucks carrying essential supplies, bound for Bangladesh, are stranded at different border crossing points,” the home secretary wrote in his letter.“A number of drivers of such vehicles, while returning from Bangladesh, have also not been allowed to cross the border, and are stranded in Bangladesh,” Bhalla added. He reminded the state government of lockdown measures issued on May 1 according to which no state/union territory shall stop movement of cargo for cross-border land trade under treaties with neighbouring countries. He directed the Bengal chief secretary to allow access land border transportation through all Indo-Bangladesh borders “without any further delay” and send the report by Wednesday.The state, however, maintained that it was following all norms. “We have been adhering to all norms of lockdown and social distancing. In case of Petrapole (a land port at the Bangladesh border) there has been some public issue. We will address the issue in due time after careful consideration of all the aspects involved,” said Alapan Bandopadhyay, state home secretary.The Centre also slammed the state government for violating lockdown instructions and social distancing norms, based on the findings of Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCT), as instances of people openly playing cricket or football, bathing in rivers and overcrowding in bazaars (markets) have come to its notice. The state on Wednesday reported 112 new cases taking the tally to over 1450 and four deaths||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-tells-bengal-to-open-bangladesh-access/story-BY8x89zRBAMcxli3DgGvCM.html
07-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Labour ministry helplines get over 10,000 distress calls||“We have run out of food. Can you please ask someone to come and help us?’’ This was the SOS call that Suraj Pal, a factory worker from Faridabad, placed to the labour helpline on Tuesday. Pal and six of his associates have been stuck in an aluminium factory in the industrial hub ever since the lockdown started in late March. This is the second time they are running out of food. It happened last month, prompting a similar SOS call -- and they managed to get some relief. “My employer isn’t taking calls any more,’’ Suraj Pal told HT. “We tried to leave but the police says that we cannot go without proper registration. Please, can you ask them to send us some food as we have run out?. Or maybe they can take us home to Bareilly?”Pal’s call is just one of around 10,500 calls that the labour ministry’s 20 helplines have received since April 17. The helplines are located across 31 states and manned by 75 senior officers. None of the officers is trained to deal with distress calls, but as a majority of the calls is about hunger and helplessness, they’ve all had to learn to tackle these emergencies. “These helplines were actually started to help with wage issues and provident funds but 60% of the calls are in the state’s jurisdictions. So we get in touch with local authorities and get them to organise help for the callers,’’ said the official coordinating the helplines requesting anonymity. Suraj Pal’s call threw the officials because even though food was an issue being handled by state and local officials, they knew it was too urgent to wait. “We are trying to get someone to get food to them urgently.’’ “While most of the distress calls are about being removed from their jobs or not getting wages, there are also many who call for help with recharging (topping up) their phones,’’ said the official, adding that stranded workers needed it to communicate with their family.Ever since the ministry of home affairs announced trains to ferry stranded persons, that’s become the main theme of calls. “My phone hasn’t stopped ringing,’’ said regional labour commissioner in Telengana, VT Thomas, who is managing a helpline. “Labourers from Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand all want to go home, we tell them to either contact the deputy labour commissioner or the local police official.”Interestingly, some have also tried to use the helpline as an employment exchange. “Our Port Blair office received a call from a contractor,he asked if we could put him in touch with stranded labourers because one particular factory wanted to reopen,” said an official who asked not to be named. “We put him in touch with the district administration and that factory also opened.”Regarding calls about wages, the official cited above said we reach out to the employers and tell them they can’t stop wages because it is illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-labour-ministry-helplines-get-over-10-000-distress-calls/story-hMoMRSY9QaunXsWNpCIaUN.html
07-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Migrants bitter about being forced to work against their wishes||Anger and disappointment coursed through the migrant worker population in Karnataka a day after the state cancelled special trains to take the labourers home even as other states insisted they had no intention of following suit.The controversial late-night decision also sparked a political tussle with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) pointing out the economic benefits of workers staying back and the Congress alleging the stoppage of trains was a violation of human rights.The state, which had earlier sent six trains of workers to Bhubaneswar, Patna and Hatia, wrote to the Railways on Tuesday night withdrawing its request for additional trains. The decision came after a meeting of chief minister BS Yediyurappa with construction industry representatives, who expressed concern that work will grind to a halt if the labourers left the state.The surprise move sent shockwaves through the state’s migrant population.“I want to see my family including my two children, I don’t want to work here,” said 36- year-old Vinod Kumar, who hails from Bihar and worked as a steel rod bender in a factory in Bengaluru. “I don’t want the food or money or anything else they are providing. I just want to go back and be with my family.”The government started running the single-destination, no-stops Shramik Special trains on May 1 and more than 100,000 migrants have been ferried in 122 trains since, the railways ministry said. Another 42 trains ran on Wednesday.Gujarat has sent the maximum number of such trains (25) to other states, while Bihar has received the most (13). A train usually has 24 coaches with each carrying a little over 50 passengers in place of 72. These trains run for distances of over 500 km with at least 90% occupancy.Yediyurappa defended his decision at a press briefing where he announced a ₹1,610 crore economic stimulus package. “We have requested them [the workers] to stay back as economic activity has restarted and we have provided them all the facilities they have asked for.” The CM also pointed out that 100,000 people had been allowed to travel on 3,500 state government bus trips for inter-district movement.Bangalore South MP Tejasvi Surya called it a “bold and necessary move”.“It will help migrant labourers who came here with hopes of a better life to restart their dreams. Also it will kickstart economic activities full throttle. Karnataka will emerge out of this stronger!”But the Congress didn’t agree.Former minister Priyank Kharge said anybody who wants to go should be allowed and questioned whether the migrants were being treated as bonded labour. State Congress chief DK Shivakumar said the government should have tried to win over the hearts and minds of the migrants rather than cancelling trains and trying to hold them captive. “But this is a government which cannot see, cannot hear and doesn’t have a heart,” he added.A senior state government official defended the move, saying the workers would have been sent to 14-day quarantine once they reached their destination. “Several states have been reluctant to accept them. Here they can get back to a normal life…we are paying ₹5,000 for all registered construction workers.”In neighbouring Telangana, the government said it would continue to send back workers, at least 500,000 of whom are stranded in the state. On Wednesday morning, three trains carrying 4,000 labourers left the state.“We have made arrangements for 40 special trains every day for one week for these migrant labourers, but their respective states requested us to go slow,” said Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. However, the real estate industry in Hyderabad expressed apprehension at the departure of the workers.“More than 80% of the workforce in real estate sector comprises migrant workers, particularly from Bihar, Jharkhand, UP, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. This en-masse exodus of these workers will definitely hamper projects,” said V Rajasekhar Reddy, general secretary of Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI), Telangana chapter.Despite industry concerns, a number of other states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh said they won’t stop trains.“If the governments in those states, where our Andhra workers are held up, are not showing interest in making arrangements for their transport, the AP government itself will provide transport facility to bring them back,” chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy said on Wednesday.Madhya Pradesh additional chief secretary ICP Keshri said all workers from the state will be brought back and arrangements were being made. Jharkhand transport secretary K Ravi Kumar said a total of 10,054 people including 2,146 students have arrived in Jharkhand on 12 special trains.“We are expecting the rush to continue for at least a week,” Kumar said.In Bihar, where close to 15,000 migrants and students returned on Wednesday by 13 trains from five states, the officials said stiff challenges lay ahead. “We have entered a challenging phase, with more people returning to their hometowns. The real test starts now,” said a senior state government official who declined to be named.(With inputs from other state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-migrants-bitter-about-being-forced-to-work-against-their-wishes/story-VyTF0RgKDdUmauersoaVYO.html
07-05-2020||India||Open the mind locks||The Instagram group Bois Locker Room was outed on May 3 and has since, caused immense outrage on the internet. The private messaging group comprised a number of young boys from South Delhi who would share pictures of girls — many underage — on the group, and speak in a derogatory manner about the girls sharing explicit details and even private pictures of the girls. The worst came when a few of the boys issued rape threats to a couple of girls who exposed them and their chat group. Legally, a suo moto cognizance has been taken by Delhi Commission for Women against these boys, however keeping legalities aside, experts believe that the problem is much deeper and needs more than just stricter laws or implementation of existing ones to do away with such cases. “A lot of factors go into developing such behavioural traits in young men. The portrayal of women in media, the social environment that these boys grow up in, and of course, the fact that when you are a teenager, your body develops faster than your brain. Hence, teenagers don’t think their actions through. So, these acts are a result of a mix of hormones, neurodevelopmental changes and your environment where you are living,” says Advaita Nigudkar, consultant psychologist. 18-yr-old admin of lewd chat room held; 5 more members identifiedhttps://t.co/U9FTIABFvu pic.twitter.com/gKsGrt9ldyLaw and orderSunaina Kanojia, Officer on special duty, Institute of Cyber Security and Law, Delhi University, says that one should be careful of the video calls one engages in since “virtual contact has increased due to the lockdown”. “Many cases that have been reported to us at DU involve a cyber-breach of a student’s personal photo or information by known sources like partners, friends etc. Don’t share personal or intimate photos or videos with anyone at all, even if you know them well. Live chats and videos can also be taped and one must always be mindful of this,” she says. Anyesh Roy, DCP CyPAD (Cyber Prevention, Awareness and Detection Centre), adds that it is pertinent for youngsters to seek help from parents if they get into something because of peer pressure and realise it is wrong. “Lack of communication between children, and parents or teachers, can prevent children from opening up. Do not for a moment think you can get away after indulging in unlawful cyber activity as digital prints are always left behind on the devices used and many other platforms,” warns Roy.  Shubham Singh, Cyber Expert, who helped unearth all the bois locker room group participants’ information and contact details, says, “If anyone has been a victim of cyber crime, they should immediately share that with their parents or friends without hesitating. In case of cyber breaches, also contact your local police station or cyber cell. Update privacy settings on your social media accounts. Remember that you can also report anonymously about any kind of crime on the official government cyber crime website.”  #boyslockerroom a telling tale of how toxic masculinity starts young! Underage boys gleefully planning how to rape & gangrape minor girls. Parents & teachers must address this with those Kids.. Not enough to ‘hang rapists’ .. we must attack the mentality that creates rapists! https://t.co/Jw4cFQ9gXMKavita Mungi, mental health counselor, believes that women need to be made aware of their rights, and everyone should be educated about cyber exploitation, sexting, defamation etc. “We definitely need stricter laws as it will have a strong impact as a deterrent to such deviant behaviour. Women should be aware of the existence of cyber crime cells that they can report to,” she says. Alternatively, Sadaf Vidha, therapist and researcher, says that the problem does not solely lie with the laws. “We cannot just depend on punishment and the legal system as a resolution for sexual crimes. We have to start early with new parents and young boys to break down concepts of gender and sexuality. We need multiple-level interventions, gender sexuality education at each and every level — for adults, kids, and very young kids. The automatic process that we have been following of getting married and having children needs to stop. It has to be a mindful decision to become a parent and then one needs to explain the concepts of body sexuality and gender to kids. There are countries that have extensive programmes like that such as Malaysia and Finland. So, our government needs to look into that,” says Vidha. How can parents help?Vidha says that even though, we may have convinced ourselves that we live in a modern society, this incident has shown that we have in fact, just become very good at covering up our sexism instead of getting rid of it altogether. “We need to talk about everyday sexism and patriarchy with our kids which is not happening. We may be equipping our girls more to achieve more in their career, but we have still not broken down emotions, femininity and body to boys. We are also not talking to our kids about how our bodies can be misused by people. The problem is the monster myth which says that there is one bad man or few bad men out there and the rest of us are okay. According to the monster myth, we do not take accountability as a society that at some level we are all contributing to rape culture. Parents also believe that benign sexism and patriarchy that we follow at home is okay as long as somebody doesn’t become a ‘monster’ but this is how monsters are made,” adds Vidha.  With expert @rakshit.tandon !A post shared by  Richa Chadha (@therichachadha) on May 6, 2020 at 9:10am PDTDos and DontsIf a minor is making a profile on social media it is advised that the profile be monitored actively by the parent or guardianBe mindful of the consequences of sharing any personal information or photograph on an online space as it can be downloaded and replicated in minutesBe aware that people who are part of various groups that are indulging in unlawful activities, even if they are inactive member will be liable to legal actionSchool and parents must also talk to children about the risks of being cyber bullied or peer pressured in to unlawful cyber activities.

07-05-2020||India||We should be discussing about food for the needy and not communal debates: Shashank Vyas||Not many know that the Balika Vadhu actor Shashank Vyas loves to read and write poetry. He recently penned down some lines echoing his thoughts and shared it on his social media accounts. He got loads of “love and warmth” from his fans and friends.Shashank says, “Writing is a creative process and gives you depth in life. Writing involves imagination and visualization.” His recent poem sends a strong message. In the midst of the corona outbreak, there have been communal debates in the media, and Shashank’s poem talks about unity in diversity. “It is indeed disturbing. Of late, in the media, there has been so much focus on communal news. Why are we not discussing the important things such as food, shelter, and transportation for the needy. Nowadays, I don’t feel the need to be updated on the latest situation, and that makes me peaceful. Other than a couple of media personnel, who are not biased, everything else is a big circus out there.”Talking about his love for poetry and how it all started, Vyas says, “It all started in 2009 when I lost my mother and I wasn’t getting any work. As there was a lot of time on hand, I would go to the beach and pen down my thoughts. Those poems are still with me in my diary. Later, I got busy with my professional life and writing took a backseat. And now, when I have time, I thought of writing again. With time, we also mature in our thoughts and take inspiration from our experience. The current situation motivates me.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/we-should-be-discussing-about-food-for-the-needy-and-not-communal-debates-shashank-vyas/story-ABqy1bpmwZVtLP5sWab06K.html
07-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Here’s how we should assess our progress in the fight against the spread of Covid-19.On May 5, there were 2,991 new cases of Covid-19 in India. I’ve explained previously that this doesn’t mean all 2,991 cases were discovered in the preceding 24 hours – just that the numbers were being reported in that period. Of these, 1,942 were from three states -- Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu. Without these three states, the number would have been 1,049.On May 4, there were 3,861 new cases, but excluding Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu, there were 1,391.The corresponding number on May 3 was 1,298. On May 2, it was 1,298 again. And on May 1, it was 827.So, the numbers, arranged in sequence (most recent first) are: 1049, 1391, 1298, 1298, and 827. In the preceding five days, it was 822, 678, 832, 752, and 877.I’ve done this exercise with three states, but you could, say, exclude three more (I’d pick West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and Delhi). On May 5, the number would then be 651. On May 4, 600.Is there a pattern to these numbers? What would happen if we were to leave out these six states since, say, April 1?I asked Jamie Mullick, who has been in charge of the HT Covid-19 dashboard, and he sent me two charts reproduced along with this piece (Charts 1 and 2). One was the number of new cases excluding the six states since April 1 (with a helpful five-day average line thrown in for reference and analysis). Another was a straight comparison of the number of new cases in these six states, and in the rest of India since April 1. Two things are clear from this.One, these six states have driven the increase in the daily number of cases in India. Without them, the increase wouldn’t be as sharp.But, and this is the second reading, the number of cases in the rest of India, especially as shown by the five-day average, is still rising. It seemed to be flattening towards the end of April, but it has started climbing again, albeit gradually, in May.It isn’t difficult to see why – Punjab and Rajasthan have seen new hot spots emerge in the past week. If we increase the scope of the analysis from six states to eight (to be excluded), then the curve appears to be flattening (Chart 3). Is that reason for cheer?Yes, and no.Yes, because it shows that apart from these eight states, the rest of India appears to have gotten the better of Covid-19. No, because there will always be new hot spots that emerge.But there are two very important learnings that emerge from this iterative exercise.The first is that containment and zoning are actually good approaches to dealing with Covid-19 given the geographical concentration of cases. This has been known since Wuhan, and how the Chinese dealt with it, but merits repetition.The second is that, as evident from the numbers coming out of Delhi and Tamil Nadu, no state can afford to lower its guard. Indeed, the spike in cases in Chennai over the past week can be directly attributed to the folly of the administration in announcing a hard lockdown for four days between April 26 and April 29. People rushed to stock up, especially to the large vegetable market of Koyambedu in Chennai, and many of the cases that have emerged over the past week have been traced back to that market.If, two weeks from now, Chart 1 (the number of new cases excluding the six states) shows a flattening or flattened curve, and Chart 2 (the number of new cases excluding the eight states) continues to show a downward curve, then it would be reason for cheer (and to redo the graphs with, say, only three states excluded).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-F0iEdLePI9KzmkLLA0WlsI.html
07-05-2020||India||MMC to award doctors working with Covid-19 patients credit points to renew licence||To encourage more doctors to participate in the treatment of Covid-19 patients, the Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) will award credit points to doctors to help them renew their medical licence. Every five years, doctors need to renew their licences to practice. As per norms, doctors need to earn 30 credit points over a period of five years by attending conferences and seminars. Those who fail to score the 30 points are not eligible to renew their licence. Thus, they get disqualified from medical practice. “Registered medical practitioners are at the forefront of the war against coronavirus and not only are they facing the daunting task of handling patients, they are also fighting to keep their own worries and emotional stress at bay. They are selfless, hardworking and diligent individuals who save lives on a daily basis. The noble profession of a doctor takes some serious dedication and sacrifice,” reads the circular of MMC issued on April 29. To encourage doctors to actively participate in the struggle against Sars-CoV-2 — the virus that causes Covid-19, MMC will grant two credit points per day up to a maximum of 10 to doctors. They have divided the doctors into three types—- those who are serving in government hospitals or institutions, doctors working in private hospitals for the treatment of Covid-19 patients and medical practitioners who are participating in fever, community, mobile clinics primarily for the diagnosis of patients.According to MMC, they have taken the decision to encourage doctors to come forward for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Doctors with specialisation in forensic science, psychiatry, community medicine, orthopaedics among others may not be directly involved in the treatment of Covid-19 patients but can help in screening patients and providing basic care to asymptomatic patients in Covid Care Centres. “By serving the nation during the time of the pandemic, doctors can gain points which will help them to renew their medical licences. This is a form of a reward for the Covid-19 frontliners. We have already extended the certificate renewal time of the doctors by three months,” Dr Shivkumar Utture, president of MMC said. The doctors can claim the Covid certificate from deans, district collectors, corporation health officers or civil surgeons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mmc-to-award-doctors-working-with-covid-19-patients-credit-points-to-renew-licence/story-bKVk9EsszwtpSYQlV56mAP.html
07-05-2020||India||French researcher flags Aarogya flaws, govt denies||The Union government’s Aarogya Setu application has vulnerabilities that could compromise the identity and movement of the millions of Indians who use it, according to a French computer researcher who posted a technical analysis of the flaws on Wednesday, and ostensibly illustrated how he could determine whether someone reported being infected at sensitive locations such as Parliament.The developers of the application dismissed the findings as a risk and said it was part of the application’s design that is meant to allow users to determine who in their vicinity is unwell, infected or healthy. But the defence that was dismissed by the Frenchman – who goes by the nom de guerre of Elliot Alderson --- and a second cyber expert HT spoke to.The government also said the platform is “absolutely robust, safe and secure”. “This is a technological invention of India -- ministry of electronics and information technology, our scientists, NIC, Niti Aayog and some private (entities) -- whereby it is a perfectly accountable platform to help in the fight against COVID-19,” Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told PTI.The posts by Alderson add to the misgivings expressed by privacy experts around apps such as Aarogya Setu, which has been made mandatory for an increasing number of Indians in recent days as officials push it as a crucial tool to contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.According to Alderson, the application’s location functionality can be paired with a technique called triangulation, which could allow anyone who can manipulate the programme at a technical level to determine who is infected in a specific, 1-metre area.Triangulation refers to the technique of using multiple data points to zero in on a precise information or location that is otherwise available on a more vague scale. “Triangulation is location tracking via multiple calls to the API (a component of the app) where at every iteration, a lower value is chosen. Say the first call could be 5 KM and then the next call would be 1 KM and so on,” said cyber security researcher Anand V.This was possible because apps can be reverse engineered and modified to extract data that otherwise should be inaccessible. “He used a reverse engineering tool called Frida to modify the App and feed the locations via a script,” said Anand, adding that in this manner, the entire app can be rewritten to create an imitation.“What Elliot has done is to create a modified Aarogya Setu app that simply did what it is not supposed to do. And the developers could not detect it unless he reported it,” said Anand, adding: “Imagine ISI and others doing exactly the same thing without reporting it.”The contention by the experts is that this presented a particular risk to Indians, who can potentially be targeted by domestic as well as foreign cyber criminals. “The mandatory nature of the app has already created a thriving mod industry,” Anand said.On April 30, security agencies warned army paramilitary troops against an Aarogya Setu imitation that was being spread to steal sensitive data, news agency PTI reported quoting officials.MyGov CEO Abhishek Singh told HT that the concerns raised by Alderson are incorrect and of 90 million users, only the data of 0.05% users are on the server. “The app only takes basic data, and as specified in the privacy policy, all personal data is collected only once and is encrypted, after which a device ID is created. Subsequent to that, all interactions happen only with the device ID,” Singh said.According to Anand, the vulnerability disclosed on Wednesday was one of the core issues with the Aarogya Setu: “Location collection is meaningless. It is a privacy nightmare and today’s revelations showed precisely why,” he said.A second issue is that the Aarogya Setu uses “static ID” to store contact history. This refers to how the programme logs a close contact between two people. If person A and person B come close enough for the infection to spread between them, the app remembers the devices by using randomly generated identifiers. This identifier does not change, which means if someone can access these static IDs, they track the health status of the person.“Any static ID that you obtain can be used to figure out what happened to the person behind the static ID,” said Anand. Alderson, in a post on Tuesday, described how he was able to break into the Aarogya Setu and access any file used by the app, which would include those that store such static IDs.A third issue, Anand added, was that the code was not open source, which means its functionalities and vulnerabilities cannot be tested. “Make it open source to create trust and don’t bait and switch to something else that will last long after the pandemic is gone,” he said.An official from the information and technology ministry said none of the revelations indicated Aarogya Setu had been hacked. “There has been no sort of hacking or breach of privacy in the Aarogya Setu. The allegations are based on amateur attempts by changing location and data correlation to portray it as hacking. The app would have shown similar data to anyone at a particular location. Do not indulge in petty attempts to attract attention while we are in the midst of a pandemic. Ethics are important,” said this official, asking not to be named.Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said Alderson pointed out that the flaws outlined by Rahul Gandhi were absolutely correct. The problems, Surjewala added, were spread over three areas: that the Aarogya Setu’s data collection violated the right to privacy, that it was not developed by the government’s engineers and data was stored on foreign servers and that human control in the backend could manipulate the health status of an individual||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/french-researcher-flags-aarogya-flaws-govt-denies/story-Ea0mGXS3NWRvlfYSBJJYaK.html
07-05-2020||India||Top Hizbul commander Riyaz Naikoo killed in encounter||Riyaz Naikoo, 35, a top terrorist of the Hizbul Mujahideen, was killed in an encounter with security forces at his village in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district, officials said on Wednesday, announcing a major breakthrough that is expected to weaken the home-grown terror group significantly. Naikoo, who carried a Rs 12 lakh reward on his head, was among four militants killed in Pulwama after security forces launched three separate, coordinated operations in a 25km radius on Tuesday night and early Wednesday after inputs that the Hizbul operational commander could be hiding in the area. People familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that according to inputs Naikoo was visiting his family on Tuesday; he is believed to have stayed overnight at a hideout in Awantipora’s Gulzarpora Beighpora village. Naikoo, also known as Zubair ul Islam and Bin Qasim, who emerged as the face of the Hizbul in the Valley and propagated radicalism through audio and video messages on social media — much like his predecessor Burhan Wani — and another terrorist were shot dead after a five-hour gunfight.According to a statement by the police, Naikoo was involved in the killings of civilians including truck drivers and policemen. Among Kashmir’s new generation of terrorists, he effectively used the social media for recruitment. The people familiar with the matter said that in June, he would have completed eight years as a terrorist with the Hizbul Mujahideen. The people added that the Kashmir Police’s anti-militancy unit, Special Operations Group, knew he was going to be in the village and also that he was going to spend the night there. Late on Tuesday itself, a contingent of J&K Police and troopers from the 21 Rashtriya Rifles surrounded the village. They launched their operation in the early hours of Wednesday. A firefight ensued. When it was over, the terrorist and his associate were found in the bunker. Both died of gunshot wounds. “It is a major success for the security forces in Kashmir,” a senior J&K police officer said on condition of anonymity. The police statement said Naikoo was involved in the killing of a panchayat sarpanch’s father, Haji Ghulan Mohd Dar, in 2014, that of head constable Ashiq Hussain Mir, and more recently, the murder of migrant workers and truck drivers. Authorities suspended mobile internet and SMS services soon after the encounter, fearing the circulation of provocative messages following the death of the local terrorist leader and an overall deterioration in law and order situation. Additional security forces were deployed in the four districts of Pulwama, Shopian, Kulgam and Anantnag, considered the hotbed of militancy.After the July 2016 encounter killing of Hizbul leader Wani, a resident of Tral area in Pulwama, stone-pelting mobs descended on streets and clashed with security forces, resulting in the deaths of 75 civilians and two law enforcement personnel in four months in one of the most turbulent phases in militancy in Kashmir, according to official data. But several media reports put the death toll much higher. Officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Naikoo’s body might not be handed over to his family and could be buried in another district to avoid crowds and to ensure adherence to social distancing norms in place due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The successful operation came just four days after the killing of five security men, including the Commanding Officer of a Rashtriya Rifles battalion and a Major, during an encounter in north Kashmir’s Handwara. Two terrorists of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, too, were killed in the gunfight.Since March 21, over 30 terrorists have been killed in 15 gun battles across the Valley. Twenty security personnel lost their lives in these encounters.A police spokesperson confirmed the killing of Naikoo, though the army said it will not reveal the names of those gunned down.Army spokesperson Colonel Aman Anand said: “The security forces are the heroes who eliminated four terrorists in 24 hours. We shall not glorify the terrorists by releasing their names.” Two more terrorists were killed in Sharali Khrew, 12km from Naikoo’s village, a senior police officer who was part of the operation said, requesting anonymity. An overground worker was arrested at the third operation site, Sathura Tral. Officials said the operation to track down Naikoo began at least two days ago. The army and the police even brought earth-digging equipment, including four JCB machines, to Naikoo’s village after inputs that the wanted terrorist could be using an underground hideout, according to villagers.Soon after the news of the operation surfaced, youngsters started pelting stones at security forces. Eleven people were injured in the scuffle.As security forces surrounded six-seven houses in the village, they came under fire from Naikoo and his associate. An encounter ensued, and both the terrorists were shot dead. The other militant killed with Naikoo was believed to be Adil Ahmed of Panzan village in Pulwama district. He was active for the past two years. His identity was not confirmed by the police or government authorities who also chose not to divulge details of the two others killed on Wednesday.Experts said the operation could be a major boost for security forces. “Leadership decapitation is always a big blow to terror organisations. There is both a physical dimension of an organisation suddenly losing someone who was in control and also the psychological dimension of the effect on morale and having to find a replacement,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-hizb-commander-riyaz-naikoo-killed-in-encounter/story-PZKYBjj7pFDO0AwqpoLp3O.html
07-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: 50,000 cases and counting, fresh spikes in urban centres||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the country crossed 50,000 on Wednesday, nearly doubling over the course of 11 days, even as limited reopening of businesses made necessary by a sluggish economy triggered worries of another wave of the contagion across hot spots.The spread of the infectious disease has largely been pushed by urban hot spots in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi, the three worst-hit states. On Wednesday, 3,490 new Covid-19 cases were diagnosed and 98 more deaths from the disease were reported, taking the total tally to 52,967 and fatalities to 1,711.The latest 10,000 infections were recorded in three days, two fewer than it took for the tally to go from about 30,000 to 40,000. It took seven days for the cases to climb from 20,000 to 30,000. India recorded its first 10,000 Covid-19 cases in nearly 43 days, with a wave of infections beginning in March after three isolated cases were first reported in Kerala in January. The disease’s doubling rate, which is defined as the average period it takes for a twofold rise, decreased from 11.5 days on May 3 – the cases hit 40,000 on that day – to 10.3 on Wednesday, the first time the figure has significantly reduced during the lockdown. The doubling rate -- which is calculated over a period of last seven days -- was four days at the beginning of April. Experts say the peak of the outbreak is yet to come. Some projections show the peak for the current wave of cases could hit in four-six weeks, with studies expecting another spurt in winter this year.On Wednesday, the number of infections in Delhi rose to 5,532 after 428 new cases were reported. On average, India has reported 2,900 cases over the last five days. The corresponding numbers for the previous five days and those before that were 1,731 and 1,547. The data, which is based on official figures from states, shows that more than a third of the total cases have been reported over the past week.Maharashtra reported 1,233 new cases and 34 more deaths during the day and its overall tally was 16,758. Of these, 10,527 cases – about a fifth of the national tally – have been reported in Mumbai alone. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said he will hold a meeting with Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to discuss the worsening situation in the state.“The situation in Maharashtra is certainly a matter of concern right now as 34 out of 36 districts are affected by Covid-19… Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Nagpur, Nashik, Aurangabad, Solapur, among the 34 districts are a cause of concern for us,” the minister said at a news briefing, adding that a team from the Centre will provide further help to the state.Maharashtra is followed by Gujarat, which recorded 6,625 cases till Wednesday.The surge of Covid-19 continued in Tamil Nadu as the state recorded its biggest single-day jump of 771 cases, the majority of them linked to the hot spot of a market in Koyambedu. The total infections in the state stood at 4,829.Experts fear India’s tally may increase as the government plans to bring back a large number of Indians stranded abroad.In the first week of a massive air operation expected to begin on Friday, 64 flights will bring 15,000 Indian citizens home from 12 countries. All those who travel back have to pay for their tickets, undergo screening and quarantine after landing. The navy has already kicked off one leg of the evacuation exercise by dispatching two warships to the Maldives.The Union government has maintained that the country is on the right path in controlling the infections. While experts have praised India’s action in enforcing a nationwide lockdown on March 25, they say the next few weeks will be crucial for the country to flatten its curve of infections.On Monday, the third phase of the nationwide lockdown, which allows considerable relaxations in low-risk areas, began after nearly 40 days of strict restrictions. Experts say that while the impact of the lockdown appeared to have relatively controlled the spread, the gains could get undermined if clusters were not contained effectively, and people not tested widely. The next few weeks will determine the country’s trajectory in managing the outbreak and preventing the health care infrastructure from being overrun.The number of samples tested for Covid-19 in India crossed a million on Saturday, up from 38,914 on April 1, which took the number of tests to almost 783 per million of the population. The health ministry expects testing to cross 100,000 tests a day soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-000-cases-and-counting-fresh-spikes-in-urban-centres/story-Q23ovgTu3J7k6m5MGfSVzL.html
07-05-2020||India||Amid Covid-19 scourge, Dharavi’s residents struggle to fight hunger||Besieged by Covid-19 infections, financially struck low by the lockdown and turned a containment zone, the people of Asia’s largest slum are now struggling to keep hunger at bay. Home to at least quarter of a million residents across communities, Dharavi -- spread across around 240 hectares of south-central Mumbai -- houses thousands of small-scale businesses and entrepreneurs from pottery to tailoring units, bakeries and leather goods makers. Within a month of recording its first case on April 1, the number of positive cases had increased to 407; by May 6 the total number of cases in Dharavi was 733, with 21 deaths reported.In the face of such adversity, a group of 10 young men -- all residents of Dharavi’s Rajiv Gandhi Nagar -- are trying to make sure that people do not go hungry. The group, which calls itself Dharavi Boys over social media platforms, consists of college students who pooled money to support a handful of families in dire need of food. Soon, donations began to pour in through their extended networks of friends, and two days ago, they set up a Feed Dharavi campaign on crowdfunding site, Ketto. Till date, they have been able to support at least 100 families. They have their own Twitter handle: @DharaviBoys, with 13 followers at present. Their feed, however, is replete with messages of thanks to those who have donated money for their initiative. On May 1, the day they set up the account, they tweeted:“The lockdown has been extended. For us, the news is clear: more days without work and food. We want YOU to reach out to the people of Dharavi. Please help our families with at least basic food supplies. #dharavi #mumbai #india #COVID19 #corona #coronavirusindia”Stanley Anto, a social worker based in Kalamboli, Navi Mumbai, offered support to the group; within a day of setting up the account on Twitter, they also released a poster: “For as little as Rs. 1720, you can help us provide at least a month’s supply of food rations to a needy family. Please reach out to us if you can help!” Less than a week old, the feed regularly posts the contributions it has received, as well as the food rations it has distributed till now. A family living in the United States contributed Rs 40,000; another young boy in Pune broke his piggy bank to donate a sum. “We began this #feedDharavi campaign because when we saw families around us struggling, we just couldn’t sit back and watch. With the little we had, we only managed to feed a few.And we thought that it would be the end of our efforts. Then, Stanley sir came to our aid and helped us feed more families. And just like us, he wasn’t satisfied. So, he roped in his friends and family and together, we fed a few more,” their twitter feed read on May 4.  “Almost all people in these slums are daily wage earners and not going to work for so long means they have absolutely no money and hence cannot buy food. As young students, we thought of doing something for people from our own locality and hence decided to pool some resources,” said Vikas Jaiswar, a 24-year-old who graduated with an engineering degree from a Navi Mumbai college last year. The group, which claims to not belong to any political or religious organisation but a “informal group of youngsters” called the Friendly Life Youth Group, has tied up with local traders who arrange for the supplies which includes rice, flour, oil, salt and sugar. However, as the cases rise, the young men are also facing several difficulties in their work. “A couple from our locality who was providing similar help caught the virus and they are in the hospital. We are all very scared when we go out but we take adequate precautions and use masks, sanitisers and gloves in the whole process,” Jaiswar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-disease-scourge-dharavi-s-residents-struggle-to-fight-hunger/story-RAn9zyZFaKDxivf4792bZI.html
07-05-2020||India||Early quarantine, Covid-19 testing suggested for loss of taste, smell||A leading UK-based scientific journal’s editor-in-chief has urged front line health workers to see a sudden loss of smell and taste as early symptoms of mild coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to get quarantined and tested.“A proposal, actually a plea, from several doctors on the frontline of Covid-19. Those with a loss of smell should be advised to self-isolate and be tested. This simple manoeuvre could save lives,” tweeted Dr Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet.“Amnosia, or the loss of smell, and, with it, the altering of the sense of taste, is a well-established symptom of Covid-19, just like dry cough, fever, and difficulty in breathing. There are very few conditions that lead to a sudden loss of smell, so it should be treated as an early sign, especially by people who risk exposure at the front lines and those who develop it with other Covid-19 symptoms,” said Dr Ajay Swaroop, chairman of the department of Ear, Nose, Throat, Sir Gangaram Hospital, New Delhi.Health workers are at high risk of infection both from undiagnosed cases and from patients in isolation wards.Last month, researchers from the University of California (UC) San Diego found Covid-19 patients who, with a loss of smell and taste, had a 10-fold higher risk of being hospitalised compared to those without any symptom.“Based on our study, if you have smell and taste loss, you are more than 10 times more likely to have Covid-19 infection than other causes of infection. The most common first sign of a Covid-19 infection remains fever, but fatigue and loss of smell and taste follow as other very common initial symptoms,” said Dr Carol Yan, an otolaryngologist, and head and neck surgeon at UC San Diego Health. The findings were published in the journal International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology on April 12.The San Diago study found that among those who reported loss of smell and taste, the loss was typically profound, not mild. The effect was, however, temporary, and both smell and taste were restored within two to four weeks of infection.“Among the Covid-19 patients with smell loss, more than 70 per cent had reported improvement of smell at the time of the survey and of those who hadn’t reported improvement, many had only been diagnosed recently,” said Yan.Covid-19 symptoms include fever, dry cough, tiredness, shortness of breath, or difficulty in breathing. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a sudden loss of taste or smell, along with either cough or shortness of breath, should be taken as a sign of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/early-quarantine-testing-suggested-for-loss-of-taste-smell/story-TTm4naxJ3tCtAkjPcHY2EN.html
07-05-2020||India||BMC ramps up infra to tackle Covid-19 cases spike in Mumbai||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is ramping up health care infrastructure to tackle a surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the financial capital of Mumbai, the city which has so far accounted for a fifth of India’s cases, even as the authority’s worst-case projection pegs the likely number of infections in the city by the end of this month at 75,000. On Wednesday, the total number of cases in Mumbai stood at 10,714 cases, with 412 people dying of the infectious disease. There are 2,083 containment zones in the city.“The way to deal with this situation is to be prepared. We should not be taken by surprise at a later date, and caught scrambling for resources. Mumbai is better off overestimating the extent of the spread of Covid-19. To be prepared, we need hospital and quarantine beds to match our projected figures; we need more doctors to attend to patients being treated at hospitals, more nurses, personal protective equipment (PPE) for our front line staff,” a senior BMC officer said on condition of anonymity.The BMC is preparing to convert Mumbai’s large open spaces, playgrounds and sports complexes into temporary quarantine centres or Covid Care Centres (CCCs). The Mahalaxmi Race Course is set to house 200 isolation beds in its parking lot, the Mahim Nature Park will have 600 beds, the Richardson and Cruddas factory near JJ Hospital will have 200 beds, the Bandra Kurla Complex’s exhibition grounds are set to house 500 beds, the Nehru Science Centre will have 100 beds and the Andheri Sports complex will have 100 beds. With these, among others, the present capacity of 14,000 beds will be expanded to 34,000 beds, according to the official. The BMC is also readying 350 municipal schools to create an additional capacity of 35,000 beds.As approximately 60% of the total cases are asymptomatic, the city needs to ramp up the number of beds at CCCs alongside increasing the number of available hospital beds, experts say. “We have decided to move asymptomatic patients to CCCs so that the hospital beds they would otherwise have utilised can be made available for patients who need urgent and constant medical attention,” said municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi.High-risk contacts of Covid-19-positive patients, who were earlier being moved to CCCs, are now being asked to quarantine themselves at home, unless they live in small houses shared by more family members. “We are able to make more CCC beds available for asymptomatic positive patients,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bmc-ramps-up-infra-to-tackle-case-spike/story-5nGfcIeQQKfCqN3qsoFWJP.html
07-05-2020||India||With 769 new cases, Mumbai Covid-19 cases surge past the 10,000-mark||Mumbai surged past 10,000 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday after recording 769 new infections, the highest single-day jump in the city worst hit by the pathogen as authorities scaled up testing to contain the outbreak that is expected to peak by the end of the month.Twenty five people died in the coastal city on Tuesday, pushing the death toll up to 412. The city has a recovery rate of around 16% with 1,686 patients overcoming the disease as of Tuesday.Maharashtra also saw its biggest daily spike in case numbers with 1,233 persons testing positive for the virus on Wednesday, taking the tally of cases to 16,758. The state also recorded 34 deaths, which takes its total fatalities to 651.Maharashtra’s doubling rate currently stands at 10 days, slightly lower than the corresponding figure for the country that stood at 10.7. Roughly two-thirds of the cases in the state are from Mumbai, which now has 10,714 infections.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation said it expects around 75,000 cases by the end of the month and plans to ramp up testing capacity to around 10,000 daily in the coming two weeks from its current capacity of 6,000 tests.In Mumbai, nearly 100,000 tests have been conducted with a daily average of roughly 4,000. Across India, these figures stand at 1.27 million and 19,600.The highest number of cases in the city are from Worli and Prabhadevi that fall under the G South Ward, where the tally is close to 1,000 followed by Dharavi (G North Ward) with 773 cases.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC, said, “The doubling rate of Mumbai (rate at which the positive cases double) is still the same at 10 days, and basis on that we have projected 75,000 cases by end of this month. This does not necessarily mean that we will have that much cases, but we have to be ready for the same. We have readied beds for around 60,000 patients, and in the coming days we should be ready with beds for all the projected cases.”To tackle the surge in cases, the state government has asked private doctors below 55 and ones without co-morbidities to report with immediate effect to Covid-19 dedicated hospitals for treatment of patients“The decision on private doctors was taken considering the demand in the coming day. Currently, as per the Department of Medical Education and Research (DMER), there are about 15,000 doctors in Mumbai who are at home. I appeal to private doctors that the state needs you now and they should participate in this work. The services of the doctors would primarily be for Mumbai. If needed their services can be used elsewhere as well,” health minister Rajesh Tope told reporters.He held a meeting with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on the preparation and planning related to the pandemic. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray interacted with the army, navy, railways and Mumbai Port Trust officials to provide their hospitals in Mumbai, Pune and other major cities as “part of preparedness”.Experts said increasing testing capacity must be augmented with community quarantining for potential patients. “Mere increasing of tests will not help us detecting more cases, and there are not much resources for testing asymptomatic suspects nor it is medically advisable. Hence, community quarantine is something we have to focus at and also educate the citizens of getting quarantined institutionally, in case home quarantine is not possible,” said Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, a public health consultant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-769-new-cases-mumbai-surges-past-the-10-000-mark/story-DU65Jg8Xpno4Fd6WJoHtwL.html
07-05-2020||India||Delhi court orders FIR against two women for communal slurs, lockdown violation||A Delhi court on Wednesday directed the city police to register an FIR against two women who had allegedly violated the lockdown orders and passed communal slurs in the Rodgran, Lal Kuan on April 16, stating that this might lead to communal tension in the area which had witnessed tension due to a parking fight.Metropolitan Magistrate Rishabh Kapoor ordered that the case be registered against the two women under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 153A (vilification or attacks upon the religion, race, place of birth, residence, language) and 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs).According to a complaint by a local resident, on April 16, the two women—Mamta and Suraiya—had allegedly tried to disrupt the communal harmony by passing communally disparaging remarks. The complainant Waiz Islam contended that these two women were carrying metal rods in their hands and caused public annoyance by smashing the doors of houses and shops, mostly populated by the Muslims.He said the video of the incident was taken and uploaded on the web. The complaint added that the area is communally sensitive and has already witnessed communal tension due to a parking issue. He said that even though the matter was reported to the Station House Officer (SHO) and an email was also sent to the DCP, no action has been taken so far.In an Action Taken Report (ATR), the Delhi police informed the court that the two women were out on the streets to feed the stray dogs and had a heated exchange with the people of Rodgran. The police said the ladies did not pass any communal slurs and a local press reporter uploaded the video on the web without verifying it.However, the court said that the duo had violated the lockdown and even though they belonged to an NGO, they should have carried proper passes granting them permission to roam freely. The judge also pointed out that both the women were residents of Farshkahan, Lal Kuan and Gali Jamun Wali, Ballimaran, around 450 and 750 meters respectively from the place of the incident.The Metropolitan Magistrate said that there is no justification as to what the women were doing in the area where the incident occurred. He said all the offences are cognizable in nature and requires investigation.“…prima facie commission of cognizable offence is shown. The area of occurrence is a sensitive area which has already witnessed communal tension on a previous occasion, therefore, (if) incidents like these are not taken in law, it would lead to communal disharmony and disturbance in public peace and tranquillity, which the nation is not prepared (for) at this time of Covid-19,” the judge said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-court-orders-fir-against-two-women-for-communal-slurs-lockdown-violation/story-kgXEhmePTxKQBdHYItoYkL.html
07-05-2020||India||Media body asks govt for stimulus package||The print media industry has suffered losses to the tune of Rs 4500 crore during the months of March and April, the Indian Newspaper Society (INS) said on Wednesday, seeking a relief and stimulus package for the sector that employees three million people directly or indirectly.In a statement released on Wednesday, Shailesh Gupta, President of the INS said the body has requested the Centre for a stimulus package and also sought the support of all state governments and public sector firms , as well as the Bureau of Outreach and Communication (BOC) to take immediate steps to release the dues (for advertising by government and government departments) payable up to April. “Newspapers are facing the most turbulent and difficult period of all times. This industry directly and indirectly gives employment to 3 million people. However, against all odds and in spite of the increasing costs with no returns, all necessary steps are taken to ensure that the newspaper reaches every morning to its readers in every nook and corner of the country regularly,” Gupta said.The INS president on behalf of its members, expressed his gratitude and appreciated the efforts of the Chief Minister of Gujarat Vijay Rupani who has promised to clear all the pending payments arising from government advertising till April. “This move will provide much needed respite to the print media industry, which has lost nearly 4500 Crores during March and April,” the INS statement said.We look forward to a similar approach from Prime Minister Modi, as over the past few weeks INS has requested the Union Government for a stimulus package, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/media-body-asks-govt-for-stimulus-package/story-BALnsKK7MN8AWAXHw4tNVK.html
07-05-2020||India||Covid-19 task force gauges treatment tech being developed||Among various treatment technologies being evaluated by the Centre’s Covid-19 task force are deployable or mobile hospitals; a DNA vaccine against the major viral membrane protein responsible for the cell entry of coronavirus; the development of antibodies; and an antibody gel to inactivate Sars-CoV-2 virus at the point of entry.These are in various stages of research and development according to National Research Development Corporation’s (NRDC) Compendium of Indian Technologies for combating Covid-19 released on Wednesday. As far as vaccines are concerned, experts said these will take at least a year to be developed.The compendium was launched by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, which has information on 200 Covid-19 technologies, ongoing research, and technologies already available for commercialisation. Most of these technologies are proof-of-concept (POC) tested, and can help entrepreneurs take the product to market faster, a statement issued by the Union ministry of Science & Technology said.According to the compendium, Zydus Cadila, which is developing the viral membrane protein vaccine, is also involved in the development of a live attenuated recombinant measles virus vector vaccine against Covid-19; Bharat Biotech is developing an intranasal vaccine called ‘CoroFlu’; Indian Immunologicals Limited is developing a live attenuated severe acute respiratory syndrome vaccine which has been found to be effective in Golden Syrian Hamsters; and Serum Institute of India, in collaboration with US-based Codagenix, is developing a vaccine which is now in animal testing phase.“The DNA vaccine involves giving a DNA which will produce certain proteins to help protect against the infection. No antigen will be given. The second measles virus vectored vaccine is nothing but a recombinant vaccine which will have a combination of measles RNA with Sars-CoV-2 virus RNA. The Serum Institute vaccine is also a recombinant vaccine,” said Dr Shobha Broor, Dr former head of the department of virology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.“As far as I know, these are all in development stage. They will go through pre-clinical trials in animals and then phase 1 trials in humans for safety and then phase 2 and 3. Trials may be expedited but normally it takes more than a year for all these processes,” added Dr Broor.The compendium says deployable hospitals are already in development stage. Modulus, a start-up in the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras research park, has signed an MoU with Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical sciences and Technology (SCTIMST), Trivandrum to develop the technology. It adds that SCTIMST is also developing isolation pods -- with a cover and light bed -- for Covid-19 patients to help them travel safely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/task-force-gauges-treatment-tech-being-developed/story-DJRqvhQfMMMlOS4oV01TXP.html
07-05-2020||India||Delhi HC upholds Sanjeev Chawla bail in match fixing case||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday upheld the bail granted to alleged bookie Sanjeev Chawla by a trial court last week. Chawla, an accused in the 2000 cricket match fixing scandal,was extradited to India from the UK in February. Justice Asha Menon said that there is no evidence either through action or words which show that Chawla “has or intends to thwart the process of justice or prevent fair trial”. “The State has not succeeded in making out a case for cancellation of bail of the accused….. ,” the court said while recommending the use of technology used by countries to track under-trials who are out on bail. The court also said that though the Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Jain referred to the existence of an alleged syndicate, the existence of such a syndicate was still being investigated. The ruling came on a plea by Delhi Police which had sought cancellation of bail granted to Chawla contending that he would try to abscond, and tamper with evidence. The ASG had also said that it took seven years (after filing of the charge sheet in 2013) to extradite Chawla from the UK, and there is evidence that he had fixed matches with the former South African captain Hansie Cronje. The court, however, said it cannot be overlooked that out of the remaining four accused in the case, three were arrested in the year 2000, when the FIR was registered, and all of them are on bail. The high court told Chawla not to leave the city and keep his phone operational at all times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-upholds-sanjeev-chawla-bail-in-match-fixing-case/story-ybZqGa0VHVVkcOZ4WoAF6I.html
07-05-2020||India||18-year-old admin of lewd chat room held from Noida; 5 more members identified||The Delhi Police on Wednesday arrested an 18-year-old from Noida and said he was an administrator of an Instagram group in which members discussed raping their classmates and made lurid remarks while sharing their photos.The arrest came a day after investigators said the group, “Bois Locker Room”, was found to have 22 members – two of them adults and studying in colleges – after they took into custody a 15-year-old boy over the chat messages.After the arrest of the 18-year-old on Wednesday, a senior police officer said on condition of anonymity: “He has told us that he had created the group in the first week of April and added a close group of friends from Noida and Delhi. He then made some of them admin of the same group. Those new admins further added their friends from their schools and coaching centres and colleges in Delhi and NCR.” The officer said that the 18-year-old recently took his Class 12 examinations at a school in Noida.On the arrest of the 15-year-old a day earlier, the official said: “The boy was accused by some other members of the group of being the admin of the group. While the boy has denied being an admin, we have got to know that there was more than one admin.” Though apprehended by the police, the Delhi schoolboy is currently with his parents. “The juvenile justice board is currently not open for these cases. So, we are letting him be with his parents on the condition that he wouldn’t leave the city without our permission,” the officer said.Confirming the arrest of the 18-year-old teenager on Wednesday, Anyesh Roy, deputy commissioner of police (cybercrime), said his department was still waiting for details from Instagram. “We had asked them for information about the alleged group and its members. The report from the platform is awaited.”On Tuesday, a statement by Facebook, the parent company of Instagram, said they take such issues “very seriously”. An official said that Instagram was in touch with the Delhi Police. “The devices of the identified members of the group have been seized and sent for forensic analysis… We are ascertaining the roles of other members,” Roy said.Until the details from Instagram are provided, investigators said they were relying on “material evidence” such as screenshots of the conversations and the versions of the adult suspects who were being interrogated and the interview of the minors. “Till Tuesday, we knew of 22 members in that group. Today, we have got to know of five more members, taking the total to 27. While we know all of them by their names, we have so far got the details of 14 of them. Six of them are adults. Eight others are minors,” said a third officer, who requested anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/18-yr-old-admin-of-lewd-chat-room-held-5-more-members-identified/story-g6FkJYRRWYA1uzL6O9PSCI.html
07-05-2020||India||‘Leader decapitation always a blow’: Experts on Hizbul chief Riyaz Naikoo’s killing||The killing on Wednesday of the chief of the Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), Riyaz Naikoo, has dealt a body blow to the banned terror outfit in the Kashmir Valley, experts said. Naikoo, who led HM since 2017, carried a Rs 12 lakh bounty on his head. He was killed with another terrorist at his native Beighbora village in Kahsmir’s Pulwama district. A Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) spokesperson identified Naikoo as one of the terrorists killed, while the Indian Army said it would not glorify terrorists by releasing their names.Lt Gen D S Hooda (retd), a former commander of the army’s northern command, said leadership decapitation is always a big blow to terror organisations. “There is both a physical dimension of an organisation suddenly losing someone who was in control and also the psychological dimension of the effect on morale and having to find a replacement,” he said.Hooda, who said all these factors induce fear and panic among terrorist organisations, congratulated the security forces for great success. Naikoo’s killing came days after five security men, including the commanding officer of a Rashtriya Rifles battalion and a major, were killed in a counterterror operation in north Kashmir’s Handwara.Experts said the killing of Naikoo in his own village was possible because the security forces had accurate intelligence about his movements. “People are sick of these terrorists and their diktats. They are providing intelligence to security personnel. Someone will take Naikoo’s place eventually but Hizbul Mujahideen has its back against the wall,” said Lt Gen BS Jaswal (retd), also a former commander of the army’s northern command.Indian Army spokesperson Colonel Aman Anand said they won’t confirm the names of the terrorists killed. “The security forces are the heroes who eliminated 4 terrorists in 24 hours,” he said. Lt Gen Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director-general of military operations, agreed with the army’s decision and said that “terrorists should not be glorified”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leader-decapitation-always-a-blow/story-bZZFfXc8hQQmoaTBjOHCOP.html
07-05-2020||India||150 highly trained foreign terrorists in Kashmir Valley, say experts||Around 150 highly-trained foreign terrorists mostly belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) are active in the Kashmir Valley, two people involved in counter-insurgency in the region said on Wednesday amid a spike in the violence there. Four terrorists, including Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo who carried a bounty of Rs 12 lakh on his head, were killed in gun battles with security forces in Kashmir on Wednesday. Security forces have intensified operations in Kashmir amid a nationwide Covid-19 lockdown and killed at least 36 terrorists since late March. Around 20 soldiers, including a high-ranking army officer, have been killed during the same period. According to the government data, 13 of the 68 terrorists killed in Jammu & Kashmir this year were foreigners. Foreign terrorists accounted for 31 out of 156 killed in gun battles with security forces in the Union Territory last year. According to the data, 219 locals joined militancy in Kashmir in 2018, 119 in 2019 and 35 this year till date.The presence of the higher number of foreign terrorists in the Valley has particularly set alarm bells ringing among the security forces and intelligence agencies. A large number of them are believed to have infiltrated into India in April. Close to 150 local militants were also active in the Valley. Most of the foreign terrorists are usually holed up in Pulwama, Anantnag, Kupwara, Shopian, Kulgam and Baramulla districts and they try to attack camps of security forces or their patrols.“The presence of over 150 FTs [foreign terrorists] in the Valley that too in the first four months of the year is worrisome. This number is likely to swell with the opening of infiltration routes as over 250 terrorists are waiting at the launch pads across the border,” said one of the officials cited above. The second counter-insurgency official said the foreign terrorists are getting support from locals while they hide for weeks in different villages.A large number of foreign terrorists are believed to be a part of the new outfit called The Resistance Front (TRF) created by the Pakistan army and spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence in response to the nullification last year of the Constitution’s Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. Indian agencies believe TRF is the LeT’s new name as Islamabad faces international scrutiny over the terror groups sheltered in Pakistan. Terror groups have changed their names in the past too in similar situations. Lt Gen Satish Dua (retd), a former commander of the Srinagar-based 15 Corps, said Pakistan has been trying to step up its activities in the Valley after Article 370 was nullified. “There was no internet for so many months. So, there was no communication. The intelligence about the movement of FTs was weak as well as these terrorists were also not moving much. But they are under pressure to carry out strikes,” Dua said, referring to the communications blackout imposed last year to check protests against the nullification. Dua said through moves like creating TRF, terror groups were trying to “repackage their methodology and aggregate various groups”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/150-highly-trained-foreign-terrorists-in-valley-experts/story-AS5WY3Nu3GG6eQTAVs6vBP.html
07-05-2020||India||Riyaz Naikoo, schoolteacher to one of Kashmir Valley’s most wanted men||Riyaz Naikoo, who rose to prominence in the Hizbul ranks after the encounter killing of militant leader Burhan Wani in 2016, dodged the police for eight years, before he was finally killed in an encounter in his village in south Kashmir’s Pulwama on Wednesday. After Wani’s death, he was actively involved in militancy in Kashmir, especially south Kashmir. A resident of Gulzarpora Beighpora village, Naikoo was named in the killings of civilians including truck drivers, and policemen, according to a statement by the police.Before joining the Hizbul Mujahideen, Naikoo used to teach mathematics at a private school in Pulwama. The son of a farmer, Naikoo was detained by security forces during the unrest of 2010 and released in 2012. He was believed to have been radicalised around the same time.After Wani’s death created a vacuum in Hizbul, Naikoo stepped up, and circulated his audio and video messages on the social media to attract the youth. According to the security establishment, the bespectacled de facto chief Hizbul chief used the web to find new recruits. A postgraduate, he carried a reward of Rs 12 lakh on his head. Naikoo was listed a category “A++” militant, which is the classification for most-wanted militants in the Valley. The forces have actively pursued him over the past couple of years and launched several operations in south Kashmir to trap him. He managed to escape every time — until Wednesday, when he and an associate were killed in Gulzarpora Beighpora, 16km from Pulwama town. According to local residents, he had come to his village to meet his ailing mother. In the third week of May 2012, he left home, according to news agency PTI. In 2016, he made a dramatic appearance at the funeral of a militant in Shopian carrying a Kalashnikov rifle. He fired several shots in the air, starting a trend of giving gun salute to militants who were killed by security forces.Naikoo released a video in 2017, saying he would welcome the return of Kashmiri Pandits in the Kashmir Valley and claimed that terrorists were not enemies of the Pandits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schoolteacher-to-one-of-valley-s-most-wanted-men/story-XnDOtwi6ndTqRDnERCxNjM.html
07-05-2020||India||Spike in encounters in recent days as Pakistan pushes terrorists||Increased surveillance by security forces and fresh infiltration attempts — some of them successful — by militants are behind the frequent encounters in Jammu and Kashmir over the past one and a half months, according to officials. Since March 21, at least 33 militants and two of their associates have been killed in 15 gunfights across the Valley. Most of these encounters took place in four districts of south Kashmir — Pulwama, Shopian, Kulgam and Anantnag, which are considered the hotbed of militancy.Twenty security personnel lost their lives in this period. Eighteen were killed in gunfights and in attacks by militants, and two army men died on the Line of Control (LoC) in ceasefire violations by Pakistan.A senior police officer who did not want to be named said the security grid has increased surveillance in the four districts of south Kashmir, while also keeping a close watch on the LoC. “There is a pattern of encounters going up in the months of April and May. Last year too, several operations were seen in Kashmir during these months,” the officer said. “March, April and May are the months when the snow starts melting on the upper reaches (of the Himalayas), and militants start infiltrating from PoK (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) into Kashmir — which results in several encounters,” the officer added. He said with modern surveillance gadgets, security forces are registering big successes in tracking and zeroing in on militants. Another officer, who too did not want to be named, put emphasis on the need for technology-based surveillance in anti-militancy operations, while underscoring the importance of tip-offs by sources in such campaigns. “Once a militant comes in our radar, he is tracked through electronic surveillance, and the success is remarkable. Also, human intelligence inputs help the forces to coordinate operations in the better way,” the second officer said.Earlier, Dilbag Singh, Jammu and Kashmir director general of police, too, cited fresh infiltration attempts reported from north Kashmir’s Uri and Kupwara sectors as reasons behind frequent encounters.“We get to know about militants and chase them. Sometimes, we also suffer casualties during operations,” Singh said on Tuesday in an event paying tributes to three CRPF personnel.The three troopers, deployed at a check post, were killed in an attack in north Kashmir’s Handwara town. A section of security officials and experts believes ceasefire violations by Pakistan are a desperate attempt to foment unrest in India. In the security grid, many consider these ceasefire violations an attempt to give a cover fire to help militants crossing over to India.Even on Wednesday, Pakistan resorted to firing on forward areas along the LoC in two sectors of J&K’s Poonch , drawing retaliation from India, a defence spokesperson said. There was no immediate report of any casualty.Cross-border shelling between the two sides was going on till the filing of this report. “They (Pakistan) want the Kashmir issue alive,” Major General (retired) GS Jamwal said. “We should continue to maintain pressure...and ensure we don’t lose our men but inflict maximum damage on them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surveillance-infiltration-behind-frequent-attacks/story-HVMRbcKI3TuWMjNoq7j3ML.html
07-05-2020||India||States increase liquor taxes in bid to raise revenue amid Covid-19 crisis||On Wednesday, the Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka governments decided to increase taxes on liquor and fuel to mop up money to fight the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, a few days after Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal increased taxes on liquor.Delhi has put a 70% cess on all categories of liquor and Andhra Pradesh increased 75% tax on liquor to fund the fight against Covid-19.Several states, including West Bengal, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, on Wednesday reported up to 20% higher excise revenue than usual and said the rush reported on Monday was slowly abating. However, women in Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, Bolangir in Odishsa and in some parts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh protested over the reopening of liquor shops, saying it would derail their families. In West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district, some women wielding sticks beat people queuing outside liquor vends.The Uttar Pradesh cabinet on Wednesday approved proposals making petrol, diesel and liquor costlier to earn an additional Rs 4,429 crore in 2020-2021, said the state’s finance minister Suresh Khanna. He said the price of petrol will increase by Rs 2 per litre from the current price of Rs 71.91 and diesel by Re 1 per litre from Rs 62.86. The new prices came into efffect from Wednesday night. The UP cabinet decided to make liquor costlier by Rs 5 per bottle in case of country made liquor to Rs 400 per bottle (of more than 500 ml) in the case of imported brands of foreign liquor. For brands of regular and premium categories, an additional Rs 20 will be charged on a 180 ml bottle, Rs 30 on a 180 ml to 500 ml bottle and Rs 50 on bottles containing more than 500 ml alcohol, he said. For imported liquor, Rs 100 more will be charged on a 180 ml bottle while Rs 200 more will be charged on bottles between 180 ml and 500 ml. An additional Rs 400 will be charged on bottles that have more than 500 ml of imported liquor.Since May 4, when the liquor shops opened in the state, the UP government has earned revenue of Rs 200 crore. “We got maximum revenue on Wednesday even though there was so much hype on Monday,” an official said. In 2019-20, UP had earned revenue of Rs 27,323 crore from liquor sales against the target of Rs 30,000 crore. Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa announced an increase in liquor prices by 11% and a stimulus package worth Rs 1,610 crore. As a part of the package, the government has decided to pay Rs 25,000 per hectare up to a maximum of one hectare, one time compensation of Rs 5,000 to 60,000 washer men (dhobis), 2,30,000 barbers, 7.75 lakh auto rickshaw and taxi drivers.In West Bengal, a huge rush was witnessed outside liquor stores for the second consecutive day despite the government increasing the prices by 30%. Bengal’s commissioner, excise, Niranjan Das, said the sale of liquor in last two days was about Rs 58 crore, which is slightly higher than normal days.  On average, Bengal gets Rs 25 crore every day from excise revenue. “On Monday, the liquor sale was about Rs 29 crore and on Tuesday it was about Rs 28 crore even though bars and liquor shops in malls are closed,” Das said, adding liquor sale contributes substantially to the state’s revenue.Similarly, revenue from liquor sale has been encouraging in Assam. In three days, the state earned Rs 75 crore as revenue from liquor sales. In March, till the lockdown was imposed, the state earned Rs 65 crore, officials said. In April, due to lockdown, the state had earned only Rs six crore from liquor sales. Rajasthan reported a revenue of Rs 40 to 45 crore on Tuesday and Madhya Pradesh about Rs 40 crore.In Haryana, where shops opened in Wednesday, there were long queues outside the liquor vends in several districts, such as Bhiwani, Dadri, Rohtak and Sonepat districts. However, in many places the vends did because there was not enough stock, officials said. In Uttarakhand’s Nainital, people queued outside a shop, amid a hailstorm, while maintaining social distancing, as the state government reported good increase in revenue. RK Pandey, a resident of Kumaon, who waited for 30 minutes outside a liquor store, said: “Liquor shops were closed for six weeks and people are not sure whether it will remain open tomorrow or not so they are stocking liquor.”There were reports of women protesting against the opening of vends from some districts, such as Uttarkashi and Chamoli. Sunita Negi, head of Virpur village, said, “People have not been working here in the village and nearby villages due to the coronavirus pandemic. The situation will only worsen if liquor shops are opened as the men will spend money on liquor.”Liquor shops remained closed in Jharkhand, Kerala and Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-increase-liquor-taxes-in-bid-to-raise-revenue-amid-crisis/story-TTIPqGrj5yWit5hlkNwJtN.html
07-05-2020||India||Chemists asked to stock up on 55 key drugs given to Covid-19 patients||Wholesalers and retailers of drugs have been asked to maintain stocks of 55 drugs given to Covid-19 patients in intensive care units (ICUs) and 96 medicines used for treating other chronic co-morbidities that increase the risk of complications and deaths. The directorate general of health services (DGHS) has prepared the list and the Drugs Controller General of India’s office has forwarded it to the members of the All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists (AIOCD), an industry body representing pharmacies and wholesalers in the pharma trade. “A detailed exercise has been undertaken by the DGHS which has prepared a list of 55 medicines for ICU management and another 96 drugs for general availability and treatment of various co-morbid conditions, which may be required during these times… In light of this current pandemic, it is absolutely essential that sufficient market availability of these drugs along with other essential drugs is ensured by your members. These steps will go a long way in the effective clinical management of the pandemic,” said a note written by the Union health ministry’s officer on special duty, Sudhansh Pant, to AIOCD.The drugs include vasopressors (used to raise low blood pressure), those used for arrhythmia (for irregular heart beat) and other cardiac emergencies, analgesics (pain killers), sedatives (sleeping pills), muscle relaxants, antibiotics and antimicrobial agents.The list also has an estimate of the consumption of drugs for 10 days in the ICU by one patient, 25 patients and 150 patients. A separate estimate has been given of drugs used to treat chronic health conditions across the country for the next three months.The list also includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as paracetamols, diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen; antibacterial agents such as albendazole, amoxicillin, ampicillin, azithromycin, doxycycline, ofloxacin etc. Other drugs include antifungal, antiviral, gastrointestinal, dermatological and anti-allergic ones, hormones, and vitamins.The estimated minimum quantity to be stocked is as per the World Health Organisation’s recommended quantity per thousand population, which is between 10 and 4000 units per 1000 population. AIOCD, in turn, has sent out a directive to chemists regarding the listed drugs. “…as a precautionary measure, it has been advised to maintain optimum availability of listed 55 and 96 drugs sent to you all beforehand to avoid shortages in case of emergency for ICU patients. Hope you shall circulate this message to all your Chemists and Stockists in your States...,” the AIOCD said in a letter.Retail Distributors Chemists Association president Sandeep Nangi called this a stock-taking exercise to ensure there is no shortage of any essential medicines. “The government does regular monitoring of the inventory. There is no shortage of any medicines as of now in the entire supply chain.”Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, Institute of Critical Care and Anaesthesiology, Medanta Hospital, Gurugram, said these drugs are readily available for patients in ICUs and others and that there has been no shortage. “The list by and large covers all essential medicines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chemists-asked-to-stock-up-on-55-key-drugs/story-3LJ0fTyym8aZXDWXnQYx1O.html
07-05-2020||India||Murdered Delhi cop’s husband kills himself, say police||Nearly 14 hours after a 32-year-old Delhi Police woman constable was found shot to death in a car in Delhi’s Lodhi Colony, her husband, who was the prime suspect in the murder case, allegedly killed himself with his service pistol at Jamalpur village in Uttar Pradesh’s (UP) Meerut Tuesday night, officials of Delhi and UP Police said.Around 11pm, a joint team of Delhi Police’s south district and the special cell was questioning the head constable Manoj’s relatives in the village regarding his whereabouts when they heard a gunshot in a sugarcane field nearby. They rushed to the field and found Manoj bleeding from the head.A bullet entry wound was found in his right temple and his service pistol was lying nearby. The local police were informed about the incident, deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said.Brajesh Kumar Singh, station house officer (SHO) of Incholi police station, said that the head constable’s body was sent to a government hospital for autopsy. “The pistol has been sent to a forensic lab for examination. Inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) have been initiated,” Singh said.On Tuesday around 9am, the body of constable Renu Malik was found on the front passenger seat of a Maruti Ritz car in Lodhi Colony. She was posted to the outer-north district’s Covid cell. The police started working on the theory that her husband, head constable Manoj who was posted to the special cell, had killed her due to marital discord. He was missing since her murder and the car belonged to his colleague.The initial probe revealed that the couple was living separately but was in touch on the phone. Since both of them are dead now, the exact sequence of events leading to their deaths has not yet been ascertained.“Whether the constable was killed by her husband, who then used the same service pistol to kill himself is being probed. He, however, was our prime suspect as all the circumstantial evidence pointed towards him,” DCP Thakur added. Many police officers suspect that the head constable may have killed himself out of guilt. His relatives told the police that they asked him to surrender when he came seeking shelter at their home, one of the officers said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/murdered-cop-s-husband-kills-himself/story-Uktq4oTgz09N7lYJMndRFJ.html
07-05-2020||India||Indian bizman, cook land in Delhi aboard Zambia evacuation plane||When a Royal Air Charters special flight landed in New Delhi on Wednesday to ferry back Zambian nationals from the Capital and Mumbai, it had on board two passengers who were not supposed to be there -- an Indian businessman and his cook.The special evacuation flight was allowed by India’s ministry of home affairs (MHA) to fly back 39 persons including Zambian diplomat Steven Simasandu to Lusaka, but officials at the airport were surprised when the flight, which was supposed to be empty except for the crew, landed with Rajnish Gupta and Suresh Kumar Baheliya, according to people directly familiar with the matter.Gupta, 47, a businessman who has business interests and an apartment in Lusaka, was travelling with Baheliya, his cook. He had managed to convince Zambian authorities to let him fly in on the special flight, which landed in Delhi via Muscat. Gupta told the officials at the airport that he was in Lusaka for work when the lockdown was enforced and that he managed to persuade Zambian government authorities that he had to be back in India. It wasn’t immediately clear how Gupta managed to convince Zambian authorities to let him travel to India. The Zambian High Commission did not respond to calls seeking comment. More than 300,000  Indians are stuck around the world on account of the lockdown and the cancellation of all flights. Starting Thursday, the Indian government is running a massive evacuation operation to get many of them back to India. On Tuesday, the government said it would run 64 flights in the first week, starting Thursday, to fly around 15,000 Indians back home. According to guidelines issued for the operation, preference was to be given to those with expiring visas, people who were laid off, the elderly, students, pregnant women, and people with family medical emergencies.When the plane landed at about 2pm on Wednesday, Indian authorities were shocked to find the two Indians on board because the Directorate general of Civil aviation (DGCA) permit had no mention of any incoming Indian passenger. HT has reviewed a copy of the note . Till evening, the flight, which was to take on Zambians from Delhi and then fly to Mumbai where more Zambians were to board, was waiting on the tarmac, with Gupta and Baheliya next to it. “Someone can’t just get on a plane like this illegally and come here,’’ said a DGCA official. “He will not be allowed to get off the flight.’’But therein lay the big dilemma for the officials. “He (Gupta) is an Indian citizen after all and so we can’t send him back,’’ said an immigration official.And so, as the discussions raged Wednesday evening, Gupta stood on the tarmac, closely watched by two security guards. “Even if he manages to stay back in India, he will face action and will be taken straight to quarantine,’’ said an airport official.After consultations with the Ministry of External Affairs, the immigration officials issued a show cause notice to the two passengers. The CISF which guards the airport were officially told to put the two back on the flight. However, the two were refusing to budge. The Zambian passengers were left waiting till shortly after 11pm, when a quick response team of 20 people surrounded Gupta and forced him onto the plane. Late on Wednesday night, the plane took off for Mumbai to pick up the rest of the passengers before heading to Zambia.The Delhi Airport spokesperson said that he had no information about the incident. HT also contacted the Foreigner Registration Offices which handles the immigration department under the home ministry but there was no response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-bizman-cook-land-in-delhi-aboard-zambia-evacuation-plane/story-Hm2ZGDvIYbDhgxcFktvxuL.html
07-05-2020||India||Ahmedabad under hard lockdown as Covid-19 cases near 5,000||The Gujarat government on Wednesday imposed a hard lockdown in Ahmedabad to curb the spread of Covid-19 and warned off a punishment under the Epidemic Diseases Act for violators. The city has recorded 4,735 positive coronavirus disease cases till Wednesday and 298 deaths. It accounts for 70% of the total 6,662 cases in the state, and 74% of the 396 deaths. According to a government order, everything except ATMs and health facilities will be closed from midnight on Wednesday. Only three transport of milk and vegetables will be allowed, an order issued by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation said. “For effective implementation of social distancing and to minimize crowding to reduce the spread of infection in the city of Ahmedabad, all shops shall be closed except providing only milks and medicines,” said Ahmedabad municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar. “Those failing to obey these orders shall be penalized under section 188 and 270 of IPC and section 3 of the Epidemic Disease Act,” he said.Kumar replaced the former commissioner Vijay Mehra on Tuesday when Mehra was quarantined after coming in contact with a person who tested positive for the coronavirus disease. Ahmedabad is the worst affected district in the state, followed by Surat, which has 772 cases, Vadodara 421, Bhavanagar 82 and Anand 76. Out of these 368 deaths, 273 are from Ahmedabad, 33 from Surat, 30 from Vadodra and rest from other districts.Of all the cases in Ahmedabad, about one-fourth are from Jamalpur, a locality of 3.5 lakh people in central Ahmedabad.“When the first case was reported from Jamalpur on March 19, nobody took it seriously. The person was tested and sent back home. Even contract tracing was not done properly, let alone isolating his family,” said a senior Gujarat government official, who did not wish to be named.The official, who is a part of the team working on containment strategy for Ahmedabad, said the lockdown norms were not properly implemented and there were no efforts to identify those infected. “In the first week to 10 days [of the lockdown], only those who visited the hospital with Covid-19 symptoms were tested. No random testing was done,” he said.Gujarat chief minister, Vijay Rupani in an interview to HT had attributed the high number of cases to large number of international and domestic travelers. “There was a complete ban on movement of people. However, Gujarat is one of the leading states in India with a large number of international and domestic travellers. This increases the possibility of more cases. By the time we registered our first case on March 19, we’d screened around 30,000 passengers and put them under quarantine. We ensured strict implementation of MHA guidelines,” Rupani had said.The chief minister said a large number of people, who attended the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz in New Delhi, came back and by the time the officials could track them, they had already come in contact with a large number of people. “This led to the rise of cases. Another reason for rise in cases is our intensive testing capacity. With a capacity of 3,000 per day, we have tested around 80,000 people till date,” he said.Experts, however, attributed the high numbers to failure to enforce lockdown stricly. Dr Parthiv Mehta, an Ahmedabad based pulmonologist, said, “Enforcement has improved now. We need special audit of all deaths to find out how many died because of co-morbid conditions as Gujarat has high incident of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahmedabad-under-hard-lockdown-as-cases-near-5-000/story-tUEqnMzM61tddtiirzZNFM.html
07-05-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Public transport may resume soon, says Nitin Gadkari||Public transport may resume soon with measures related to social distancing and hygiene in place as the resumption along with reopening of highways will go a long way in instilling confidence among the public, Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said Wednesday.In his address to Bus & Car Operators Confederation Of India members via video conferencing, Gadkari said a standard operating procedure will have to be drafted for operating public transport with social distancing norms and for adopting measures like hand wash, sanitising, face masks, etc. Public transport has been suspended across the country since March when the ongoing lockdown was imposed to ensure social distancing to check the Covid-19 spread. The Centre has made an exception for the operation of bus and train services to enable movement of the stranded people.A ban on regular air, rail travel and interstate transport remained as the Centre extended the lockdown until May 17 last week. Taxi and cab aggregators were allowed to operate with two passengers even as inter and intra-district buses remain prohibited in orange zones.In a statement, the Union road transport and highways ministry said Gadkari assured the operators that the government is aware of their problems and will support them to mitigate their issues. Gadkari said his ministry was looking at adopting the ‘London model’ of public transport, which will involve promotion of private investment in the sector. He added the pandemic has presented India an opportunity to seek global investments from firms looking to exit the Chinese market.The confederation members made suggestions like extending interest payment exemptions, restarting public transport, and deferring state taxes, etc. All Indian Motor Transport Congress president Kultaran Singh Atwal said the transport sector was facing a severe downturn due to persistent lockdown. He said a majority of operators are small and unable to sustain the financial pressure. “The government must extend a helping hand to more than 200 million people dependent on this sector...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/public-transport-may-resume-soon-gadkari/story-NwQ95NOEXXyNgs3vhb260N.html
07-05-2020||India||Congress asks Centre to spell out Covid-19 lockdown exit strategy||Several Congress chief ministers on Wednesday accused the Union government of taking decisions arbitrarily and not consulting them on key issues such as the classification of Covid-19 zones, while party chief Sonia Gandhi asked the Centre to spell out its lockdown exit strategy.In a discussion between Sonia Gandhi, the CMs, and other senior Congress leaders via video conferencing, the demand for a sizeable stimulus package for the states -- to combat the coronavirus pandemic and the economic fallout of the national lockdown -- was also raised, according to the Congress party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala. “What after May 17? What criteria is the government using to judge how long the lockdown will continue?” Surjewala quoted Gandhi as having said at the meeting.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hit back to many of the issues raised, saying the Congress was politicising the Covid-19 fight, particularly at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken along all the chief ministers by holding multiple interactions with them since the start of the lockdown in late March.Modi first announced the 21-day nationwide lockdown to contain the deadly pathogen on March 25. The lockdown was then extended till May 3, and later till May 17, but with several relaxations that first kicked in on April 20 and then at the start of the third phase on May 4.Former prime minister Manmohan Singh, who addressed the meeting, also talked about the path ahead. “We need to know, as Soniaji said, what will happen after Lockdown 3.0? The chief ministers need to deliberate and ask as to what is the strategy of the government of India to get the country out of lockdown,” Singh told the meeting, according to Surjewala.Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said the central piece of strategy to fight Covid-19 is to protect the elderly and those who are diabetic and with heart conditions, Surjewala added.The meeting came days after Sonia Gandhi announced that her party will pay for the train travel of stranded migrant workers -- a move that triggered a slugfest between the Congress and the BJP. The opposition party accused the government of being insensitive to the plight of stranded migrant workers while the BJP claimed that railways was bearing 85% of the fare cost, and state governments had to pay 15%, thus allowing migrants to go back home free of cost.Giving further details of Wednesday’s meeting, Surjewala quoted Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh as having said that his government had set up two committees to strategise on how to come out of the lockdown and on suggesting ways and means for the economic revival. “Our concern is the people sitting in Delhi are deciding on classification of zones without knowing what is happening on the ground,” he said, according to Surjewala.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot demanded financial assistance from the Centre to states to sustain the impact of the Covid-19. “Until an extensive stimulus package is given, how will states and the country run? We have lost Rs 10,000 crore of revenue. States have repeatedly requested the Prime Minister for a financial package but we are yet to hear from the Centre,” Surjewala quoted Gehlot as saying.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said states were facing an acute economic crisis and needed immediate financial assistance. “Chhattisgarh is one state where 80% of small industries have restarted and nearly 85,000 workers have returned to work,” he said at the meeting.Puducherry CM V Narayanasamy said the Centre was deciding on zones without consulting the states. “This is creating an anomalous situation. No state or chief minister is consulted. Why? The Prime Minister is not saying a word on the economic package for states,” he said.The Congress chief minsters also pointed out that the Centre is pushing the states towards the fiscal distress by not announcing and allocating resources to fight the pandemic as also the looming economic crisis. They told the meeting that they will again write to the Prime Minister seeking financial assistance so that the battle against Covid-19 is fought jointly, with the Centre leading it and the states being the executing partners on the ground.Former finance minister P Chidambaram said at the meeting that financial condition of the states was dire but no money was being allocated by the Centre.The BJP hit back on all these issues. “The Congress is trying to create a wedge between chief ministers of the Congress-ruled states and the non-Congress ruled states. At a time when everyone should join forces, questions are being raised about when the lockdown will be relaxed,” BJP spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said.“If the Congress cannot cooperate with the government it should not make efforts to create divisions. The way Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are raising questions every day it is weakening the war against coronavirus,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-asks-centre-to-spell-out-lockdown-exit-strategy/story-N4sRLcw1qiqu5HrxMJbdJN.html

07-05-2020||India||Life in the time of Covid-19: Finding new ways to care, and self-care||When the going gets tough, the tough will somehow get by. But what if you’re at home with a loved one who is frail, aged or ailing? It’s hard being the only caregiver, with little or no help. It can help to create contingency plans, take precautionary measures, and try and build a new support system to replace the one you no longer have access to. And do not neglect to take care of yourself as well.Plans A and BThe most common concern is running out of medication and not being able to fill up a prescription again, or replace an essential device like a pulse oximeter or glucose monitor. Nita Ghosh of Kolkata typically kept her husband’s medication stocked for three months at a time — he has a motor neuron disease. But with stocks running low with suppliers, her own stocks dipped to 15 days’ during the first lockdown. Nita has since expanded her list of stockists in the city, so she doesn’t have to rely on only one.She has also contacted her local police station. On their advice, she sent a photo of her husband’s disability certificate to his physiotherapist in case she needed to call him for a session and he was stopped while in transit.Stepping upFamily members are also learning how to fill in for medical assistants in case they can’t make it. Software engineer Rajeshwari Mitra from Bhubaneswar is helping her ailing father, a neurological patient, with his exercise regimen. “He is bedridden, but my mother and I coax him to sit up and do his stretches,” she says. Keeping up an ailing person’s morale and encouraging him to stick to his routine are essential, when even the local doctor may not be a phone call away.Rajni Aggarwal, who works with an international packers firm in Delhi, lives with her mother who is confined to her bed by rheumatoid arthritis and a spine fracture. There are many factors pulling Rajni down. “The agency that provided attendants is charging double. Stress caused mom to have bladder issues and I began to get nervous. I called two of our local doctors. One said he would a house call, for Rs 5,000,” she says. Her support system came in handy. She did a video call with her friend’s mother, a retired doctor; her medication has calmed Rajni’s mother.During the day Rajni does yoga, listens to music and makes caricatures of herself and her friends which she then shares via WhatsApp. These conversations help lift her spirits, and her mother’s. “I show them to my mom and we have a good laugh,” Rajni says. “In these times, that is so important. It doesn’t make the troubles go away, but it makes them smaller.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/life-in-the-time-of-covid-19-finding-new-ways-to-care-and-self-care/story-pIf44zmoFaWZ5uXayWzTHI.html

07-05-2020||India||‘Have to get used to the virus, expect flights to start soon’: Hardeep Puri||Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri talks about the government’s mammoth plan to evacuate stranded Indians, coordinating with the states to ensure their quarantine, the resumption of domestic flights and public transport in an interview to Anisha Dutta.Edited excerpts: Q: What is the scale of this massive rescue plan that the Indian government is going to begin from tomorrow? You have given an estimate of about 1,90,000 people but there is no clarity on how many stranded Indians we are expecting. The figure of 1,90,000 was a figure which was a working hypothesis for MEA initially. Our missions are in touch with people who have expressed a desire to come back then the missions do an outreach through associations of different Indians and groupings. When we started looking at the mechanics and modalities for the evacuation flights and we started getting into greater detail the first impression that we got was that the overall figure of 1,90,000 would actually be conservative and the figure would end up many times higher than this. The total number of Indian nationals in the Gulf alone goes into several million. Some of them need to come back because they are in distress, some of them have had their Visas expired, some of them are facing deportation and others are in an emergency situation. If you put these together the figure is going to be well beyond 190,000 to 200,000. If it were a normal situation through normal civil aviation operations, you could carry these people back but the fact of the matter is domestic civil aviation and international flights have been under lockdown since March 23, therefore our ability to bring these people back is directly dependent on the arrangements that the state governments can make to receive these people. It is absolutely imperative that all those coming from abroad will have to be subjected to mandatory 14 days quarantine.  Also Watch | New Covid-19 test, invented in India, may be deployed within a monthTomorrow three flights are planned one to Singapore and two to Abu Dhabi. We will see how this process proceeds. How much satisfaction in terms of risk minimization we get. An operation of this magnitude, 190,000 might be the largest and the most comprehensive programme ever attempted and in a difficult operating time when you are dealing with an invisible enemy. In the coming days we will refine the programme for the coming weeks—we will add more countries and add more flights. Q: How long will this take? I am not committing myself to the total number to be evacuated, within how much period of time we do this in will depend on the manner in which we are able to execute this in consultation with the state governments. As far as the civil aviation component is concerned we can ramp that up. We have 650 aircraft at our disposal; some of them are long haul. It depends on the behaviour of the virus and the situation in the states which are receiving these people. We have a plan of the first week to ferry 14,800 people in 64 flights, in the next week we will look at an increase in numbers depending on our experience during this first week. Q: Is there a plan to help NRI’s stuck in India? How does the government plan to ferry them back? All Indian citizens who are ordinarily NRI’s, those who are on long-term work Visas, those who are green card holders etc, yes we would be happy to open the booking for them. But you have to factor in another issue which is that many countries are not receiving or not willing to receive people who are not their nationals. For instance, I thought people from Dubai who are stranded here could be sent back but they are not allowing any foreign nationals to come back even those with long term working Visas. Hence unless these restrictions are lifted by the receiving country the airlines cannot do anything about it. In the United States and United Kingdom there is no difficulty, we are booking people on the outgoing flights. Q: You used the word ‘evacuation’ and you talk about it as a commercial operation as well. What do we call it? Where does it say that the term evacuation means it has to be gratis? Nowhere. Let’s look at this realistically, these are people who went abroad to earn their livelihood, some are in difficult situations because they don’t have jobs anymore but at the same time the state is providing a service through a civil aviation company. That company (Air India) is also being barely kept afloat, it requires an infusion of Rs 500 crore to 600 crore every month to keep up. We are providing a service so we have to levy a charge. There are irresponsible members of opposition parties saying it should be free and well that’s one sure way of running the economy to the ground. It cannot be done free because there’s a cost to it and the charge which has been levied like Rs 12,000 from the Gulf, Rs 50,000 from UK…it is reasonable considering that the flight will have to go reasonably empty one way and it may not be 100% full on the way back. A plan has been devised that they go from the port of embarkation to a pre- designated port of disembarkation and the passengers are taken into government mandated paid quarantine facilities arranged by the state government. Q: Is there a plan now after this to begin rescue flight operations domestically as well as for those stranded in different states? When you have a country like India which has the world’s third largest civil aviation domestic market…pre-Covid-19 we were dealing with 435 million passengers. Obviously, people are stranded, I have been getting requests from people asking when they will resume because they have to meet their family or some other urgency but all these decisions will have to be taken after we factor in the behaviour of the virus. In the process of easing mobility you don’t want exponential growth in the infections. Since the Prime Minister took decisions very early in the day, those were bold and very timely decisions, we were able to control the spread. Today, our overall number is less than 50,000 with a doubling rate of 12-13 days and total fatality is about 1600. Compared to global figures these numbers are more under control and hence we can draw some satisfaction. But in the process of opening mobility there is always a risk whether you are opening mobility through surface transport of different kinds or ship or planes. Hence you have to simultaneously do two things; put in place safeguards and precautionary measures and Standard Operating Procedures and on the other hand you ease mobility. I think we have reached a stage where we will just start getting used to the idea that the virus is going to be around for a while but we will not allow it to completely circumscribe or curtail our normal economic activity which is vital to keep the country going. Q: One sense from the government is that there will be a gradual resumption of services? How will it be done when and if the government decides to allow? The civil aviation resumption of domestic traffic cannot be taken in isolation. When you open up domestic flights you will also have to open up traffic in railways, and other modes of surface transport. Even the Delhi Metro has a ridership of 6.5 million a day and will have to be opened accordingly. It will all be part of a package. My expectation is that we will do it in a slow and calibrated manner. I want to reiterate that the decisions remain to be taken. When they are taken, I expect that we will do it in a gradual manner—first 25% operations then gradually increase. On when will it happen? I am hoping sooner than later but again it is dependent on economic activity. In the last few days a range of economic activities have opened up substantially. In the coming weeks I expect it to be eased and a calibrated opening taking place including domestic aviation and finally civil aviation overall. Q: When can we expect an economic stimulus for the civil aviation sector?I am not in the habit of anticipating what my senior colleague the finance minister is going to say. My ministry and all the senior officials have personally been in touch with all the airlines. We know exactly where they are seeking relief and have brainstormed with them and passed on some of their suggestions to the finance ministry. But the size of the package, stimulus etc is not for me to comment. We have to create an ecosystem so that when the crisis is over we emerge from it stronger. It would mean the amount of damage for the stakeholders in the sector is minimised. The stakeholders are the airlines themselves, the airport operators, the tourism industry etc, who are all at a severe disadvantage right now. But the eternal optimist that I am, I am hoping that we will navigate our way out of this. Some airlines were taking advance bookings and you issued a clear directive to stop and also to reimburse bookings made during the lockdown. Some airlines have opened advance bookings again, how will you control that? It is a very complicated situation, the airline ticketing structure is very complicated where you have passenger as a user, the travel agents and then you have the airline. In the normal system that we follow, which is a deregulated system, the airline is supposed to put on its website its lower fare and the highest fare and then they can charge according to the market mechanism. I realised what was happening pretty early, a lot of people who were in distress because they had booked a flight and it got cancelled due to the lockdown so I issued an advisory saying that people should be reimbursed. When I found that some airlines were not following that, I was compelled to issue a directive. Meanwhile, there are other tickets which people had booked before the lockdown, now there is a demand that they reimburse those also and the matter is before the Supreme Court because someone had filed a PIL. I can’t comment on it because my ministry will have to take a position there. We will have to look at the interest of the passengers primarily but also look at the situation of the airlines. But clearly if a passenger booked a ticket and got affected by the lockdown it should be reimbursed but if he booked in advance; it’s a global practice. Some governments like the European Union and the US have told their regulator to allow refunds. I am sympathetic towards the situation of the airlines but equally conscious about the poor customer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/easing-mobility-should-not-lead-to-exponential-growth-in-covid-19-infections-hardeep-puri/story-TA45esklfKGMvArTR3WRIP.html

07-05-2020||India||Counter Covid-19 with courage, fight like a soldier: Kargil hero||We humans experience the same fears, the same hopes and the same uncertainties. Covid-19 has shown us that what happens to one person can soon affect other beings all over the world. But it has also taught us that courage and compassion can help us overcome any crisis.Triple amputee Kargil war veteran, Naik Deepchand recalls how during the war, soldiers sometimes had no ration, but courage and the spirit of unity kept them going. “India as a nation is trying its best to contain the virus. The crisis shows that we must all take responsibility. We must combine our inner courage and patience with empirical science to protect our future from such threats,” he says. Deepchand says, “Courage is the primary thing. The medicine that can kill this virus is courage. Humein iss mahamaari se ladna hai, darrna nahi hai.”He says that at this moment, the entire nation is united as one. “Unke chale jaane se poora desh pareshan hai, koi nahi pooch raha ki woh Hindu the ya Muslim. Chand logon ne bana diya dushman mazhab ko, farak nahi padta ki kaun Kapoor hai, kaun Khan hai. (The whole nation is mourning Irrfan Khan and Rishi Kapoor’s death. No one’s asking if they were Hindu or Muslim.  Very few people nurture religious hate, it doesn’t matter if one’s a Kapoor or a Khan),” he says.This pandemic serves as a lesson that only by giving up hate and acting with kindness towards all, we can beat the virus. He says, “Our determination made us win the war. The battle against corona is similar, we all are soldiers in this fight and we can win it together.”Being consciously happy even in chaotic circumstances like a pandemic goes a long way to help us cope. He says, “Life is short, so live each moment. Don’t criticise anything or anyone. Listen to your inner voice which is always of love and compassion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/counter-covid-19-with-courage-fight-like-a-soldier-kargil-hero/story-1XtcjcvAHRv7liOujfIi0O.html
07-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Pharma firm seeks approval to conduct clinical trials of hepatitis medicine||Zydus Cadila has sought permission from India’s drugs controller to conduct clinical trials to test the efficacy of its antiviral hepatitis medicine to treat adults affected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The medicine, called Pegylated Interferon allpha-2b, is used to treat viral hepatitis B and C, and other viral liver infections. Interferon has been used in the treatment of Covid-19 in China and Cuba, and is a part of the treatment guidelines of the Chinese government.In a statement, the company contended that its biological therapy, Pegylated Interferon alpha-2b, sold under the trade name PegiHepTM, could emerge as one of the pathways to treat Covid-19 as it has shown to reduce viral load and generate virus eliminating specific immune response in past studies.“The central drugs control department has received an application from them, and it is being considered. However, there has not been any decision taken over it yet,” said a senior official in the Union health ministry who asked not to be named. “We are working with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have opened an investigational new drug (IND) filing for Pegylated Interferon alpha-2b for the treatment of Covid-19. We are also working with the Department of Biotechnology to investigate the role of Pegylated Interferon alpha-2b for COVID 19 and are planning to undertake clinical trials for this,” Sharvil Patel, managing director, Cadila Healthcare Ltd added in the statement.When the human body contracts an infection due to a viral attack, it produces a group of molecules called Type 1 interferons as a first line of defence.Interferon alpha is one such Type 1 interferon molecule that not only slows down viral replication but also helps activate the two arms of the human immune system: innate, for immediate killing of the virus; and adaptive, for long-lasting immunity.In some past studies in the US and China, the medicine has shown to improve the condition of Covid-19 patients.The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, showed evidence of a direct anti-viral effect of interferon alpha against coronavirus in-vitro.The second research by a group of universities in China, Australia and Canada retrospectively analysed 77 moderate Covid-19 subjects in Wuhan and observed that those who received Interferon alpha-2b showed a reduction in the duration of virus shedding period and even in levels of the inflammatory cytokine, IL-6.The study suggested that if a long-acting molecule like the drug is given early on in the infection, the patient suffering from Covid-19 will show improvement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pharma-firm-seeks-approval-to-conduct-clinical-trials-of-its-hepatitis-medicine/story-cKGyKQxpIU1JrfyBTv88sK.html
07-05-2020||India||In fight against Covid-19, increased testing and better infra critical||Diagnostic testing for Covid-19 has been the topic du jour in India – from government offices to boardrooms to online chatrooms. Debates range from whether we are doing enough testing to whether we are testing the right people. Continuous media coverage on availability of test kits, quality of the kits and effectiveness of testing protocols has often led to confusion on how to expand testing capacity.It is now well accepted that we are in a marathon fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. India has been in a nationwide lockdown since March 25 that has been extended twice -- to May 17 -- with some relaxations in restrictions. This was essential and well-timed -- helping reduce the spread of the disease ( the doubling rate of cases, 3.4 days prior to the lockdown, is 11 days currently) and providing time to ramp up the healthcare infrastructure. However, in this battle between lives and livelihoods, we cannot ignore the crippling impact the lockdown has had on India’s economy. Already the unemployment rate has risen to 23%, from 8.4 % in mid-March. Diagnostic testing is an important weapon in this fight. It helps to identify infected individuals and treat them; also it helps in breaking the chain of transmission and supports decision making on easing restrictions. Countries like South Korea have already shown how large-scale testing can control the disease without resorting to a nationwide lockdown.India: Current state of testingCovid testing in India has evolved rapidly. Until mid-March, testing was focused on only symptomatic international travellers or symptomatic contacts of such travellers in the belief that the spread was largely restricted to international travellers. Over time, with identification of cases with no travel-related history, these guidelines evolved to include symptomatic local patients, healthcare workers, asymptomatic contacts of confirmed cases and patients exhibiting SARI (severe acute respiratory infection) and influenza like symptoms. Currently, Indian testing guidelines stand in line with those of countries like South Korea and Germany. With the new guidelines in place, testing has been ramped up by over 35 times during the last five weeks from an average of 2,000 tests / day (last week of March) to more than 70,000 tests (early May). A heartening indicator is that with the scaling-up of testing, positivity rates have remained one of the lowest in the world at -- 4%. This increase has been driven by multiple government interventions. More than 150 testing labs have been additionally approved in the last four weeks. Pooled testing protocols in locations with low positivity rates have been created and testing has been included in the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) package. Shifting to the next gearViewed this way, the overall picture does not seem as grim as many have claimed. However, reviewing the state- wise status of testing, it is seen that there are wide disparities which point to the need for urgent segmented action. Refer to Exhibit 2States in Quadrant I (e.g. West Bengal) are seeing low testing rates despite high positivity and need to immediately ramp up testing to understand the true spread. States in Quadrant II (like Delhi and Maharashtra) show a high spread while having high testing rates. These geographies have had many outbreaks in clusters and need to continue large-scale testing to identify and treat patients. Many states fall in Quadrant III (e.g. Bihar) where testing has been sub-scale. While they currently see low positivity, they need to enhance testing to understand the spread and support decisions to open up gradually.While cumulative cases in India have exceeded 40,000, a granular review shows eight cities contribute over 45% of cases, while 250+ districts have no reported cases. This, in addition to the concentration of growth of Covid-19 in particular areas, allows for a regional review to decide on lifting lockdown restrictions. This could be supported with thorough testing to enable informed decision making.This is where the different available testing options lend themselves to appropriate use cases. We have the gold standard RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) tests that detect the presence of a viral genome in the body; they can be deployed largely in identification of infected patients and treatment. These are expensive and need specialised molecular diagnostic equipment and trained professionals to operate the equipment. On the other hand, serological tests detect the presence of antibodies (that develop in the body as an immune response) and are useful to detect past infections. While such tests are less useful in immediate response (and should not be used for clinical diagnosis), they can be used to track disease development. They could also assess individuals who are immune and can be safely brought back to the workforce. Antibody kits were added to our testing regime, but were challenged due to a few faulty kits. With additional kits getting approved, the quality of test kits should be regularly confirmed through periodic quality checksWe should think of these tests as weapons in our arsenal, and deploy a segmented approach for testing in India, which is customized by region depending on the current level of disease spread. See Exhibit 3 * High disease spread and high growth: Continue large scale RT-PCR testing to support identification of cases. Deploy rapid testing in hotspots to quickly assess community immunity* High disease spread but low growth: Leverage combination of antibody tests to test herd immunity coupled with RT-PCR tests for diagnosis* Low disease spread and high growth: Leverage pooled testing at scale to quickly identify new hotspots* Low disease spread and low growth: Leverage RT-PCR tests for Influenza-like-illnesses /SARI cases and healthcare workers and serological testing to monitor disease surveillanceOperationalising the ramp-upThe testing value chain is complex and has several bottlenecks. Starting from sample collection where it is crucial to ensure availability of skilled phlebotomists (people trained to draw blood from a patient) with full protective personal equipment (PPE). Subsequently, the lab testing process requires availability of technicians with training in molecular biology, infrastructure such as biosafety rooms, sufficient kits and reagents and finally RT-PCR machines – the most critical equipment needed in the current molecular testing regime. While government interventions have ensured sufficient supply of kits (with enough stocks to conduct 100,000 tests / day for the next two months and ramp-up beyond this as needed), PCR machines, sample collection process and regional lab availability may emerge as future bottlenecks. Given this, it is recommended to focus on four priorities:* Lab Capacity: Address regional disparities in lab capacity. States like Jharkhand and Chattisgarh have less than five labs while labs in Gujarat are near capacity with current disease spread. Private sector collaboration can help plug these gaps * PCR machines: ~400 PCR machines are available in approved labs in India currently. This is sufficient to conduct 70-80,000 tests / day in the public sector and 30-40,000 tests / day in the private sector. The positive side is that India already has a sufficient installed base (1400+ machines) across public and private sector and capacity can be ramped up even more by adding these machines to the approved list* Setup of fever clinics to enable sample collection: Taking learnings from South Korea and other countries, India should set up fever clinics in each locality to do screening and sample collection* Leverage innovations: Innovations like pooled testing, nano-reaction based tests and RT-LAMP {Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification) technology could further enhance capacityDiagnostic testing is crucial to the fight against Covid. As we move into a post-lockdown era and contemplate recovery, government officials, corporate leaders and healthcare experts will all have to confront the need for testing. Unfortunately, it is neither simple to implement nor a panacea to all problems. It will be important that all stakeholders (public and private sector) work jointly to address this challenge and bring forth their respective strengths to help win this fight.

07-05-2020||Editorials||Respect the human rights of migrant workers | HT Editorial||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-sparked migrant worker crisis took a new turn when the Karnataka government cancelled special trains to take the workers to their home states on Tuesday. The decision came after chief minister BS Yediyurappa met construction industry representatives, who expressed concern that work will grind to a halt if workers left. The CM defended the decision, saying the state is providing facilities to the workers, including Rs 5,000 to all registered workers. He has also announced a Rs 1,610 crore stimulus package. But facing criticism, the government backtracked and decided to resume train services on Friday. The controversy brings to light the crucial role played by migrant workers in sustaining India’s economic engine. But this cannot come at the cost of curtailing the individual liberty of workers, and their ability to exercise free choice. Karnataka’s initial decision showed that political regimes are indifferent to the needs of migrant workers — who are often caught in exploitative work arrangements. These workers have been stuck for close to 50 days, with a severe shortage of money and food. They are desperate to return home, to their families and communities, in search of a degree of psychological reassurance. The decision to step back in the face of rising hostility from workers, and criticism from across the spectrum, is positive. For, at the core, this is not about economics but fundamental human rights. Migrants must be allowed to choose whether they want to stay or leave. Forcing them to do stay reflected a tendency of treating workers as bonded labourers. By listening to feedback and changing course, Karnataka did the right thing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/respect-the-human-rights-of-migrant-workers-ht-editorial/story-slvrPGRRtnXdeDQbKkQ96I.html
