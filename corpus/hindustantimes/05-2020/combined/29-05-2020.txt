29-05-2020||News||Decoding the India-Nepal dispute | Opinion||Things are not looking good in the Himalayas. And it’s not just because of India’s longstanding border dispute with China and recent skirmishes along the Line of Actual Control.On Tuesday, Nepal’s Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli convened an all-party meeting seeking a consensus on amending the constitution to include the strategic northwestern tri-junction with India and China – Kalapani, Limpiadhura and Lipulekh – within Nepal’s territory. It could turn out to be a significant political move, though the amendment has not yet been endorsed by Parliament at the time of writing. Oli obviously wants to negotiate with New Delhi from a position of strength. Nepal maintains that the 1816 Treaty of Sugauli, ratified by both sides, designates the (Maha)kali as the boundary river. It considers the treaty as the only authentic document on boundary delineation and all other documents as “subsidiaries”. A lot has changed in Nepal since India’s defence minister Rajnath Singh opened the track linking India and China through the disputed territory on May 8. Battling for political survival amid a serious intra-party feud, the issue with New Delhi has given Oli a new lease of life. For the second time since 2015, New Delhi’s foreign-policy decisions have buttressed Oli’s nationalist credentials. Here’s a bit of election history. In 2017, Oli’s party, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) rode to power on a strong nationalist wave, following India’s undeclared border blockade to express its displeasure over the new constitution that it believed wasn’t inclusive enough. After a formal merger between his party and Prachanda’s Maoist party, Oli now heads Nepal’s strongest government in 30 years. If Indian pressure increases, there is a strong possibility that Oli’s nationalist position will trump all intra- and inter-party differences, eroding all nuances. Nepal could yet again be pushed towards China. As of now, Nepal’s strategic community and political leaders are at least wondering why China in 2015 agreed with India to allow the construction of a link road through the disputed Lipulekh. Is China telling us the full story? Does it consider its ties with Nepal independent of its ties with India, an Asia-Pacific power? In 1963, when Nepal and China signed a border agreement, the two sides decided to remain “open” to Nepal’s both northwestern tri-junction (where Kalapani lies) and for the northeastern tri-junction to be discussed at some point with India. The Indo-China border war had just ended, and there was too much acrimony for all three sides to sit down for talks, recalls Bhek Bahadur Thapa, who was a Nepal government secretary then. When Thapa became Nepal’s ambassador to India in 1997-2003, then prime minister IK Gujral and his counterpart in Nepal formed a joint team at the foreign secretary level to settle outstanding border issues. When India published a new map in November last year unilaterally, with the Kalapani region within its terroritory, the Nepali side felt that the move breached the status quo and international conventions on the disputed border, argues Thapa. From Nepal’s viewpoint, if inaugurating the Lipulekh track traversing a disputed territory in the middle of a pandemic was bad enough, the Indian Army chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane’s claim that Nepal was acting at “someone’s behest” – a clear reference to China – only added to the complications. The Indian position is that the new map was published in light of Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir’s changed status as a Union Territory and that the disputed region has always beenin its possession.As both sides dig in their heels over cartographic interpretations, a political solution is the only way out. The recent border agreement between India and Bangladesh offers a good example. Prime Minister Narendra Modi got much of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc), and certainly, Nepalis, excited over his “Covid-19 Diplomacy” on March 15 when he convened a videoconference inviting the leaders from the region to work together. But the initiative was subsequently sidetracked due to India’s own battle against the pandemic and, now, upended with the border dispute. All this while, China is seen as being largely successful in containing the outbreak. President Xi Jinping is reasserting himself politically internally and China is projecting its power externally. Nepal continues to import urgent medical supplies from China. The pandemic offers India, a regional power in its own right, a similar window of opportunity to make its presence felt in the region. A strong case can be made for greater engagement with Nepal, given our vast open border and strong people-to-people ties. Nepali professionals who worked alongside their Indian counterparts after the 2015 earthquake still recall their familiarity of each other’s languages, cultures and even standard operating guidelines (for example, during medical treatment). New Delhi and Kathmandu need to immediately engage with each other through public diplomacy to bring down the temperature. It could even mean establishing communications at the highest level — between the prime ministers. And with the populations reassured, they can then let their respective bureaucracies handle the issue.Many in India’s strategic community believe that Oli is playing up the “nationalist card” for his political survival. Some in Nepal also offer a similar analysis. If that is the case, it is all the more reason to resolve the border dispute early. India’s future response will significantly shape the emerging narrative in Nepal. The main opposition, the Nepali Congress and other parties — the Janta Samajbadi Dal, and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party — want to be seen as independent contributors to the solution, instead of giving the impression that they just followed Oli. A hardline approach by New Delhi will further strengthen Oli. India has a difficult choice to make.

29-05-2020||News||Documenting the story of India’s migrant distress | Analysis||Ever since the lockdown began, stories of migrant workers have haunted the country. These stories of suffering and hardship have become the face of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India’s megacities. There is an eerie similarity to many of them, highlighting an unequal society that has caused a humanitarian crisis to erupt during an unprecedented health crisis.Earlier in the lockdown, one of us noticed two children who lived on the construction site next door. They said nothing and asked for nothing, but there was hunger and curiosity in their eyes. They were the children of Ranju, a migrant worker from Bihar, who worked at the construction site. The pandemic had brought work to a standstill for her and 15 other Bihari workers — no wages, little food, and no cooking gas. An economic package has since been laid out. Yet, labour distress continues.Why did the migrant workers make the punishing journey from big cities back to the nondescript towns and villages of largely Bihar, and in Uttar Pradesh (UP)? The following narratives from Poorvanchal (eastern UP and Bihar) prove the need for a nuanced understanding of the precarity and anxieties of the migrant workforce and the need for State policies that take this into account. The two states account for 37% of the country’s inter-state migrants whose lives and livelihoods are now uncertain, at least for the near future. We spoke to dozens of workers and community leaders to understand their anxieties and experiences and policymakers to understand their responses.Migrant workers across the country had similar worries. The absence of basic amenities, the inability to feed their children without ration cards of the particular geography they were locked down in, and the lack of a security net to protect themselves from Covid-19 made them desperate. Worse still, the persistent fear of eviction played on their minds through the day, while mosquitoes bit them through the night. There was no spare money to purchase soaps, sanitisers, or the most essential product of the times — masks. Their economic insecurities persist despite government action in recent weeks.Take some examples from Sitamarhi and Madhubani, Bihar. Rajesh worked at a construction site; Rajkishore Ram, Fenkan Raut, Manoj Manjhi, and Roshan Ram were labourers in a shoe factory, and Subhash Sah was a fabricator in another factory. None of them received their wages. The situation was worse for seasonal migrants who oscillated between their home and the destination states. Amar Singh, an agricultural worker in Gorakhpur, who doubles up as a painter in Delhi, travelled 900 kilometres on a motorcycle, only for his village to chase him away. Those arriving from the city were reported to the police and the pradhan, the village chief.In Riwilganj, Bihar, the quarantine centre in the Simariya School provided respite to those who had returned. Food was provided thrice a day. A mosquito net, a towel, and bathing items were also given. But it was life beyond the quarantine that worried them — for no one knew where they would find work.Their fears are for the immediate and long-term. Estimates of unemployment from the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy exhibit a dire situation. Bihar has had one of the highest rates of unemployment in March and April. While the average unemployment rate for the country was 23.5% in April, Bihar’s unemployment figure was as high as 46.6%. Uttar Pradesh is relatively better, with 21.5% unemployment rate in April.Many of these workers escaped the serfdom in villages and flocked to cities only to be forced to restart work in villages, in farms and brick kilns, now that the pandemic rages on. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) is now the bulwark for rural employment. In April, nearly 856,773 households demanded employment in Bihar. Of this, only 73% of households could get work. Of the 1,113,644 households in UP that demanded work through MGNREGS in April, only 67% were given work. With hundreds of thousands likely to be added to the workforce in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the demand for MGNREGS is expected to see a sharp rise. Generating work and ensuring regular payments will be a challenge. Bihar has a built-in disadvantage due to extensive landlessness — 80% of rural migrants are either landless or have less than one acre of land.Yet, despite precarious work in cities, no secure wages, and little social support, India’s poorest workers have acted with restraint, still following, within their constraints, norms of social distancing.Pandemics may have historically offered opportunities for labour to bargain for higher wages and better conditions. In India, the pressures from maliks (bosses), the pervasive informalism of new economy jobs that lead to no recognition for labour, and the urban middle-class’s assertions for exclusion of the urban poor are part of a larger problem. Opportunities are difficult in conditions of inequalities and assertions of power. India must do better, starting with inclusive urbanism and policy reforms premised on an ethic of labour care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/documenting-the-story-of-india-s-migrant-distress/story-sVC8sCHFetXYBPKLa1OhZM.html
29-05-2020||City||Plumber travels on truck from Maharashtra for 5 days to reach West Bengal||The only reason 27-year-old Salim Laibh and his family travelled by truck for five days to reach their village in West Bengal, is that they had run out of options. “We ran out of money and other essentials that are necessary for everyday life,” said Laibh, who is now at an isolation centre in Bengal’s Cooch Behar district.Laibh lived with his brother, sister-in-law and their one-year-old daughter in a chawl in Panvel. Before the lockdown left him without work, he was a plumber associated with a number of housing societies in the area. As Covid-19 spread, the Laibhs grew nervous. Not only were they stretched for cash, every day there were rumours of people from their chawl contracting Covid-19. When the Shramik Special trains were announced in early May, Laibh was initially hopeful. “It is not that I didn’t try to travel by train, but for a long time the police officers kept saying the trains are not going to Howrah as of now. So, the registration process couldn’t be started,” said Laibh.Ultimately, the family decided to travel by truck. “We coughed up ₹3,500 per head to travel to the village,” said Laibh, adding that their departure was delayed because there were “many cancellations”.On May 17, Laibh, his brother, sister-in-law and their one-year-old daughter, began their journey to Bengal on a small truck crammed with 20 others like them. The truck would be their home for the next five days. The journey took longer than expected because the truck driver chose a roundabout route to avoid being detected by cops. Occasionally, they would wait for sunset so that they could evade highway patrols.There wasn’t enough space for all of them to lie down so the travellers set up a rotation system: some stood for hours so that others could stretch their legs, and then others stood so that the first group could lie down. “Among so many people, nobody knew who might be infected. We were all terrified,” said Laibh.In addition to the summer heat, there was soon a shortage of food. Most of the shops along the highways were closed because of the lockdown. “While we could bear the heat and hunger, the little one was cranky throughout the way,” said Laibh, remembering his one-year-old niece. “She was not drinking milk. It was really difficult to manage her,” he said.The only respite came once the sun set. Laibh remembers sitting in the truck and waiting for the cool breeze at night.The Laibhs reached their village on May 22 and have since been living in a school that has been converted into the local isolation centre. Laibh hopes to come back to Mumbai soon.“I have a very small plot here. But farming is not enough. There is no industry. I will definitely come back once the situation is normal in Mumbai,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/plumber-travels-on-truck-from-maharashtra-for-5-days-to-reach-west-bengal/story-stixeEcfPx4rYx57GBliFJ.html
29-05-2020||Mumbai||SevenHills nurse assaulted in Wadala, three booked||Three members of a family were booked by Wadala police on Friday for assaulting a 21-year-old nurse working with SevenHills Hospital in Andheri (East) with a wooden bat. According to Wadala police, the incident took place on May 24 after the nurse scolded the 10-year-old daughter of her neighbour for stopping the nurse’s two-and-a-half-year-old nephew from entering the house saying he would spread Covid-19.The minor was stopped because the nurse was working at a hospital which was treating Covid-19 patients, said police officers. “When the neighbour, Ahmed, heard his daughter being scolded, he came out, abused the nurse and told her that it was because of her that the virus was spreading. Later Ahmed’s wife Hajra and daughter came out and assaulted her,” said a police officer.The accused pulled her hair and banged her head against a wall, then Ahmed got a bat from his house and hit the nurse. The nurse suffered injuries to the right side of her head and admitted to KEM Hospital till Friday, added the officer.Shahaji Shinde, senior inspector at Wadala police station, said, “We had initially registered a non-cognisable offence after her mother complained. On Friday, the nurse came to the police station and recorded her statement. We have registered an FIR under sections 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons), 504 (intentional insult, and thereby provoking any person, intending or knowing it to be likely that such provocation will cause him to break the public peace), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, and are investigating the case.”After the nurse shared her video with head injuries on Twitter, BJP MLA Ram Kadam tweeted the video which went viral on social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sevenhills-nurse-assaulted-in-wadala-three-booked/story-fcuNucEfsSASW0R16lH94N.html
29-05-2020||Mumbai||No pilgrimage to Pandharpur this year; state to ferry ‘padukas’ by road or air to keep up tradition||There will be no ashadi wari or pilgrimage to Pandharpur this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but to keep up with the age-old tradition the state government has worked out a compromise to ferry the ‘padukas’ by road or air to the temple.In a meeting held on Friday between deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and trustees of Alandi, Dehu and Pandharpur temples and other district officials, it was decided that the procession on foot will not be carried out. Every year, lakhs of devotees of the warkari sect go on a pilgrimage by foot to Vithoba temple in Pandharpur from Alandi (place of worship and samadhi of Sant Dyaneshwar) and Dehu (place of worship of Sant Tukaram) ahead of Ashadi Ekadashi.However, as all religious events and celebrations have been banned in public due to Covid-19, the government did not want to allow a procession of lakhs of devotees on July 1. Warkari sect is a religious movement traced to the Bhakti tradition which has a large following in Maharashtra. “Ashadi wari is an age-old tradition and we want to ensure that it is not broken. The government will ferry the padukas (footprints of saints) of all those trusts and organisations that are so allowed by district collectors, superintendent of police etc, by air in helicopters or by road in buses to Pandharpur a day before Ekadashi. The final decision on going by air will be taken depending on the weather forecast then,” said Pawar.He said, “No procession or palki will be carried out without permission from district collector. Everyone should take darshan of the deity on TV sitting at home.” He also thanked the trusts for taking a pro-active role. “We welcome the decision taken by the government,’’ said Vikas Dhage Patil, trustee of the Sant Dyaneshwar Maharaj Trust Committee.BJP state chief Chandrakant Patil said, “We welcome the decision of the government to take the padukas of the seven palkis to Pandharpur by road or air. Devotees must follow the government guidelines during the Covid-19 pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-pilgrimage-to-pandharpur-this-year-state-to-ferry-padukas-by-road-or-air-to-keep-up-tradition/story-RNWdJFkriGIMSQB0VtYBpO.html
29-05-2020||Delhi||How community radios are helping fight Covid-19||It is a sweltering afternoon and Imran Khan has just started another episode of ‘Corona Se Jang, Radio Mewat Ke Sang’, a live programme, in his thick Mewati accent. “You are listening to Radio Mewat 90.4MGz. With you is your friend Imran Khan. Namaste and aadaab to all of you. Today we have with us psychologist Satish Kaushik. We will talk to him about the mental stress caused by the ongoing coronavirus crisis.”Imran is a reporter and presenter at Radio Mewat, a community radio station in Mewat, one of over a dozen such stations in and around Delhi that have been airing special Covid-19 community-oriented and community-produced programmes.In fact, community radios such as Radio Mewat and Alfaz-e-Mewat, which together broadcast to over 300 villages in Mewat, bordering Gurugram, have served as important sources of information and a bridge between the community and the local administration during the coronavirus crisis. This is important in a region where literacy rates are among the worst in the country and owning a television is looked down upon for religious reasons. Last year, Mewat district (now officially called Nuh) was Haryana’s only district to figure in the Niti Aayog’s list of the 111 most backward districts of the country.In the past two months, Imran, one of nine reporter-presenters, including two women, at Radio Mewat, has been shuttling almost every day between Mewat’s villages, government offices and hospitals, conducting interviews with local authorities, doctors and the village sarpanch. “We have been at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19 in the Mewat region. Being a community radio, it is our duty to keep the community informed during the pandemic, and bring their concerns to the fore,” says Imran, who hails from Gandhi Gram Ghasera, a village in Mewat named so because, after Partition, Mahatma Gandhi had visited Ghasera village in December 1947 to convince the local Muslim community to stay in India.“Senior district officials see us as partners in fighting Covid-19 in the region and often call us to record their messages. We were able to build trust between the locals, most belonging to the ethnic Meo-Muslim community and the administration,” adds Imran, who often walked 7km from his village to reach the radio’s studio in Nuh town during the lockdown. Sohrab Khan, 46, another reporter-presenter, says calls from the listeners at the station’s landline phone have increased manifold, with callers asking all kinds of questions about Covid-19. “We have tied up with several doctors and other experts who answer their questions during our live and recorded programmes,” says Sohrab, who is currently hosting a programme on the problems the migrants who have returned to villages in Mewat are facing. “I am taking their issues to elected representatives and the local administration, both personally and through my programmes.”Farheen, 21, one of the two women at Radio Mewat, who hosts ‘Hinsa Ko No’, featuring stories of domestic violence, says that a lot of women have been calling to complain of domestic violence during the lockdown. “They say that their husbands are home all the time and beat them over small things like cooking, often threatening them with divorce. We try to counsel these women, and in many cases, personally visit them to resolve the issues. Besides, a lot of women call us with questions about pregnancy and delivery during the lockdown,” says Farheen, who has studied up to Class 12. “It feels great when women in villages recognise my voice and often compliment me. I am happy that my parents allowed me to work as a reporter, ignoring protests from my relatives, in a conservative region where women are not allowed to step out.” Archana Kapoor, founder, Radio Mewat, says the radio’s programmes during the Covid-19 crisis have been aimed at awareness, prevention and safety of local communities. “Besides, we have also been fighting myths, misinformation and rumours that spread fast in this area,” says Kapoor.Alfaz-e-Mewat, the other community radio in the region too has been an important platform for villagers in Mewat to access information and public services in times of Covid-19. It has its studios in Ghaghas, a village tucked deep in the heart of Mewat, with the Aravalli range of mountains forming a beautiful backdrop. It has four reporters/radio jockeys, including a woman reporter, all of whom belong to nearby villages.When the first lockdown began, the radio station started a special programme ‘21 Din 21 Baatein’ (21 Days, 21 Messages) followed by another programme ‘19 Din Aur Sambhalke’ (Be Careful for Another 19 Days) as the lockdown extended. Every day, the station broadcasts three hours of Covid-19–related programmes such as ‘Gaon Ki Chaupal’ and ‘Aaj Ka Hero’, the story of an individual adopting best Covid-19 preventive practices.“We have also aired several folk songs in local languages around themes of social distancing and isolation to educate people. In ‘Gaon Ki Chaupal’, we regularly provide information about various government schemes during Covid-19 such as the direct transfer of ₹500 to women who are Jandhan account holders under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PM-GKY), and the increased wages under MGNREGA, and how to get work under it. We are villagers’ friends and guides, and they trust us since we are from the community,” says Shakir Hussain, 30, a reporter and RJ with Alfaz-e-Mewat. “These days a lot of our listeners complain that my voice has changed for the worse. I explain to them it could because I speak with a mask on. I never imagined that a mask would come between an RJ and the mike,” says Hussain. The radio’s other popular Covid-19 programmes include ‘Saavdhan’, which warns people against fake news about Covid-19 on social media.The local administration is all praise for the community radios in the area. “They have a great connection with people in the Mewat region, and they help us quickly put out updates and stop rumours. During the lockdown, whenever needed, I simply called the stations and recorded my messages, which were played immediately on the radio. Their programming is in local languages and for them, local issues are most relevant,” says Pankaj (known by his first name only), the deputy commissioner of Nuh district.Beyond Mewat too, there are several community radio stations such as the Noida-based Salaam Namaste and the Gurugram-based Gurgaon Ki Awaaz that have been running a range of Covid-19-related community-oriented programmes. Salaam Namaste, the first community radio station of Noida and Ghaziabad, has been airing programmes such as ‘Doc on Radio’, which offers free tele-consultations with doctors; ‘Health From Home’, a programme providing tips by pulmonologists on the prevention of Covid-19 and ‘Corona Salaam,’ aimed at distance education for local underprivileged children. “There has been a 40% increase in our listenership during the Covid-19 crisis. We host a mix of health and education programmes and worked closely with local communities as well as RWAs,” says Barsha Chabaria, station head, Salaam Namaste. There are around 300 community radio stations across the country. Last week, Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar interacted with these community radio stations, praised their role during the pandemic, and promised to unveil a plan for the expansion of community radios in the country. “We mostly depend on donations; what we need is financial support to stay alive,” says Kapoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/how-community-radios-are-helping-fight-covid-19/story-ayZfnpitU3OMoG8FYoRVoM.html

29-05-2020||Mumbai||Discharged after testing negative, cop dies within hours||Two more police personnel, constables from Dahisar and Bandra police stations, succumbed to Covid-19, taking the toll in Mumbai Police to 16. So far, 25 police personnel from the state have died of Covid-19.The 53-year-old constable from Bandra police station had tested positive on May 16. He was admitted to a Covid care unit in Worli and discharged on May 28, after he tested negative for Covid-19. His health deteriorated within hours of being discharged. He was again rushed to Nair hospital around 1am on Friday, where he passed away. “We are conducting an inquiry,” said Naval Bajaj, joint commissioner (admin).A video of the constable walking towards his home in a fragile state, while being applauded by residents, went viral. One of his colleagues raised questions over his discharge. “What was the hurry to discharge him? Also, the ambulance did not drop him till home. He had to walk a long distance to reach home. He was weak and unable to walk,” he said.The constable is survived by his wife and two children, aged 20 and 19.The second constable, from Dahisar police station, was admitted to JJ hospital, but was never tested for Covid-19. “The 53-year-old had gone on leave for 10 days. He started suffering from breathing issues and was admitted to JJ hospital. He died on May 26, after which his swab samples were taken. His reports came positive on May 27,” said Hanif Mujawar, senior inspector of Dahisar police station.He is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son.Till Friday morning, 2,211 personnel have been infected, of which 970 have recovered. Of the 2,211, 1,962 are constables.Meanwhile, till Friday, 800 trains have been operated to facilitate return of 11.5 lakh stranded migrants to their respective states, a senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer. Only those who want to go to West Bengal are left in Mumbai owing to the Cyclone Amphan and would be sent soon. With very few migrants left, registration of applicants for Shramik special trains has dropped drastically. “Some of the stranded migrants who had registered themselves for Shramik special trains are now backing off and opting to stay back in the city as their employers have assured them regular supply of food and work. On Thursday, 11 trains were to be run from Mumbai, but as migrants backed off, only three trains were operated,” said a senior police officer.Amitabh Gupta, principal secretary (special) and head of the three-member committee formed for stranded migrants, said, “The Mantralaya staff (over 1,400 state government employees), who were given the task to assist police force in registration process of migrants, have been asked to return to their office after May 31, as very few stranded migrants are left.”Also, a total of 28 FIRs were registered on Thursday against 76 people, of which 47 were arrested for lockdown violations. A maximum of seven FIRs were for not wearing masks and six for gathering in one place. Another 12 FIRs were for different types of violations and three were against shops operating despite being non-essential services. Nine FIRs each were lodged by south and central region, while six of them were in west region. Remaining few were in north (1 FIR) and east region (3 FIR).Thirteen members of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) from Andheri were booked by Andheri police station for protesting outside BMC ‘K-East’ ward office complaining against unavailability of beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/discharged-after-testing-negative-cop-dies-within-hours/story-l0i5Kp5ZDrcB2bl3KN00AJ.html
29-05-2020||Mumbai||Congress, BJP trade barbs over fares of special trains for migrants||The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders traded barbs at each other again on Friday over the issue of ticket fares of Shramik Special trains for migrants travelling back to their hometowns. Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on Thursday in an affidavit had informed the Supreme Court that the entire cost of the tickets for the Shramik Special trains is being borne by states. He has also alleged that the information submitted to the court exposed the Modi government, as its ministers and BJP leaders have been claiming that the Centre is bearing 85% of the ticket fare.Sawant said,“BJP’s hypocrisy has been exposed and party state president Chandrakant Patil should immediately apologise to the people for the false claim he made.” Sawant’s statements were countered by former Mumbai BJP chief and senior leader Ashish Shelar, who termed the Congress leader was a “factory of blatant lies” and the fresh allegation was also a part of it. “The cost to run a train ranges between ₹30 lakh and ₹50 lakh, depending on the distance it covers. The running cost per passenger and the current fare charged for each passenger travelling on the Shramik trains is in the ratio of 85:15. Even in the information submitted to the court, Tushar Mehta has clarified that the entire ticket fare [which is 15% of the cost of running a train] is being borne by the states. This mathematics cannot be discussed in the court as everybody is aware of it and even railways officials have clarified it time and again,” Shelar said.Union ministers Prakash Javadekar and Nirmala Sitharaman, as well as Patil, had also earlier reiterated that 85% of the fares of the trains had been borne by the Centre. Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh and transport minister Anil Parab had then lashed out at the Centre and claimed that the entire cost of the ticket fare had been borne by the state. The state government has made a budgetary allocation of ₹100 crore for the cost of ticket fares for migrants and claimed that it has sent more than 10.5 lakh migrants back to their home states in over 650 trains departed from various stations over past three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/congress-bjp-trade-barbs-over-fares-of-special-trains-for-migrants/story-m0ZK8XpAIMmzYhQuR5dHMJ.html

In a bid to tackle the problem, not-for-profit group Project Mumbai collaborated with the civic body to launch a website to help patients suffering from health problems other than coronavirus to find a bed at a hospital near them.Project Mumbai’s website currently lists 46 hospitals across the city, with details of the facilities (paediatric, neurology, oncology, orthopaedic and dialysis) provided by them as well as the availability of beds there. The list is updated twice a day. Shishir Joshi, the founder of group, said there are 25 volunteers working with him, and the list is updated twice daily. “While most of the hospitals are currently occupied by Covid patients, other patients don’t know how and whom to approach in cases of other medical emergencies. So we decided to get a list of hospitals from BMC [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation] which can cater to other patients and contacted them. Every volunteer is assigned with three hospitals and they remain in touch with the officials of the hospital,” said Joshi. He said they were provided with a list of around 75 hospitals by BMC, of which 46 agreed to be a part of the initiative. “The list will be updated if more medical institutions reach out to us. We provided our contact details to them. It is a completely free service,” Joshi added.A fellowship student with BMC, who helped Project Mumbai with the information, said it was a joint initiative of fellows working for government organisations and the group.“A friend’s mother passed away after she failed to get timely medical help because hospitals don’t accept patients without Covid test. That’s when some of us, who are working as fellows for the government, informed BMC and provided Project Mumbai with the information of these hospitals,” said an associate working with BMC. He added that there are plans to provide this information on BMC’s Covid helpline 1916 in the coming days, once the number of queries related to coronavirus is brought under control. “We are swarmed with Covid-related queries on the helpline. So if Project Mumbai is able to reach out to non-Covid patients , then it is a welcome step,” said a fellow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/volunteers-of-a-group-in-mumbai-launch-website-to-help-non-covid-patients-find-hospital-beds/story-YV1eW0Qsc74ma8I1gjpg9K.html

He was on oxygen support for six days. “I am lucky I am back. My three Covid-19 test reports were positive. I suffered from pneumonia, which affects the lungs. Thane police commissioner V Phansalkar and my colleagues used to call me every day. I have started visiting areas in Mumbra where I am creating awareness about the virus.”“I was taking all precautions before I came positive and even now. Asymptomatic people are dangerous carriers. I was taking vitamin C, using sanitizer and several other precautionary measures while on patrolling duty. I am doing the same now, including government’s suggestions such as ayurvedic tea, mask and social distancing. Have just added pranayam to my routine. I know people still don’t follow social distancing rules. I am doing my duty with energy to make sure at least 10 people are saved from contracting the infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/first-cop-from-thane-to-test-positive-resumes-work/story-rvY64Nr69rUEV6XJSWrJFK.html
29-05-2020||Delhi||46k construction workers traced so far for re-registration in Delhi govt’s monetary aid scheme||The Delhi government has so far traced around 46,000 construction workers in the city — who had failed to renew their registration with the welfare board for construction workers and, hence, fallen off the radar – and initiated their registration process, a senior official said on Friday.The official added that apart from this, around 15,000 other workers have so far applied to be enrolled through a portal, which was opened by the government last week.Between application and registration, there is a process of screening of documents and physical verification.Construction workers enrolled under the government’s welfare scheme are being given a monthly financial aid of Rs 5,000 – under guidelines issued by the Central government – for the ongoing lockdown that has been in place since March 25 to check the spread of Covid-19. The welfare board has so far transferred Rs 5,000 for the months of April and May each to around 40,000 registered workers, a senior government official said.Delhi’s labour minister Gopal Rai said, “The Delhi Government launched a website last week for registration of construction workers in the city. We have received very good response. The applications are being screened. We will soon be starting a verification drive following which the workers will be registered. The Covid-19 crisis has severely affected the livelihoods of many construction labourers and the Delhi government is taking all possible measures to support them.”On May 21, the Delhi High Court had said that construction workers in Delhi, who fell off the safety net under the watch of the city’s welfare board, cannot be deprived of benefits just because they were unable to renew their annual registrations.The court had then directed the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board — which comes under the labour department of the government – to take steps to renew the membership of all workers in order to ensure that the associated benefits can help them cushion the loss of earnings caused by the restriction on activities under the lockdown.As on September 30, 2018, Delhi government records showed, the Board had around 5,40,000 registered construction workers.For the past one week, the government has been sending text messages in Hindi to the registered mobile numbers of construction workers whose names and contact details are registered in the state database. Following this, around 46,000 workers have so far approached the labour department by responding to the messages, said a senior government official.Meanwhile, around 15,000 more workers filled up the 12-page application form through the government portal. “Most of them are not digitally literate so they often take help of employers or small-time cyber café owners in their neighbourhood, paying anything between Rs 300-500. Some trade unions have requested the government to rather conduct a survey of construction sites and carry out the registration drive physically,” said Animesh Rai, a labour activist and member of Delhi’s minimum wages committee.Every state has sets of welfare schemes for construction workers, funded by cess collected from construction projects under the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Cess Act, 1996. Under the law, a building worker is eligible for registration under such scheme only if the person has been engaged in construction work for not less than 90 days during the last 12 months. The registration has to be renewed annually.The application requires Aadhaar card details, Aadhaar numbers of their family members; present and permanent address proof; address of the last workplace where the applicant worked over 90 days; name and contact details of the contractor; details of the registered union of which the applicant is a member; colour photographs of self and family members; and details of bank account, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/46k-construction-workers-traced-so-far-for-re-registration-in-delhi-govt-s-monetary-aid-scheme/story-ARp20drZx3CqxJky12dsbL.html

It has directed to invoke the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to imprison repeat offenders from now on. Repeat offenders can face jail term from six months to a maximum of two years. The decision was taken in view of the fact that spitting in public will further spread Covid-19 infection.State public health minister Rajesh Tope said despite people being prohibited from spitting in public, they spit and attract fines under existing laws. “Spitting is also contributing in spreading Covid-19. Considering this, we have decided to implement the prohibitory laws more strictly. Repeat offenders will be jailed for a minimum of six months,” Tope said in his live address on Friday evening.The state government has already prohibited spitting under Bombay Police Act. Following Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COPTA), 2003, the state has also prohibited also smoking and a ban was also imposed on manufacture, storage, distribution, transport and sale of tobacco, scented supari in 2013. The offenders are currently fined ₹1,000 to ₹5,000 for first three offences of spitting and smoking in public following provisions under Bombay Police Act.Considering the pandemic, the health department has decided to invoke the Epidemic Diseases Act and IPC for strict implementation of the laws. Under section 269 of the IPC, offenders will have to face up to six months of imprisonment or fine or both, and under section 270, offenders will have to face prison term up to two years or fine or both, states the order issued by the state health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/spitting-and-smoking-in-public-may-land-you-in-jail/story-5tS281rfZVbtTkKBUSyWwL.html

Rahul Narvekar, BJP legislator from Colaba, will be leading the agitation, along with other legislators from the area.“It will be a silent agitation until our demands are met. The BMC and the state have failed to address the issues of unavailability of beds in hospitals, inadequate testing and there are inconsistencies in BMC’s testing guidelines. BMC’s helpline 1916 has also been unable to provide hospital beds or ambulances to critical patients,” Narvekar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-bjp-leaders-to-stage-silent-agitation-against-state-bmc-over-their-handling-of-covid-crisis/story-BgJhCuScNcPk3KUghGzxuN.html

The condition for this ex gratia or insurance is that the employee should have been on duty for 14 days prior to her hospitalisation or death. The medical certificate for such an employee is done by a government notified lab.However, this will not applicable to those covered by the Union government’s insurance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/50-lakh-insurance-for-all-covid-workers-govt/story-f6JR1mRtt00GPX8CSN1fhJ.html
29-05-2020||Mumbai||Can’t set up Covid test centre in each district: Govt to HC||Maharashtra government on Friday informed the Bombay high court (HC) it was not possible to set up full-fledged Covid-19 testing facilities in all districts and added that the government is fulfilling the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to have one testing lab in a radius of 250 kilometres. The submission from the state in an unsigned note drew displeasure from the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and Justice KK Tated.The court questioned the state on how it could put such a submission when the effects of the virus was widespread and said it was an ‘irresponsible’ statement. The bench further sought the presence of advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni. The advocate general admitted that it was wrong and that there should be testing facilities in each district, following which the court told the advocate general that such an approach by the state was not acceptable and asked for a responsible official to respond to the issue next week.The state submission came as a response to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Khalil Ahmed Hasanmiya Wasta, a 58-year-old fisherman from Ratnagiri, who prayed for a full-fledged Covid-19 testing laboratory in Ratnagiri. The PIL claimed a testing facility was needed in the area as around 60,000 people had come back to the Konkan region which includes the districts of Ratnagiri, Raigad and Sindhudurg, from Mumbai and Pune since the government had allowed intra-state travelling. The petition went on to claim that before the travel ban was lifted there were only seven cases of Covid-19, which has increased to 108 since.The petition claimed that swab samples had be to send to Sangli and Miraj which are around 237 kilometres away from Ratnagiri, which led to a delay in results, thereby endangering the lives of locals.The state in its response informed the court that the work to set up a testing lab at Ratnagiri Civil Hospital was already underway as per a government resolution dated May 25, and that it would be functional within eight days.The state went on to submit that new laboratories could not be set up instantly as there were severe constraints in terms of availability of technical infrastructure in each district, and that as per ICMR standards a lab is required only in those areas where there are more than 100 suspected cases per day. The state, hence, claimed that there was no need to have a testing facility in each district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/can-t-set-up-covid-test-centre-in-each-district-govt-to-hc/story-bg7wT5ddqQbHM040JWEKpL.html

On May 7, HT had reported about how a group of youngsters, who identified themselves as Dharavi Boys, started a donations campaign to feed needy families in Dharavi who had no money and food at their disposal with Covid-19 cases in the slums rising day by day. The group has, since then, managed to get donations from across the world, with a lot of funds also pouring from abroad. “They have managed to feed hundreds of families since then and will continue to do so in the coming days. There are a lot of challenges in food distribution considering that most of their homes are tiny and the food supplies which are bought cannot be stored in big quantities. But they are still managing it very well,” said Stanley Anto, a Navi Mumbai-based activist who has been helping the group. In the last few weeks, the boys have also started taking up other activities like creating awareness drives and distributing masks and sanitisers. In the coming days, they plan to sanitise the tiny alleys of the congested slums where nearly 10 lakh people live. “Now we want to address other issues of health and sanitation also in addition to catering to the hunger problem. People here need a lot of help and support because there is so much fear around the disease,” said Vikas Jaiswar, a 24-year-old member of Dharavi Boys. As of Friday, there were a total of 1,715 positive cases reported in Dharavi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/group-raises-5-3-lakh-to-feed-needy-in-dharavi/story-6wcr2boe4HOmPMkaUVsUsO.html
29-05-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra may curtail its monsoon session to 4 days, take it online||In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the state government may curtail its monsoon session to four days and hold it online. It is scheduled to be held from June 22, as announced earlier. With the state under a lockdown for more than two months, and the restrictions likely to continue for a few more weeks in Mumbai and other cities, the state legislature and government has started to deliberate on plans for the session. The state legislature is looking at conducting it online, to reduce the footfall on Vidhan Bhavan premises, by allowing only a limited number of ministers and legislators. “We are looking at all options, including holding it online, partially online and in a staggered manner. Various online platforms are being tested for safety and efficiency too. Deferring it for a few more weeks is also an option, as the session can be held any time before September 14 (six months from the previous session). Conducting the session is necessary for budgetary provisions for Covid-19 related expenditure,” said an official from the parliamentary affairs department. The official said another problem is accommodation for legislators coming to Mumbai. He said that after Manora guesthouse was demolished a few months ago and the availability of flats at other guesthouses has reduced. “Availability of hotel rooms too seems to be difficult at present,” he said.Assembly Speaker Nana Patole met Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla early this week and discussed the options. “We may hold it at the Central hall for two days each for the Assembly and Council to maintain social distance. Conducting it online looks difficult. We may restrict entry and attendance of legislators and staff to ensure minimum possible footfall the premises and even in the houses. The final decision about the date and the ways it be conducted will be taken during the meeting of the business advisory committee on June 9,” said Patole. The state legislature has begun the proceedings required to conduct the session. The ballot for the choice of the questions to be raised was conducted through Zoom App recently. Meanwhile, Nana Patole rubbished the claim of change of guard in Maharashtra Congress. “This is not the right time to make any changes to the party leadership in the state,” he said. There were reports that Patole is likely to be appointed the state president and former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan is likely to replace him. Chavan too has said that he was not aware of any such move under consideration by the party leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-may-curtail-its-monsoon-session-to-4-days-take-it-online/story-J0lHYU1h6EYqVmBWw1lX0I.html
29-05-2020||Mumbai||Water quality improved at coastal areas, Mithi river got more polluted during lockdown period: Report||Water quality at major beaches in the city witnessed an improvement during the lockdown. However, the Mithi river was more polluted than in pre-lockdown months and the corresponding period last year. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) released the water quality analysis of major rivers and coastal areas in and around Mumbai in April on Thursday.MPCB measured pollution levels using the water quality index (WQI), which provides a single number (grade) on overall water quality that is location and time-specific, and based on specific parameters (see box). While 38 or less is ‘bad to very bad’ or heavily polluted (red), 38-50 is ‘bad’ or polluted (orange); 50-63 is ‘medium to good’ or non-polluted (yellow); and 63-100 is ‘good to excellent’ (green). The Mithi and Mahim creek, into which the river flows, were the only two listed water bodies in the ‘heavily polluted’ category with pollution levels at 25.7 and 37.4 (red category). Versova, Juhu, Nariman Point, Gateway of India, Malabar Hill, Girgaum Chowpatty, Haji Ali, Shivaji Park Dadar and Worli Sea Face all recorded levels ranging from 51 and 58 (yellow category or non-polluted) in April. During January and February 2020 as well as in March and April 2019, Mahim creek was in the orange category while Mithi was in the red category. MPCB said there was an overall reduction in sewage load at marine outfalls. “There was a reduction in untreated domestic sewage coming from large hotels, offices, industries and activities from other establishments that were all shut during the first phase of the lockdown. Also, existing sewage treatment plants (STPs) functioned at optimal capacity along marine outfalls to treat waste efficiently, which was only coming from slums and households,” said YB Sontakke, joint director (water quality), MPCB.Prior to the lockdown, 2,671 million litres per day (MLD) of domestic waste was being generated in Mumbai of which 2,016 MLD was treated before being released into the sea, according to MPCB. This means 25% of the city’s sewage is entering the sea without any processing. “During the lockdown, total sewage generation fell by 450-500 MLD while the gap in treatment continued to be 25%. However, the daily sewage load entering Mithi was over 300 MLD,” said Sontakke.He added that water pollution in Mithi River continues to be a serious issue for Mumbai. “Owing to lesser water flow due to less desiliting activity during April, stagnation of water and low dilution led to higher pollution levels,” said Sontakke. “We are checking with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) regarding desilting work and progress before monsoon.”A senior BMC official said, “Owing to lockdown restrictions, there was hardly any desilting work done during April (in the Mithi) but 80% work has now been completed. The May water quality should show an improvement for Mithi.” An independent expert said MPCB’s findings could be accurate, but the sample collection source needed to be checked. “Coastal water quality during pre-monsoon months is generally poor for Mumbai. The findings show a marked decline biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) — indicating the level of oxygen that aquatic life need for survival — and nitrate levels in coastal waters during April, which fell below safe standards due to less sewage load,” said professor AD Sawant, water quality analyst and member of Supreme Court committee on Mithi River rejuvenation. “The installation of STPs along Mithi River need to be expedited and all desilting activities need to be completed to ensure increased river flow and dilution to curb pollution,” said Sawant.Meanwhile, the water quality at Ulhas River, a major river providing water to Mumbai metropolitan region also improved to a non-polluted status based on samples collected from six regions along the river. “Apart from a drop in industrial effluents, other activities such as washing of vehicles, jeans washing units, service centres etc. all stopped, improving Ulhas water quality,” said Sontakke. However, other industrial zones like Tarapur MIDC, Rabodi nullah etc. recorded higher levels of pollution.Fewer water samples were collected during March owing to travel restrictions during the lockdown, while samples for May are being collected and published soon, said Sontakke.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/water-quality-improved-at-coastal-areas-mithi-river-got-more-polluted-during-lockdown-period-report/story-Q11XF5NrRWfV4xCV0M0g3O.html
29-05-2020||City||JNU begins taking exams online, students report difficulties||New Delhi: Students from the Jawaharlal Nehru University’s School of Environmental Sciences (SES) on Friday began their end-semester examinations in online mode amid the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Out of the 13 schools in the varsity, SES was among the five which opted for the online method while deciding upon the modes of exams in April.“The faculty decided to conduct the exam through the online mode (email), even for the remaining students whenever they are able to appear. Most of the courses are going online or via email, and the faculty is able to transfer the knowledge through e-mode. It was decided that any students who miss the exam can appear later whenever the new date of (exams for) remaining students is announced,” the university had said earlier, in reference to the alternative academic plans for this year.Upon receiving the questions, students were asked to write the exam and send the answer sheets to their respective teachers by email within 24 hours. The 24-hour time frame was given keeping in mind the intermittent internet connectivity in some places.Students, however, said this was not enough. “There are students in Kashmir who don’t have the internet. We have students from other remote areas as well. The other students are not opposed to the move since they are getting 24 hours to complete the paper. This will enable them to secure passing marks more easily and ease their anxieties about the future. But online exams like these will reduce the quality of education and knowledge that we will be passing out with,” Raj Maurya, a PhD scholar and a student councillor at SES.Alaka Patra, a first-year PhD scholar from Odisha, is among the students facing issues in online exams and has written to the dean of SES, where she studies. “I was visiting home only for a week when the lockdown was announced. I don’t have my laptop and other reading material with me. Due to Cyclone Amphan, things have only worsened.”Patra said that even to send emails or download study material, she has to walk around her terrace for network. “I haven’t been able to look for reading material to write my paper due to an irregular network. Due to the cyclone, mobile network and electricity have also been intermittent. To write papers in such a situation is extremely challenging,” she said.SES Dean Umesh Chandra Kulshrestha, however, said exams have been conducted smoothly so far. “If any student has been unable to appear for their exam, we will look at the reason behind it and discuss at the faculty meeting and with the vice-chancellor. If the issue is genuine, we will help the student and retest might be taken.”Vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar said the school had taken a “leap” in using digital platforms and lauded teachers and students “for this progressive and timely approach.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jnu-begins-taking-exams-online-students-report-difficulties/story-MBEFQmCMr6gnI0H58T22HP.html

He entered the campus only a few days ago and his tests came positive two days ago,” said A K Suresh, deputy director of the institute. He added that the staff member died late on Thursday and the municipal officials were informed.“The BMC officials have taken care of sanitisation and requesting quarantine to whoever was in contact with the deceased,” he added.The institute stated that they have been very strict about keeping their campus safe for its residents, including over 5,000 staff members and less than 100 students. “We are sure this staffer did not contract the virus from the campus because he had entered the campus only a few days ago and was already showing symptoms of the virus,” added Suresh.In the first week of May, IIT-B authorities confirmed that the wife of an employee who worked as a health worker in a government hospital and had likely contracted the virus from a Covid-19 patient. Her husband, who is an IIT-B employee and their two children were quarantined while the wife was moved to a hospital for recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-bombay-campus-records-its-first-covid-19-death/story-4nkduWy251N0QMR6bd4dZJ.html

29-05-2020||Mumbai||Authorities step up efforts as new locust swarm enters Nagpur district||A new swarm of locusts entered Nagpur district on Friday forcing district officials to step up efforts to tackle the short-horned grasshoppers.The swarm in Vidarbha districts since May 24 has affected 135 hectares of fruit orchards and vegetable farms, said officials from the divisional agricultural department. However, the state agriculture department said there had been no damage to productive crops so far.“We were informed by our field officers that a fresh swarm entered from Amravati district into Katol tehsil, Nagpur. An existing swarm in this region was reported from Mauda tehsil (around 30 km from Katol),” said Ravindra Bhosale, divisional joint director, agriculture. “We are moving teams to carry out pesticide spraying across both areas as soon as we get the exact location where the swarms settle for the night,” he added. Around 50 hectares of fruit orchards, mainly oranges, and 35 hectares of vegetable farms have been affected across Katol, Kalmeshwar and Parseoni tehsils in Nagpur district. “There is minimal damage to vegetables, while locusts have been eating leaves of fruit trees, which would have otherwise fallen during flowering. Thus, farmers have not faced any economical losses so far,” said Bhosale, adding that these were just preliminary assessments.Subhash Nagare, divisional joint director agriculture (in-charge of Amravati) said close to 50 hectares were affected across Morshi and Warud talukas in Amravati district. “These are mostly orange orchards where pesticide spraying has been carried out. However, the situation is under control, with less number of locusts on Friday.”Suhas Diwase, state agriculture commissioner, said, “There is no crop damage anywhere in the sub-divison. Eating leaves across orchards does not amount to productive damage and loss of vegetables is minimal. Actual damage cannot be assessed in such circumstances. The entire machinery is busy with control measures. There are no instructions from the state so far to assess productive damage.”Meanwhile, the Maharashtra forest department has alerted the Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR) and buffer areas to inform authorities if they spot swarms. “This was done after receiving reports of locust swarms present in Parseoni and Ramtek tehsils of Nagpur, which are close to forest patches,” said Ravikiran Govekar, field director, PTR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/authorities-step-up-efforts-as-new-locust-swarm-enters-nagpur-district/story-ayjWaYR68UpKT1hSrQ3roL.html
29-05-2020||Mumbai||2002 murder case: Perjury proceedings against cop for failing to identify killers||In a rare instance, the Bombay high court recently ordered perjury proceedings against head constable Deepak Trivedi, who, as an eyewitness, failed to identify the men who murdered builder Swapnil Shirke alias Pintu, 30, on the premises of the sessions court in Nagpur in June 2002.Trivedi was the lone policeman escorting Shirke, an accused in a murder case, to the court. He was chased on the premises and stabbed multiple times by 10 men. Trivedi, too, was injured and hospitalised in the attack.In 2017, a division bench of the Supreme Court had dismissed an appeal by the accused and upheld the life sentence awarded to Congress corporator Vijay Krishnarao Mate and six others, including Raju Bhadre, Kiran Umrao Kaithe, Dinesh Gaiki, Umesh Dahake, Ritesh Gawande, and Kamlesh Nimbarte, by the Bombay high court. Four others arrested in the case were acquitted for want of evidence.In 2015, the Bombay high court while sentencing the accused to life imprisonment had initiated perjury proceedings against Trivedi for failing to identify the accused in the case, claiming the incident had happened 10 years ago. The HC had issued show-cause notice to the constable asking him why he should not be prosecutedTrivedi in his response to the high court notice had stated that he committed the mistake of not identifying some of accused because a period of ten years had lapsed when he testified before the trial court. He had sought pardon on the grounds that he had put in 22 years unblemished service and had been compulsorily retired.The division bench of justice NW Sambre and justice NB Suryawanshi took the notice into consideration while ordering the prosecution. “High court cannot be a silent spectator where stinking facts warrants interference in order to serve the interests of justice,” noted the bench, adding, “If this court remains oblivious to the patent facts on record, it would tantamount to failure in performing its obligation under the law.”High court, however, refused to accept the explanation. “We are not convinced that because of lapse of 10 years, some mistake has taken place while identifying some of the accused and that the said mistake was not deliberate or intentional.”The bench said being a responsible policeman on duty and as the deceased was in his custody on the court premises when he was brutally murdered, being the eye witness, Trivedi was duty-bound to tell the truth before the trial court. “However, he resorted to falsehood and hence, we are unable to accept the explanation offered by him.”The bench also rejected the arguments advanced on his behalf that the high court had no authority to order prosecution for perjury. “This Court not only has the authority to exercise such jurisdiction, but also has an obligation to exercise such power in appropriate cases,” said the bench. “Looking to the facts of the present case, in our considered opinion, this is a fit case to exercise such jurisdiction, so as to maintain the majesty of judicial process and the purity of legal system,” noted the bench, while ordering for his prosecution.Case BackgroundSwapnil Shirke, an engineering graduate, wanted to start his own business and had ventured into real estate. With his uncle Ranjit Shirke, he had decided to develop a 21-acre plot at Sakkardara. Swapnil had formed a cooperative society under the name Bhagyashri Cooperative Society in 2001 to develop the land which came as succession from the erstwhile royal family of Raje Raghuji Bhosle. Then sitting Congress corporator Vijay Mate had allegedly encroached upon 7000 square feet of the land in the property that belonged to Shirkes, and when Shirkes had tried to settle the dispute amicably, Mate had asked Swapnil to stay away from developing the land which set of an ugly war between them.On July 18, 2001, Mate was allegedly shot at and his confidante Sanjay Gaikwad was killed. Swapnil was arrested as the main accused in the case. It was in this case that Swapnil was being produced when Mate engineered an attack on him in broad daylight and killed him.The Nagpur police arrested 17 accused, including Mate, who surrendered himself before the police. A sessions court in Nagpur sentenced eight persons including Mate to life imprisonment, while it acquitted seven others in the case in October 2013. An appeal before the Bombay High Court sentencing 12 people in the case while acquitting three others in 205. The accused then moved an appeal before the Supreme Court while sentenced seven people including Mate to life imprisonment while it acquitted four others. One accused Raju Gaikwad is still wanted in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2002-murder-case-perjury-proceedings-against-cop-for-failing-to-identify-killers/story-WENQZH47wy3hyiosdA7JBM.html

29-05-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: NIA court rejects interim bail plea of activist Sudha Bharadwaj||The special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Friday rejected the interim bail plea of activist Sudha Bharadwaj, an accused in Elgar Parishad case.Bharadwaj moved the bail petition on health grounds after a prisoner and a jail doctor at Byculla jail, where the activist is lodged, were found infected with Covid-19. In her plea, Bharadwaj stated that she was suffering from several pre-existing medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and high blood pressure and is at a high risk of contracting coronavirus in prison. It was also argued that Bhardwaj has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis in the past, which makes her particularly susceptible to contracting other respiratory infections.The plea was objected by special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty on the grounds that the accused in the case are booked under the stringent provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and thus cannot be released on interim bail as stated by the high-power committee of the Bombay high court. The prosecution also submitted that the prisoners are getting all the facilities and treatment for all ailments inside the prison premises.Bharadwaj, along with other activists, was arrested under UAPA and the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for allegedly having links with Maoists and being involved in the Elgar Parishad gathering on December 31, 2017, which triggered caste-based violence at Bhima Koregaon in Pune the next day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-nia-court-rejects-interim-bail-plea-of-activist-sudha-bharadwaj/story-uQDHrVKVl3ItJ6tK8rbwDK.html
29-05-2020||City||Three hospitals sealed in Thane over complaints of not admitting patients||Thane Three private hospitals in Mumbra were sealed on Friday and criminal cases were registered against them after a rise in complaints against the hospitals of refusing admissions to emergency patients, including pregnant women.The directives to file the cases were given by Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) commissioner Vijay Singhal.“We have registered cases against three hospitals, Bilal Hospital, Prime Criticare Hospital and Universal Hospital from where we received regular complaints. These hospitals rejected patients despite beds being available or charged exorbitant fees from poor patients, including pregnant women for admitting them.We have registered criminal cases against these hospitals and also sealed them,” he said.Mumbra residents have alleged that these incidents have become common as private hospitals are constantly rejecting patients or charging them exorbitant amounts as fees to conduct Covid-19 tests. A 28-year-old woman, who was six months pregnant, died on May 26 after several private hospitals refused to admit her. A few days ago a 13-year-old girl also died when refused treatment for a liver ailment. Singhal added that in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, hospitals were given guidelines to admit patients and a notice regarding the same was also given to them.TMC has started the work of setting up its third 1,000-bed hospital in Maulana Abdul Kalam Azaad Stadium in Kausa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-hospitals-sealed-in-thane-over-complaints-of-not-admitting-patients/story-oNbB4AjaWk6pQ81Kk8dtNI.html
29-05-2020||Mumbai||Air India medical dept urges management to repeal transfer of doctor accused of alleged sexual misconduct||Regional heads of Air India medical department have appealed the airline management to repeal the transfer of an alleged doctor who has a sexual harassment case pending against him. The doctor had been transferred to Hyderabad from Mumbai by the ex-chairman and managing director (CMD) Ashwani Lohani after a female colleague complained of sexual harassment at the workplace. He has now joined the airline headquarters in Delhi as a general manager. The doctor, who has the rank of a senior official, was transferred and given higher responsibility on May 13. Senior airline sources said that despite an ongoing sexual harassment inquiry, Air India asked the officer to join his duty in Delhi as the executive director (ED) of the medical department is retiring on Sunday, and the transferred officer will be heading the department after him. While the airline spokesperson on May 15 had said that they wouldn’t comment on the matter citing ‘internal issues’, the spokesperson had called the transfer of senior officers to be a routine administrative exercise as per administrative and operational requirements.Lohani had earlier endorsed a report that stated that the officer has a ‘negative attitude’ and has an ongoing sexual harassment inquiry against him. In a letter written to airline management (HT has a copy of it) on May 16, the doctors of Air India stated: “...the said official has been vindictive, vengeful domineer who has an extremely negative attitude, insults everyone at the drop of a hat, belittles colleagues and juniors.”It further added, “We are privy to the humiliating experiences to our lady colleagues and the lady patients in the guide of his cheap remarks and inappropriate jokes. Most of these ladies contract doctors are forced to genuflect as they are scared to lose their jobs due to his explicit hints of contract termination.”Requesting to repeal the said officer’s transfer, the airline doctors added, “Heads hang in shame as this doctor bearing the cross sexual harassment will now lead us for the altar of medical headquarter, Air India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/air-india-medical-dept-urges-management-to-repeal-transfer-of-doctor-accused-of-alleged-sexual-misconduct/story-N116hVL48xMHIuB32zdoqN.html
29-05-2020||Mumbai||HC extends fee reimbursement benefit to backward category students of minority institutes||A three-judge bench of the Bombay high court on Friday struck down a government resolution (GR) issued by the social welfare and special assistance department in February 2013 that restricted the benefit of fee reimbursement to backwards category students admitted to professional courses through common admission process (CAP) conducted by the state government.The bench comprising justice Amjad Sayed, justice Dama Sheshadri Naidu and justice Prakash Naik heard a petition filed by 26 students, belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Class (OBC), who are pursuing engineering courses at DJ Sanghavi College of Engineering at Vile Parle.The petitioners, like thousands of others, were denied the benefit of the fee reimbursement scheme for backward category students, as they were not admitted through CAP conducted by the government. Being a linguistic minority institution, Sanghavi college admits students from the pool of common entrance test (CET) conducted by the government, but by conducting its admission process - as is done by several other linguistic and religious minority institutions. The deemed universities conduct their own CET and own admission process.They had challenged the GR primarily on the ground that the distinction made between CAP and non-CAP students for fee reimbursement was not based on reasonable classification and had no nexus to the object sought to be achieved, and therefore, it was discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. They argued myths that there was no reason to deny the benefit to backward category students admitted to unaided minority institutions.The state government responded to the petition stating their CAP was transparent, well-documented and well-regulated.Besides the policy decision involved financial implications and therefore beyond the scope of judicial review.The bench, however, rejected the government’s stand. It said both admission processes were legal and permissible. “Both the admission processes have judicial imprimatur and statutory sanction,” said the court. “The CAP colleges and the non-CAP colleges take the students from the common merit pool of CET. A method of admission cannot be treated as legal for one purpose and illegal for another purpose.”“Here, the students legitimately, lawfully get admitted through the institutional method (non-CAP) of admission. They suffer no discrimination otherwise on that count. Then, we fail to understand how the Government can brand non-CAP admission as deficient for extending a beneficial scheme,” the bench said while striking down the GR.Moreover, the bench said, the decision contained in the GR was not merit-based. “It is simply disability-based—the social disability of caste,” said the bench - indicating that there was no distinguishing factor between admitted the CAP and non-CAP CAP students to extend the benefit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-extends-fee-reimbursement-benefit-to-backward-category-students-of-minority-institutes/story-phokdnq8MgPbFR4F8tcv9H.html

29-05-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19 cases in Gurugram cross 500-mark||The city’s Covid-19 cases breached the 500-mark after it recorded a spike of 115 fresh cases on Friday. This is the biggest number of coronavirus cases to have been recorded in a single day. Gurugram’s Covid-19 count stands at 520, as per the state health bulletin. It is the highest in Haryana so far.Of the total cases, there are 293 active patients, while 224 have been discharged after the recovery from the highly contagious disease. On Friday, 31 patients were discharged. The death toll stands at 3, as per the health bulletin.The district health team, however, did not share the details of the fresh cases and the areas from where they have been reported.The city saw a massive surge in Covid-19 cases in May as compared to April. On May 1, the total number of coronavirus positive patients was 71. In a month’s time, 449 new cases have been reported. On Thursday, the city recorded the second-highest spike of 68 cases. The positive cases were reported from more than 30 areas.A member of the rapid response team said, “The 115 cases are from different parts of the Gurugram block. It includes areas such as DLF-4, Rajeev Nagar, Surat Nagar, Nathupur, Sector 10A, Sector 18 and Hari Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, among others.” He said that the reported cases are all fresh ones and not holdover cases, refuting to all the rumours that the sudden spurt in the number is due to addition of cases that have been in the backlog.Official data till May 28 showed that some of the worst-affected areas are Dundahera (19 cases), Rajendra Park (12), Khandsa (32), Sector 10A (19), Rajeev Nagar (10), Ravi Nagar (10), Jyoti Park (9), Chakkarpur (7), Gandhi Nagar (6) among others. All of these areas are residential in nature with dense population. A few of the condominiums in the city have been equally affected where patients have been kept under home isolation.With the surge in the number of Covid-19 cases, the district administration has started paid isolation facility for asymptomatic cases. At least 12 hotels have been roped in for the purpose.The city also reported the third Covid-19 death in Medeor Hospital on Thursday. “A 65-year-old woman with co-morbidity issues succumbed to coronavirus,” said the rapid response member. Earlier this week, two deaths have been reported in PGIMS, Rohtak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-19-cases-in-gurugram-cross-500-mark/story-OKE5NrzgBuqjKaAYOrXNMI.html
29-05-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Mobile shop owner with ‘links’ to gangster shot dead in Sector 9||A 38-year-old city-based mobile shop owner, suspected to be a close associate of gangster Binder Gujjar, was allegedly shot dead in broad daylight in Feroze Gandhi Colony, Sector 9, on Friday afternoon. According to the police, the assailants fired at least 27 bullets at the victim’s car as he was on the way to his office.The deceased has been identified as Vikas Dureja alias Vicky alias Anda, a mobile shop owner based in the Baldev Nagar area. The shooting has raised concerns regarding resurgence of a gang war in the city amid the lockdown, the police said. A day earlier, at least three men had shot dead a 22-year-old man in Shiv Park. The police, however, denied that the incident was related to any gang rivalry, and said that they were probing all angles, including the role of liquor mafia.Police sources said that Dureja was a close aide of gangster Binder Gujjar, who was arrested in 2019 by the Mumbai crime branch for his alleged involvement in several murder and extortion cases. Gujjar was also allegedly a conspirator in the encounter of rival gangster Sandeep Gadoli. Their turf war had allegedly resulted in several murders. Gujjar’s brother Manish, a liquor trader, was killed in a gang war in 2016.According to the police, the Friday’s incident was reported around 2.45pm when Dureja was going to his office in his white SUV (Creta). At least three suspects in a Scorpio car blocked the Dureja’s SUV, the police said, adding that most of the suspects were armed.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the victim tried to reverse his car to escape but he hit a dead-end and the Scorpio rammed into his car from behind.“A preliminary probe suggests that the suspects got out of the vehicle and surrounded his car from three sides. The bullet holes on his car suggest that the suspects fired at him through the windshield and the co-driver’s seat. It is premature to say that the murder was orchestrated due to gang rivalry,” said Sangwan, adding that there was no eye witness in the case and the police could not recover CCTV footage of the incident.The police said that the victim sustained multiple gunshot wounds all over his body and died on the spot. According to forensic analysis, the bullet casings indicate that the cartridges used in the pistol were of 9mm, .32 bore and 7.62mm. Several crime teams are working to trace the suspects, said the police.A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said that Dureja had borrowed money to run several allied businesses, including property and real estate. “He also owed money to some people, who were involved in illegal liquor trade. During the lockdown, the liquor mafia had been operational in the city. The murder could be related to some of these dealings,” said the police official.The police said they have registered a case of murder on the statement of the victim’s wife. In the statement, she said that her husband had gone for work around 2pm, and around 2.40pm, she received information that he had been shot dead. She did not name any suspects in the complaint, the police said. The case was registered under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code and the Arms Act at New Colony police station on Friday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-mobile-shop-owner-with-links-to-gangster-shot-dead-in-sector-9/story-HzJXFf49j4ME1lERrSV1SL.html

29-05-2020||City||Gurugram: Web portal for movement passes faces technical issues, commuters left hassled||Gurugram: Those needed movement passes to commute between Delhi and Gurugram were left in the lurch after Haryana’s web portal to apply for the same was found dysfunctional Friday. The webpage on the Saral Haryana portal – Movement Pass for Covid-19 curfew/lockdown- saw glitches throughout the day as certain sections required to fill in the details were not working. While commuters said they faced difficulties in applying for fresh passes on Friday, officials said movement from Delhi to Gurugram was allowed only on the basis of passes issued by the district administration. The Sirhaul border, which was sealed on Friday morning, left many commuters stranded. The borders had been sealed on May 1 but the police stopped checking for passes last week. Haryana home minister Anil Vij, however, issued orders on Thursday to seal the border in the wake of a spike in Covid-19 cases in Gurugram, which has breached 400.Application for movement passes includes two categories – public movement pass and special weekly pass. The special weekly pass is applicable for special services such as doctors, nurses, paramedics, government employees and judiciary. On the other hand, public movement pass covers airport personnel, emergency scheduled surgeries, funeral (20 persons), geriatric issues, marriage function (50 persons), medical emergency, non-medical emergency, ongoing critical treatments, paediatric issues, pregnancy, private sector office, routine health checkups, scheduled flights and trains, veterinary issue, and visiting a family in other states.Muhammed Akil, Gurugram’s police commissioner, said the process of issuing new passes will start on Saturday. People carrying valid passes till May 31 are allowed to cross the border, according to Akil.When contacted, Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, said, “There was a server problem at the headquarter. The server was down for two hours.”The portal, however, till late Friday, remained dysfunctional as sections such as the ‘Pass Required Upto’ (date) was blocked. In addition, the list of districts did not reflect in the movement section, despite it being mandatory. Many commuters said they either could not fill in their details to apply afresh or the application page didn’t open at all.Ramesh Singh, who works for an IT company in Cyber City, said, “Till now, we were allowed to easily cross the border without showing any movement pass. Since there was a relaxation in crossing the border, we did not require any new passes. Now, without informing us or giving us time to arrange for new passes, we are asked to return from the border.” Singh decided to apply for a movement pass online after waiting at the border. He said he could not fill in the details as the section ‘Pass required upto’ was blocked. Kundan, an employee with an essential service company in Udyog Vihar, said, “We were already struggling with retaining our jobs. Unrestricted movement was at least an assurance that we can start working and get our salaries, which has already been deducted. But now it seems another challenge to apply for fresh passes and wait for its approval.” Like Singh, Kundan also was unable to access the portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-web-portal-for-movement-passes-faces-technical-issues-commuters-left-hassled/story-GkReKCUf4bAXtzlq0Lf7NJ.html
29-05-2020||City||Offices, industrial units witness thin attendance due to border sealing||Gurugram: With the state border with Delhi sealed, offices and industries in Gurugram saw thin attendance of workforce on Friday.The Haryana government had re-ordered the restrictions on movement on Thursday following a spurt in Covid-19 positive case in Gurugram. Only those with movement passes and essential services would be allowed to cross the border. Earlier this month, the state government had restricted movement for the first time during the lockdown that began on March 25 to contain the spread of the disease. Last week, Gurugram Police said they would relax checking at the border and remove barricades during rush hours to prevent traffic jams.On Friday, these jams were back. The sudden sealing came as a surprise to many who were forced to return as they did not have movement passes.“Around half of our employees, from different departments, come from Delhi. Due to the sudden decision to block entry, a majority of them could not come and work has suffered. Client visits that were scheduled were also cancelled,” said a senior real estate professional, who preferred anonymity.At two large commercial office buildings at Sohna Road and another at Hero Honda Chowk, the scene was similar.“We are allowing only a third of our staff to work from these offices, but today only 18 to 20 per cent staffers could attend. All safeguards prescribed by the administration such as sanitisation, disinfecting the premises and temperature checks are religiously being followed,” said Kamaljeet Singh, senior vice president, Bestech that owns the buildings.“Limited number of people were coming to work and they were mostly locals. However, those coming from Delhi are likely to face difficulty due to border sealing. Things would become clear in next few days,” said a spokesperson for Circle.Work, a co-working office space located at HUDA city centre.Gurugram-based people who work in Delhi too were hit.A senior DLF employee, who works at its office in Delhi said that he had to work from home due to curbs at the border. “My pass has expired and the Saral Haryana portal had no option on Friday to obtain a new one,” he said.In Udyog Vihar, which is the industrial and office space hub of the city, many factory owners and senior professional had to miss work. “I have a unit in Udyog Vihar and another in Bahadurgarh and at both places entry was restricted for staff and vendors. I had to return from Sirhaul border and if this continues for some more days we don’t know how industry will run,” said Anurag Shokeen, managing director of a large garment unit, who lives in Delhi.Ashok Kohli, president, chamber of industries, Udyog Vihar said that authorities must ease the restrictions on the borders else it would be difficult to run the factories and revive economy. “Many offices and factory units remained idle as staff could not reach Udyog Vihar,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/offices-industrial-units-witness-thin-attendance-due-to-border-sealing/story-0XRxlNpDhED9ml1QFiSxAK.html
29-05-2020||Gurugram||Hundreds turn up at Delhi-Gurugram borders, are stopped, turned back||Hundreds of daily wage workers were not allowed to cross the Sirhaul border on Friday morning, following which they tried to enter Delhi through the Dundahera border, from where too they were back. . The Haryana government on Thursday had issued orders to reseal the borders with Delhi in order to contain the spread of Covid-19.On Friday, barricades were placed at all border crossings into the national capital, restricting the movement of vehicles and pedestrians on both carriageways.Motorists, cyclists and pedestrians huddled together after they were all asked to stop as soon as they crossed the Rajokri border. Some commuters got into a tiff with the police personnel after being denied entry, while many others were spotted trying to reason with the policemen on duty, telling them that they had already suffered salary loss of two months and if the situation remained the same , they will not be unable to survive.A number of daily wage labourers said they were shocked to see heavy police deployment on the borders on Friday morning and that they were stopped 500 metres before the barricading that had been put in place to restrict entry into Gurugram and were asked to return. Bhushan Sharma, a daily wage labourer who works in Udyog Vihar, said that they had resumed work after two months and for the last one week had not been stopped at the border. But on Friday again, they were not allowed to enter. “Police are asking us for passes, but we don’t know how and where to apply. If we do not join work, how will we make our ends meet. It’s becoming very difficult to survive without any income,” he said.Karan Goel, the assistant commissioner of police (DLF), said, “We are checking with factories, which the labourers have mentioned, to see if they have permissions to operate. Industries that have permissions from the district administration to operate have been directed to make arrangements for the stay of their workers , who will not be allowed to move in and out of the city,” he said.Some workers on Friday tried to dodge the police barricades and cross the border walking. But they were stopped and turned back, following which they went to the Dundahera border to try and cross over, but were denied entry.According to the police,a crowd of at least 1,500 people — mostly daily wage earners working in Udyog Vihar — had gathered on foot and on bi- cycles near the border around 9.30 am, demanding entry into the city.Goel said since the border was sealed, having a movement pass was mandatory to commute through inter-state borders on a daily basis. After crossing the border with a movement pass, it is the responsibility of the employers to make arrangements for the stay of workers within the company or factories. The police commissioner of Gurugram, Muhammad Akil, said the challenge is to control unnecessary vehicular movement. “Our teams asked them to return, due to which they blocked the road and did not allow those behind to move or even reverse their vehicles, resulting in traffic congestion,” he said.Starting Friday, the police have been directed not to let any motorist cross the city border unless they have a movement pass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hundreds-turn-up-at-delhi-gurugram-borders-are-stopped-turned-back/story-uWaBdWKNbYJOdoji7YO7DO.html
29-05-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram’s test positivity rate doubles in one week||The district’s Covid-19 test positivity rate (TPR) has almost doubled in the past week, coinciding with 166 new positive cases detected between May 22 and May 28. Officials and experts said that this surge is not necessarily a cause for alarm. Rather, it is a result of efficient contact tracing of susceptible individuals, along with an increase in the number of tests conducted over the last week. Analysed daily, Gurugram’s TPR on May 28 was 23.7%, with 68 of 286 new samples testing positive, according to the government health bulletin. This is the highest that the district’s TPR has been since testing began on March 14. TPR is the ratio of positive cases to the total number of samples tested and must be analysed on a daily or a weekly basis to understand the quality of testing and surveillance in a region.Seen as a moving, weekly average, Gurugram’s TPR jumped from 4% between May 15 and May 21 to 7.7% between May 22 and May 28. During this time, the number of samples tested from the district also increased by 20%, shows health department data. From 1,711 samples tested between May 15 and May 21, Gurugram tested 2,147 samples between May 21 and May 28. According to Dr Rajesh Kumar, epidemiologist and former professor at the department of community medicine, PGIMS Chandigarh, “This means that contact tracing is working efficiently. And there has been a slight uptick in testing numbers as well, so you could say that the general surveillance system itself has improved.”However, Kumar also said that an increasing positivity rate, as seen in Gurugram, also indicates that transmission of the virus has not been slowed down due to previous containment measures. “The success of ongoing containment measures will be seen in the next two to three weeks. If successful, then we should see a dip in cases towards mid-June,” he added. Sudha Garg, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s (IDSP) district surveillance officer in Gurugram, did not respond to requests seeking comment for this story. However, a senior IDSP official based in Panckula, seeking anonymity, said, “The surge in cases is a function of our surveillance and testing strategy. Better surveillance has yielded more number of cases. There is no cause for alarm as Gurugram’s case fatality ratio is still very low. We are detecting cases early on, and are able to keep mortality in check. This is the hallmark of a good surveillance system.” Of the 405 COVID-19 cases detected in the district so far, only three have succumbed to the disease. This is less than 1%, whereas India’s case fatality ratio on May 29 stood at about 2.8%, the official pointed out. JS Punia, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram, did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. Additional chief secretary (health), Rajeev Arora, said, “The uptick in number of cases was expected seeing as lockdown restrictions, particularly on public mobility, have been eased. But our testing numbers and surveillance efforts remain robust.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-s-test-positivity-rate-doubles-in-one-week/story-o5lF16UvhtydlUPzQuMeTL.html
29-05-2020||City||MCG orders probe into alleged anomalies in issuing fire NOC to several buildings||Gurugram:Acting on the complaints about the discrepancies in issuing no objection certificates (NOCs) to several buildings in the city by the fire department, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has directed its vigilance wing to investigate the alleged irregularities.MCG officials on Friday said that they had been receiving complaints on their social media account of buildings across the city operating with fire NOCs despite having various discrepancies.On MCG’s Twitter account, since February, several residents have lodged complaints regarding improper fire NOC being given to a freight forwarding agency in DLF Phase 4, a mall in Sector 53, a school in Sector 12, private hospitals on Sheetla Mata Road, Jharsa Road, and Sector 17A, among others.Taking cognizance of the complaints, MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh directed the vigilance wing on Thursday to start an investigation into issuance of fire NOCs, the officials said.“We have been receiving complaints through social media regarding various violations in fire NOC. We have asked the fire department for files. We are also looking at the rules of the fire act closely to check if there were any violations on behalf of the fire department while issuing NOCs,” said Amardeep Jain, additional commissioner who heads MCG’s vigilance wing.In Gurugram, the fire department falls under the ambit of the MCG. IS Kashyap, assistant divisional fire safety officer, said that the fire department is yet to receive any communication from the civic body in this regard. “The MCG has not asked for any specific files regarding fire NOCs. If they do, we will comply with their direction right away,” said Kashyap.The action by the MCG comes less than six days after a blaze occurred at a hand sanitiser manufacturing company in Kherki Daula which took 30 hours to douse.The sanitiser manufacturing company was allegedly operating with a conditional fire NOC as the company was yet to procure a building plan certificate from the MCG. The fire department had given the company six months to get a building plan based on which the conditional NOC was issued.An MCG official privy to the matter said that a building plan is one of the key components for approving any residential or commercial establishment to start operations.“A building plan discloses the type of layout of the building such as its exit and entry points, the width of its corridor, among other such key issues, which are taken into account especially for rescue operations before giving final approval. Hence, the fire department giving conditional NOC without a building plan may have been negligent. Fortunately, the building where the fire occurred in Kherki Daula had the requisite entry and exit points or else it could have led to fatalities,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mcg-orders-probe-into-alleged-anomalies-in-issuing-fire-noc-to-several-buildings/story-49T1Bs3Y7AytA1YNgk4TCO.html
29-05-2020||Delhi||Many Gurugram motorists choose Faridabad border to enter Delhi even as snarls reported on roads to Gurugram, Ghaziabad||With the Delhi-Gurugram border re-sealed on Friday after a week of allowing vehicles to pass through, several residents of Gurugram chose the Delhi-Faridabad border as their entry point into the national Capital even as the roads leading to Gurugram and Ghaziabad witnessed slow traffic in the morning hours.While the restrictions at the Gurugram borders had been lifted on May 18 and were back in place Friday, there was no order to de-seal the Delhi-Faridabad border. However, drivers of vehicles had to have valid passes if they wished to cross both borders.KK Rao, Faridabad’s police commissioner, said that the situation at the Faridabad border remained the same. “We have not de-sealed the border. Only essential service providers such as paramedical and sanitation workers are allowed to cross if they are equipped with passes,” Rao said.However, two factors—a relatively limited checking process at the Faridabad border and unrestricted access to the Delhi-Faridabad skyway—allowed motorists easier access to Delhi compared to other checkpoints in Gurugram.On Friday, several motorists from Gurugram travelled up to 40 kilometres extra (one-way) just to be able to gain unrestricted entry into Delhi.“When I couldn’t make it to Delhi from the Gurugram border, I got to know from a friend that the situation was different at the Faridabad border, as there was lesser checking and the using the skyway did not require a pass. I drove all the way to Faridabad to enter Delhi as I cannot afford to miss work anymore,” Sanjeev Rana, who works for a private firm in Rajouri Garden, said.Rana had to drive an extra 40 kilometres to make it to Delhi, but said it was an uninterrupted journey. “I simply took the Delhi-Faridabad skyway,” Rana said.In the morning hours, the police went about checking people near NHPC Chowk, about 500 metres before the Delhi-Faridabad toll plaza. But after that, there was practically no checking for those entering Delhi.“Our priority is to stop people from entering Faridabad, not those leaving Faridabad,” a police officer deployed at a checkpost on the carriageway leading into Faridabad said.Gurugram motorists said that they were aware of there being stricter checking when they return after the day’s work. “I hope the Delhi-Faridabad skyway will remain unchecked in the evening, though,” BD Singh, who runs a mobile phone shop in Deoli, said.Singh, like some others, wasn’t able to obtain an online pass from the Faridabad administration. “I was able to reopen my shop for a week. Now, I can’t suddenly close it again when my employees are willing to come to work,” Singh saidOn the return journey, if Singh doesn’t choose the skyway, he’ll be asked to show his pass at the Delhi-Badarpur border checkpoint.“We are only letting in those with valid passes issued by the Faridabad administration,” the police officer at the checkpoint said.Yet, these policemen let several vehicles through unchecked in the afternoon. “The checking will get stricter in the evening when people begin returning from their offices,” the policeman said.The police commissioner, however, said that he was unaware of any such misuse of border routes by Gurugram motorists and that he had received no such complaints.The sealing of the borders between Gurugram and Ghaziabad, meanwhile, led to heavy traffic on the roads leading to the two cities.The traffic police said that vehicles crawled on NH-8 and the Singhu border leading to Gurugram and Sonepat respectively and on the road towards the Ghaziabad border near Ghazipur.Taj Hassan, the special commissioner of traffic police, said that there wasn’t much the Delhi Police could do about the situation since motorists being stopped at these borders were being turned away, leading to snarls.“There have been no jams on the roads entering Delhi. As for the ones leading to these two cities, we are doing all we can by alerting motorists on social media to avoid venturing towards those borders unless they have the necessary permissions,” Hassan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/many-gurugram-motorists-choose-faridabad-border-to-enter-delhi-even-as-snarls-reported-on-roads-to-gurugram-ghaziabad/story-yAKJkDqR8gt1RDTWQe3LDI.html
29-05-2020||City||UP govt to approach Supreme Court over hiked land compensation||A day after the Allahabad high court ordered that the government must not burden plot allottees with the amount incurred towards providing an enhanced compensation to farmers, the Uttar Pradesh government said it will file a plea before the Supreme Court challenging the high court order.The HC order said allottees, including individuals, universities, colleges and builders including ATS, 3Cs, Supertech need not pay a hiked land compensation to farmers. Builders, residential plot owners and others had gone to the high court as they did not want to pay an additional ₹4,000 crore against their plots allotted by the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida).In August, 2014, a state government committee headed by then cabinet minister Rajendra Chaudhary had recommended that farmers whose land was acquired by Yeida should get a 64.7% hiked land compensation benefits, similar to that given to farmers in Noida and Greater Noida. The Yeida had directed developers, individual allottees and others to pay the extra ₹4,000 crore towards enhanced land compensation. This meant each allottee had to pay an additional ₹470 per square metre to ₹1,330 per square metre for their land. The Yeida, had so far paid ₹2,600 crore to farmers.The Allahabad high court on Thursday said the state government or the development authorities cannot recover increased compensation to farmers (whose land was acquired) from the allottees without a prior agreement with the allottees in this regard. “Any rights, on the basis of a concluded or final contract or lease, which have been crystallised in favour of any party cannot be taken away by framing a policy on some later date. A policy so framed would be prospective in nature and cannot affect the contracts already finalised. Any such policy which is unilaterally framed disturbing the rights which have accrued to a party would clearly be violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution,” the petitioners had contended. “The UP government has decided to file a plea before the Supreme Court because we have paid ₹2,600 crore already to farmers as per the committees’ decision,” Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, Yeida, said.There are at least 21,000 residential plot allottees, who have gone on to build universities and housing projects on the land allotted. Some of them paid the hiked land compensation as well. Around 170 individual plot allottees had filed the petition before the high court seeking relief from the hiked land compensation. “Paying the hiked land compensation is not feasible because the real estate sector has been in a slump for past many years. Buyers are also reluctant to pay the hiked land compensation,” RK Arora, president (UP chapter) National Real Estate Development Council, who has a realty project in Yamuna Expressway, said.“We had bought the plots in 2009 and many are yet to get possession. The Yeida should not recover hiked land compensation from plot owners as it is yet to provide even basic facilities in areas such as sectors 18 and 20, where these plots are located. The recovery of hiked land compensation is arbitrary and unjust,” Alok Singh, a plot owner said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-govt-to-approach-supreme-court-over-hiked-land-compensation/story-iKfboo5k5BRKUv3MPcDFOK.html

Veterinary doctors conducted its post mortem following which the tigress was cremated. The tigress had injury marks which hinted that it likely died in infighting with another tiger or tigress,” Rahul (who goes by his first name ), director of Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) said.This is the first death of a tiger this year inside Corbett Tiger Reserve, he said. The viscera of the tigress will be sent for testing to the animal testing lab in Bareilly so that the exact cause of its death is known. The death of the cat is not an isolated incident in the Kumaon region, as in the last two years, multiple carcasses have been found. In the second week of April, the carcass of a five-year-old male tiger was found in Ramnagar Forest Division near Corbett Tiger Reserve. In December last year, the carcass of a tigress was found in Corbett Tiger Reserve’s Bijrani zone. In September last year, a tigress was killed in CTR’s Dhela zone. In May last year, the carcass of a male tiger was found in Corbett’s Bijrani zone. In the same month carcass of another tiger was found in Corbett landscape under a culvert in Ringoda stream. In February 2019, the carcass of a tigress was found in the forests of Terai Central forest division in Nainital, with officials saying the tigress died of old age or from some ailment. In January 2018, a tiger death was reported from Nainital district’s Ramnagar Forest Division. In April 2018, a tiger was killed in Surpudali range of Corbett Tiger Reserve. In May 2018, a tigress was found dead in the forests of Almora district.Corbett and its surroundings have one of the highest tiger densities in the world. The tiger population has increased in the Corbett landscape over the years, with last estimates pointing out that there are over 260 tigers within CTR at present, said forest officials. Ramnagar Forest Division around Corbett has over 14 tigers per 100 sq km, while Corbett has 9.4 tigers/100 sq km, according to experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/tigress-found-dead-in-corbett-tiger-reserve-first-tiger-death-in-corbett-this-year/story-nrP2yKPqYPRzekJo0kxIjN.html

29-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad gears up to deal with locust attack||The Ghaziabad district administration is gearing up to deal with a new problem — a possible locust attack that may swarm in through its borders.The district administration has so far set up a control room to deal with the situation and issued directions to the urban local bodies to make ready their jet spray equipment. The officials, however, said that people in urban areas have limited options and may resort to making loud noise to drive away the locusts.India is battling the worst desert locust invasion in more than 21 years. The crop-destroying swarms first attacked Rajasthan and have now spread to other states like Punjab, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and UP.“The locusts are presently in areas near Jhansi and the wind directions, which is at present unfavourable, to determine if or not they travel towards Ghaziabad. In urban areas, people can resort to making loud noise — like playing loudspeakers, switching on their cars or tractors or other vehicles,” said RS Verma, plant protection officer from the district agricultural department.According to officials, the district has a vast measure of about 52,000 hectares of agricultural fields, which needs to be protected. They added that Ghaziabad at the moment has standing sugarcane crop in about 35,000 hectares and much damage my take place in case of a locust attack.“The use of loud music or sound source in urban areas is needed as spraying of chemicals is not advisable in residential areas. The locust prefers staying at places that have vegetation and there are chances that they do not enter urban residential houses. They also get attacked by dogs, cats and even birds. They generally move along with the wind direction during the day time and stay on ground during evening and night,” he added.The district officials are already on alert mode and teams have been deployed to track the movement of the locust swarms.The officials said that an alert has already been sounded in rural areas, where teams at the panchayat levels have been briefed about measures to be taken and chemical spraying that needs to be undertaken in case of a locust attack.“The last known location of the locust is near Jhansi and the wind right now is not blowing towards Ghaziabad. But that will not be the case if the wind changes direction. During night stay they also lay eggs and prefer soft soil to stay. It is at this time when we need to destroy them,” said Dr Virendra Kumar, deputy director (agriculture).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-gears-up-to-deal-with-locust-attack/story-nj3YOVb0KKlL2fk3MzQnxK.html
29-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Half of Covid-19 patients between 21 and 40 years||A little over half of the persons affected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Ghaziabad so far are between 21 and 41 years of age, data maintained by the district health department shows. While out of the total 276 Covid-19 cases reported in the district until Thursday nearly 51.09% of the total patients belong to the age group of 21-40 years, those over 60 years of age constitute around 7.25% of the total cases making senior citizens the least affected group in the district.District health officials said that people in the age group of 21-40 years have been affected the most as they form the largest group of people moving out of their homes for various reasons amid the lockdown. According to official figures, until May 29 evening, at least 141 persons in the age group of 21-40 years were affected out of the total 276 cases in the district which also included four deaths. “The prime reason for so many people in the age group of 21-40 years getting affected by Covid-19 is because many people in this age group have been going out to their offices, making grocery runs and for other works during the lockdown. However, the infection affected people in all age groups, and also led to the death of four persons,” said Dr NK Gupta, district chief medical officer (CMO).As many as 38 persons (13.76%) of total people affected are in the age group of 0-20 years were affected, while 77 persons were in the age group of 41-60 years. At 7.25%, 20 persons above the age of 60 have been affected by the deadly infection. “Senior citizens have been taking a lot of precautions and mostly staying indoors. There has also been a lot of stress on protecting the elderly given their low immunity and their other health ailments. Most senior citizens have stayed indoors and hence, this age group has been least affected by a coronavirus in the district,” the CMO added.Meanwhile, persons in the age group of 0-20 years who contracted the infection include three minor children: a six-year-old girl and a two-year-old girl in the district were affected after coming in contact with Covid-19 positive family members, while the youngest patient to test positive was a three-day-old girl.“The rate of children getting affected is less and this trend is also prevalent in countries like China. There are a number of cases where pregnant women were infected, but most of the newborns did not acquire the infection from their mothers. So, it is primarily because of strong immunity that babies and children have not got affected to a large extent,” said Dr VB Jindal, president of the Ghaziabad chapter of the Indian Medical Association.“On the other hand, most senior citizens who tested positive for the infection caught it from other family members. As the age group of 21-40 years has the highest mobility rate, and coronavirus spreads easily among humans, this group has been affected the most. Even though the lockdown norms have relaxed, it is vital that all the prescribed prevention and preventive measures are strictly followed for a long time to come,” he added.Dr Jindal added that senior citizens with diabetes and those suffering from kidney and blood pressure related problems should take extra precautions and stay indoors as much as possible.Official data also shows that more men have been affected by Covid-19 in the district so far. Out of the total cases, 197 people affected by Covid-19 are men, while the percentage of women patients is 28.62 (79 cases)]SIXTEEN NEW CASESThe chief medical officer said 16 new cases Covid-19 cases were reported on Friday, taking the district tally from 260 to 276. The officials said one case each was reported from Maharajpur, Pratap Vihar, Hindon Vihar, Behrampur, and Shalimar Garden Extension 2 while two cases were reported from Jhandapur.They added that nine other cases were reported from sectors 3, 4, and 5 in Vaishali locality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-half-of-covid-19-patients-between-21-and-40-years/story-potkPD9LEoK3GuyfQ00f2M.html
29-05-2020||City||Ghaziabad halts for now operation of special trains and buses as migrants’ number shrinks||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad administration has decided to suspend the operations of Shramik special trains and buses, saying that the number of migrant workers who arrive in the city from Delhi and other NCR towns every day has now considerably reduced.Officials said that only about 400 to 500 migrant workers were left on Friday in different shelter homes in the city.Since early May, hundreds, at times thousands, of migrant workers had been reaching Ghaziabad’s Ghanta Ghar Ramlila Maidan to secure boarding passes for the special trains to their homes in Bihar and other districts of Uttar Pradesh amid the Covid-19 lockdown.“A total of 31 special trains have departed from Ghaziabad railway station. The last train departed on May 24. These trains went to different cities in Bihar and UP. The operation of such trains have been stopped for now due to the fact that very few migrant workers are now coming to Ghaziabad. We are planning for a train to West Bengal on Saturday,” said Santosh Kumar Vaishya, additional district magistrate (executive).According to official estimates, these trains and buses have so far ferried about 170,000 migrant workers to different cities in UP and Bihar.The officials said that on an average a special train carried about 1,200 to 1,300 passengers.The first train from Ghaziabad left for Bihar on May 15, they said.Apart from the 31 trains, the UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) also shared a major contribution in ferrying 131,627 migrant workers in 4,671 buses which left from different depots of Ghaziabad, Kaushambi, Loni, Sahibabad, Hapur, Sikandrabad and Bulandshahr, all falling under UPSRTC’s Ghaziabad region.The UPSRTC ran the buses for migrants from May 1 to May 28.“We operated the buses till May 28. Now the operations have been halted, as migrant workers have stopped coming. Only a few are left. Once the number of migrants for a particular route increases, we will despatch more buses. Nine of our buses dropped migrant workers to Uttarakhand border on May 28, while one bus also left for Bihar,” said AK Singh, regional manager of UPSRTC.“Besides, one of our buses ferried a group of 12 students from Manipur. A bus with the students on board also started from Manipur and both buses met midway near Purulia, West Bengal, and exchanged students. Then both buses went back to their origination point,” he added.Meanwhile, on Friday, some migrant workers reached Morta in Ghaziabad and found no buses or trains to their home towns.“I came here on foot and found no mode of transport in operation on Friday. My relatives left for my home town from Delhi about a fortnight ago. I waited for work to start and hoped I will get some money. But my employer refused to lend me money. Finally, I reached Morta on Friday morning in hope that I will get some train or a bus to reach my home town,” said Tilak Ram, a migrant worker from Faizabad in UP, who was part of the cleaning staff at a restaurant in Delhi’s Rajouri Garden.“The officials told me that there is no bus at the moment, but they will arrange it in a day or two,” he said.Meanwhile, state officials said that all the migrants who wish to return to UP will be brought through trains and buses, and will be sent to their home towns for free. “The CM has asked the chief secretary to get in touch with chief secretaries of different states to provide a list of migrant workers who are still left and can be brought back home,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).According to official figures, about 2.35 million people have come to UP through trains and buses while about 450,000 have come to UP border areas through their own means.The officials said that about 1,531 trains have already arrived in UP from different states and the tally will touch 1,557 trains in a day or two.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-halts-for-now-operation-of-special-trains-and-buses-as-migrants-number-shrinks/story-hcZO2UAIyg7V7tUCx6VqqL.html

29-05-2020||City||Navi Mumbai stops registrations for Shramik trains||The Navi Mumbai police on Friday announced that they would stop accepting applications for Shramik special as most labourers have returned to their hometown. Currently, 5,188 labourers are on the list and they will be provided an alternative transport.The decision to stop accepting new applications was due to several reasons, including no consent from some states and a lower turnout among other reasons.Railway Board chairman VK Yadav, during a press conference on Friday, said the demand for the special trains have reduced in the past two days across the country. “Yesterday (Thursday), 137 trains were operated while 172 trains operated the day before. Last week, the average was of 250 trains a day,” Yadav added.Earlier this week, a group of 200 people travelling in a bus from Navi Mumbai was forced to return after Karnataka did not allow entry. The group had an approved pass from Navi Mumbai but Karnataka government did not allow them in.Navi Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Kumar said, “We have sent most of the people home. Yesterday, two trains, including one for Uttar Pradesh departed. For small clusters of people going to different districts, we are in contact with other districts if trains are headed in their direction so they can be accommodated.”Kumar added that since the regular outstation trains are starting in a phased manner, those who can afford to incur the expenses can opt to purchase the tickets.Until now, close to 50 such special trains have departed from Navi Mumbai and Panvel transporting 63,209 labourers to different states, mainly from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand and West Bengal.No migrant has been sent from Navi Mumbai to Goa, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Chandigarh and Andaman and Nicobar Islands due to lower number of people on the list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navi-mumbai-stops-registrations-for-shramik-trains/story-ps7OXYyjFV7bcXu39jRuKM.html
29-05-2020||City||80% hike in MBBS fee: Medical education in Punjab is already costliest in region||The Punjab cabinet’s decision to hike the fee for MBBS course by 80% has added additional burden on medical aspirants, who are already being made to pay much more than their counterparts studying in government institutes in neighbouring states.With the course fee set to go up from Rs 4.4 lakh to Rs 7.8 lakh after the May 27 decision, the medical fraternity has condemned the move, even as medical education minister OP Soni justified it, stating, “The government spends around Rs 35 lakh to make a doctor. Therefore Rs 7.8 lakh is not a big amount for the entire course.”According to fee slips of various government medical colleges this year, MBBS students have paid an annual fee of around Rs 23,000 in Chandigarh, Rs 52,000 in Haryana , Rs 60,000 in Himachal Pradesh and Rs 1 lakh in Punjab, the already existing disparity being 66% to 300%.CABINET MOVE CONDEMNEDAccusing the Punjab government of apathy, Indian Medical Association, Punjab, president Dr Navjot Singh Dahiya said the fee hike of such a magnitude will cause scarcity of medical professionals, and make both medical education as well as access to healthcare services out of reach of the common man. “While the whole world is passing through the Covid-19 pandemic and there is an emergent need to promote medical education and research, the exorbitant hike in fee for medical students would hinder parents to get their wards to go for the expensive medical courses,” he said, in a joint statement along with Dr Paramjit Mann, general secretary, IMA, Punjab, while demanding an immediate rollback of the hike. The state government’s decision, in fact, comes at a time when there is a demand for complete waiver of fee for junior resident doctors and hike in their stipend. Dr Nitin Chabra, president, Resident Doctors Association, Government Medical College, Patiala, said: “MBBS students in Punjab are already paying much more than those in neighbouring states and Chandigarh. We will not accept the 80% fee hike and will fight the decision. We demand the state government immediately withdrawn it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/80-hike-in-mbbs-fee-medical-education-in-punjab-is-already-costliest-in-region/story-BaGXr9Cjoe7n2CGXSyn9LK.html
29-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt for opening neighbourhood religious places, shops in malls on odd-even basis post May 31: Reports||Allowing opening of neighbourhood religious places, shops in malls on odd-even basis and extension of market timings after May 31 are among the recommendations the Delhi government is likely to make to the Centre, sources said.However, the Delhi government is not in favour of allowing cinema halls, schools and colleges to open after May 31, when the fourth phase of the nationwide lockdown would end.The nationwide curbs was first announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 for 21 days in a bid to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. It was first extended till May 3 and then again till May 17. The lockdown was further extended for the third time till May 31.Sources said famous religious places in Delhi where people gather in large numbers will remain closed. These may include Jama Masjid, Akshardham Temple and Gurudwara Bangla Sahib.They also said the government is contemplating to allow only 10 people at a neighbourhood religious place at a time to ensure social-distancing.Sources said the Delhi government is likely to send its recommendations to the Centre by Saturday.

The freedom from the fear of leakage or unpleasant odour increase their ability to be at school or at the workplace during menstruation.Women cannot predict when menstruation will start, therefore there should be easy availability and supply of sanitary pads and clothes at family level as well as schools and workplaces, it states further.It added that for hygienic and proper menstruation management a system is evolved which consists of easy access to hygienic absorbents, availability of the facility for cleaning and disposal of used absorbents or waste with privacy and dignity.The petitioners have asserted that sanitary napkins are essential requirement of every woman and women have the right to get them at a cheaper rate as on an average, every woman spends about 3,000 days of her life menstruating and lack of cleanliness during this period may lead to infections.Therefore, they have also sought proper implementation of the national guidelines for menstrual hygiene management issued in 2015 by Union ministry of drinking water and sanitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pil-seeks-sanitary-napkins-to-be-declared-essential-commodity-hc-asks-centre-to-respond/story-RHlKNSE7WlCnU6FyMCkg1N.html

29-05-2020||City||HP govt must issue white paper on purchases made by health department, says Congress||The Congress on Friday demanded the Himachal Pradesh government should issue a white paper regarding all the purchases made by the state’s health department and a judicial inquiry into an alleged corruption case against former director health services. In a statement issued by the leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri said that even when the whole world is battling coronavirus pandemic, scams in the health department during such sensitive times is a definition of treason. Therefore, it is necessary to take extensive steps in order to maintain trust in the government machinery.He said that the state government should reveal that how many purchases were made without tendering since the lockdown was imposed and how many tenders were received and rejected and for whose benefit direct purchases were made instead of finalising tenders.“Resignation of state BJP president is not a small incident as it is linked with the health scam. Therefore, all the events from the beginning till now including letter bomb should be brought under scrutiny,” said Agnihotri.State BJP president Rajeev Bindal had resigned from his post on Wednesday within four-and-a-half months of his appointment, saying he was doing so to ensure a proper investigation into the case of alleged corruption by the health department official. In a resignation letter sent to BJP president J P Nadda, Bindal said he was tendering his resignation on high moral grounds as some people were dragging the party’s name in the alleged corruption case. The state government has not even clarified abrupt removal of principal of Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla. Earlier irregularities in purchases in the state’s Ayurveda department were also revealed, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hp-govt-must-issue-white-paper-on-purchases-made-by-health-department-says-congress/story-O2IEZcV1reKOHy2ZrjXRTI.html

29-05-2020||City||Climate meet COP26 to be held next November||The 26th conference of parties, or COP26, of the United Nations scheduled to be held in Glasgow later this year has now been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic to November 2021 following consultations with stakeholders, officials said on Friday.Alok Sharma, business secretary in the Boris Johnson government and the COP26 president, said: “While we rightly focus on fighting the immediate crisis of the coronavirus, we must not lose sight of the huge challenges of climate change”.“With the new dates for COP26 now agreed, we are working with our international partners on an ambitious road map for global climate action between now and November 2021. The steps we take to rebuild our economies will have a profound impact on our societies’ future sustainability, resilience and well-being and COP26 can be a moment where the world unites behind a clean resilient recovery”.The decision on the new date comes as the UK government announced that over 25 experts in multiple global sectors will be advising the COP26 Presidency. The Friends of COP bring expertise from countries across six continents, including France, Barbados, Chad, Australia, India and Peru.As the host of COP26 in November 2021, the officials said, the UK will continue to work with all involved to increase climate action, build resilience and lower emissions. The new date will also allow the UK and Italian partners to harness incoming G7 and G20 presidencies in driving climate ambition.UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa said: “Our efforts to address climate change and Covid-19 are not mutually exclusive. If done right, the recovery from the Covid-19 crisis can steer us to a more inclusive and sustainable climate path”.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that groups of up to six people will be able to meet outdoors in England from next Monday, provided strict social distancing guidelines are followed, as part of steps towards easing the country’s coronavirus lockdown.The devolved administration of Scotland has begun easing its lockdown from Friday, allowing people from two households to meet outside so long as they keep at least two metres of distance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/climate-meet-cop26-to-be-held-next-november/story-H7b6b3ef4YRXzdGgcnii1L.html
29-05-2020||Mumbai||250 tribals protest for ration cards in Palghar, booked||More than 250 tribals were booked by the Palghar police on Thursday for staging a sit-in protest in front of the tehsil offices, demanding ration cards as they were denied foodgrains by the state government. The agitation entered its third day on Friday, though no arrest was made so far.The government had stated that tribals who do not have ration cards will be issued the same after they apply before the tehsil offices, said Vivek Pandit, ex-MLA and president, Shramjeevi Sanghatana, a tribal welfare outfit which is organising the stir. So far, around 19,000 applications are lying pending before the tehsil offices in Palghar, Raigad, Nashik and Thane districts since the past few weeks and till now only a small fraction of the applicants were issued new ration cards, said Pandit. No reason is being given for the delay in the new ration cards issuance, said Pandit. The protestors are also demanding work under the employment guarantee scheme (EGS), said Pandit.The tribals wore face masks and maintained social distance and a group of 50 protestors sat opposite the tehsil offices in batches, said Pandit. Without a ration card, the tribal cannot get rice, wheat, pulses, edible oil and other essential commodities, but the government is delaying in issuing the cards, he said.Pandit had petitioned before the HC recently, where the court ordered the state government to issue ration cards to those tribals who do not possess such and with which essential commodities could be procured. Now it seems that the issuance of the ration cards will be a distant dream for the tribals he added.The group alleged that the police were registering the offences in the night and not during day time when the agitation takes place and this itself reflects their intention.A spokesperson of the Palghar police have confirmed that around 250 tribals have been booked under sections 188 (disobedience), 269 (spread of infection) of the IPC and relevant sections of the Epidemic Act and National Disaster Management Act, 2005, though no arrest was made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/250-tribals-protest-for-ration-cards-in-palghar-booked/story-YtPLrhCsxRo5kXK4t525SK.html
29-05-2020||City||Bear attacking orchards increases worries of orchardists, farmers||Bear attacking apple and cherry orchards and farms in several parts of the Shimla district is giving sleepless nights to orchardists and farmers of the region. Farmers who are already affected by the lockdown and recent heavy rainfall and hailstorm, are now worried and scared due to bears entering their farms, destroying crops and injuring people.Kotgarh divisional forest officer Arvind Kumar said that though the department conducts training camps to help villagers, they have not been able to conduct training camps this year. In camps, people are taught about domestic methods like using chilly smoke, always remaining in groups, shouting if confronted by a bear amongst others to save themselves and their farms from bears.He said that traps, cameras and cages to catch bears have been installed in many places.Rohit Shyam, an orchardist from Kotgarh said that fear of bear also affects their work in farms and orchards. “Every year during this period, bears destroy crops and even attack people. We have also spoken to the forest department regarding this. Recently, a bear destroyed the crops of a farmer in Sainj of Shimla district.”Shimla district is a major producer of apples and stone fruits especially cherries.Bear attacks Nepalese man in Shimla districtA Nepalese man was attacked and injured by a bear in Punan village, Nankhari of Shimla district.The person identified as Khem Bahadur had gone to nearby jungle to feed his goats with another man and was suddenly attacked and dragged by a bear. His friend started to make noise and the bear ran away.The injured was taken to Civil Hospital, Nankhari from where he received 13 stitches on his head. He was later referred to Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla for treatment.The incident has scared local residents and they have demanded the forest department to catch the bear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bear-attacking-orchards-increases-worries-of-orchardists-farmers/story-QRVCSZSaqWNV7ZIaEVwP3O.html
29-05-2020||City||Chandigarh’s Covid-19 positivity rate higher than that of neighbouring states||Chandigarh: Out of every 100 persons tested for Covid-19 in Chandigarh in the last few months, six were found positive, a number way higher than the national average of four positive cases out of 100 persons tested, data analysed by Hindustan Times reveals.The neighbouring states too seem to have fared better than Chandigarh with less than three out of every 100 tests confirming positive in Punjab and one each in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.After the first Covid-19 cases were reported and till May 28, Punjab tested 78,014 persons, of which 2,158 tested positive ( 2.7% positivity rate); and Haryana conducted 1,08,031 tests with 1,504 testing positive (1.3% positivity rate). Of the 32,449 tests Himachal Pradesh conducted, 281 tested positive, accounting for 0.88% positivity rate. ‘High-risk population means higher positivity rates’Meanwhile Chandigarh conducted 4,467 tests till May, out of which 288 were positive, which translated to a positivity rate of 6.4%. Similarly, in April, with 843 people tested and 56 persons infected, the positivity rate was 6.6% . However, May 11 had a major spike when 181 out of 2,177 tested positive (8.3%), after which the numbers decreased, suggesting that a high risk population could have been tested, including contacts of positive persons.On the high positivity rates, Dr Sonu Goel, community health expert at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) , said the numbers depended on how many people were tested and from where. “If screened from a high risk population and very less from low risk, then it is bound to be high,” he added.Positivity rate touched 10% to 12% in Covid-19 hotspot“In the most affected part of the city, Bapu Dham colony, the test positivity rate touches around 10% to 12%. This means a high risk group is being tested, which leads to overall hike in the test positivity rate. In Haryana and other states testing might not be concentrated in specific groups. It may also suggest how much the virus has spread in the specific community or area as well,” said a senior epidemiologist at PGIMER who did not wish to be named. The Chandigarh health department, which earlier had drawn flak for low testing numbers has attributed the high positivity rate to a focused testing policy according to Central government guidelines.“Ideally, no category of persons should be excluded from testing and no one should be included in the testing protocol framed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). However, some states are doing testing for domestic airline arrivals as well as asymptomatic persons, which is not advised by ICMR so far,” UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said. Similarly testing has been extended to other categories of people (in other states). “So, if any state extends the protocol beyond Central government guidelines, the positivity or confirmation rate is likely to be low,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-s-covid-19-positivity-rate-higher-than-that-of-neighbouring-states/story-hZigK8tqqIX08TRwLRAAoI.html

Villagers don’t even have drinking water. Donate whatever you can. We will accept even one rupee from you. But please don’t donate your discarded clothes. You can even donate books, food and tarpaulin,” Banerjee said with folded hands at a press conference at the state secretariat.The centre had earlier announced a relief package of Rs 1,000 crore for Bengal after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an aerial survey of the two worst hit districts on May 23. The state too had earlier announced a package of Rs 1,000 crore. The package announced by Banerjee on Friday was over and above these.More than half a million villagers who have lost their huts and more than two million farmers will be provided grants and assistance from the Rs 6,250 crore package. Rs 250 crore will be used to install tube wells, Rs 200 crore to repair embankments, Rs 200 crore to rebuild roads, Rs 100 crore for those who have lost cattle and poultry and Rs 100 crore for repairing school buildings among others.“I don’t know whether any other state worked with such lightning speed after any disaster to provide relief. Out of the Rs 6,250 crore, nearly 5000 crore have already been released. Money was directly transferred to the bank account of one lakh villagers on Friday,” Banerjee said.She also urged samaritans to donate to the state government’s fund and not to provide relief to the villagers directly.“We know, who have received relief and who are still in need of it. You may miss out if you go there directly. Please donate to us. We will distribute it equally without discrimination,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/cyclone-amphan-death-toll-mounts-to-98-bengal-govt-announces-rs-6-250-crore-package/story-KI2Eg8X86aAHR7hqAU9USK.html

He also appreciated the efforts of the board for providing an opportunity to students who failed in March, 2019, and re-appeared in the examinations held in June 2019 along with State Open School candidates.The CM also felt the need to promote moral education, vedic maths and vocational education in school curriculum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/efforts-required-to-popularise-sanskrit-among-people-himachal-cm/story-NgKhb7I1LXmGnbuOej1IKL.html

The administration had made Covid-19 testing mandatory for those returning to the Union territory which has helped combat the spread of the infection, the official said.Principal secretary, information, and government spokesperson Rohit Kansal said that the J&K administration has been able to combat the pandemic in better ways than some of the bigger and resourceful states.“In order to control the spread of the disease, the administration had intensified testing and despite constraints, it provided better facilities in the shortest possible time,” he said.The principal secretary added that the administration got its labs accredited, roped in other hospitals, entered into an agreement with ICMR accredited private labs and also went ahead with pool testing to maximise its capacity.“We also accorded attention to robust contact tracing and aggressive testing that included red zones and containment areas,” he said.“When the stranded residents started returning in the UT, we made Covid-19 testing mandatory for all. It helped us detect and isolate positive patients. Given that most of them were asymptomatic, had they not been tested they would have continued undetected and potentially infected a large number of people,” said Kansal.The UT has been conducting 7,000 to 8,000 tests per day in eight labs, probably highest in the country.These labs are located in SKIMS, GMC Srinagar and Jammu, Command Hospital Udhampur, IIIM lab in Jammu, SKIMSJV college in Bemina, and two ICMR approved private labs.Till Thursday, a total of 2,036 positive cases were reported. Of this 859 have been cured and 1150 are active cases. The UT has reported 27 Covid-19 deaths so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/of-1-lakh-returnees-in-j-k-nearly-800-test-positive-for-covid-19-since-may-1/story-oBN35ChreDL9GKi9O0bxlK.html
29-05-2020||City||Spike in pass percentages for class 9, 11 of Delhi govt schools after revised promotion policy||New Delhi: In the class 9 results of the 2019-2020 academic year declared Tuesday as per revised promotion policies, government schools in Delhi saw the highest pass percentage in at least five years, data accessed by Hindustan Times has revealed. In class 11, meanwhile, the pass percentage improved from last year’s 84.8% to 96.2% this year.These figures are significant in light of the fact that the promotion of these students of these classes was based on a revised policy on the subject, outlined by the Directorate of Education as a one-time measure necessitated by the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease crisis as well as the riots which took place in northeast Delhi in February.Under this formula, the students of these classes who appeared for the exams were allotted grace marks to reach 33%, the passing bar, in the five main subjects. Earlier, a minimum of 25% marks was mandatory in the 60-marks’ annual exam. The revised policy also stated that students who could not appear for their final exams due to the riots or the Covid-19 crisis be given marks proportional to their mid-term results.Going by the data, at least 64.5% of the 2,79,377 students of Delhi government schools who had appeared for class 9 exams for the 2019-20 academic year have been promoted to Class 10. The total number of students who appeared in class 9 exams this year was 4.4% more than last year, the data reveals.For class 11, the pass percentage is higher. Out of the 1,65,650 students of Delhi government schools who had appeared for the exams this year, around 96%, or 1,59,283 students, have been promoted. Last year, the pass percentage for class 11 was at 84.8%. The total number of students who appeared for the class 11 exams this year was 24% more than last year, the data reveals.“Marks are compiled on the basis of exams that were already conducted before the lockdown or the northeast Delhi disturbance. Apart from giving weightage for midterm and internal assessments, a maximum grace of 15 marks is given in one or more subjects together, keeping in view the special circumstances in which the students had to take exam this year,” a senior government official said, asking not to be named.The students who could not be promoted under this revised promotion policy, however, will be given a chance to reappear in one or any number of subjects in which they could not clear the exam. “That re-examination is likely to be conducted in July 2020, for which the DOE will issue a date sheet soon,” the official cited above added.Principals across government schools in the Capital, meanwhile, also acknowledged the jump in pass percentage of these classes. Awadhesh Kr Jha, principal of a government school in Rohini’s Sector 8, said, “We’ve had student-friendly results this time and there has been a marked improvement in results from previous years. Students were also given grace marks keeping the stress of the pandemic in mind. In our school, the pass percentage for class 9 is around 10% better than last year. For class 11, it is even better as only eight students got compartment results. Earlier, this figure used to be 20-30 students.”However, concerns over how students will perform in board exams next year remains. “We are concerned about how students will perform since they cannot come to school for regular classes. We are hoping to make up for the lost time once the Covid-19 pandemic situation is better so as to maintain the quality of the board results,” Jha said.The school also plans to write to the education department to recommend classroom teaching for board students in July while maintaining staggered timings and social distancing measures, he said.“A reduction in the syllabus is actively being considered. So it is likely that the same syllabus won’t have to be covered in a reduced timeframe,” a senior education department official, requesting anonymity, said over the matter.Earlier in April, Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia had written to the Union minister of human resource development to reduce the curriculum by 30%.Delhi government schools have been criticised for their poor pass percentages for class 9 in the past, owing to a number of reasons including low-learning levels in primary classes, lack of regular teachers, and the no-detention policy which did not allow schools to fail students until class 8. While the government has introduced certain learning interventions such as the Mission Buniyaad and Chunauti scheme to rectify this, critics say it has done little to improve pass percentage in higher classes.According to the 2019 Praja Foundation report around 55% of class 9 students of the 2016-17 academic year did not pass their annual exams. The corresponding number for class 12 was relatively lower at 24%, but still a drop of over 36,000 students.Addressing these concerns, a senior government official, on condition of anonymity, said, “Focus has to be on improving learning levels during primary classes. Class 6 onwards, the lessons get difficult for the child if they don’t have basic foundational learning. This is what Mission Buniyaad is working on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/spike-in-pass-percentages-for-class-9-11-of-delhi-govt-schools-after-revised-promotion-policy/story-z63D7qM9ZOwumIoFJ9c1NK.html
29-05-2020||City||Gangster Arun Gawli’s parole extended by five days||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) extended the parole of gangster Arun Gawli by five days on Friday. Gawli is serving a life sentence at Nagpur jail for the murder of Shiv Sena corporator Kamlakar Jamsandekar. He now has to surrender before the Nagpur central prison on June 2. Gawli, who is on parole from February 26 for his daughter Yogita’s wedding, was directed by the bench to surrender at the Taloja Jail in Navi Mumbai after refusing to extend his parole last week.In a petition before the court on Friday, Gawli’s counsel said that as per the court directives, he went to Taloja prison on May 24 to surrender, however, the jail superintendent refused his entry. The gangster then approached the divisional commissioner, Nagpur, through an application, citing the development. Gawli then moved a fresh plea to the bench, seeking a parole extension. On hearing both the sides, a division bench of justices SB Shukre and Anil Kilor granted a five-day extension. The court further directed him to apply for travel permission to the competent authority within the next 24 hours and thereafter he has to surrender within before the Nagpur central prison on June 2. The gangster was originally supposed to surrender on April 27, but following the national lockdown, his parole was extended on April 23 for seven days. On April 30, the parole was again extended by another week. Finally, the HC on May 17, directed Gawli to appear before the jail authorities within a period of seven days. Gawli again moved the HC for an extension till May 31 and grant him a further period of seven days to travel to Nagpur from Mumbai for surrendering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gangster-arun-gawli-s-parole-extended-by-five-days/story-KOr18OYPOQZ1uHjxjaPBYK.html
29-05-2020||Chandigarh||Two months on, once brimming eateries along the NH-44 on verge of closure||Before the coronavirus-induced lockdown, eateries lining the NH-44 used to be brimming with customers but two months of lockdown have left these popular joints on the verge of closure. The Karnal Haveli, Zhilmil, Mannat, Neelkanth, Divine Star, Dana Pani, The Vivan, Mayur and Fauji Dhaba are just some of the outlets famous for their lip-smacking fares. Commuters would make it a point to stop at these eateries.The hospitality industry is perhaps one of the worst-hit industries amid the pandemic. Owners say the two-and-a-half month closure has wrecked irreparable damage and that there was little hope of revival.PROSPECTS LOOK BLEAK, SAY DHABA OWNERSMannat Star Dhaba manager Pradeep Rawat says, “We had to send back around 110 employees as there was no possibility of revival over the next six months.”Though the government has allowed home delivery of edibles, owners of these eateries are reluctant to resume services. They say restaurants and dhabas cannot survive on home delivery of orders, which contribute a meager 5% of their earnings.Zhilmil Karnal Dhaba manager Surinder Mittal says, “There have been no sales since March 22. We have lost around Rs 1.25 lakh a day during the lockdown.”Mittal says the dhaba had to reduce its staff strength from 55 to 10 members to keep the eatery afloat.“The dhaba is costing us around Rs 5,000 a day these days, apart from the electricity bill and other fixed expenses,” he said. CMs ASSURANCES FAIL TO RESUSCITATE HOPE The issue was raised before chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar during his recent visit to Karnal. Though, the CM hinted that more relaxations might be given (as per MHA orders) from June 1, dhaba owners were not placated.“The number of cases are increasing day by day, even if the government allows us to start our kitchens, do you think people will put their life at stake to eat in dhabas?” asked Amit Kumar, owner of Golden Hut Dhaba in Kurukshetra.HUNDREDS LEFT JOBLESSThe eateries provided employment to hundreds of people, including waiters, cooks, security guards, sweepers and managers, all of whom have been rendered unemployed.A 25-year-old former cook at one of the reputed Dhabas in Karnal, pleading anonymity, said, “Soon after the lockdown, we were told to go home without any salary. My employer said they will call me back once the lockdown period is over. Now, I work as labourer in fields to feed my family.”Haryana Hotel and Restaurant Association president and owner of Karnal’s Noormahal and Jewels Hotels Colonel (retd) Manbeer Chaudhary said, “The businesses of thousands of restaurants, hotels and dhabas in the state have collapsed around our ears. The situation is so bleak that many people are planning to sell their properties.”‘NO HELPING HAND EXTENDED’Chaudhary alleged that neither the Centre nor the state had announced any relief for the battered industry. “Though a 25% waiver on fixed electricity charges was announced, it was not implemented.”“We have raised the matter before the CM repeatedly, but have not been offered any respite. The only silver lining is that the RBI has deferred payment of EMIs,” he said. The industry has demanded relaxation in GST, property tax and electricity bills for at least one year. Those in the hospitality industry have also demanded that they be allowed to serve food in eateries keeping social distancing measures in mind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-months-on-once-brimming-eateries-along-the-nh-44-on-verge-of-closure/story-RP9wLEH4BQrnbDnQ9puh7H.html

From May 23 onwards, positive cases started soaring with people increasingly returning to the state under the evacuation process started by the state government. On Thursday, with 31 Covid-19 positive cases, Uttarakhand had reached 500 mark.According to the health bulletin released by the state health department on Friday afternoon, of the fresh 216 positive cases, the maximum cases have been reported from Dehradun district (72), followed by Almora (21), Bageshwar (8), Tehri (8), Haridwar (5), US Nagar (5), Pauri (5), Uttarkashi (4), Rudraprayag (2) and Pithoragarh (1).So far Nainital district has now the overall highest positive cases (224) followed by 164 in Dehradun, 70 in Tehri Garhwal, 62 in US Nagar, 48 in Haridwar, 45 in Almora, 28 in Pauri, 21 in Pithoragarh, 16 in Bageshwar, 11 in Chamoli, 14 in Uttar Kashi, 8 in Champawat and 5 in Rudraprayag. Overall 102 people have recovered in the state so far, including 13 on Friday. The increasing number of cases has become a matter of concern for the health department in the state now. Given the sharp rise in cases, all chief medical officers in the state have been directed to ensure the installation of adequate number of ICU beds, ventilators, procurement of medicines and oxygen supply to tackle any extreme possible situation.Authorities in Uttarakhand are worried over spike in cases with the return of the migrants. According to government officials, over 2.59 lakh registrations for return to Uttarakhand had been made on the state website. Of these, the state government under its evacuation process has so far brought back over 1.78 lakh people through trains and buses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/in-biggest-single-day-jump-uttarakhand-reports-102-covid-19-positive-cases/story-VkkqdFmWluVMVBv13R7OjP.html

CPI (M) leader Sanjay Chauhan said due to recent heavy rainfall and hailstorm, fruit crops especially apples and vegetables like peas, tomatoes, cauliflowers etc were damaged in Rohru, Jubbal, Kotgarh, Kotkhai, Theog, Chopal, Rampur, Kumarsain, Nankhari, and Tikkar in Shimla district, Ani and Nirmand in Kullu district, Karsog and Seraj in Mandi district and in some parts of Kinnaur district. “However, the state government has not provided any financial package or relief to farmers and orchardists,” he said, adding that the financial worries of growers have increased due to both Covid-19 and adverse weather conditions. “Even at a time of this crisis, the state government is not providing manure, seeds, pesticides and fungicides to growers. They have no choice but to buy expensive agricultural and horticultural material from the market,” he said.The CPI (M) also asked the state government to waive off loans of farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/compensate-hp-farmers-for-loss-due-to-rain-hailstorm-cpi-m/story-Ddt6bxFaShum0qk8iF2V7H.html

Traders, mostly from Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur districts of the state adjoining China, start registering themselves in May.“Not a single trader has come forward to get registered so far,” Kinnaur deputy commissioner Gopal Chand said on Friday.The Indo-China Trade Association has requested the industries department, which facilitates the trade through Shipki La, to defer the cross-border business. “We have requested the government to postpone the trade between the two countries till Covid-19 subsides and things become normal,” the president of the Indo-China Trade Association said.TRADITIONAL TRADEThe traditional trade between India and China has seen many ups and downs. Bilateral trade through Shipki La reopened in 1993 after it was shut due to the Indo-China war in 1962. Shipki La is a mountain pass that connects Kinnaur district to the Tibetan Autonomous Region in China. It’s a border post at 18,599 feet. It is through this pass that the turbulent Sutlej enters India from China-occupied Tibet.Till 1959 when Chinese troops entered Tibet, trade was carried out under the barter system. Indian and Tibetan traders frequented Shipki village in Chinese Tibetan Autonomous Region and Namgia village on the Indian side. But after China occupied Tibet in 1959, no trader from Tibet visited India for varied reasons.At present, 37 trade items are exported from India that include agricultural implements, copper products, clothes, cycles, coffee, tea, barley, rice, flour, dry fruits, vegetables, edible oil, tobacco, snuff, spices, shoes , kerosene, stationary, utensils, liquor, milk-processed products, canned food, cigarettes, herbs, palm oil hardware, flowers, readymade garments, handloom products, and carpets.Due to the countrywide lockdown to combat the coronavirus crisis, traders this time were unable to stock on items to export as they buy them from markets in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi.TRADE SUFFERS SETBACKNearly 20 items are imported from China, including wool, raw silk, yak hair, China clay, borax, butter, common salt, horse, goat, sheep, readymade garments, shoes, quilts, blankets, carpets, and local herbal medicines.Trade suffered a setback when the Indian government banned the import and export of livestock that was a major component of trade in 2012 due to lack of quarantine facility for animals.Livestock comprised a major portion of cross-border trade. Traders imported chigu goats reared for wool and meat in China-controlled Tibet, while Chamurthi horses, known for their sturdiness, were popular among Indian traders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-trade-with-china-through-shipki-la-this-year/story-lSJRuWMlciZ97uvMiVkZPJ.html

However, some others are confused as to what protocol should be followed for allowing such residents into housing societies.The Pune police have further warned the RWAs stating that residential societies and gated communities who stop outstation residents from returning to their homes and demand a NOC will face action.According to the police, some residential societies have demanded that the returning residents get a NOC from the police in order to gain entry into the housing society. The society office bearers have been alert regarding Covid-19 infection rising in the city, and have been insisting for medical certificate and police NOC for entry.Bachchan Singh, deputy commissioner of police (Crime), Pune city said, “After the lockdown relaxations a lot of people have been travelling to Pune. We have come across some instances where societies or gated communities are asking for a No Objection-Certificate from Pune police in order to allow residents to enter the society. Please note that there is no requirement of NOC from Pune police and guidelines regarding quarantine should be followed.”Sanjeev Sharma, secretary of Viola Cooperative Society in Bibwewadi said that NOC was being demanded as a precautionary and safety measure, but with the police directives it will be withdrawn. “We request the health department to issue clear cut guidelines for quarantine as residents are still not clear about it,” he said.Daljeet Goraya, secretary, Ganga Kingston in Wanowrie said, “We have not received clear guidelines from the civic body regarding quarantine of residents, police NOC and other safety guidelines.

29-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi government organises awareness camp on desert locust attack||Following directions from Delhi Development Minister Gopal Rai, authorities on Friday organised a campaign to create awareness among farmers to prevent a probable attack of desert locusts in the national capital.Officials said the agriculture unit of the Development Department organised a training-cum-demonstration camp in Daryapur village in North Delhi in coordination with the officers of Krishi Vigyan Kendra.The Delhi government had on Thursday asked authorities concerned to spray insecticides and pesticides on crops and vegetation to prevent a probable desert locust attack, with Rai saying an awareness campaign would be run over the issue.Joint Director, Agriculture Department, A P Saini in the advisory issued on Wednesday asked the authorities to organise awareness programmes for public and farmers to prevent the attack of locusts in the national capital.“As the swarm of locusts flies in daytime, and rests during the night, it should not be allowed to rest at night,” the advisory read.It asked the authorities to carry out spraying of pesticides chlorpyrifos and malathion.Also, Delhi’s forest department is considering covering the saplings in its nurseries with polythene to protect them against the desert locust attack.“It is not possible to cover the trees. We will at least cover the saplings in the nurseries,” Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Ishwar Singh said.“Covering plants with polythene can also counter-productive during this heat. So, we will do this only when we know for sure that the swarm of locusts is headed towards Delhi,” the official said.Singh said in a city like Delhi, spraying of chemicals can be detrimental for environment.“If we spray the vegetation, trees and plants with chemical in anticipation of a locust attack, we should also consider how dangerous it will be for the environment,” he said.There are 14 lakh saplings in 14 government nurseries across Delhi, Singh said.India is battling the worst desert locust outbreak. The crop-destroying swarms first attacked Rajasthan and have now spread to Punjab, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.According to experts, broadly four species of locusts are found in India -- desert locust, migratory locust, Bombay locust and tree locust.The desert locust is considered the most destructive. It multiplies very rapidly and is capable of covering 150 kilometers in a day.This insect, a type of a grasshopper, can eat more than its body weight. A one square kilometer of locust swarm containing around 40 million locusts can in a day eat as much food as 35,000 people.Experts blame the growing menace of desert locusts on climate change. They say breeding of locusts is directly related to soil moisture and food availability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-government-organises-awareness-camp-on-desert-locust-attack/story-XR66RvDx8gmL1M58VWcM6O.html
29-05-2020||Chandigarh||Two families allege mismanagement of Covid-19 patients in J&K||Two families in a letter to the Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor alleged mismanagement of patients in the Union Territory and demanded that action be taken against the doctors concerned.Both quarantined patients are residents of Baramulla, they are in their 20s and had been studying in a Delhi College.In a letter to L-G Girish Chandra Murmu, the patients’ families wrote, “On May 16, my cousin arrived in Jammu from Delhi. His samples were taken at the railway station after which he was allowed to go home. On the same day, he was quarantined at Welkin School in Sopore with eleven others.” “On May 23, he was brought to Baramulla and another sample was collected. He was later sent back to Sopore quarantine centre. On May 25, the Jammu sample came out negative. But on Wednesday, he received a call from the district administration asking him to reach Degree College, Baramulla, with all family members, relatives, and friends whom he had met as his test had come out positive,” the letter, which has been circulating on social media, reads.“We fail to understand how his results differed in a couple of days. There is utter chaos and confusion,” said one of the patients’ relatives, who wrote to the L-G.‘POOR FACILITIES’He also complained about poor facilities at the quarantine centre. “They were kept in two rooms. Six persons in each room,” he said, adding, “We demand action against such doctors and administration.” This is not for the first time that the administration has come under fire for mismanagement. Last month, too, a 70 year-old from Sopore was discharged, however, later his results came out to be positive.On Thursday, six persons from Pulwama, who had tested positive were allowed to go home before their results were out. The government has ordered a probe into the matter. “The government must take strict action against doctors who are not performing their jobs seriously putting people’s lives at risk,” said a person admitted in a quarantine centre at Baramulla.DOCTORS BLAME TECHNICAL ISSUES, INCUBATION PERIODA senior doctor at a government hospital in Jammu says the problem may be because of ‘overloading of tests’.Baramulla chief medical officer (CMO) Deeba Khan said, “Tests may come negative in the incubation period and later come out to be positive.” She added the problem may arise due to technical faults in the machinery as a huge number of tests are conducted on a daily basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/two-families-allege-mismanagement-of-covid-19-patients-in-j-k/story-LiAoV8zTjhpWuBUnMHerPI.html

29-05-2020||Jaipur||Is Thar, the new home of Indian leopard||Leopards are now looking for new habitats, places where they were never seen before, this search for new territory was highlighted by researchers from Udaipur and Jodhpur in their study.Satish Sharma, a renowned environmental scientist and retired Assistant Conservator of Forests of Udaipur; Shravan Singh Rathore, Medical Officer of Machia Biological Park, Jodhpur; and Vijay Koli, Assistant Professor and Environmentalist of Mohanlal Sukhadia University, The National Academy of Sciences, in their research paper published in India, said that leopards (Panthera pardus, or tendua in Hindi) usually lives near evergreen forests and residential areas. However, setting a new normal, these big cats have now started moving towards the Thar Desert over the last decade where it never had a presence earlier.The paper, titled “Leopard expansion and movement towards the Thar Desert of Rajasthan”, states that the leopard -- a large cat specie which is mainly found on the edges of deciduous, evergreen, shrubby forest and human habitation, but whose presence was still absent in the arid regions of Rajasthan (Thar desert) and Gujarat (Kutch region) and high Himalayan regions is changing.According to Koli, “The presence of this species was recorded from five districts of Rajasthan which are found in the extension range of Thar Desert.”He said that this species was found in different types of habitats in Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Churu, Barmer and Bikaner districts in places like university campuses, factory campuses, near fields, surrounded by wells, bush extension areas and human habitat areas. The most amazing fact that all the identified leopards were male, he said further.Koli said that his research based on 14 incidents reported in the last 10 years in five districts, found the presence of these leopards in the area stretching from 55.4 km to 413.4 km from district borders in the Thar Desert. In most of these cases, these male leopards were caught by the forest department and then released into their designated boundary area.Environmental scientist Satish Sharma says that leopards generally maintain their territory. They do not allow the second panther to enter the territory. Therefore, it is difficult for all male panthers to live in a fixed boundary area due to increasing number of leopards in a fixed boundary area or simultaneously increasing number of male leopards. Powerful males establish their limits, but weak or defeated males have to migrate and move to another place. So when the number of leopards increase in a particular region, the new males move to other areas in search of their independent territory. Such cases have also been seen in Ranthambore where Tigers moved to other areas as its numbers increased, he added.According to Sharma, another reason is the increase in irrigation facilities, farming and plantation activities in the Thar Desert due to the presence of Indira Gandhi Canal. All these actions have increased the amount of vegetation cover in Thar desert. Also, there is availability of water throughout the year. All these conditions provide a favourable environment for the leopard’s presence.The third reason is the increase in domesticated animals and wildlife in the Thar Desert, which leopards can feed on throughout the year, he added.Researcher Shravan Singh Rathore, Medical Officer of Machia Biologic Park, Jodhpur, says that in the present research, it has been found that at present only male leopards are entering the Thar Desert. If female leopard also enters here in future, then these species can establish its presence in the Thar desert permanently. In addition, there is a possibility that in the future, cases of human-leopard conflict may increase in these areas.

Trees were uprooted, electricity poles felled and billboards were downed.Surinder Singh, a farmer from Baran village, said the rain will help the soil regain its humidity, which is good for paddy transplant.Inundated roads in certain parts of Patiala made commuting an uphill task for motorists. Many commuters had to wade through waterlogged roads and streets in the district.COMMUTERS BLINDED BY DUST IN LUDHIANA The high-velocity winds in Ludhiana led to scattering of dust accumulated at construction sites. Commuters, especially those travelling on two wheelers, found it tough to cross the Ferozepur Road where the flyover project is underway.The dust was emerging the constructing site was blinding the commutes. Many travellers were seeing stopping their vehicles or taking the slip road to avoid dust.Many pedestrians were seen covering their faces to protect themselves from dust.Gurmeet Singh Sondhi, a banker, said that water should be sprinkled alongside the construction site to safeguard commuters.Pooja, a resident of Sham Nagar, said dust had also entered people’s homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/thundershowers-bring-respite-from-heat-wave-in-ut-malwa-region-temperature-dips-across-punjab/story-fCDGYvuNRWe4uV1puD9ilK.html

29-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab-origin GOP lawyer fights California governor on stay-at-home orders||Long before Harmeet Dhillon became the leader of the legal fight against California’s stay-at-home order, she was a new elementary school student in North Carolina uncomfortable because she didn’t know the Christian prayer her classmates recited every morning.She told her mother, who had studied the Constitution for her citizenship test after the Sikh family emigrated to the United States from India. Her mother spoke to the principal about the legality of having public school students reciting a prayer.AROUND A DOZEN LAWSUITS FILED The school changed its policy, Dhillon said. That moment was her initial lesson in the First Amendment that four decades later would be one of the underpinnings for more than a dozen lawsuits she helped to file over the coronavirus-induced order in California that closed businesses, churches and beaches, restricted people’s movements and produced record high unemployment.AGAINST ‘GOVERNMENT OVERREACH’During the Trump presidency, Dhillon, 51, has emerged as one of California’s most prominent Republican voices, appearing regularly on Fox News and suing the state’s Democratic leaders to block what she believes to be government overreach. She is one of California’s two elected members of the Republican National Committee, and she’s a co-chair of ‘Women for Trump’ that is part of the president’s re-election campaign.While Democratic governor Gavin Newsom has started relaxing restrictions on his stay-at-home mandate that took effect March 19, Dhillon has no plans to stop filing lawsuits.“Until we have some guardrails around this governor, or future governors, and their behavior and their ability to violate our civil rights, we are not going to stop,” she said in a recent interview. “It’s unacceptable.”Dhillon has brought cases on behalf of small business owners, beachgoers, hairstylists and churches. Most say their free speech and other rights were unnecessarily trampled by Newsom’s order. She has also filed lawsuits against the Democratic governors of New Jersey and Virginia over their restrictions on religious services.VICTORY IN COURT ELUSIVE Dhillon so far has yet to get a victory in court, however. Last week, the 9th US circuit court of appeals upheld Newsom’s ban on in-person religious gatherings. In another case, a judge denied Dhillon and other lawyers’ requests to block Newsom from closing Orange County beaches.But in both cases, Newsom ultimately relented — beaches reopened after restrictions were imposed by local governments, and religious services now are allowed if houses of worship follow state guidelines.Dhillon’s most recent virus-related lawsuit was filed on behalf of the California Republican Party and the Republican National Committee to block Newsom’s executive order that all registered voters in the state be mailed a ballot for the November election as a safeguard against the virus. She said the governor overstepped his bounds, and it’s up to the legislature to determine how elections are conducted.California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat, called the lawsuit “another part of Trump’s political smear campaign against vote-by-mail.” The president says, without evidence, that mail-in voting will lead to fraud.Newsom’s office and political advisors did not directly address Dhillon’s lawsuits. But spokesman Nathan Click said Newsom :moved swiftly to protect human life” and that California has flattened the virus curve and helped vulnerable residents stay safe.“Protecting health and well-being of all Californians will continue to be what drives his actions — not politics,” Click said in a statement.TWO DECADE LAW CAREER Dhillon has practiced law in California for two decades. But she only recently emerged as a leader of the political right’s legal fights.After moving to California in 2000, she was involved at the grassroots level in San Francisco Republican politics before twice unsuccessfully running for the state Legislature in one of the country’s most liberal cities. She chaired the city’s Republican Party before winning election as vice chair of the state GOP in 2013.She has won national attention from conservative media for her work.Laura Ingraham, the Fox News host and a fellow Dartmouth College alumnus who graduated a few years before Dhillon, has praised her “great work” on the lawsuits. Dhillon counts Dinesh DiSouza, another Dartmouth graduate and conservative provocateur, as a mentor.LAWSUITS NOT PARTISAN: DHILLONDhillon said her lawsuits are not partisan. She noted that she has teamed with political opposites in some of her lawsuits, notably Mark Geragos, the Los Angeles-based celebrity lawyer whose clients included Michael Jackson and Colin Kaepernick.“The governor’s policies and the policies of counties are falling more heavily on Democrats than Republicans because there are more Democrats than Republicans in the state,” Dhillon said.Most of the lawsuits were filed through the Center for American Liberty, a nonprofit Dhillon helped launch in 2018 to take on civil-liberties focused legal work, but some are through her private law firm based in the San Francisco Bay Area, the Dhillon Law Group. The nonprofit does not have to disclose its donors.Dhillon represented the California Republican Party in a successful challenge last year to a law aimed at requiring Trump to release his tax returns to be on the California ballot.Mike Madrid, a California Republican who is leading a national anti-Trump effort, said the state’s Republican Party is in such bad electoral shape that lawsuits are now its main strategy.“It may be fun and you may get a soundbite, but is it making a difference? No. In fact it’s reinforcing the bad image of the Republican Party,” he said of Dhillon’s recent lawsuits.Her conservative views were shaped by her parents, who emigrated from the Punjab region of India when Dhillon was a baby. When she was 16, she went to Dartmouth. Her viewpoints hardened as she joined the Dartmouth Review, the renowned conservative college newspaper at the famously liberal school.“I learned a lot about writing. I learned a lot about arguing. I learned a lot about standing up for what you believe regardless of what the majority thinks,” she said.A defining moment came in 1988, when three of Dhillon’s classmates on the paper were suspended following an altercation with a professor. The Review sued to get the students reinstated and eventually won.It marked a turning point for Dhillon, who studied classics and planned to become a doctor like her father. Instead, she became a lawyer, clerking in the US department of justice’s civil division and later on the fourth circuit court of appeals in Baltimore.Dhillon joined the board of the American Civil Liberties Union after the September 11, 2001, attacks to further her work on discrimination against Sikhs and South Asians. Her affiliation with an organisation many Republicans see as overtly pro-Democrat was an issue when she ran as party vice chair in 2013, but she won anyway.‘ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT REPUBLICAN VOICES’Jim Brulte, then the chairman of the state party, said he encouraged Dhillon to become a more public face for the party and in 2016, to run for the Republican National Committee. He now considers her one of the most prominent Republican voices in California, behind only U.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes.“She’s a great spokesperson. She’s highly intelligent, very articulate,” he said.Asked whether she thinks her political affiliation will color how people perceive her legal efforts, Dhillon said: “I don’t really care how people perceive it, honestly. There’s nobody else doing it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-origin-gop-lawyer-fights-california-governor-on-stay-at-home-orders/story-RlAcpbtPIZ2bpjeWl9TUgM.html

29-05-2020||Chandigarh||Patients coughing up ₹1,800-5,000 for PPE kits of health workers in Chandigarh tricity’s private hospitals||Treatment just got more expensive in the tricity’s private hospitals with patients being asked to cough up anything between Rs 1,800 to Rs 5,000 for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE kits) and Rs 50 for sanitisers used – not by them – but by health workers as protection against Covid-19, it has been learnt.Hospitals say they are passing off costs of protection kits to patients to balance increasing expenses due to Covid-19 safety protocols put in place by health authorities.A woman treated at Alchemist hospital in Panchkula who did not want her name revealed said she was shocked to find she had been billed Rs 18,000 for nine PPE kits. “I delivered a baby at the hospital and was shocked to find Rs 18,000 added to the bill for nine PPE kits, of which seven were used by health workers during my surgery (Rs 1,800 each for six kits and Rs 2,400 for one kit) and two for the baby (Rs 2,400 per kit),” she says.When she questioned the hospital she was told all patients were being charged for the safety kits.When asked to comment on the matter, a hospital spokesperson also not wishing to be named, said, “We are following Haryana health department guidelines and are charging as per the guidelines and not charging unnecessarily.”A Chandigarh resident who went to Chaitanya Hospital in the city for some tests was surprised when he was charged Rs 50 for a sanitiser. Confirming the costs, Dr Neeraj Kumar, director of the hospital, said Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000 was also being charged for PPE kits.“We have to take precautions because of Covid-19. Hygiene has to be maintained, OPD area is cleaned every two hours and more house staff is employed. Fewer patients are coming in while hospital expenses have increased,” Dr Kumar said.‘10% extra fee can be charged’The Indian Medical Association (IMA), Dr Kumar added, had said that 10% extra fee could be charged from patients in outpatient departments as sanitation expenses had increased. The cost of the PPE also depended on the kind of surgery being performed. “On an average, Rs 5,000 is charged for a PPE kit from patients,” he said.When contacted, however, Dr Rajesh Dhir, president, IMA, Chandigarh, said, “I am not aware of any such percentage being allowed by IMA. However, I believe that the private hospitals should maintain a balance while charging the amount so that it does not pinch the pocket of the customer but at the same time doctors too don’t feel demotivated as it has become too expensive to run health services during the pandemic.”All hospitals were passing on costs of safety measures to patients. “My elder brother is undergoing dialysis from one private hospital in Mohali and we went to Fortis Hospital for some medical intervention, where they charged Rs 4,200 for PPE,” said Mohit Sharma from Chandigarh.When asked to respond, Ajey Maharaj, head, corprorate communications, Fortis Healthcare, said costs of safety measures had driven up expenses in hospitals. Confirming that patients were billed for PPE, he said, “as per the government directive, hospital medical staff in direct contact of the patients are advised to use good quality PPE kits and masks. Where PPE is required for treatment, cost of actual PPE being used is charged. In ICUs or wards with multiple patients, the total cost of PPEs is divided by the number of patients in the ward. Also, to ensure minimal impact on patient, PPE is being charged at much lower rates than the MRP.”‘Overcharging, irrational usage’Meanwhile, when contacted, Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said an order had been issued about overcharging for PPE kits in certain hospitals. It read that irrational usage and overcharging for PPE kits had been observed in certain private hospitals, adding unnecessary burden to the patients. “A serious note of this is being taken and all private hospitals are directed to use PPEs as per guidelines already issued. Cost of these if passed on to the patient should be justified and not unnecessarily included in the bill,” she added.The order also reads that any such complaints by the patients will be viewed seriously and appropriate action would be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/patients-coughing-up-1-800-5-000-for-ppe-kits-of-health-workers-in-chandigarh-tricity-s-private-hospitals/story-S9cHQd2TuqbwMiV7GLaaoK.html

29-05-2020||Business||India’s economy seen slowing rapidly in March quarter, with worse to come||Gross domestic product data out later on Friday is expected to show India’s economy grew at its slowest pace in at least two years in the March quarter as the coronavirus pandemic weakened already declining consumer demand and private investment.The median forecast from a Reuters poll of economists put annual economic growth at 2.1% in the March quarter, lower than 4.7% in the December quarter. Forecasts ranged between +4.5% and -1.5%.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has maintained the lockdown ordered on March 25 to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the world’s second most populous country, though many restrictions were eased for manufacturing, transport and other services from May 18.The full impact of the lockdown on manufacturing and services will become more apparent in the June quarter, with Goldman Sachs predicting a 45% contraction from a year ago.Economists expect the fiscal year that began in April will see the worst economic contraction in four decades.“Economic activity will face ongoing disruption over the next year as the country transitions to a post-COVID-19 world,” the rating agency S&P said on Thursday, cutting its 2020/21 forecast to a 5% contraction.Weather forecasts for normal monsoon rains are in Indian farmers’ favour at least, giving hope that the rural sector can help support the millions of migrant workers who returned to their villages from the cities when the lockdown began.Number of coronavirus affected people in India has crossed 158,000 with 4,531 deaths, with an average daily jump of 6,000 cases in the last one week.Unlike some advanced economies, India’s stimulus package has largely focussed on subsidised credit to small businesses and farmers, while direct fiscal stimulus was limited to around 1% of the GDP, economists said.The Reserve Bank of India cut policy rates by 40 basis points earlier this month, and has reduced its key repo rate by 115 basis points since February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/india-s-economy-seen-slowing-rapidly-in-march-quarter-with-worse-to-come/story-bY9D5APSUy0Ed7013M0OPI.html

29-05-2020||Education||West Bengal students likely to attend classes on alternate days after schools reopen: Minister||Students of state-run schools in West Bengal are likely to attend classes on alternate days after they reopen, in order to observe social distancing norms.The schools will be asked to follow an “alternate model” and the department will ensure that classes take place adhering to social distancing norms, Education Minister Partha Chatterjee told reporters on Thursday.Asked to elaborate on the “alternate model”, he said details of it would be informed later.The alternate model envisages one set of students of a particular class will attend school on every alternate day, a source in the education department explained.To a question, Chatterjee said state-run schools are slated to reopen after June 30.Private educational institutes are free to follow this schedule or they may go by their own timetable, he said.However, the minister hinted that he expects private schools will follow the governments decision.“If a state-run school and a private school are situated in the same locality, the same yardstick should be applied to both, as students of the same locality will face similar situation,” Chatterjee said.He had announced on Wednesday that state-run schools will open after June 30 instead of June 10, as stated earlier, as many schools will be used as quarantine centres for people returning from outside the state and also due to the extensive damage caused to thousands of school buildings in cyclone Amphan.About communication problem faced by candidates who will appear for the remaining papers of the Higher Secondary Examinations, Chatterjee said the education department will arrange special buses for them.The remaining papers of the HS Examinations will be held on June 29, July 2 and 6.“We will also ask the West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education to keep examination centres in the neighbourhood area of a candidate, he said.Chatterjee said the results of class 10 state board examination (Madhyamik) will be published in the quickest possible time while that of the HS Examinations will be out within a month after exams for the pending papers are over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/west-bengal-students-likely-to-attend-classes-on-alternate-days-after-schools-reopen-minister/story-krflfFf2NylR7WdeqhI8gL.html
29-05-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Chitli’s deafening silence||If you listen, you can hear it. The silence.An absence of sound has descended over the Chitli Qabar Chowk like a shroud upon the body of the dead. The air is alive with the twittering of birds though, but that only intensifies this strange quietude.This reporter experienced the area’s starkly new silence during the course of a recent stay lasting 24 hours in a multi-storey house, situated right there in the Chowk. It is the only four-way crossroad in this part of the historic Walled City.In the morning, the centre of the Chowk used to be taken over by fish manger Muhammed Parvez. His ramshackle cart was an unofficial meeting point for the local gentry (always men) to gather and gossip about weather, politics as well as who died and who was born in which galli or kucha the previous night.But this morning, the fish cart is nowhere to be seen.Long after the morning, and throughout the day, the Chowk would be like a pressure cooker crammed up with all varieties of tumultuous sounds—the cries of flower sellers, biryani sellers, balloon sellers, passers-by, rickshaw pullers, beggars, tourists, dogs and goats. There would be azaans streaming out of the loudspeakers from neighbourhood mosques at appointed hours.But now all is stilled, except for the azaans; the mosques themselves are locked with noticed slapped on their doors, instructing the faithful to “pray at home.”Indeed, this afternoon barely any soul is seen in the Chowk. One side-alley going up to Pahari Rajaan has its giant wooden doorway shut closed.Later in the day, some of the shops and stalls that are permitted to operate open up for brief business, and the Chowk is restored to some aural stirrings.By evening, a few minutes after 7pm, the official beginning of the corona-triggered 12-hour curfew, the streets empty out totally.And finally, the day has unfolded and it is 10pm. No familiar faces, seen here every night during the BC (Before Corona) era are around—Muhammed Shakeer with his ice-cream cart, Raj Malik with his gas-filled balloons, and Muhammed Junaid, who manned the Burra Biryani stall. There’s also no sign of Mehboob tea stall, a pavement establishment that served adrak chai the whole night long.Now a man in white kurta pyjama steps into this setting. He looks around the emptiness, and walks away, perhaps towards his home, leaving Chitli Qabar to its silence. A silence so profound that you feel you could caress it with your own hands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-chitli-s-deafening-silence/story-hsVUqFFKxTfWFlTjd8EaXI.html
29-05-2020||Chandigarh||Subsidies for solar plants in Chandigarh to be released in two weeks||As the last date for installation of solar plants in private residences has been extended to March 2021, all pending subsidies for the same will be released in two weeks, the Chandigarh Renewal Energy and Science and Technology Promotion Society (CREST) has announced.Giving details, CREST CEO Debendra Dalai said, “Under phase 2 of installation, which comprises all solar plants set up after May 2019, the subsidies were delayed due to the lockdown. There are 650 such cases out of which we have released subsidies of around 400 cases. I am currently approving around 50 cases a day so the remaining subsidies will be released within the next two weeks.”In 2016, the UT administration had made installation mandatory of rooftop solar power plants in new properties measuring 500 square yards and above and in group housing societies. As per Dalai, there are around 7,200 such residential areas in the city. About 3,000 of them are yet to apply for permissions for setting up the plant. “The date had to be extended to give some time to these people to apply for as well as to set up the plant,” Dalai added.The UT has also proposed a Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) model (which provides energy to the consumers from renewable energy sources, usually solar photovoltaics and wind power) for setting up power plants due to which installation costs would come down, Dalai added.For residents who had installed the plants, it has been a long wait for subsidies. CREST releases a subsidy of 40% for power plants with a capacity 3 kilowatt (kW).The president of the Sector 8 resident welfare association (RWA), Ranvinder Singh Gill said, “After spending over Rs 4 lakh on the solar project, it is disheartening to not receive the subsidy. During the Covid-19 epidemic the government should make it a priority to pay back what they owe us. “Sector Sector 33 resident, Brig KS Gill (retd), aged 98 years, added that it was unfortunate that super senior citizens like him were also made to wait for subsidies.The Federation of Sector Welfare Association Chandigarh, Sandeep Bhalla said, “We had held a meeting with CREST in January 2020 and were assured that around Rs 5 crore in funds had been received by CREST for this payment, so I hope we receive it soon.” Crest has set a target of producing 69 megawatt (MW) power in the city by 2022, while currently the city produces over 30 MW. Of this, about 12 MW is from residential areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/subsidies-for-solar-plants-in-chandigarh-to-be-released-in-two-weeks/story-djS3FBv4Dubyve1x1L8FnN.html
29-05-2020||Chandigarh||PU students’ body opposes proposed fee hike||Youth for Swaraj, a students’ organisation of Panjab University, has opposed the proposed fee hike for students taking admission in the varsity from the 2020-21 academic session.The PU syndicate in its upcoming meeting will take a call on the fee hike of 7.5 % in self-financed courses and 5% in all traditional courses for the new entrants.In a statement, the students’ body said with incomes of most families is taking a hit amid the Covid pandemic, such a steep fee hike will make it difficult for many families to afford education at PU.“Youth for Swaraj strongly opposes this move as it will make Panjab University inaccessible for many talented and meritorious students. Approximately 43% of all students at PU are in self-financed courses, with already high and unjust tuition fee ranging from ₹31,000 to 2.45 lakh. Any further increase in fees during this crisis is condemnable,” they said.The student party demanded that the University Syndicate reject this proposal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-students-body-opposes-proposed-fee-hike/story-D5Rdzf5QeSfDKrTeocNL5N.html

They have formulated a very poor strategy and these guidelines lack clarity.”Nikhil Narmeta, president of the Panjab University National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) said, “If students from containment zones and red zones are not allowed in the examination centres, what is the alternative that will be provided to them?”PU’s controller of examinations, Parvinder Singh said, “PU authorities have taken cognizance of the unanticipated situation and notified SOPs for the conduct of semester examinations in July.”“If a student cannot appear in the examination as they reside in a red zone or containment zone, permission will be granted for special examination later.

29-05-2020||Chandigarh||As Covid-19 restrictions go in Sectors 38 and 52, residents are cautious but happy to be ‘free’||De-sealing Sector 38 to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and lifting containment zone restrictions in Sector 52 on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, have come as a relief for residents.Sumit Kumar, a 14-year-old boy, said he was thrilled to finally visit his best friend living close by in Sector 52, where one Covid-positive case was reported. For 28 days from May 1, locked in his house, Kumar and many more children like him were forbidden from playing outdoors as houses were sealed and movement restricted.Sector 38, from where three positive cases were reported, was sealed on April 30. All patients have recovered.“We have realised what freedom truly means now,” said Ramlal, Kumar’s father, thanking the police and Chandigarh administration officials with folded hands as barricades were removed from Sector 52.Police officials present in the area too said it was good that the residents would finally get some respite. Talking to the public, a police person who did not want to be named said: “Many people here complained about the inconveniences of living in a sealed area and now they are free. These steps were only taken for their safety.”Her employer was not very happy with the fact that she could not attend office, so Shweta Kumari, 22, was looking forward to joining work in a private firm. “I could not get out of because of the restrictions and am relieved to be able to get to work,” she said.Bihari Lal, 30, said his worries mounted as his savings depleted. “Now rejoining work at the confectionary store in Sector 44 will get things back on track. For people, the lockdown was lifted a month ago, for us, it opened today,” he said.For 37-year-old Manjot Singh, a driver and resident of Sector 38, it was traumatic to live in a sealed residential area. “First, it was the Covid-19 threat and then we were isolated and living in suspense, not knowing when the restrictions would be lifted. None of us will forget this phase in our lives.”Also living in Sector 38, Madhu Lata, a home maker, said getting fresh vegetables, milk and essential items was difficult. “Our children could not buy the books they needed. Getting medicines for my mother-in-law was an impossible task.”When it comes to other areas in the city, containment in Shastri Nagar will end on May 31. Only three areas, including Sector 30 B, Kachi Colony in Dhanas, Bapu Dham Colony will remain containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/as-covid-19-restrictions-go-in-sectors-38-and-52-residents-are-cautious-but-happy-to-be-free/story-HE26poApsqoxcD2JnTI1VO.html

According to the PU calendar, the senate may appoint the DSW for a certain period on the recommendation of the V-C, and the syndicate may determine the conditions for such terms. The calendar lays down the same procedure for appointment of DSW (woman). TOUGH FOR V-C TO GET NAMES APPROVEDHowever, as per sources, Devinder Singh may not garner support from majority of the syndicate members as he is close to the BJP Group. Majority of the syndicate members are from the opposition group.Goyal Alliance, which is seen to be pro-Congress, has 11 seats and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Group has only four seats in the syndicate.A syndicate member, on condition of anonymity said, “I think the members will not agree on the candidates recommended by the V-C. As the term of the DSW is going to end, an additional charge can be given to someone as till the new DSW is appointed.”CONTROVERSY OVER DSW LAST YEAROn May 28 last year, the V-C had given his disapproval when syndicate members recommended the extension for Nahar as PU’s DSW. Later, the V-C removed him as DSW after which the matter went to Punjab and Haryana high court.

It had even added numerous features, such as an aviary and new ticket counters, besides carrying out road maintenance to attract more visitors. With no scope of government funds this year, further development activities are unlikely.Besides, the zoo spends about Rs 30 lakh a month on meat, fodder, grains, fruits and vegetables for the animals. “Though there is no revenue generation, we are not cutting down on expenses incurred on feed, fodder or health care of the animals. The zoo was aiming at becoming self-reliant in two years but that seems difficult now,” said a zoo official, not willing to be named. Zoo field director M Sudhaga said, “Owing to the pandemic, there is a downfall in the revenue generation. We had collected about Rs 6.2-crore revenue last year.” The revenue came through outsourcing of the parking, canteen and lion safari-- all of which have been closed due to the pandemic. The tickets are priced at Rs 80 for adults and Rs 40 for children which contributes to generating revenue of Rs 1.8 lakh daily on an average. Lion and deer safari tickets cost Rs 75 per visitor. The zoo used to have around 3,000 visitors a day.With the loss of income eating into the savings of the zoo, the authorities have now approached the Punjab government for relaxations. The cabinet had last year directed Chhatbir zoo to deposit funds collected in the zoo society funds after deducting the expenses and use the rest of the funds after taking permission from the government.DINOSAUR PARK HIT TOO The Punjab government had planned to open a Dinosaur Park on two acres in the zoo but that plan is also likely to be put on the back-burner. “The park is being developed on public-private partnership (PPP) mode and work had started on it but now the private partner has sought some relaxations from the government,” informed a senior official.As per the proposal, six dinosaurs will be made in the park of which four will be robotic and two will be interactive models.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/brakes-on-chhatbir-zoo-s-expansion-plans-as-revenue-takes-a-hit-amid-lockdown/story-QPKbRvJtIyIm569z4SEbxO.html

The file has been sent to the Punjab cabinet for the final approval, which is expected in June.The industrial zones in Mohali under GMADA are in Sectors 83, 84 and 103. So far, land pooling schemes were offered only for residential projects.Under the industrial scheme, an owner whose 8-kanal land will be acquired for a project will get an 1,100 square yards developed industrial site and a 200 square yards developed SCO site. For 4-kanal land acquisition, a land owner will get a 550 square yards commercial residential site and a 100 square yard SCO site. The sites will be excluding the parking area.“Our motive is to promote industry in the region and make land owners our business partners. The file has been sent to the Punjab cabinet,” GMADA chief administrator Tanu Kashyap said.Yogesh Sagar, president of the Mohali Industries Association (MIA), said this scheme will definitely promote the industry in the region. But GMADA should also come up with concessional pricing for the existing industry, he said.Recently, GMADA had also increased compensation for land owners opting for its land pooling scheme for various residential projects. Instead of 121 square yards, the authority will now offer the land owners a commercial plot of 200 square yards.COMMERCIAL USE OF INDUSTRIAL PLOTS ALREADY ALLOWEDIn January this year, giving relief to industrialists operating in focal points of Mohali, the Punjab Small Industries Export Corporation Limited (PSIEC) had allowed commercial use of industrial plots in the state. There are around 2,000 units operating in Phases 7, 8 and 9 focal points.As per the notification, 30% of the plot area can be used for commercial activities, which means the owners can open showrooms, retail outlets and other commercial units. Earlier, only 10% of the plot area was allowed to be used for commercial activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gmada-comes-up-with-land-pooling-scheme-for-industry-in-mohali/story-vUowPQUwXbGizFIr65Dv5H.html

29-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh likely to open up hotel, restaurant services from June 1||Hotels and restaurants are likely to open in Chandigarh from June 1, with the UT administration said to be “actively considering” the matter.As all modes of road, rail and air transport had opened with riders and there was movement of people between states and cities, backup services in terms of accommodation and food were required, said a senior UT official who wished to remain anonymous after a video conference with the cabinet secretary on Thursday.The UT administrator will take a final decision, however, depending on the guidelines issued by the Central government, he added.The hospitality industry was closed March 24 ever since the curfew to prevent the spread of Covid-19 was imposed even though the UT administration announced a slew of measures while lifting restrictions for businesses and industries as part of Lockdown 4.0.‘PROHIBITORY’ CATEGORYAccording to current Central guidelines, hotels and restaurants come under the prohibitory category, that is, these cannot be opened even if outside the containment zones.The only relaxation allowed by the administration so far, at the start of the Lockdown 4.0, was allowing restaurants to open for takeaways.“As in the case of public transport opening up in the fourth phase of the lockdown, restaurants and hotels will be allowed to open with strict guidelines, particularly with strictly restricted occupancy. The administration will come up with standard operating procedures for the hospitality industry,” said the official.Industry hit hardestThe industry is among those hit hardest by the lockdown.Ankit Gupta, president, Chandigarh Hospitality Association, said, “The industry is on the verge of collapsing in the city if not allowed to open soon. It’s running into huge losses and also facing large-scale reverse migration of industry workers. The government can keep banquet and other halls closed, but individual dining should be allowed. Procedures regarding social distancing and other precautions can be laid down.”BOX60% Bapu Dham could be de-sealed on June 1The administration will take call on opening up nearly 60% of the Bapu Dham Colony in Sector 26, both in the containment and buffer zones, by May 31.This decision is likely to be based primarily on Central guidelines of no positive cases in a specific area in 28 days for de-sealing.Bapu Dham, the epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic in the city, is one of the six containment zones here.Three have already been declared containment free.“While, positive cases are being reported daily from Bapu Dham, these are limited to a few pockets. Out of the total 20 pockets in the area, two are within the containment zone and that too from just one pocket. In the buffer zone too some cases were positive but these were also limited to one pocket. We will open pockets with no case as it has been more than a month since these were sealed,” said a senior UT official.When contacted, UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida, said, “The UT administrator will take a final decision on it by May 31 as per Central government guidelines.”Meanwhile, the administration has already allowed migrant workers to leave the buffer zone after proper screening. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-likely-to-open-up-hotel-restaurant-services-from-june-1/story-tZF344e1tPjETElbAHsRTO.html

Officials of department of posts, Ludhiana, who have been working to provide door-to-door pension to beneficiaries since the first week of April, say postmen witness issues related to mismatched or incomplete biometric details daily, due to which they have not been able to carry out transactions through Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS). Punjab Circle has performed 3.89 lakh AEPS transactions and disbursed ₹61.15 crore at the doorsteps of pensioners since the lockdown was imposed. There are around 2.13 lakh pension beneficiaries in the Ludhiana district. Shamina Khatun, 30, a resident of Shyam Nagar, who visited the Rajguru Nagar post office branch on Thursday to withdraw ₹1,000 (two instalments of ₹500 each) was unable to do so since the machine was unable to match her fingerprints to the account. “The staff here informed me that this happens only when your account is not linked with Aadhaar. I need money at this time. There is no fixed date as to when Aadhaar services will resume. What is the use of receiving the benefit when I can’t even use it during this difficult period,” Khatun said. “The elderly are fearful of stepping outside the house due to Covid-19. So, post offices have been very crucial at this time for pension distribution and cash withdrawal,” said Sarita Madan, sub-postmaster of Rajguru branch. Madan said the branch had been receiving many queries from the public regarding resumption of Aadhaar-related services. “We are receiving queries from the public in general and even some industrialists who want to get their Aadhaar card updated. In the last week, there have regularly been four to five labourers whose Aadhaar card are lost or want to make some updates. Some workers seek Aadhaar as a proof for online train booking to go to their home states,” she added. Ludhiana’s senior superintendent of post office, Amanpreet Singh, said the postal department had not received any instructions from the government to resume Aadhaar services so far. “Aadhaar enrolment or update services were suspended by the government amid the Covid-19 pandemic since it involved thumb impression and iris scanning. We have received demand for the service from the public and we can also start it following government’s instruction,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/suspension-of-aadhaar-related-services-leaves-scheme-beneficiaries-in-ludhiana-helpless/story-9EATmq4EOTYtnaBR7wwaYM.html

29-05-2020||Chandigarh||Building branch failed to keep online record of CLU, ED charges: Ludhiana MC panel||An MC committee on Thursday revealed that the building branch had failed to maintain the online record of charges levied and challans issued under change of land use (CLU) and external development (ED).The MC committee, which met at Zone D office, has sought a report on the said charges levied in various municipal zones.Councillors Mamta Ashu, Dr Jai Prakash, Sunny Bhalla, Dilraj Singh and OP Ratra among others attended the meeting, besides MC additional commissioner Rishipal Singh and joint commissioner Kulpreet Singh.The committee has also sought a report on how the non-compoundable (those that can’t be regularised) buildings, which were sealed by the MC in the past, had been allowed to open.In January, the committee had accused the building branch staff of levying different charges in every municipal zone to favour builders and building owners. The committee had said MC officials had charged the rates approved by the state government in 2017 against many buildings, even though these rates were disapproved by the MC general house.Councillor Ashu said, “In the January meeting, the committee members had sought a report regarding the buildings which had been approved in the past by municipal town planner (MTP) Monica Anand within two days, but it has still not been submitted. Now, the officials have claimed that the report would be submitted in the next meeting. In that report, the MTP has been asked to list the orders of authorities concerned based on which the charges were collected from building owners.”The state government had approved new CLU and EDC rates in 2017. But the MC house had rejected the same and officials were directed to continue charging the 2014 rates. However, the building branch officials have been imposing both the rates (whichever is less) in different MC zones to benefit the builders, said Mamta Ashu adding that an illegal 10 storey building was constructed in Feroze Gandhi market area, but no action had been taken against the same. “It is surprising that building branch officials have not uploaded the challans issued against the buildings in the last five months and illegal buildings are being constructed in the city. The committee has sought action against the officials for their failure to upload the information. The officials have been told to submit the report in four days, following which, action would be recommended against the erring staff members,” said Ashu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/building-branch-failed-to-keep-online-record-of-clu-ed-charges-ludhiana-mc-panel/story-tG3sI9HGbDzq7Kxi7Z8N9L.html

While the seven executive committee members claimed that they had gathered for an official meeting at the club, DC Pardeep Agrawal had summoned a report of the same from Mahajan, who along with two other women executive members, did not go to the club that day.Mahajan said the executive members were captured in the closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras while moving out with cases of beer carrying 109 bottles.

The cases were taken out because the beer had expired and the bottles were destroyed, the members in question have claimed.“As per the rumours, the security supervisor, who was deputed at the club on Sunday and had captured the incident on his mobile phone, has ‘not been approachable’ since Monday. It is also being said that the members had got the video deleted from his phone and allegedly terminated his services, but no proof of the same has come to light till now,” said Mahajan.Sources at the club said the security supervisor has submitted a complaint with the DC regarding the entire incident.Mahajan said, “The members concerned have claimed that they went to the club for a meeting, which was called by sports secretary Dr Avinash Jindal for reviewing some projects of the club and they only had lunch, brought by one of the members from his house. In the CCTV footage, members were seen moving out with beer cases, but they said the beer had expired and they took out the same for destroying it.

The MC would bear the cost of fuel required to run the excavators.The nullah is the city’s main drain and desilting it is critical before the onset of monsoon to prevent overflowing of sewer waste and rainwater on the roads.In the past, the MC used to start desilting the nullah in the beginning of April, but it got delayed this time. Moreover, the fund-starved civic body decided to take up the job itself this year and saved lakhs of rupees it would otherwise pay to the irrigation department for the work.As the JCB machines were unable to clean the nullah properly due to their limited reach, the mayor had asked MC officials to rope in a private player for the same.“The Namdhari sect had cleaned the nullah a few months ago and the MC has also deployed JCB machines to clear garbage and silt from the drain, but it has been realised that poclain machines are necessary at some points. The nullah would be cleaned before monsoon hits the city so that residents do not face any trouble,” the mayor said.The nullah overflows in New Kundanpuri and Upkar Nagar areas almost every year during monsoon, and residents have to bear the brunt of MC’s delay in the desilting exercise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-mc-deploys-poclain-excavators-to-desilt-budhha-nullah/story-pKSO1E4XbU4yperlmZmlYL.html

29-05-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana: 4 market committee officials suspended for fraudulent activities, mustard procurement hit||Mustard procurement in Haryana turned murky when involvement of certain market committee officials in fraudulent activities surfaced, leading to their suspension. An inquiry has been initiated into the matter and we have suspended four market committee officials, confirmed additional chief secretary, agriculture and farmers’ welfare department, Sanjeev Kaushal on Friday.Mustard growers have, meanwhile, expressed their worries and said they haven’t been able to sell their produce for past more than a week.Procurement at many centres was stopped after the government received complaints regarding illegal activities involving some commission agents, farmers and market committee officials.They were allegedly selling the mustard bought from Rajasthan in the name of local farmers at the MSP of Rs 4,425 per quintal in state mandis. Additional chief secretary Kaushal said, “Some commission agents purchased the mustard from Rajasthan at rates Rs 600-700 lower than prescribed and sold the same in Haryana mandis with the help of certain farmers and market committee officials.” “We are registering FIRs against those involved in the scam. Most of the farmers have already sold their produce and the crop of remaining ones will be purchased after proper verification,” Kaushal added.‘WAITING FOR MY TURN FOR PAST 8 DAYS’The government has been procuring mustard (40 quintals from a farmer in one go) across 165 centres in the state.Sumod Kumar, a farmer from Bhiwani’s Surpura Khurd village, said the government had stopped purchasing their crop on May 20. “Many farmers from my village have sold their crop and few of them even received payment. But, I have been waiting for my turn for the past eight days. When I contacted commission agents and market committee officials, they told me that they will resume the process after getting a green signal from the government,” he said.“Mandi officials had issued tokens to farmers at Behal Mandi on May 20 and since then, many of them are waiting for resumption of procurement,” he added.However, since the procurement process was stopped across mandis, the private dealers have been reportedly buying mustard at ₹ 4,100 to 4,180 per quintal.Raj Bala, a farmer from Dadri’s Atela village, said she was worried as the government has not been procuring their produce for the past five days.“The commission agent had told me last week that my turn to sell mustard will come up by May 25. When I called him again, he told me that the mandi officials were not issuing tokens and the procurement process was put on hold. He assured me that I’d be informed if the government reopens mandis this week,” the farmer added.Dadri market committee secretary Suresh Khokar said the government had issued orders to stop the mustard purchase to ensure lifting of pending crop procured from commission agents and store the same at government godowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mustard-growers-in-haryana-fret-as-procurement-process-comes-to-halt/story-TAROV1moAqCWgFSleY1piK.html

I can battle this way [as a doctor],” said Meriya, who signed up as a volunteer for at least three months.Mumbai accounts for more than 32,000 of India’s 150,000 cases of the coronavirus, making it the worst-hit city. With government hospitals short of beds and health officials overworked, volunteers like Meriya are all the more important.Meriya began to dabble in DJing as a hobby at around the age of 20, while studying for his medical degree but said it then “took over me” – much to his family’s dismay.“They hated it. They still hate it,” he said of his decision to become a DJ.Although worried about his potential exposure to the virus, Meriya’s family is thrilled to see him back in medicine.“They now have a lot to share with all our relatives, if you know what I mean when it comes to Indian families,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-dj-swaps-deck-for-doctor-s-scrubs-to-fight-coronavirus/story-pAl2FDVh6iY6HcGki3EcPN.html

The company was mandated to submit its recommendations within 18 months, and is scheduled to share its final report of the master plan in October 2020.The meeting discussed the flood preparedness report prepared by the drainage administration of water resources department, and reviewed the situation and the state’s level of preparation to tackle any flooding.The CM directed the department to take all possible steps to ensure that there is no recurrence of floods like those witnessed last year in the state. The department was asked to maintain regular contact with the departments concerned, including the meteorological department, Government of India and the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB), to ensure that advance forecasts are received and disseminated well in time.With reservoirs filling up more due to the excessive snowfall this year, the CM directed the department to make all efforts to ensure that the Bhakra dam levels are kept under check with adequate cushion to receive the monsoon rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/flood-preparedness-rs-55-crore-sanctioned-for-de-silting-of-drains-in-punjab/story-lSLoF8ItAtyatzU3Ngqt9N.html

Worried about their jobs, PTIs from several districts of Haryana participated in the rally organised to raise voice against Supreme Court’s April 8 order upholding the decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court which had quashed the appointment of 1,983 PTIs made by the then Congress government in 2010. Karnal BJP Member of Parliament (MP) Sanjay Bhatia posted a video on his Facebook account in which he was seen addressing the gathering and assuring them that the government was concerned about their livelihood.“Aapke case ke liye maine apne dhar ki baaji lagai hui hai, mukhayamntri saheb ne kaha hai ki humein kisi ki naukari khane ka koi haq nahi hai (I’ve put my life on the line for your case, the CM has said that we have no right to take away anyone’s bread and butter),” he told the gathering. The MP, however, had made repeated requests not to hold the rally and gather in large numbers, but to no avail.Panipat deputy commissioner Dharmender Singh said, “Soon after the matter was brought to my knowledge, I sought an explanation from the station house officer of the area.” “Yes, this is a violation of the MHA guidelines as they did not seek any permission to hold the rally,” he added.When asked about the large gathering and the MP’s presence in the rally, he said, “It could not have been predicted as the MP was also under the impression that only a few people would turn up to give him a memorandum.” However, Bhatia could not be contacted for his comments over the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/physical-training-instructors-rally-panipat-dc-seeks-explanation-from-local-police/story-hJQjElSbQoOiZquMk13orM.html

29-05-2020||Mumbai||2 more doctors in city die of Covid-19; 1 had to ‘wait 2 days for ICU bed’||A 51-year-old general physician from Cheeta Camp, Trombay, died of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on May 26 at the Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital, also known as Sion Hospital, after allegedly waiting two days for an ICU bed. An ayurvedic doctor (general physician), who is in his 50s, from Andheri (East), also succumbed to the infection on Thursday afternoon at Somaiya hospital. He also used to practise as a vaastu consultant. Dr Bhagat Singh Patil, cultural secretary of Kurla doctor association, confirmed the fatality. This takes the Covid death toll of doctors in the city to five, with the Sion Hospital death the third from M-ward, one of the hotspots in the city. The Trombay doctor was brought to Sion Hospital early on May 24 by his 17-year-old son. As the hospital did not have a vacant ICU bed, the doctor was given a waiting-list number— 41 — and had to wait in a crowded casualty ward. His son said that owing to the lack of beds, patients were even lying on the floors between the beds. Finally, by the afternoon of May 25, he was shifted to the Covid ward, but succumbed to his infection the next day. “I kept requesting the doctors to give him a bed, but they told me that there were several like me who were making similar requests,” said his son.The physician used to run a clinic in his locality and also worked with the government ambulance service — 108 — at night as an emergency doctor to attend to Covid-19 patients. His family said he had complained of fever and cold for two-three days, but on May 23, he suddenly developed breathlessness. Around 11pm, he, along with his 17-year-old son, caught an autorickshaw and rushed to a nearby clinic. But they referred them to the civic-run Maa Hospital, which refused to admit the patient without a report confirming he had tested positive for the virus. “It was around 12am when we reached Shatabdi Hospital, but owing to the unavailability of beds, they didn’t admit my father. By then, his condition had deteriorated further. He kept telling me to arrange for oxygen for him as he couldn’t breathe, but I was all alone and didn’t know what to do,” said his son on the phone. The auto driver rushed them to Sion Hospital around 12.30am. His son said there was no stretcher and the auto driver and he carried the doctor to the casualty ward, where he was given a waiting number.“On the second day, another patient was asked to share the same bed. So, my husband had to sit confined to a corner of the bed to make space. He needed to be in the intensive care unit (ICU), but he was kept only on oxygen supply for two days,” said his wife. Around 12.30pm on May 26, he was declared dead. For two days, the doctor stayed at the casualty ward with the same clothes as no other family member came to help the teenager. “My siblings are too young (14 and 16 years) and my mother has never travelled alone, so I had no other option, but to take care of him alone. Due to lack of transport, other relatives couldn’t come,” said the son.Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of Sion Hospital, said that to address the issue of overcrowding of patients, they are trying to extend the number of Covid beds to 430. “We get one of the highest number of Covid cases in the city. Being a partially converted Covid hospital, we have to provide treatment both to infected and non-Covid patients.At present, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has 645 beds in ICU. Out of this, 99% are occupied. Out of the 373 ventilator beds, 72% are occupied. Dedicated Covid Hospitals with severe cases have 6,099 beds. Out of this, 96% are occupied. This is as per the data released by BMC on Thursday.“If anyone calls the helpline number— 1916 — it gets connected to a doctor who asked for symptoms of the suspected patient. Depending on the condition of the person, they will be allotted centres or hospitals for treatment,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-more-doctors-in-city-die-of-covid-19/story-VNVvmvGUNz6OaNux6iCu4K.html
29-05-2020||Chandigarh||Women were arm-twisted to accuse Amritsar temple priest of rape: Police||The case in which two women had alleged that they were raped at Dera Guru Gian Nath situated on the premises of a historic temple in Amritsar was a conspiracy to unseat the dera priest, police have found in the investigations. Two of the eight conspirators who arm-twisted the women to make false allegations have been arrested, police said. On May 18, police had arrested two priests and booked four people for rape on the complaint of two women, aged 25 and 45. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Vikramjit Singh Duggal told the media that when the medical report of the women didn’t confirm rape, the women were questioned. “They spilled the beans and told the police that it was a conspiracy of Tirath Singh, Joga Singh, Gopal Singh, Tarsem Singh, Vicky, Mandeep Singh, Sukhwinder Singh and Meghnath of different villages in Amritsar to unseat dera’s head Baba Girdhari Nath,” he said. The SSP said the women have told the police that the 14-year-old son of the elder of the two was also abducted by the eight accused to pressure them to do as desired. “The women said the accused had also offered ₹5 lakh to them for the work. We have also rescued the boy from the house of a relative of Tirath Singh in Mudhal village.”Both the women recorded their statements before a judge in Ajnala court under Section 164 of the CrPC, confessing that they were not raped, the SSP said.The SSP said they have also arrested two of the eight accused —Tirath Singh and Joga Singh. “Raids are on to nab the other accused,” he added. Police have now registered a fresh case against the eight accused under sections 195-A (threatening any person to give false evidence), 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 365 (kidnapping), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 506 (criminal intimidation), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/women-were-arm-twisted-to-accuse-amritsar-temple-priest-of-rape-police/story-EfTmpmI1kdJKAJGixu707H.html
29-05-2020||Mumbai||2,598 fresh infections take state tally closer to 60,000||Maharashtra on Thursday inched closer to the 60,000 Covid-19 cases mark as 2,598 fresh infections took the state tally to 59,546. With 85 more fatalities recorded, Maharashtra is also within touching distance of the bleak 2,000 mark for deaths due to the disease. The state has so far seen 1,982 deaths. There are 38,939 active cases in the state.Of the new cases on Thursday, Mumbai recorded 1,467 new infections, while Pune recorded 282 cases and Thane 439. Of the fatalities recorded on Thursday, 38 were in Mumbai, four each in Vasai-Virar and Thane, 10 in Pune, nine in Satara, seven in Solapur, five in Akola, three in Aurangabad, and one each in Raigad, Jalgaon and Nanded.However, the state health department said that of the total deaths reported on Thursday, 37 occurred in the past two days and the remaining 48 deaths are between May 15 and May 25. Out of the 48 deaths, 22 were recorded in Mumbai, five in Solapur, four in Akola, three each in Aurangabad, Satara, Thane and Vasai-Virar, one each in Jalgaon, Nanded, Navi Mumbai, Pune and Raigad.The state government is expecting a surge in the number of cases in the state in the next 10 to 15 days due to the allowances for the movement of people given in the last week. State government officials said the numbers would peak by mid-June. Officials said the reason for the increase would be further lockdown relaxations that would happen after May 31 and with the movement of people in the state, along with those coming into the state.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the movement of people from red-zone areas into other districts has led to an increase in Covid-19 cases elsewhere in the state. He added that the numbers are expected to surge in the next few days, but expressed confidence in the machinery and measures adopted to keep the spread under control.“[Overall] It is expected that the cases would increase, primarily, due to the movement of people. How long can we keep things under lockdown? With people from Mumbai going into other districts, the number of cases has gone up. For instance, Jalna had a handful of cases [earlier this month]. Today, it has increased to 110. Therefore, in all districts, the testing of people has gone up. We have already strengthened the health infrastructure and other things in these areas. We will have to increase the containment zones in these districts. We are confident that it will be brought under control,” said Tope.Maharashtra has been clocking over 2,000 cases for 11 days straight. After clocking over 3,000 cases on May 24, the cases recorded on May 26 and May 27 were relatively lower at 2,091 and 2,190, respectively. However, state health commissioner Anup Kumar Yadav said, “We do not want to read the data [of last few days]. It may be a temporary decrease. We should not be excited if the numbers go up or go down for two days. The lockdown is opening up. There is movement of people, so there could be an increase in the number of cases.”The state government has started a review and planning for further relaxations on curbs from June 1. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday had already hinted restrictions will be eased on a “trial” basis.Senior bureaucrats said that the guidelines for the lifting of curbs are expected by May 30. A senior bureaucrat said that the government is preparing infrastructure to support the increase in cases once restrictions are further relaxed. He said that the government is going to lift lockdown restrictions after May 31 in a “gradual and calibrated manner”, but Covid-19 cases are bound to go up as this happens. “It is obvious that once further relaxation is provided to people, cases would go up. Our top consideration is to look at the extent and acceleration of the spread in the state,” he said.The state government has also made requests to the Centre to start Mumbai suburban train services to ferry essential services staffers in the civic body. If approved by the Centre, the access points of train stations will be manned and only essential services staff will be allowed to travel in locals that will run in the morning and evening.Meanwhile, 698 people recovered on Thursday, taking the tally of recovered patients to 18,616. The recovery rate in the state is 31.26%, while the mortality rate is at 3.32%. Currently, 6,12,745 people are under home quarantine and 35,122 people are in institutional quarantine, the state health department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-598-fresh-infections-take-state-tally-closer-to-60-000/story-lXkS0zsHfvIOIBdrd2q2TN.html
29-05-2020||Mumbai||Airoli school rubbishes parents’ demand for stay on fee hike||Several parents of students at VIBGYOR High School, Airoli have raised concerns over the school’s decision of not revoking a fee hike which it had imposed a few months before the Covid-19 outbreak. In a written plea to the school, around 50 parents have demanded that the fee hike be revoked in the light of the current situation. However, the school has refused to revoke their decision.“The school has hiked fees by 8%-10% for each class which we did not object to earlier. But with the current situation wherein people are losing their jobs and getting pay cuts, many parents are finding it difficult to pay the fees, hence we have asked the school to scrap the hike but there is no response from their end yet,” said a parent of a Class 1 student. In a Government Resolution (GR) released in the first week of May, schools have been asked to stay all fee hikes for the academic year 2020-21 and also allow parents to pay fees in instalments. The GR is applicable for all schools in the state irrespective of the board they are affiliated to. Rustom Kerawalla, chairman of VIBGYOR group of schools, said the school had imposed the hike in February and hence did not revoke it. “As a school, we also have a lot of expenditure to take care of like rent, payments to staff members, maintenance etc. However for parents who cannot pay fees due to genuine reasons, we have introduced a scholarship system. They can apply for it and submit the required documentary proof. Such parents would be given some relaxations in fee payments,” he added. Parents, however, said they wanted the school to revoke the hike for everyone. “If fees cannot be reduced, at least they should not be increased,” said another parent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/airoli-school-rubbishes-parents-demand-for-stay-on-fee-hike/story-fHpLCsaXx3wNixZGplvPjJ.html
29-05-2020||Chandigarh||Vij wants tighter curbs on Delhi border||Following a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the national capital region (NCR) districts of Haryana, home minister Anil Vij on Thursday sought stringency in free movement of people from Delhi.Top officials said that fresh curbs meant that those who don’t have e-movement passes and don’t fall in the approved category of essential service providers as per the directions of the ministry of home affairs will not be allowed to commute from Delhi to Haryana. “Following relaxations in lockdown 4.0, the to and fro movement of people from Delhi to Haryana had increased. There is a possibility that the authorities in the NCR districts have lowered their guard and are allowing unhindered access,’’ said an official who did not wish to be named.The home minister is learnt to have expressed concern at the rising number of cases in the state due to free movement of people from the national capital.The state government had on May 14 given an undertaking before the Delhi High Court that movement of persons from Delhi to Haryana would be allowed on production of e-passes.These movement passes were to be issued to all persons engaged in providing essential services, including medical professionals, within 30 minutes of the receipt of application.Each e-pass is valid for the entire duration of the lockdown and can be used for multiple visits, the state government had told the HC.The state government had taken a stand before the court that since about 56% of the coronavirus cases in the national capital region (NCR) districts — Gurugram, Faridabad, Jhajjar and Sonepat — had Delhi links, it will allow back and forth movement of medical professionals from Delhi only on production of movement passes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vij-wants-tighter-curbs-on-delhi-border/story-7YDuZPZbfl11wpmAgTgwxN.html
29-05-2020||City||‘26/11 witness had recovered well, was home for 12 days’||Harishchandra Shrivardhankar, 68, one of the key witnesses in the 26/11 terror attack case, who helped identify terrorist Ajmal Kasab, suffered a cardiac arrest and died at his house in Kalyan on Tuesday.“His helping nature and concern for others are what we miss when he is no more with us. He had recovered from his illness and was home with us for around 12 days before he died of cardiac arrest,” said his eldest son Mangesh Shrivardhankar, 42.On November 26, 2008, Shrivardhankar was shot twice in the back by Pakistani terrorists Kasab and his accomplice Abu Ismail outside Cama Hospital. According to a 2010 HT report, he went on to become one of the main witnesses who deposed before the special court.HT had reported on May 5 how Shrivardhankar, who was found lying helpless on the footpath near a shop at Saat Rasta in Chinchpokli on April 29, was reunited with his family by the store owner, Dean D’Souza and his friends on May 1.“Our local doctor who checked him said it was a cardiac arrest. We had just bought him home from the hospital on May 15 as doctors said he had recovered. He was also talking properly. We had maintained a proper diet for him,” said Mangesh.“Even after the attack, he resumed his work with the food and civil supplies department and continued for one year till his retirement. He used to talk about the incident to his colleagues a lot. He recollected the attack all the time and that somehow may have affected him mentally,” said Mangesh.When Shrivardhankar was reunited with his family on May 1, his health condition had deteriorated, he had a leg injury and hardly spoke. According to his family, he used to suffer from memory loss and had left home earlier in March. At the time, his family has lodged a missing person complaint at the Khadakpada police station in Kalyan (West).“Like every day he went down to roam in our locality. He used to often meet his friends after retirement. That day he didn’t return and we kept searching. He was a social person who loved helping others, meeting people, and also reach out to those in help,” said Mangesh.After he was found in Chinchpokli and returned home, local corporator Daya Gaikwad helped the family get ₹10 lakh aid for Shrivandhankar’s treatment from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had also visited him at the hospital in Kalyan and announced monetary help from the party.Shrivardhankar is survived by his wife, two sons, and a daughter.“We have received a cheque from the party which is yet to clear. We are grateful to all those who came forward to help us in our difficult times,” said Mangesh. “It gives us immense relief that we could look after him for some days before he left us. During his missing period he suffered a leg injury which was also treated at the hospital,” he added.Gaikwad, who attended his final rites, said, “The monetary help which was announced by the party will be given. They come from a middle-class family and the money will definitely help them. We are glad that at least we could take care of the braveheart for a few days.”Former mayor of Kalyan, Rajendra Deolekar, who also attended the rituals, said, “His nature of helping the others and his bravery will also remain in our hearts. He has set an example for others. Being a common man, he took all the risks and fought for the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/26-11-witness-had-recovered-well-was-home-for-12-days/story-LR3VKm4N9BmyBIKvfO7DyL.html

When we reached there around 5.15pm, a nurse told us that they cannot admit my wife,” said Maulana Sayyad Akbar Mehdi Sahab, 38.Sahab put her in an autorickshaw and went from one hospital to another. “I first took her to Kalsekar Hospital, which refused to admit her saying it is a Covid hospital. I took her to three other private hospitals in Mumbra, but in vain. Her health was deteriorating. Finally, I sought help from a social worker to get her admitted to Kalsekar.”He alleged that Kalsekar hospital staff misbehaved with them. “After much pleading and political pressure, the hospital agreed to admit her. But, she was no more.”Her death certificate says she died of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) with suspected Covid.The couple has a six-year-old son.“Kalsekar Hospital could have at least given her basic treatment. Moreover, my wife died at 7.45pm and they released the body around 2am,” said Sahab.Civic-run Kalwa hospital cannot reject emergency patients. Pratibha Sawant, the hospital dean, said, “I am not aware of the incident. However, if it was a suspected Covid case, we did not have a vacant bed in the isolation ward and we cannot admit a suspected Covid patient in the general ward. The staff might have refused admission.”The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) said they have got many such complaints and have sent show-cause notices to 78 private hospitals in Mumbra, Kausa, Kalwa and Diva.RT Kendre, health officer of TMC, said, “There is no rule which says that an emergency patient cannot be admitted in any of the private hospitals if they have not been tested for Covid. Every hospital is supposed to admit and treat patients. If the private hospitals are at fault, action will be taken.”Kendre said Kalsekar is a Covid hospital and cannot admit suspected or non-Covid patients.Dr Afreen Saudagar, chief executive officer of Kalsekar, said, “The patient came to Kalsekar around 4pm. We could not admit her as this is a Covid hospital and the woman being pregnant could get infected if she was not Covid positive. Our other beds were full. They came back around 7.30pm, but the patient’s health was deteriorating.”Saudagar said there was no pulse, her saturation level was 30% and there was no respiratory rate. “We put her on a ventilator but she died. Her chest X-ray showed signs of Covid infection so we could not release the body without following the protocol,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pregnant-woman-dies-in-mumbra-after-hospitals-refuse-to-admit-her/story-nKhKd40t4WNAnS8kkl4TPL.html

29-05-2020||Mumbai||Hundreds from Maharashtra still stuck in UAE||Despite several flights under the Vande Bharat Mission, hundreds of people from Maharashtra residing in different cities and districts including Mumbai and Pune are stuck in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. While many flights were arranged under Vande Bharat Mission to India from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), several who are still there complain that no flights from UAE are being flown to any airports in Maharashtra except for the flights to Mumbai Airport via Hyderabad flown recently.The majority of flights that have been planned from UAE are for Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. Only a few were planned for Maharashtra, those wanting to return home said. Many have lost their jobs due to the lockdown and are finding it difficult to survive there. Amay Shirke, a resident of Badlapur who works in Dubai, said, “I was working a technician with a private company, but due to a medical emergency I have to be back to India with my parents. There are no flights since the past two months for Mumbai or to any other airports in Maharashtra. I hardly have any money with me now.”Shrike added, “There are flights to Kerala, Telangana and other states, but no flights for going to Maharashtra. I am compelled to take financial help from my family instead of providing them with financial assistance to extended stay here. There could be close to 1,000 here from Maharashtra. I request the government to arrange special flights for us.”Kripa Shah, another Mumbaiite who works in Dubai, said, “I came to UAE on March 16 as I got a job near Dubai. I have a medical emergency and I need to be back to India for the treatment.”An email sent to the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi remained unanswered till the time of going to the press. However, the Embassy in reply to a tweet by those stuck in UAE from Maharashtra said, “We have already taken up the matter regarding special flights to Mumbai and are awaiting approvals.”Sunita Yadav, another resident of Mumbai, said, “I have lost my job almost three months ago, and have no money to survive. I also have an infection on my tooth for which I require treatment, but the treatment here is costly compared to Mumbai, and I cannot afford the same.” Meanwhile, Spruha Gaikar said, “I am 32 weeks pregnant, and want to go to Mumbai for my delivery considering the hospitalisation is very costly here.”In Mumbai, so far, over 2,000 passengers have arrived from international destinations under the mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hundreds-from-maharashtra-still-stuck-in-uae/story-5NCUXBw85SFppMLAGQed4H.html

The rates are reduced from ₹4,500 to ₹3,000 after a meeting held with the lab representatives and the corporation. TMC wanted the rates to decrease to ₹2,000, however, after a day-long meeting the rates were fixed at ₹3,000.On Tuesday, ICMR removed the price cap of ₹4,500 for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test which is used to detect Covid-19. Now, the states have been given a free hand to negotiate with the approved list of laboratories and fix the cost. The decision was taken as testing capacity and infrastructure have improved significantly while the dependence on imported kits has also become negligible because of an increase in domestic production.A TMC official said, “We had send them a letter asking to reduce the rates, however the labs were not ready to reduce the rates. On Thursday a meeting was held with the labs and the labs were also kept shut for the day. We have convinced them to reduce the rates.”Civic commissioner Vijay Singhal has confirmed that the rates have been reduced from ₹4,500 to ₹3,000 for testing in any of the private labs in Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rate-for-covid-test-at-private-labs-reduced/story-FS3aJEjfG2pKBC6uztxxSL.html

In all, 59 Shramik Special trains, bound for various states, departed from different railway stations in the district during their period.Gautam Budh Nagar police commissioner Alok Singh said till Wednesday, 80,200 migrant labourers working in the district have been safely sent to their respective home towns in Bihar, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and eastern Uttar Pradesh. “Besides them, around 20,000 minors have also gone home with their parents and relatives. We ensured their safe departure on 59 trains, bound to different places in these states,” he said. The police chief further said around 25,000 migrant workers, who hailed from Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan and were working in the district, have also been sent by buses to their native places. “We used advanced app-based technology to create a database of these workers and their families. After getting a requisition from them, each one of them was sent messages on their mobile phones confirming them a seat on the train and mentioning the departure station, train name and destination,” he said. Singh also said to ensure that these workers reached stations on time, the administration arranged buses from 12 different locations in Noida and Greater Noida. “One person was assigned to oversee passengers in each train coach and that person had to prepare the full details of passengers in that coach. The database had also been sent to the district administration of the destinations of these trains. It will help them to locate everyone, and track the contact list of any passenger found Covid-19 positive,” he said.He also said before boarding, every passenger was screened and sanitized. “The passengers were also been provided meals and drinking water for their trips. The railways have extended their full support, and will provide additional trains if required,” he said.Singh also said around 16,000 more workers are registered to return to their villages. “But, with the resumption of commercial activities in the district, which have provided many with job opportunities again, most of them are now not willing to go back. This is a good sign from the viewpoint of the economic development of the district, which had come to a standstill for almost two months. We, however, are contacting each of them. If they would like to go, the trains are ready to take them to their desired destinations. One train can cater to around 2,000 passengers,” the police chief said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-sent-over-1-lakh-migrants-home-on-59-trains-in-last-12-days/story-n3Jo2IOt0k9ySjC9NtIacL.html

In Delhi, 2.3% of the active cases are admitted to the intensive care units of the city and 0.36% on ventilators. This is lower than the national average of 3% in intensive and 0.45% on ventilators.“The government is reviewing the admission criteria to ensure that there are beds available for the sick patients,” said a doctor aware of the matter. Delhi recorded 1,024 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday alone.According to the Delhi government’s guidelines, those with mild symptoms like fever and upper respiratory tract infection have to either be in home isolation or be admitted to Covid Care Centres if the former is not possible.Those with moderate symptoms like high-grade fever, respiratory rate between 15 and 30 breaths per minute (normal is between 12 to 20 breaths per minute), or oxygen saturation between 90 and 94% (normal is 95 to 100%) have to be admitted to Covid Health Centres, which have increased monitoring and health care facilities than Care Centres.Those with severe symptoms — respiratory rate higher than 30 and oxygen saturation lower than 90% — have to be admitted to the dedicated hospitals.Of the 8,470 active cases in Delhi, 2,196 are in hospital.“Almost all of our beds are full. Now, when the number of cases go up with the easing of lockdown, we have to start discharging the mild cases to make space for those with severe symptoms,” said Dr Balvinder Singh, medical superintendent of Safdarjung hospital.The designated private hospitals in the city are currently running at around 86% of their capacity on average, whereas government hospitals on average have utilised 61% of their capacity.Around 50% of active cases in Delhi are in home isolation.“We follow the criteria while referring patients to government sector hospitals or Covid Care Centres, but people can choose private hospitals, so even though many might not need admission they can get it,” said a district official, on condition of anonymity.In preparation for a surge in the number of cases, Delhi government has designated 1,500 beds to treat Covid-19 in Guru Teg Bahadur hospital. Another 2,000 paid beds have been added, by asking 117 private hospitals in the city to reserve 20% of its beds for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.“The number of admissions in the city are driven up by people who do not have enough space at homes or live with the old and those with comorbidities and hence request to get admitted in the hospitals. This is mostly because they do not want to go to the government isolation centres for mild cases, hospitals have much better facilities,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta from the department of respiratory medicine at Safdarjung hospital.“If there is a surge in the number of cases — which is now likely to happen — the services at the hospitals have to be optimised to admit only those with severe symptoms and other risk factors who actually need admission. What is happening in Maharashtra now can very well happen in Delhi,” he said.HT had on Monday reported that hospitals in Maharashtra’s capital Mumbai were struggling to cope with the influx of Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cases-on-rise-delhi-govt-reviews-hospital-admission-criteria/story-31wSoqTXRoQxGjbgxjqP2I.html
29-05-2020||Delhi||Covid: As bodies pile up in Delhi, govt allows use of wood for cremation||Beginning Thursday, four crematoriums run by the civic bodies in Delhi have started using wood to dispose of bodies of Covid-19 confirmed and suspected patients, officials confirmed. The move was necessitated because only two of the six CNG-run furnaces were running and bodies of Covid patients were piling up with crematoriums returning them because they were unable to take the load. Using wood for the cremation of bodies of Covid-19 patients was not allowed earlier for the fear of possible spread of the infection. HT had reported on Thursday how with only two CNG furnaces working, bodies were piling at the designated Covid-19 mortuary of the Lok Nayak hospital. Inside the mortuary, there are 108 bodies. All 80 storage racks are full and there are 28 bodies on the floor, piled on top of each other.Officials on Thursday said a third furnace was fixed on Wednesday night. Staff at the Nigambodh Ghat -- a crematorium on the banks of Yamuna -- said it will take them at least two months to repair the other three furnaces.As on Thursday, Delhi had recorded 16,281 Covid-19 cases and 316 deaths; 7,495 persons have been discharged/recovered.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOn Wednesday, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation -- the nodal agency for managing cremations of Covid-19 patients -- directed four crematoriums in Kardardooma, Nigambodh Ghat, Rani Jhansi Road and Punjabi Bagh to use wood for funeral rites.The order marked to the South and the East municipal bodies signed by the North civic body’s health officer, a copy of which HT has seen, said that preference must be given to use of the CNG furnace. At the Rani Jhansi crematorium, which has started taking bodies of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases after the order, the authorities have been strict about the gathering. Until Thursday evening, 15 bodies were cremated using wood. Sultan Singh, the in-charge of the crematorium, said, “We have just started dealing with Covid-19 cases. We allow only one member of the family near the body to light the pyre. Even that one relative has to wear mask and take other precautions. The priests handling such bodies also wear masks and gloves. Nobody opens the body that is wrapped in a personal protective equipment suit. It is directly kept on top of a pile of wood and covered for the final rites. There is no contact with the body. It is a new thing for us. We are following the government’s orders.”Until Wednesday evening, the bodies of Covid-19 patients and suspected Covid-19 patients were being taken to the electric crematoriums at Nigambodh Ghat and Punjabi Bagh. Besides these, the bodies are being sent to four burial grounds in ITO, Mangolpuri, Madanpur Khadar and Shastri Park. Suman Gupta, of the Nigambodh Ghat Sanchalan Samiti, said by Thursday evening, they had cremated 15 bodies using wood and five in the CNG furnace. “We are worried but what can we do if the government refuses to listen. There are rows of bodies cremated through the wood in the open. We are worried about the smoke. It could be dangerous. The lives of our 70 workers and 100 priests are at risk. The cremation in the CNG furnace was controlled and happened in an isolated section. Outsiders were not allowed inside. Now the Covid-19 bodies are being cremated in the open, sometimes side by side too. We are only doing it because of the government’s orders.”Experts said cremating bodies of Covid-19 patients using wood is completely safe.Dr Sudhir Gupta, professor and head of the department of forensic medicine and toxicology, AIIMS, said, “It is perfectly safe to dispose of the body through the wood-based method. The temperature maintained is the same as that of the CNG furnace. One must follow the guidelines that the government has issued such as not coming in contact with the body, wearing masks and gloves. The precautions that one adopts at the CNG furnace must be adopted in the wood-based system too.”The mayor of the North Delhi civic body, Avtar Singh, too said the process is safe and approved by the central government. “Cremating bodies using wood is not harmful. It is being done to clear the backlog and expedite cremations. We adopted the process so that the families of those who died do not have to wait for days for the final rites,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-as-bodies-pile-up-in-delhi-govt-allows-use-of-wood-for-cremation/story-8TfW1Gp9LoGMDgVJhXLZwM.html
29-05-2020||Delhi||NDMC headquarters sealed for 48 hours after 6 test Covid positive in 24 hours||The New Delhi Municipal Council’s (NDMC) headquarters — Palika Kendra, located near Connaught Place — was on Thursday sealed for 48 hours after six people in the building tested positive for Covid-19 in 24 hours. All the staff have been asked to work from home for two days until the building is completely sanitised.According to NDMC official, as many as six employees — including a joint director-level official — have tested Covid-19 positive in the last 24 hours. The administration has ordered a sanitisation drive in the building three times a day and contact tracing of all patients.“On Wednesday, the sixth floor of the building was sealed after three employees tested Covid-19 positive. Later that day, three more staffers tested positive, prompting the decision to seal the headquarter building for 48 hours so that it could be sanitised properly,” a district administration official said.The official said that those who were in close contact with the infected employees have been directed to home quarantine. “The sampling can only be done after they start showing symptoms of Covid. The employees, for now, have been instructed to report to district administration officials in case they show any symptoms,” the administration official said.In the last two months, as many as nine officials and employees of NDMC have tested Covid-19 positive. Last week, the civic body had shut its Palika dispensary — located in the NDMC headquarters — after a doctor working there had tested positive for the virusAccording to NDMC officials, the 21-floor Palika Kendra building houses around 24 departments of the municipality. As many as 3,000 NDMC staff work in the building—including the NDMC chairman and secretary s.“Alternate arrangement has been made to operate the control and command centre from some other place for 48 hours. Security offices and server rooms will be opened on Saturday, while the building will be completely reopened again only on Monday,” an NDMC official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ndmc-headquarters-sealed-for-48-hours-after-2-more-staff-test-covid-positive/story-5IbPq2lPp61x45q4MmkC9I.html
29-05-2020||Delhi||High court asks govt, 3 municipal corps for status of Delhi’s burial grounds||The Delhi high court on Thursday issued notices to the city government and the three municipal corporations directing them to apprise the court of the status of the Capital’s crematoriums and burial grounds of the city. The high court filed a PIL and quoted Hindustan Times’ May 28 report that detailed how all 80 storage racks at Lok Nayak hospital’s Covid-19 mortuary were full and 28 bodies were on the floor. The Court also quoted on how eight bodies were returned from Nigambodh Ghat on Tuesday because the facility was not in a position to accept more bodies, as only two of the three CNG furnaces were working and that bodies of those who had died five days ago were yet to be cremated.The court noted that the state of affairs, if true, was ‘”highly dissatisfactory and violative of the rights of the dead.”“We thus take suo moto cognizance of the aforesaid violations of human rights and by this order bring the same to the notice of the Chief Justice, to take up the aforesaid matter in public interest, for issuing requisite directions,” the court said.The matter will now be heard on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/high-court-asks-govt-3-municipal-corps-for-status-of-delhi-s-burial-grounds/story-ewzrWP77X4H2DVnfLcP7QN.html
29-05-2020||Delhi||In a first, Delhi colour codes its containment zones; to ramp up surveillance, testing||The Delhi government has categorised containment zones in the city into red, orange and green so that regular follow-ups in terms of surveillance, house-to-house health checks and testing continue in a systematic way, said a senior government official.On Thursday, Delhi had 58 containment zones marked red. These are the ones in which Covid cases are surfacing frequently. As many as 36 were marked orange -- areas in which no fresh Covid case has been reported for the last 14 days. And, 49 green zones which used to be containment zones but containment efforts were scaled down after no fresh case was recorded there for 21 days, said a report prepared by the Delhi government which HT has seen.There were 94 containment zones in the city, as on Thursday. Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev said, “It’s a good sign that 85 containment zones in Delhi are today Covid-free or are approaching that stage (classified orange and green), compared to 58 zones that are still marked red. It shows that the strategy of containment zones has proved effective. Concerted action is being taken by the district administrations for ensuring that no more positive cases recur in orange and red zones so that they become green and orange within the prescribed timelines.”While the government had prepared a heatmap of containment zones with the help of Geospatial Delhi Limited (GSDL) – its own subsidiary which applies analytical tools for mapping and data crunching – it prepared its first colour-coded report, on a pilot basis, on Wednesday. It recorded 91 containment zones – 51 Red and 40 Orange. The number of Green zones was 45.Within the next 24 hours, containment efforts were scaled down in four areas but seven areas were notified as new containment zones. So, the total number increased by three, government records showed.A senior government official said with Thursday’s assessment of the zones being done, the district magistrates have been directed to further streamline their efforts from Friday under the SHIELD initiative to ensure the reds change into oranges and the oranges change into green at the earliest. “The initiative has been immensely effective and the numbers show the results,” the official added.The SHIELD initiative of the Delhi government translates to the sealing of the area, home quarantine of all residents, isolation and tracing of contacts, essentials to be supplied at doorstep, local sanitisation and door-to-door health checks.The issue of nomenclature Initially, there was confusion regarding nomenclature. The central government had the sole authority to categorise red, orange and green zones across states. Under the central guidelines, all revenue districts in Delhi were marked red, leading to limited relaxations that could be implemented across the city-state in terms of business and commerce activities and public transport during the lockdown.Within Delhi, however, the city government used the nomenclature red zone for all containment zones and there were no orange or green zones as such. With the onset of the fourth phase of the nationwide lockdown on May 18, the union government allowed the state governments to determine red, orange and green zones on their own.On May 20, following a meeting between Delhi’s lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal the Delhi government had issued directions to the health department to come up with a plan on red, range and green zones.Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital said, “After such categorisation, the government must ensure that surveillance teams continue to be active for all three categories of containment zones and that there are medical teams to guide them. They can consider using trained volunteers from within communities to monitor the efficiency of the surveillance and testing mechanism. And rapid action teams should continue to be active in data collection of contact tracing and surveillance, their analysis and interpretation, and guide the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-a-first-delhi-colour-codes-its-containment-zones-to-ramp-up-surveillance-testing/story-r55KDalct9fGHjxw0tnjGM.html
29-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police file 12 more charge sheets against foreigners in Jamaat case||Delhi Police on Thursday filed 12 charge sheets against 541 foreign members of the Tablighi Jamaat who attended a congregation organised by the Islamic missionary group at its Nizamuddin headquarters in March. This is the third consecutive day charge sheets have been filed against foreigners in the case for violating visa conditions and Covid-19 lockdown rules, taking the total number indicted to 915. The charge sheets filed on Thursday against foreigners from three countries ran into more than 12,000 pages, and were submitted before the duty magistrate in the Saket court. In the same case, between Tuesday and Wednesday, 35 charge sheets were filed in the same court against 374 foreigners belonging to 34 different countries. The court is to decide on the cognisance of the charge sheets on June 25. The 47 charge sheets filed in the three days run into 40,908 pages.The 915 foreigners have all been booked under Section 14 (b) of the Foreigners Act, Section 3 of the Epidemic Disease Act, Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act and four sections (188, 269, 270 and 271) of the Indian Penal Code for violating visa conditions, lockdown rules, spreading the virus, and breaking quarantine rules, the police said.“The Central government has already blacklisted them and cancelled their visas, as all of them arrived in India on tourist visas but indulged in missionary activities , which is illegal and against the visa manuals,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Mandeep Singh Randhawa.Randhawa said of the 541 foreigners charge-sheeted on Thursday, 414 are from Indonesia, 85 from Kyrgyzstan and 42 belong to Malaysia.The crime branch had filed a criminal case against Tablighi Jamaat chief Maulana Saad and six other top officials of the organisation on March 31 for defying a series of government directives, which curbed religious and large gatherings to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the national capital.More than 2,300 people, including foreigners, were evacuated from the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in March-end and lodged in quarantine facilities in Delhi by the authorities. The headquarters, known as the Markaz, went on to emerge as the biggest Covid-19 cluster in India, leading to a spurt in the rate of infection in the city.A total of 943 foreigners who had attended the religious congregation organised at the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters have been questioned in the case. While the passports of 723 foreigners and identity cards of 23 Nepal nationals have been recovered, the investigating team set yet to get the travel documents of 197 foreigners.“A majority from the 197 foreigners claim that their passports are with the officer bearers of the Tablighi Jamaat or at its headquarters. Our team had searched the headquarter but did not find them. The investigators would obtain details of their visa and passport from the immigration bureau, if the documents are not recovered,” said a senior crime branch officer privy to the probe, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-police-file-12-more-charge-sheets-against-foreigners-in-jamaat-case/story-ATwBMRirLEiqFTSqTYLzvL.html
29-05-2020||Education||DU Admissions 2020: University may start registrations from June 8, admission process to be completely online||The Delhi University (DU) is likely to begin its admission process for undergraduate, postgraduate, MPhil, and PhD courses by June 8, according to a tentative schedule shared by the administration with the standing committee of the academic council, the highest decision-making body of the varsity, on Wednesday.While the registration process for admission in these courses is tentatively scheduled between June 8 and June 30, admissions for the first cut-off list for undergraduate courses is likely between August 11 and August 14.However, DU officials said, the schedule will entirely depend on the declaration of CBSE Class 12 results and the Covid-19 situation at that time. The standing committee will hold a meeting on Friday to approve the tentative schedule. The pending CBSE board exams are scheduled to be conducted between July 1 and July 15. Although the board has not announced the dates for the results, they are likely to be declared by the end of July.The DU admission process has been delayed by over two months this year due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Last year, the registration process had begun on May 30 and the first cut-off was announced on June 27.According to the tentative schedule for the session 2020-21, the online registration portal for admission to undergraduate courses will be re-opened for updating the class 12 marks between July 31 and August 9.Shobha Bagai, the head of the university’s admission department, said that the entire process will be online this year. “The admission process will be completely administered through the university’s online admission portal. There is no offline admission for any applicant. The students will not be called immediately to the colleges for the physical verification of certificates and completion of the admission process, like before. The colleges will verify the documents online to complete the admission process to avoid gathering of students in view of the Covid-19 pandemic,” she said, adding that the physical verification of documents will be done whenever the classes begin. Bagai, however, said that a final decision on dates and other modalities will be taken after discussing with all the statutory bodies of the university.The admission against the first cut-off is likely to be conducted between August 11 and August 14 and under the second cut-off between August 18 and August 20. While the tentative schedule mentions that five cut-off lists will be announced this year, there is likely to be a special cut-off under which admission will be held between September 8 and September 9. ‘“In case seats are left vacant, further cut-offs may be announced by the university . The schedule will depend on the declaration of class 12 result by CBSE. The dates may be modified keeping in view the situation at the time of admission due to the COVID-19,” the document mentioning the tentative schedule read.For the 12 entrance-based undergraduate courses, the entrance exam will tentatively be held between July 27 and August 10. These courses include BA (Hon) in Business Economics, Bachelor of Management Studies, Bachelor of Business administration, Bachelor of Elementary Education, and BA (Hon) in Multimedia and Mass Communication, among others. Similarly, the entrance exams for postgraduate courses — M Phil and PhD — will also likely be held at the same time.The university, however, has mentioned in its draft bulletin that the modalities of the entrance exams will be announced in the coming weeks by the National Test Agency — the nodal agency .In Delhi University, candidates apply for admissions by creating an account on the university’s online portal. The portal will be available on DU’s official website (du.ac.in). The candidates will upload their details, mark sheets and certificates on the portal and apply for courses and complete the process by paying the registration fee. On the declaration of the cut-off list, the applicants can log-in to the portal to check which all colleges and courses they are eligible for.For the first time, this year, the candidates will not be asked to visit the colleges to complete the admission process. “The colleges shall verify the documents uploaded by the applicants for eligibility and required cut-off. The course in-charge will verify the minimum required qualification, convener of admission will recheck and approve or decline the admissions and then principals will give the final approval or rejection,” stated the draft of the admission bulletin shared with the standing members.“Once the principal of the college has approved admissions, the applicant will receive a link on their dashboard on the portal through which they can submit their college fees. The fees will be paid within 24 hours of the approval of admission failing which the admission will be automatically cancelled,” it added.Several faculty members, however, have raised objections over the shifting of the entire admission process online. Rajesh Jha, the member of the University’s executive council, said, “It should be ensured that all the eligible and interested students should not face difficulties in the admission process. We cannot forget that a large section of students applying for DU are from economically weaker groups. They do not have access to devices and the internet.”The University is yet to decide on modalities to be followed for admission under the sports and extracurricular activities (ECA) quota amid the COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-may-start-registrations-from-june-8-admission-process-to-be-completely-online/story-gVpPRgG8HCvbWC0tq9iF7O.html
29-05-2020||Mumbai||96% of containment zones in Mumbai are in slums, chawls||With 659 of the 684 containment zones in the city in slums and chawls, these densely populated areas and small tenements, which house a population of 35 lakh, will be crucial to Mumbai’s fight against Covid-19.As per the Union health ministry, a containment zone is defined as a geographical area where a significant number of positive cases of coronavirus are found. Strict movement restrictions are put in place in such areas to prevent the spread of the virus. These zones are created by geographically demarcating 3-km radius from the residence of the positive case. Initially, the BMC contained single buildings, but now the BMC uses natural boundaries such as roads, nullahs, chowks to seal the zones. Zones can be made of a few buildings with cases, a square or an area that is easy to lock in. Restrictions are removed if no new case is found in 28 days. Overall, 7,79,740 households and 35,93,384 people in Mumbai are under containment zones.Also Read: Another constable succumbs to Covid; Mumbai Police toll is 14Dharavi, the biggest slum cluster in Mumbai, has 11 containment zones, housing a population of 1.98 lakh. The Dharavi slum is spread over 2.4 sqkm, has 8,50,000 population and a population density of 354,167 per square kilometre, making it one of the more cramped spaces in Mumbai, itself the world’s fifth most densely populated city. The slum is characterised by difficult-to-manage makeshift shanties, or double storey stand-alone tin and concrete shanties. There are only a few multi-storey slum rehabilitation authority (SRA) buildings that are gated. There are 225 public community toilets in this slum, used by thousands of people daily. Residents are daily wage workers, or run small businesses from their homes. By some estimates, there are thousands of businesses in the shantytown.Of the 684, slum pockets in L ward of BMC (Kurla) have the highest number of containment zones (131) covering 10,699 households and a population of 53,451. Kurla is followed by slum pockets in Govandi (M-East ward) and Bhandup (S ward).Also Read: Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThere are 66 containment zones in Govandi which includes 54,533 households and 2.91 lakh people. In Bhandup, 84,772 people are contained in 62 zones, which include 18,979 households.Small houses, common toilets and high population density lead to faster spread in slums and chawls, say civic officials. Home quarantining a positive patient is practically difficult in such localities owing to lack of space.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (who is in charge of health), said: “Most of the containment zones are in densely populated slums and chawls. It is because social distancing is difficult in such localities. As such, there will be restrictions. No person will be allowed to go out of the containment zone and no outsider will be allowed entry. The civic body is ensuring supply of essential commodities such as food and vegetables inside containment zones.”Also Read: Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakDr Prakash Rokade, independent health expert and epidemiologist, said, “Despite a majority of slum areas being marked as containment zones, the cases are rising daily. Demarcation is not the only solution. Institutional quarantine is important for these people.”Civic officials say BMC has hired 42,000 hotel and lodge rooms across Mumbai, especially to quarantine slum dwellers from areas where home quarantine is not possible. In some areas, temporary quarantine facilities have been set up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/96-of-containment-zones-in-mumbai-are-in-slums-chawls/story-K82DeK0wjnTJV7VjWdpQGP.html
29-05-2020||Delhi||Traders seek curfew extension, end to odd-even system from June 1||Around 100 trader associations of Delhi, in an online meet, sought an end to the odd-even arrangement for opening shops and an extension in curfew timings from June 1, when the fourth phase of lockdown ends.The associations, including retailers and wholesalers, suggested the relaxations during an online meeting organised by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP’s) trade and industry wing on Thursday. Based on the suggestions, the trade wing will send recommendations to the Delhi government for framing guidelines from June 1.“We had representatives from at least 100 market associations for the meeting, where most suggested that the timing of the curfew be extended beyond 7pm as well as that shops be allowed to open at least six days a week. Traders, mainly in retail, have been affected because of low sales. We will be sending the recommendations to the chief minister and deputy chief minister for consideration before the new set of guidelines is issued post-May 31,” said Brajesh Goyal, convenor, AAP’s trade and industry wing.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAs part of Delhi-specific guidelines for lockdown 4.0 until May 31, the Delhi government had devised the odd-even system for opening of shops in markets on alternate days. The strategy was aimed at limiting the number of people in the markets and to maintain social distancing to stop the spread of Covid-19. The move was based on the Delhi government’s road rationing scheme to reduce pollution in winter.Shops are required to shut by 7pm due to the night curfew from 7pm to 7am.According to trader associations, there were more losses in opening shops based on the odd-even system, as they have to pay rent for the entire month while the sales did not pick up due to few customers.Atul Bhargava, a store owner at Connaught Place and the president of New Delhi Traders’ Association, said, “The odd-even system is not working well for retail markets, where the business is based solely on walk-in customers. We are spending more than what we are earning. The sales are not even enough to meet basic expenses like electricity bills. Besides, there has been no relief from the government in property tax or GST rates. There has to be continuity in the opening of the markets for business to pick up.”Also, retailers have suggested extending the curfew timing, from 7pm to at least 9pm, citing increased customer footfall in evenings due to summer. Since workers come from far-off areas and with limited transport available, they are not able to stay beyond 5pm, which is when customers start pouring in.“Markets must be allowed to open every day. We could open late in the morning, as customers come only later in the day and keep open till 8.30pm or so. The curfew can start from 9pm to 6am, which will be feasible for both traders and customers,” said Sanjeev Mehra, president, Khan Market Traders’ Association.Traders in major markets including Lajpat Nagar, South Extension, Khan Market, Greater Kailash and Sarojini Nagar, as well as wholesale markets like Chandni Chowk, said that staggered timings for opening markets could be a better option than the odd-even system.Sanjay Bhargava, president, Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said that they are ready to open shops from June 1. The traders here had voluntarily decided to shut the market till May 31.“Instead of odd-even, the government must go for staggered timings for wholesale and retail markets. The wholesale markets could open in the first half while retail could open later in the day and remain open till around 8pm. This will help maintain social distancing and order in the markets,” said Bhargava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/traders-seek-curfew-extension-end-to-odd-even-system-from-june-1/story-4jM4Lf8uxuachQTm6HUVnJ.html
29-05-2020||Delhi||Railway station becomes temporary home for many||Standing in a queue outside the ticket booking counter at the New Delhi Railway Station for nearly three hours, Mithun Chaudhary and Mohammad Sanaullah have different expectations when they make it to the front of the line. While Chaudhary is desperate to get a train ticket to his hometown in Bihar, Sanaullah wants a refund on a ticket for a train that was cancelled.Both of them are finding it difficult to survive in the city and are unsure if their long wait in the queue will be fruitful.It is Sanaullah’s third visit to the counter in three days—to seek a refund on a ticket he had booked for a train to Kolkata that got cancelled. “The last two times when my turn arrived, I was told that there was no cash at the counter. The ₹1,800 cash will help me feed my family for a few more days,” Sanaullah, who worked at a bag manufacturing unit, said.Chaudhary is a street food vendor who wants to return to his hometown in Bihar since he hasn’t been able to earn anything during the lockdown. “I brought the last of my savings with me to book a ticket, but there are no confirmed seats till June 21,” Chaudhary said.Ever since May 22, when the railways allowed the resumption of physical ticket booking at some counters in the city, several people have been facing the same issues Chaudhary and Sanaullah have at the ticket booking centre at the New Delhi railway station.The tickets that are being booked at the counters are for journeys beginning June 1—when 100 pairs of trains will begin service from Delhi stations. People can cancel all tickets booked before and during the lockdown.STAYING PUT OUTSIDE THE STATIONWhile those seeking refunds have been returning to the booking centre day after day because of the absence of cash at the counters, many of those with confirmed tickets have been living outside the station itself—under trees along the footpath.Vijay Vishwakarma, a factory worker from Mangolpuri who was allegedly kicked out of his home for not paying rent, landed at the railway station on Wednesday. “I thought I would immediately find a train to Pratapgarh, but the ticket is for June 2. My wife and I plan to stay here till then since we don’t have a home anymore,” Vishwakarma said.Also read: After several deaths in Shramik trains, railways says most died of existing illnessMany people seeking train tickets have arrived with all their luggage and plan to wait around even if it takes days. “We couldn’t find a place on the Shramik trains. But my friends and I are wait-listed on a train to Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh on June 5. If we go back to Narela, we could get stuck there. So, we will spend our time under a tree the next few days,” Kuldeep Singh, a factory worker, said.Deepak Kumar, the chief spokesperson of Northern Railways, said that the rush is likely to slow in June. “Most people are waiting for trains to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Once we begin the additional 100 pairs of trains, much of the rush will clear and people are likely to get confirmed seats,” Kumar said.NO CASH FOR REFUNDSBut the queues at the booking counter are leading to more people cancelling tickets than booking them. And that, Kumar said, is leading to people not getting their refunds.For many, the refund amount is substantial and their key to survival for the next few days. “I had bought tickets worth ₹1,600 before the lockdown. If I get that money back, it will help me survive for at least two more weeks,” Mohammad Dilshad said on Thursday, during his fourth attempt in four days to get a refund.“Each time they asked me to return the next day,” he said.The railway spokesperson acknowledged the problem of shortage of cash and said the problem was on its way to being solved. “Whatever money is received in train bookings is used to issue refunds. But because of the lockdown, people are booking tickets online. That has led to a shortage of cash at some counters,” Kumar said.Now, money is being withdrawn from banks and sent to the booking counters to issue a refund. “In the past 4-4 days, bank holidays and the weekend added to the problem. Now that is getting sorted out,” Kumar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/wait-for-a-train-wait-for-a-refund/story-S6JqOxP3oCnEKFyUXLOHTJ.html
29-05-2020||Other||IOA row escalates, executive committee meeting on cards||The tussle in the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has snowballed leading to members on Thursday calling for an urgent executive committee meeting in June.IOA president Narinder Batra’s decision to disband and re-appoint bodies, including the Ethics Commission on May 19, has been termed ‘unconstitutional’ by some members including secretary-general Rajeev Mehta and treasurer Anandeshwar Pandey. The controversy started one week ago with Batra and Mehta at loggerheads over the latter’s role and responsibility.On Thursday, Pandey wrote to IOA members saying an executive committee (EC) meeting “should be convened in June without any further delay.”“In our lifetime we have not experienced such a challenge and also in my period of 40 years association with IOA, I have not seen such violation of constitution and spirit of trust and goodwill.”“The various letters of president are only proposals to be considered by the EC. Any action of new committee/commission prior to the EC meeting will be violation of IOA constitution and financial proprietary,” Pandey wrote.He said appointing new committees and commissions will have significant impact on expenditure of IOA and will first have to be approved by the EC.“While constitution gives certain powers to both the president and secretary general, powers relating to financial responsibility vest with me. IOA has to incur all expenditure as per approved budget and all income has to be duly accounted for under my signature,” he said.Batra said under the IOA constitution he has the authority to appoint or remove members of a commission.“I do not find any mention in Rule 18.3 of involvement of Secretary General and/or the President is bound to take advice from Secretary General to form any Committee/Commission,” said Batra.IOA secretary-general Mehta also supported the call for an EC meeting. He said the EC meeting should not be online but by maintaining physical distancing. “People with valid voting rights would only be allowed to attend,” said Mehta.“The situation is quite embarrassing for the IOA and things should be sorted out amicably,” he said on Thursday.Mehta said there is a ‘serious conspiracy’ to damage IOA’s financial strength. “If this isn’t stopped soon, it will have a serious impact of IOA financial strength.”Mehta said the constitution of IOA has defined every individual’s responsibilities clearly. “Everything is fixed in our constitution and nobody is allowed to interfere in other’s work, but here some people want to grab powers. It should be stopped immediately. In fact, I am not in favour of breaking the norms of the IOA and I wish to work together.”In a fresh exchange of e-mails on Thursday, Batra sought an explanation from finance committee chairman Anil Khanna on losses incurred due to delay in hotel bookings for the Tokyo Olympics.“IOA has now incurred a loss of Rs 72,84,600 due to the delay at your end as Chair of finance committee or by the entire Finance Committee. I request for a factual position on the above at the earliest,” he said.Mehta said there was no financial loss to the IOA and it is entitled to a refund from the hotel.“The Games have been postponed and we have a foolproof payment system in the IOA. There is no chance of any laxity and the people handling the issue have high reputation and credentials. So doubting their integrity wouldn’t be right. IOA hasn’t lost any money and we have the right to take the money back.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/other-sports/ioa-row-escalates-executive-committee-meeting-on-cards/story-1Y6o35jmrLtSZDBPt87IAN.html
29-05-2020||Gurugram||Curbs at Gurugram-Delhi borders to be tightened||Following a sharp spurt in Covid-19 cases in Haryana’s districts — Gurugram and Faridabad — that border Delhi, the Haryana government has decided to impose strict curbs at inter-state borders with Delhi. The police had relaxed the restrictions at Delhi-Gurugram borders earlier this week due to traffic congestion during the peak rush hours.“As the cases are rising in Delhi, it is a cause for concern for Haryana districts that are bordering Delhi. I have again issued orders today that there should be no leniency on borders between Delhi and Haryana districts. Eighty per cent of coronavirus cases in Haryana are from the districts adjoining Delhi. So, we will keep our borders with Delhi completely sealed,” said home minister Anil Vij to ANI.Muhammad Akil, police commissioner, Gurugram, however, said that they are yet to receive a new order in this regard. “The situation is same at the borders and changes are likely to take place from Saturday morning,” he said. Vij, who also has the health portfolio, on Thursday, wrote to the additional chief secretary, home department, stating that sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in Haryana was taking place due to large scale movement of people between the two states. Taking this into account, borders curbs are likely to continue.Referring to the rise in cases, Vij said in his letter that in the last week, Faridabad has reported 98 cases, Gurugram 111 cases, Jhajjar six and Sonipat 28. In view of the rising cases, it is pertinent that only those categories of people who are allowed by the high court and home ministry be allowed movement between the two states. Haryana on Thursday reported 123 new coronavirus cases, taking the total number of cases in the state to 1,504 including 19 deaths. Gurugram reported the highest single-day spike, recording 68 cases of coronavirus, taking the number of total cases to 405, including three deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/curbs-at-gurugram-delhi-borders-to-continue/story-SkA9Bsism6tOVZDDQZxWCN.html

APMC will ensure that all the necessary precautions are followed at the Market Yard.” APMC had shut down Market Yard after Covid-19 (coronavirus) positive cases were reported from the area. However, sub-markets at Manjri and Pimpri were open for business to ensure smooth vegetable supply to the city.“Number of vehicles entering the wholesale market will be limited and people from micro-containment zones will not be inside the Market Yard,” added Deshmukh.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and cooperative and marketing minister Balasaheb Patil had instructed the administration to restart the market so that farmers from rural areas can bring their produce to the market for sale to residents and maintain ample supply of fruits and vegetables in the city.Traders union president Vilas Bhujbal said, “We will ensure that everyone follows necessary precautions when the Market Yard resumes operations. Everyone coming to the market will need to wear a mask and use sanitisers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/gultekadi-market-yard-to-reopen-on-sunday-after-being-shut-for-50-days/story-nPFoCqfbsmKAF8JdvexLbP.html
29-05-2020||Pune||Covid test: Pune civic body follows ICMR not state guidelines for pregnant women||Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has asked private hospitals not to make Covid-19 (coronavirus) test mandatory for patients undergoing emergency surgeries, including deliveries.According to municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, some private hospitals are subjecting patients to Covid test before emergency surgeries. “Hospitals could be doing it for health reasons as doctors and nursing staff are at high risk of getting infected, but Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) test protocol clearly states no test is required,” said Gaikwad. As per the state government order, which Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is following, all pregnant women from containment areas, including asymptomatic ones likely to deliver in the next five days, should be tested.PMC, however, has yet to take a call on this, said Gaikwad. As per the most recent testing protocol issued by ICMR on May 18, emergency procedure should not be delayed for asymptomatic patients in the absence of Covid test.“No emergency procedures, including deliveries, should be delayed for lack of test,” reads clause number nine of ICMR protocol. The clause further states that sample can be sent for testing in case patient has Covid symptoms.“We have already started implementing this protocol in Pune and have informed private hospitals,” said Gaikwad.Dr Sanjeev Wavare, PMC assistant health chief, said, “The guidelines include testing of all symptomatic individuals with international travel history in last 14 days. We are testing as per the guidelines sent to us by ICMR on May 18 and there are no changes in it. The guidelines include testing of all symptomatic individuals with international travel history in last 14 days, and symptomatic health care workers and contacts of laboratory confirmed cases should be tested. All patients of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), all symptomatic people within hotspots and containment zones and hospitalised patients who develop symptoms should be tested. And no emergency procedures, including deliveries, should be delayed for lack of test.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-test-pmc-follows-icmr-not-state-guidelines-for-pregnant-women/story-PR0MsROSrQ3iDhBCubYM9I.html
29-05-2020||City||Residents of Ludhiana’s Ward 91 protest as water supply remains disrupted||Irked over disruption in water supply, residents of Civil City, Bishan Enclave and Preetam Nagar of Ward Number 91, staged a protest against the area councillor and the municipal corporation. Residents say they have not had supply for the last three days. Kishan Kumar, a resident of Civil City area, said, “When we don’t have water to drink, how does the administration expect us to maintain basic hygiene during the pandemic. We are not being provided water tankers and are forced to ask for water from neighbours who have submersible water pumps.” Keemti Rawal, president of Baba Deep Singh Ji Welfare Society, an NGO, said, “This area faces this problem every year and we have apprised the MC commissioner about it but nothing has been done. We have even written to the Punjab Human Rights Commission.”Area councillor Gurpinder Kaur Sandhu said, “The tube well in the area had developed a snag around six months back. Since then, the supply is being done through tube wells installed in nearby areas. The tube well installation project for Civil City Area has already been but the process got delayed due to the lockdown. The contract would be allotted in few days.” Residents of Gurmail Nagar and areas surrounding Ward 31 also said they are facing water woes. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said,”I have directed the officials of operations of maintenance cell to resolve issue and also ensure supply through water tanks in affected areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-of-ludhiana-s-ward-91-protest-as-water-supply-remains-disrupted/story-ENMtS1QdcygOiuTftKUXkJ.html
29-05-2020||Mumbai||No locust swarm heading for Mumbai; experts rubbish theories||The Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), which functions under the Union agriculture ministry, clarified on Thursday that there is no swarm of insects heading to Mumbai. Unverified photographs on social media had led to panic among Mumbaiites that a locust swarm from Gujarat was expected in Mumbai on Thursday. “The invasion is restricted to parts of eastern Maharashtra, with districts in Vidarbha affected. The wind direction from Madhya Pradesh is favourable for their movement within this area and food availability in these zones. No such warning has been given for the Konkan region, including Mumbai, as the wind direction will not allow their movement to the coastal city from Gujarat,” said KL Gurjar, deputy director, LWO. Experts, too, dissed the reports of locusts swarming the city. Entomologists said locust swarms prefer dry places and would avoid areas such as Mumbai that have excess humidity. “Since 1pm on Thursday, I have been getting messages, images and videos of some grasshopper species from several locations in Mumbai. Many seemed fake or photoshopped,” said Sunjoy Monga, ornithologist and naturalist. “On an ecological level, although not entirely impossible, it is highly unlikely for desert locusts to swarm humid zones.”Dr Himmat Singh, an entomologist from Rajasthan studying locusts extensively, said, “People should not panic as locusts are not a threat to humans. Also, considering large green patches over Vidarbha, where it rained during March and April, makes for a suitable habitat for them to feed on fruit trees. This is not the case in Mumbai and considering the present wind direction, it is highly unlikely that a swarm could enter the city,” he said.Unverified videos on social media platforms made the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) insecticide department call up ward officers across the city to verify whether they had received any complaints. “Not a single complaint was recorded. We found that all videos being claimed to be from Mumbai were fake. The current wind direction over the city will not allow the pests to move over this region, and in case there was such a movement, districts further north of the city would be alerted first,” said Rajan Naringrekar, BMC insecticide officer. “Action needs to be taken against those making such false claims and the police needs to look into this at the earliest,” he added. Dr Kailas Shinde, Palghar district collector, issued an advisory to villages bordering Palghar and Gujarat on locust swarms having reached some parts of the state. The collector advised farmers to keep a vigil in their fields at night. He also asked them to burn tyres and dig trenches to prevent the locusts from damaging the crops.Meanwhile, at Temani village in Bhandara district, two fire tenders carried out a spraying operation across a radius of a kilometre between Wednesday night and Thursday morning. “In the morning the locusts were found falling from trees and dying in large numbers. Tree species on which they rested were mango, teak, moha, anjan, jambhul, kinhi, ber etc, with mango trees affected the most. However, no damage has been recorded across paddy fields where harvesting is underway during early mornings,” said Ravindra Bhosale, divisional joint director agriculture.“While thousands of locusts were killed, those that survived are moving towards Gondia district, which might be the state’s fifth district (after Amravati, Nagpur, Wardha, and Bhandara) to be affected. We are still monitoring their movement,” he added. The state agriculture department on Thursday said there was no indication of locust movement towards Mumbai. “We are constantly getting updates from the LWO and no such warning or alert has been issued for Mumbai,” said Suhas Diwase, agriculture commissioner, Maharashtra. The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) aerodrome meteorological division in Santacruz (for civil aviation services) said there was no difference in visibility on Thursday. “If there was a large locust swarm, it would have been spotted by us,” said Sunil Kamble, scientist, IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-locust-swarm-heading-for-mumbai-experts-rubbish-theories/story-BiyvToqPJ4eMEaBlXhzg7J.html

29-05-2020||Pune||State government approves PMC medical college plan||Given the current Covid-19 pandemic, a proposal by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to set up a medical college on the premises of Naidu hospital, has been approved by the state government.The order for the same was issued on May 26.In August 2019, the PMC standing committee approved the proposal to set up a trust to run the civic medical college at Rs 622 crore. The proposed college will be set up on a 10 acre plot and will be named after late prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said officials.According to mayor Murlidhar Mohol, after the nod from the state government to form the medical education trust in order to establish the proposed medical college, the PMC now will register a trust with charitable commissioner and later submit the proposal for Maharashtra University of Health Science located at Nashik for final approval.“We are expecting that medical college would begin operations from the next academic year. The PMC-run Naidu hospital will be attached with the new medical college. I was following up with the state government and guardian minister Ajit Pawar regarding the proposal,” said Mohol.“We were under impression that the state government may delay the proposal given that the hospital will be named after Vajpayee. However, Pawar made it clear that the name of the college was not an issue; his main concern was that the financial burden must not come on the state government.Development secretary Mahesh Pathak suggested that instead of forming a trust, either PMC or state government should run this college, however, we convinced him and he gave his approval for forming the trust,” added Mohol.The medical trust, according to civic officials, will be an independent body that will run the college through fees from students and nominal charges from patients.According to Mohol, Pathak was in the city recently to take the review of Covid-19 and visited some of the containment zones. During the same visit, Pathak had a detailed discussion over the medical college proposal and assured to approve the PMC proposal.PMC health chief Ramchandra Hankare said, “PMC has received the nod from the state government for forming the trust which will take care of the medical college. Now the PMC will complete the necessary process for it. State government has given the nod by considering that there would be no financial burden on them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/state-government-approves-pmc-medical-college-plan/story-VUetqPsmTpSqhVkEUr1CiP.html
29-05-2020||Chandigarh||Six new Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh’s Bapu Dham Colony, 91-year-old from Sector 15 also positive||Seven new cases of Covid-19 surfaced on Thursday, increasing the city count to 289.Out of the seven cases, six are from the containment zone of Bapu Dham Colony, while a Sector 15 woman was also confirmed infected.The city currently has 96 active cases, while 189 have been discharged. Four people have succumbed to the virus.With Thursday’s new cases, the Covid count in the congested Bapu Dham has now reached 216, accounting for 74% of the city’s cases. The fresh cases comprise four males aged eight, 16, 17 and 53, and two girls aged 12 and 15. The patients are from two households in one building.The first case in Bapu Dham was reported on April 24 when a hospital staffer of Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, and resident of the colony was found infected. The colony has seen one Covid-19 death. ELDERLY WOMAN WAS TO UNDERGO SURGERY The Sector 15 resident is a 91-year-old woman, who was admitted to a private hospital in Mohali for a surgery, and tested positive for the virus before it.“The woman had suffered a fracture in the neck of the femur.

29-05-2020||World||Minneapolis cop who knelt on handcuffed George Floyd arrested||The police officer seen on video kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died in custody after pleading that he could not breathe, was arrested Friday after three days of often-violent protests that resulted in fires and looting across parts of Minneapolis.Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said state investigators arrested Derek Chauvin, who was one of four officers fired this week, but he did not provide details. The state attorney who would oversee any prosecution on state charges, whose home was also the site of protests, was scheduled to provide an update later Friday.News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to this week’s protests and called for swift justice for officers involved. Walz said the state would take over the response to the protests and that it’s time to show respect and dignity to those who are suffering.“Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said, adding. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.”The governor cited a call he received from a state senator who described her district “on fire, no police, no firefighters, no social control, constituents locked in houses wondering what they were going to do. That is an abject failure that cannot happen.”His comments came the morning after protesters torched a police station that officers abandoned during a third night of violence. Livestream video showed protesters entering the building, where intentionally set fires activated smoke alarms and sprinklers. President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.”The governor faced tough questions after National Guard leader Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen blamed a lack of clarity about the Guard’s mission for a slow response. Walz said the state was in a supporting role and that it was up to city leaders to run the situation. Walz said it became apparent as the 3rd Precinct was lost that the state had to step in, which happened at 12:05 a.m. Requests from the cities for resources “never came,” he said.“You will not see that tonight, there will be no lack of leadership,” Walz said.On Friday morning, nearly every building in the shopping district around the abandoned police station had been vandalized, burned or looted. National Guard members were in the area, with several of them lined up, keeping people away from the police station.Dozens of volunteers swept up broken glass in the street, doing what they could to help.Dean Hanson, 64, lives in a subsidized housing unit nearby, which is home to many older residents. He said his building lost electricity overnight, and residents were terrified as they watched mobs of people run around their neighborhood, with no apparent intervention.“I can’t believe this is happening here,” he said.Dozens of fires were also set in nearby St. Paul, where nearly 200 businesses were damaged or looted. Protests spread across the U.S., fueled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver.Trump threatened to bring Minneapolis “under control,” calling the protesters “thugs” and tweeting that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” The tweet drew another warning from Twitter, which said the comment violated the platform’s rules, but the company did not remove it.Trump also blasted the “total lack of leadership” in Minneapolis.A visibly tired and frustrated Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey made his first public appearance of the night early Friday at City Hall and took responsibility for evacuating the precinct, saying it had become too dangerous for officers. As Frey continued, a reporter cut across loudly with a question: “What’s the plan here?”“With regard to?” Frey responded. Then he added: “There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that ... What we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights here in terms of looting is unacceptable.”He defended the city’s lack of engagement with looters — only a handful of arrests across the first two nights of violence — and said, “We are doing absolutely everything that we can to keep the peace.” He said National Guard members were stationed in locations to help stem looting, including at banks, grocery stores and pharmacies.The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN television crew early Friday as the journalists reported on the unrest. While live on air, CNN reporter Omar Jimenez was handcuffed and led away. A producer and a photojournalist for CNN were also taken away in handcuffs.The Minnesota State Patrol said the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order,” and they were released after being confirmed to be media members. CNN said on Twitter that the arrests were “a clear violation of their First Amendment rights.” Walz publicly apologized on Friday.Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. In the footage, Floyd can be seen pleading as officer Derek Chauvin presses his knee against him. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving.Attorney Ben Crump, who is representing members of Floyd’s family, called for an independent investigation, and said he asked to take custody of Floyd’s body to have an independent autopsy performed. Floyd said that talk of a heart condition or asthma are irrelevant because Floyd was walking and breathing before his contact with police.The doctor who will do the autopsy is Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York City, who was hired to do an autopsy for Eric Garner as well.Minutes after the precinct burned on Thursday, the Guard tweeted that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area. By Friday morning, a couple dozen Guard members armed with assault-style rifles blocked a street near a Target store that has sustained heavy damage by looters.The Guard said a “key objective” was to make sure firefighters could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet that soldiers would assist the Minneapolis Fire Department. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. Assistant Fire Chief Bryan Tyner said fire crews could not safely respond to blazes at the precinct station and some surrounding buildings.Elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice.In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver and downtown Columbus. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis.About 10 protesters went to a Florida home believed to belong to Chauvin. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office tweeted Friday that Chauvin was not at the residence and has no plans to be in the area.In Louisville, Kentucky, police confirmed that at least seven people had been shot Thursday night as protesters demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman who was fatally shot by police in her home in March.In Mississippi, the mayor of the community of Petal resisted calls to resign following his remarks about Floyd’s death. Hal Marx, a Republican, asked on Twitter: “Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?” In a follow-up tweet, he said he “didn’t see anything unreasonable.”The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk” and said he was “not in control of himself.”Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect.State and federal authorities are investigating Floyd’s death.Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday, along with three other officers involved in the arrest.The owner of a popular Latin nightclub said that Floyd and Chauvin both worked as security guards at the club as recently as the end of last year, but it’s not clear whether they worked together. Chauvin worked at the El Nuevo Rodeo club as an off-duty security guard for nearly two decades, but Floyd had only worked there more recently for about a dozen events that featured African-American music, Maya Santamaria told The Associated Press.Santamaria said if Chauvin had recognized Floyd, “he might have given him a little more mercy.”Santamaria, who sold the venue within the past two months, said Chauvin got along well with the regular Latino customers, but did not like to work the African-American nights. When he did, and there was a fight, he would spray people with mace and call for police backup and half-dozen squad cars would soon show up, something she felt was unjustified “overkill.”___Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee, and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minneapolis-cop-who-knelt-on-handcuffed-george-floyd-arrested/story-hwFr4QJTyOfvaA6LfVfh3L.html
29-05-2020||World||US Prez Donald Trump to rebuke China over Hong Kong friction, Covid-19||President Donald Trump is poised to sign a measure that would punish Chinese officials for imprisoning more than one million Muslims in internment camps, as he looks to rebuke Beijing over its crackdown in Hong Kong and its response to the coronavirus.Trump said he would announce on Friday what the administration would do “with respect to China,” though there’s no indication he’s planning to focus on the legislation. The White House has scheduled a news conference for 2 p.m.Trump is expected to eventually sign the China legislation, said Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The measure, which won broad bipartisan support in Congress, would require Trump to sanction any officials found responsible for the Muslims’ oppression and revoke their visas.“We fully anticipate within a matter of days that the president will sign this,” McCaul said on a conference call.Trump expressed displeasure with China after the country moved to pass national security legislation expected to curb freedoms in Hong Kong.“We are not happy with what’s happened,” Trump said Thursday, in response to a question about whether the US would remain in the “phase one” trade deal he signed with Chinese officials in January. Trump’s top economic aide Larry Kudlow told Fox News Friday that the US is “furious” with what China has done “in recent days, weeks and months.”Trump has shown little interest in human rights violations in China. But the national security law and Trump’s complaints about the country’s handling of the virus have escalated tensions between the world’s two largest economies, and prompted the White House to examine ways to retaliate.The president has discussed targeting China’s financial sector through sanctions and trade policy, according to people familiar with the matter. He’s also weighed unspecified visa restrictions on Chinese travelers, the people said.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Thursday that Trump hadn’t reviewed the congressional legislation because it hadn’t been forwarded to him. He said on Tuesday that he would “look at it very strongly.”Read more| Who Are the Uighurs? Why Does China Lock Them Up?: QuickTakeSecretary of State Michael Pompeo said Wednesday that Hong Kong has effectively lost its autonomy and no longer warrants special treatment under US law. The declaration opens the door for Trump to impose penalties ranging from modest sanctions to revoking Hong Kong’s special trading status with the U.S.China pushed back Friday, calling US actions over Hong Kong “purely nonsense” and repeating that the matter was an internal affair.Beijing urges the US to stop its “frivolous political manipulation,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters at a daily briefing, reiterating Beijing’s support for Hong Kong police in upholding the law.Trading BlameThe countries have traded insults and blame for the coronavirus pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei. But the illness has killed at least 100,000 Americans, far more deaths than China has reported, and Trump has sought to shift blame to Beijing as he his administration’s handling of the crisis has come under intense criticism.The human rights measure passed the House Wednesday on a vote of 413-1 and passed the Senate by unanimous consent. It condemns the internment of Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang region of China. The legislation calls for closing the camps where they are being held.Zhao, the foreign ministry spokesman, said the act “blatantly smears” China and interferes in its internal affairs.Signing the bill would mark a shift for Trump, who has been reluctant in the past to retaliate against China over human rights.But virus-related tensions between the two countries have converged with growing concern among China hawks within the administration over the Beijing government’s crackdown on free expression and religious minorities.Before the pandemic, Trump had been loath to denounce China in order to preserve his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping and the trade deal. Trump, for example, only offered lukewarm support for pro-democracy protests that swept Hong Kong last year as the deal was being negotiated.Overshadowing TradeBut the president recently indicated that the virus has overshadowed trade.“I feel differently now about that deal than I did three months ago,” Trump said during a May 19 cabinet meeting. “And we’ll see what all happens. But it’s been a very disappointing situation. Very disappointing thing happened with China because the plague flowed in. And that wasn’t supposed to happen, and it could have been stopped.”Decisions such as imposing tariffs or visa restrictions against Chinese officials over the government’s crackdown of Hong Kong have prompted internal debate over how far the US should go.“Hong Kong is clearly losing its freedom, China is now breaking longstanding rules and laws and treaties, that means Hong Kong will be treated differently,” top White House economic adviser Kudlow said Thursday on CNBC, adding that the country “has made a huge mistake.”But the Uighur bill may pose less political risk for the president. China hawks and human-rights groups have begun to express frustration that the administration has been reluctant to respond to China’s abuses and take broader actions to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.Small StepsThe administration so far has taken small steps toward penalizing China over its treatment of ethnic minorities.The Commerce Department announced last week it would add China’s Ministry of Public Security’s Institute of Forensic Science and eight Chinese companies to the entity list, which will result in new restrictions on access to US technology. The department accused them of human rights violations and abuses committed against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.The China legislation was passed under a new House rule allowing members to cast proxy votes for other lawmakers who stayed home during the pandemic -- an approach that may raise concern at the White House.But McCaul said he didn’t think that would affect Trump’s support for the measure. Republicans have sued Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats over the practice, which they argue is unconstitutional.“We’ll see how that lawsuit goes,” McCaul said. “There was such overwhelming bipartisan support that even if you canceled the proxy votes, I think there’d be a sufficient number of votes to have passed it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-donald-trump-to-rebuke-china-over-hong-kong-friction-covid-19/story-zvgHILZbYBKZcYohW67l4M.html
29-05-2020||World||Covid-19: US airlines leave $29 billion aid fund untapped in bet on rebound||US airlines have yet to tap $29 billion in federal pandemic relief loans as they wait to see whether the reopening of the economy revives demand and diminishes the need for money that comes with government strings attached.Although the four largest US passenger airlines have applied for the Treasury Department program, only American Airlines Group Inc. has said it intends to tap the pool of funds. Southwest Airlines Co., United Airlines Holdings and Delta Air Lines Inc. say they plan to wait until fall before deciding whether to take the money -- after a summer travel season that could see more people return to the skies.The wait-and-see approach illustrates how airlines are preparing for an uncertain future amid early signs of a recovery after Americans all but stopped flying in April due to the coronavirus and travel restrictions. A second wave of infections could make the situation worse.It also highlights how only a small portion of hundreds of billions of dollars available to the Treasury Department has actually been doled out to help companies.“That pool of money is designed as backstop financing and for those who can’t raise money elsewhere,” said Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen & Co. in New York.US airlines have separately raised billions in capital through methods including secured loans, bond offerings and equity sales, and Becker said that the federal loans are a last resort. The government loans would impose restrictions such as a cap on executive compensation and require carriers to offer equity or other financial stakes to the government in exchange for the aid.“The hope is that by September, the worst of the pandemic is behind us and people will be booking for travel in the fall and the holidays, and airlines won’t need to take the money,” Becker said.A Treasury Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the number of loan applications received and when the money would be distributed. The department has separately disbursed $25 billion from its payroll support program. Airlines accepting the funds, which are a mix of grants and loans, are required to refrain from layoffs until after Sept. 30.Airlines have pointed to signs that travel demand is beginning to perk up in recent weeks, fuelling hopes that the stress on beleaguered carriers could begin to wane. Passengers taking flights over Memorial Day weekend, an early test of consumer confidence and the unofficial start of the summer travel season, reached levels unseen since late March. Airlines say bookings are outpacing cancellations, and airplanes that have been almost empty are starting to fill up.Carriers are far from out of the woods, however. The aviation industry’s recovery from the coronavirus outbreak will be long and slow, with global passenger numbers likely to stay below pre-pandemic levels through 2023, according to S&P Global Ratings, which warned of more rating downgrades for airports over the next few months.Although 321,776 people passed through security at US airports on Thursday in one of the busiest days since late March, that’s still an 87% decline from the equivalent day last year, according to the US Transportation Security Administration. Airlines have openly discussed the likely need to shed thousands of workers after a prohibition on job cuts tied to the payroll support program expires.On Thursday, for example, American Airlines announced plans to shed 30% of its management and support staff to align its operations with dramatic declines in travel.“While I don’t want to get into specifics, we continue to have very productive conversations with Treasury Department and its advisers,” American Airlines President Robert Isom said at an industry conference May 19. “Treasury has been nothing but fantastic to work with through these unprecedented times, and we remain very confident that we will move forward with this loan in a prudent and efficient manner.”Delta, SouthwestThe Treasury Department launched the loan program April 8, and has made no further announcements since it closed on April 17. The agency is weighing whether it will disburse the money in one or several tranches as the outlook for the industry’s recovery becomes clear, a person familiar with the matter said. The program may also evolve as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hasn’t settled on the details, the person said.Delta has applied for the additional Treasury loan “to hold our place in line,” Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said at the same Wolfe Research conference. “We have until September to make a decision about that as well as other financing sources should we need them.”“We’ve applied for it,” Southwest Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said of the potential $2.8 billion loan at the carrier’s annual shareholder meeting May 21. “We’ve not committed to take that money and we have until September 30 to make that decision.”The airline loan program is yet another piece of the pandemic rescue funds enacted on March 27 -- when Congress and the White House were so panicked that Covid-19 would ravage the US economy that they quickly came together -- that may not be working as designed.Virus RescueMnuchin has only used $37.5 billion out of a $454 billion fund to backstop central bank emergency lending, though $195 billion has been committed for use. A Main Street lending facility that Congress asked the Federal Reserve to launch to support small and medium-sized companies is still not operational even as businesses lay off workers, shutter and eye bankruptcy. The Paycheck Protection Program for smaller companies has been riddled with glitches, and now needs to be fixed to extend the relief.Mnuchin also hasn’t disbursed a $17 billion pot of money reserved for companies deemed critical to national security. The largest expected recipient, Boeing Co., got help from private investors. For the hundreds of thousands of other defence contractors in the Pentagon’s supply chain, Treasury’s criteria is too strict to qualify.The loan packages for airlines and companies critical to national security, if untapped, can be used to backstop additional lending by the Fed.“With a lot of these programs it turns out they’re not for everybody, said Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners in Washington. “There’s a general feeling of anguish and pain as people are unemployed, underemployed and businesses shut down -- surely the government can do more for them.”Not a BailoutFederal loans for the airline industry, which Mnuchin has repeatedly said are not a “bailout,” come with strings attached that analysts say may be less attractive than private markets. Any company tapping the loan pool must assure the government that credit is “not reasonably available” elsewhere.United Airlines, for example, is eligible for a loan of as much as $4.5 billion and the company expects to issue the department warrants to purchase 14.2 million shares of the company’s common stock, CFO Gerald Laderman said in a May 1 earnings call.Savanthi Syth, an analyst at Raymond James, said the department’s terms are not excessive but are onerous enough for airlines to turn first to the private sector.“The test for whether airlines will need this will be how much demand comes back this summer,” she said. “If we see demand getting back to 50% levels of last year, they might not need to tap it.”The $2.2 trillion pandemic stimulus package that authorized the airline loans gives Treasury until the end of the year to disburse them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-us-airlines-leave-29-billion-aid-fund-untapped-in-bet-on-rebound/story-dmTg8jb4PYE4aiT2IqRKEK.html
29-05-2020||World||‘Concerned’ over new China security law, UK plans citizenship to 3.1 lakh Hong Kong residents||Terming China’s new security law a violation of an agreement reached when Britain handed over Hong Kong in 1997, the Boris Johnson government plans to offer citizenship to over 3.1 lakh residents of its former colony, in a move that has ruffled feathers in Beijing.Nearly 315,000 Hong Kong residents who registered before the 1997 handover are entitled to ‘British National (Overseas)’ status, which allows limited entry to the UK. There has been a long-standing campaign to extend them full citizenship rights.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab has announced the government’s intention to consider extending full citizenship to holders of BNO status, as a joint statement by the UK, US, Australia and Canada expressed ‘deep concern’ over the new law that has prompted clashed in Hong Kong. Reports say Beijing would consider the UK plan as an interference.Raab said: “Currently they (BNO passport holders) only have the right to come to the UK for six months. If China continues down this path and implements this national security legislation we will change that status, and we will remove that six-month limit and allow those BNO passport holders to come to the UK and to apply to work and study for extendable periods of 12 months and that would itself provide a pathway to future citizenship”.“If they implement and apply this national security legislation in the terms that have been described, we will change the BNO passport holder status and the arrangements for them in the way that I’ve just described”, he added.The new security law for Hong Kong, passed by China on Thursday, makes any show of dissidence against the mainland a crime and for the first time paves the way for Beijing to install its own security agencies in the protest-wracked city. There have been violent protests in Hong Kong since last June on the issue: Beijing’s apparent tightening of control over the city and its impact on freedoms including that of free speech and expression.Campaigners say Raab’s current offer does not go far enough to protect the rights of BNO holders if and when they are allowed into the UK for more than the current period of six months, but await more details.The four-country joint statement by Raab, Australian foreign minister Marise Payne, Canadian foreign minister François-Philippe Champagne, and US secretary of state Michael Pompeo said: “Hong Kong has flourished as a bastion of freedom. The international community has a significant and long-standing stake in Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability”.“Direct imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong by the Beijing authorities, rather than through Hong Kong’s own institutions as provided for under Article 23 of the Basic Law, would curtail the Hong Kong people’s liberties, and in doing so, dramatically erode Hong Kong’s autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous”. They added that China’s decision to impose the new law on Hong Kong was in direct conflict with its international obligations under the principles of the legally-binding, UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration.The foreign ministers said: “The world’s focus on a global pandemic requires enhanced trust in governments and international cooperation. Beijing’s unprecedented move risks having the opposite effect”.“As Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity are jeopardised by the new imposition, we call on the Government of China to work with the Hong Kong SAR Government and the people of Hong Kong to find a mutually acceptable accommodation that will honour China’s international obligations under the UN-filed Sino-British Joint Declaration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/concerned-over-new-china-security-law-uk-plans-citizenship-to-3-1-lakh-hong-kong-residents/story-uc55wTlWgBSiByJZseIMNJ.html
29-05-2020||World||Trump defends India-China mediation offer as effort to address PM Modi’s ‘mood’||US President Donald Trump has defended his offer to mediate the India-China border dispute saying Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been unhappy about the situation.“I can tell you, I did speak to Prime Minister Modi. He’s not -- he’s not in a good mood about what’s going on with China,” Trump told reporters in response to a question on Thursday.“I would do that,” he said in response to another question about his offer to mediate. “You know, I would do that. If they -- if they thought it would help if I were the mediator or the arbiter, I would do that. So, we’ll see.”As expected, India has politely and indirectly turned down Trump’s offer to mediate with the external affairs ministry (MEA) spokesperson telling reporters in New Delhi, in response to a direct and specific question about it, that India was in talks with China to resolve the dispute.Trump had offered to mediate on the border issue between New Delhi and Beijing in a tweet on Wednesday morning. “We have informed both India and China that the United States is ready, willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute,” Trump wrote.There are no public readouts of a conversation between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi after April 4, when they discussed Trump’s specific request to Modi to lift the ban on the export of hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug Trump has promoted as a “game-changer” cure for Covid-19, and which he has himself used as a preventative after possible exposure to the coronavirus after two White House staffers tested positive.This is the second time Trump has referred to a conversation with Modi details of which are not backed by public records or readouts.Trump had in 2019 said while offering to mediate India’s dispute with Pakistan to a direct request from Prime Minister Imran Khan that he had been asked by Modi earlier as well. India had denied that assertion and swiftly rejected his offer.New Delhi took longer to reject Trump’s mediation offer on China in contrast. There was a view in certain quarters in the Indian foreign policy establishment that the offer of help, though dead on arrival, would irk China, which has responded with prickly no-thank-you. “We are capable of properly resolving the issues between us through dialogue and consultation. We do not need the intervention of a third party,” a spokesperson told reporters in Beijing. “Between China and India we have existing border-related mechanisms and communication channels.”At the White House event, Trump described the India-China border dispute as a “big conflict” and said, “Two countries with 1.4 billion people. Two countries with very powerful militaries. And India is not happy, and probably China is not happy.”He also referred to his India trip in February, saying, “I got back -- I know. And they like me in India. I think they like me in India certainly more than the media likes me in this country.”The United States has been closely watching the latest flareup on the India-China border, and backed India in its first official response. The flareups were a “reminder that Chinese aggression is not always just rhetorical”, Alice Wells, the top US diplomat for South and Central Asia told reporters last week.“Whether it’s in the South China Sea or whether it’s along the border with India, we continue to see provocations and disturbing behavior by China that raises questions about how China seeks to use its growing power,” she had added.Trump administration officials have refused to comment further on the president mediation offer tweeted Wednesday. And there have been no explanations forthcoming for it, except that it could be a part of the growing antipathy for China in the United State that the president and his allies are hoping to tap into with an eye on the November general elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-defends-india-china-mediation-offer-as-effort-to-address-pm-modi-s-mood/story-6yNBZF0bcRCROEzaH23bjN.html
29-05-2020||World||EU weighs China policy amid concern over Hong Kong moves||European Union foreign ministers debated Friday ways to manage tense relations with China as it asserts more control over Hong Kong and amid concern about Beijing’s influence over EU officials.The ministers, holding talks via videoconference, are weighing the need for firm policy against the damage that it might do to business ties between the Asian economic giant and the world’s biggest trading bloc.The 27 EU nations are often divided in their approach to China, but Beijing’s imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong — a Chinese territory that is supposed to have a high degree of autonomy under a “one-country, two systems” framework — seems to have united them.“Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy cannot be undermined. We expect the freedoms and rights for the citizens to be protected through their basic law and the ‘one country, two systems’ principle,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Friday.Hong Kong’s pro-democracy opposition sees the move as an assault on the territory’s autonomy, and the United States has called on China to back off on the security law. But no talk of any EU action, never mind sanctions, is likely.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who is chairing the meeting, said Monday that the bloc needs a “more robust strategy” toward China amid signs that Asia is replacing the United States as the center of global power.Borrell said that relations between Brussels and Beijing aren’t always based on trust, transparency and reciprocity, and that “we only have a chance if we deal with China with collective discipline.”He noted that an EU-China summit this fall could be an opportunity to do so.In recent weeks, Borrell has been forced twice to deny that the External Action Service — the EU’s equivalent of a foreign office —has bowed to Chinese pressure to water down a report on fake news linked to the coronavirus and a newspaper op-ed referencing the disease’s origins in Wuhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-weighs-china-policy-amid-concern-over-hong-kong-moves/story-QXK38HwC6bH6tZaehW58EJ.html

The steps we take to rebuild our economies will have a profound impact on our societies’ future sustainability, resilience and well-being and COP26 can be a moment where the world unites behind a clean resilient recovery”, he added. The decision on the new date comes as the UK Government announced that over 25 experts in multiple global sectors will be advising the COP26 Presidency. The Friends of COP bring expertise from countries across six continents, including France, Barbados, Chad, Australia, India and Peru.As the host of COP26 in November 2021, the officials said the UK will continue to work with all involved to increase climate action, build resilience and lower emissions. The new date will also allow the UK and Italian partners to harness incoming G7 and G20 presidencies in driving climate ambition.UN climate change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa said: “Our efforts to address climate change and Covid-19 are not mutually exclusive.

29-05-2020||World||14 Afghan security force members killed in attack claimed by Taliban||Taliban fighters stormed an Afghan border post Friday, killing at least 14 security force members, the insurgents and officials said, the latest in a series of attacks since the end of a brief ceasefire.Despite the clashes, Afghan authorities have vowed to press on with efforts to help reduce violence following the temporary pause in fighting.“Last night the mujahideen carried out attacks against the newly established posts of the enemy in Dande Patan district of Paktia province,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Twitter.“The enemy has been recently trying to expand its rule in mujahideen territories,” he said, adding that two Taliban fighters were also killed.Afghan officials confirmed the attack in the early hours of Friday had killed 14 Afghan security force members.Dande Patan district governor Eid Mohammad Ahmadzai told AFP that 15 security force members and 20 Taliban fighters were killed in the fighting.Officials had also accused the Taliban of carrying out two other raids on separate checkpoints on Thursday, killing 14 Afghan security force members, but the Taliban have not commented on those attacks.A three-day truce offered by the militants officially ended late on Tuesday, with the overall lull in the country’s grinding violence largely holding, officials and experts have said.The country’s National Security Council spokesman Javid Faisal said that efforts to extend the ceasefire were continuing.“The detente that started during Eid ul-Fitr continues despite reports of scattered incidents to the contrary,” he said on Twitter.“A ceasefire is a complex operational undertaking that requires significant and ongoing coordination to avoid incidents. Those efforts will continue.”Afghan authorities have responded to the formal ceasefire by pushing forward with an agreed prisoner exchange, releasing some 1,000 Taliban prisoners this week, with plans to release more in the coming days.As part of the ongoing swap, the militants on Thursday released 80 Afghan policemen and soldiers they had been holding captive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/14-afghan-security-force-members-killed-in-attack-claimed-by-taliban/story-ETzLWos1TvdQ2fTLhFDE4J.html

Hundreds of people have been arrested during recent demonstrations that seek to revive the momentum of protests that shut down large parts of the city during the second half of last year.China’s National People’s Congress on Thursday voted to approve the bill that will now be sent to its standing committee for final approval. Details of the final version of the law aren’t known, but China says it will prohibit separatist activities and actions that might threaten the Communist Party’s monopoly on political power in mainland China.Beijing and its supporters in Hong Kong are defending the legislative move against criticism from foreign countries, including the U.S., which has threatened to revoke special trade privileges granted to the former British colony when it was handed over to China in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” framework in which it was guaranteed its own political, legal, social and legal institutions for 50 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protest-in-hong-kong-over-china-move-to-pass-security-law/story-cRmCPQNIa4XVO9YcNeAFpJ.html
29-05-2020||World||Trump’s social-media order may fail, but scores political points||President Donald Trump unleashed an executive order targeting social media companies like Twitter Inc. that have drawn his wrath of late -- a move that raised immediate doubts about its constitutionality and whether it would actually deliver its intended punch.Yet, the order Thursday succeeded on another level for Trump. It shifted attention from his struggles responding to the coronavirus pandemic and a cratering U.S. economy. It also delivered a stark warning to the internet giants he has tussled with since taking office, while sending an encouraging message to his political base.The move showed Trump using the power of his office to squeeze an industry over a political grievance, in this case his complaint that Twitter fact-checked his tweets about mail-in ballots. The order -- which could expose Twitter, Facebook Inc. and other technology giants to a flurry of lawsuits -- sparked broad condemnation from liberals and even some conservatives who accused the president of launching an unconstitutional assault on free speech.Trump, who uses Twitter to bypass the mainstream media and communicate directly with his base, is stoking the fight just as his re-election in November is increasingly at risk over his handling of the pandemic, which has killed more than 100,000 people and forced millions out of work.Fordham University law professor Olivier Sylvain called the order little more than bluster to please Trump’s base, which is receptive to his claims that the social-media platforms censor right-wing viewpoints. Sylvain and other scholars said the measure is toothless, disjointed and unlikely to survive a court challenge.“These are editorial decisions that are in the heartland of what we think is protected speech,” Sylvain said. “Even threatening it from the White House, that should be deeply troubling to anybody.”The order, which is the result of a multi-year effort by Trump to rein in the internet platforms over his claims of anti-conservative bias, seeks to narrow liability protections that social media companies enjoy for posts by third parties. It specifically names Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube for their power to shape public perceptions and raises the specter that the government is trying to punish decisions about content by the platforms that it disagrees with, which is banned by the free-speech protections in the First Amendment.It also revives Trump’s anti-Obama rhetoric, and he complained that: “As recently as last week, Representative Adam Schiff was continuing to mislead his followers by peddling the long-disproved Russian Collusion Hoax, and Twitter did not flag those tweets.”Twitter shares fell 4.5% in New York trading, the most since April 30, while Facebook shares slipped 1.6%.Liability protections for internet platforms are spelled out under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which allows the companies to display content that’s controversial, offensive and libelous without fear of lawsuits. The law also protects companies from legal repercussions if they take down posts “in good faith” -- a term it leaves undefined -- because lawmakers wanted to limit objectionable content, including pornography.The Little Law That Made the Internet a Free for All: QuickTakeThe executive order takes aim at this second protection by pushing the Federal Communications Commission to issue rules defining bad faith. That could open the door for lawsuits if the decisions to take down content were inconsistent with companies’ terms of service, didn’t provide enough notice or meet other criteria laid out by the FCC.The order also pushes the FCC to examine whether companies should still enjoy a legal shield when they leave users’ controversial content on display.Trump, who routinely courts and promotes conservative provocateurs online, has repeatedly charged that the social media platforms silence right-wing ideas and has suggested that the federal government should intervene to protect free speech.“In a country that has long cherished the freedom of expression, we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to hand-pick the speech that Americans may access and convey on the Internet,” the order stated.“This will be a Big Day for social media and FAIRNESS!” Trump said in a tweet Thursday morning that has garnered more than 270,000 likes.Trade groups representing technology platforms, civil liberties organizations and legal scholars slammed initial reports of the executive order, saying that it was unlikely to survive a court challenge and that punishing ideas that the administration dislikes is incompatible with the order’s claims of protecting free speech.The order “would be a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies that displease the president,” said Kate Ruane, senior legislative counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is a frequent Trump critic. She said it was ironic that the president, a prolific Tweeter, would attempt to weaken the company’s protections against the kind of controversial content he often spreads.“The president is trampling the first amendment by threatening the fundamental free-speech rights of social-media platforms,” said Steve DelBianco, president of NetChoice, a conservative-allied trade association that counts Twitter and Facebook as members.Denunciations by DemocratsThe order sparked a chorus of criticisms from Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump’s presumptive Democratic challenger, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who helped write Section 230 when he served in the House in the 1990’s.“Donald Trump’s misinformation campaigns have left death and destruction in their wake,” Wyden said in a statement. “He’s clearly targeting Section 230 because it protects private businesses’ right not to have to play host to his lies.”Twitter and other social-media companies have apologized for occasional mistakes around taking down harmful or misleading content, but deny that they deliberately silence any political viewpoints. The platforms say they are focused on users who are threatening or spread harmful misinformation on issues such as voting or the coronavirus.Yet some conservatives celebrated the executive order, saying the power of the internet giants must be reined in. “Given the political and cultural influence that these multinational corporations wield, it is of utmost importance to defend free speech values,” said Jon Schweppe, director of policy and government affairs of the Trump-allied American Principles Project, although he expressed some reservations about the order’s “deference to federal agencies.”The order directs the Commerce Department to ask the FCC for the rulemaking within 60 days. If the agency decides to take up the issue, it could still be months before it issues a final regulation. The FCC could decline to act because it isn’t controlled by the Commerce Department. Any rules could also spark lawsuits from the companies, which they would likely win, according to Gautam Hans, a law professor at Vanderbilt University.Andrew Jay Schwartzman, senior counselor at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, said the FCC has no authority to enforce Section 230 and called the directive “preposterous, but at the same time, horrifying.”The FCC, which is independent from the White House and is overseen by Congress, regulates airwaves uses and telephone providers, and doesn’t oversee internet companies. The order attempts to give the agency a role by having the Commerce Department request action.“This is about working the ref” and intimidating Twitter, said Gigi Sohn, who served as counselor to former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, a Democrat.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai -- a Republican and Trump appointee -- has criticized Twitter for what he called a politically motivated approach to content.“This debate is an important one,” Pai said in a statement Thursday, adding that his agency “will carefully review any petition for rulemaking filed by the Department of Commerce.”FCC Commissioner Michael O’Rielly, a Republican, slammed the platforms in a tweet and said that he wasn’t troubled by the White House’s seeking a “review of the statute’s application.” But he added that the First Amendment “governs much here.”Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement that an executive order that would turn the agency into “the president’s speech police is not the answer” to frustrations with social media. “It’s time for those in Washington to speak up for the First Amendment,” she said.The order also calls on the Federal Trade Commission, which has a consumer protection mandate, to take a closer look at whether companies misrepresent how they moderate content. It also convenes a working group of state attorneys general to look into similar practices, working with the Justice Department.The FTC said in a statement that it’s committed to laws “consistent with our jurisdictional authority and constitutional limitations.”The order would also initiate a review of all ad spending on the platforms by executive branch agencies with reports to the government’s budget office and have the Justice Department determine if the platforms are “problematic vehicles for government speech.” The department should also propose legislation to change the law, under the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-social-media-order-may-fail-but-scores-political-points/story-3uBn74xilHzhg7nlLQkVhL.html

Many medical staff have been living away from homes while working in hospitals as the National Health Service grapples with the pandemic. As of Thursday evening, there have been 37,837 deaths and 269,127 cases in the UK.The Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust on Friday paid tributes to Gupta, who was working in its hospital near London.“Rajesh, who worked as a consultant at Wexham Park Hospital, was found dead on Monday afternoon in the hotel where he had been staying to protect his family while he worked with us during the coronavirus pandemic. At this stage the cause of his death is not known”.“Rajesh was a popular and well-known figure across the trust, described by colleagues as an outstanding clinician with a passion for pain medicine. He had recently been appointed to a substantive post at Wexham after working for a period as a locum consultant at Frimley Park”, the trust said.Colleagues described Gupta as a gifted poet, painter, photographer and cook who was known for his enthusiasm and kindness. He wrote several books and contributed to a number of publications.The trust added: “He will be greatly missed. On behalf of the whole trust we would like to pass our deepest condolences to Rajesh’s family and loved ones, including his wife and young son. This news has come as an enormous shock to Rajesh’s immediate colleagues and we are supporting them at this difficult time”.Besides Gupta, the grim list of Indian heritage doctors and nurses dying during the pandemic include Jitendra Kumar Rathod, Manjeet Singh Riyat, Krishan Arora, Rajesh Kalraiya, Pooja Sharma, Jayesh Patel, Vivek Sharma, Kamlesh Kumar Masson, Amarante Dias, Sophie Fagan, Hamza Pacheeri and Amrik Bamotra.EOM||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-doctor-in-uk-working-during-covid-19-pandemic-found-dead-in-hotel/story-6cOhggthdKl5LRtuIcmxIO.html
29-05-2020||World||Europe reaches a tipping point over China’s Hong Kong gamble||Europe’s relations with China are going from bad to worse.Beijing’s decision to force national security laws on Hong Kong has outraged many in the European Union for what they see as an attack on democracy. It places EU governments on the horns of a dilemma over how to respond as they shift from battling the coronavirus to economic recovery, where trade with China is likely to play a big part.That is set to leave Europe somewhere in the middle as the US weighs a range of penalties on China for encroaching further on Hong Kong’s freedoms. The EU’s chief foreign envoy, Josep Borrell, said this week that sanctions were not the solution “to our problems with China.” In a letter to the bloc’s foreign ministers ahead of a pre-scheduled video conference meeting on China on Friday, he urged them to consider “the tools of leverage we have.”Yet European anger is palpable, and there are signs that China’s moves could have ramifications further down the line, by speeding European efforts to adopt a more unified industrial policy and influencing decisions on the role of Huawei Technologies Co. in 5G networks. A post-pandemic rescue plan presented by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron last week aims to fortify Europe internally, but also contains measures to equip it to better face outside threats.Diplomacy is meanwhile at a low ebb, with China provoking European governments through aggressive social media posts over their handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, and some European officials criticizing Beijing in turn for its early response to the outbreak. While preparations officially continue for the first-ever summit of the EU’s 27 leaders and President Xi Jinping this fall, China watchers from academia to industry say they doubt the event billed as the highlight of a year of China-Europe engagement will even take place.The upshot is a collection of friction points that may tip European leaders further toward a reassessment of China as more of a threat to Europe than viewing it as an ally against the Trump administration’s anti-globalization tendencies.“Things are changing,” said Jean-Maurice Ripert, who was France’s ambassador to China until late 2019. The pandemic led to “an awakening toward China’s expansionist ambitions,” he said. “The Covid crisis and what’s going on in Hong Kong are opening the eyes of those who didn’t believe it.”It’s an assessment shared by some leading politicians. Norbert Roettgen, chair of the Bundestag foreign affairs committee and an outside contender to succeed Merkel as chancellor, says that Europe’s credibility is on the line over its response to China.Germany’s position in shaping Europe’s response will be key, both as the EU’s biggest economy and since it will assume the bloc’s rotating presidency on July 1. EU relations with China were supposed to be the centerpiece of Germany’s presidency, but the pandemic has shifted priorities.The Chinese move against Hong Kong caught everyone off guard, according to a German government official with knowledge of the thinking in the Chancellery. That contributes to the dilemma Germany finds itself in. Merkel isn’t willing to join Donald Trump’s attacks, which include repeated references to Covid-19 as a “Chinese virus,” but she is aware the security situation in Hong Kong could deteriorate rapidly. Nobody wants a new Cold War, said the official, asking not to be named discussing internal strategy.“China is not merely a partner and competitor, but a country with which we have profound differences with respect to the rule of law, freedom, democracy and human rights,” Merkel said in a speech Wednesday. While she referred to the “one country, two systems” principle for Hong Kong, the chancellor said that even such fundamental divisions shouldn’t prevent dialogue and cooperation.Merkel’s high-wire balancing act has its critics. Nils Schmid, a senior lawmaker with her Social Democratic Party coalition partner, accused the chancellor this week of having an outdated idea of China as an economic partner above all, and of underestimating the “systemic challenges” posed by Beijing. Merkel has resisted a blanket ban on Huawei from 5G networks, a step favored by Roettgen among others.‘Schizophrenic’Europe should have leverage over China given Beijing’s need for allies in its deepening standoff with the US In reality, the bloc is divided between those such as Italy and Hungary, enthusiastic backers of Xi’s trademark Belt and Road investment and infrastructure program, and others including France and Germany, which are more wary in their dealings with Beijing.One EU diplomat who asked not to be named discussing Friday’s foreign ministers call described the bloc’s approach to China as “schizophrenic,” saying that it can’t decide if China is a strategic partner or an aggressive rival.Still, in their joint plan, Merkel and Macron are pushing for stronger European industrial defenses and a reduced dependence on China. With its references to European champions -- Macron spoke of “technological sovereignty” -- a bloc-wide strategic health care industry and a focus on green and digital transitions, it represents much more than just the headline 500 billion-euro ($554 billion) rescue fund, said Erik Nielsen, chief economist at UniCredit.For Janka Oertel, director of the Asia program at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, the Merkel-Macron proposal, which still needs the agreement of the bloc’s members, “was all about China without talking about China.”Strategic Reassessment“This is exactly where we are in the conversation, a European strategic reassessment of the relationship with China, and the challenges that China poses not globally but quite directly to the European economy,” she said.In Paris, the official emphasis is on “rebalancing” European-Chinese relations toward greater reciprocal market access and the shared fight against climate change. Questions about Chinese interference in Hong Kong put to the French foreign ministry were directed to a tepid EU statement from this week in which the bloc said it attached “great importance” to the preservation of the territory’s autonomy, but fell short of criticizing China.Even such declarations matter, and work will still be underway to forge a common European position, said Ripert, the French diplomat. “The situation is potentially explosive so it’s not unusual that Europe is taking its time,” he said. “Combative speeches are useless.”Chinese officials have sought to downplay the potential impact of the national security legislation in Hong Kong, saying it will only affect a small number of people who helped foment violent protests last year. In an open letter to the city’s residents, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said “the overwhelming majority of citizens” would continue to enjoy the freedoms such as speech, the press and assembly under laws now being drafted by the National People’s Congress, China’s legislature.5G Networks“The EU will just say something for political reasons but it’s really more concerned about the recession,” said Wang Yiwei, a former Chinese diplomat at the Chinese embassy in Brussels. “They always talk about the rule of law but actually this is the rule of law. Since Hong Kong is part of China, of course its future will be decided by the NPC. The EU should support this decision but some lobbyists may be against it.”Xi might have miscalculated by sanctioning an attack on Hong Kong’s democracy, said Reinhard Buetikofer, a German Green lawmaker who chairs the EU Parliament’s delegation for China relations.If Beijing decides to pursue its course in Hong Kong, no one has the leverage to stop it, so the message must be “that it will come with a cost,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “And I would assume that some of the issues that have been contentious around Europe, like the issue of are we going to allow Huawei to participate in building of the 5G networks, may look differently under the auspices of recent Chinese actions.”Legislation is still being drawn up in Berlin on 5G networks as part of an IT security law, with negotiations on Huawei’s involvement likely in the coming weeks before a draft goes to cabinet, possibly before the summer break. The debate over China more broadly has hardened, according to a German lawmaker familiar with the drafting.The U.K. has opened a fresh review of Huawei’s role in its networks after the US moved to shut down the Chinese company’s access to American technology. Those actions will influence German decision-making, said the ECFR’s Oertel.On Sunday, as Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned the US against starting a “new Cold War” with China, the ministry posted a series of tweets in English calling for solidarity with Europe. The pandemic requires both sides to “rise above ideological differences” and China and the EU should be “comprehensive strategic partners.”For Friedolin Strack, managing director of the Asia-Pacific Committee of German Business, dialogue is essential and “decoupling” from China is not an option. But he too favors a stronger, more united Europe to better protect against issues like the distortion of competition by state-owned enterprises.Strack’s committee helped shape an influential paper by the German BDI industry lobby last year that caused ripples across Europe and in Beijing by arguing for a more clear-eyed stance toward China. Two months later, the EU labeled China a systemic rival. He now sees an opportunity for Europe as “a strong middle partner,” sharing US values while cooperating with China on multilateral solutions. “There is a huge potential in positioning the EU as a stronger global player,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-reaches-a-tipping-point-over-china-s-hong-kong-gamble/story-fWPX66HccXikIZueaezEXJ.html
29-05-2020||World||New Zealand near eradication, but Covid-19 has grim hold on the planet||New Zealand on Friday had all but eradicated the coronavirus from its shores with just one person in the nation of 5 million known to be still infected, but developments elsewhere were generally grim, with India reporting another record increase in cases and Pakistan a record number of deaths.In the US, the virus threw more than 2 million people out of work last week despite the gradual reopening of businesses, stoking fears the scourge is doing deep and potentially long-lasting damage to the world’s largest economy.The latest job-loss figures from the US Labor Department bring to 41 million the running total of Americans who have filed for unemployment benefits since the coronavirus shutdowns took hold in mid-March.In New Zealand, health authorities have not found any new virus cases for a week. Of the 1,504 people who were infected, 22 have died and all but one of the rest have now recovered. The nation’s borders remain closed and staying virus-free when they eventually reopen poses a big challenge.India registered another record daily increase of 7,466 cases just before its two-month lockdown ends Sunday. The government’s new guidelines expected this weekend may extend the lockdown in the worst-hit areas while easing the rules to promote economic activity elsewhere.Most cases in India are concentrated around its largest cities, including Mumbai and New Delhi, but cases have been increasing in some of the poorest eastern states as migrant workers who lost jobs in the cities return to their native villages.Pakistan on Friday reported 57 deaths, its highest single-day increase since the outbreak began. That increased the overall death toll to more than 1,300 and the number of cases to over 64,000.In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte decided to ease a lockdown in the capital to a more relaxed quarantine on Monday after more than two months of strictures enforced by the police and military. Infections spiked in Manila recently, and Duterte warned that the pandemic is not over and the quarantine was in place around the country.In the US, where the death toll is the highest in the world and has surpassed 101,000, there were some encouraging signs in the economic data.The overall number of Americans currently drawing jobless benefits dropped for the first time since the crisis began, from 25 million to 21 million. And first-time applications for unemployment benefits have fallen for eight straight weeks, as states gradually let stores, restaurants and other businesses reopen and the auto industry starts up factories again.But the number of US workers filing for unemployment benefits is still extraordinarily high by historical standards, and that suggests businesses are failing or permanently downsizing, not just laying off people until the crisis can pass, economists warn.“That is the kind of economic destruction you cannot quickly put back in the bottle,” said Adam Ozimek, chief economist at Upwork.The US unemployment rate was 14.7% in April, a level not seen since the Depression, and many economists expect it will be near 20% in May.Other looming storm clouds: Economists say the sharp loss of tax revenue is likely to force public-sector layoffs. And cuts beyond the initially hit industries such as restaurants and stores are a sign of spreading, potentially lasting damage. Economists say double-digit unemployment could persist through 2021.A number of European countries have strong safety-net programs that are underwriting the wages of millions of workers and keeping them on the payroll instead of adding them to the ranks of the unemployed. But the economic damage is mounting there, too.Nissan is rolling back production in Spain in a move the government said could lead to 3,000 direct job cuts and thousands more losses at the automaker’s suppliers. And French unemployment claims jumped 22% in April, with 843,000 more people seeking work.Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 5.8 million people and killed about 360,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true dimensions of the disaster are widely believed to be significantly greater, with experts saying many victims died without ever being tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-near-eradication-but-covid-19-has-grim-hold-on-the-planet/story-TMnkMnp9yoTEivM21KXvvK.html
29-05-2020||World||China plans to extend curbs on international flights till June 30: US embassy||Chinese civil aviation authorities plan to extend until June 30 their curbs on international flights to contain the spread of the coronavirus, the U.S. embassy in Beijing said in a travel advisory on Friday.China has drastically cut such flights since March to allay concerns over infections brought by arriving passengers. A so-called “Five One” policy allows mainland carriers to fly just one flight a week on one route to any country and foreign airlines to operate just one flight a week to China.Washington has accused Beijing of making it impossible for U.S. airlines to resume service to China and ordered four Chinese airlines to file flight schedules with the U.S. government. Delta Air Lines and United Airlines wanted to resume flights to China in June, the U.S. Transportation Department has noted.U.S. airlines are not flying to China at all because they suspended services before the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) imposed restrictions on air travel.Chinese airlines have over the past few days submitted flight schedules to the U.S. Department of Transportation, Reuters searches on a U.S. government website showed.China Southern Airlines is proposing to add more flights to multiple U.S. cities from July, while China Eastern Airlines is aiming to ramp up capacity from September, according to the U.S. government website.When asked about the U.S. embassy statement on the extension of restrictions, a CAAC news department official told Reuters there was no change to the existing rules.The maximum number of international flights now allowed is 134 a week under restrictions imposed on March 29.State media has reported that China’s aviation authority would consider increasing international flights as long as imported coronavirus risks are under control, citing the agency’s deputy director Li Jian.China has brought the outbreak largely under control with draconian lockdowns and quarantine rules. No new confirmed cases were reported in the mainland on Thursday. The total number of infections stand at 82,995, of which 1,734 are imported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-plans-to-extend-curbs-on-international-flights-till-june-30-us-embassy/story-Xp0pxNB1Jtg9ZjfNQlVOhP.html
29-05-2020||World||‘No need for third party intervention’: China rejects Trump’s offer to mediate in border row with India||China on Friday rejected the US offer to mediate in the current Sino-India border standoff, reiterating that the two countries have existing communication mechanisms to resolve problems.“We do not need the intervention of the third party,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said when asked to comment on US President Donald Trump’s tweeted offer that he was willing to mediate between New Delhi and Beijing to resolve the latest friction along the line of actual control (LAC) between the Himalayan neighbours.Trump’s offer and the Chinese foreign ministry’s latest statement came in the backdrop of the ongoing standoff in eastern Ladakh and skirmish near the Sikkim border between the militaries of India and China this month.Also read: India snubs Trump’s offer on China border row, says no compromise on national securityBeijing’s rejection of the US offer comes a day after New Delhi had subtly let it pass.“As I’ve told you, we are engaged with the Chinese side to peacefully resolve this issue,” Anurag Srivastava, external affairs minister, had said in New Delhi when asked about Trump’s tweet on Thursday.On Friday, it was China’s turn.“Between China and India, we have existing border related mechanism and communication channels. We are capable of properly resolving the issues between us through dialogue and consultation. We do not need the intervention of the third party,” he said.Both Zhao and, for the first time, defence ministry spokesperson Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang commenting on the situation on Thursday, said the situation at the border was “stable and controllable”.“The two sides have the ability to communicate and solve relevant issues through the established border-related mechanisms and diplomatic channels,” Ren had also said at an online interaction with journalists on Thursday.Also read: In Donald Trump’s order to raise bar for social media giants, China is the ammo“We have been implementing the important consensus reached by leaders of both the countries, observing the bilateral agreements and have been committed to safeguarding territorial sovereignty and security, stability and peace in the border area,” Zhao said at the regular ministry briefing on Friday.The statements from the Chinese foreign and defence ministries are a sign, at least as of now, that the Chinese government is not willing to allow the situation to worsen through a war of words with New Delhi.To be sure, India has rejected China’s assertion that its troops had carried out illegal constructions across the LAC.“India is committed to the objective of maintenance of peace and tranquility in the border areas with China and our armed forces scrupulously follow the consensus reached by our leaders and the guidance provided. At the same time, we remain firm in our resolve to ensure India’s sovereignty and national security,” Srivastava said earlier this week.Chinese state-controlled media here also dismissed the US President’s proposal, which he had tweeted.“The latest dispute can be solved bilaterally by China and India. The two countries should keep alert on the US, which exploits every chance to create waves that jeopardise regional peace and order,” the nationalistic tabloid Global Times said in a comment piece.Titled “China, India don’t need US help on their frictions”, it said: “It seems Trump finally knows that China and India, the two largest Asian powers, share borders. Early this year, A Very Stable Genius, a book written by two Washington Post journalists, revealed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was shocked and concerned when Trump told him India and China did not share a border.”“Last year, India turned down Trump’s offer to ‘help’ and ‘mediate’ between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, an issue India stressed can only be discussed bilaterally. India perhaps has been aware of the US’ bad history of mediation in which the US made troubles rather than solved problems, and which turned bilateral disputes into multilateral ones,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-india-now-china-rejects-trump-s-offer-to-mediate-border-row-says-don-t-need-third-party-intervention/story-1P8iCmUEL72d082fiX8HsK.html
29-05-2020||World||In Donald Trump’s order to raise bar for social media giants, China is the ammo||US President Donald Trump on Thursday signed off on an executive order that seeks to restrict protection to social media companies and underlines the need to seek “transparency and accountability” from these platforms. The order is centered around the argument that social media companies that selectively remove or restrict access to content engage in editorial conduct and should not be shielded by limited liability protection extended to them for users’ posts.Trump, who has often complained about liberal-leaning Silicon Valley companies targeting conservatives by fact-checking them or removing their posts, issued the order days after Twitter started selective fact-checks of his posts and labeled two of them about mail-in voting “potentially misleading”.To make his point, Trump’s order also targeted China.These tech companies, he said, instead of censoring China for promoting aggression and disinformation had profited from it.“One United States company, for example, created a search engine for the Chinese Communist Party that would have blacklisted searches for “human rights,” hid data unfavorable to the Chinese Communist Party, and tracked users determined appropriate for surveillance. It also established research partnerships in China that provide direct benefits to the Chinese military,” the US President said. He did not name Google.Trump also referenced the social media campaign launched by Beijing after he held China responsible for the coronavirus pandemic and more.Companies had accepted advertisements paid for by the Chinese government that spread false information about its mass imprisonment of religious minorities. “They have also amplified China’s propaganda abroad, including by allowing Chinese government officials to use their platforms to spread misinformation regarding the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to undermine pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong,” his order said.White House officials, according to Bloomberg, complained that Twitter did not originally append fact checks to China Foreign Ministry Spokesman Lijan Zhao, who without evidence wrote that “it might be” the U.S. military that brought the coronavirus to China. Twitter has since added the fact-check link to his tweets.Trump later followed up on the China angle of his order, telling reporters that China could have stopped the coronavirus from stopping but did not. He has promised to have a dedicated briefing on China tomorrow.At his briefing, Trump said the choices that Twitter makes when it chooses to suppress, edit, blacklist, shadow, ban are editorial decisions, pure and simple and should be treated as such. They are editorial decisions.“In those moments, Twitter ceases to be a neutral public platform, and they become an editor with a viewpoint,” he asserted.His order quoted the Supreme Court that had compared social media sites to a modern public square where any citizen could say anything to make his or her voice heard. This is the reason why social media platforms were held to a lower accountability bar.But the platforms were not only selectively calling out users - or say people in a public square - but also taking money to promote access to false content.The US President has asked all government departments and agencies to review advertising and marketing spending on online platforms to “protect” federal taxpayer dollars from financing online platforms that restrict free speech.Trump also asked a Attorney General-led Working Group to initiate discussions with counterparts in the states that would look at the 16,000-plus complaints of online platforms censoring received from people by the White House’s Tech Bias Reporting tool launched in May 2019.This group would also collect material about algorithms to suppress content or users based on their political views and differential policies allowing for otherwise impermissible behavior committed by accounts linked to the Chinese Communist Party or other autocratic regimes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-donald-trump-s-order-to-raise-bar-for-social-media-giants-china-is-the-ammo/story-h24hdf5bIqHoyJwpzGjvCJ.html
29-05-2020||World||Attack on Taiwan an option to stop independence, top China general says||China will attack Taiwan if there is no other way of stopping it from becoming independent, one of the country’s most senior generals said on Friday, in a rhetorical escalation from China aimed at the democratic island Beijing claims as its own.Speaking at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People on the 15th anniversary of the Anti-Secession Law, Li Zuocheng, chief of the Joint Staff Department and member of the Central Military Commission, left the door open to using force.The 2005 law gives the country the legal basis for military action against Taiwan if it secedes or seems about to, making the narrow Taiwan Strait a potential military flashpoint. “If the possibility for peaceful reunification is lost, the people’s armed forces will, with the whole nation, including the people of Taiwan, take all necessary steps to resolutely smash any separatist plots or actions,” Li said.“We do not promise to abandon the use of force, and reserve the option to take all necessary measures, to stabilise and control the situation in the Taiwan Strait,” he added.Although China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, it is rare for a top, serving military officer to so explicitly make the threat in a public setting. The comments are especially striking amid international opprobrium over China passing new national security legislation for Chinese-run Hong Kong.Taiwan’s government denounced the comments, saying that threats of war were a violation of international law and that Taiwan has never been a part of the People’s Republic of China.“Taiwan’s people will never choose dictatorship nor bow to violence”, Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council said. “Force and unilateral decisions are not the way to resolve problems.”Li is one of China’s few senior officers with combat experience, having taken part in China’s ill-fated invasion of Vietnam in 1979.Taiwan is China’s most sensitive territorial issue. Beijing says it is a Chinese province, and has denounced the Trump administration’s support for the island.Li Zhanshu, the third-most-senior leader of China’s ruling Communist Party and head of China’s parliament, told the same event that non-peaceful means were an option of last resort.“As long as there is a slightest chance of a peaceful resolution, we will put in hundred times the effort,” Li said.However, he added: “We warn Taiwan’s pro-independence and separatist forces sternly, the path of Taiwan independence leads to a dead end; any challenge to this law will be severely punished”.Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by autocratic China. It has denounced China’s repeated military drills near the island and rejected China’s offer of a “one country, two systems” model of a high degree of autonomy.Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party won presidential and parliamentary elections by a landslide in January, vowing to stand up to Beijing.China is deeply suspicious of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, whom it accuses of being a separatist bent on declaring formal independence.

It also said that the death toll climbed to 1,317 after 57 people lost their lives in the last 24 hours, the country’s highest single-day increase since the outbreak began.The Sindh province continues to lead the country’s tally with 25,309 Covid-19 cases, followed by 22,964 in Punjab, 8,842 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 3,928 in Balochistan, 2,100 in Islamabad, 658 in Gilgit-Baltistan and 227 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The ministry said that 22,305 patients have been recovered so far from the virus.Addressing a high-level virtual event of the United Nations on Financing for Development in Era of Covid-19 and beyond, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Thursday that the coronavirus disease is a global problem and requires worldwide efforts to tackle it.He also said that the world cannot recover from the coronavirus pandemic until all the nations come together to find a holistic solution to the deadly disease.Appreciating the efforts made by G20 countries to provide debt relief to developing countries, Khan said that the developed world with 1.5 billion people has resources but the developing world with a population of six billion people is struggling.Like many other countries, Pakistan had also imposed a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus but it started easing it in phases earlier this month, which Khan had said is being done because the country’s cash-strapped economy cannot bear the burden anymore.The Pakistan Prime Minister had said that out of country’s 220 million population, almost 150 million are counted among the most vulnerable section, including daily wagers, weekly wagers, whose families are dependent on them and worse hit by the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-records-2-636-covid-19-cases-highest-single-day-fatalities-tally-crosses-64-000-mark/story-TmQmy3SwmyGQ7VxBvMCGBI.html
29-05-2020||World||Why US, Europe were hit harder by Covid-19? Scientists look at regional disparities, immune system||A new study has said that regional differences play a major role in mutating the strains of coronavirus and making it innately contagious as well as lethal in one part of the world than in another.The study has been conducted by Japanese researchers and reported by various Japanese media outlets.Researchers examined differences in genetics and immune system responses, separate virus strains and regional contrasts in obesity levels and general health, apart from the quick reaction time to the crisis in many countries of Asia.Giving example of China, where the outbreak started in December last year, the scientists said that the country reported less than 5,000 deaths since the outbreak began, which translates to three deaths per million inhabitants. Japan has around seven per million, Pakistan six, South Korea and Indonesia five, India three and Thailand fewer than one per million.They then said that there were about 100 deaths per million in Germany, about 180 in Canada, nearly 300 in the United States and more than 500 in Britain, Italy and Spain.“That means we need to take into consideration regional differences first, before analysing what policies and other factors are affecting the spread of infection in any given country,” said Akihiro Hisaka of China University’s Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences.Reacting to the research, Tatsuhiko Kodama of the University of Tokyo told Japanese media that preliminary studies show that Japanese people’s immune systems tend to react to the novel coronavirus “as though they had previous exposure”. He also noted that there are centuries of history of coronaviruses emerging from East Asia.Several studies had earlier suggested that heat and humidity can slow the spread of the virus. But such findings were squashed after equatorial countries like Ecuador and Brazil saw severe growth in infected cases and deaths linked to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-us-europe-were-hit-harder-by-covid-19-scientists-look-at-regional-disparities-immune-system/story-5PRVoDaGsRjS9Xn2H6MaSO.html
29-05-2020||World||US to announce ‘certain decisions’ on China on Friday: Trump||The US would announce “certain decisions” on China on Friday, President Donald Trump has said as he emphasised that Beijing should have stopped the coronavirus at the source.Led by the US, several countries in the world have blamed China for the spread of coronavirus and its failure to provide timely information about the disease, leading to the death of over three lakh people and causing an unprecedented economic crisis.Also read: The sharp dip in US-China tiesTrump has been pressing China to agree for an inquiry into the origin of the virus, including the allegation that it emerged from a bio-lab in the central Chinese city of Wuhan The disease has killed nearly 360,000 people globally, including 102,000 in America alone.Over 5.8 million people have been infected by the Covid-19 worldwide with 1.7 million in the US alone.“Tomorrow, we’re going to be having a press conference on China. So, we’ll be making certain decisions and we’ll be discussing them tomorrow,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday.“It’s a very sad situation. It should have never happened. China should have stopped it at the source, but they didn’t do that,” Trump said.Trump in the last several weeks has been very critical of China’s inability to control the spread of the novel coronavirus within its territory. He has so far not given any indication of the steps that he is contemplating taking against China.Trump had on May 14 threatened to “cut off the whole relationship” with China.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on May 16 had said that President Trump will decide on the future course of action on penalising China, a day after Trump said that he does not want to talk to his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping right now.However, China has rejected all US allegations of a cover up regarding the Covid-19 outbreak.Meanwhile, in a separate development, several US senators sent a letter to the United Nations permanent representatives for Estonia and France, the current and incoming president of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), in support of the US’ call for an immediate UNSC meeting on recent actions taken by the Chinese government to undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy.“In your nations’ capacities as the current and incoming president of the UNSC, we write to strongly support the USUN’s call for an immediate UNSC meeting on recent actions taken by the Chinese government to undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy and infringe on the rights and freedoms promised to the Hong Kong people,” the senators wrote in the letter.China last week introduced the draft of a controversial national security law in Hong Kong in its parliament to tighten Beijing’s control over the former British colony, in what could be the biggest blow to the territory’s autonomy and personal freedoms since 1997 when it came under Chinese rule.Hong Kong, an economic powerhouse, is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China. It has observed a “one country, two systems” policy since Britain returned sovereignty to China on July 1, 1997, which has allowed it certain freedoms the rest of China does not have.The US over the last few days has expressed concerns over the new Chinese law on Hong Kong and has indicated taking steps against it.“The People’s Republic of China’s actions with regard to Hong Kong are a clear violation of its binding international commitments, including the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, and undermine the ability for the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to remain in force in Hong Kong as guaranteed by Hong Kong’s Basic Law,” the members said.“These actions warrant the immediate attention of the UNSC. We hope in your capacities as the current and incoming President of the UNSC, you will support this call for a virtual meeting at the UNSC without delay,” they said in the letter.In another statement, a bipartisan group of Congressmen applauded the House passage of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 (S.3744).This bipartisan bill is an important step in countering the totalitarian Chinese government’s widespread and horrific human rights abuses in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), including the mass internment of over one million Uyghurs and other predominantly ethnic Turkic Muslims, as well as Beijing’s intimidation and threats against US citizens and legal permanent residents on American soil. S. 3744 now goes to President Trump for signature.“The Chinese Communist Party’s actions in Xinjiang are an affront to humanity and the CCP must pay a heavy price for these heinous crimes,” said Senator Cory Gardner.“The mass internment and forced labour of Uyghurs is one of the greatest ongoing tragedies of our time. With passage of this bill, the US Congress stated loud and clear that we will hold the CCP and its enablers responsible, pursuant to my Asia Reassurance Initiative Act and other relevant US laws,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-announce-certain-decisions-on-china-on-friday-trump/story-L6iPjoL8ILXJI5Xs9Z5ozN.html
29-05-2020||World||Hong Kong govt warns removing US special status is “double-edged sword”||Hong Kong’s government warned Washington that withdrawing its special US status, which has underpinned the city as a global financial hub, could be a “double-edged sword” and urged the United States to stop interfering in internal affairs.The statement came as US President Donald Trump is due to announce later on Friday his response to the Chinese parliament’s advancement of national security legislation for Hong Kong, which democracy activists and Western countries fear could erode the city’s freedoms.The former British colony enjoys a high degree of autonomy under a “one country, two systems” formula since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.“Any sanctions are a double-edged sword that will not only harm the interests of Hong Kong but also significantly those of the US,” the city’s government said late on Thursday.It added that from 2009 to 2018, the US trade surplus with Hong Kong was the biggest among all its trading partners, totalling $297 billion of merchandise and 1,300 US firms are based in the city.Beijing says the new legislation will tackle secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference in the city. It could see Chinese intelligence agencies set up bases there.The plan has ignited the first big protests in Hong Kong for months, as thousands of people took to the streets this week, prompting police to fire pepper pellets in the heart of the city’s financial district to disperse crowds.The US Department of State said in a report on Thursday it could “no longer certify that Hong Kong continues to warrant (differential) treatment” from Beijing.Trump’s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow warned that Hong Kong, which has enjoyed special privileges under US law based on its high degree of autonomy from Beijing, may now need to be treated like China on trade and other financial matters.In a separate statement on Friday, published in several local newspapers, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam urged “fellow citizens” to “join hands to pursue our dreams while putting aside our differences”.She said the legislation was needed because of a “terrorist threat” and because organisations advocating “independence and self-determination” have challenged the authority of Beijing and local governments and pleaded for foreign interference.The five demands of last-year’s pro-democracy protest movement included universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into police handling of the protests, but not independence. A minority of protesters waved “Hong Kong independence” flags.Independence is anathema for Beijing.The security legislation, along with a bill to criminalise disrespect for China’s national anthem, are seen by protesters as the latest attempt by Beijing to tighten its control on the city.The security legislation, expected to be enacted before September, was condemned also by Britain, Australia, Canada and others. Britain said it will give greater visa rights to British national overseas passport holders from Hong Kong unless China suspends its plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-govt-warns-removing-us-special-status-is-double-edged-sword/story-7SkK2jl2zpurXynJmFa4hK.html
29-05-2020||World||Donald Trump took two-week dose of hydroxychloroquine, feeling ‘absolutely great’: White House||US President Donald Trump is feeling “absolutely great” after taking a two-week dose of antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine and will take it again if he thinks he is exposed to the coronavirus, a top White House official has said.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate was first synthesised in 1946 and is in a class of medications historically used to treat and prevent malaria. It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, childhood arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here The drug is not FDA-approved for the treatment of Covid-19 but it has been identified as a possible treatment for the infection and the US government has requested its immediate availability.Trump has called hydroxychloroquine a “game-changer” drug in the fight against the coronavirus. “I went to him just before coming out here and I asked him that. And he said, ‘he’s feeling perfect’, he is ‘feeling absolutely great’ after taking this regimen. And, he would take it again if he thought that he was exposed,” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnaney said on Thursday when asked how the US president was feeling after taking the antimalarial drug. Many experts have underscored the prophylaxis use of hydroxychloroquine. One such paper by Tina Hesman Saey author at ScienceNews.org talks about nearly 200 clinical trials around the world, including 28 involving healthcare workers, she said. In fact, at Henry Ford Hospital in Michigan, 3,000 healthcare workers are taking it as part of a trial. And there’s some really excellent information there about the use of prophylaxis for this,” the press secretary said. Responding to questions, McEnany said that a number of doctors and researchers have been coming out in support of hydroxychloroquine. “It’s not specific to the President, these doctors. But they just talk in general about what they’ve seen. For instance, Sarah Lofgren, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis - they’re testing hydroxychloroquine there to prevent COVID-19. And she said, ‘When used alone, we’re not seeing major issues. Out of the thousands of patients, we’re not seeing things that some people are concerned about’,” she said.McEnany also said that it was always important to get a prescription from doctor if one wished to take hydroxychloroquine.“Doctors are the ones that need to be prescribing this,” she said.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  “But that being said, I think that some of the hyperbole around this drug that has been on the market for 65 years - been approved for use in three other maladies and has been approved for off-label use - when there’s a lot of hyperbole about this being unsafe - some of the things I’ve seen reported out there - are consequences, deterring people from being recruited into actual clinical trials,” McEnany said. “I have some quotes from a New York epidemiologist and others conducting trials, saying they’re having trouble recruiting people because some of the myths that are out there. So it’s important to note that this drug has been safely used by millions of people for a long time,” she said in response to a question. After Trump announced early this month that he was taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure against coronavirus, a number of Indian-American doctors have written to the Trump Campaign about the usefulness of this antimalaria drug in the fight against Covid-19.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know today Some of them even said that they had been taking the drug.“Hydroxychloroquine is a very safe drug used by millions all over the world over several decades,” American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI) president Dr Suresh Reddy said in a recent letter to Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee.“On a personal note, several of my friends including me, have been taking Hydroxychloroquine,” Reddy said.In a statement, Mason said Trump had taken unprecedented steps to respond to the coronavirus crisis.“He took swift action to shut down travel from where the virus originated – China,” he added.Also read: India most infected by Covid-19 among Asian countries, leaves Turkey behindObserving that the unprecedented global pandemic is testing every world leader, he said that nations were judging their leaders on a daily basis. “A pandemic was never a subject for any world leader to have to have a mastery over, yet Trump has a handle now on every facet related to the coronavirus,” Mason said. After Trump’‘s repeated touting of hydroxychloroquine as a “game changer” cure for the virus, the FDA issued an advisory warning that the drug has not been “shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing COVID-19.” The Trump Administration has bought millions of doses of hydroxychloroquine and stockpiled it. India, which is one of the major manufactures of the drug, has sent several millions of doses to the US as part of its humanitarian gesture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-took-two-week-dose-of-hydroxychloroquine-feeling-absolutely-great-white-house/story-JtKenweELFRGG4yYLVqREM.html
29-05-2020||World||Roche, Gilead to test drug cocktail against severe Covid-19||Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche said Thursday that it is planning to test whether a mix of its arthritis drug tocilizumab and Gilead’s antiviral drug remdesivir could treat severe cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) effectively.Roche said in a statement that it had joined forces with Gilead for a global phase III clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of using tocilizumab—sold under the brand names Actemra and RoAcemtra—combined with remdesivir in hospitalised patients with severe Covid-19 pneumonia.The clinical trial is due to begin in early June with approximately 450 patients participating in the United States, Canada and Europe, Roche said, adding that the randomised study would evaluate the drugs’ efficiency compared to a placebo.Remdesivir has shown promise in a completed study and a separate trial is under way on tocilizumab’s potential against the disease, but Roche said there were indications that mixing the two could be more effective.“We believe that combining an antiviral with an immune modulator could potentially be an effective approach to treating patients with severe disease,” Levi Garraway, Roche’s chief medical officer and head of global product development, said in a statement.“We’re pleased to partner with Gilead to determine whether combining these medicines could potentially help more patients during this pandemic,” he said.A large US study published last week showed that remdesivir, initially developed against Ebola, helped severely ill Covid-19 patients who required supplemental oxygen, and accelerated their recovery.The United States and Japan have already authorised emergency use of the drug, and Europe is considering following suit.An ongoing French study has meanwhile indicated that tocilizumab, commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, might help prevent extreme inflammation in people gravely ill with the novel coronavirus.Researchers believe the drug could help stave off a state of heightened immune response known as cytokine storms—where the reaction to a foreign body such as a disease or chemical creates acute inflammation.Roche said the final results of that trial were expected in the next few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/roche-gilead-to-test-drug-cocktail-against-severe-covid-19/story-AV5xq9oV6RbrS0rM5pYJcN.html

29-05-2020||World||US charges North Koreans, Chinese in $2.5B sanctions-busting scheme||The Justice Department has accused a network of North Korean and Chinese citizens of secretly advancing North Korea’s nuclear weapons program by channeling at least $2.5 billion in illicit payments through hundreds of front companies.The indictment, unsealed Thursday in Washington’s federal court, is believed to be the largest criminal enforcement action ever brought against North Korea.The 33 defendants include executives of North Korea’s state-owned Foreign Trade Bank, which in 2013 was added to a Treasury Department list of sanctioned institutions for transactions that facilitated the nuclear proliferation network, and cut off from the US financial system.According to the indictment, the bank officials — one of whom had served in North Korea’s primary intelligence bureau — set up branches in countries around the world, including Thailand, Russia and Kuwait, and used more than 250 front companies to process US dollar payments to further the country’s nuclear proliferation program.The defendants used a variety of tactics to cover their tracks, including coded conversations; listing false destinations and customers on contracts and invoices; and creating new front companies after the banks caught onto the association with North Korea, the indictment says. Banks were routinely tricked into processing transactions they wouldn’t have ordinarily done, according to prosecutors.Five of the defendants are Chinese citizens who operated covert branches in either China or Libya. Others who were charged include individuals who served at times as the bank’s president or vice president.“Through this indictment, the United States has signified its commitment to hampering North Korea’s ability to illegally access the US financial system and (to limiting) its ability to use proceeds from illicit actions to enhance its illegal WMD and ballistic missile programs,” acting US Attorney Michael Sherwin for the District of Columbia said in a statement.The US has frozen and seized about $63 million from the scheme since 2015, according to the indictment.The case was filed at a time of delicate relations between the US and North Korea. The rapprochement that President Donald Trump has tried to engineer over the past two years has stalled badly, with the last face-to-face meeting between senior officials from the two countries taking place in October in Stockholm.Apart from recent speculation over North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s health, which prompted public expressions of concern from Trump, the administration has been almost completely silent on North Korea. US officials say they remain eager to restart negotiations but have gotten no indication from the North that any resumption is imminent.The indictment also reflects ongoing concerns about sanctions violations related to North Korea. Last month, for instance, United Nations experts recommended blacklisting 14 vessels for violating sanctions against North Korea, accusing the country in a report of increasing illegal coal exports and imports of petroleum products and continuing with cyber attacks on financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges to gain illicit revenue.It was not immediately clear whether any of the defendants had lawyers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-charges-north-koreans-chinese-in-2-5b-sanctions-busting-scheme/story-Vpp6GPDIkQo2yCAaMv4iCM.html
29-05-2020||World||US joins G7 artificial intelligence group to counter China||The US has joined an international panel for setting ethical guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence. The Trump administration had earlier dismissed the idea.White House’s chief technology officer, Michael Kratsios, told The Associated Press on Thursday it is important to establish shared democratic principles as a counter to China’s record of “twisting technology” in ways that threaten civil liberties.“Chinese technology companies are attempting to shape international standards on facial recognition and surveillance at the United Nations,” he said.The Trump administration had been the lone holdout among leaders of the Group of Seven — the world’s wealthiest democracies — in setting up the Global Partnership on AI.The partnership launched Thursday after a virtual meeting between national technology ministers. It was nearly two years after the leaders of Canada and France announced they were forming a group to guide the responsible adoption of AI based on shared principles of “human rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation and economic growth.” The Trump administration objected to that approach, arguing that too much focus on regulation would hamper US innovation. But negotiations over the past year and changes to the group’s scope led the US to join, Kratsios said.“We worked very hard to make it clear that it would not be a standard-setting or policy-making body,” he said.US involvement is important because of the large role that American tech firms play globally and its historic advocacy for human rights, said Kay Mathiesen, an associate professor focused on computer ethics at Northeastern University in Boston.US tech companies such as Microsoft, Google and Apple are all concerned about what guidelines they should be following to use AI responsibly,” she said. “Given their global presence, the fact that the U.S. wasn’t involved does not mean that they would not end up having to follow any regulations developed by the rest of the G7.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-joins-g7-artificial-intelligence-group-to-counter-china/story-PoqSwKW2zOodwNjslhQ0fL.html

He is a great gentleman,” the president said.“Have a big conflict …India and China. Two countries with 1.4 billion people (each). Two countries with very powerful militaries. India is not happy and probably China is not happy,” he said when asked if he was worried about the border situation between India and China.“I can tell you; I did speak to Prime Minister Modi. He is not in a good mood about what is going on with China,” Trump said.A day earlier, the president offered to mediate between India and China.Trump on Wednesday said in a tweet that he was “ready, willing and able to mediate” between the two countries.Responding to a question on his tweet, Trump reiterated his offer, saying if called for help, “I would do that (mediate). If they thought it would help” about “mediate or arbitrate, I would do that,” he said. India on Wednesday said it was engaged with China to peacefully resolve the border row, in a carefully crafted reaction to Trump’s offer to arbitrate between the two Asian giants to settle their decades-old dispute. “We are engaged with the Chinese side to peacefully resolve it,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said, replying to a volley of questions at an online media briefing.While the Chinese Foreign Ministry is yet to react to Trump’s tweet which appears to have caught Beijing by surprise, an op-ed in the state-run Global Times said both countries did not need such a help from the US President. “The latest dispute can be solved bilaterally by China and India. The two countries should keep alert on the US, which exploits every chance to create waves that jeopardise regional peace and order,” it said.Also read: Donald Trump’s mediation tweet is part of growing anti-China juggernaut In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Wednesday that both China and India have proper mechanisms and communication channels to resolve the issues through dialogue and consultations.

29-05-2020||World||Trump signs order targeting social media giants’ legal protections||President Donald Trump signed an order Thursday seeking to strip social media giants like Twitter of legal immunity for content on their platforms in a move slammed by his critics as a legally dubious act of political revenge.The executive order calls on government regulators to evaluate if online platforms should be eligible for liability protection for content posted by their millions of users.If enforced, the action would upend decades of precedent and treat internet platforms as “publishers” potentially liable for user-generated content.Watch: Why US President Donald Trump is angry with TwitterTrump told reporters at the White House he acted because big tech firms “have had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences.”“We can’t let this continue to happen,” Trump said.The move comes a day after an angry tirade from the US leader against Twitter after the platform for the first time labelled two of his tweets, on the increasingly contentious topic of mail-in voting, with fact-check notices, calling them misleading.“In those moments, Twitter ceases to be a neutral public platform and they become an editor with a viewpoint,” Trump said.“And I think we can say that about others also, whether you’re looking at Google, whether you’re looking at Facebook, perhaps others.”‘President’s speech police’Critics said however Trump has no authority to regulate private internet operators or change the law known as Section 230 which backers say has allowed online platforms like Facebook and Twitter to flourish.The American Civil Liberties Union called Trump’s order “a blatant and unconstitutional threat to punish social media companies that displease the president.”Eric Goldman, director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said the order was “more about political theater than about changing the law.”The order “is not legally supportable -- it flies in the face of more than 900 court decisions,” Goldman said.The White House seeks to sidestep the provisions giving internet firms immunity by treating them as publishers operating in part of a “public square.”“Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see,” the executive order said.While the Trump order would not prevent platforms from moderating content, it could open them up to a flood of lawsuits from anyone who claims to be harmed by content posted online.Critics said the action represents a dangerous effort by the government to regulate online speech.“Social media can be frustrating. But an Executive Order that would turn the FCC into the President’s speech police is not the answer,” said Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic member of Federal Communications Commission, one of the agencies tasked with enforcing the executive order.Matt Schruers, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, a trade group, warned that “retaliation against the private sector for fact-checking leadership is what we expect from foreign autocracies, not the United States.”Wading into quagmireInternet firms have denied Trump’s claims of bias, and point to his massive social media following. But the president’s move plays into his narrative ahead of his difficult November reelection battle that liberal forces are trying to censor Republicans.Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican and fierce critic of social media, said that if online firms “are going to editorialize and censor and act like traditional publishers, they should be treated like traditional publishers and stop receiving the special carve out from the federal government.”But Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, one of the authors of the 1996 law, called Trump’s order a “plainly illegal” political ploy.“Trump is desperately trying to steal for himself the power of the courts and Congress to rewrite decades of settled law around Section 230. All for the ability to spread lies,” Wyden said.Fact check furyA wider debate has long been underway on the power that social media companies wield and what responsibility they bear for posts that are misleading or hurtful.Internet services like Twitter and Facebook have been struggling to root out misinformation, while at the same time keeping their platforms open to users.The massive amount of unverified content in circulation has prompted a rise in fact-checking operations, including a vast Facebook effort in which AFP plays a role.After long resisting calls to censure Trump over his frequent factually inaccurate posts, Twitter on Tuesday flagged the president for the first time for making false claims.Trump had tweeted -- without any evidence -- that more mail-in voting would lead to what he called a “Rigged Election” this November.Some analysts claimed the president’s arguments against Twitter had turned upside down the interpretation of the constitution’s First Amendment, designed to prevent the government from limiting free expression.“The First Amendment applies to the government not to private actors like Twitter,” wrote law professors Laurence Tribe of Harvard and Joshua Geltzer of Georgetown University in the Washington Post.“Trump is wrong on the law, but this time he’s even more wrong than usual.

The review, published in the journal Gastroenterology, could provide diagnostic hint for clinicians who suspect their patients might have the deadly disease. “Earlier studies didn’t note this symptom, and that was probably because of the severity of other symptoms like cough, fever and trouble breathing,” said Muhammad Aziz, from the University of Toledo in the US. “We were beginning to note that altered or lost sense of taste were also present, not just here and there, but in a significant proportion,” Aziz said. The research team analysed data from five studies conducted between mid-January and the end of March. Of the 817 patients studied, 49.8 per cent experienced changes to their sense of taste, according to the study. The researchers noted that the true prevalence could be even higher because some of the studies were based on reviews of patient charts, which may not have noted every symptom. “We propose that this symptom should be one of the screening symptoms in addition to the fever, shortness of breath and productive cough. Not just for suspected Covid-19 patients, but also for the general population to identify healthy carriers of the virus,” Aziz said. Previous studies have found that a significant number of people who have Covid-19 don’t know they have been infected, and may be spreading the disease. The researchers suspect an altered sense of taste is more prevalent in patients with minor symptoms. However, they said more studies are needed to validate that suspicion. The researchers said changes in an individual’s sense of taste could be a valuable way to identify carriers who are otherwise mostly asymptomatic. They theorise that the reason behind loss of taste could be the ability of the virus to bind to what’s known as the ACE-2 receptor, which is expressed in epithelial cells on the tongue and mouth. The researchers said the drip of new information shows the need for more scientists to dig into the impacts of Covid-19. “A lot of things are being missed, which is why I think researchers from every field should try to look into this and see if it’s affecting their specialty in one way or another,” Aziz added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/50-of-people-infected-with-covid-may-experience-altered-sense-of-taste-study/story-TktPrxQXBrT70UnDYmnhjN.html

Here’s why||The Pentagon has released three declassified videos, previously released by a private company, that show US navy pilots encountering what appear to be unidentified flying objects (UFOs).The US department of defense (DOD) said it has authorised the release of three videos, one taken in November 2004 and the other two in January 2015, “which have been circulating in the public domain after unauthorised releases in 2007 and 2017”.“DOD is releasing the videos in order to clear up any misconceptions by the public on whether or not the footage that has been circulating was real, or whether or not there is more to the videos. The aerial phenomena observed in the videos remain characterized as “unidentified”,” a statement on its website said.“After a thorough review, the department has determined that the authorized release of these unclassified videos does not reveal any sensitive capabilities or systems, and does not impinge on any subsequent investigations of military air space incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena,” the statement said.Also Watch | After US warships’ harassment, Pentagon officials call Iran’s satellite launch ‘malign behavior’ The three videos, whose veracity was confirmed by the Pentagon in 2019, show what the pilots saw during training flights in 2004—when they encountered an object 40 feet long hovering about 50 feet above the water—and in 2015. Two of the videos, published by the New York Times in 2017, show fast-moving oblong objects racing through the sky and a pilot, in one video yelling, “Look at that thing, dude. It’s rotating!”The other video was released by the To the Stars Academy of Arts & Science group, a media and private science organisation, in 2018. To The Stars Academy of Arts & Sciences, co-founded by former Blink-182 musician Tom DeLonge, says it studies information about unidentified aerial phenomena.The Pentagon has studied recordings of aerial encounters with unidentified objects before as part of a classified program that was launched at the behest of former Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. The program was shuttered in 2012.“I’m glad the Pentagon is finally releasing this footage, but it only scratches the surface of research and materials available. The U.S. needs to take a serious, scientific look at this and any potential national security implications. The American people deserve to be informed,” Reid tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-releases-3-ufo-videos-officially-here-s-why/story-rOyI5pMK2MddKR47c0GVvI.html
29-05-2020||India||North Bengal hospital refuses to test samples sent by Sikkim due to spike in Covid-19 cases||The Himalayan state of Sikkim alleged on Friday that the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital (NBMCH) in Siliguri town, West Bengal government’s biggest hospital in the region, has refused to test swab samples it sends for Covid-19 tests.NBMCH had been regularly testing swab samples sent from Sikkim where only one citizen was infected so far. Though Sikkim carries out the Truenat-Beta-CoV test, samples were being sent to NBMCH for a second confirmation.Pempa Bhutia, health secretary of Sikkim, said, “Eighty-five samples were returned by NBMCH on Thursday while 750 samples sent earlier are yet to be tested.”Sikkim stopped sending samples from May 19. Officials in Sikkim said NBMCH authorities told them that the hospital was carrying out more tests than before since the number of cases in Bengal has gone up.Sikkim’s health minister Mani Kumar Sharma said, “We understand the pressure being faced by NBMCH. We are hopeful that the samples lying there will be tested even if the process may be delayed.”Praloy Acharjee, chief medical officer of health, Darjeeling district, said, “We are augmenting the testing capacity at NBMCH. We will, however, test samples from Sikkim that are marked urgent.” NBMCH’s Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory is testing up to 1,500 swab samples a day now. It receives more than 2,000 samples a day from different parts of north Bengal. The number of Covid-19 cases is rising fast in the region. Four people tested Covid-19 positive in the Darjeeling hills on Friday.An NBMCH doctor, who did not want to be quoted, said, “The reason for refusing samples from Sikkim is the pressure the hospital is facing due to increased testing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/north-bengal-hospital-refuses-to-test-samples-sent-by-sikkim-due-to-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-ZhEusVndHHjHofp2LW9RwI.html

In the past, India has usually rejected such criticism by members of the European Parliament as interference in its internal affairs.The European Parliament’s subcommittee on human rights is a body that monitors human rights developments across the globe and advocates in favour of the respect for fundamental rights.“It is in this context that we are closely following the protection of human rights defenders in India and wish to express serious concerns about the recent arrests of Anand Teltumbde and Gautam Navlakha by the National Investigative Agency,” Arena wrote in her letter.“It is particularly alarming to note that human rights defenders cannot conduct advocacy activities, notably in favour of India’s poorest and most marginalized communities, without becoming subject to intimidation and harassment, but equally worrying is the fact that terrorism charges, including under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), are used to silence them,” she added.The European Parliament had also “noticed that various forms of legitimate peaceful protests against laws, policies and governmental actions, including the Citizenship Amendment Act, have been portrayed as terrorist activities under this legislation, resulting in a number of arrests under this umbrella. This is notably the case for human rights activists such as Safoora Zargar, Gulfisha Fatima, Khalid Saifi, Meeran Haider, Shifa-Ur-Rehman, Dr Kafeel Khan, Asif Iqbal and Sharjeel Imam who were recently arrested by the Police,” the letter said.Arena further wrote: “Consequently, we strongly believe that measures should be urgently taken to stop impeding and criminalising the work of human rights defenders by means of overly broad national security legislation and to respect their freedoms of association and expression.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/european-parliament-s-panel-on-human-rights-expresses-concern-at-arrest-of-indian-activists/story-1S7qFoLX92iiA5zk9si7VI.html
29-05-2020||India||Mamata govt allows full strength at jute mills within hours of PMO’s letter||A letter from the office of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday morning played a key role in persuading West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee to let jute mills in the state operate with full workforce from June 1.Banerjee made the announcement around 5 pm on Friday afternoon, hours after Bhaskar Khulbe, advisor to PM Modi, shot the letter to chief secretary Rajiva Sinha. HT is aware of the contents of the letter.“I would request you to kindly consider assisting the jute mills in reaching the assured production of 10,000 bales per day as early as possible and definitely by June 15. We shall appreciate your feedback by June 4 to enable us to further review the matter on June 8,” said the letter. State government officials did not want to comment on the letter.Since April, the Centre has been urging the Bengal government to direct jute mills to resume operation in view of the shortage in supply of packaging materials. In a earlier letter, the Centre said, “Procurement operations of foodgrain, for which the availability of packaging material like jute bales are immensely required by major procuring states like Punjab, Harayana, Uttar Pradesh and Madya Pradesh where procurement operations will begin from April and peak season is for only two-three weeks only.”On April 5, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao requested the Prime Minister to open jute bag manufacturing units in Bengal and ensure transportation of jute bags through special goods trains to his state. Rao told Modi that there was a severe scarcity of bags and Telangana needed 20 crore jute bags to procure paddy.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe Bengal government initially allowed some mills to start production with 15 per cent workers and increased the number to 50 per cent in phases. Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA), the apex business chamber for India’s jute industry, however said that with such a limited workforce it was not possible to meet the demand for jute bags across India.“You are well aware that I have made a request to the Hon’ble Chief Minister for allowing IJMA to deploy full workforce in the 59 functional mills of West Bengal so that they are able to attain the daily production capacity of 10,000 bales per day by June 15, 2000. She had kindly agreed to consider their request with due empathy,” Khulbe wrote to Sinha on Friday.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“IJMA has also appealed to you to allow them to operate at full strength, committing to abide by the social distancing and safety guidelines and mobilizing their workforce immediately,” Khulbe wrote.The letter said that the inability of the jute mills to meet the requirement would not only be detrimental to the interest of jute farmers and industrial workers in Bengal but also dilute the purpose behind mandatory use of jute which is environment friendly. The government’s decision to allow mills to operate with full workforce was welcomed by the industry. “We welcome the development. There is huge scarcity of jute bags in several states. It is good that Mamata Banerjee took the decision,” said R K Poddar, a senior IJMA member.Incidentally, the jute industry has suffered a nationwide loss of Rs 1,250 crore during the lockdown.“The jute Industry is grappling for survival after being in lockdown for over one and a half months now. Already 1.5 lakh metric tonnes of production of jute goods has been lost, estimated at Rs1,250 crores. With the cash flows drying up, jute mill companies are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet,” IJMA said in a statement on May 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-govt-allows-full-strength-at-jute-mills-within-hours-of-pmo-s-letter/story-HKVOuztahLybKh9GLoHwgK.html

The agency had sent a Letter of Request to Swiss Confederation to restrain his Swiss bank accounts and ensure that Saxena did not transfer or dispose-off the suspected proceeds of crime.The accused-turn-approver in AgustaWestland scam, Saxena was deported to India from the UAE on January 31 last year and arrested under money laundering act for routing money belonging to several accused.ED has claimed that Saxena is a ‘hawala operator’ and accommodation entry provider who runs the accommodation entry business in Dubai through numerous companies known as Matrix Group companies and has laundered proceeds of crime in the cases of AgustaWestland scam, or VVIP chopper scam.Saxena is also named as accused for assisting Ratul Puri, nephew of former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath, in money laundering in the VVIP chopper scam as well as a separate case against Moser Baer India Ltd related to bank fraud. “Rajiv Saxena created structures for laundering proceeds of crime generated by accused of both cases either for the kickbacks in AgustaWestland case or defrauding banks by mis-utilising the loans given to Moser BaerThe agency has lately been trying to get his approver status revoked claiming that he misled the investigators and withheld crucial information. However, a Delhi court has refused to revoke his approver status, which is being challenged by the agency in Delhi high court.“Rajiv Saxena manages the proceeds of crime and tainted funds of many high profile and High Net worth Individuals (HNIs). He has admitted to laundering the proceeds of crime not only of the AgustaWestland deal but also various other defence deals. The proceeds of crime have also been transferred to the personal accounts of Rajiv Saxena and his wife Shivani Saxena (also an accused in AgustaWestland case),” the ED press release stated.In the Moser Baer case, the ED said, the proceeds of crime belonging to Deepak Puri (father of Ratul Puri) amounting to USD 16.33 million were also managed by Saxena.“From the analysis of digital evidences and accounts of the Puri family maintained by Rajiv Saxena, it has been revealed that the amount of USD 16.33 million is proceeds of crime in the hands of Rajiv Saxena belonging to Deepak Puri and is parked in the accounts of companies of Matrix Group. Similarly, proceeds of crime belonging to Ratul Puri and transferred to Rajiv Saxena from an undisclosed foreign entity have also been attached,” said the ED.Saxena’s lawyer R K Handoo said, “What’s happening is very wrong and is harassment of Rajiv Saxena by the agency. He was made an approver and now the agency is making these claims. Won’t the statement given by him against any person become null and void in that case?”Puri’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal refused to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-attaches-dubai-villa-5-swiss-bank-accounts-of-agustawestland-scam-accused-rajiv-saxena/story-5X3yqR6kIUNMNRJfUV3jzH.html
29-05-2020||India||UN Secretary General honours Indian Army Major Suman Gawani||UN chief Antonio Guterres on Friday honoured peacekeepers Major Suman Gawani from India and Commander Carla Monteiro de Castro Araujo from Brazil with the 2019 UN Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award, saying their “inspiring work” promotes equality in the forces. Secretary General Guterres bestowed the award to Gawani and Araujo in a virtual ceremony, commemorating the International Day of Peacekeepers. This is the first year the prestigious award has gone to a peacekeeper from India. Military Observer Gawani has recently completed an assignment in South Sudan. Araujo is working in the United Nations’ Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic. Guterres underscored the essential role played by women peacekeepers for the success of UN peace operations. He said Gawani and Araujo’s “inspiring work has made a remarkable difference in promoting gender equality and empowering local women and your own colleagues.” “Your contributions are proof that women peacekeepers are vital to peace and security everywhere,” the UN secretary general said. Guterres said during her deployment with the UN Mission in South Sudan, Gawani mentored more than 230 Military Observers on conflict-related sexual violence and ensured the presence of women military observers in each of the mission’s team sites. She also trained the South Sudanese government forces and helped them launch their action plan on conflict-related sexual violence. Guterres also paid tribute to the military, police and civilian personnel who laid down their lives in the line of duty. Four Indian peacekeepers and a civilian personnel were among the 83 military, police and civilian personnel who were honoured posthumously with the prestigious Dag Hammarskjöld Medal for their courage and sacrifice in the line of duty. Major Ravi Inder Singh Sandhu and Sergeant Lal Manotra Tarsem, who served with the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS); Sergeant Ramesh Singh with the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL); Private Johnsion Beck with the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) and Edward Agapito Pinto, who served in a civilian capacity with the UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) posthumously received the medals in the virtual ceremony. The year 2020 marks the 20th anniversary of Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. The theme for the International Day of UN Peacekeepers this year is ‘Women in Peacekeeping: A Key to Peace.’ Guterres, who has been a staunch advocate for increasing the participation of women in UN peacekeeping, said with each passing day women peacekeepers help improve all aspects of peace operations and performance -- better access to local communities, prevent and reduce conflict, serve as role models for peers and others. “In addition, we have seen that our operations are better able to build trust with those in need of protection when their staffing reflects the communities in which they serve. This is another reason why increasing the number of women in peacekeeping is so crucial,” Guterres said, adding that peacekeeping is more effective for everyone when “we have more women peacekeepers at all levels, including in decision-making.” “We will continue to do everything we can, including with our troop and police contributors, to reach this goal,” he said India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti, in his message on Peacekeepers Day, said Gawani “epitomises, in many ways, the rich values of Indian peacekeepers.” Tirumurti honoured India’s brave men and women who have served as peacekeepers selflessly in foreign lands to preserve international peace and security. “Indian peacekeepers have been at the forefront of this effort. They have been widely admired for their bravery, professionalism and selfless service. But India’s long standing UN peacekeeping contribution has not come without cost. India has lost more peacekeepers than any other member state of the United Nations,” he said, in a video message. Over the last 70 years, more than 160 Indian military, police and civilian personnel have lost their lives while serving in the UN missions around the world. With the world battling the COVID-19 pandemic, Guterres said UN peacekeepers continue to protect vulnerable local populations, support dialogue and implement their mandates while fighting coronavirus. “They are doing everything they can to be an integral part of the solution to this crisis while keeping themselves -- and the communities they serve safe. But the virus is not the only threat that our peacekeepers face. Hostile acts, improvised explosive devices, accidents and diseases continue to take a heavy toll,” he said, as he paid tribute to the 83 military, police and civilian personnel from 39 countries who lost their lives last year serving in the UN peace operations. India is the fifth largest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN Peacekeeping. It currently contributes more than 5,400 military and police personnel to the UN peacekeeping operations in Abyei, Cyprus, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lebanon, the Middle East, Sudan, South Sudan and Western Sahara as well as one expert to the UN Assistance Mission in Somalia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-secretary-general-honours-indian-army-major-suman-gawani/story-OoxyUWAR9itqkFdvqkEq9M.html

29-05-2020||India||Jagan’s first year as Andhra chief minister marked by welfare and vengeance, say experts||YSR Congress party president and Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy will be completing one year in office on Saturday, a period in which he has earned both bouquets and brickbats.A slew of welfare schemes implemented by Jagan has by and large consolidated his vote bank at the grassroots level and fetched him a lot of goodwill. The establishment of village secretariats to bring the administration to the villages and the appointment of over three lakh village volunteers were landmarks that helped the government directly deliver the benefits of various schemes, be it pensions or ration, to the beneficiaries at their doorsteps.His entire focus during the last one year was on delivering the promises made during his marathon 3,600-km long padayatra in the run-up to the general elections. “He has done tremendous social engineering in the implementation of his manifesto in the name of Navaratnas (nine jewels), so that every vulnerable section of the society that forms his vote bank benefitted from his schemes,” political analyst and Osmania University professor K Nageshwar said.He pointed out that schemes like Amma Vodi, enhanced pensions and fee reimbursement had won him a lot of support from the people. “Even in the formation of his cabinet and filling up of various nominated posts, Jagan had followed this social engineering – providing 50 per cent of the posts to SCs, STs, OBCs, minorities and women,” Nageshwar said.However, Jagan’s acts of vengeance against his political rivals, confrontation with constitutional systems and a host of other controversial decisions taken without proper homework, reflected his inexperience in administration and incurred the wrath of the judiciary.For a man, who led his party to victory with a landslide majority – 151 out of 175 state assembly seats and 22 out of 25 Lok Sabha seats with nearly 50 per cent vote share, it should have been a smooth sailing in the administration.But from the day one, Jagan’s action allowed an impression to gain ground that he was vengeful towards opposition Telugu Desam Party in general and his bête noire N Chandrababu Naidu in particular, who, he believed was responsible for his imprisonment for 16 months between 2012 and 2013 in the alleged illegal assets case.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesIn his first public speech minutes after being sworn-in as the chief minister, Jagan made his intentions clear: undo whatever his predecessor had done. So, he announced that all the ongoing works taken up by the Naidu government would be stopped immediately.As a result, several projects worth thousands of crores, including works on Amaravati capital city and Polavaram major irrigation project, had come to a halt for several months. Many of the projects like Amaravati core capital works by Singapore Consortium, Machilipatnam Port, Krishnapatnam Port SEZ, Convention Centre by Lulu group at Visakhapatnam, Adani group’s data centre at Viskahapatnam etc have been shelved.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The Jagan government claimed to have saved a few hundreds of crores in the name of “reverse tendering” for projects like Polavaram and Veligonda, but the projects are yet to take off in full swing and the cost overrun due to the delay in projects may turn out to be much more than what has been saved.“Right from the beginning, Jagan has been adopting a destructive and vengeful attitude, which was evident from the demolition of convention hall Praja Vedika. Reducing the security cover for Naidu, slapping a demolition notice on his riverfront residence near Vijayawada or foiling an opposition protest rally at Atmakur in Palnadu region and targeting individual TDP leaders by destroying their financial roots, were some of the examples of Jagan’s vendetta politics,” alleged TDP official spokesperson Panchurmarthi Anuradha.Jagan ordered several inquiries alleging insider trading in the land acquisition for Amaravati, but nothing has been proved till date, she pointed out.The decision to shift the administrative capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam has been one of the many controversial decisions taken by Jagan and thousands of farmers who had given away 34,000 acres of lands for the capital have been agitating against the move, but the chief minister is unmoved.Besides, several controversial decisions like the review of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) signed during the previous TDP regime with solar and wind power producers, introduction of English medium in government schools, abolition of legislative council just for referring the three-capitals bills to the select committee, removal of state election commissioner by promulgating ordinance and painting of government buildings with YSRC party colours have come under the scanner of judiciary.“While there is no doubt that Jagan has been able to fulfill most of the promises he made for the poor people by taking up welfare programmes, there has been not a single industry or infrastructure project worth naming during the last one year. Welfare and development are like two wheels of the cart, but the Jagan government is totally imbalanced due to the neglect of developmental programmes,” observes political analyst Srinivas Rao Manchala.However, the YSRC says it has been an eventful year for the government. “We have been able to provide four lakh jobs in village and ward secretariats within four months of taking the oath,” Jagan claimed, while addressing the beneficiaries of his schemes through a video conference on Friday.“The system has been so effective that in the times of coronavirus, three rounds of household surveys were held and the pension, ration, rice and dal were provided by the social delivery system of village and ward volunteers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-s-first-year-as-andhra-chief-minister-marked-by-welfare-and-vengeance-say-experts/story-bgroDTkyh1nYtePHNQePtL.html
29-05-2020||India||Karnataka sees biggest single-day spike with 248 new Covid-19 cases||With 248 new Covid-19 positive cases being registered on Friday, Karnataka again witnessed its biggest single-day spike in coronavirus cases. Interestingly, of the 248 new cases, 227 have a history of inter-state travel. On Thursday, the state government had appealed to the union civil aviation ministry to reduce the number of incoming flights into the state – especially from coronavirus hotspots like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh - so as to ease the pressure on the institutional quarantine mechanism in the state.This biggest single-day spike of cases takes the total Covid-19 positive cases in the state to 2,781 of which 1,837 are active cases and 894 people have been discharged. On Friday, a 50-year-old woman from Chikkaballapura who had tested positive for Covid-19 passed away at a designated hospital in Bangalore, bringing the total number of deaths due to the virus, in the state to 48.A health and family welfare department official who did not want to be identified – as he is not authorized to speak to the media—said, “Returnees from Maharashtra constitute nearly 85% of the new cases apart from a few others from Gujarat and Rajasthan. Local transmission is very low amounting to almost zero. This is why we requested the Centre to reduce incoming flights to the state and barred even road traffic from coming in from some of the neighbouring hotspots.”What has been a greater concern for the government has been that it is interior districts like Mandya, Yadgiri, Kalburgi, Hassan and Raichur which are seeing the majority of new cases. “The health infrastructure in those districts is not as robust as those in say Bangalore, Mysore or even a Dakshin Kannada which is the cause of worry as, if there is a further sharp increase then there might be a tremendous strain on our resources there,” the official quoted above added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-sees-biggest-single-day-spike-with-248-new-covid-19-cases/story-pvxxFMAxeKxUhZTi4Bm6NK.html

29-05-2020||India||Lockdown 5: Mamata allows pvt offices to work with 100% staff from June 8; says nothing on local train||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday announced that all private offices can operate in the state with cent per cent workforce and govt offices with 70 % workforce from June 8. The jute mills and tea industry, however, are allowed to summon full staff strength from June 1, when all religious places will also have the permission to open provided they do not let more than 10 persons congregate at a time.“Jute and tea industries will be allowed to operate with 100% workforce from June 1. From June 8, all government and private offices can operate with their full workforce,” Banerjee said at the state secretariat on Friday.However, she later released another statement to clarify that the staff strength in government offices will only be allowed up to 70%. “With multiple crises in the state, we have decided to increase State Government workforce capacity from 50% to 70%. Continuation of relief & restoration work is one of the top priorities & this workforce increase will ensure that public services are uninterrupted and unhindered,” she announced on social media later on Friday. The private sector, she said should judiciously decide on the staff complement to ensure everyone’s safety. “In the Private sector, I urge all to stay safe, work indoors as much as possible and to the best of their abilities. Prerogative lies with the respective managements of private entities to decide on workforce capacity & act accordingly,” Banerjee added. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesHer decision to allow private offices to function with full workforce without clarifying whether local trains and metro rail will resume operations, created confusion among the office goers.“If local trains do not ply, how would I reach office?” asked Samir Biswas, a resident of Serampore in Hooghly district, about 30 km from Kolkata, who works at a private firm in central Kolkata.Some netizens raised the question on social media and some also commented on Mamata Banerjee’s Facebook page. There are many who daily travel for work to Kolkata from distant districts of Nadia and Burdwan, covering over 100 kilometers one way.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19According to CM Banerjee, “Government buses are plying with 20 passengers. Auto-rickshaws and taxis have been allowed to ply with two passengers. Whether more passengers could be allowed on buses, needs to be considered.”Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national secretary Rahul Sinha said the chief minister was taking decisions without planning. Party state unit president Dilip Ghosh said, “The private busses have said they cannot operate with 20 passengers without increased fare. The government flatly refused any increase in fare. So, the private buses are not on the streets. I wonder how people are going to reach the office.”In another important decision, she allowed the opening of religious places from June 1 while taking a dig at the Indian railways’ handling of the Shramik specials during the pandemic.“Since the Centre is allowing huge gatherings in Shramik Special trains, not even leaving the middle berths empty, there is no reason why religious places should not be opened with restrictions. However, no religious gathering or festival would be allowed. Only 10 persons can gather at a religious place at any given time.”In further potshots at the railways, Banerjee staunchly disapproved of its decision to reopen middle berths for occupancy in Shramik specials encouraging crowding. “I wonder whether they mean to run Shramik Special trains or corona special trains,” the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-5-mamata-allows-all-offices-to-work-with-100-staff-from-june-8-says-nothing-on-local-train/story-RfTrpqJgTVRz8qiCSu8KzO.html

According to the National Center for Seismology, the first quake of medium intensity one of 4.5 magnitude, hit the Haryana city at 9.08 pm at a depth of 5 km.The epicentre of the earthquake is about 50 km from Delhi.The second quake was of lower intensity of magnitude 2.9 and occurred at the same location at 10 pm., the NCS said.There were no immediate reports of any loss of life or property. The earthquakes reported on Friday evening, like the last few quakes felt in Delhi and adjoining areas, were shallow quakes which often lead to greater damage than more powerful deep ones.The quakes in Rohtak were assessed to have occurred at a depth of 5 km.This was the fourth quake in or around Delhi this month.A 2.5 magnitude earthquake with its epicentre in Faridabad district was recorded by the National Centre for Seismology at 4.24 pm on Thursday evening. There was another mild quake on May 15 measured to be of 2.2 magnitude with its epicentre at 9 km from central Delhi.On May 10, people in Delhi and nearby areas felt tremors when a 3.4 magnitude earthquake occurred with its epicentre in Sonia Vihar.Two earthquakes were also reported on two consecutive days in Delhi last month.Seismologists say it is not unusual for the epicentre of these relatively small earthquakes to be in Delhi and neighbouring Haryana, seismologists said.Also, a larger proportion of people have been feeling the earthquake because most people are at home and there is far less noise associated with traffic movement due to the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown.Here is how the Twitter reacted to the news:  Earthquake of Magnitude 4.6 and Depth 3.3km strikes near 16km East-SouthEast of Rohtak, Haryana.#Earthquake https://t.co/tVXaD6Aaxn pic.twitter.com/M3i9HBkY8B The epicentre was Rohtak, depth 3 km, Richter Scale was 4.6 #Earthquake #Earthquake tremors felt in Delhi and adjoining states.We pray for everyone's safety.2020 just keeps adding new challenges each day.Stay strong! Its high time to help each other instead of abusing and fighting.#earthquake pic.twitter.com/PqS2SiD7qK Delhi falls on Sunatra Fault Line, hence it is more prone to such tectonic vibrations.

Away from the shoots of daily soaps, the actor is spending quality time with her family. Keeping up her creative quotient Amarpali recently shot a video with husband and actor Yash Sinha. Interestingly, they shot the entire video during the lockdown phase. The duo donned multiple hats for the shoot and even did the job of a director and a DOP for the video.Talking over phone, the ‘Qubool Hai’ actor said, “My show ‘Bahu Begum’ got wrapped in December and I finished the shoot for ‘Tujse Hai Rabta’ by January end. I have given audition for some shows but then the lockdown happened so everything for now is on hold. Let’s see when the projects restart and we will be back on sets.”Amarpali feels household work is meant to be shared, “We live in a joint family of eight. Besides, we have a cook and a help staying with us so nothing much changed for us. Yes, two other helps who used to visit us daily have stopped. My in-laws don’t let me do much household chores so maximum of time is devoted to my four-year-old son Kabir. But then we are there to help each other any which way.”During the period she started picking up kathak again. “I have restarted my kathak practice. There had been a long gap in between so I started training with online help. To be in the industry, you need to keep on reinventing yourself and this period has given everyone this opportunity.”Telling more about the making of the video, she said, “The close-ups were shot much easily but the real challenge was when both of us have to share the frame. So, for two days, we took help of our cook Ashok for shoot. Then we used tripod and some desi-methods for the shoot. The lighting was also done with the available resources. Since, we don’t have yellow bulbs in our house so we covered the white ones with yellow towels to achieve the required light. The dresses too were from our personal wardrobe based on the theme of white. All in all the week-long shoot was truly a fun experience. I feel this lockdown has brought out our creative side well,” she shared.The song, ‘Teri Bindiya’ has been sung by Amitabh Narain. “The big question was how to choreograph it? So, we took help of choreographer Chirag Zaveri. I have worked with him in ‘Teen Bahuraaniyaan’ and it was really sweet of him to shoot a dummy sequence with his wife to guide us through the sequence. That’s how everything fell into place. With so much misery around with this video we hope to bring some joy in lives of our fans.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lockdown-brought-out-our-creative-side/story-jyIjVSFl9l7uLgEBdMOgbJ.html

My grandmother is and has been my superpower as she is an amazing-woman of great learning and education, besides my maternal aunts and uncles too are there in city of nawabs. And I am looking forward to meet them soon.”After taking a sabbatical from films in 2012, she made a comeback with film ‘Season’s Greeting’ which had Lillete Dubey as her mother. “To fulfil my mother’s last wish, I will continue doing cinema. Last year, before she passed away, she told me that acting was my calling and I should always pursue it. I took a break from films as I was only getting to play glamorous characters where as I was looking for meaningful roles and fine scripts. So when I did get to do something so meaningful I just had to say yes.” It was then she got this offer. “I took up this project as it was a tribute to Ritupurno Ghosh and beautiful story, relation between mother and daughter; it has lyrics of Gurudev Rabindra Nath Tagore and the film revolves around the cause I am closely associated with that is LGBT rights. I would love to do a biopic and a comedy on the lines of ‘No Entry’ again. Also I work with UN Free and Equal campaign for LGBTQIA Rights and it keeps me well connected to my cause,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/blessed-to-live-so-close-to-nature-celina-jaitley/story-LRLHegtxwUtkRu6KPQQS3O.html

The officer added that not only a very small number of migrants are now left to be sent back, but also many of the remaining migrants are now cancelling their return trip after receiving assurance of regular food and work from employers.The police said that most of the stranded migrants who had registered to return home by Shramik special trains from Maharashtra have been dispatched except those from West Bengal since trains to the state were suspended due to the state government’s preoccupancy with the destruction caused by super cyclone Amphan. Police said they, too, would be sent back soon.“Registration of new applicants for Shramik special trains has dropped drastically and hardly any migrants are now registering. We have observed that even those migrants who had registered for Shramik special trains are now backing off and opting to stay back in the city as their employers have assured them regular work and supply of food. As a result of this, many Shramik special trains had to be cancelled. On Thursday 11 trains were supposed to start from Mumbai, but as migrants backed off, only 3 trains operated,” said a senior police officer.Amitabh Gupta, principal secretary (special) and head of the three member committee formed to oversee the stranded migrants issue in Maharashtra confirmed the development, “The Mantralay staff--over 1,400 state government employees-- who were given the task to assist police force in the registration process for the migrants, have been asked to return to their office after May 31 as very few stranded migrants are left in the city.”Lakhs of migrants faced tough times in the state after a nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesAfter the announcement of Shramik Special trains, the procedure for registering migrants by Mumbai Police started on May 2.

The national carrier till Friday has operated 3,840 Shramik Specials trains ferrying 52 lakh passengers to their home states. “Out of 3,840 trains, 71 were diverted to deal with network congestion only between May 20 and May 24, as the railways had to meet the demand of the respective states, nearly 90% of the trains were going to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar,” Yadav said. Among the destination-states for which the trains were diverted were Bihar (51), Uttar Pradesh (16), Jharkhand (2), Assam and Manipur (1 each).Among the originating-states, for which trains were diverted were Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan.He also added that it is not possible for trains to get “lost”. The clarification came amid criticism over delays and diversions of Shramik trains.The railways had come under criticism over the delay and diversion of several Shramik Trains in the last week. A Gorakhpur-bound Shramik Special train from Maharashtra ended up in Rourkela, Odisha adding two days and five states to the original journey, leaving its passengers clueless. With several Shramik Special trains bound for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar being delayed and diverted over the past two days, the ministry of railways on Sunday said the convergence of trains to these destinations have caused congestion in the network adding that the total number of trains to the region has increased. Most of the destinations in UP are around Lucknow-Gorakhpur sector and in Bihar around Patna. Of 565 trains running since yesterday, 266 were going to Bihar and 172 to Uttar Pradesh, the ministry had said. “Only four trains took more than three days to reach the destination states in the north eastern part of the country,” Yadav clarified adding that allegations of trains taking nearly nine days to reach were incorrect. Yadav said there was also uncertainty in demand that led to the congestion. “As per railway capacity, it was not a 24-hour steady flow. The originations of Shramik Special trains took place after completing all the local protocols by the state mostly in post noon 16-24 shift. Thus, this left one third route capacity per day to handle these trains,” he said. “On arrival, all passengers were registered and screened by state governments, which limited the capacity of terminals to handle trains. As against 20 minutes taken in normal trains, it took one to three hours in releasing the train at terminals,” he added. Demand for Shramik Special trains, has lately been diminishing he said. “It appears that demand for these trains is declining from the originating state. 137 trains were flagged yesterday (Thursday) and 172 the day before (Wednesday). Demand for trains has been going down in the last two days,” Yadav said.Nearly 1,524 Shramik Specials operated in the last one week from May 22 till May 28 ferrying over 20 lakh passengers. On May 20, as many as 279 trains operated in a single day. As of last week, originating states had indicated a demand of 923 trains for migrants, which had come down to 450 trains as of Thursday, Yadav said. “Railways have accommodated almost all requests received from the sending states and we are ready to meet all demand of Shramik movements. We will run Shramik Trains for as long as they are needed. Each and every migrant will be transported,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/71-shramik-special-trains-diverted-due-to-congestion-railway-board-chairman/story-tJp3DDqRQ3hCOMVevKuPvM.html

Many in this list were not in the main contact or near the said COVID positive person but still their name has figured in the list, while some, who were in close proximity have been left,” said a BJP leader whose name figures in the list.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesLocal intelligence unit personnel, wishing not to be named, said that about 500 people had attended the ration kit distribution programme and the list of people to be quarantined was compiled on the basis of information gathered. “Based on video footages and photographs of the event and statements of the organisers and receivers, the list was compiled,” the intelligence unit personnel said.Congress Mahanagar president Sanjay Aggarwal alleged the district administration didn’t quarantine local legislator and cabinet minister Madan Kaushik under pressure, while normal citizens and migrants were being forced into quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-patient-jumps-quarantine-to-attend-bjp-event-in-uttarakhand-booked-for-attempt-to-murder/story-8772lluERgmVZ1iKftIK5J.html
29-05-2020||India||Kerala all set for monsoon but something is amiss||Dark clouds have started hovering over the horizon of Kerala, God’s Own Country, a sign of the impending monsoon in the season’s first stopover in the country. The spectre, amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, appears ominous in light of last two monsoons when torrential rains left behind a trail of death and destruction in the coastal state.Pre-monsoon rains have lashed many areas, indicating a downpour over the next couple of days.The south-west monsoon, often called the season of plenty, is likely to keep its annual date with the state on June 1.Initially, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) authorities had said the onset would be delayed by four to five days, but on Thursday it became abundantly clear that the four-month season’s arrival is bang on time. Clouds will start a northward journey after drenching Kerala.Monsoon is a symbol of prosperity, as hope springs eternal for a bumper harvest, much to the delight of farmers, policymakers and economists alike. But this year, Covid-19, touted as a once-in-a-century life-altering event, has been a dampener.To be sure, the ‘monsoon magic’, as the state tourism markets the season, is absent this time due to the viral outbreak. Only jaded police personnel are standing guard on empty beaches and the thriving Ayurveda and wellness centres, which make a killing during this tourist high season, are busy counting their losses. While houseboats in the backwaters have been converted into makeshift Covid-19 quarantine centres.Usually, itinerant travellers and shutterbugs throng the state during monsoon, and some even travel following the northerly-moving clouds. But, the pandemic has kept such seasonal adventures at bay, as travellers are running for cover from the highly-contagious pathogen.Fear is the key this monsoon in Kerala.“I had renovated my Ayurveda resort four months ago at an estimated cost of over Rs one crore. I was eyeing a good footfall of high-end foreign tourists. But this tourist season is over even before it started. The aftershocks will be felt next year as well, as the hospitality sector has been a frontline sector that has been roiled by the pandemic,” said PK Prakash, a resort owner in Vizinjam.State tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran echoed Prakash, as the viral outbreak has crippled the thriving sector. “It’ll take long to recover,” he said.Many schools and other shelters, which usually house flood-affected people during monsoon, are either occupied by migrant workers or Covid-19 patients.Kerala was devastated by floods in 2018 when over 400 people had died and at least 10 lakh were affected. Last year, too, the floods had claimed 110 lives. The ravages of the floods in two consecutive years are still visible in several places in Idukki and Wayanad. Monsoon-related epidemic such as dengue, leptospirosis, chicken guniya and other maladies are an annual feature.“We’ve asked all medical units to report mass cases of pneumonia and other respiratory tract-related ailments as preventive measures to diseases that occur during monsoon every year,” said state health minister KK Shailaja.To make matters worse, the IMD authorities have predicted heavy rains for the third year in a row, which have added to the state government’s woes amid the viral outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-all-set-for-monsoon-but-something-is-amiss/story-7Jjj6gnTB1Du928P7Tl9ON.html

29-05-2020||India||PIL seeks sanitary napkins be declared essential commodity, HC asks Centre to respond||The Bombay high court on Friday directed the Central government to respond by next Friday to a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking an order declaring sanitary napkins an essential commodity and their inclusion in the public distribution system.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice KK Tated took up the PIL jointly filed by law graduate Nikita Gore, who works as a research assistant at the Aurangabad bench of the high court, and law student Vaishnavi Gholave.The petition, filed through advocate Vinod Sangvikar, highlighted the plight of thousands of women and adolescent girls travelling with migrant workers amid the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown.It said measures have been put in place to meet different needs of the travelling migrant workers, but there is complete neglect on the need for sanitary napkins among menstruating women.Highlighting the need for easy access to sanitary napkins, the petition said hygienic menstrual absorbents help adolescent girls and women to manage menstruation effectively, safely, comfortably and fearlessly.The freedom from the fear of leakage or unpleasant odour increases their ability to be at school or the workplace during menstruation, it added.Woman cannot predict when menstruation will start and there should be easy availability and supply of sanitary pads and clothes at the family level and at schools and workplaces, it further said.The petition added that for hygienic and proper menstruation management, a system should be evolved, consisting of easy access to hygienic absorbents and availability of facilities for cleaning and disposal of used absorbents or waste with privacy and dignity.The petitioners said sanitary napkins are an essential requirement for every woman, and women should have the right to get them at cheaper rates, since, on an average, a woman spends about 3,000 days of her life menstruating. Any lack of cleanliness during this period may lead to infections, they argued.The petitioners also sought proper implementation of national guidelines for menstrual hygiene management issued in 2015 by the Union ministry of drinking water and sanitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pil-seeks-sanitary-napkins-be-declared-essential-commodity-hc-asks-centre-to-respond/story-PXfGx2EdtXxyC8v8PXyNxL.html

Condolences to his family. RIP,” said the tweet from PM’s account.Chhattisgarh has declared a three-day mourning to show respect to the departed leader, who remained a force in the state politics till his very last day. He was currently representing Marwahi seat as an MLA of Janta Congress Chhattisgarh, a party he formed in 2016 after quitting the Congress. His son now heads the party.His former party president Rahul Gandhi also tweeted his condolences to Jogi’s family.“I’m sorry to hear about the passing of Shri Ajit Jogi, former Parliamentarian & Chhattisgarh’s first CM. My condolences to his family, friends & followers in this time of grief.

He said that giving more relaxations can lead to an increase in coronavirus cases, news agency PTI reported. “If you ask my personal opinion, strictness will have to be maintained. Giving more relaxations at this stage can lead to increase in cases. Because the stage at which coronavirus is right now, need of the hour is that lockdown should be extended,” he told reporters in Chandigarh. Giving reason for his suggestion about lockdown extension, the minister said that there already exists relaxations in lockdown norms and more relaxations would result in spike in cases. “Already relaxations have been given like opening of ‘bazaar’ (markets), factories… domestic flights have restarted. I am not in favour of more relaxations because cases are going up,” Vij said, adding he would convey his opinion to the chief minister.Haryana on Thursday registered 123 fresh Covid-19 cases, biggest single-day spike, and one death in Gurugram, its worst-affected district. Sixty-eight of the new cases were detected in Gurugram alone. The state’s case count now stands at 1,504, while the death toll is 19.Vij also justified the strictness at Haryana-Delhi border, citing a sharp increase in coronavirus cases during the past week in Haryana districts bordering the national capital. The minister had ordered sealing the Delhi-Gurugram border on Thursday. Anil Vij, who also has the health portfolio, on Thursday wrote a letter to the additional chief secretary, home department stating that sharp increase in the Covid-19 cases in Haryana was happening due to large scale movement of people between Delhi and the state.“Cases are increasing in the districts adjoining Delhi. The main reason for this is movement of people from Delhi into these adjoining districts of Haryana. Barring the categories exempted by the Delhi High Court and those exempted by the Centre under lockdown 4.0, the state borders for others will remain completely sealed,” the order had said.Following the sealing, hundreds of commuters were stuck on the Delhi-Gurugram on Friday morning. Police said all the 11 points that connect Gurugram and Delhi had been sealed and entry would be allowed on the basis of passes issued by the district administration.Restrictions were also put up at Delhi-Faridabad border. Talking to media, Vij said , that if Haryana allowed free movement of people at its borders with Delhi, then its cases would be at par with the national capital. “I regularly monitor things and keep a close watch on the situation. Here we are trying to save each life, if we do not maintain strictness at the borders and allow free movement of people, then I can say undoubtedly, our cases would be at par with Delhi. I have to stop free movement of people,” Vij asserted.However, he added that if the central government will allow free movement of people after lockdown 4.0 ends on May 31, the state will follow the directions. Gurugram district reported 68 positive cases on Thursday — the highest single-day spike so far — taking the number of cases in the district to 405. The district has the highest number of cases in Haryana.  The death toll due to the disease in Delhi stands at 316 as against 19 people in Haryana, according to the Union health ministry data on Friday evening. With, 16,281 active cases, the national capital has over ten-times more cases than Haryana which has 1,504 Covid-19 active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-should-be-extended-beyond-may-31-haryana-minister-anil-vij/story-CynfHwhzQbjAx9tL1Wb1FL.html

The crop-destroying swarms first attacked Rajasthan and have now spread to Punjab, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.“Generally, locusts are found at lower levels and therefore pose a threat to aircraft in the critical landing and takeoff phase of the flight. Almost all air intake ports of the aircraft will be prone to ingestion in large numbers, if the aircraft flies through a swarm (areas like engine inlet, air-conditioning pack inlet etc.),” the regulator said in its circular.Pitot and static sources can also get partially or fully blocked while flying through locust swarms, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said.“Blocked pitot and static sources lead to erroneous instrument indications, especially unreliable air speed and altimeter indications,” it said.A pitot tube in airplanes is used to measure the flow speed of the wind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-says-locust-swarms-pose-threat-to-aircraft-during-landing-and-takeoff-phase-issues-guidelines/story-8JaurJk4FqtJIgQKyyHoDJ.html

29-05-2020||India||Centre likely to retain limited role and allow states have more say after lockdown 4.0||The Centre is likely to retain a limited role and allow states and union territories to take decisions on whether to tighten or give additional relaxations in the nationwide lockdown in their respective jurisdictions from June 1, officials said on Friday. The central government may, however, advise state authorities to continue with strict curbs in Covid-19 containment zones in the worst-affected 30 municipal areas that account for 80 per cent of the positive cases in the country. These 30 municipal areas are from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Odisha. “There is every possibility that the Centre will have very limited role with regards to imposing restrictions or giving relaxations from June 1. The states and UTs will take decisions on such issues depending on the situation locally,” a senior government official told PTI. The central government may continue with the suspension on operation of international flights and political gatherings as well as closure of malls and cinema halls, besides ordering mandatory wearing of face mask by people in public places and maintenance of social distancing norms everywhere. On reopening of schools or restarting metro train services, the states may be allowed to take a call. “From now onwards, lockdown measures will be reviewed every fortnight where states will have major say in every decision related to their respective jurisdictions,” the official said. The states may also be allowed to take a decision on allowing religious places, which have been shut since March 25, when the lockdown had begun. Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa had recently said that he has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him that Karnataka be allowed to reopen temples, mosques, churches and other religious places. The nationwide lockdown was first announced by the Prime Minister on March 24 for 21 days in a bid to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. It was first extended till May 3 and then again till May 17. The lockdown has been further extended till May 31. Hectic parleys are still going on in the central government to assess the impact of the lockdown so far and the role to be played by the centre government and the States and Union Territories after the fourth phase of the curb comes to an end on Sunday. The central government is particularly concerned over the COVID-19 situation in 30 cities, including four metros of Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai, where positive cases are spiralling. On Thursday, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba had a meeting with municipal commissioners and District Magistrates of 13 of these 30 cities and took stock of their work to check the virus. The 13 cities are Chennai, Delhi/New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Thane, Pune, Hyderabad, Kolkata/Howrah, Indore, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur. To take views of the state governments on the future course of action with regards to the lockdown, Union Home Minister Amit Shah has spoken to all Chief Ministers of the country. During his talks with the chief ministers, Shah sought to know the areas of concern of the states and the sectors they want to open up further from June 1, another official said. Interestingly, till now, it was Prime Minister Modi who had interacted with all chief ministers through video conference before extension of each phase of the coronavirus-induced lockdown and sought their views. This was for the first time that the home minister spoke to the chief ministers individually before the end of another phase of the lockdown. Shah was present in all the conferences of chief ministers along with the prime minister. It is understood that majority of the chief ministers wanted the lockdown to continue in some form but also favoured opening up of the economic activities and gradual return of the normal life, the official said. After his talks with Shah, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said he felt the lockdown may be extended for 15 more days. “However, we want some more relaxations like opening of restaurants with social distancing at 50 per cent capacity,” he said. The central government is also taking into account the rapid increase of coronavirus cases in states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam and Karnataka after arrival of migrant workers and other people from big cities or virus-hit regions. “Some states want curb on travel of people from outside. However, such blanket decisions are not acceptable to everyone,” the official said. The Karnataka government on Thursday decided to suspend air travel from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, saying a large number of people arriving from these states have tested positive for COVID-19. While extending the fourth phase of the lockdown from May 18 till May 31, the central government had announced continuation of prohibition on opening of schools, colleges and malls but allowed opening of shops and markets. The government, however, allowed limited operations of train and domestic flights. The Indian Railways is also running special trains since May 1 for transportation of migrant workers from different parts of the country to their native states. The number of COVID-19 cases in India has climbed to 1,65,799 on Friday, making it the world’s ninth worst-hit country by the coronavirus pandemic. The Health Ministry said the death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 4,706 in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-likely-to-retain-limited-role-and-allow-states-have-more-say-after-lockdown-4-0/story-WacO3hhMLOuQTpVVceQ48O.html
29-05-2020||India||FAO may declare locust invasion a ‘plague’ if it takes a turn for the worse by end of 2020||The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) may declare the locust invasion a “plague” if it takes a turn for the worse by end of this year following successful breeding in India, Pakistan, and in west Africa. The locust invasion has been currently categorised as an “upsurge” by FAO.The Union Agriculture Ministry’s Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), headquartered in Jodhpur, has sprayed Malathion 96 and Chlorpyrifos, both organophosphate pesticides, to control the locust invasion across states. Both pesticides are extremely toxic and high exposure may cause nausea, dizziness, and even death in humans. It can also impact soil fertility by altering the ecological balance.“Unfortunately, spraying of chemical insecticides is the only effective method, when desert locusts are in such large numbers. There are biopesticides that are safe ways of controlling them but may not be as effective. FAO doesn’t encourage control of desert locusts by farmers. State or federal teams that are trained in locust invasion management should do it with safety equipment,” said Keith Cressman, senior desert locust forecasting officer at FAO, during a webinar organised by the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on Friday. One of the options with farmers is to dig trenches around their farms to prevent hoppers from entering. Making noise can scatter locusts but they prevent focused control operations by authorities as the insects move in different directions.Cressman said the current severe locust invasion is linked to climate change-induced aberrations in rainfall. “There was good breeding in India last year, the monsoon was protracted, which allowed a further increase in locust populations. The drying vegetation in southwest Pakistan also led to them reaching India a month in advance,” he said. India was alerted by FAO last year about the possibility of waves of invasions and that LWO authorities are in a position to control these waves. “India is well equipped. It has the oldest national locust programme in the world.”The desert locust was expected to remain limited to its desert habitat, but it scattered to Madhya Pradesh (MP), Uttar Pradesh (UP), and Maharashtra because of the strong north-westerly winds following super cyclone Amphan last week.There are two situations India is currently staring at: with the onset of monsoon rains the locusts, which have now scattered to MP, UP, Maharashtra from Rajasthan, will come back to their summer breeding sites in the desert along the India-Pakistan border. “They will be flying back and forth with the winds till monsoon arrives,” he added.The other forecast that FAO has made is that with the southwest monsoon winds desert locusts that bred in the Horn of Africa will travel to Rajasthan across the Indian Ocean in June.Richard Mark Mbaram, a technical adviser to the ministry of agriculture, Nigeria, said, “spraying of insecticides is compounding environmental problems in the Horn of Africa. We do not have the wherewithal to undertake these measures at the scale required, we need aircraft to spray, expertise to spray. Biotechnological interventions should be considered…locust invasions are an existential challenge if they are allowed to exist in the coming years.”“Except for Malathion 96, the rest of the pesticides are highly poisonous. They are red labelled. They are meant for locust control in desert areas, which are largely uninhabited. But the same pesticides are being sprayed on in areas with habitation and with water bodies. These pesticides will drift and residue will remain. They’ll definitely disturb the ecological balance of the area and kill natural enemies — pests, which can counter other crop pests. We can expect an outbreak of other pests,” said GV Ramanjaneyulu, executive director at the Hyderabad-based Centre for Sustainable Agriculture. “Desert locusts don’t multiply in non-desert areas so there is no point in spraying toxic pesticides in such large quantities in other states. They have a short life cycle and will die in due course. The government must consider biocontrol agents,” he added.“We’ve conducted control operations in 47,000 hectares in Rajasthan, Gujarat, and MP by spraying pesticides,” said KL Gurjar, deputy director, LWO. “A locust swarm is scattered near Jhansi in UP. But there is no clear indication that some of them will fly towards Delhi,” Gurjar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fao-may-declare-locust-invasion-a-plague-if-it-takes-a-turn-for-the-worse-by-end-of-2020/story-bBBKZ3i3eS4xVBeDIpyXFM.html
29-05-2020||India||Ajit Jogi, pivot of tribal and dalit politics, dies at 74||Ajit Pramod Jogi, the maverick politician and the first chief minister of Chhattisgarh, who was the pivot of tribal and dalit politics in the state, died this Friday afternoon. He was 74.The former CM, who breathed his last in a Raipur hospital, was reported to be working on his autobiography.Jogi, through dint of hard work, became a formidable political force in the state. He was a voracious reader, brilliant orator, a jan-neta and extremely popular among schedule tribes, schedule castes and Muslims in the plains of Chhattisgarh.He began his journey from the village pathshala and worked his way through numerous achievements and failures alike.Watch | Chhattisgarh’s first CM Ajit Jogi passes away; President, PM Modi pay tribute Awed by the power and charisma of a Parsi IAS officer who visited his village, kid Jogi decided to become a bureaucrat. His Marathi Brahmin teacher guided him in that direction by prodding him to learn English. Brilliant in studies since childhood, Jogi went to study engineering in Bhopal. As was his habit, he topped his engineering class in 1964.Jogi first got selected into the Indian Police Service (IPS) but while training in Mussoorie, he felt that officers from other services were treated condescendingly by the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers. He sat for the exam again and secured a high rank, which then made him eligible to qualify for the IAS.As per his records, he served as collector for 12 years in different districts before resigning in 1986 and joining the Congress. He was sent to the Rajya Sabha twice by the Congress in 1986-92 and 1992-98.It was during his stint as Raipur collector that Jogi got acquainted with Rajiv Gandhi.“Rajiv ji was a pilot and when he used to come to Raipur, I visited him at the airport. He always treated me as a friend. We used to talk for hours on various issues in the VIP lounge of Raipur airport,” Jogi told this reporter during an interview in 2018.Soon after Rajiv Gandhi became the Prime Minister of the country. The Congress needed a tribal face to represent it in the Rajya Sabha and it was Digvijaya Singh who suggested the name of Ajit Jogi.Within a day, the bureaucrat resigned to become a politician. Ajit Jogi climbed the success ladder swiftly, becoming one of the most celebrated spokespersons of the Congress. He shared an anecdote during an interview that Narendra Modi and he used to commute to the News Studios in the same car.Being the destiny’s child, Ajit Jogi left behind many stalwarts to become the first chief minister of Chhattisgarh. The newly carved state with a majority tribal population got its leader.However, his political fortunes declined because of the infighting within the Congress. After the defeat in the 2003 assembly election, Jogi attracted a host of controversies right till his death.In 2003, the BJP released a purported audio tape alleging he tried to break up the party by bribing its MLAs due to which Jogi was suspended.But after a few months, he was again fielded by the Congress against Vidya Charan Shukla, who was contesting on BJP ticket, in 2004 parliamentary election from Mahasamund constituency. Jogi defeated Shukla.It was during this campaign, Jogi met with a road accident near Rajim and was wheelchair bound since then.Controversy around his tribal status remained inconclusive till the end.Jogi parted ways with the Congress in 2016 after he and his son were found allegedly involved in fixing of the Antahgarh by-election in Kanker district. Thereafter, Jogi formed his own party Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) in June 2016.In the 2018 assembly election, Jogi, in coalition with the BSP, managed to get seven seats. In total 90 seats, the Congress won 68 seats while the BJP was reduced to 15. Jogi himself won from his traditional seat Marwahi.An ardent Madhubala fan, Jogi remained a versatile human being till the end.Chhattisgarh has lost its own son of the soil. Surrounded by books till his last breath, his autobiography, if published would be a lesson on politics and life.He was the quintessential Chhattisgarhiya, who lived in a bungalow situated in the heart of city known as ‘Sagaun Bangla’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ajit-jogi-pivot-of-tribal-and-dalit-politics-dies-at-74/story-OOqV2lp96IywrLbWKj2sIJ.html
29-05-2020||India||Modi govt set to reach out to masses with list of accomplishments to mark its anniversary||If the first anniversary of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s first term in the office was marked by global outreach and the promise of becoming one of the world’s fastest-growing economies; the first year of the second term has seen the government tick nearly all of the boxes for key poll promises, some dating back to decades.On Saturday, the NDA government completes a year in office amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The government’s report card has a long list of accomplishments even as it is struggles to revive the economy, save jobs and lives due to the viral outbreak.There was shock and awe when within two months after coming back to power, as the government accomplished what was perceived to be unattainable --- the scrapping of Article 370 from Jammu & Kashmir that stripped the border state of its special status. The BJP-led government had a string of successes within the first six months of its rule such as getting Parliament’s nod for banning triple talaq; allowing citizenship to persecuted minorities from south Asian countries; and receiving a favourable Supreme Court verdict on the Ramjanmabhoomi case, paving the way for the construction of the Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya. However, the achievements were marred by violent clashes that broke out over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the proposed National Register for Citizens (NRC), and the Delhi riots that left at least 53 people dead earlier this year, apart from the economic disruptions.But the government is all set to reach out to the masses with a long list of its accomplishments, where its response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has claimed over 4,000 lives to date, tops the list.The BJP will reach out to the public with letters from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, focusing on the theme of self-reliance or Atama Nirbharta and the party workers will make use of the virtual world to publicise the success story scripted by the government in its first year of rule in the second successive term. “The BJP has kept its promises. Most of the poll promises were fulfilled within six months of assuming office. Even during the pandemic the government has ensured that there is a fair distribution of resources and prevented unrest, which is a huge achievement,” said Bhupinder Yadav, general secretary, BJP.The pandemic has given the government a chance to prove its mettle, Yadav said, despite casting a pall of gloom over the first anniversary celebrations.“PM Modi’s initiatives, whether it was the timing of the lockdown or the Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package, have been appreciated globally. India has played a lead role in galvanising countries to fight the pandemic in a united manner,” Yadav said.While the opposition parties critical of the government’s response to the pandemic cite the hardships faced by the poor and the migrant workers as a major failure and question the timing of anniversary celebrations, Yadav said it is the responsibility of the government to present its report card.Is the government’s response to the economic upheaval a measure of its performance, as the pandemic appeared to have halted the country’s bid to achieve the $5 trillion economy goal by 2024-25?Prof Biswajit Dhar of the Jawaharal Nehru University (JNU) said there is enough room for the government to do more and it is not the time to take credit.“The government has to redouble its efforts. Pre-Covid-19 also the economy was going downhill, as we had registered one of the weakest growth for several quarters for a long time. One thing, which is common between then and now, is that there is a greater role for government involvement and role for fiscal policy to help us weather the storm and we haven’t seen that happen. Even now the government is not willing to use the fiscal space adequately, even the IMF (International Monetary Fund) has spoken about it,” he said.Dhar suggested the government a roadmap, as the markets have collapsed completely. “…You cannot expect the private sector to borrow money or come up with investment; that was not happening even before Covid-19 struck, despite the tax benefits to the corporates. We didn’t see adequate investments coming in because there was a demand deficiency. We expect the government to be more pro-active,” he said.Political analyst Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for Studies of Developing Societies (CSDS) said the government may want to create a buzz around the demand for building of the Ram temple and scrapping of Article 370 being met, but it also has to address the concerns that the lockdown was ill-planned and the migrant workers have been left to fend for themselves. “We have to see how they carry out damage control on that front,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-govt-set-to-reach-out-to-masses-with-list-of-accomplishments-to-mark-its-anniversary/story-dYwcXoYhldtNmqYY7ez9XL.html
29-05-2020||India||‘Railways running Corona Express trains, not Shramik Specials’: CM Mamata||Pinning the blame of rising coronavirus cases in the state on the railways, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee accused the national carrier of running “Corona Express trains” and not the Shramik Specials.“In the name of Shramik Special trains, the railways is running ‘Corona Express’ trains,” Bengal CM was quoted as saying by news agency PTIThe Shramik Specials are being run by the Centre to help migrants reach home. The CM accused the railways of packing in most migrants in one trains instead of running several of them. “The railways is sending thousands of migrant workers in one train, why is it not allowing more trains for migrants,” PTI quoted the CM as saying. Claiming that the state was able to control the spike in the number of cases for the last two months, Banerjee blamed the influx of people as one of the main reasons behind the increase in the number of cases.“We were successful in controlling the spread of Covid-19 in last two months, but now it is increasing as a lot of people are coming from outside. The Railways is sending migrants in jam-packed compartments...The number of COVID-19 cases is increasing because of this. The Railways has some social obligation, they cannot just operate on the basis of profit and loss,” she said.The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered that states can’t say no to receiving migrants and that they must be allowed free travel by trains and buses to their respective states. It also directed the railways to provide them food during the journey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-running-corona-express-trains-not-shramik-specials-cm-mamata/story-Ib6rnVmVjrrxgSVY9EqoaJ.html
29-05-2020||India||India’s farmers told to scare locusts away by beating drums||Farmers are being asked to make as much of a racket as possible, using drums, tin containers, utensils and even hiring mobile disc jockeys, in an attempt to scare away locust swarms that are attacking India.Millions of locusts are invading several Indian states and there are concerns they might reach New Delhi, the capital. Some farmers have been playing loud music through speakers fitted on vehicles in a bid to frighten the insects, said Rahul Srivastava, a superintendent of police in Jhansi district, describing the mobile disc jockey systems normally used at weddings. Citizens have been keeping doors and windows closed to stop locusts entering into their homes.“In the event of a locust attack, farmers are advised to collectively beat loud drums, tin containers, utensils and use loudspeakers to prevent locusts from descending on farms and damaging crops,” Suhas L.Y., district magistrate of Gautam Buddha Nagar district, said on Twitter. The government is planning to spray pesticides during the night when locusts rest on trees, he said.Authorities have cleared locusts from about 50,468 hectares (124,709 acres) in several states, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab and Maharashtra, according to the federal agriculture ministry.A massive locust attack on the country’s farms adds another challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration, which is trying to contain the spread of the coronavirus and limit its impact on the economy. It cannot risk food crops getting destroyed by the insects at a time when millions have been pushed into poverty after losing their livelihoods because of the world’s most stringent stay-at-home rules.Some summer pulses, early-sown cotton, vegetables and fruit plantations run the risk of destruction from the winged invaders. The silver lining is that the harvesting of winter crops is over and sowing for the monsoon season is yet to begin.Drones, ChoppersWhile officials in the affected states are working on measures to control locust swarms, the federal government is arranging drones to sprinkle pesticides on trees and inaccessible places to kill the insects. There are plans to deploy helicopters for aerial spraying, according to India’s farm ministry.As many as 15 sprayers will start arriving from the U.K. in the next 15 days, followed by 45 more in one-and-a-half months, the farm ministry said Thursday, adding that affected states will be given financial aid, if required.Swarms of desert locusts occur irregularly in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, usually when drought is followed by heavy rain. Normally, with the arrival of the monsoon, locust swarms enter the desert areas of India via Pakistan for breeding in June-July, but this year pink adult swarms were reported as early as April 30 in Rajasthan and Punjab.This is in part because of the uncontrolled swarms in Pakistan that breed continuously, the ministry said earlier. Swarms of pink immature adults fly high and travel long distances with strong winds coming from Pakistan. Most of them settle on trees during the night and mostly fly during the day.Further AttacksThe locust movement was helped by strong westerly winds from Cyclone Amphan that hit eastern India last week, according to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. Several successive waves of invasions can be expected until July in Rajasthan. These movements will cease as swarms begin to breed and become less mobile. Swarms are less likely to reach south India, Nepal and Bangladesh, it said on its website.The control work is in full swing in coordination with states and the Border Security Force, the farm ministry said. There was no information regarding the entry of any new locust swarm from India-Pakistan border areas as of Thursday. However, locusts entered from Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan on Wednesday, with control operations going on, it said. There are some active swarms of immature locusts in some parts of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.In January, the biggest locust swarm to hit India’s Gujarat in over a quarter of a century resulted in more than 25,000 hectares of wheat, rapeseed, cumin and potatoes being attacked, with at least a third of the crops damaged in 75% of the affected areas, according to the state’s directorate of agriculture. A massive locust attack in 2019-20 saw about 403,488 hectares treated with pesticides, according to the federal farm ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-farmers-told-to-scare-locusts-away-by-beating-drums/story-d3oZ90MNDoPH4EYCsyRw0H.html
29-05-2020||India||52 lakh passengers, 85 lakh meals: Railway presents enormity of Shramik Specials to answer criticism||The Indian Railways on Friday responded to some of the criticism over the management of Shramik Special service including diversions and the lack of food and water on board with a glimpse of the mammoth exercise and the challenges it had to meet. The Chairman of the Railway board highlighted that only 1.85% of 3,840 Shramik Specials trains operated till May 28 had been diverted due to congestion on route to destinations in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.The explanation by the railways follows several incidents of Shramik special trains-- meant to transport migrant labourers stranded due to the lockdown to their home states-- running late by more than 24 hours and getting diverted through unannounced routes apart from scarcity of food, water and hygiene onboard were reported in the past week.Presenting the Railways defence to criticism on the above issues, the chairman said the national transporter had operated a total of 3,840 Shramik Special trains between May 1 and May 28 to carry close to 52 lakh migrants home and only 71 of those trains were diverted on four days due to congestion on the busiest routes.“During the period of May 20 and May 24, the railways tried to meet every demand for Shramik Specials from the states. On one of these four days, Railways operated 279 Shramik trains and on the other three days, over 250 trains were operated. 90% of these trains were destined for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, resulting in congestion on those routes,” he said.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesRailways data shows that 36.5% of all Shramik trains have ended up in Bihar while 42.2% have terminated in Uttar Pradesh, leading to unequal pressure on these routes.“The congestion was also due to our eagerness to meet all the demand for trains made by the states,” he added.The senior railway official added that apart from these four days, not a single Shramik train was diverted. He added that the Shramik trains were now, on an average, running at faster speeds than super fast trains and reaching their destinations on time. A break up of the diversions on these four days shows that out of a total of 71 trains originating from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Rajasthan, 51 were destined to Bihar, 16 to Uttar Pradesh, two to Jharkhand and one each to Manipur and Assam. 23 trains were diverted via Palwal, four via Rewari, 37 via Jharsuguda and seven via Singrauli.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19On the issue of provision of food and water, the general manager said the railways had provided 85 lakh meals and 1.25 crore bottled water to passengers on Shramik specials so far. Explaining the arrangement, he said the state governments were responsible for providing food and water to migrants at the originating stations while the railways served free packaged meals and bottled water on board during the journey.“Railway divisions mobilized local Halwais, Bakeries at various stations to prepare snacks and food for Shramiks,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/52-lakh-passengers-85-lakh-meals-railway-presents-enormity-of-shramik-specials-to-answer-criticism/story-TT0qT1m516ETOtQzwP86qK.html
29-05-2020||India||With tourism hit by Covid-19, people in Goa return to farming, fishing to shore up incomes||With the Covid-19 pandemic expected to hit Goa’s tourism-dependent economy harder than initially thought, people across the state have begun to fall back on more traditional occupations such as agriculture and fishing in a bid to tide over the fall in their incomes.The State Agriculture Department has reported more than four-fold increase in demand for seeds, mainly for planting vegetables.“Usually we used to sell between 200-250 kilos of seed during this time of the year. But this year we have already sold 800 kilos of seed,” Nevil Alphonso Director of Agriculture said. “This is one of the clearest indicators that people are going back to agriculture in these times,” he added. “The biggest demand has been for vegetable seed which can be grown multiple times. We are also seeing an increase in the demand for paddy but we will have to wait until the end of June to measure the increase in area under paddy cultivation -- Goa’s staple crop-- increases,” he added. Vegetables offer the farmers a better price and, unlike rice, can be sold locally even in small quantities. There is demand mainly for vegetables like gourds, pumpkins and cucumbers which grow well during this season as well as beans and ladyfingers. “At the end of the day, we have to do something to fill our stomachs. Some will go back to fishing, some will go back to farming,” said Damião Telles who used to once run a stall along the Candolim beach serving tourists.Tourism being Goa’s biggest revenue-earner, a lot of people have left their traditional occupations like farming and fishing and joined the tourism industry, becoming taxi operators, small hotel owners, shack owners, watersports operators and guesthouse owners. But with tourism now at a standstill due to coronavirus pandemic, these people are relying on their savings or going back to these traditional occupations to earn a living. “We have been guiding and encouraging people to plant within their own backyards and kitchens or in whatever area they can find and teaching them techniques on what crops can be grown alongside others to help with the soil fixation,” Miguel Braganza a professor of agriculture said. The arrival of the monsoons marks the sowing season in Goa much as in the rest of the country.The Goa government has set up a task force to recommend an economic revival plan for each village that is being anchored by the Goa Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development and the Directorate of Higher Education. In an initial document the committee has suggested all panchayats identify potential activities within the village which can provide livelihood to the people -- agriculture and allied activities, horticulture, poultry, dairy, fishing and reviving micro and small scale industries besides traditional livelihood options like artisans etc and a plan to process and market the products. However, challenges remain. Some have complained about lack of cooperation from local panchayat authorities and support from the government to help cultivate lands some of which have been fallow for a few decades. Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said that he expects the slowdown in tourism to be temporary.“Tourism may have dropped for now, but when tourism starts, Goa Tourism is in a better position to quickly rebound in comparison with the rest of the country and will scale new heights. We will bring in new concepts to promote tourism,” Sawant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-tourism-hit-by-covid-19-people-in-goa-return-to-farming-fishing-to-shore-up-incomes/story-6eTvisGPUrbl2UMG5vtiFP.html

Our rough estimates suggest that around Rs 15 crore of ice cream has been destroyed because of the power cuts in Kolkata,” said the spokesperson of the Indian Ice Cream Manufacturers Association (IICMA).According to estimates provided by the IICMA, there are around 30,000 outlets, including neighbourhood shops, in the city and another 500 distributors. Each outlet on an average keeps a stock of ice cream worth Rs 5000 while the distributors keep a stock of Rs 40,000 – Rs 50,000 on any given day. This apart there are ice cream carts which would also need ice and in turn dependent on power supply. “This entire stock has been lost. Once the ice cream melts it can’t be refrigerated and frozen again. It won’t retain the same texture, taste and look. Customers won’t like it any more. We are left with no option but to dump it,” said Sujit Pal, a local shop keeper near Anandapur in east Kolkata, where there was no power for nearly three days after the cyclone.Almost the entire city had plunged into darkness after Cyclone Amphan hit Kolkata with a speed of 130 km per hour last Wednesday. Thereafter large parts of the city remained without power for at least five days at a stretch triggering protests and road blocks. The state government had blamed the private corporation which supplies power to the entire city.But even as power has returned in Kolkata, several areas in cyclone-hit districts of south Bengal are still without electricity. The manufacturers are still suffering huge losses as there has been no production but money is being drained to maintain the stock.“Our factory is near Dhulagarh in Howrah and there is still no power. We are spending around Rs 70,000 every day in diesel to run the generators just to maintain the stock and keep the machines running. Every day we used to produce around 50,000 litres of ice cream. But for the past seven days there has been no production,” said Gaurav Khemani, managing director of the company that produces Rollick Ice Cream.According to estimates provided by the state government around 1.5 lakh km of electricity lines, including 30,000 km of high tension wire, have been snapped and 4.5 lakh electric poles have been uprooted in south Bengal districts where the cyclone hit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ice-cream-worth-rs-15-crore-lost-due-to-power-cuts-in-cyclone-amphan-hit-kolkata/story-DHI70KP8ERG53vILUgyPYJ.html

A ‘red’ warning is usually issued for a severe heat wave.ALSO READ | Heatwave continues to scorch Delhi for 5th dayMuch of north, northwestern and central India including Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, parts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have also been facing severe heat wave conditions.Isolated light showers on Thursday evening in some parts of Delhi and adjoining areas, however, brought down the temperature by a couple of notches.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) too on Thursday predicted that the Delhi-NCR region is likely to witness very light rain and dust storms on Friday till about 8:30 pm.“Very light rain/thunderstorm/dust storms accompanied with gusty winds is the forecast for Delhi NCR till 8.30 pm,” the IMD had said.“The Southwest Monsoon has further advanced into some parts of Maldives-Comorin area, some more parts of south Bay of Bengal, remaining parts of the Andaman Sea and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Conditions are becoming favourable for further advance of the Southwest Monsoon into some more parts of Maldives-Comorin area during the next 48 hours,” the IMD said in its All India Weather Forecast Bulletin.In addition, the IMD said Tripura and Mizoram are also very likely to witness heavy to very heavy rainfall during the next 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dust-storms-light-showers-and-squalls-at-60-kmph-likely-in-delhi-ncr-today/story-hWy2H6izqk9n9ZzOJYQpkJ.html
29-05-2020||India||Lockdown 5.0: Goa seeks reopening of malls, restaurants||The Goa government has sought the reopening of restaurants, shopping malls, and gymnasiums, as part of the easing of restrictions under lockdown 5.0, which is likely to come into effect from Monday for another 15 days in a bid to contain the spread of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, state chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Friday. Sawant, who spoke to Union Home Minister Amit Shah over the telephone on Thursday, said that the state would await the final instructions from the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) before taking a call on the easing of restrictions in lockdown 5.0.“I spoke to Amit Shahji on Thursday. It appears that the lockdown may continue for 15 more days. We’ve sought relaxation in two or three matters, which includes restaurants be opened with 50% of their capacity while maintaining strict distancing norms. People have also been seeking an exemption to gymnasiums. Let’s wait for the Centre’s guidelines on the basis of which the state will take a call,” Sawant said.The CM said that he was in support of the lockdown being extended by 15 more days because of the growing number of Covid-19 positive cases.“Most economic activities have started in Goa except for the opening of restaurants, hotels, shopping malls, and gymnasiums. We believe that at least restaurants, shopping malls, and gymnasiums can be opened if social distancing norms are adhered to. We’ll inform the MHA authorities after their guidelines are made available to us,” Sawant said. The state government is still claiming that Goa is in the green zone, as the recent spurt in Covid-19 positive cases could be directly attributed to people, who have returned to the state amid the easing of lockdown restrictions and there have been no reports of community transmission. Goa has reported 69 Covid-19 positive cases, including 38 patients who have recovered, to date.While seven Covid-19 positive cases were reported in the first phase of the lockdown between March 25 and April 14, another 62 – most of them asymptomatic --- were recorded after interstate travel restrictions were partially eased.The state authorities are testing all returnees from this week unless they can produce a Covid-19 free certificate issued 48 hours before their entry into Goa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-5-0-goa-seeks-reopening-of-malls-restaurants/story-xQP6CjsB9Vx0099wOEQ7qO.html

International passenger flights continue to remain suspended.A total of 1,65,605 people have travelled through 1,827 domestic flights that have traversed Indian airspace between Monday and Thursday. On Friday, Puri tweeted, “Figures for domestic flights for 28th May 2020 till 2359 hours: Day 4, Departures 494, 38,078 passengers handled, Arrivals 493, 38,389 passengers handled.” A total of 16 asymptomatic passengers on seven different flights, including 13 who travelled by IndiGo, have tested positive for COVID-19 since the resumption of domestic air services. Two of the other three asymptomatic passengers who tested positive for the infection had travelled by Spicejet while one took a flight of Air India subsidiary Alliance Air.On Monday, a total of 428 domestic flights carrying 30,550 passengers operated while on Tuesday, 445 flights ferried 62,641 people.On Wednesday, 460 planes flew 34,336 passengers.In February, when the lockdown was not imposed, around 4.12 lakh passengers travelled daily through domestic flights in India, according to Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) data. During the pre-lockdown period, Indian airports handled around 3,000 daily domestic flights, aviation industry sources said.Airports in West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana and Tamil Nadu have been allowed to handle a restricted number of daily flights as these states do not want a huge influx of flyers amid the rising number of COVID-19 cases.While domestic services resumed in Andhra Pradesh on Tuesday, they restarted in West Bengal on Thursday. Though domestic flight operations across the country began on May 25, they could not be restarted in Kolkata and Bagdogra as the West Bengal machinery was involved in relief and restoration work after cyclone Amphan’s devastation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/494-domestic-flights-ferried-38-078-passengers-in-india-on-thursday-govt/story-pamGs9bsoOFl2dPbKnqk3I.html

In its weather outlook released on Friday afternoon, the IMD further said that conditions are becoming favourable for further advance of the monsoon.A low-pressure area is likely to form in the Aabia Sea on May 31. “The low-pressure area is very likely to concentrate into a depression over the West-Central Arabian Sea during the next 24 hours and likely to intensify further thereafter,” the IMD said in its outlook.“The low-pressure area is likely to move northwestwards across south Oman and east Yemen coasts during next 48 hours and then move west-southwestwards,” it further said.It also predicted scattered rainfall accompanied with lightening and squall in western Himalayan region and adjoining plains for three days under the influence of a western disturbance and an east-west trough.The IMD said that heatwave has abated from most parts of the country, and relief from extreme heat will be there from May 30 to June 2.The weather department had said earlier on Friday that the monsoon is likely to hit Kerala on June 1.Anand Sharma, Deputy Director-General, India Meteorological Department (IMD), said that due to the prevalence of western disturbance over Himalayan region, the North-Western parts of the country would have temperatures less than 40 degrees Celsius in the coming days.“We have said that monsoon will hit Kerala on 1st June, it’s a good sign. First week is going to be good for west coast especially up to Maharashtra,” he said.The advance of the monsoon over Indian mainland is marked by monsoon onset over Kerala and is an important indicator characterising the transition from hot and dry season to a rainy season. As the monsoon progresses northward, relief from scorching summer temperatures is experienced over the areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-tracks-low-pressure-system-in-arabian-sea-and-its-impact-on-monsoon-says-heatwave-is-gone/story-DWE45N4PdST7Bx6wZ99XkN.html

There is weak evidence that children and young people play a lesser role in transmission of Sars-CoV-2 at a population level. Our study provides no information on the infectivity of children,” said the study, which analysed data from 6,327 studies published till May 16 this year.The role of children and young people in spreading the disease depends on several factors, including their susceptibility to infection, severity of symptoms, viral load, social contact patterns and risk behaviour.Clinical series and testing of symptomatic cases alone give biased estimates of susceptibility in children, who often don’t develop symptoms.“The susceptibility of children to Sars-Cov2 is low, according to most of the information. If they are asymptomatic, as most are, transmission risk will be very low,” said K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India.Studies on Covid-19 prevalence in children have produced widely varying results, the University College London analysis noted.Large studies from Iceland, the Netherlands and Spain and Italy showed markedly lower Sars-CoV-2 prevalence among children and young people, but studies from Sweden, the UK and some cantons in Switzerland and Germany found no difference in infection prevalence between adults and children.The Swedish Public Health Agency found 4.7% antibody prevalence in children and teenagers, compared to 6.7% in adults aged 20 to 64, and 2.7% in 65 to 70-year-olds, indicating significant spread in schools.“Long-lasting school closures not only leads to a loss of learning but the isolation also harms their mental health and social development, so we have to consider whether the harm outweighs the infection risk for children, who can spread it to their families, school staff and the community,” said Rajesh Sagar, professor in the department of psychiatry at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Most schools across India have been shut since March 21, the weekend before a national lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24.Unlike Sweden, which kept day care centres and schools through ninth grade open without major adjustments to class size, lunch policies or recess rules, schools in India are unlikely to open before July to lower children’s expose to infection.“Most young children find it difficult to follow social distancing norms and given the large number of students in one classroom, and crowded transport and playgrounds, schools can easily turn into infection clusters if children infect teachers or take the infection to their family and neighbourhood, even if they don’t get severe disease themselves,” said Sagar, who specialises in child mental health.Socially and economically disadvantaged children, who depend on schools for mid-day meals, education, nutrition and health because of socioeconomic disadvantages, are among the worst hit by prolonged school closure.A paper on rethinking the role of schools after Covid-19, published in The Lancet, stated: “School provides a structured setting in which children can learn and develop social competencies, such as self-confidence, friendship, empathy, participation, respect, gratitude, compassion, and responsibility. Social and emotional learning is important for young people to become conscious members of a solidarity-based community.”A hybrid model of education with greater dependence on e-learning is being used in many countries that are reopening schools post lockdown, but it has its challenges. “Since all children do not have access to online learning because of uneven access, teaching using radio and television should be considered as that group cannot be ignored,” Sagar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infection-risk-half-in-kids-but-they-spread-coronavirus-study/story-zZhZESbGVI3ohTSNGYYKSP.html
29-05-2020||India||CBI registers preliminary enquiry to probe finances, international linkages of Tablighi Jamaat||In further trouble for the Tablighi Jamaat, the Central Bureau of Investigation has registered a Preliminary Enquiry (PE) to investigate international linkages as well as foreign funding of the religious organisation, two officials familiar with the development said.The CBI probe will primarily focus on whether Tablighi Jamaat violated any norms of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) while receiving donations from individuals or entities abroad, the officials added.The agency sleuths have already collected relevant probe documents from Delhi Police Crime Branch and analyzing the same. It will also take copies of 47 charge sheets filed by the Crime Branch this week against over 900 foreign members of the Jamaat. The charge sheets filed over three days run into over 40,000 pages. “CBI has registered a PE against organisers of Tablighi Jamaat and others on a complaint alleging that the organisers and trustees of Jamaat were indulging into dubious cash transactions by using illegal/unfair means and also in non-disclosure of the receipts of foreign funds to the authorities,” a CBI spokesperson said on Friday.As per CBI Standard Operating Procedure, a Preliminary Enquiry is the first step to verify any irregularities following which a decision is taken on whether or not to file an FIR. The central agency’s involvement in the case is crucial as it has significant experience in international probes, including finding money trails and international links of individuals.“We will look into financial operations of Tablighi Jamaat and the people behind its funding here in India and abroad; antecedents of people associated with it and its sister organisations,” said one of the officers cited above.The agency is likely to summon office bearers of the religious organisation in Delhi and other cities including its chief Maulana Muhammad Saad after studying all the documents. If required, CBI may even take help of foreign agencies at a later stage through proper channels, said the second officer.Tablighi Jamaat’s lawyer Fuzail Ayyubi didn’t respond to calls till filing of this report.Delhi Police Crime Branch had filed a criminal case against Jamaat chief Saad and six other officials of the organisation in March for defying a series of government directives, which curbed religious and large gatherings to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the national capital. More than 2,300 people, including foreigners, were evacuated from the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in March-end and lodged in quarantine facilities in Delhi by the authorities.The government had claimed that members of the Tablighi Jamaat were responsible for almost 35% Covid-19 cases in the country till April 7. Over 1,800 foreign Tablighi workers were blacklisted by ministry of home affairs for violating visa conditions. The Enforcement Directorate is already probing the organisation and Saad under the money laundering act. The anti-money laundering probe agency is investigating how the money received by Markaz exchanged hands and if hawala networks were used for the same.It has been noticed in the past that several terrorists belonging to Indian Mujahideen and operatives in India inspired by ISIS had attended Tablighi Jamaat events.However, the Tablighi Jamaat has never been named in any terror cases in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-registers-preliminary-enquiry-to-probe-finances-international-linkages-of-tablighi-jamaat/story-muUJ6GvA42l2N7AmlQcGMM.html
29-05-2020||India||Amphan carries hundreds of oceanic birds into mainland Bengal; frigatebirds dying of exhaustion and hunger||Pelagic birds that spend most of their life in oceans and move towards coasts only to breed have been sighted by the hundreds for the first time in the southern districts of West Bengal after cyclone Amphan battered the region on May 20, bird watchers said.Amphan, which hit the Sunderbans coast at a speed of 155-165 kmph, carried the birds deep into the mainland with its sheer force, experts said. The sightings have been recorded by some scientists from the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) and birders in Kolkata, South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly districts.Among the pelagic birds sighted are different types of frigatebirds such as the greater, lesser and Christmas frigatebird, Wilson’s storm petrel, sooty tern, lesser crested tern, great crested tern, brown noddy and short-tailed shearwater.“While terns of some varieties can be spotted in coastal areas where they even feed on freshwater fish, frigatebirds of so many types are never seen in mainland Bengal. Some may not survive the exhaustion and hunger. They cannot find food,” said G Maheswaran, scientist and ornithologist at ZSI. “Some of my colleagues have photographed these frigatebirds,” he added. “Frigatebirds can survive only in oceans where they dive deep to catch fish. The cyclone surely killed and maimed many of these birds. Had the cyclone hit the coast during the movement of migratory birds from central and south Asia, the devastation would have been severe,” Maheswaran added. A couple of the birds sighted last week were seen in the past but only in small numbers. According to a research paper published in Indian Birds, the short-tailed shearwater, for example, was recorded for the first time in India in 2013 at Namkhana in the South 24 Parganas.“While the terns and shearwaters have moved towards the ocean, the frigatebirds are caught in different districts. There are reports of some found by villagers in critical condition. We are preparing reports by crosschecking information with birders in different districts and consulting experts,” said Sujan Chatterjee, secretary of the West Bengal-based Birdwatchers’ Society. “Restriction on movement during lockdown and disruption in telecommunication have made the job difficult,” he added.A data reviewer for e-Bird in West Bengal, birder Sandip Das said, “For the first time, greater frigatebirds have been spotted at New Town in the eastern fringes of Kolkata. I photographed a few near Bally bridge. Some have been spotted in Hooghly district as well.” Bally bridge connects Kolkata to Howrah.Swarup Saha, an ardent birder at Batanagar in South 24 Parganas district, visited the local river jetty with his camera on the morning of May 21. “There were a few hundred terns of different types. I could not believe my eyes. The flocks were moving towards the coastline. I spotted around 30 roseate terns among 300-odd bridled terns,” said Saha.“There have been many cyclones but Amphan was a different experience. Pelagic birds found at Lakshadweep or around the western coast of India have been seen in Bengal for the first time. A fellow birder spotted a Wilson’s storm petrel right here at the Kolkata riverfront. It was beyond imagination,” said Sandeep Biswas, a birder from Dum Dum in the north-eastern fringes of Kolkata.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amphan-carries-hundreds-of-oceanic-birds-into-mainland-bengal-frigatebirds-dying-of-exhaustion-and-hunger/story-l0uVf2JnppZT6NcyA6IO5O.html

On March 25, the government had made an appeal to doctors, including the retired ones, to come forward and join the efforts to fight the pandemic. “38,162 volunteer doctors, including retired government, Armed Forces Medical Services, public sector undertaking or private doctors have signed up with the government to battle COVID-19 pandemic,” the official told PTI. The official further said Niti Aayog has sent a list of names of these doctors to Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). In a statement posted on Niti Aayog’s website on March 25, the government had said those who wish to contribute to this noble mission may register themselves through a link provided on the Aayog’s website. “The Government of India requests for volunteer doctors who are fit and willing to be available for providing their services in the public health facilities and the training hospitals in the near future. “We appeal to such doctors to come forward at this hour of need. You could also be a retired government, Armed Forces Medical Services, public sector undertaking or a private doctor,” the statement had said. It had noted that in case the outbreak leads to a high number of infected individuals, India’s public health facilities will face tremendous load to take care of a large number of patients. Many countries, including the US, Italy, the UK and Vietnam, had also urged retired health workers to come back to work amid the pandemic. The number of COVID-19 cases in India has climbed to 1,65,799, making it the world’s ninth worst-hit country by the coronavirus pandemic. The Health Ministry on Friday said the death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 4,706 in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-than-38-000-doctors-volunteer-to-join-fight-against-covid-19/story-1Au83KsjILKe2013I76odN.html

Karim alias Boro Karim was arrested from Kashimnagar village in Suti area by the anti-terrorist squad of the special task force (STF) of Kolkata Police and Murshidabad Police in a joint operation.A district police officer, who did not want to be identified, said while speaking to HT that Karim was hiding in Karnataka and returned to West Bengal recently along with some migrant workers.Aparajita Rai, the deputy commissioner of police (STF), said Karim was among the top three JMB terrorists wanted in India.“Boro Karim was the main leader of the Dhuliyan module and would actively supply logistics and support and shelter top leaders. His name was mentioned as the main operative by JMB terrorists arrested in Bangladesh,” Rai said from Kolkata.“In 2018, we seized a substantial quantity of explosives and jihadi material from his house during a raid but he escaped,” she added.STF received information that Karim offered shelter to JMB’s top leader Salahuddin Salehin when he visited India.Y Raghuvamshi, the superintendent of police of Jangipur police district, said Karim hails from Chandnidaha village in Shamserganj.“Karim has four children. We were looking for him for a long time. We have come to know that Karim was hiding in Karnataka.

In the same flight, 167 passengers left for Kolkata at 11.15 am,” airport director VK Seth told reporters.Besides sanitisation, a foolproof medical screening apparatus was set up at the airport to check all the incoming passengers as well as those at the departure terminal, he added. The domestic air services in Tripura were meant to start from May 25 but the flights connected to Kolkata were cancelled due to Cyclone Amphan. Before lockdown, total six aircraft were in operation at MBB Airport, the lone airport in Tripura.There are 12 airports in the North-East region. They are in Guwahati, Silchar, Dibrugarh, Jorhat, Tezpur (all Assam), Tezu and Pasighat (Arunachal Pradesh), Agartala (Tripura), Imphal (Manipur), Shillong (Meghalaya), Dimapur (Nagaland) and Lengpui (Mizoram).Domestic passenger flights were restarted on Monday after a gap of two months. Different North-Eastern states on Sunday issued separate Standard Operating Protocols (SOP) for the passengers.In Tripura, with the latest 10 cases of Covid-19, the total tally rose to 242, including 162 Border Security Force (BSF) troopers, officers, and their family members. However, the state’s active cases are 72 and three cases migrated to other states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-first-commercial-flight-arrives-in-tripura-after-two-months/story-HAe9kaGoJQd2k1q7JlfvMK.html

She said there was a high risk of her being infected by the Coronavirus in prison.Her counsel also argued Bhardwaj has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis, which made her particularly susceptible to contracting other respiratory infections.The plea was objected to by special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty on the ground that Bharadwaj was booked under stringent provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), and hence couldn’t be released on interim bail, as mentioned by the high-power committee of the Bombay high court. The prosecution also told the court that prisoners in Byculla Jail have access to all facilities and treatment for any ailments.Bharadwaj, along with several other activists, was arrested under UAPA and provision of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for allegedly having links with Maoist rebels and being involved in the Elgar Parishad gathering on December 31, 2017, which sparked caste-based violence at Koregaon Bhima in Pune the next day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elgar-parishad-case-activist-sudha-bharadwaj-s-plea-for-interim-bail-rejected/story-TTy1dnOf58DbGEwG5Eh6VJ.html
29-05-2020||India||Priest, son found dead in Uttar Pradesh temple, police launch investigation||A priest and his son were found dead in a village in Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal on Friday, the police said.“Prima facie it appears to be a case of suicide. The bodies are being sent for post-mortem. We are investigating the matter and further action will be taken,” said Yamuna Prasad, Superintendent of Police (SP), Samhbal.The incident comes a month after two sadhus were killed inside a temple in Uttar Pradesh’s Bulandshahr.Jagdish or Rangidas, 55, and his 46-year-old disciple Sher Singh were beaten to death in Pagona village. Murari alias Raju was later arrested for the murder who told the police that he had an altercation with the sadhus over stealing their chimta or tong.“The accused claimed during interrogation that it was the will of God meaning there was no personal enmity,” a senior government official said while speaking to reporters.“When asked how did he kill them, he said he ate bhang and then came into the temple and attacked the sadhus with lathis (wooden rods) lying there,” he said.In April, two sadhus or priests and their driver were lynched by a huge mob outside Gadhchinchale village, 110 kilometre from Palghar in Maharashtra. They were attacked on the suspicion of being child-lifters.The incident in Palghar took place on April 16.It later emerged that the sadhus - 70-year-old Swami Kalpvriksha Giri and 35-year-old Sushil Giri - belonged to Varanasi-based Juna Akhara and were on their way to Gujarat to attend the last rite of their guru Mahant Shri Ram Giri.So far, more than 160 accused have been arrested by the state CID which is probing the Palghar lynching case.Last week, the body of a sadhu (seer) was found inside his ashram in Maharashtra’s Nanded. The police said that an investigation was launched.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priest-son-found-dead-in-uttar-pradesh-temple-police-launches-investigation/story-1NNZvDHIwM3qzPKPSg7B2O.html
29-05-2020||India||Andhra Pradesh SEC Ramesh Kumar reinstated by high court||Andhra Pradesh High Court on Friday struck down the ordinance promulgated by the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government last month to remove state election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar by reducing his tenure.A high court bench comprising chief justice JK Maheshwari and senior judge Satyanarayana Murthy also revoked the government orders that followed the ordinance and directed that Ramesh Kumar must be reinstated as the state’s election commissioner with immediate effect.Within an hour of the high court’s judgement, Ramesh Kumar announced he had resumed charge as SEC and that he would discharge his duties fairly and impartially as he had done in the past and as mandated.Kumar said on Friday he would like to resume electoral process to the local bodies at the earliest on the return of normalcy in consultation with the principal stakeholders and all political parties.“Individuals are not permanent. But Constitutional institutions and the values they represent alone are permanent in the end. Those who have taken an oath of office to protect Constitution, have a greater responsibility to continue to protect and safeguard these institutions and their integrity,” he said.The ordinance was promulgated by the government on April 10 making an amendment to AP Panchayat Raj Act reducing the tenure of state election commissioner from five to three years and appointing a high court official of judicial officer rank as SEC in place of bureaucrats.Within a day of the issuance of the ordinance, the government appointed Madras High Court’s retired, justice V Kanagaraj, as the state election commissioner and he took charge immediately. The position of Kanagaraj in the wake of the latest high court judgement is not immediately known.The high court delivered the judgement after prolonged hearing of a batch of petitions, including those of Kumar who challenged his removal and that of Telugu Desam Party leader Varla Ramaiah, BJP leader Kamineni Srinivas and former minister Vadde Sobhanadreeshwar Rao.The high court ruled that the state government had no powers to promulgate the ordinance under Article 213 of the Constitution in the given circumstances.The Jagan government chose to remove Kumar through ordinance route, after the official issued a notification on March 15 for the postponement of local body elections scheduled to be held in the last week of that month citing the coronavirus pandemic as the reason.Jagan fumed at Kumar for taking a unilateral decision to postpone the elections without consulting the state chief secretary or even the health department officials. The chief minister accused Kumar of colluding with the Telugu Desam Party since the official belonged to the same caste as TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu.Later, Kumar wrote to the Union ministry of home affairs seeking additional police protection to him and his family as he was getting threatening calls from the YSRC leaders. His letter also became controversial and CID is probing it.Senior advocate Jandhyala Ravi Shankar, who argued for petitioners, said the high court had felt that the government and the governor were wrong in promulgating the ordinance, which is violative of various articles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-sec-ramesh-kumar-reinstated-by-high-court/story-zbaxc5yy8JSbP4kpWc3P9M.html

The man, who returned from the Middle-East recently, was an acute diabetic and was on ventilator support for the last two days, they added.A man had died in the state capital of Thiruvananthapuram on Thursday. He had come from Rajasthan and had to go to Telangana but arrived in Kerala two days ago after he boarded a wrong train.The number of Covid-19 cases in Kerala has gone up after the return of expatriates and people stranded in other parts of the country. Kerala reported 84 fresh coronavirus cases on Thursday, in the highest spike till now, taking the tally to 1,088. Out of the 1,088 cases, 526 are active.Out of 84 new cases 31 are expatriates, 48 came from other states and five people got the infection from others.Experts have questioned the state’s low testing rate citing statistics. While Kerala has tested only 60,685 samples in four months, its neighbour Karnataka had tested 2,28,914 people till May 27 and Andhra Pradesh 412,714. Both states started reporting Covid-19 cases in the first week of March but in Kerala, the first case was reported in January last. Critics say the state failed to capitalise on its early advantage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-covid-19-death-toll-rises-to-9-after-65-year-old-dies/story-HmbKMmNpSwwbMQBZ5bjSbL.html
29-05-2020||India||Assam opens super-speciality hospital to treat Covid-19 patients||Assam on Friday opened a 236-bed super-speciality hospital in Guwahati and converted it into a facility to treat coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients, as the number of positive cases in the north-east’s most populous state is rising towards 1,000.The state has reported 911 Covid-19 positive cases till Friday noon.The new centrally air-conditioned super-speciality hospital has been built at an estimated cost of Rs 150 crore. It has 186 beds in various wards, and another 50 in intensive care units (ICUs). It is also equipped with 14 ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) units, which have been recently imported from Canada, to improve indoor air quality and bacteria management.“The opening of the hospital is a milestone in the state’s healthcare facility to provide the best possible care to Covid-19 patients. It’s a one-of-a-kind hospital in the entire north-east region,” state health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told media persons on Friday after inaugurating the hospital.“We’ll exclusively use the super-speciality hospital to treat Covid-19 patients till the time the pandemic lasts. We expect the number of symptomatic Covid-19 patients, who need special care, to increase in the coming days. This hospital will cater to those patients,” he added.The state has recorded a spike in Covid-19 positive cases because of the easing of lockdown restrictions from May 4, which led to an influx of thousands of stranded people returning home from various parts of the country, including by air since Monday when domestic flight services resumed after two months.“Some experts have said that the centralised air conditioning system could lead to the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease. In a bid to get around the use of the centralised air conditioning system during this peak summer, we imported UVGI units from Canada, despite the lockdown restrictions. These units will neutralise the virus by emitting the ultra-violet (UV) rays and prevent its spread,” Sarma said.“There’ll be an exponential rise in Covid-19 positive cases if the viral outbreak reaches the third stage or community transmission. This hospital will cater to those patients in the event of a medical emergency such as community transmission,” he added.The super-speciality hospital has facilities to conduct surgeries on Covid-19 patients, who need surgical interventions for their other medical complications.“There is no need to panic, as the state has the capacity to treat 5,000 Covid-19 patients,” he added.As for lockdown 5:0, which is likely to be imposed in the country from Monday, the minister said that Assam would like to persist with the ongoing night curfew and is ready to comply with the central government’s guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-opens-super-speciality-hospital-to-treat-covid-19-patients/story-J8DQItJnwx5ShLCX2TW7NN.html

However, we demand that there should be some relaxations, say, restaurants should be allowed with social distancing at 50 per cent capacity. Many people also want gyms to resume,” Goa CM Pramod Sawant said he made the suggestion to Amit Shah.This was the first time that the home minister was in consultation with the CMs. Earlier, the PM used to chair those meetings. An officer at the Centre said that the PM may not interact with the CMs this time.In this phase of lockdown, the Centre allowed extensive relaxations, leaving it to the states to decide what to open and what not. The Centre also was looking to restart the economy reeling under the effect of lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-amid-shah-in-huddle-over-lockdown-strategy-amid-rising-covid-19-cases/story-XLRl2qTatSnZE8i3ixMcLO.html

29-05-2020||India||‘Duty-bound to tell the truth’: Court orders perjury proceedings against cop||In a rare instance, the Bombay High Court ordered perjury proceedings against a police head constable who, as an eyewitness, failed to identify the men who murdered builder Swapnil Shirke. The 30-year-old was killed inside the premises of the sessions court in Nagpur in June 2002.Deepak Trivedi, who was the lone policeman escorting Shirke to the court and was injured and hospitalised in the attack, had failed to identify the accused before a local court claiming that the trial in the case had started after 10 years.Shirke, who was being produced in the court as an accused in an alleged murder case, was chased in the sessions court premises before being stabbed multiple times by 10 men. A division bench of the Supreme court had dismissed an appeal by the accused and upheld the life sentence awarded to Congress corporator Vijay Krishnarao Mate and six others including Raju Bhadre, Kiran Umrao Kaithe, Dinesh Gaiki, Umesh Dahake, Ritesh Gawande, and Kamlesh Nimbarte in 2017. Four others arrested in the case were acquitted for want of evidence.In 2015, the Bombay high court, while sentencing the accused to life imprisonment, had initiated perjury proceedings against head constable Trivedi for failing to identify the accused in the case and issued showcause notice asking him why he should not be prosecuted.The high court’s notice was taken into consideration by the division bench of Justice NW Sambre and Justice NB Suryawanshi while ordering the prosecution of Trivedi for perjury. “High court cannot be a silent spectator where stinking facts warrants interference in order to serve the interests of justice,” noted the bench and added, “If this court remains oblivious to the patent facts on record, it would tantamount to failure in performing its obligation under the law.”Trivedi in his response to the high court notice had stated that he committed the mistake of not identifying some of accused because a period of 10 years had lapsed when he testified before the trial court. He had sought pardon on the ground that he had put in 22 years unblemished service and had been compulsorily retired.The high court, however, refused to accept the explanation. “We are not convinced that because of lapse of 10 years, some mistake has taken place while identifying some of the accused and that the said mistake was not deliberate or intentional.”The bench said being a responsible policeman on duty and since the deceased was in his custody in the court premises when he was brutally murdered, being the eyewitness, Trivedi was duty-bound to tell the truth before the trial court. “However, he has resorted to falsehood and hence, we are unable to accept the explanation offered by him.”The bench also rejected the arguments advanced on his behalf that the high court had no authority to order prosecution for perjury. “This court not only has the authority to exercise such jurisdiction but also has an obligation to exercise such power in appropriate cases,” said the bench. “Looking to the facts of the present case, in our considered opinion, this is a fit case to exercise such jurisdiction, so as to maintain the majesty of judicial process and the purity of legal system,” noted the bench, while ordering for his prosecution.Shirke, an engineering graduate, wanted to start his own business and had ventured into real estate and with uncle Ranjit had decided to develop 21 acres of land at Sakkardara. He had formed a cooperative society under the name Bhagyashri Cooperative Society in 2001 to develop the land which came as succession from the erstwhile royal family of Raje Raghuji Bhosle.Then sitting Congress corporator Vijay Mate had allegedly encroached upon 7,000 square feet of the land in the property that belonged to Shirke, and when he tried to settle the dispute amicably, Mate asked Shirke to stay away from developing the land which set off an ugly war between them.On July 18, 2001, Mate was allegedly shot at and his confidante Sanjay Gaikwad was killed. Shirke was arrested as the main accused in the case. It was in this case that he was being produced when Mate reportedly engineered an attack on him in broad daylight and killed him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/duty-bound-to-tell-the-truth-court-orders-perjury-proceedings-against-cop/story-NVbhZ4ksNXyAvx9VzaB2XK.html

GOI must come clean and tell India exactly what’s happening,” Gandhi tweeted on Friday. The Government’s silence about the border situation with China is fueling massive speculation and uncertainty at a time of crisis. GOI must come clean and tell India exactly what’s happening. #ChinaIndiaFaceoffThe stand-off started in the Ladakh region after China took an aggressive stand and deployed around 6,000 troops of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Sources in the government say that China wants India to stop the infrastructure projects in the border area.India is building roads and bridges in the Ladakh region which will make it easier for soldiers posted in the area to get supplies and weaponry. A bridge being built near Daulat Beg Oldie, the last border post near the Karakoram Pass, has irked China the most.India too has deployed it soldiers deft in managing things on high altitude, matching China’s numbers and resources. Security experts and government sources say that India should not back down, and keep its soldiers there.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on the evening of May 5. The two sides have since then been engaged in a series of meetings.In its first comments on the ongoing stand-off, the Chinese defence ministry said on Thursday that the situation on the India-China border is “stable and controllable”.“China’s position on the China-India border is clear.

29-05-2020||India||Maharashtra: Lockdown relaxation could be behind rise in Covid-19 tally||Maharashtra has inched closer to the 60,000-mark for Covid-19 cases as 2,598 new infections took the state’s tally to 59,546, with health officials saying the easing of the lockdown played a key role in the increase.State health minister Rajesh Tope said the movement of people from “red zone” areas to other districts led to an increase in Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra. The numbers are expected to surge over the next few days, he said, but expressed confidence in the machinery and measures adopted to keep the spread under control.“It is expected the cases would increase, primarily due to the movement of people. How long can we keep things under lockdown? With people from Mumbai going to other districts, the number of cases has gone up,” Tope said on Thursday.“For instance, Jalna had a handful of cases. Today, it has increased to 110. Therefore, in all districts, the testing of people has gone up. We have already strengthened the health infrastructure and other things in these areas. We will have to increase the containment zones in these districts. We are confident that it will be brought under control.”The Maharashtra government expects the surge in Covid-19 cases to continue for the next 10 to 15 days, in conjunction with the movement of people within the state as well as people coming into the state from other parts of the country. According to an estimation by the state health department, the numbers will peak by mid-June.Mumbai on Thursday reported 1,438 coronavirus cases and 38 deaths. The total cases in the city now stand at 35,485, with 1,135 deaths.Against the backdrop of the increase in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, almost all intensive care unit (ICU) beds available are occupied. As of May 28, of the 645 Covid Care ICU beds, 99% were occupied.About 65% of the 4,292 beds with oxygen support were occupied, while 72% of 373 ventilators were in use, data from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) showed.While it is blaming the easing of the lockdown for the surge in Coronavirus cases, the state government, on the other hand, has started a review and planning for further relaxations on curbs from June 1.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had on Wednesday hinted restrictions will be eased on a “trial” basis.The state government has requested the Centre to start Mumbai suburban train services to ferry staffer of essential services in the civic body. If approved by the Centre, access points of train stations will be manned and only essential services staff will be allowed on local trains that will run in the morning and evening.The Maharashtra government is also contemplating reopening schools in a month. As of now, state officials say they will wait for the Centre’s position on the next phase of relaxations and make a decision accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-lockdown-relaxation-could-be-behind-rise-in-covid-19-tally/story-5OqzDZOfyvwBfjwSsz4kcI.html

29-05-2020||India||Traders are also eligible for credit benefits under Aatmanirbhar package: Goyal||Union Minister for Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal has said that the Rs 3 lakh crore credit guarantee facility extended to the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Initiative), a Rs 20 lakh crore relief package recently announced by the government to ease the economic distress caused by the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, would also include traders.The minister said that a majority of shops – irrespective of supplying essential or non-essential goods -- across the country have been allowed to open amid concerns over hardships faced by retail traders, despite the easing of nationwide lockdown restrictions.“The decision to open the remaining shops in the malls will be taken soon after taking into account the guidelines of the Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare,” an official statement said on Friday, quoting Goyal’s meeting with the representatives of traders’ associations via a video-conference facility the previous evening.Goyal said traders are eligible to access easy loans under the stimulus package. “The changes made in the definition of the MSME sector will also help them,” an official statement said on Friday.HT had reported on Tuesday that export units, trading firms, and hospitality ventures could also tap the Rs 3 lakh crore credit facility offered to MSMEs under the stimulus package even if they are not registered as MSMEs, but meet the eligibility criteria.The minister said that several indicators show that the economic recovery is on the anvil. “The power consumption in May is almost at par with the corresponding period last year,” he said.Exports, which declined by almost 60% in April, have started showing an upward trend, and the preliminary figures indicate that the decline in May would be lesser, he said.The services exports had gone up in April as well. He indicated that more than the fall in merchandise exports, the imports showed a sharper decline in April, lowering the trade deficit.Goyal said during the lockdown period, the nation geared itself to fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and ramped up its capacities. “The domestic manufacturing of the personal protective equipment such as face masks, hand sanitisers, hand gloves got a boost, health infrastructure was scaled up, and awareness was generated among the people,” the statement said quoting the minister.Aarogya Setu application was developed during the period, which acts as a shield, friend and messenger during such a crisis, the minister said.“Timely and correct decisions have been taken by the Prime Minister, and adhered to by the people, have helped the country, as we’re in a better position compared to many other nations of the world, with more resources and lesser population,” he added.Goyal told traders not to feel threatened by the e-commerce juggernaut, as the common person has now realised the importance of neighbourhood kirana stores in this hour of crisis.He said the government is working on a mechanism to facilitate B-2-B (business to business) for retail traders so that they can expand their ambit of operations. He also assured the traders to look into pending issues such as term loans and the matter would be taken up with the finance ministry to find a solution.Goyal called upon the traders to use, promote, and support indigenous goods, which is germane to the government’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/msmes-to-get-rs-3-lakh-crore-credit-guarantee-facility-under-aatmanirbhar-bharat-abhiyan/story-lyTcbrJnBP1xTzAwS6kZWO.html

The vehicle, a white Santro, was fitted with at least 40 kilograms of explosives and was found lying abandoned in a village near Rajpora in Pulwama district, where a similar attack on February 14, 2019, had left 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers dead and brought nuclear-armed India and Pakistan on the brink of war.The car was not registered in the Kashmir valley, but in the Jammu division of the J&K union territory, the police said.Also Watch | Car with 60 kg explosives intercepted in Pulwama, major attack avertedA police officer, privy to the investigations, said that the Hizbul militant, who is active in south Kashmir over the last two years and the owner of the car, is still at large, but efforts are on to nab him.Vijay Kumar, the inspector general of police, (IGP), Kashmir zone, had said on Thursday that security forces received both human and technical intelligence inputs last week that Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), which had claimed responsibility for the 2019 Pulwama attack, and Hizbul Mujahideen were planning a major fidayeen (suicide) attack using a car bomb.“On Wednesday, [Jammu & Kashmir] police, Army and the CRPF established multiple nakas [barricades] after the leads about the attack emerged. In the evening, a naka party directed a car to stop, but it sped away. At another naka, warning shots were fired on the vehicle.

The two countries should keep alert on the US, which exploits every chance to create waves that jeopardize regional peace and order,” the nationalistic tabloid Global Times said in a comment piece.Titled “China, India don’t need US help on their frictions”, it said: “It seems Trump finally knows that China and India, the two largest Asian powers, share borders.

India perhaps has been aware of the US’ bad history of mediation in which the US made troubles rather than solved problems, and which turned bilateral disputes into multilateral ones,” it said.New Delhi has subtly rejected Trump’s offer.“As I’ve told you, we are engaged with the Chinese side to peacefully resolve this issue,” Srivastava said when asked about Trump’s tweet on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/committed-to-peace-says-chinese-defence-ministry-in-1st-remark-on-ladakh-standoff/story-Z7LvY2Ng2XreIAaIyuF13I.html

Maharashtra has witnessed 59,546 Covid-19 cases and 1,982 people have died in the western state so far. In Tamil Nadu, 19,372 people have contracted the disease and 145 people have died, while Delhi reported 16,281 cases and 316 fatalities till date. Also read: Amid Covid-19 lockdown, Assam sends pumpkins via cargo flight to DubaiThe number of deaths in Gujarat, the fourth worst-hit state, was higher than Tamil Nadu and Delhi at 316 but the cases stand at 7,495 so far.There will be a continued focus on 13 cities and five states worst hit by Covid-19 and the situation in seven states, which have seen many of their residents who were working outside come back, will be monitored as India exits the ongoing lockdown.These cities are Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Thane, Pune, Hyderabad, Kolkata/Howrah, Indore, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Changalpattu and Thiruvallur, which constitute about 70% of the positive cases in the country.The Centre has said that the focus will continue on two categories of states—those which have seen a large number of Covid-19 cases in last two and half months and those which are receiving a large number of migrant labourers.While Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi and Tamil Nadu fall in the previous category, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand fall in the second. Madhya Pradesh, whose most important commercial city Indore was an early hotspot of the coronavirus disease is also a borderline candidate to be included in the first category.While the former group of large states have seen a large number of cases, shorter doubling period, and higher confirmation rates in tests, the second category is seeing a late rise due to the movement of migrants.State governments are considering the imposition of restrictions only in the containment zones and allowing a range of activities elsewhere if central guidelines allow. They have also sought to demarcate the zones based on the severity of cases and frame their own rules for activities.They would include opening more markets, enabling more inter-state transport facilities, allowing more commercial activity, and possibly even religious places with social distancing norms, multiple state governments officials have said.They are also planning the eventual opening of schools in a month.The Centre gave authority to the states in the ongoing fourth phase of the lockdown to demarcate zones based on the severity of cases, and within a set of broad guidelines, allowed states to frame their own rules on the extent of activity allowed. Several states allowed the resumption of private transport; limited public transport; shops (except in malls and shopping complexes) and industrial activities. The Centre, in this period, also resumed the operation of domestic flights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-over-7-400-new-covid-19-cases-in-24-hours-india-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-1-65-lakh/story-JKaYYPWZCw31tHvxLu5RxL.html

The last conversation between them was on April 4 on the subject of hydroxychloroquine,” said one of the people cited above.“Yesterday [Thursday], the external affairs ministry had made it clear that we are directly in touch with the Chinese through established mechanisms and diplomatic contacts,” the person added.This is the second time that New Delhi has called out such a claim by Trump regarding mediation between India and another country. In July 2019, India had dismissed Trump’s remarks, at a joint news briefing along with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, that Modi had asked him to help resolve the Kashmir issue.Also read: India China standoff explained- Bridge over troubled watersAt that time to, Trump contended he had spoken directly with Modi about Kashmir. “And he actually said, ‘Would you like to be a mediator, or arbitrator?

29-05-2020||India||High alert from Delhi to Karnataka over probable locust attack||Millions of locusts have affected around 100 districts in five states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra and can reach another 12 in the next few weeks, officials have warned.They said another swarm from Pakistan is expected to enter India around mid-June, which would provide fuel to locust activity in the region.The desert locust is a species of swarming short-horned grasshopper, and are known to devour everything in their path, posing an unprecedented threat to food supply and livelihoods of millions of people. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization’s Desert Locust Information Service bulletin, locusts can fly up to 150 km a day and a one-square-kilometre swarm can eat as much food as 35,000 people in one day.Authorities in Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Telangana and Karnataka sounded alerts on Thursday to the possibility of locusts entering their territories even as the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has warned that the crop-destroying insects could reach Bihar and Odisha in the east in the coming weeks.The Delhi government has issued an advisory to officials across various districts to prepare for a potential locust attack after the Centre issued a warning that there was a high chance of the crop-munching insects moving from parts of Madhya Pradesh towards the capital.The Locust Warning Organisation under the Union agriculture ministry warned that Delhi may be targeted by the swarm which hit Jaipur and Uttar Pradesh on May 25, and parts of Madhya Pradesh last week.“There is a chance that the swarm in Madhya Pradesh’s Chhatarpur and neighbouring Jhansi area may move towards Delhi. They will settle in the evening and control operations will take place tomorrow morning. But it’s good that Delhi government is on alert just in case a small number reach Delhi from Madhya Pradesh,” KL Gurjar, deputy director of the nodal organisation dealing with a possible locust attack, said.Similarly, a high alert has been issued in Kangra, Una, Bilaspur and Solan districts after massive swarms of desert locust destroyed crops in adjoining states and that may spread to Himachal Pradesh.Dr RK Koundal, director of agriculture, said on Thursday that field functionaries have been alerted to keep the continuous and constant vigilance on locust activity and get ready to control any emergency situation, according to an official release.Farmers have been asked to report any activity of locusts to nearby agriculture officers.“Desert locusts usually fly with the wind at a speed of about 16-19 km per hour depending on the wind. When swarm settles down in a particular area it should be quickly treated chemically, mechanically beaten and buried by digging trenches,” Koundal said.“At present, the primary method of controlling desert locust swarms and hopper bands is mainly with organophosphate chemical applied in small concentrated doses (referred to as ultra-low volume (ULV) formulation) by vehicle-mounted and aerial sprayers and to a lesser extent by a knapsack and hand-operated sprayers. Small patches of locust should be immediately sprayed by ULV,” he said.Koundal further said that all the field officers have been directed to create awareness among the farmers regarding the locust attack.“Directions have also been given to check its gregarious and solitary forms immediately by spraying contact insecticides,” he added.Bio-Control Laboratory, Kangra and Mandi have been directed to prepare Metarhizium and Beauveria bio-insecticides at their full capacities.Haryana has also issued a high alert in seven districts after locust swarms attacked crops in neighbouring Rajasthan and a few other states, officials said on Thursday.They added that there was enough insecticide in stock to tackle the pest menace.Tractors mounted with chemical sprayers have also been deployed in Sirsa, Fatehabad, Hisar, Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Mahendragarh and Rewari districts, which are on high alert.Farmers maintained vigil hundreds of kilometres away in Karnataka’s Bidar as locusts were expected from western Maharashtra, where they reached on Tuesday. The Karnataka government claimed on Thursday that the chances of a massive locust swarm reaching the state are remote due to change in the wind direction.“...good thing is that the wind is not blowing towards Karnataka..according to the MET department report wind is expected to be towards a different direction,99.99 per cent it (locust) will not come to Karnataka, so farmers need not worry,” BC Patil, the state’s agriculture minister, said while speaking to reporters. A committee, comprising agriculture and horticulture directors and senior officials has been constituted and the officials have been directed to visit Kalaburagi, Bidar, Koppal and Yadgir districts.An official release mentioning the change in the wind direction said the locusts are about 450km away from Bidar district border, and may not reach Karnataka.Minister Patil stating that according to experts locusts have appeared in large numbers due to good rains last year in Rajasthan and have started moving in an eastward direction now.“They travel along the wind direction and not against it,” he said.The minister also said they have stocked pesticide chlorpyrifos and it can be sprayed in case the locusts come.In Telangana, a five-member committee has been appointed to keep a tab on the movement of the locusts and to monitor measures to prevent the swarms from entering the state. Fire engines, jetting machines and pesticides were being sent to the entry point areas on the state’s borders with Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Reports said officials and police in Bhadradri Kothagudem, Mulugu, Jayashankar Bhoopalpally, Mancherial, Asifabad, Adilabad and Pedapalli districts have been put on alert.The Uttarakhand government has set up district control rooms to coordinate locust control operations. Officials said that drones have also been procured to spray chemicals and fire tenders and trackers with chemicals were on standby for pest control operations.Favourable breeding weather caused by a large number of cyclones in East Africa is being attributed to the surge in locust attacks since last year. India, China and Pakistan face the most risk in Asia, according to the UN. Pakistan has already declared an agricultural emergency.Locust attacks are known to cause a considerable drop in agricultural output. A moderate infestation chomped through winter crops in an estimated 300,000 hectares in Rajasthan and Gujarat in January. The crucial summer-sown season begins next month.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-alert-from-delhi-to-karnataka-over-probable-locust-attack/story-AhZiUhglwRmnjt0iPVLWuL.html

The pilgrimage to the 3,880-metre-high holy cave shrine of Amarnath in south Kashmir Himalayas will now be conducted from the shorter Baltal route only, they added.The decision was taken during a meeting held by Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor GC Murmu on Thursday night. It was attended by chief secretary BVR Subrahmanyam, principal secretary to LG Bipul Pathak and director general of police Dilbagh Singh, according to sources.The deputy commissioner of Ganderbal has been instructed to clear the track from Baltal, they said.The government had decided in February this year to hold a 42-day long annual pilgrimage to the holy cave shrine. The Amarnath Yatra was scheduled to begin from the twin tracks of Pahalgam in Anantnag district and Baltal in Ganderbal district on June 23. The pilgrimage was to end on August 3 on the day of Shravan Purnima (Raksha Bandhan).Last year, the Amarnath Yatra was cut short following intelligence inputs of terror threats ahead of the Centre scrapping Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and in 2018, the pilgrimage was held for 60 days.However, the Amarnath Yatra was shelved in April only to be revived a short while later by the Jammu and Kashmir administration, saying the cancelling order stands withdrawn.After the flip flop on the pilgrimage, Murmu said that appropriate decision on organising Amarnath Yatra and Budda Amarnath Yatra can only be taken after periodic reviews of the situation in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Thousands of pilgrims either trek the traditional and longer 45km-long Pahalgam route or the shorter 14km-long Baltal route to one of the Hinduism’s holiest shrines every year. The pilgrimage usually spans nearly a month and a half and takes place during July and August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarnath-yatra-to-be-held-only-for-15-days-this-year-report/story-dhtxXvFm28okRNSobyzzcI.html

Although ICMR is conducting the study through its regional centres, however here they asked Government Medical College, Srinagar to conduct the study in Pulwama district on its behalf,” said Dr Muhammad Salim Khan, head of community Medicine at GMC Srinagar and nodal person for the survey in Pulwama.Pulwama was chosen as it was a low-risk district depending on the number of cases per million population.So far, Jammu and Kashmir has recorded 2,036 cases with 52 Covid-19 patients in Pulwama. No death has been recorded in the district of the 27 fatalities in the Union territory.A team of faculty, resident doctors and medical interns from the department of community medicine at GMC were deputed to conduct the survey. The survey is done by collecting blood samples of volunteers after acquiring their consent on a form.“We collected 400 samples from 10 clusters in the district,” Dr Khan said.“The samples will determine how much infection is in the community and whether there are antibodies in the blood of the people which will determine the level of infectivity,” he said.Each selected site collects data and blood samples of 400 participants of adult population which cumulates to 24,000 samples, which shall be tested to give the inference of cumulative response to the Sars-Cov-2 infection among the general population in the country, the official said.After the survey is completed on Friday, the blood samples will be sent to the ICMR lab in Tamil Nadu’s Chennai.“The trend of seropositivity will also be looked at to monitor the community-level transmission. Pooled seroprevalence from the group of districts for each of the four strata will be used to estimate the prevalence of Covid-19 infection in the country,” the official quoted the protocols.The baseline survey would determine the sero-prevalence of Sars-Cov-2 infection in the community and in high-burden cities as well, while the subsequent rounds would help to monitor the trends of infection in the community. The findings of the survey will also guide the strategy for making decisions related to lockdown options at the district level, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-s-pulwama-part-of-national-survey-to-ascertain-extent-of-covid-19-community-infection/story-1vG1X5xfDAyDppNKd61d8I.html

29-05-2020||India||How last-minute intel thwarted joint mission by terror outfits||Hizbul Mujahideen’s ambition of carrying out an attack on the lines of the February 2019 suicide car bombing in Pulwama may have been fulfilled on Thursday had security agencies not received last-minute intelligence about the movement of a car packed with a powerful bomb in the area, two counter-terrorism officers said.Troops of Jammu and Kashmir’s Special Operations Group (SOG), Rashtriya Rifles, and the 182nd and 183rd battalions of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) secured all the routes to Pulwama and set up checkpoints on Wednesday night after receiving information that a Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist was driving a white Santro car laden with explosives, the officers said on condition of anonymity.Thy were told that the terrorist may be targeting a convoy of troops or planning to ram the explosive-laden car into a security forces camp. Also Watch | Car with 60 kg explosives intercepted in Pulwama, major attack avertedThe car, fitted with a powerful bomb made of around 40-45 kg of ammonium nitrate and nitroglycerin, was spotted at Ayangund, Rajpora in Pulwama around 2.30 am on Thursday. The terrorist – identified as Adil – managed to flee through the jungles, but security agencies averted a repeat of the February 14, 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing in which 40 CRPF troopers were killed. The attack carried out by the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror group prompted the Indian Air Force to bomb a JeM terror camp in Pakistan’s Balakot and brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war. The two counter-terrorism officials cited above said three camps – two of the CRPF’s 183rd battalion and one of the Rashtriya Rrifles -- were located within 3 km and 5 km of Ayangund where the car was intercepted. The area was evacuated by dawn and the bomb-laden vehicle was allowed to explode by bomb disposal squads because defusing it manually was deemed too risky, one of the officers said.J&K director general of police Dilbagh Singh said the attack was suspected to have been planned by JeM and the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). “This is a Jaish and Lashkar joint operation. But the (terror) factory is located in Pakistan, whether it produces terrorists of Hizbul, Jaish or the TRF (The Resistance Front),” he said.J&K Police Inspector General Vijay Kumar said It was not the first time terror groups in Kashmir had worked together. JeM, LeT and HM have regularly used each other’s resources and network of “overground workers” to carry out attacks on security forces or civilians, he said.At least five Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists disclosed to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), after a failed car bombing on a CRPF convoy in Banihal on March 30, 2019, that the HM leadership aspired to carry out a Pulwama-like attack. The NIA will take over the probe of Thursday’s planned attack as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-last-minute-intel-thwarted-joint-mission-by-terror-outfits/story-gdPeipa8ofHhBuceygA5ON.html
29-05-2020||India||Delhi violence: L-G, govt slugfest over prosecutors||Delhi lieutenant-governor (L-G) Anil Baijal and the elected Delhi government led by Arvind Kejriwal are again locked in confrontation -- this time over the appointment of special public prosecutors (SPPs) to argue cases related to the February communal riots in northeast Delhi.The face-off is so intense that the L-G on Thursday decided to refer the matter to President Ram Nath Kovind, citing persistent “difference of opinion,” officials in the L-G’s office familiar with the subject said.Documents seen by HT suggest the confrontation, brewing since April, is over whose panel of public prosecutors should represent the state in the trials pertaining to the northeast Delhi riots, which claimed 53 lives and left over 400 injured. So far, the police have registered 752 FIRs and arrested 1,300 people in connection with the Hindu-Muslim violence The L-G, in a string of written communication between him and the Kejriwal government, has stated that the panel proposed by the Delhi Police should be notified and allowed to fight the cases because the riots “disturbed public order” in the capital and “effective prosecution” was needed “to restore faith of the general public and in the Delhi government”. HT has reviewed the correspondence. The Kejriwal government wants its own panel of “independent and technically qualified” special public prosecutors to be appointed to represent the state.On Thursday, the Kejriwal government approved a panel of prosecutors in a Cabinet meeting. Hours later, senior officials in L-G office said that Baijal was referring the matter to the President for his intervention.A Delhi government spokesperson said: “Invoking the provision of difference of opinion this time, the L-G has not bothered to make it clear as to how ‘good governance’, a reason cited by him in his previous such orders, is being served by blatantly subverting the process of appointment of public prosecutors. This clearly appears to be a question of Delhi government’s panel versus Delhi police’s panel because the L-G has not pointed out any deficiencies in our panel, nor has given reasons why Delhi Police’s panel should be preferred. Delhi Police being the investigative agency should have no role in deciding the prosecuting lawyers to maintain the independence of investigation and prosecution. ”The tussle began in the first week of April when Delhi police proposed a set of special public prosecutors to argue the riots cases and the L-G endorsed the move. When the file came to the Delhi government for perusal by the home minister Satyendar Jain, he shot down the police’s proposal, formed a fresh panel of lawyers and issued orders on April 16 that they be notified as the special public prosecutors.“The proposal of the Delhi Police suffered from both technical irregularities and {was} malafide. It was malafide because certain names in the panel were found to be directly related to senior police officers...,” read Jain’s noting on the file, seen by HT. Documents showed that the Delhi police subsequently withdrew its panel and submitted a second list of special public prosecutors on April 24. But it was again shot down by the Delhi government with Jain reiterating his order of notifying panel. Jain met the L-G on May 21, but the differences persisted. The L-G wrote to the government on May 23 and later invoked Article 239AA(4) of the Constitution (difference of opinion with the council of ministers) to refer the matter to the President.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-violence-l-g-govt-slugfest-over-prosecutors/story-BRAbPjvxrpIRKW40YCg7rM.html

29-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||How many migrants have moved back home during the lockdown? The Solicitor General of India says 9.1 million across India; Uttar Pradesh says it has seen the return of 1.8 million; and Bihar says 1 million. There are more waiting to return home – jobless, in some cases, after the units where they were working shut down during the lockdown imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease, and homeless, in some others, after being turned out by landlords.There have been sporadic news reports of how the return of migrants has caused a spike in cases in some states. In Bihar for instance, around 1,900 of the roughly 3,010 cases (all case numbers are as of Wednesday night) in the state involve migrant workers who returned to the state since May 1. And in Assam, around 700 of the roughly 800 cases are of migrants who returned to the state since May 4. This was always going to be a problem, but how big a one is it?The correct answer to that would be: currently, not very big.Here’s why: Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are the Big Six of India’s Covid-19 charts. The numbers in some have waxed and then waned (or made to wane). Others continue to see a lot of cases. Between May 1 and May 27, the proportion of cases in all other states (states other than the Big Six) has actually dipped – from 25.2% to 23.4%. It touched a low of 20.7% on May 22 and has since inched up. Its peak during this period was 25.5% on May 3.The trend is similar for deaths.In the same period, the proportion of deaths in states outside the Big Six has changed from 17.3% to 15.7%. It peaked at 17.4% on May 10.Also read: In Lockdown 5.0, states ask for curbs only in containment zonesThe numbers are skewed, of course – by Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi, when it comes to the number of cases, and Maharashtra and Gujarat when it comes to the number of deaths – but current evidence would indicate that the great Indian hinterland is still relatively safe.I say relatively because the number of cases in absolute terms in states that have received migrants has increased. For instance, the number of cases in Bihar rose from 932 on May 13 to 1607 on May 20 to 3036 on May 27. The corresponding numbers for Assam were 80, 186, and 781. And Uttar Pradesh, 3758, 5175, and 6991. But cases in the rest of the country also increased in this period. Thus, the contribution of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, West Bengal, and Assam – all states which send a lot of migrant workers out to other parts of India – to the total number of cases in the country has barely changed between May 1 and May 27. It was 10.5% on May 1, and 10.8% on May 27.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Deaths present a slightly different picture. The contribution of these six states to total deaths rose from 7.4% on May 1 to 9.6% on May 27 (it touched 10% in between). That is still not a significant enough jump, though.It’s possible that a similar analysis done three weeks from now will throw up very different results. Hindustan Times will continue to track these numbers, including details provided by state health departments on the number of returning migrant workers testing positive – all the numbers I have used here are from the database maintained by the HT newsroom’s Covid-19 numbers guy Jamie Mullick – and revisit them in mid-June.For now, the numbers clearly show that the focus of containment and mitigation efforts have to remain the Big Six, and within them, cities and districts that are hot spots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-NrOBlt7SpRxKP2aD423cxM.html
29-05-2020||India||With 31 fresh Covid-19 positive cases, Uttarakhand touches 500-mark||With 31 fresh Covid-19 positive cases reported on Thursday, Uttarakhand reached the 500-mark in coronavirus positive cases. In the past one week, over 350 cases have been reported from the Himalayan state. The bulletin released by the health department on Thursday evening reported seven new cases in addition to 24 cases detected earlier during the day. The health department informed that Covid-19 positive cases were reported from Dehradun (3), Almora (3) and one from Nainital district. Earlier on Thursday, 24 fresh cases were reported by the state health department including cases from districts like Dehradun (6), Haridwar (8) and Tehri (10).Most of these patients had travel history from Maharashtra. Three patients reported from Dehradun district were vendors from Niranjanpur Mandi, one of the biggest vegetable markets in Uttarakhand.The doubling rate stands at 3.99 days in Uttarakhand for the last seven days, while the rate of infection stands at 2.49%.Uttarakhand has so far tested over 25,380 samples, of which over 19,702 have tested negative and results of over 4,000 samples are awaited. Meanwhile, a 32-year-old cancer patient who was under home quarantine in Ramnagar in Nainital district died on Thursday morning, and tested positive for Covid-19 hours after his death.After his death, health officials said that the person died of cancer and not coronavirus. The patient had returned from Delhi on May 20, where he was undergoing treatment for cancer since the past four months at a hospital in the national capital.Dr. Bharti Rana, chief medical officer of Nainital said that the cancer patient had returned from Delhi recently but the health department was not aware of his return.“He was being treated at a private hospital for quite some time, where the doctors had taken his samples and sent them for testing. Meanwhile, the patient was sent home where he died on Thursday. As of now, we will isolate all his family members and take their samples for testing. Personal protection kits have also been given to the family members for protection while completing the rituals,” said Dr. Rana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-31-fresh-covid-19-positive-cases-uttarakhand-touches-500-mark/story-JozdcjZXNojwrx0QwkuKNO.html
29-05-2020||India||Pak condemns Ram Temple construction, gets a stinging comeback from India||India on Thursday responded sharply to the Imran Khan government condemning resumption of construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya earlier this month, describing a one-page statement put out by Pakistan’s foreign office as “absurd”.The external affairs ministry also underscored that the Indian constitution, unlike the one that Islamabad had, guarantees equal rights to all faiths. “Pakistan’s Foreign Office may take time out and read their own constitution to realize the difference,” the external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.Srivastava also took a swipe at the treatment of religious minorities by Pakistan and a decline in their numbers over the years. “Given its record, Pakistan should be embarrassed to even mention minorities. After all, numbers don’t lie even if they do,” he said.The Pakistan foreign office had on Wednesday condemned the start of work on the Ram Mandir, describing it as part of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) efforts to advance a “Hindutva agenda”. It also claimed that the Indian Supreme Court’s ruling last year had “failed to uphold the demands of justice” and its verdict had shredded the “veneer of so-called secularism” in India..The foreign office statement is part of the continuing effort by Prime Minister Imran Khan to build a narrative, specially aimed at Gulf countries, that minorities in India weren’t safe. Over the last few months, Indian security agencies have identified thousands of handles based in Pakistan that had been trying to push this line on social media. One report submitted to the government last month had sent across a list of 7,000 such handles.These handles, like the government in Pakistan and PM Imran Khan, had exaggerated isolated instances of harassment of minorities during the Covid-19 pandemic to launch a shrill campaign that was aimed at influencing India’s relations with the Gulf countries.Islamabad’s condemnation attempt to attack the Supreme Court’s 9 November verdict that led to setting up of the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust, the external affairs spokesperson suggested that Islamabad clearly was not familiar with a credible judiciary.Also Read: After proxy war in Kashmir, Pak launches cyber war against India and PM Modi“As for the judiciary, Pakistan must realize that theirs is thankfully not the norm. There are others elsewhere with credibility and integrity that Pakistan understandably finds difficult to recognise,” Srivastava said.Construction work for the Ram temple began at the Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya from May 11 after the Centre permitted the construction industry to resume work on projects. Since then, engineers have carried out testing of the soil around the sanctum-sanctorum of the Ram Janmabhoomi.On Monday, Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, chairman of the trust set up on the Supreme Court’s orders by the home ministry had visited the Ram Janmabhoomi after around 28 years and paid obeisance to Ram Lalla, the presiding deity of Ram Janmabhoomi. He had visited the place the last time on December 6, 1992.The high-profile visit was interpreted by some people to signify the resumption of the construction work. Das told reporters that the artefacts recovered recently at Ram Janmabhoomi corroborated that Ram temple always existed at the Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya and that it was remodelled into Babri mosque by making some changes in the temple’s structure. A trust official had said a five-foot long rare Shivling besides a large number of statues of god and goddesses had been recovered from the site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-condemns-ram-temple-construction-gets-a-stinging-comeback-from-india/story-LSKrew8GRl48cXYQB9SXyN.html

As per protocol, he was not allowed inside the prison premises and was questioned about his health and other details.“The guard reported that he was healthy, but told us that two people from his building at Lower Parel in Mumbai had reported positive for Covid-19. We then asked him to get himself tested. On May 24, the test results showed that he was positive,” a jail official said.At Arthur Road Prison in Mumbai, 120 inmates of the 158 who had earlier tested positive for Covid-19, tested negative for the virus. Also, all the 26 jail officials, who were earlier infected with coronavirus, have tested negative, Pandey said.“We too are concerned about the health of everyone who is inside the prisons including the inmates and the staff. We have already submitted documents of 1100 inmates to the courts for them to be released on bail,” the IG Prisons said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thane-prison-guard-reports-for-duty-found-covid-19-positive-on-testing/story-HlW9xYbrvD6rGUgmnw3kGM.html
29-05-2020||India||Migrants can’t be made to pay for travel, says Supreme Court||The Supreme Court finally intervened to protect the interests of stranded migrant workers on Thursday, issuing a seven-point interim order that said it was the job of the state to provide them food and transport and that they cannot be charged for their travel, and asking the Union government, represented by solicitor general Tushar Mehta, a volley of questions on the logistics of ferrying workers back home on trains and buses, including the time they have to wait for transport. The court also remarked that no state can refuse to take back migrant workers. The apex court’s intervention came two days after it took suo motu (on its own) cognisance of the travails of migrant workers, around two months after it seemed to buy Mehta’s contention that there wasn’t a single migrant worker on the roads walking back home, and 12 days after it said it couldn’t prevent migrants from taking to the roads to walk back home or monitor their movements. “No fare either by train or by bus shall be charged from any migrant workers. The railway fare shall be shared by the States as per their arrangement as submitted by the learned Solicitor General and in no case any fare should be asked or charged from any migrant workers by the States and the Railways,” the interim order said.A three-judge bench of the court headed by justice Ashok Bhushan heard the case through video conference and also backed a uniform policy in order to do away with any kind of confusion in dealing with the migrant crisis. In a two-and-a-half -hour hearing, it posed a series of questions to Mehta on various aspects. Migrant workers, many left jobless and homeless after their workplaces or work sites shut during the ongoing lockdown imposed on March 25 to fight the spread of the coronavirus disease, have struggled to get home. In the absence of any public transport, many started walking or cycling back home in March. Some were turned away at state borders and housed in migrant worker camps; others managed to slip through borders. It was only in late April that the home ministry came up with a protocol to transport them by buses. Soon after, on May 1, the rail ministry announced Shramik Special trains for them. Since then, and till May 27, Mehta told the court, around 3,700 such trains have run, transporting five million people back home. But many are still awaiting trains. Some do not have the documentation to register for them. There has also been confusion over who pays for the tickets (some migrants HT’s reporters have spoken to have paid out of their pocket). And the Centre and the states have scrapped over the trains. The return migration has been peppered with tragic incidents — migrants have died on road accidents; 16 were run over by a goods train; and according to news reports on Thursday, at least nine people died on Shramik Special trains in the past 48 hours. In the court, Mehta suggested those walking had been misguided into doing so by some people.Interestingly, between the time the Supreme Court said it couldn’t do anything to migrants taking to the roads and its Tuesday decision to take up the matter, several high courts, including the Madras and the Andhra high courts, criticised the way the Centre and the states have handled the crisis. A group of 21 lawyers from Delhi and Mumbai wrote to the Supreme Court on Monday, criticising its approach. “We address this letter because we believe that the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s failure to protect the rights of the hapless millions of migrant workers in March and its failure to scrutinise carefully the executive’s actions, which resulted in them (migrant labourers) being compelled to stay in cramped unhygienic accommodation without employment and wages and often without proper food and with a much higher risk of Covid infection,” the letter said. HT reported details of the letter on May 27. On Thursday, the three-judge bench that also included justices SK Kaul and MR Shah, asked Indian Railways and states where special trains for migrants are originating to provide food and water to the workers, and directed the authorities to take people found walking to shelter homes. The court asked originating states and railways to provide food and water to migrants during train journeys, as is the current practice. The bench also ordered that states should simplify the process of registration of migrant workers.“The State shall try to endeavour that after registration the workers should be asked to board the train or bus at the earliest...,” the order said. The receiving states should provide transport, health screening and other facilities free of cost, the court added.The court said replies by states and the Centre in the case will have to filed within a week. The case will be heard next on June 5. Various private parties have sought intervention in the case, including NGOs and Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala.“We are of the view that in the responses which are to be filed by the Central Government and the State Governments, all necessary details regarding the number of migrant workers, the plan to transport them to their destination, the mechanism of registration and other details should be brought on the record. The learned Solicitor General has also submitted that an estimated time period and the plan for transportation of all stranded workers shall also be intimated in the reply,” the court said.Mehta, asked about who pays for migrants’ journeys back home, said it was either the states receiving them or those sending them. “In some cases, the money is reimbursed by the receiving state,” he said. The bench noted that such a policy creates confusion and underscored the need for a uniform policy. The issue of train tickets has triggered a controversy in the past, with opposition parties accusing the Centre of making migrants pay. The Centre has maintained that the journey is subsidised. Mehta said since May 1, altogether 9.1 million migrant workers have been ferried to their hometowns by trains and buses till Wednesday. The court asked whether the people being transported were asked “to shell out any money at any stage”. The court also said no state should have the right to reject workers coming back. “There is no question...They are all citizens of India,” Mehta replied.Mehta also complained to the court about “prophets of doom” who keep spreading what he called misinformation. “The Centre is doing a lot to prevent Covid-19, but there are prophets of doom in our country who only spread negativity, negativity, negativity,” Mehta said.He objected to the arguments of senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who was representing NGO Delhi Shramik Sangathan. “It’s a humanitarian crisis. Nothing to do with politics. Don’t make it personal,” Sibal said. In his arguments, Sibal said the Centre failed to prescribe the minimum standards for shelter, food, drinking water, medical cover and sanitation under the Disaster Management Act. “There has to be coordination between national, state and district plans,” he said. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Sujrewala, who has filed an application on the issue, said: “A large number of points of departure or arrival do not have relief camps. There are groups of people standing at the bus stations and railway stations. There is no supporting camp. No state or nationwide plan.”Senior advocate Santosh Paul told HT an early judicial intervention could have avoided a tragedy at a large scale. “This judicial intervention is welcome, but it has come after two months of tragic consequences of the lockdown, hunger and inevitable migration,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-migrants-can-t-be-made-to-pay-for-travel/story-MfBORYNv95Jz6RC63ipOyM.html
29-05-2020||India||Copters, new gear to fight locust invasion amid warning in 16 states||Swarms of desert locusts, which according to a UN alert pose a “severe” risk to the country’s agriculture this year, have reached new locations, chomping through vegetation and crops across farmlands in Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, leading the Centre to issue a locust warning to 16 states. Locusts can fly up to 150 km a day and a one-square-kilometre swarm can eat as much food as 35,000 people in a single day, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization’s Desert Locust Information Service bulletin.The government has readied a fleet of air force helicopters for spraying pesticides, set up 11 new monitoring stations, and is importing new equipment to fight the invasion. Also Read: As locusts invade Maharashtra, Centre assures Mumbai not in their pathLocust swarms have damaged orange, mango orchards and paddy fields in Bhandara, Gondia, Nagpur and Amravati districts of Maharashtra’s Vidarbha region. Maharashtra’s joint director (agriculture) Ravi Bhonsale said a team was rushed to Bhandara on Thursday to spray pesticides in the affected areas. “Timely action averted any major loss to crops,” he said.A locust swarm entered Ghorawal in Uttar Pradesh’s Sonbhadra from Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday afternoon and damaged crops across several villages in the district , which borders Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh. “The damage was not much as most of the vegetables and other crops have been harvested,” said district agriculture officer Piyush Rai.Also Read: About 90,000 hectares hit by locust in 20 Rajasthan districtsFarmers in Agra heaved a sigh of relief on Thursday as locusts from Dausa in Rajasthan moved towards Bhangarh in Rajasthan. “Three locust swarms have moved away from Agra and the one nearest moved towards Madhya Pradesh due to the wind flow,” said district plant protection officer Ram Pravesh Verma. He added the threat continued from the locust swarm traced to Dausa, around 140 km away. Verma said on Thursday a swarm was within 30 km of Agra but due to sudden change in wind directionm it got diverted towards Gwalior. “We are keeping a constant watch,” Verma said.Plant protection division joint director Suwa Lal Jat said the locust threat has been controlled in an area spread over 73,000 hectares in Rajasthan. He added 95,000 hectares was earlier affected across 24 districts in the state. “... Barmer, Jodhpur, Ganganagar, Dausa, Bikaner and Hanumangarh are badly affected,” he said. Jat said a swarm was present between Jaipur and Dausa and may either settle in Alwar or Dausa. Alwar is 100 km from Delhi.Officials have increased the vigil to counter a possible locust attack in Punjab, Haryana and Uttarakhand. Punjab is highly vulnerable as swarms of locusts were seen in Rajasthan’s Hanumanagrh district for a third day on Thursday. Punjab agriculture secretary KS Pannu said authorities in Fazilka, Bathinda and Muktsar districts that border Rajasthan have been equipped with ample stock of pesticides to deal with the locust attack.“Farmers are not being able to sow new crops. We have not seen such an invasion before,” said Raminder Uppal, a locust control official in Punjab’s Fazilka.Haryana and Uttarakhand governments have set up district control rooms to coordinate locust control operations. Officials in these states said that drones have also been procured to spray chemicals and fire tenders and trackers with chemicals were on standby for pest control operations.Farmers maintained vigil hundreds of kilometers away in Karnataka’s Bidar as locusts were expected from western Maharashtra, where they reached on Tuesday. State agriculture minister B C Patil said the wind direction suggested the locust swarm was unlikely to reach Karnataka. “There is a 99.99% chance that it [the swarm] will not come to Karnataka. So, farmers need not worry,” he saidIn Delhi, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar reviewed the mitigation measures on Thursday. In a statement, Tomar’s office said the government was taking the invasion “very seriously” as it could afflict damages in the crucial rice-planting Kharif season beginning next month. India is in the process of importing new equipment to deal fight the infestation. Currently, locust control offices have 21 “Micronair” and 26 “Ulvamast” sprayers to kill the pests. They are specialised sprayers that use malathion and other agents to contain the pests. The agriculture minister has approved the import of 60 sprayers from the Micron Group of the UK, which is a manufacturer of specialist spraying equipment. The ministry also floated bids for drones for aerial spraying of insecticides for effective control over tall trees and inaccessible areas. Helicopters are being readied for deployment, an official said. These pests have to be controlled before farmers begin sowing summer-sown, or kharif, crops during the June-to-September monsoon season. The ministry of civil aviation has approved “conditional exemption to government entity” for use of remotely piloted aircraft systems for anti-locust operations. The equipment being imported from the UK will begin arriving in the next 15 days, another official said. “Usually, locust swarms enter the Scheduled Desert Areas of India through Pakistan for summer breeding in the month of June and July with the advent of monsoon. This year, however, the incursions of locust hoppers and pink swarms have been reported much earlier because of the presence of a residual population of locust in Pakistan which they couldn’t control last season,” an agriculture ministry statement said. A surge in locust attacks since last year is being attributed to favourable breeding weather caused by a large number of cyclones in East Africa. India, China and Pakistan face the most risk in Asia, according to the UN. Pakistan has already declared an agricultural emergency.Locust attacks are known to cause a considerable drop in agricultural output. A moderate infestation chomped through winter crops in an estimated 300,000 hectares in Rajasthan and Gujarat in January. The crucial summer-sown season begins next month.

While his cause of death is yet to be ascertained, fear has gripped the village with residents suspecting that he might have died of coronavirus given his travel history to one of the hotspots in the country. The local police said that the postmortem report will help reach a conclusion.Mahanta’s widow Sombari said her husband worked as a cook in Surat and had returned 10 days ago. He spent seven days at a quarantine centre set up at Adarsha Vidyalay in Garudabasa village before being allowed to go home for another round of quarantine. “Villagers had stopped coming to my house over fears that my husband was infected with Covid-19. No one turned up after his death,” said Sombari.On Wednesday, a two-month-old girl was found dead in a quarantine centre of Bargarh district a day after she arrived with her migrant worker parents and other family members from Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh. Meanwhile, the family of a person from Khurda district, who died in a Covid-19 hospital, has accused the administration of intentionally delaying the issuance of his death certificate.The wife of the deceased alleged that the hospital is yet to declare the death of her husband as the authority concerned has not yet issued the death certificate of her husband.The person had returned to Odisha from Surat in an ambulance on May 15. However, he was denied entry to his village, Balugaon, as he was sick. He was then admitted to AIIMS Bhubaneswar and later shifted to SUM Covid hospital on May 16, where he died on May 26. “He was declared Covid-19 positive in AIIMS. We were even not allowed to meet him because of his infection. We are yet to get any documents related to his death,” said a relative of the deceased.Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party lashed out at the Odisha government and warned of massive protests if it does not start swab testing at quarantine centres.State BJP general secretary Prithviraj Harichandan said that the State government is not following the standard operating procedure (SOP) for Covid-19 testing at the quarantine centres.“Though there is a provision to conduct the test of quarantined people within five days but it is not happening in Odisha, Not conducting Covid-19 test of people seems like a conspiracy of the government to spread the virus in the rural areas,” alleged Harichandan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/55-year-old-odia-man-in-home-quarantine-found-head/story-HRoVS0A2GFRwfdAyrjChaP.html

29-05-2020||India||Centre may focus on states with more Covid-19 cases, migrants||Continued focus on 13 cities and five states worst hit by Covid-19, the monitoring of the situation in seven states that are seeing a return of many of their residents who were working outside, and stringent enforcement of containment zones, which could be smaller zones within municipalities and corporations could be the broad approach of India’s next phase of exit from the ongoing lockdown. All three issues were discussed at the meeting between union cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba and the states on Thursday, according to people familiar with the proceedings who asked not to be named. The meeting was attended by the chief secretaries of the states and union territories, and district magistrates and commissioners of the 13 worst-hit cities. Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayInternal discussions between home and health ministries and the Indian Council of Medical Research have started on the contours of the next phase of the exit from the lockdown. At the meeting, the Centre said that the focus remains on two categories of states, the people added: those which have seen large number of Covid cases in last two and half months and those which are receiving large number of migrant labourers. Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakWhile Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi and Tamil Nadu fall in the previous category, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand fall in the second. Madhya Pradesh, whose most important commercial city Indore was an early hotspot of the coronavirus disease is also a borderline candidate to be included in the first category. While the former group of large states have seen large number of cases, shorter doubling period, and higher confirmation rates in tests, the second category is seeing a late rise due to the movement of migrants. The current phase of the lockdown, the fourth, is set to end on May 31. However, since May 3, when the second phase ended, there have been considerable relaxation in restrictions.

29-05-2020||India||In lockdown 5.0, states ask for curbs only in containment zones||With lockdown 4.0 drawing to an end on May 31, state governments are considering, if central guidelines allow, the imposition of restrictions only in the containment zones and allowing a range of activities elsewhere, including opening more markets, enabling more inter-state transport facilities, allowing more commercial activity, and possibly even religious places with social distancing norms, said officials of a range of state governments.They are also planning the eventual opening of schools in a month. In the ongoing phase of the lockdown, the Centre gave authority to the states to demarcate zones based on the severity of cases, and within a set of broad guidelines, allowed states to frame their own rules on the extent of activity allowed. Several states allowed the resumption of private transport; limited public transport; shops (except in malls and shopping complexes) and industrial activities. The Centre, in this period, also resumed the operation of domestic flights. But the focus now shifts to the next phase. Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe Chhattisgarh government has decided that shops will be allowed to open six days a week with physical distancing from Thursday onwards. “Resumption of commercial-economic activities will also help in reviving economy and providing employment in the state. The idea of restarting maximum number of industries in the state was also discussed,” said a senior official of Chhattisgarh government. In Jammu and Kashmir, a government official said that except shopping malls, multiplexes, restaurants, schools, colleges and gymnasiums, everything else will be allowed. “Quarantine rules by and large shall also remain the same, that is, 100 percent testing of returnees followed by 14 day administrative quarantine or paid quarantine. Following test reports, people are being dealt accordingly. Positive cases are being hospitalized and negative cases are being sent to home quarantine for 14 days,” he said.Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said he got representations from many religious leaders to open shrines, churches and mosques but they will have to wait for some more time. Similarly, television and film production units have also sought the government’s permission to resume, saying the two-month-long lockdown has virtually crippled the industry. Also read| Pandemic poses serious threat to global financial system: FSDCUnlike the past, when Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao was the first to announce extension of the lockdown, on Wednesday, Rao announced that he will wait for Centre’s regulation on the next phase of relaxations. Officials said all shops except those in malls and around the clock movement plying of the state run buses and taxis will, in all likelihood, be allowed. Shooting of films and television products will be allowed from June 1, said minister for cinematography T Srinivasa Yadav. No permission would be given for cinema theatres, function halls, places of worship and other areas of public gathering.In Rajasthan, the lockdown will be reduced to only two categories “curfew and non-curfew zone”. “In non-curfew zone, almost all activities will be allowed,” an official familiar with the decision, but who was not willing to be named, said. Also, the hours for public movement would be increased by two hours — 6am to 8 pm, which currently is 7am to 7pm. This, however, Gujarat government will continue with lockdown 4.0 restrictions in containment areas. In Odisha, which has seen a spurt in Covid cases in the past fortnight with the return of migrant workers, lockdown 4.0 norms are likely to continue. “For us, the scope for allowing any new activities is limited as we want to see and stabilise the situation for at least a fortnight more,” said a state government official, who was not willing to be named. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Officials in some states such as Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Gujarat said they are yet to decide on lockdown 5.0. Punjab’s additional chief secretary, home, Satish Chandra said nothing can be said at this moment as there is some time left. “The state has already allowed all activities except those prohibited by the Union home ministry throughout the country. Let’s see which of these activities are allowed by the centre after May 31,” Chandra said.To be sure, all these measures are contingent on central guidelines. One other area of attention among state governments is schools to ensure that the academic calendar is not disrupted and students can get back. To be sure, the summer break is on in many parts of the country and there is a window of a month, but states believe it is important to plan the opening up.

For context on the relative size of this number, only the eight worst-hit states in the country have reported more cases. On May 16, this number was only 230 and nearly 2,000 cases have been added to this category in just the last four days.Also read: Centre may focus on states with more Covid-19 cases, migrantsSenior government officials said that this category had to be created as several cases cannot be assigned to states immediately as they need additional verification and reconciliation. With increasing interstate movement in the past few days, this number has started rapidly increasing.Officials at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Union ministry of health and family welfare and integrated disease surveillance programme network compile case numbers after collectively confirming a case or a death due to Covid-19. The cases are classified to states or UTs after looking at the person’s the address in their government-issued identification documents such as voter ID cards, driving licenses and Aadhaar cards.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“It is an exhaustive process that requires 100% confirmation of the identity of the person by looking at government documents and other relevant details primarily to avoid duplication and any errors. Sometimes if a person, belonging to for example Delhi, develops symptoms in say Bhopal and gets tested there, then in spite of being a resident of Delhi the case will be counted of Madhya Pradesh because that’s where the test happened. So it has to be clearly documented that it’s a Delhi resident but an MP case. These things take time because several cases fall under this category,” said a government official, requesting anonymity.“We suspect that among the reasons could be that travel is being gradually opened up and people are able to move from one state to another for work or other reasons. These things do play a role,” added the official.Delays can also happen due to verification needed after samples are sent to laboratories, officials said. This happens when markings on the vial don’t have the necessary information printed to establish the identity or case history of a person.“Sometimes the surname is not mentioned on the chit or the spellings are wrong ; then local district surveillance officers are contacted to verify the identity of the person and furnish extra details that are required. Sometimes there is also confusion regarding whether the sample that has come is for diagnostic purposes or of a follow up case. Before final documentation is done all this information has to be clear, so it may take longer than usual with the number of cases going up. That’s what reconciliation and verification means,” said Dr Lokesh Sharma, ICMR official.Unlike all states and union territories that issue number of deaths and recoveries, this heading in the health ministry website does not contain additional details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unassigned-cases-increase-as-interstate-migration-picks-up/story-thzCTEA7Ub39VE8pmRyrFO.html
29-05-2020||India||Wearing masks at home can limit spread: Study||Wearing face masks at home before symptoms develop helps prevent the spread of Covid-19 among people living in the same house, irrespective of the family’s size or crowding, according to a new study that suggests masks be worn all the time in areas with high community transmission.A face mask worn before symptoms started was 79% effective at stopping the virus from infecting others, but masks offered no protection if used after symptoms had appeared, according to a peer-reviewed observational study of Chinese families in Beijing, accepted for publication in BMJ Global Health, an online journal. Disinfection was 77% effective in preventing transmission, the study found.Close daily contact, such as eating meals at a table or watching TV together raised chances of others getting infected 18-fold while diarrhoea as a symptom in patient zero quadrupled infection risk, showed the review of behavioural and hygiene factors in the home environment.“Airborne infection is the main source of infection, the best way to stop the spread of infection is for the sick person to wear a mask. But with around 80% people being asymptomatic or having mild disease, wearing a mask in areas where Covid-19 prevalence is high can help prevent transmission of infection,” said Dr GC Khilnani, chairman of PSRI Institute of Pulmonary and Critical Care and a member of the Delhi chief minister’s advisory committee on Covid-19 preparedness.According to the US Centers of Disease Control’s latest update, Covid-19 primarily spreads between people in close contact through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks are inhaled. “Infection can also spread if an infected person contaminates a surface or object, which is then touched by others who then touch their own mouth, nose, or eyes, but this is not the main source of infection,” said Dr Khilnani.Studies from China show that most of the person-to-person transmission of Sars-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, happens within families. To understand how effective face masks are in preventing infection, the researchers questioned 460 people from 124 families with at least one Covid-19 patient in Beijing about their household hygiene and behaviour during the pandemic. The average family size was four, but ranged from two to nine, and comprised three generations in most homes.The study tracked infections from the incubation period of 14 days from the start of patient zero’s symptoms and found secondary infections in 41 families, where 77 adults and children were infected. Infection occurred in 36% (13 out of 36) children, compared to 69.5% (64 out of 92) adults. Twelve children had mild symptoms, one had none. Most (83%) adults had mild symptoms, with symptoms being severe in around one in 10 people. One adult became critically ill.Daily use of disinfectants, opening widows for ventilation and keeping at least one metre apart were associated with a lower risk of spreading infection even in crowded homes, while daily contact raised risk, the study found.The findings back universal face mask use, not just in public spaces, but also at home, especially for families living with someone in quarantine, and for the families of health workers who have high risk of infection. “Masks also serve the purpose of reminding others to continue practicing physical distancing,” said Dr Khilnani.“Household transmission is a major driver of epidemic growth...This study confirms the highest risk of household transmission being prior to symptom onset, but that precautionary [non-pharmaceutical interventions], such as mask use, disinfection and social distancing in households can prevent COVID-19 transmission during the pandemic, independent of household size or crowding,” concluded the study.How coronavirus spreadsSars-CoV2 spreads very easily and sustainably between people. Spreads more efficiently than influenza but not as efficiently as measles.It spreads between people in close contact (within 2 metres).People get infected by inhaling respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.People without symptoms also infect others.Covid-19 can also spread by people touching a surface or object contaminated with the virus and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.

29-05-2020||India||Local instigation led to exodus of labourers, SG tells top court||Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said on Thursday migrant labourers are taking to the roads on foot because of anxiety due to “local level instigation” and stressed that “stray incidents” should not impact the hearing in the case in the Supreme Court.“They are told ‘walk now, trains won’t run. Lockdown extended’,” Mehta said.He also maintained that some “high courts are running parallel governments”, in an apparent reference to courts in Gujarat, Chennai, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh that passed directions to states and the Centre on the issue.Mehta also said a section of people active on social media, who are writing article and giving interviews, have failed to acknowledge the government’s efforts. “All these armchair intellectuals and so-called public-spirited people have done nothing to contribute,”he said.He went on to draw a comparison between such people and South African photojournalist Kevin Carter, who was awarded the Pulitzer for capturing the photo of a vulture standing behind a starving child in famine-struck south Sudan in 1993. The child, it was reported, was attempting to reach a United Nations feeding centre. Carter left the place after driving away the vulture, but did not help the child reach the feeding centre.“All these people wanting to intervene need to apply the vulture and child story. What have they contributed?” Mehta said.The apex court passed a seven-point order to mitigate the plight of migrants. It also sought detailed reports from the central and state governments.The top court’s first opportunity to intervene in the matter came two months ago when a public interest litigation, Alakh Alok Srivastava v. Union of India, came up before it. The Centre told the court on March 31 that all workers walking on the roads had been taken to shelters and were being provided food. The court expressed satisfaction at the steps taken by the government.“Courts are many times taking statements made by government at face value without really cross-checking...,” advocate Rebecca John told HT.Srivastava filed a fresh plea in May seeking directions for free transport to take migrants home. But the top court once again declined to interfere and left it to the states to deal with the problem, maintaining that it cannot pass orders based on media reports.Another plea for payment of minimum wages to migrant workers during the lockdown was also disposed of by the apex court on April 21 without any concrete directions being passed.Lawyers and former judges criticised the court for its stance. Twenty-one senior counsels wrote to the Chief Justice on May 25, urging the court to intervene. The court eventually took up the matter suo motu (on its own) on May 26.“It really did not require a petition...this kind of prodding. The Supreme Court could have taken suo motu notice much before this,” John said.Senior counsel Sanjay Hegde said: “Hindsight can be 20:20 vision. Intervention may be delayed but is welcome.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/local-instigation-led-to-exodus-of-labourers-sg-tells-top-court/story-J7vrmOZZD6eQ2HxulZ3hMI.html
29-05-2020||India||Coders flag host of issues, offer tips to improve Aarogya Setu||In less than 48 hours since the Android code of the Aarogya Setu mobile application was thrown open for review, at least 165 issues of various levels of severity was flagged by the software developer community to help the government identify and plug holes -- from the way it uses Bluetooth for contact tracing to typos in the text.The number and nature of suggestions that poured in could make Aarogya Setu, now being used by over 100 million Indians, one of the first big government projects to be improved through public inputs, experts said. Also read: Protection or threat? Experts say Aarogya Setu poses national security risk“People have flagged raised a lot of issues and while among these, many may be minor, what it really shows is participatory governance in the making,” said Srinivas Kodali, an independent researcher working on technology, data and governance. “But it needs to be extended to other governance applications and IT systems – it cannot be one-off,” he added.The code of Aarogya Setu for Android phones was shared at 12am on Wednesday on code-sharing website GitHub. A review of issues posted by people varied from concerns over the way the app deployed Bluetooth, typos in the text displayed by the application and suggestions for improvements. “All suggestions are under review by the technical team,” said Abhishek Singh, CEO of MyGov. An IT ministry official, who asked not to be named, added that the technical team has been instructed to notify MyGov in case of a serious issue . Other issues, as mentioned in the timeline by the government, will be reviewed in three days by the team.So far, no “significant” development has been flagged, added the official. However, some posts said that the version available for users to download through the Google Play store is not the version for which the code was made public.One of the more serious concerns, flagged by Sydney-based developer Jim Mussared, concerned the way contact-tracing applications use Bluetooth to determine whether people have been in close contact with another person. The vulnerability, which has at least been identified in Australia’s COVIDSafe application, allows for long-term tracking of users and possibly enables other Bluetooth-based attack vectors, the global vulnerability listing of the problem showed.“We have not confirmed that the issue exists in the Aarogya Setu app, we just wanted to reach out to the team so they could clarify for sure. Given that it affects other apps it seemed important to check with them, but we haven’t been able to get a reply by email yet,” said Mussared in an email to HT. The researcher added that there have been several issues in contact-tracing apps from multiple countries, and that many of these are due to using Bluetooth in this manner. The details of this particular vulnerability will be made public on June 19 at the end of a 45-day embargo that is meant to give developers time to address it.Bluetooth is short-distance radio technology. Its short range is one of the reasons why contact-tracing tools have preferred to use it to determine close contacts, but the technology itself has been vulnerable to hacking. Several of the other posts on the Aarogya Setu GitHub page also suggested how the Bluetooth deployment could be made safer. The government has announced a bug bounty, offering ₹1-3 lakh for researchers who expose serious vulnerabilities. More suggestions are likely to pour in as comprehensive code reviews can take several days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coders-flag-host-of-issues-offer-tips-to-improve-aarogya-setu/story-P1WeZXnmzdeOrvPIllbrqM.html
29-05-2020||India||India working on 30 vaccine candidates for Covid: Govt||Industry, academia and start-ups in India are working on at least 30 vaccines, principal scientific advisor K VijayRaghavan said on Thursday, adding that 20 of them are progressing at a good pace.The focus is on four kinds of vaccine platforms, he said. First is an mRNA vaccine that uses a component of the genetic material of the virus and translates it into a viral protein within an individual’s body to produce an immune response. Second, a weakened form of the virus is injected into a patient that does not cause the disease but produces immune response. Third, the genetic material of the virus is encoded in another viral backbone and injected to produce an immune response. And fourth uses a viral protein developed in the laboratory along with a stimulant called an adjuvant to boost the immune response.India is yet to get collaborators for the phase I and II human clinical trials. Vaccines are usually tested by groups, not just the developer, but hospitals, research institutes and companies also come together to test the safety and efficacy of the vaccines.“The first step in the vaccine manufacturing is to have laboratories that can work with the viral material and we have these. Then, there is a need for partnerships with companies to use the vaccines in animal trials and this is also happening for some. The third stage is the most difficult where we have to do the phase I and phase II trials, and we still do not have collaborators for this, but it will happen,” VijayRaghavan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s top scientific adviser, said at a media briefing.“Usually, a vaccine takes 10 to 50 years and about 200 to 300 million (dollars) to develop; we are trying to achieve the same in one year. So the world is supporting hundreds of vaccine candidates and the cost is likely to go up to two to three billion dollars.”Without naming any company, he said the preclinical studies of a vaccine using the flu as backbone is likely to conclude by October. Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech is working on the vaccine in collaboration with flu vaccine FluGen founders and the University of Wisonsin-Madison. By February 2021, another protein-based vaccine should also be ready, he said.But even after a vaccine is developed, the logistics of making the vaccine available to all will be a challenge, he said. International collaborations help in providing equity of access and risk mitigation for the manufacturers.At the same event, NITI Aayog member VK Paul said India will continue to give anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine to healthcare workers as a prophylaxis. “There are many other ongoing studies apart from the WHO (World Health Organization)’s Solidarity Trial and we are also working on it. If you look at the experience of the medicine, it has been used for malaria and long-term use has also been seen in rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders; the drug is manufactured in the country and is readily available. The drug is known to increase the pH levels and prevent the entry of virus in cells and plausibility is high. The benefits outweigh the risk. So far, we think it is appropriate to use it,” said Dr Paul.The WHO-led international partnership looking for possible treatments for Covid-19 stopped assigning patients to the HCQ arm of the trial pending the review of safety and efficacy data. “Drug discovery for a particular disease is a difficult and a time-consuming process, and many candidates eventually do not work. So, if you buy enough lottery tickets some are bound to work,” said VijayRaghavan.India is looking at several re-purposed drugs such as favipiravir, umifenovir and another drug used to treat psoriatic arthritis. The government is also trying to hold a hackathon, in which students aware of computational drug discovery will work with best computational tools to work on possible molecules to treat Covid-19.Apart from vaccines and drug development, the third focus area is developing faster and better diagnostics. VijayRaghavan said various science institutes are working on molecular diagnostic tests, apart from the well-established Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, that can detect the viral particles. Paul said 20 Indian companies will reach a capacity of producing 500,000 testing kits a day by July. “Science will help us win the battle against Covid-19,” Paul said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-working-on-30-vaccine-candidates-for-covid-govt/story-bCe5rNdfMc1QOYj8jDRQIJ.html
29-05-2020||India||Public transit use likely to fall sharply after lockdown: Study||Fewer residents of the National Capital Region will use public transport over the next six months for fear of contracting Covid-19, and many will use personal vehicles according to a study by research and advocacy organisation Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).The ongoing study shows that before the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25 to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease , as much as 37% of Delhi’s commuters used the Metro, 28%, personal vehicles and 7%, public buses. CSE researchers say these choices are likely to shift after the lockdown comes to a close and public transport services resume completely.In the next six months, the proportion of commuters using the metro is expected to fall to 16%, and buses, just 1%. The dependence on private vehicles, on the other hand, will increase significantly, from 28% to as much as 38%. Delhi government data shows that the Capital has a little over 11 million registered vehicles, of which 3.3 million are cars.The study is based only on the commuting patterns and preferences of middle and upper middle-class commuters. Researchers said that over 400 residents from Delhi-NCR have already been surveyed and more will be surveyed in the coming days to assess commuting patterns after the lockdown ends. CSE officials said upper middle-class and middle-class households are being targeted in the current because people from this strata have the option to switch from public transport to private vehicles and may have the disposable income to afford a second vehicle. The CSE is also conducting another study with a focus on commuters from lower income groups in the city.The findings also show that low contact modes of travel, such as walking and cycling are likely to emerge as preferred modes among residents to cover shorter distances. Before the lockdown 4% commuters walked or cycled , a figure which is expected to grow to 12% in the coming months, the CSE report said.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), CSE, said this shift in commuting preferences can be attributed to peoples’ health concerns. She said that with the present state of the public transport system in the national capital, people are not confident that social distancing can be maintained while travelling on buses or the Metro. “The future and the ‘new normal’ that we will be faced with post-lockdown will demand steps to rebuild confidence in mass transit systems while also improving them. Apart from this, steps will also be taken by the governments to improve infrastructure for contact-free modes such as walking and cycling, and come up with measures to cut unnecessary travel to reduce pressure on already-stressed transport systems,” Roychowdhury said.As Delhi government relaxed movement restrictions in the fourth phase of the lockdown starting May 18, nearly 2,000 DTC and cluster buses were allowed to operate in the city to ferry commuters with an occupancy limit of 20 passengers in each bus. However, despite the government allowing private companies to resume work with complete staff strength, several establishments are still encouraging employees to work from home, which has hit bus ridership. Data compiled by the transport department shows that since operations resumed, the daily ridership in buses has remained nearly 100,000 passengers a day, as against the daily ridership of four million before the lockdown. The Delhi Metro is yet to begin operations.  “If looked at from the service capacity perspective, to regain the original service capacity level pre-lockdown, the city needs an additional fleet of 13,243 buses,” CSE said. Or their efficiency needs to be increased. “Only if protected bus lanes are introduced immediately, the same fleet can provide more kilometres of service and reduce the additional requirement,” CSE’s report added.Delhi currently has 6,847 buses.Experts said that a similar shift towards private vehicles is also being witnessed in cities across the world. Sewa Ram, professor at School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), said that it has been observed that in cities that have opened up after lockdowns and movement restrictions, the preferred mode of transportation has been private vehicles. But he cautioned that the switch to private vehicles would not only increase traffic but also contribute to increased pollution levels.“Public transportation is likely to be used only by those who cannot afford personal vehicles. The policy work that was being done to control the use of private vehicles for all these years will surely be impacted. The fear around this disease is likely to change commuter preferences. Governments will have to bounce back from its impact,” Ram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/public-transit-use-likely-to-fall-sharply-after-lockdown-study/story-GED7MKVY5pBM63VmBMH2dM.html
29-05-2020||India||Pulwama-style attack averted in J&K: Police||A car carrying around 45 kg concealed explosives was seized from Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district, the Union Territory police said on Thursday and added the recovery prevented an attack similar to the one that left 40 paramilitary troopers dead in February 2019 and brought India and Pakistan on the brink of war.Vijay Kumar, the inspector general of police (Kashmir), said they had human and technical intelligence inputs over the last week, indicating that Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), which claimed responsibility for the 2019 attack, and Hizbul Mujahideen were planning a big suicide attack using a car bomb. “On Wednesday, [Jammu & Kashmir] police, Army and the CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force] established multiple nakas [barricades] after the leads about the attack. In the evening, a naka party directed a car to stop, but it sped away. At another naka, warning shots were fired on the vehicle. The car’s driver left the vehicle behind and fled towards a forest under the darkness of the night,’’ Kumar said. He added the entire area was cordoned off after security forces noticed suspicious objects in the car from a distance. “The car was searched and a large quantity of explosives was found concealed in the car.”Kumar said the modus operandi used was the same as in the 2019 car bomb attack in Pulwama, which prompted an airstrike on a terror training camp in Pakistan. Pakistan retaliated a day later on February 27, 2019, and triggered a dogfight between Indian and Pakistani aircraft. It was the first such clash since the 1971 war and an Indian pilot was captured and later released after his plane was downed.Kumar said they suspect Adil of Hizbul Mujahideen, who also works with JeM, and Fauji bhai, a Pakistani JeM commander in Pulwama, were involved in the planning of the failed attack.“The improvised explosive device was diffused in a technical way... The Pulwama police, with the help of security forces, have averted a major tragedy and I congratulate all of the forces.”Investigators said the car carrying the explosives had a fake number plate, which is a strong indication that the militants were planning to carry out a car bomb attack. The car was intercepted at Aynegund in Rajpora area of Pulwama. The Jammu & Kashmir had strengthened security along the Srinagar-Jammu national highway and other sensitive spots earlier this month amid multiple inputs about a possible car bomb attack. Pulwama is located along the highway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pulwama-style-attack-averted-in-j-k-police/story-jKGqiNpIJWAHJoY5LZoiKL.html
29-05-2020||India||‘I blame Congress, MVA for playing politics’: Fadnavis||Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has denied accusations that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wants to topple Maharashtra’s Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. In a telephone interview with Smriti Kak Ramachandran, Fadnavis spoke about the issue. Edited excerpts:How would you react to a perception that the BJP is indulging in politics in the middle of a pandemic?The BJP is not playing politics. [Congress leader] Rahul Gandhi gives statements everyday blaming the Centre government to hide the failures of his own government [in Maharashtra]... this is called politics. We are trying to help the government. The central government is also trying to help. It has given them Rs 28,000 crore... I blame the Congress and MVA government for playing politics because they have no control over the spread of the coronavirus and therefore, they want to set different narratives.They do not want the focus on coronavirus because 37% of the positive cases are from Maharashtra and 41% of the deaths occurred here... There are no beds in hospitals, no ambulances, people are dying on the roads. Does the BJP want the President’s rule?...we have not demanded the President’s rule. The BJP does not want to form the government; this is not the right time. It is more important to fight the pandemic. We want to focus on helping the poor, farmers and use all our energy to help people. I do not think this is the time when we should think of changing the government...Could you elaborate on your statement that the government will fall because of its internal contradictions?...three parties coming together is in itself a contradiction. The ideological view of the Shiva Sena has been diametrically opposite to that of Congress and the NCP [Nationalist Congress Party]. Sharad Pawar [NCP chief] had many times manufactured factions in the Sena. Just for the sake of forming a government, they have come together. But the ideological and cultural differences will not allow them to cope with each other. Has the BJP, with 105 MLAs in the assembly reached out to the state government to offer any suggestions? Or is there a complete breakdown in talks?We have been insisting that the chief minister should call an all party meeting. Even the Prime Minister has held two so far. For two months there was no meeting. Finally,one meeting, where the CM joined through video conferencing was called and we gave constructive suggestions on how to plan the exit strategy from the lockdown, on how to revive the economy, and how to create more health infrastructure. We also talked about the plight of the farmers during the lockdown and how their Kharif crop should be procured. The CM had assured us, but did nothing. I spoke to him on the phone and regularly write letters, but I don’t see any response. However, I will keep on writing and giving suggestions. It is the duty of the ruling party to take everyone along, but in Maharashtra they are not able to even taken along their partners much less the opposition.You said the MVA government is not decisive and is scared of taking decisions. Is this a comment against the CM or the entire MVA?During such times you require a very assertive political leadership that needs to lead from the front. You have to take bold decisions, there will be times when your decisions will be criticised, but if you feel those are in the interest of the state then you should not be afraid of taking bold decisions. In Maharashtra you can see that entire state is run by bureaucracy. Everybody is acting on their own. In such a situation, it is only the political leadership that can bring cohesiveness in the government so that it can function in the right way. Ultimately it is the entire government, but the primary responsibility is of the chief minister. Last week you said the Maharashtra government does not even have a plan for reviving economic activity. What are the other areas where you think the government has failed?A I had suggested to the CM that if we want to restart the economy-- and it is the right time to do so-- we form a team of stakeholders in every sector and also include people from the health sector to form protocols to restart businesses and industry. Let them come to a conclusion on how much can be restarted. Although lockdown is necessary, it cannot be a permanent policy of the government; it is a measure to control the pandemic, the policy of the government should be an exit policy. Wherever possible we have to save and create jobs because it will have a bigger toll on our economy and Maharashtra being an economically progressive state, will be more affected.Looking back do think the power sharing negotiations with the Sena could have been handled better?That is now in the past. There is no value of ifs and buts in politics. We have to now face the reality that we are the opposition and we want to play the role of a constructive opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-blame-cong-mva-for-playing-politics-fadnavis/story-hx8XsNBzcGecZyZpAZQULM.html

The family was first put in a quarantine centre and their samples were taken for Covid-19 test. Suresh Kumawat, the baby’s father tested positive on May 23 and was admitted to MG Hospital in Bhilwara. The others were later sent to home quarantine after a brief institutional quarantine.“The girl had diarrhoea but the family did not inform the officer in charge of home quarantine. On Wednesday, when her condition deteriorated, our team took her to hospital where she was declared dead on arrival,” said Singh.He said because the family returned from Mumbai, a Covid-19 hotspot, and one member had tested positive, villagers suspected the baby also had the infection.“Till Thursday afternoon, the body lay in the house and no one was willing to touch it for fear of getting infected,” the SDO said.He said he went to the deceased girl’s house and tried to convince the family that she was negative. But the family and villagers weren’t convinced. Then the officer lifted the body himself and brought it out.“When people saw me lifting the body, some others came forward. We took the body to a cremation ground where we buried it,” Singh said.Apart from the SDO, police and administration officials were present during the funeral. Two members of the family and some villagers also joined in, said the SDO.Neha Kumawat, a neighbour of the family and who was part of the 12-member group that returned from Mumbai on May 13, said the villagers did not help when the baby was ill and were not convinced that she was not infected.“The family showed them the test reports but they thought the girl had Covid-19,” said the 20-year-old who also tested positive along with the girl’s father and is in a Bhilwara hospital.She said three families started from Mumbai in a hired vehicle early May 13 morning and reached Kareda at night. “We were initially quarantined in a house in the village. Samples of one person from each of three families were taken for testing. We were then shifted to an institutional quarantine. Our samples were taken again and three of us tested positive on May 24,” she said.The other nine among the dozen people were later sent to home quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-officer-performs-infant-s-last-rites-as-villagers-shy-away-over-covid-19/story-d0iIs2bEZJGy9M7JGXpJPJ.html

According to a senior official of the state health department, the majority of these cases are from rural areas in different districts where migrant workers recently returned from other states.“More than 250 of these 344 new cases are migrant workers who recently returned from the states of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Punjab, Gujarat, Delhi and Tamil Nadu,” said a health department official. “Over the past one week, the number of migrant workers testing positive for Covid-19 has crossed 600.”The districts of Malda, Murshidabad, Birbhum, Hooghly, Howrah and Uttar Dinajpur have been the worst affected as most of the state’s migrant workers hail from these districts. Out of Bengal’s 23 districts, only two in north Bengal presently remain unaffected by Covid-19.Malda, Uttar Dinajpur, Birbhum and Bankura had been among the districts unaffected by Covid-19 till two weeks ago. However, over the past one week, Malda has recorded 79 new cases, Uttar Dinajpur 77 new cases and Murshidabad 60 new cases, while Hooghly and Howrah have recorded 87 and 153 cases, respectively, from the rural areas of these districts.While Bankura has recorded 19 cases, and Nadia 34 cases, East Burdwan has recorded 37 new cases.“Most of those who tested positive for Covid-19 in the past week, except for those in Kolkata, were migrant workers. We anticipate the numbers to go up as more results are awaited,” said a senior state government official who did not want to be identified.On Wednesday, chief minister Mamata Banerjee blamed the Centre for forcing the state to accept more migrant workers than its intake capacity, given the precautions needed to be maintained.“Centre’s unplanned transport of migrant workers is turning rural Bengal red. It will also turn rural India red,” Banerjee said.The state government has decided to requisition more schools to turn them into institutional quarantine centres for returning migrant workers. Those returning from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Delhi will be sent to institutional quarantine centres, the administration has decided.Banerjee’s statement, however, has created a political controversy. Congress’ Lok Sabha leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said, “It is utterly insensitive for the chief minister to blame migrant workers for the spread of Covid-19. Migrant workers have been one of the biggest victims of this lockdown. We should sympathize with them and create proper infrastructure and management,” Chowdhury said.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state unit president Dilip Ghosh also attacked Banerjee. “The CM is treating the migrant workers unfairly. It is because of the state’s inability to create jobs that they went to other states in search of jobs. It’s the state’s responsibility to look after their wellbeing,” said Ghosh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highest-single-day-spike-of-344-cases-takes-bengal-covid-19-tally-to-4-536/story-d2BD0B0BglNdJtOIsGWYVP.html
29-05-2020||India||Hydroxychroloquine should be used as per guidelines, its benefits outweighs risks: Niti Aayog member||As per the current available data, benefits of anti-malarial drug Hydroxychroloquine (HCQ) “outweighs” the risks, if any, Niti Aayog member V K Paul said on Thursday, asserting it should be used as per guidelines and recommendations made by the scientific community. The drug has been recommended by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) as prophylaxis for COVID-19 among healthcare and frontline workers, and also for clinical management of patients, he said.Responding to a question over the government’s stand on the use of HCQ in COVID-19 cases after the WHO temporarily suspended its use in the clinical trials citing safety concerns, Paul said it can be used as per the guidelines issued by the ICMR, taking all precautions as mentioned by the apex health research body.“According to current available data and knowledge, the benefits of Hydroxychroloquine outweighs risks if any. We want it to be used as per guidelines and recommendations made by the scientific community,” Paul, who is also the chairman of Empowered Group-1, said.He said that the World Health Organisation (WHO) was not the only platform where the drug was being tried. The medicine was being tried and looked at in several other countries as a potential treatment for COVID-19, Paul said. He said Hydroxychloroquine is a familiar drug and is widely used for malaria and in other auto-immune disease like rheumatoid arthritis. It is produced in large quantities in the country, is inexpensive and has strong plausibility, he said, adding that research will reveal new things.“And, we will get to know more about its effectiveness against the coronavirus as it a new virus. At this stage, whatever guidelines have been provided by the scientific community, we consider it appropriate and it should be used by healthcare workers and frontline workers as a preventive medication against the coronavirus infection as per the prescribed guidelines,” Paul said.“The drug is also being used in clinical management of COVID-19 as per clinical protocol. As per the emerging relevant data we will keep advising further accordingly. Have faith, we are using it responsibly based on current available knowledge,” he said. Paul said several other drugs favipiravir, itolizumab, phytopharmaceutical (a plant-based drug), convalescent plasma, remdesivir and the BCG vaccine are being looked at and are in advance stages of trials.“Eight vaccine candidates in the world, of which four are in relatively advanced stages,” he said In response to a question on whether the novel coronavirus has mutated over the last few months, Principal Scientific Adviser K Vijay Raghavan said, “We have not seen any change in the fundamental properties of the virus till now.” Highlighting the importance of the RT-PCR test in detection of COVID-19, Raghavan said it tests for the presence of the virus’ genetic material. “It is agnostic to whether you have symptoms or not. Even you are asymptomatic, if the virus is there in the body, the RT-PCR will pick it up with great likelihood,” he said. On Tuesday, DG ICMR Dr Balram Bhargava had said that no major side-effects of the anti-malarial drug Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been found in studies in India and its use can be continued as prophylaxis for COVID-19 under strict medical supervision.He said it has been “clearly advised that HCQ should be taken with food, not on empty stomach”.“We also emphasized that one ECG should be done during the treatment. We expanded use of HCQ from healthcare workers to front-line workers also, considering the potential benefits,” he added. The ICMR in its revised advisory on May 22 recommended use of the drug as a preventive medication for COVID-19 for asymptomatic healthcare workers working in non-COVID hospitals and frontline staff on surveillance duty in containment zones and paramilitary/police personnel involved in coronavirus infection related activities.The drug is also recommended for all asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in containment and treatment of COVID-19 and household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases.The Union health ministry on March 31 in its ‘‘Clinical Management of COVID - 19’ had also recommended use of the drug Hydroxychloroquine in combination with Azithromycin on COVID-19 affected patients suffering with severe disease and requiring ICU management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hydroxychroloquine-should-be-used-as-per-guidelines-its-benefits-outweighs-risks-niti-aayog-member/story-ts2SSGpgTny8Ag3OljD8sL.html

Booth facilities can also be developed for this and cooperation of private hospitals should be sought for this,” said Negi.He asked officials to hire outsourced personnel to increase manpower in the health department and ensure that all possible facilities are provided to those being quarantined.At a meeting to review the Covid-19 situation in the state, the health secretary said that there is no shortage of funds in the state and all necessary facilities and arrangements should be ensured in the quarantine facilities.According to the health department’s bulletin, there are 19,939 people in quarantine centres in the state.“The people at the quarantine facilities should be made to feel comfortable. Cleanliness should also be taken care of. Covid-19 Care Centers are very important and officials should try to have more space available there,” Negi said.The health department reported 24 cases on Thursday. Six of the cases were from Dehradun, eight from Haridwar and 10 from Tehri. The new cases have taken Uttarakhand’s tally to 493.Most of these patients had a travel history from Maharashtra. Three of those reported from Dehradun district were vendors from Niranjanpur Mandi, one of the biggest vegetable markets in Uttarakhand.The rate of doubling stands at 3.99 days in Uttarakhand for the last seven days, while the rate of infection stands at 2.49%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-to-boost-testing-in-hilly-areas-as-covid-19-cases-soar/story-r7W8Dd9q3DhbViLtmetfeJ.html
29-05-2020||India||Offices needn’t be shut after a few cases: Govt||The Union health ministry on Monday issued guidelines on preventive measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) at workplace, recommending distancing norms and rules on reporting of infections and sanitisation among other things.The government said the entire office building need not be closed if one or two cases of Covid-19 are reported and work can resume after it is disinfected as per protocol. However, if there is a larger outbreak, the entire building will have to be closed for 48 hours. All staff will work from home till the building is adequately disinfected and is declared fit for re-occupation, the guidelines said.“Offices and other workplaces are relatively close setting, with shared spaces like (corridors, elevators, stairs, parking places, cafeteria, meeting rooms and conference halls etc.) and thus Covid-19 infection can spread relatively fast among officials, staffs and visitors. There is a need to prevent importation of infection in workplace settings and to respond in a timely and effective manner in case suspect case of COVID-19 is detected in these settings, so as to limit the spread of infection,” the government said.The guidelines focus on some key aspects: basic preventive measures to be followed at all times; office-specific measures; measures to be taken on occurrence of a case; and disinfection of the office premises. Here are details from the guideline:Basic preventionThe measures that are to be followed at all times include maintaining a physical distance of at least one metre between colleagues; use of face covers or masks; frequent hand-washing; following respiratory etiquette such as covering mouth and nose while coughing, sneezing with a tissue, handkerchief, flexed elbow, and disposing of used tissues properly. It is important to self-monitor one’s health, and reporting any illness at the earliest.Office-specific measuresThere should be thermal scanners installed at the entry of the office building, along with mandatory placing of hand sanitisers. As far as possible, the entry of visitors in the office complex should be discouraged. Meetings, as far as feasible, should be done through video-conferencing, and exchange of files and other documents should only be done on mail. Gyms, recreation centres or creches located within the building should be closed. The office should be cleaned and frequently sanitised, particularly frequently touched surfaces.“Any staff reportedly suffering from flu-like illness should not attend office and seek medical advice from local health authorities, … if diagnosed… should immediately inform the office authorities,” the guidelines said.On reporting of a positive caseThe guidelines said the people who are ill should be placed in a room or an area where they are isolated from others at the workplace. They should be provided a mask or a face cover till they are examined by a doctor. They should then by reported to local health authorities, or on a phone call to helpline 1075. “A risk assessment will be undertaken by the designated public health authority and accordingly further advice shall be made regarding management of case, their contacts and need for disinfection.”Management of contactsThe high-risk exposure contacts will have to be quarantined for 14 days, and low-risk exposure contacts can continue to work and should closely monitor their health over the next two weeks.Closure of workplaceIf there are one or two cases reported, the disinfection procedure will be limited to places or areas visited by the patient in past 48 hours. “There is no need to close the entire office building or halt work in other areas of the office and work can be resumed after disinfection as per laid down protocol.”If there is a larger outbreak, however, the entire building will have to be closed for 48 hours after disinfection. “All the staff will work from home, till the building is adequately disinfected and is declared fit for re-occupation.”Experts said there was no need to seal entire buildings in the case of low numbers of infections. “If the structure is where there are multiple flats or different floors, then there is no need to seal the entire building as per the infection control guidelines. However, all the flats or floor have to remain under observation, and people should watch out for symptoms,” said Dr T Jacob John, senior virologist, former head of department, Christian Medical College, Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/offices-needn-t-be-shut-after-a-few-cases-govt/story-tWt2yUpF1gIlwdAyzqGKpN.html
29-05-2020||India||Does coronavirus affect children differently?||Clinicians are investigating the possible link of a potentially-lethal inflammatory syndrome characterised by high fever and swollen blood vessels and guts in young children that appears to be linked with coronavirus disease (Covid-19).So far, Covid-19 was believed to have largely spared young children, with most hospitalisations and deaths being reported in older adults and those with chronic conditions. But over the few weeks, around 100 cases of young children being admitted to intensive care units with toxic shock and symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease in the US, UK, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland, which has led the World Health Organisation (WHO) to begin investigating the possibility of its link with coronavirus disease.Kawasaki syndrome is an illness of unknown cause that affects the blood vessel, heart and other organs. The symptoms include high fever, low blood pressure, rash and difficulty breathing and it usually affects children under five years, though a third of the cases in India are in older children. After rheumatic fever, it is the most common cause for acquired heart disease in children.“We are aware of this newly described syndrome from a number of countries in Europe and potentially a small number of cases in North America,” Dr Adam Finn, chair of the WHO’s European Technical Advisory Group, said at a news briefing. “We are urgently conducting a surveillance study in the United Kingdom to establish what is going on,” he added.The incidence rate of Kawasaki syndrome is 150 per 100,000 children below 5 years, but it remains largely undiagnosed in India, according to a study published in Global Cardiology Science and Practice. Boys are at a slightly higher risk, with the male to female ratio being around 1.5:1 in India.Many of the children being treated for the new syndrome in Europe and the US have tested positive for coronavirus, but some have not. That could mean that the syndrome is not related to coronavirus, that the children had cleared the virus before they were tested, or that the test missed the infection. There have been no coronavirus-linked Kawasaki syndrome cases reported from India,Experts say what Covid-19 and Kawasaki syndrome have in common is the acute immune response, or cytokine storm, that they trigger, which makes in the body go into shock.“These children have had a severe and prolonged inflammatory response to Covid-19 infection and they have not had severe lung disease, unlike the majority of cases in adults,” Dr Nazima Pathan, a consultant in paediatric intensive care in Cambridge, told The Guardian.“Whilst this is an evolving situation, it is clear that these symptoms are reported in only handfuls of cases. The important message is that if parents are worried about their children’s health, they should seek medical advice,” said Dr Pathan.Whilst children are not invulnerable to Covid-19 infection, most of them get mild disease. Initial data from China showed children were largely spared, but cases detected though contact tracing showed 13% of confirmed cases had no symptoms, and when confirmed and suspected cases were combined, almost a third of children ages 6 to 10 years were asymptomatic. Considering both confirmed and suspected cases, 32% of children aged 6-10 years were asymptomatic, shows data from China Centers of Disease Control.“Children may not even develop severe symptoms, but they are potential carriers of the virus and can spread it to others, so it is important to minimise their contact with people at risk, such as grandparents and people with existing diseases like severe asthma, diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, among others,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, head of critical care, Medanta-The Medicity, Gurugram, which was the first private hospital to begin treating Covid-19 patients in India.A new study from Germany has found that children are as infectious as adults. Researchers at Charite, one of Europe’s largest university hospital in Berlin, found the virus in the respiratory tract, which is the main route of virus transmission, is not significantly different across age groups.chidlren account for less than 1% (0.6%) of people hospitalised with severe illness. According to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, infants appear most likely to be hospitalised, but death remains extremely rare.Signs of trouble in young childrenLooking paleAbnormally cold to the touchPaused or irregular breathing (apnoea), grunting soundsDifficulty in breathingBlue lipsFit/seizuresCrying inconsolablyLethargy, unresponsivenessRash that does not disappear with pressure (Glass test)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/does-coronavirus-affect-children-differently/story-uDL9ru1GFQFsvWSznYOROM.html
