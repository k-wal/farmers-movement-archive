08-05-2020||News||It is time to reset India’s approach to the environment||On Thursday, a gas leak from a polymer plant in Vizag killed 12 people. Hundreds were hospitalised; thousands exposed and evacuated. According to reports, the company, by its own admission in May 2019, didn’t have a valid environmental clearance. On the same day, seven workers were hospitalised due to a gas leak at a paper mill in Raigarh, Chhattisgarh. The question we ask after every disaster is: Could it have been avoided? An even better question to ask is: How can environmental damage be avoided before it happens?In March, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) delivered an elaborate judgment on illegal mining. In Dukalu Ram vs the Union of India, the court found Jindal Power Limited and Coal India Limited guilty of illegal mining in Raigarh, imposing ~160 crore as the cost for environmental damages. Significantly, the court’s order sets a template for what constitutes environmental damage, a concept worth exploring in greater depth.India has said protecting the environment is desirable, and has led by hosting international meetings such as the Conference of the Parties for the Convention on Biological Diversity (2012), the United Nations Conference to Combat Desertification (2019) and the Convention on Migratory Species (2020). But we are yet to decide what constitutes damage to the environment.This assumes greater significance as the Government of India is reworking its Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification. Such assessments are done to find out the impact a project has on the environment. Getting environmental clearances depends on this assessment. The 2020 EIA draft introduces a host of changes, introducing the concept of post-facto clearance. This means that projects that did not apply for EIAs and environmental clearances — and subsequently started construction or are up and running — will be appraised and may receive clean chits. If found to be run in a “sustainable” fashion, they will be allowed to apply for environmental clearances. If found to be damaging the environment, closure of the project or other actions will be recommended.But what is environmental damage? The 2020 draft says the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) should set the criteria for damage assessment and remediation. The CPCB was created in 1974 under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act; it also carries out functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. Thus, the CPCB’s mandate relates to maintaining clean water and air and preventing their pollution. Yet, though pollution or leaks are one of the most visible indicators of environmental damage, they aren’t the only ones. In this regard, the NGT order is illustrative. The order found illegal mining to be harmful to the environment on counts of waste dumping, proximity to residences, causing the drying up of ponds, air pollution through poor transport of coal, loss of groundwater (this amounts to degradation), lack of provision of health care, and loss of ecological services.The most significant in the case of long-term damage is the loss of ecological or ecosystem services. Ecosystem services refer to the services provided by healthy nature, which include things like pollination, quality of life, bio-filtration and more. In the Raigarh mines, apart from the usual complaints of air and water pollution, villagers complained of “raging fires” at the mining sites that caused turbidity and affected their health.A few things should be kept in mind. First, the EIA notification draft should broaden the scope and understanding of environmental damage, beyond just pollution. Environmental damage, including purported long-term damage to ecological services, should be part of the assessment and the EIA notification.Second, the world after the coronavirus pandemic has shown us that several human-led activities create novel interfaces that further lead to consequences we can’t control, such as viruses caused by the disturbance to wildlife. We are also seeing how pristine the environment is without our interventions. The images released by NASA reveal that the air over the northern Gangetic plain is the cleanest it has been in 20 years. This clear view gives us a chance to plan projects in a way that actively protects the environment rather than “balances” it against political goals.Finally, if we can put India under lockdown, and run offices remotely, it means we can indeed do the impossible as long as political and societal will exists for it. A clean environment — on the heels of an ongoing pandemic — is a social goal, as much as one mandated by international conventions. This is the time to put trust in science and technical expertise, and create a broader understanding of what environmental damage is. Once we fully map it, we can set about preventing it.We tend to pray after environmental catastrophe strikes. But we need more than thoughts and prayers to institutionalise environmental protection. This is the best time to understand how environmental damage impacts ecological services, and how this should reflect in the EIA processes. As we pick up the pieces left behind from a virus, we must plan to avoid more environmental grief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/it-is-time-to-reset-india-s-approach-to-the-environment/story-8Ya15cIZKBb0xmN59q0OhO.html
08-05-2020||News||The indispensability of labour in reviving India’s economic engine | Opinion||Migrant workers are like nowhere people. Yet, they are everywhere. From high-rises to highways, who builds them? It is a silent army of migrant workers, working day and night with no job security, no social safety net, and poor living conditions — yet, theirs are not the names we see on the billboards or the foundation stones of these shining symbols of India’s economic progress. From domestic helps to drivers, from the vegetable seller to the roadside food stall or kirana store owners — their names are not on any payroll or pension plans or tax registers and yet, remove them and life in urban and semi-urban areas would be paralysed. Like now.Invisible, taken for granted, they are treated with indifference in the best of times and callousness and cruelty in the worst, as the spectacle of migrant workers walking hundreds of miles on hot and dusty roads to go back home showed. It evoked the words from the Woody Guthrie song, “I ain’t got no home in this world anymore”. For some of them, this proved to be literally and tragically true, whether due to death or the hostile reception they faced back home. They left their homes in search of a better life, to support their families back home. Yet, their adopted homes did not own them up when the chips were down.Perhaps the human tragedy involved here will not move everyone equally. Even if the human plight does move us, some may take a more pragmatic point of view — what matters most is dealing with the public health crisis first, and then restarting the engine of growth. Now, what is this engine of growth? You might think that it is capital accumulation — new machines and factories — and productivity growth — better technology and organisational methods. But capital cannot generate output on its own — it needs labour. In a country like India, it comes mainly through migrant labourers from rural areas. The engine of growth runs on the fuel of migrant labour, which moves from less productive sectors like agriculture to more productive sectors like manufacturing and services. Without this fuel, the engine will sputter and stop because of upward pressure on wages in the limited pool of local labour markets. What drives the flow of migration is the prospect of better opportunities in urban areas. Interestingly, research on migration shows that there is, in fact, significant under-migration compared to the potential labour supply from rural areas. The main factor cited is risk-aversion. While average incomes are lower in rural areas, villagers can eke out a living easily and rely on strong informal safety nets based on social networks. Very poor households may be unwilling to incur the financial and psychological costs of migration and brave the subsistence risk of things not panning out. The horrifying experience of migrant workers during this crisis will only magnify such fears and reinforce the tendency towards under-migration.What does this imply for the post-lockdown period? Could we simply press a button and restart the engine of growth, as Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, seems to suggest for the United States (US) economy? Bernanke said that the current economic crisis is closer to a major snowstorm or a natural disaster than to a 1930s-style Depression, which came from problems of human institutions and monetary and financial shocks. So, he has predicted a sharp recession and a quick recovery for the US. Whether Bernanke’s prediction about the US is right remains to be seen, but his logic does not apply to a developing country like India where informal institutions and social networks play a much larger role in the economy than in a developed country. While trust and reputation are important in every economic sphere, these are the only currency in the informal sector where there are no contracts and regulations, and hiring is based on word-of-mouth referrals (think, for example, how domestic workers are hired). Therefore, social networks play a big role as reputation in the community acts as a bond against potential malfeasance or low productivity. But trust takes time to build, as do social networks once they are disrupted. Therefore, the assumption that after the crisis subsides, things will return to normal and an unlimited supply of labour will flow in from the countryside is unrealistic. Wages will have to rise significantly, and networks that underpin informal labour markets will have to reform for the process to resume. Employers are clearly seeing the writing on the wall. Therefore, we see attempts like the construction industry lobbying a state government to cancel trains to stop migrant workers from heading back home.The same logic of the market that is often invoked to say there are no free lunches when talking about relief packages for the poor, also says the only way to induce labour to work is through improvement in wages and living and work conditions, not coercion. And given that 90% of the Indian workforce is in the informal sector with no job security or benefits, the safety net provided by the government must be strengthened to attract migrant workers back after this ordeal.At the minimum, this would involve making ration cards portable so that migrant workers are covered by the public distribution system (PDS) and committing significantly more resources (than in the relief package announced earlier) to direct cash transfers and to the PDS. There are no free lunches. The economy will not move forward unless the migrant workers come back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-indispensability-of-labour-in-reviving-india-s-economic-engine/story-SN06z8SlkZYnuVtVKnvqOL.html
08-05-2020||News||It’s time to make migrant workers’ concerns an electoral issue||Since the announcement of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) lockdown, a huge number of migrant workers have left their places of work for their homes. There is no official count on the number, but estimates suggest that it could be about half a million. According to Parliamentary records, India has about 100 million migrant workers. How could an executive decision, so wide in its repercussions, fail to account for such a large number of its own citizens?It may have answers in our political discourse – especially the migrants’ place in it. Because they are on the move, they are never treated as a “vote bank”. It is now a pejorative reference to a captive electorate that historically votes en masse, usually pegged to allegiance to their caste (or class in the West), religion, and colour. Antithetical to that group are “swing voters”, who show no such fidelity, are hard to woo and hard to keep, but ultimately decide the election’s outcome.India’s migrant workers are neither a vote bank nor a swing vote – most of the time, they cast no vote at all. That exacerbates their vulnerabilities more than factors such as earnings in which they greatly outstrip their peers back in the village. The Representation of People’s Act, 1951 requires the casting of votes at the place of registration. A vote, however, can be transferred, but the process is not that simple. By the time the formalities are completed, or the next election comes around, the migrant may have moved to another city in search of the next opportunity. In cities such as Mumbai, the dominant nativist agenda discourages migrants from enrolling or transferring their votes to the megacity. Political leaders don’t tailor their agendas to address migrant workers’ concerns. Even mainstream parties such as the Bhartiya Janata Party or the Congress did not subsume the migrant’s enfranchisement as an agenda in their manifesto for the last general election.The Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act, 1979, which aimed to protect migrant workers’ interest, served its cause well for its first decade of operation. But in 1990-91, when India faced its greatest pre-Covid-19 economic crises, labor laws were significantly watered down to allow for the rapid industrialisation. Trade union politics that had hitherto brought out successful politicians – George Fernandes, for example – were forced to find other biddings. India’s employee provident fund has a mere 45 million active users across private and public establishments. Despite the 1979 Act requiring the creation of a central registry of migrant workers, the Union labour minister told the Parliament a year ago that the government maintains no such database.Freedom to move freely, live and settle in any part of India is guaranteed as a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution. Interstate movement of the workforce is not only the lifeline of the India’s famed demographic dividend but also a dividend of federalism where state governments compete with each other on socioeconomic policies to attract more skilled workforce.In the now legendry case of Indira Gandhi v/s Raj Narain, the Supreme Court’s Justice HR Khanna had opined that free and fair election is an essential element of a democracy – with successive judgments emphasising on that principal. But how free is an election that effectively disenfranchises nearly 8% of its population for the simple fault of exercising their fundamental right to migrate within the country?A 2015 Tata Institute of Social Sciences report correlated that states with higher rates of migration are associated with lower voter turnouts. In order to facilitate electoral participation of migrant workers, the report called for a national consultation on early voting, postal ballot, proxy voting, and electronic voting – early and alternative voting systems widely used in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia. Palagummi Sainath, the founder of the People’s Archive of Rural India, has suggested that, to include the migrant votes, elections should be timed with the harvest season. It has precedence. The Election Commission of India has in the past made successful voting provisions for Kashmiri migrants, Jammu’s Talwara migrants, and Mizoram’s Reangs.Nothing can justify the exclusion of the tens of millions of our own citizens from the political bargain of India. Migrants should fight to port their votes wherever they go, and we, in solidarity, should corral for those rights.Kabeer Shrivastava is advocate, Delhi High CourtThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/it-s-time-to-make-migrant-workers-concerns-an-electoral-issue/story-QyT6sootXn5xxS069DWX0H.html
08-05-2020||News||How Covid-19 can affect India’s energy transition goals||As we stare down the Covid-19 pandemic, the crisis has put the trend towards an energy transition at risk. While some fear that the transition may be left flat, others are optimistic that it will get supercharged by this cataclysm. India moved to the forefront of the global energy transition with a target of 175-gigawatt (GW) renewable energy (RE) capacity by 2022. This is likely to undergo an upgrade to 450 GW by 2030. Simultaneously, policy interventions are being planned to push electric vehicles, energy storage, smart grids and other modern energy technologies and practices. Will the pandemic-induced economic contraction topple India’s energy transition priorities? First, disruptions in the global supply chain for clean energy technologies is a key impediment. A long-haul to restoration will not only cause delays but also increase component costs by eliminating global manufacturing surplus. India, with modest 3 GW manufacturing capacity, depends on Chinese manufacturers for about 80% of our solar cells and modules. Chinese manufacturers and India’s ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) are hopeful of a speedy revival. The ministry has offered a blanket extension of the lockdown period plus 30 days to ongoing projects and is making efforts to ease the movement of materials. Besides, MNRE has sought land sites suitable for RE manufacturing and export services hubs. Second, the downtrend in fossil fuel prices and demand shrinks the cost advantage RE has gained in recent years. Crude oil prices have declined, even gone negative for one memorable day, while coal prices are also under pressure. For example, India’s kerosene subsidy bill came down to zero in March and the LPG subsidy cost (exluding the three free refills being provided to Ujjwala consumers during the lockdown) reduced to nearly zero in May. The coal ministry has removed surcharges, quantity restrictions, and advance payment requirements to maintain demand, and may even cut prices. The government continues its protective impulse on coal – seeking to maintain production, substituting coal import and promote sales – likely because workers, some poorer states, and key sectors like railways are heavily dependent on the coal economy. By contrast, the Centre seized the moment with the oil price drop to increase the excise duty on petrol and diesel to boost tax revenues. Will the net effect government’s use of tax and subsidy instruments benefit fossils or work to keep RE cost competitive?Third, global capital has been increasingly enthusiastic about an energy transition but the pandemic may open alternative investment opportunities. India’s RE development has largely been financed by foreign and private capital that may shrink if the pandemic worsens. Domestic public capital, constrained by lock-ins to non-performing energy assets, have limited capability to finance energy transition. Will the RE transition suffer for want of financing? Fourth, the decline in electricity demand will likely shrink the space for new RE. Distribution utilities are struggling to keep up with surplus power purchase contracts. In the wake of the lockdown, a few states attempted to invoke force majeure clause and stop withdrawal from RE plants. However, the Centre mandated ‘must-run’ status and regular payments for RE in order to keep it going. Further, India signalled its continued support for RE by completing tenders for 2 GW of solar power even amid the lockdown. The government could go even further by retiring old and polluting coal plants to create space for RE. The Centre’s efforts to protect RE are important signals in favour of sustaining the energy transition. Further, a draft bill to amend the Electricity Act, notified amid the lockdown, may add additional safeguards, such as provisions for a national RE policy, stricter compliance mechanism for renewable purchase obligation, and an Electricity Contract Enforcement Authority that may protect RE and other generators from threats of reneging. Beyond these prompt signals, India needs a strategic approach to sustain the transition to a 21st century energy future. Here are three key steps in that direction:First, while firm national targets are essential, the centralised approach to enforcement in the proposed amendment is misplaced. It is crucial to engage with political economic opportunities and constraints in the states and let the states chart their transition pathways. While the Centre should focus on creating incentives, the states must step up to tap them and unwind the chronic lock-ins. For example, the transition offers opportunities to manage the rising burden of recurring tariff subsidy on the states through one-time support to clean energy infrastructure for the poor.Second, in planning the post-Covid-19 recovery, energy transition could be a catalytic force for rebooting the economy while redirecting energy in the direction of more resilience. For example, we need more health infrastructure, to manage the health emergency, that can be energy resilient through decentralised clean energy. Finally, the pandemic is exacerbating the weaknesses in India’s electricity system, thus causing tensions in the transition. Both fossil and RE systems will need stimulus to sustain the impacts. It is not a question of which technology to support, but a choice between different configurations of technology, politics and institutions. Our focus should not be on restoring the pre-Covid configuration and underlying low-level equilibrium in electricity. Rather, we must use this critical juncture to push for positive reforms and overdue structural changes to build a resilient electricity future.

08-05-2020||News||Covid-19: Despite difficult circumstances, police personnel are doing their best to keep you safe||The coronavirus pandemic has compelled many nations to take tough measures that require a strong police force to enforce them. Many police personnel are executing this sort of enforcement for the first time in their careers. They have to deal not just with crimes, but also with panic-stricken crowds, emotionally charged and fearful people, trying to walk home or buy essential supplies. The other task that the police have to undertake are enforcing movement restrictions, checking valid passes, ensuring the movement of essential goods, guarding quarantine centres and escorting people who have contracted the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Besides all these, they have to keep an eye on hoarders, rumour-mongers as well as those trapped in their homes due to old age or disabilities. In Punjab, the police helped a woman deliver her baby. In Panchkula, the police turned up at a senior citizen’s home to celebrate his birthday as he had no one else to celebrate it with. In many places, like in Kerala, the police have been feeding stray and abandoned animals. The police force has shown exceptional resilience even when subjected to harsh words and physical attacks like being spat upon, pelted with stones, or even in some places, when people tried to run them down with their vehicles. The most horrendous was the instance when a religious sect clashed with the police in Patiala and during the scuffle chopped off the hand of an assistant sub-inspector. I am not trying to say that the police are beyond reproach but they are just as susceptible to emotions and fears as anyone else. Some police personnel has tested positive for the virus, some of them in Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra have lost their lives. The lockdown that is being enforced by the police has helped in preventing the spread of the disease, in isolating cases, contact tracing and quarantining. Among the states, Himachal Pradesh has received appreciation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi for its efforts in contact tracing, surveillance, and quarantining. The state police have been tracking all those entering the state from hotspots and their contacts.Dealing with Una district, which has a porous border with Punjab and is a gateway to four more districts of Himachal Pradesh, was a challenging exercise. The district reported 16 out of the total of 40 Covid-19 cases in the state on April 30. The district set up 25 inter-state barriers with the adjoining state. Una reported its first positive case on April 2, its share being three out of six cases in the state. Further contact tracing of these cases led to the creation of a pool of around 300 people for testing.The efficiency of the police in contact tracing could be judged from one of those 14 cases that were reported on April 11. The movement of the coronavirus-positive person showed no change during night time but there was some fluctuation during the day time. During a telephonic investigation, he revealed that he did not meet anyone before testing positive. However, the district police chose to investigate further and, with the help of locals and village heads, traced four of his friends whom he had met before he was tested. Those four people were also tested and one of them turned out to be positive. This one case could have infected many others if not for the rigorous tracing by the police.So the next time, you read articles or hear reports critical of the police, do also remember that we try and do as much as we can under these difficult circumstances to keep you safe and well.

08-05-2020||News||How the Covid-19-induced lockdown has changed me||It is astounding to learn, how few people matter in our lives. We tend to get so tied up in knots with our daily work schedules, gym, chanting, party routines and trying to make ourselves look “good” for others (mostly on social media). As a result, we ignore the people who matter to us and whom we should care about. Be it the elderly in our family, spouse, children, close friends and even those with whom you have spent precious times. We are so busy chasing a future that we have forgotten how to live and enjoy the present. We are so filled with greed and unfulfilled desires that we forget to count our blessings. Most of us have big egos and a false sense of pride and self-importance that we forget how to respect human beings and empathise with their suffering. If there is one thing my late mother taught me, it is compassion for others. To do your deed or service without expecting anything in return. Today, I know people who are more concerned about providing stray dogs with food and shelter rather than looking at the effect the coronavirus has had on human lives. Make no mistake, I am an animal lover and a conservationist. While by all means our priority today should be protecting ourselves and our family members, but we should also extend a helping hand to elders, friends and loved ones we have lost touch with, and have a conversation with them. There are many charity funds and NGOs we can donate to so that they can take care of street children, stranded migrant labourers and homeless people. But, do donate your money wisely.I have decided to spend more time with my family and close friends and with those people who matter to me. I want to enjoy and cherish my time with them. I will limit my social circle accordingly and live life on my terms. I don’t care two hoots about how the world perceives me. I will do all the things I have always wanted to do: Spend more time with nature, enjoy the wilderness of Ladakh, our national parks, take photography lessons, drive to the Rann of Kutch on a moonlit night, and embark on a motorcycle tour of Bhutan.My second important discovery has got to do with how we suffer from the syndrome of obsessive consumerism. We may get over the virus over the next six months or so (wishful thinking?), but it is accepted that it may take several years to recover from the economic fallout of this crisis. I don’t know how many of us realise how deeply this is going to impact each one of us. We have two options; change our lifestyle that revolves around obsessive consumerism or go down the spiral. It’s a no-brainer. During the lockdown, I was pleasantly surprised to see how little we need to go on reasonably comfortably with our daily lives. Be it cars, household stuff, gadgets, food supplies and toiletries. Not to mention the array of expensive garments, shoes and other accessories we are constantly acquiring. And yet, we never stop collecting more and more and more. We do this because we want to show off to the world how up-to-date, fashionable and wealthy we are.I am going to make a conscious effort to move away from this negative pattern. We are living in times where we need to both “preserve” and “conserve”. I have decided to reduce my financial burden to whatever extent possible. Perhaps, it’s time for all of us to review the same.Last, I am thoroughly enjoying the clean Delhi air, crystal clear blue skies, the chirping of birds, the sight of peacocks and squirrels. No traffic and no noise pollution with horns blaring and people shouting and screaming at each other. After decades, I have not suffered a devastating asthma attack that invariably occurs during the months of April-May. I like to take some time off in the evening to stand out in my verandah and enjoy the sounds of nature and the beauty that surrounds us, despite living in a megacity like Delhi.Today, my worry is of another kind. I am beginning to ask myself the question: Do I want to live in Delhi once the lockdown is over?Vikramaditya Singh is former Member of J&K Legislative Council.The views expressed are final||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-the-covid-19-induced-lockdown-has-changed-me/story-mw4AtmX89pjjIVf7HexPoM.html
08-05-2020||Mumbai||World Migratory Bird Day: Return rate of tagged birds highest in Mumbai: BNHS||More tagged or ringed migratory birds return to roosting and feeding sites in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai than any other region in India.Bird ringing is done by clipping a bird with a small metal ring to study and understand the routes they use to fly, their migration patterns and resting sites.Of 10,803 individuals of migratory shore-birds across 46 species ringed in the Mumbai region between 2014 and 2020 (majorly from 2018 onwards) with a recapture rate - recording a ringed bird from the same spot where it was tagged - of 4.6% (497 birds), according to Maharashtra’s nodal agency for bird ringing studies, the Bombay Natural History Society that released data ahead of the 15th World Migratory Bird Day on Saturday. The high rate of birds flocking back show that inter-tidal mudflats in the Mumbai region provide essential feeding grounds for thousands of migratory birds and need to be protected, said researchers.“The recapture rate is significantly higher than otherwise recorded for bird ringing studies in India. The high recapture data is attributed to very high site fidelity for these migratory birds and intensive efforts of bird ringing over a long period,” said Deepak Apte, director, BNHS.More recent data from November 2019 to January 2020 showed 3,453 birds ringed by BNHS across wetlands near Bhandup pumping station in Mumbai, the Thane creek and TS Chanakya wetlands in Navi Mumbai. Of these, 3,415 were small waders and 38 flamingos with 160 recaptures during the exercise. Most of these winged visitors descend to Mumbai after spending the summer in Arctic Russia, said BNHS.“This kind of data repository is not available along the west coast for any location so far, including the Gujarat, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala coast, which witnesses the highest bird numbers,” said Apte.According to BNHS, a shore-bird ringed on the west coast of India carries a metal ring in one leg and two-coloured flags (one with alphanumeric engraving and another blank) in the other leg. The position of ring and flag also changes according to the year they are tagged. The left leg carries the metal ring during the odd year and right leg carries coloured flags and vice-versa for even year.BNHS also collated 376 resighting records (tagged birds spotted rather than checked for details like alphanumeric engraving) from birders and wildlife photographers. “Mark-recapture studies with migratory shorebirds have always proven to give low recapture rate and hence resighting records are also considered as recapture,” said Rahul Khot, assistant director, BNHS. “Interestingly, 80% of the recaptures recorded by us were from the sites where the birds were tagged. For example, a bird ringed in 2014 at Panje wetland in Uran was recaptured in 2018 in Panje even after four years.”Apart from the Lesser and Greater flamingos, birds ringed by BNHS include a large number of waders such as Little Stint, Curlew sandpiper, Lesser Sandplover, Common Redshank, and Black-tailed Godwit whereas rare species included Red-necked Phalarope, Spotted Redshank, and Bar-tailed Godwit.Independent experts concurred with BNHS’ findings. “The global recapture rate is around 2-3%, and this indicates that these Mumbai wetlands need to be conserved. However, we must try to understand how the migratory birds use these mudflats, whether they are becoming their winter homes permanently or these are stopover points for their final destination,” said Dr Asad Rahmani, member, Wetlands International South Asia and former director, BNHS.Sunjoy Monga, ornithologist said, “The findings are accurate. A sizeable ringed population of birds frequenting key wetland sites annually makes it a clear case for protection of these wetlands.”World Migratory Bird DayIn 2006, the United Nations decided to celebrate the second weekend of May every year as World Migratory Bird Day in order to raise awareness about the migratory birds and their linkages between different regions across the globe. Every year a unique theme is chosen. This year’s theme is ‘Birds connect our World’, which was chosen to highlight the importance of conserving and restoring the ecological connectivity and integrity of ecosystems that support the natural cycles essential for the survival and well-being of migratory birds. During their annual cycle, flyways are used by birds for breeding, stopover, and wintering zones. Globally, nine migratory flyways have been identified under the Convention of Migratory Species (CMS). CAF is one of them covering migratory bird routes across 30 countries with maximum routes passing through India.SOME INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT THE MIGRATORY BIRDSThe highest flyer: Bar-headed Geese travel every year from their breeding grounds in China and Mongolia to India and while doing so they cross the Himalayas, flying above 29,000 feet. No other bird is able to do so.The longest non-stop flyer: Bar-tailed Godwits are able to fly non-stop from Alaska to New Zealand during which they cover a staggering 11,000 km within six days. Before embarking on this journey around 55% of their body weight is stored as fats to power this tiring journey.The all-time record holder: Arctic terns travel from the North Pole to South Pole and back. Studies indicate that on an average they travel up to 70,900 km annually. In their lifetime they would complete the distance equivalent to going to the Moon and back three times.(Source: Siddhesh Surve, assistant director (capacity building), Maharashtra Mangrove Foundation)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/world-migratory-bird-day-return-rate-of-tagged-birds-highest-in-mumbai-bnhs/story-nbK2p5ssix87jrRRdDAZLP.html
08-05-2020||Lucknow||Yogi urges migrants not to walk, cycle home||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has appealed to migrant workers not to walk or travel by bicycle on their way home as doing so could put their health and safety at risk.The chief minister issued the appeal after reviewing the return of migrant workers, additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi said at a press conference on Friday.His appeal came on a day 16 migrants were crushed under a goods train in Maharashtra when they were sleeping on rail tracks during their return home in Madhya Pradesh. They had fallen asleep on the tracks due to exhaustion after walking for several kilometres.The chief minister also said the state government was arranging for the safe return of every worker and labourer in coordination with all the state governments, the senior bureaucrat informed.On the chief minister’s instructions, Shramik Special trains were being operated regularly for Uttar Pradesh. Till Friday, 69 trains had either arrived or were en route to UP, the official said. These trains arrived at railway stations in 40 districts of the state. Around 76 trains will reach UP in the next two days.“When so many trains are coming, the CM said there is no need for anyone to walk to reach home and they should come back as per the proper arrangement made for them,” Awasthi said.“Today (Friday), 11 trains have arrived, and 16 more will reach by night. They will together bring about 30,000 people from different parts of the country in a day,” he said.The chief minister has ordered officials to keep UPSRTC buses available in every district. About 10,000 UPSRTC buses had been deployed during the Covid-19 crisis. It was a record that such a large number of people were being sent home on trains and buses, he said.Awasthi stressed that Uttar Pradesh was ready to bring back all those willing to return if the state they were currently staying provided a detailed list and health certificate of the migrants.The senior government official said the return of migrants from Sharjah by air on Saturday was also discussed during the meeting. An Air India flight with around 200 Indians from Sharjah is scheduled to arrive in Lucknow on Saturday. The Indian government on Monday had announced plans to begin a phased repatriation of its citizens stranded abroad from May 7.Awasthi said another flight that landed in Delhi on Friday carried 20 people from Ghaziabad and Noida. The chief minister had said those coming from abroad should be screened and kept in quarantine centres before they could be allowed to go home, the senior official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/yogi-urges-migrants-not-to-walk-cycle-home/story-GeJ53hkF2XUTvbJs3cUXyO.html
08-05-2020||City||City residents throng Bhiwandi villages for liquor||After the municipal corporations in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) refused to allow liquor shops to remain open, residents of Thane and Kalyan are thronging shops in Bhiwandi rural.Liquor shops opened in these villages on Monday. As the other municipal corporations did a U-turn on the decision, the gram panchayats have not passed any such order.But most shops are seeing a huge crowd of people from nearby cities who come to buy alcohol. Local villagers said that social distancing rule is not followed and suddenly their village has a lot of crowd.On Friday, some of the gram panchayats wrote to the tehsildar and the police complaining about the problem. They are worried about spread of Covid-19.“We have received complaints from gram panchayats in Bhiwandi. No rules are followed although we have special police protection in these spots and have asked shops to maintain social distancing. We have written to the excise department too. After taking their opinion, we will take a call on keeping liquor shops open,” said Shashikant Gaikwad, tehsildar, Bhiwandi rural.Villagers from areas such as Kalher, Dapoda and Shelar want the liquor shops in their areas to shut. “Our village does not have any coronavirus case so we don’t want so many people coming in just to buy liquor,” said Ravindra Gundolkar, sarpanch, Shelar village.The residents had initially tried to request the liquor shop owners to shut the shop but they did not. So, they complained to the local authorities.“People from other places come in their private vehicles and buy cartons of liquor. They do not follow social distancing and crowd the areas,” said Sanjay Dudhe, 43, a resident of Kalher, Bhiwandi rural.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/city-residents-throng-bhiwandi-villages-for-liquor/story-JUOylQfqPcp2nuSJdliwEK.html
08-05-2020||Mumbai||10 foreigners who attended Tablighi Jamaat event get bail||The sessions court on Friday granted bail to 10 Indonesian nationals who had been arrested in April for allegedly failing to disclose the details of their participation at the Tablighi Jamaat gathering in Nizamuddin Markaz, Delhi.The 10 accused had earlier been denied bail by the metropolitan magistrate court on Monday, following which they had approached the sessions court.Their lawyer, Ishrat Khan, pleaded that the charges of attempt to murder and culpable homicide not amounting to murder do not apply to the case. It was also submitted that the 10 were tested negative for Covid-19.Public prosecutor Ramesh Shiroya had objected their bail plea on the ground that the accused did not abide by the orders of the authorities and did not come forward to admit that they had attended the event. The prosecution also argued that the accused knew about the spread of virus in their country, despite which they entered India, and two other group members were found infected.The court however, accepted the argument of the defence lawyer and granted bail to the 10 accused.According to the case registered by Bandra police, 12 people including the 10 arrested, had visited Delhi from Indonesia in March for the religious meet. After attending the event, they came to Mumbai on March 7 and were staying at an apartment in Bandra.Two members of this group were kept in quarantine, after they were tested positive for Covid-19. Khan had approached the court for their pre-arrest bail before the quarantine period ended. The two now are granted interim protection from arrest and their plea is scheduled for hearing on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/10-foreigners-who-attended-tablighi-jamaat-event-get-bail/story-ynT3pXKtgVD2fSusWfG9ZP.html

Asha (accredited social health activists), anganwadi workers, and volunteers of Yuvak Mangal Dal will be the committee members.In urban areas, the ward councilor will head the surveillance committee. Asha workers, civil defence members and representatives of Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) will be members of this committee there.The surveillance committee will alert the district administration and health teams if they detect the Covid symptoms among migrants or if the migrants violate Covid guidelines during home quarantine, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-local-panels-to-watch-migrants-in-home-quarantine/story-kXUe09JFJBobYOvJitIAeP.html

High-risk persons have been shifted to a quarantine facility in Charkop.”Patil added the forest guard (security staff) had been admitted to a local Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) hospital for a few days, during the first week of April, owing to a paralysis triggered by a brain haemorrhage. “He was transferred to Sir JJ Hospital where he was admitted for almost a month. After complications with his treatment, he was shifted to KEM. His condition deteriorated earlier this week, and he passed away on Wednesday. Blood samples collected before his death were retested and detected to be positive for the virus,” said Patil.High risk contacts include his family and neighbours regularly visiting him at the hospital. “We will be daily visiting the hamlet to check their health since the mobile network is not available at the pada,” said Patil.SGNP has close to 35,000 tribal residents living across 56 hamlets.Naresh Zarmure, chief conservator of forest (additional charge), SGNP said, “This is the first quarantined zone inside SGNP, though several areas have been sealed along the periphery outside the park.”Zarmure added that the park has been shut for visitors for two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tribal-village-of-sgnp-declared-containment-zone-after-guard-tests-positive/story-Tt08J34Gpjr8iaaLANTjWP.html

08-05-2020||Bangalore||Covid-19: Karnataka records biggest single-day spike of 48 cases||Karnataka witnessed its biggest single biggest spike of Covid-19 positive cases on Friday with 48 new patients being reported from the state, taking its tally to 753 cases. This includes 30 deaths from coronavirus disease and 376 discharges.However, the government said that while there was a spike in cases, the number of treated and discharged Covid-19 patients were still more than the active cases in the state.Data shows that it has been the deep interior districts like Davangere and Belgavi which have seen a huge increase in the number of Covid-19 positive cases.Meanwhile, after a three-day stoppage and confusion about logistics, the South Western Railway on Friday ran three Shramik Special trains from the state- two to Lucknow and one to Patna – ferrying 3,500 stranded workers back to their states.“Today, the Shramik Special to Lucknow departed at 4.25 pm from Chikkabanavara station with 1,200 passengers on board, second one left Malur at 5.45 pm carrying 1,200 adults and seven children to Danapur (Bihar) and the third train to Lucknow departed from Malur at 7.55 pm with 1,198 passengers on board,” the SWR said in a statement, reports PTI.Till now, the South Western Railways has run 10 Shramik trains from Karnataka to different parts of India.State government officials claimed that the confusion was because a number of other states like West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and a few others were yet to give consent to receiving migrants who hail from their states.However, even on Friday migrants looking to return had to pay a ticket charge of Rs 1,050 despite the earlier claims of the state government that the journey would be free of charge.When asked about this, Karnataka primary and secondary education minister speaking at a media interaction, said “Our intention is not to collect the charges, let me find out (why) it is being done.”A delegation of opposition leaders including the leader of opposition in assembly Siddaramiah, leader of opposition in council SR Patil, KPCC president DK Shivakumar, JD(S) state president HK Kumaraswamy, former minister HD Revanna and others met with chief minister BS Yediyurappa and submitted a list of demands and suggestions about what the government could do better to tackle the current Covid-19 situation.Speaking to the media later, Congress leader DK Shivakumar criticised the economic stimulus package announced by the chief minister as ‘too little and not encompassing all sections of the society.’ Stating that some of the BJP legislators were playing politics by displaying their photos and party symbol on government relief material, Shivakumar said that this was “unbecoming” (of them).Former chief minister Siddaramiah too criticised the actions of the Yediyurappa government, saying that the Centre should release at least Rs 50,000 crore as a special package for the state. He added that the government should step in and either purchase or announce support prices for vegetables, flowers and fruits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/covid-19-karnataka-records-biggest-single-day-spike-of-48-cases/story-9igIOg6JY1hFNenUIPAGyO.html
08-05-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects Covid-positive PNB accused’s temporary bail plea||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday rejected plea for temporary bail by Hemant Bhatt, one of the accused in the multi-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud, after the 66-year-old tested positive for Covid-19.Justice Bharati Dangre rejected Bhatt’s plea in view of the fact that a Covid-19 patient can’t be allowed to be freed on temporary bail, and said that Bhatt will be required to be treated at a government hospital.Acting on Bhatt’s plea, justice Dangre had on May 6 directed a public prosecutor to make a statement about the situation with regards to Covid-19 infection in Arthur Road jail.Bhatt, in his plea filed through advocate Kiran Padalkar, said, “The applicant is aged 66 years and is a chronic heart patient who has undergone by-pass surgery, has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease and is also suffering from hypertension.” Bhatt had sought interim bail citing the Supreme Court’s directives to states and Union Territories to decongest prisons in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.However, counsel for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Hiten Venegaonkar, opposed the plea stating that pursuant to the directives of the apex Court, a high-power committee constituted by the state government has decided to grant temporary bail only to the prisoners charged with offences punishable with not more than seven years imprisonment, and Bhatt’s case did not fall under the purview of the same.Justice Dangre had, however, noted the apprehension expressed by the accused because of his health condition along with the ongoing pandemic, and directed the public prosecutor to make the statement on Friday.Accordingly, additional public prosecutor Shahaji Shinde on Friday informed the court that a number of inmates and some staff members of Arthur Road jail have tested positive for the infection and Bhatt was among the inmates who tested positive.Bhatt has been arrested in connection the PNB fraud allegedly perpetuated by fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi. CBI has booked Bhatt and other accused under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The accused have also been booked by the Enforcement Directorate under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-rejects-covid-positive-pnb-accused-s-temporary-bail-plea/story-Vi6AiUvkxcSFJMpMw7u39N.html

The court has also asked the prison authorities to submit a report on the medical treatment given to him by May 15.Teltumbde was arrested by NIA on April 14 after he surrendered before the agency in Mumbai and was remanded in judicial custody by the special court on April 25. However, after the NIA officer who questioned him was found infected with Covid-19, Teltumbde was put under quarantine for 14 days, which ends on Saturday.Meanwhile, the defence urged the court to grant him proper medical aid as he suffers from several ailments. On Friday, when the case came up for the hearing, the court was informed that Teltumbde has been kept under quarantine in a hospital. After hearing the concerns, the court has asked the prison authority to respond to the plea and file a detailed reply by May 15.NIA has claimed that Teltumbde had links with banned outfit the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and is also suspected to have received funds from the organisation. The central agency has contended that the activist gave “provocative presentation and speeches on December 31, 2017, during an event at Shaniwarwada, Pune, which led to violence resulting in loss of life and state-wide agitation”.The agency has further claimed that Teltumbde was the convener of the program and that his call data records show he was in touch with the other arrested accused in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-nia-court-extends-judicial-custody-of-dr-anand-teltumbde-till-may-22/story-xYeQGyCwrcxvFoOqVcYq4L.html
08-05-2020||Mumbai||Publicise free medical screening scheme for migrants: HC to state||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the state to publicise its scheme for free medical screening of migrant workers, who want to return to their hometowns, at the point of boarding. The HC’s directive came while it was hearing public interest litigations (PILs) wherein petitioners said the initiative of the government was not known to many. The court has also directed the state to take appropriate decision on bearing the travel expenses of the migrants. A single-judge bench of justice SC Gupte while hearing the PILs filed by several non-government organisations was informed that the homeless, migrants and slum-dwellers needed state support to tide over the lockdown. The plea claimed that as per the procedure laid down by the state, migrants wanting to return home had to have a medical clearance certificate to be allowed to board the transportation facility. The said the additional cost could not be borne by all migrants and urged that the state pay for it too. While answering the concerns of the petitioners regarding medical certificates, the state lawyer submitted that since May 7, the state government had discontinued the need to submit a medical certificate while seeking permission to travel. The advocate said as per the order signed by Maharashtra chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, screening of migrants would be done by government medical staff at the time of start of the journey, free of cost. Thereafter, the medical officer in-charge will issue a list of passengers who have been screened and have not displayed any influenza-like illness.However, the counsel for a petitioner submitted that this new initiative was not known to the migrants and hence, needed to be adequately publicised. Friday’s incident at Aurangabad wherein 16 migrants were run over by a goods train was also cited as a point of reference to emphasise the need to publicise the initiative.In light of the submissions, the court directed the government to give adequate publicity to free medical screenings of migrant workers and also inform the court as to who would be bearing the travel expenses of the migrants, and posted the matter for hearing in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/publicise-free-medical-screening-scheme-for-migrants-hc-to-state/story-5SzPZ7ekvsEB7260BPR8CK.html
08-05-2020||Mumbai||City’s first special train for migrants leaves for UP||The first Shramik special train for migrant workers from the city set off for Uttar Pradesh on Friday evening. The train, with around 1,200 migrant workers stranded in the city, started from Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT) in the city to Basti railway station in Uttar Pradesh. However, the train which was supposed to depart at 4pm finally left at 6.12pm.A senior Central Railway (CR) official said, “The state government was bringing the workers to LTT in buses. After inspection, they were allocated seats on the train.” The state government on Thursday relaxed the rule that made certificate from doctors mandatory to get permission to travel, and said the travellers would be checked for symptoms at the start of the journey. While similar trains were being operated from Nasik, Nagpur, Shirdi, Bhiwandi towards Uttar Pradesh, Rajashtan and Madhya Pradesh, there were no such services from Mumbai before this since the city is a red zone owing to high number of Covid-19 cases. On Friday, CR also operated special trains between Kalyan railway station and Arariya Court railway station in Bihar. Another train was operated between Shirdi and Sitapur railway station in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-s-first-special-train-for-migrants-leaves-for-up/story-TT5LcxbWd4X4WaG1Jq5bmL.html
08-05-2020||City||Amritsar cloth traders say peak season for biz passing them by||Cloth traders in the city, known for its wholesale trade that generates Rs 15,000 crore of business every summer season, are worried that peak business season that starts after wheat harvest is passing them by. With the covid-19 pandemic forcing a long lockdown and relaxation for business not coming through from the government, they say they are staring at financial ruin. Amritsar district, though, has been in a red zone and has the highest number of cases in the state. As for the cloth trade, over 5,000 wholesalers are dependent on it across 50 markets in the city. The markets around the Golden Temple, such as Katra Ahluwalia Bazaar, Tahli Sahib Bazaar, Shastri Market and Katra Jaimal Singh Bazaar are the hub for cloth trading in the state, with retailers also picking up stock.Amritsar Federation of Cloth Wholesalers chairman Jatinder Singh Bhatia says, “We are an agro-based economy. Farmers usually buy clothes after selling their produce. This has happened, but we are unable to open. We have stocked summer clothes. If we are not allowed to open our shops and outlets, we will have to bear huge losses.”He added that by June, they usually sell their summer stock, but this seemed a remote possibility this year. “Agriculture is main occupation of people in villages, but the economy of Amritsar city is based on industry and cloth trade. Agriculture has been allowed, but those living in the city have been denied relaxation,” Bhatia added. “Five percent of traders are indulging in running their businesses illegally by opening half-shutters of their shop etc. There are videos of this illicit practice, which is also hurting us. The government must allow this to function,” claimed a trader Kanwaljit Singh. Another trader Lucky Bhatia claimed, “The government expects full taxes from us, but deprives us of running our business.” Traders also claimed that the administration had demarcated shops in a single lane by labeling these A, B and C with only the shops named the same alphabet to be allowed to open twice a week. “Implementation of the system is pending,” said a trader, adding that if the situation did not improve, they would even stage protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amritsar-cloth-traders-say-peak-season-for-biz-passing-them-by/story-yqiqA5Wp8xdntluKhnDjiK.html
08-05-2020||City||Migrants prioritise who gets a ticket first||A number of migrant workers stuck at Panvel, Kamothe and adjoining areas have come up with a plan to get their passes to travel back to their hometowns amicably and based on need. The migrants have voluntarily decided to prioritise their return based on the traveller’s age and family conditions. They are also expecting that the ones who reach earlier would help them with money till they secure a place for themselves on special trains.While the workers are relieved that they will not require a medical certificate to get travel pass, they are also aware that not all of them can board the train together as each of these special trains can accommodate around 1,200 migrants at a time.“We know it very well that all of us cannot secure place in one go, hence only one person from a family or a group fills the form. This way, we also avoid crowding at police station,” said Dhumal Rao, 40, who hails from West Bengal.“We are a group of 50 people from West Bengal. We know there are many people who are trying to get travel passes like us hence, only one of us is approaching the police station for form instead of all of us. The one who reaches first will help us with money till we secure a ticket for ourselves,” said Rao.Another migrant, 37-year-old Bhupinder Singh from Bihar said, “It is not only that the one who reaches first will help us with money. Some of us are in a better position and are getting regular help, whereas others are not so fortunate. Hence, we are letting them fill the forms first.” He added that priority is also being given to families with kids as kids are at a higher risk.Babasaheb J Tupe, senior inspector, Kamothe police station, said, “The shramik special train can ferry only 1,200 passengers. We are getting applications from more and more people, but can allow only 1,200 of them as per the directive.” He added, “If they decide to prioritise among themselves, then there’s nothing better. Everyone will get a seat; they just need to be patient.” Suhash Jha, a city-based activist, said, “We are in regular contact with the migrants and are helping them with the process of securing a ticket. Larger groups have mutually decided as to who should go first. They are giving preference to each other, which is commendable.”Shramik special from Kalyan to BiharA Shramik special train was operated from Kalyan to Araria Court station in Bihar on Friday with around 1,200 migrants aboard. “Travellers were made to maintain social distancing norms, and it was ensured that all of them use masks and take all necessary precautions,” said an official from Central Railway (CR).“It was the fourth special train to be operated from Mumbai division of Central Railway. Before this, trains were operated from Bhiwandi, Panvel and Thane,” the official said.KDMC, doctors give medical certificates to 30,000 migrantsThe Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC), along with its teams of doctors, has managed to provide around 30,000 migrant workers with medical certificates till Thursday.“Till Thursday we have provided around 30,000 medical certificates to the migrant workers in KDMC vicinity. This work was carried out in last four days with the team of doctors at different centres,” said SK Ubale, nodal officer from migrant workers project, KDMC.The civic body had set up around 15 centres across its 10 wards to carry out medical check-up of the migrants to ensure the workers are not infected with Covid-19 before they travel back their hometowns.“In some wards we had to set up two centres considering the number of migrants. We are ensuring that social distancing norms are followed at all centres,” said Ubale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrants-prioritise-who-gets-a-ticket-first/story-1YZuo5rv3X69777YnvQL8N.html
08-05-2020||Mumbai||Won’t deploy Army in city, may just take help to give cops rest: Uddhav||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday dismissed rumours that the Indian Army would be deployed in Mumbai. However, he said the state may request the Centre to deploy forces to allow police personnel to take rest in phases. Thackeray admitted that although the lockdown has helped keep the spread of the virus in check, it has “not been successful in breaking the chain”.“For the past few days, rumours that ‘the Army would be deployed, a lockdown would be imposed and all shops will be shut’ have been doing the rounds. Why do we need the Army? Till date, I have done everything after taking you into confidence, and will continue to do so. We went into lockdown gradually, so we do not need the Army. We are the jawans [soldiers] in this fight. The Army will not come to Mumbai,” Thackeray said in his address on Friday evening. “The police are tired, but they are still working. Some have unfortunately died. To give them a break only when they burn out would be cruel; they also require rest in between. I want to ask the Centre if there is any way we can get additional manpower, so our police force can take breaks in phases. They can then get back to their job…Please don’t equate it to calling the Army.”Thackeray appealed to people to strictly adhere to the norms to wipe out the disease. “There are [Covid-19] cases being reported in the red zones and containment zones of Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Malegaon and Nagpur. There can be no relaxation there. The lockdown is like a speed-breaker. It has helped us reduce the speed at which the disease spreads. But we have not been successful in breaking the chain of the virus. We have to break it anyhow. How long can this lockdown go on? Now we should prepare so that the transmission and spread of this virus ends once and for all,” the CM said.The chief minister said the state was preparing for an eventuality where more hospital beds, doctors, nursing staff are required. He said the government has sought military hospital and repurposed railway coaches, along with Covid Care facilities at NSCI Dome in Worli, MMRDA Grounds in Bandra-Kurla Complex, NESCO exhibition centre in Goregaon, and Mahalaxmi Race Course. “We may double the capacity at BKC and erect such centres at other locations. We are preparing in case we need to accommodate some asymptomatic patients at these centres. We have to take into account the onset of monsoon. I had written to Centre, which has been accepted, that, if required, we should be allowed to use the services of doctors and hospital facilities of central agencies, including railways, army, Mumbai Port Trust,” Thackeray said.Thackeray also expressed pain over the accident of migrant labourers in Aurangabad. “I am pained today due to the railway accident in Jalna. We have started making arrangements for special trains to transport the migrants to their states. Don’t believe any rumour. I request you stay where you are and don’t panic,” he said.He added that the Centre, Maharashtra government and the state governments where the migrants intend to go are in touch. Speaking on the incident at Sion Hospital in Mumbai that came to light through a video, Thackeray said negligence will not be tolerated. A video went viral on Thursday where two wrapped bodies of Covid victims were kept in the ward where patients were being treated. “I can’t tolerate such negligence. I always say that the police and doctors are God for us. Nobody should fight with them and there shouldn’t be any attacks on them. Similarly, I want to tell doctors that there shouldn’t be any negligence in hospitals. When everything is going fine, don’t put us in a situation where we are forced to take action against you.”The CM also said that although the number is rising daily, the number of recovered patients is also substantial. He appealed to people to come forward in case of symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/won-t-deploy-army-in-city-may-just-take-help-to-give-cops-rest-uddhav/story-yX1mUCGojAa3NPxpr0q6yO.html

She also alleged sanitiser was bought by LMC at higher rates. The municipal commissioner has rubbished the allegations and said , “ All the bottles, which the mayor has referred to in her letter are donated to LMC by a company through its CSR (corporate social responsibility) fund. There has been some misunderstanding.”“LMC has not purchased even a single bottle. Anyone can come and check the papers. The mayor has every right to ask for papers and she should have exercised her right and asked for all the documents regarding the bottles. Now, after this letter, companies would be afraid of donating things to LMC to avoid unnecessary mudslinging,” said Tripathi.“All these bottles were given to sanitation workers and class IV workers performing their duties in hot spots where no one dares to enter. The municipal staff is in the field for 18 to 20 hours a day. Instead of appreciating this fact, such accusations will only lower their morale,” he said.However, mayor Sanyukta Bhatia said, “I have only written for a probe into the matter. The letter was not meant to hurt anyone. The aim is to bring out the truth. If things are not clear, I will keep on asking questions and officials will have to answer them. People have elected me to check misuse of funds and I only need clarity over the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/sanitiser-bottles-overpriced-lucknow-mayor-to-top-lmc-official/story-EHWNjvqESuUzkwRKEoahdM.html

Despite being an orange zone, the district has the highest number of 125 Covid-19 cases in the state. The surge in positive cases has been seen since Monday (May 4). Over 48 people have tested positive in the district in the last five days. At least 21 vegetable sellers at Khandsa Mandi had tested positive for coronavirus so far, and some new cases surfaced from high population density areas. Now, the number of affected areas in Gurugram block has increased to 21 from 13, while there has been no change in the containment zones of Sohna and Pataudi blocks. As per the new list issued by deputy commissioner Amit Khatri on Friday, containment zones in Gurugram are -- Fazilpur Jharsa village, Jharsa village (Sector 39), Sirhaul village (Lane 1, 7, 6B), Tyagiwara, Meghdoot Apartment Sector 10A, Om Nagar, Prem Nagar Sector 12, Dundahera, Ardee City Society (Block A,B,C), Chandan Vihar, Ashok Vihar, Godrej Frontier Society (Tower K), Islampur village, Kadipur Enclave (Lane no. 4), Surat Nagar Phase II (Lane no. 23), Khandsa mandi, Shakti Nagar (Lane no. 2), Anand Garden (Lane no. 3), Krishna Nagar (Lane no. 2), Jyoti Park (Lane numbers 7, 9 and 14) and areas of Sector 12 (near Flying Bird School, Ramlila Ground, Lal Nursing Home and backside of Kharbanda hospital).In Sohna, the containment zones are Gehlot Vihar, Javed Colony, Pahar Colony, Nut Colony, ITI Colony, Raipur village, Shiv Kund, Bhagat Wada and Thakur Wada, while ward numbers 11 and 14 are included in the Pataudi block.

08-05-2020||Gurugram||With Kapashera, Sirhaul out of bounds, labour shortage hits Udyog Vihar||Hit by a shortage of labourers, industries in Udyog Vihar are finding it hard to resume operations even after being given the nod to open their shop floors for production. Industry owners say that many units have been forced to put their plans on resuming production on hold.Owners said that besides many workers choosing to return home, one of the prime reasons behind a shortage of workers at the factory units is that a large number of workers live in Kapashera in Delhi, and are not able to reach Gurguram for work. With the Haryana government not allowing movement across the Gurugram border, except for those engaged in essential services, over 30,000 to 35,000 labourers who work in garment factories, auto ancillaries, and other industries in Udyog Vihar are stuck in Kapashera, said industry owners.Many workers who are Gurugram but live in areas that are under containment zones are also unable to reach factories for work. Movement of around 20,000 to 25,000 workers who live in Sirhaul, a containment zone, has been restricted as well, industrialists said.“Around 500 factories in Udyog Vihar have been allowed to resume operations with 33 percent workforce. But we are not able to start functioning as most of the workers are stuck in Kapashera, Sirhaul, and Dundahera,” Ashok Kohli, president, Chamber of Industries, Udyog Vihar, said.Dundahera village, home to around 15,000 workers, is also a containment zone. “We have permission to start the unit with around 500 workers, but 50 percent of the workers live in Kapashera and they can’t come to Udyog Vihar. It is difficult to set up lodging facilities for them in an industrial unit, so we can do much other than to wait and watch,” said Amarjeet Dagar, vice president, Richa and Company, a garment exporter.Garment exporters in Udyog Vihar also said that unrest was brewing among workers, who are not being allowed to reach industrial areas in Gurugram, as they need to get their salaries, and want to work. “A large number of people had reached the Delhi-Gurugram border, but they were not allowed to enter the district. If such a situation persists then the workers might go back to their hometowns, and there would be more trouble for us,” said Satyendra Singh, general manager, East West Traders, a garment manufacturer and exporter.Many senior executives of Gurugram-based industries who live in Delhi are not able to join work. “We have sent a list of senior officials to the government, and hope weekly passes will be issued to them soon,” said Kohli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/with-kapashera-sirhaul-out-of-bounds-labour-shortage-hits-udyog-vihar/story-AEwOktcOEUVUG26gU1ZHEK.html
08-05-2020||Delhi||Kashmir police IG stirs controversy with comments against CRPF||A comment made by Kashmir inspector general of police Vijay Kumar on the CRPF’s role in counter-terrorism operations has stirred a controversy among the forces deployed in the valley, officials said on Friday.They said IGP Kumar, during a meeting of joint forces at the district police lines in Baramulla on April 29 chaired by DGP Dilbag Singh, reportedly commented that the paramilitary force is a showpiece and the actual operations are conducted by the Army, its elite unit Rashtriya Rifles (RR) with the help of intelligence generated by the state police.Kumar, a 1997-batch Indian Police Service officer, is stated to have said that the work of CRPF in Kashmir operations has not been good and he knows it better as he himself had served in the paramilitary force on deputation earlier.Officials said senior CRPF officers present in the meeting did not take the comments kindly and they later confronted Kumar about his “unpleasant” utterances against their force.Senior state police officials said the issue has created controversy after a section of security forces commanders said the comment was aimed to create a rift among sister forces working against militancy and terrorism in Kashmir Valley.As the issue refused to die down and senior CRPF commanders sought high-level intervention, the Kashmir zone of the J&K Police issued a tweet on Friday specifically praising the role of the country’s largest paramilitary force.“#DGP J&K Shri Dilbagh Singh complimented role of #BSF, #CRPF, @SSB, #ITBP & #CISF deployed on the various assignment in J&K. Specially #CRPF has played a significant role both in maintaining #L&O (law and order) and #CI (counter insurgency) grids,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/kashmir-police-ig-stirs-controversy-with-comments-against-crpf/story-oUwTq5vllmlLnG8yK3UwAP.html

08-05-2020||Gurugram||Khandsa mandi reopens today with restrictions and social distancing in place||The Khandsa mandi, the city’s biggest wholesale vegetable and fruits market, will reopen on Saturday with some changes in its operations to minimise human interaction and reduce the chances of transmitting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), said Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board (HSAMB) officials. The market was shut down on May 5 for four days to sanitise its premises after nine vegetable vendors tested positive for Covid-19.Vinay Yadav, secretary of HSAMB, said on Friday, the mandi will now open for six hours instead of four, between midnight and 6am. Earlier, the mandi used to open from 11pm to 3am. Yadav said that the sale of green vegetables, however, will take place at the open ground of DAV school, located less than 200 metres from the mandi to reduce the concentration of vendors and retailers at one space.“Henceforth, guards will allow the entry of only 100 people per hour into the market. In addition, only 200 street vendors at Khandsa mandi will be allowed to carry out unloading and loading of fruits and vegetables, while only 100 street vendors would be allowed to do the same for green vegetables at the DAV school ground,” said Yadav. Yadav further said that it will be mandatory for any person entering or carrying out operations in the market to wear hand gloves and that barricades would be put up before the counters of green vegetables.“We noticed that vegetable vendors and retailers have the habit of sifting, especially through green vegetables before purchasing. Hence to minimise contact and spread of infection, we have placed barricades five feet before each counter where green vegetables are sold to ensure that human interaction is limited,” said Yadav.HSAMB officials said that they will closely follow the developments on Saturday and accordingly issue remedial measures if needed.They further said that no retailer or vendor below the age of 18 and above the age of 60 will be permitted to enter the market and reiterated the direction that no stock from Azadpur Mandi in Delhi, where coronavirus cases have been reported, will be allowed into the market. The situation will be closely monitored, said officials.The four-day closure of the market had affected the supply of vegetables, especially at roadside vendors and local grocery stores, which procured their stock directly from the market leading to a major shortage and rise in vegetable prices and inferior quality of produce being sold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/khandsa-mandi-reopens-today-with-restrictions-and-social-distancing-in-place/story-IEeGgFhu6bZjOfzYpmHiyN.html
08-05-2020||Gurugram||44,000 households surveyed for relief in Gurugram||Around 44,000 houses have been covered so far in the booth-wise household survey being conducted in the district in 203 panchayats and 35 wards of Gurugram to collect information on impoverished households, people with special needs, and those in need of dry rations and other relief in light of the national lockdown.The survey was started around mid-April. Officials said all households in Gurugram district would be covered in the next 15 days. Nearly 1,000 teams comprising six to seven members each are undertaking the survey across villages and urban areas to gather data to ensure better targeting of the relief measures to people affected by the lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease.“Teams have been tasked to list households in their jurisdictions; impoverished households and those in need of assistance are being identified. Besides, requirements of households, people with ration cards and those without them are also being identified. This information will help us to know who genuinely requires financial assistance, dry rations and other essential items,” said Kulbir Singh Dhaka, chief executive officer, zila parishad, and the nodal officer for the survey.“This data is being compiled by government officials; officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram and social workers have also been roped in to make this initiative successful. The data will be used to target relief towards those who are in need of assistance due to lockdown,” said Dhaka.Across the state, the Haryana government has been distributing rations free of cost for the month of April, May and June to the needy. Financial assistance is also being given to those who need it. A government spokesperson said that 27 lakh families were given wheat, mustard oil, sugar, salt and pulses worth Rs 154 crore in April and this process will continue in May and June. Below-poverty-line and Antyodaya Anna Yojana families have been given rations at a very cheap rate, he said.To facilitate the efforts, the government had formed committees at various levels including sectoral, zonal and district committees. These committees have been tasked to ensure that impoverished and underprivileged households are identified and rations, financial assistance and other facilities made available to them.Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said that relief in terms of cooked food, dry rations and other materials is being given to around 2 lakh people every day since the first week of the lockdown.In Gurugram, the district administration is running 24 relief camps and it has sheltered around 29,000 people, around 60 lakh meals have been provided in collaboration with NGOs and dry ration has been given to people who have registered, a district administration spokesperson said.Madhu Azad, city mayor, who is involved with the initiative, said that the survey also includes social workers who have been roped in make this a collaborative effort. “A lot of information and data has been gathered and work is on to collect more information which will help in better relief outreach,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/44-000-households-surveyed-for-relief-in-gurugram/story-8uo7sGxdBSHlhuqiHS0buN.html

08-05-2020||City||Now, NHAI projects hit due to labour shortage||Gurugram: Amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, several ongoing projects of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) in the city might face a further delay in completion due to unavailability of workers, NHAI contractors said on Friday. Projects such as Ambience Mall underpass, Shankar Chowk elevated U-turn and Badshahpur-Sohna road, which were nearing completion before the lockdown set in, are now likely to miss their deadlines by several months, said the contractors.On April 20, NHAI contractors had applied for permission on the SARAL portal for the movement of workers. On April 24, almost a month after the construction work had stopped due to the lockdown, the district administration gave them permission to resume work. Krishan Kumar, an official of RK Contractor, which has the contract for Ambience Mall underpass and Shankar Chowk elevated U-turn, said, “We had received permission for 20 labourers on both the sites, but now only 10 are left. It’s hard to manage work with half the strength of workers at the sites.”As per Kumar, around 80% of the work on the elevated U-turn at Shankar Chowk is complete, while 70% work on the Ambience Mall underpass has been completed. The Shankar Chowk U-turn was expected to open in April, while the Ambience Mall was expected to open two months later. Kunal Garg, project manager, RK Contractor, said, “With full workforce, the Shankar Chowk U-turn will be completed in one-and-a-half months while it will take another three months for the Ambience Mall underpass project to be thrown open for commuters.”Thousands of migrant workers, who were employed at construction sites and industries in the city, had left the city on foot for their home states in late March after the lockdown to contain the Covid-19 spread was announced. According to government officials, at least 1.9 lakh workers in Gurugram are still waiting to return to their native places and have registered on its online portal for travel assistance.The scenario is the same at Badshahpur-Sohna road project where most of the workers have left the site. This project is divided into two packages. Oriental Structural Engineers Pvt Ltd (OSEPL) is responsible for the first stretch (6 km), while HG Infrastructure is carrying out construction on the second stretch (12.72 km). The first package involves the construction of an underpass at Subhash Chowk and a 5-km elevated section between Subhash Chowk and Badshahpur.Sailesh Kumar, assistant general manager, OSEPL, which is the NHAI contractor, said, “I can’t say anything about the delay, but we had 175 labourers and now only 100 are left.”The second package of the project comprises flyovers and underpasses at important crossings up to Sohna, including a toll plaza at Ghamroj. The total cost of the project is ₹1,313 crore. Kuldeep Rajvanshi, project director, HG Infrastructure, said, “This project was scheduled to be completed by July 2021. But now with workers leaving, it will be delayed. Till now, we completed 55% of the work which also includes constructing the toll plaza building at Ghamroj.”When asked about the matter, NHAI officials in Gurugram said they are aware that the current projects in the city will be delayed due to the shortage of workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/now-nhai-projects-hit-due-to-labour-shortage/story-2LkP1LYK1kDGU7H0zqOm5J.html
08-05-2020||Gurugram||School education department writes to FFRC, asks it to look into the grievances of parents||The principal secretary of the school education department, on Friday, wrote to the chairpersons of the Fee and Fund Regulatory Committee (FFRC) of six districts, including Gurugram, and asked them to address the grievances of parents with respect to the payment of school fees during the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. The secretary said that some private schools were violating the directions of the education department issued in the matter and forcing parents to pay the school fees of their children. In a letter shared with the divisional commissioner-cum-chairman, FFRC, of Gurugram, Faridabad, Ambala, Karnal, Hisar and Rohtak, the secretary wrote that economic activities across various sectors in the state have been disrupted in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis, due to which some parents have been left under acute financial stress. “All business/professional/non-essential activities have ceased to function due to which, some parents, are not in a position to pay the school fee of their wards,” stated the letter. It also mentioned that due to the early closure of schools in view of the lockdown, the expenditure on co-curricular activities, sports activities, transportation and other development-related activities was not incurred. The secretary reiterated that the department had issued orders regarding the payment of fees on April 23, according to which only monthly tuition fee could be sought during the lockdown. The FFRC chairman was asked to ensure that the orders issued by the government are followed and action is taken against private schools if they are found to be violating the directions. The FFRC has also been asked to submit an action-taken report to the department.Last week, the Haryana Progressive School Conference, a consortium of private schools, wrote to the chief minister, demanding that the government clarify as to whether fee exemption has been directed or only deferment of the payment of certain fee components other than tuition fee has been granted for the duration of the lockdown. Haryana Abhibhavak Ekta Manch, a parents’ body, has demanded that the word “deferred” from the April 23 order is removed and that the new orders give them a “waiver” instead. Colonel (retired) KR Pratap Singh, president of the Haryana Progressive School Conference, said that schools were under financial stress since not many parents were coming forward to pay the tuition fees. “Apart from the salaries of teachers, schools need to pay for the transport staff, EMI of buses, and fulfil other financial commitments. Deferment of fees cannot continue for too long,” said Singh. Kailash Sharma, general secretary of Haryana Abhibhavak Ekta Manch, a parents’ body, said that schools would charge exorbitant fees after the lockdown. Therefore, given the financial strain on parents, a fee waiver was needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/school-education-department-writes-to-ffrc-asks-it-to-look-into-the-grievances-of-parents/story-G1dJKSquf6BnRhynzfagDL.html

In response to the court’s notice, Punjab Police will file a reply to the application seeking anticipatory bail on Saturday. A case was registered against Saini and 7 others under Sections 364 (kidnapping or abduction in order to murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 344 (wrongful confinement), 330 (voluntarily causing hurt to exhort confession) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) in Mohali on the complaint of Multani’s brother Palwinder Singh Multani.“Since the Congress came to power, they are continuously harassing me. The Congress government has revengeful attitude,” said the 28-page application in which Saini projected himself as a victim of vendetta, citing registration of cases against current chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on the basis of investigations done by the vigilance bureau when he headed the agency. Referring to Ludhiana City Centre, and Amritsar Improvement Trust cases, Saini said, “I performed my duties without fear or favour and cases involving loss to state exchequer of over ₹1,500 crore, abuse of official positions to give pecuniary advantage to favoured persons and tampering of Vidhan Sabha records, amassing assets disproportionate to known income and routing ill gotten wealth through private companies, shell companies were registered against the then and present CM Captain Amarinder Singh.”Saini said after he reliquished the charge as head of vigilance bureau, cancellation reports were presented in Amritsar Improvement Trust, and Ludhiana City Centre cases, registered in 2007 and 2008, respectively.“When the illegal design of the state government and police miserably failed to falsely implicate me, now they have started digging the earth to bring old cases which have attained finality uptill apex court,” reads the application.The application says that Multani was arrested and presented before a court, while requesting court to stay his arrest. A police team from Mohali was in Delhi on Friday to arrest Saini. Multani, a junior engineer with the Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation, was allegedly picked up by the police after a terrorist attack on Saini in which four cops in his security were killed. The police later claimed Multani escaped from the custody of Qadian police. Saini, was posted as the Chandigarh senior superintendent of police in 1991.Counsel withdrawsHours after moving application for Saini’s anticipatory bail, his counsel Satnam Singh Kaler withdrew from the case. “I am a Sikh and for me religion is more important.

After being confined to their homes for more than a month due to lockdown imposed to check the spread of Covid-19, many residents said they turned the keys to power up the engines of their cars this week, only to find their batteries dead.While some residents were left to figure out a solution on their own, for several others, their RWAs came to the rescue arranging for vehicle mechanics who could jump-start cars.Aashish Sharma, a resident of Tulip Orange in sector 70 said that after restrictions were eased on May 4, many residents, like him, stepped into their vehicles to visit markets, they discovered that the car wouldn’t start. “Medical stores, milk booth, ATMs, vegetable shops are all located in close vicinity of our society. So residents had little reason to use their vehicles and travel to far-off places during the lockdown. Once people started realising that the problem of starting their vehicles was affecting many, the RWA on Wednesday circulated a message on the society Whatsapp group asking residents to check if their vehicles were functioning or else they could make arrangements for a mechanic who could help jump-start their cars,” said Sharma.As part of the arrangement, on Friday, about 75 vehicles at Tulip Orange were given a jump-start by the staff of an automotive battery manufacturer.Pradeep Kumar, branch manager of Amaron Automobiles in Haryana, said that the problem was not unique to Tulip Orange. On May 5, when his company resumed operations, they received more than 450 calls for jump-starting vehicles across the city.“We anticipated such a situation could occur as people would have little reason to start their vehicles or move around during the lockdown period, due to which car batteries would die. On April 29, through various media platforms, we started circulating messages to inform residents that, in case their cars are not starting, they can avail our services whenever the lockdown is eased,” said Kumar.The problem of was so widespread and chronic that the RWAs of some gated societies themselves made arrangements to come to the aid of their residents. RWAs of residential societies — such as Mapsko Casabella in sector 82 and Sare Homes in sector 92— themselves procured jump-start machines to get the cars going.Praveen Malik, president of Sare Homes residents’ welfare association (RWA), Sector 92, said that the RWA had anticipated car-battery related issues to occur during the lockdown period and had made prior arrangements to procure a jumpstart machine.“We had anticipated that due to the lockdown, the condition of car batteries will be affected and late last month purchased a jump-starter as a precautionary measure. At the same time, we also told residents to start their vehicles frequently to ensure that their cars remain in a good state. Till now, around 10 cases of batteries being dead have been reported and the RWA has subsequently helped them out.” he said.Dharamveer Singh, the president of Mapsko Casabella, Sector 82, RWA, said that the RWA has placed an order for a jump-starter and are expecting delivery by the weekend.“We have received many complaints from residents about their cars not starting. Residents might need their vehicles in case of an emergencies. So, we have placed an order for a jump-starter that will be kept at the society gate and can be used by anyone who needs it,” He said.Besides the jump-start service, even battery dealers are in high demand in the city.Sumit Bhalla, owner of Bhalla Batteries in Sikanderpur, said in the last three days he has received over 40 calls from residents across the city looking for battery replacement. “People usually prefer to jump-start their vehicles and continue to use their existing batteries until it completely gives way. However, I have been receiving at least 10-15 calls since May 4 from residents looking to replace their batteries altogether,” said Bhalla, adding that he has only been able to attend to around 20 such requests from residents, as most of his staff are stuck in their respective hometowns.The cost for buying a new battery can range between Rs 2500-9,000 depending on its quality. For jump-start, a mechanic can tacharge anything between Rs 500-1200. Deepak Kumar, a local mechanic and battery supplier on Sohna Road, said that in the four days since reopening his shop, he has sold and fitted batteries at residential areas in sectors 33, 38, 47, and 48. “A majority of my customers were those whose car batteries had died late last month and were waiting for restrictions to be eased so that they could get it changed. I received more than 20 calls on Monday morning from residents for my services, and have spent three days attending to them. I still have around 10 more pending requests,” said Kumar. BOX: How to keep car batteries in good condition during lockdown*Start your car at least twice a week and keep it running for more than 15 minutes each time*Drive your vehicle at least 500 metres on each occasion*If safe, discharge your GPS trackers and car alarms as they consume a lot of battery* Ensure your interior lights, music system, and headlights are turned off when you leave the car*If your vehicle is not starting in two or three attempts, stop right away to make sure the battery has enough power left to jumpstart later or else you may have to replace your battery altogether||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/lockdown-eased-ggm-rwas-arrange-mechanics-to-jump-start-stalled-cars/story-cGGmTodCnvrwNLigntu41H.html

08-05-2020||City||Delhi paid complete ticket fare for 1,200 migrants going to Bihar: Gopal Rai||New Delhi: Delhi labour minister Gopal Rai on Friday said the city government paid for the tickets of around 1,200 migrants who left for Bihar in a special train earlier in the day.Under the central government’s guidelines, either the destination or the origin state of the concerned train has to bear 15% of the ticket cost – the remaining 85% is taken care of by the Centre. The tickets are to be charged by the railways at sleeper class rates, and an additional ₹50.The first such special train had left Delhi on Thursday evening for Chhatarpur in Madhya Pradesh. In that event, 15% of the ticket price was paid by Madhya Pradesh. “The Delhi government is working around the clock to ensure safe travel for all the stranded workers. The government has made lists of these stranded people and already shared with their home states. There are many states who have not yet responded on the matter of bearing costs. Therefore, the Delhi government has decided that if the home states do not respond the Delhi government will bear the travel cost of these stranded workers,” said a statement issued by Rai’s office.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Monday had clarified that students returning to the state by special trains won’t have to pay rail fare, while migrant workers will get an additional ₹500 over and above the reimbursement of the expense incurred on the travel, on completion of the mandatory 21-day quarantine period. The CM, in the midst of a raging debate over the footing of train fare that was kicked off by Opposition RJD and Congress and also brought the ruling alliance partners BJP and JD (U) face-to-face, the Kumar in a video message said that it was imperative on his part to dispel doubts and confusion about the government stand on the issue. “There is no need to worry, neither the students nor the migrant workers will pay for their return to home.”“Once these migrant workers or eligible people, arriving from outside the state, complete their 21-day isolation at designated quarantine centres, the expenses incurred for boarding special trains will be reimbursed. Thus, each worker will be getting a minimum of ₹1,000,” the CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-paid-complete-ticket-fare-for-1-200-migrants-going-to-bihar-gopal-rai/story-0slDX1fqHicwlPI94iQeIJ.html
08-05-2020||Chandigarh||Five-star quarantine on offer at Hotel Mountview in Chandigarh||The Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Development Corporation (CITCO) will offer five-star quarantine facilities to NRIs returning to Chandigarh at Hotel Mountview in Sector 10. This comes as the UT administration has coordinated with the Central government for return of around 5,000 NRIs to Chandigarh. An order put out by the administration on Friday mentioned that priority will be given to Hotel Mountview for their quarantine.The proposed hotel packages include four room categories — business, superior, deluxe executive and royal suite — on a single/dual sharing basis (see box). The hotel will work with minimum staff and social distancing measures. Each guest will be provided with a complimentary hand sanitiser, gloves, and face masks as per the length of the stay.Each package will come with a complimentary breakfast, and 33% discount will be offered on lunch and dinner as per hotel industry norms. All meals will be served in the room with disposable plates and spoons.RECOVERING LOSSESSources in the CITCO said that the move comes as the corporation looks to recover the losses due to the lockdown.Calling it a great marketing strategy, Ankit Gupta, president of the City Chandigarh Hospitality Association, said CITCO should follow proper safety measures while quarantining the NRI guests.CITCO union president Kashmir Chand added, “The move will help in generating some revenue, but the facility should be provided keeping the health of corporation employees in mind.”Presently, CITCO is accommodating health workers in Hotel Parkview in Sector 24 for quarantine and rest as a complimentary gesture by the Chandigarh administration.Recently, CITCO had sought around ₹33 crore from the UT administration to pay the salaries of staff and other utility bills.With yearly turnover of around ₹500 crore, CITCO owns and operates some prime properties in Chandigarh including five-star hotels, restaurants bars, sales depots, lakes, gardens and a petrol pump.

08-05-2020||Lucknow||Munna Bajrangi murder case: CBI may bring key accused Sunil Rathi to Sitapur jail from Tihar||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Lucknow unit is likely to bring dreaded gangster Sunil Rathi to Sitapur district jail from Tihar, to interrogate him in connection with the murder of another gangster Prem Prakash Singh alias Munna Bajrangi. Rathi is key accused in the murder of Bajrangi, who was shot dead inside Baghpat jail on July 9, 2018.A senior CBI official revealed that the CBI had written a letter to the authorities concerned to shift him to Sitapur district jail, which is closer to Lucknow, so that he could be interrogated thoroughly and cross-questioned if required. He said the shifting of Rathi was required as Bajrangi’s family was in Lucknow and it would be tough for the investigating team to record statements of both (Rathi as well as Bajrangi’s family members) and cross-question him accordingly.“We need to cross-question Rathi many times to know the truth behind Bajrangi’s murder inside the jail,” He said.He said Rathi earlier was shifted to Fatehpur jail from Baghpat jail after his involvement surfaced in Bajrangi’s murder. He said the CBI team had also sought details of people who met him in Fatehpur jail and was cross-checking their links to him. The CBI team had earlier questioned the officials and personnel of Jhansi and Baghpat district jails for two consecutive days on March 17 and 18 in connection with the murder. Sources privy to the investigation said the CBI officials suspected the involvement of some personnel of Jhansi district jail where Bajrangi was lodged for over three years before being shifted to Baghpat district jail on the night of July 8, 2018. He was murdered within a few hours after being shifted and photographs of his bullet-riddled body had gone viral early morning on July 9, 2018.The CBI had registered an FIR in the matter on March 7, 2018, in compliance with the Allahabad high court order dated February 25, 2018 on a petition filed by Bajrangi’s wife Seema Singh. The petitioner’s contention was that there might be involvement of some mafia in the murder. The petitioner had demanded that the role of jail officials was doubtful and therefore, the investigation must be transferred to the CBI.Bajrangi, a gangster from eastern Uttar Pradesh, was lodged in jail since 2009 in connection for the murder of BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai in Mohamadabad in Ghazipur district on November 29, 2005, and another BJP leader Ramchandra Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/munna-bajrangi-murder-case-cbi-may-bring-key-accused-sunil-rathi-to-sitapur-jail-from-tihar/story-wAUEdwfhUsFuNQpIo3rFGP.html
08-05-2020||Chandigarh||5,000 NRIs from Chandigarh to return home||The UT administration has coordinated with the central government for the return of around 5,000 non-resident Indians (NRI) to Chandigarh.The administration has also contacted Delhi and Haryana governments to ensure that the returnees are put under 14-day quarantine.The central government had put restrictions on foreign travellers in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. In March too, around 2,200 NRIs and city residents travelling abroad had returned to the city. Notably the first positive case in the city was that of a foreign-returnees.UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said, “As per our request, the Delhi and Haryana governments have agreed to keep them in hotels in Delhi and Gurugram.”When asked whether the administration had any arrangements in place if an NRI does not want to avail the facilities by the Delhi and Haryana governments, and prefers to return to Chandigarh, Parida replied in the negative. “The returnee cannot chose his place of quarantine. All returnees will have to stay in the quarantine facilities provided to them in Delhi and Gurugram,” said Parida.He said the NRIs belonging to Chandigarh, who land in airports like Amritsar or Mohali directly from abroad, will be quarantined in Chandigarh hotels on payment ranging tentatively from ₹3,000 to ₹6,000 per day. Arrangements for the same have been made at the public sector hotels — Mountview in Sector 10 and Shivalikview in Sector 17. A final call on the issue will be taken by the UT administrator VPS Badnore on Saturday.The administration is also trying to rope in private sector hotels to provide quarantine/accommodation facility to NRIs from Chandigarh landing in Mohali or Amritsar.Arun Kumar Gupta, principal secretary, home, said he will hold a meeting with private sector hotels on Saturday in this regard.” The hotels will have the option to provide accommodation as per the central government guidelines.Parida, said, “We will mostly be getting students, or those whose visa has expired, or those who want to meet their old parents here. How many actually come depends on the number of flights allowed by foreign countries. The 14-day quarantine may dissuade them. Indian embassies abroad are coordinating.”UT deputy inspector general (DIG) Shashank Anand has been designated as the nodal officer to coordinate with airport authorities and hotels for travel and quarantine of the NRIs.UT administrator VPS Badnore directed that necessary care be taken for screening the foreign returnees, with complete health check during their stay in Chandigarh hotels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/5-000-nris-from-chandigarh-to-return-home/story-ErI9VqDEbMtmt4Kj5hdMpK.html

She was Chief of Residents at Union Hospital, now part of RWJ Barnabas Health.“Dr. Satyender Dev Khanna and Dr. Priya Khanna were father and daughter. They both dedicated their lives to helping others. This is a family dedicated to health and medicine. Our words cannot amply express our condolences,” New Jersey Governor Murphy tweeted on Thursday. “Both dedicated their lives to helping others and we lost both of them to Covid-19,” Murphy said during a press conference on Thursday, saying their demise is a “particularly tough one.” Satyender passed away at the Clara Maass Medical Center where he had worked for more than 35 years.Murphy described him as a “pioneering doctor” who was one of the first surgeons to perform laparoscopic surgery in the state. He is being remembered by colleagues as a “gentle and caring physician.” “And for a doctor, I’m not one, but I would bet, I don’t think there could be a more fitting way to be remembered, or a nurse or a healthcare worker of any kind,” Murphy said, adding that the doctor had a passion for bicycling, and he often found peace from the hustle of the hospital in biking along the Jersey Shore.Priya did all of her medical training in New Jersey and then did her fellowship in nephrology in South Jersey with the Cooper Health System.Like her father, she too worked at Clara Maass, where she died.She was also Medical Director at two dialysis centers in Essex County and “took pride” in teaching the next generation of doctors, Murphy said, adding that the ICU physician who cared for Priya Khanna was trained and taught by her as well.“Priya will be remembered as a caring and selfless person who put others first. And even while in the hospital, fighting her own battle, she continued to check up on her mom and dad and her family,” Murphy said.“This is a family, by the way, dedicated to health and medicine,” he said.The governor spoke with Satyender’s wife Komlish Khanna, who is a pediatrician. The couple has two more daughters - Sugandha Khanna, an emergency medicine physician and Anisha Khanna, a pediatrician.“Unbelievable. Our words cannot amply express our condolences nor, I am sure, can they express the pain that the Khanna family is feeling. But I hope that the fact that our entire state mourns with them is some small comfort. And we mourn everyone we have lost. We commit in their memory to saving as many lives as we can,” Murphy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-origin-father-daughter-doc-duo-die-of-covid-19-in-us/story-OiNZaFnG8UTP9pHGbo66xN.html

08-05-2020||City||Bihar: Polls looming, parties scramble to woo returning migrants||PATNAThe homecoming of thousands of migrant workers since the Covid-19 lockdown began on March 24 and realisation that they may not be in a hurry this time to return to big cities outside the state for work has woken up political parties in poll-bound Bihar to the need of wooing them aggressively.After initial reluctance to facilitate the return of these migrants citing fear of spread of the pandemic, the NDA government led by Nitish Kumar is now scrambling to find ways for their employment back home. More than 82,544 people, majority of them migrant labourers, have returned to Bihar during the lockdown 3, after central government started running special trains for ferry people stuck at different places and willing to go back home. Before that, as per government records, 1.80 lakh had come after lockdown was announced for the first time.“The CM has made it clear that this is the time to convert challenges into opportunities. The idea of skill mapping of returning migrants is to ensure better utilization of their services,” said JD (U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan, who attended a meeting of office-bearers of his party that was chaired the chief minister on Thursday. Ranjan conceded that these workers would play a crucial role in elections.“Those who had returned or are returning are here to stay. They are not returning to their workplace for at least two years as they do not want to go back,” said BJP MLC and former union minister Sanjay Paswan. The BJP leader, who is on lien professor of labour and social welfare at Patna University, feels their return is good for the ruling alliance. “A majority of them, about 75%, are from extremely backward castes, 20% are SCs/STs and barely 5% are from upper caste. The caste profile of the migrants suits us, even though they are a bit against us as on today due to vacillation of the state government over their return,” Paswan says. “All we need to do is to accommodate them, think about their re-employment so that there is no social unrest.” Opposition Congress was quick to claim credit for the return of migrants. “From the very beginning. Congress has been demanding that the central and state governments facilitate return journey of migrant labourers to Bihar and to their respective states. But neither paid any heed,” state Congress president Madan Mohan Jha said.Experts believe a meaningful utilisation of migrants’ skills can bring benefits. “They are skilled to perform in primary as well as service sectors. If the government meaningfully links them with the help of financial institutions, they will make Bihar shine,” says D M Diwakar, formery with AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies.Shefali Roy, head of department (political science) at Patna University, says, “Elitist democracy thrives on votes of the poor and wealth of the rich. Initially, the Bihar government was reluctant in giving any respite to them. It suddenly became active realising potential of labourers as voters. The announcement of government to give Rs 1500 (500+1000) to each of them after 21 days of quarantine period is a strategy to woo the future voters. Memory is short so the troubles will soon be forgotten by labourers and cash will definitely soften their opinion towards government.” BJP’s state president Sanjay Jaiswal is of the opinion that the returning migrants would be a big asset in turning around fortunes of the state. “They have been instrumental in development of Maharashtra, Punjab, Delhi, Gujarat and several states. We welcome them. They are good omen for us,” said state BJP spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bihar-polls-looming-parties-scramble-to-woo-returning-migrants/story-auG8gKDf8qEOwlRqrQzNMP.html
08-05-2020||City||Migrants ‘homing’ in, Bihar plans 12.32 lakh new houses for rural poor to create jobs||PATNAAmid massive reverse migration of workers, the Bihar government, in a bid to generate more employment for the rural poor, has begun the process of sanctioning 12.32 lakh new housing units under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana( PMAY-Grameen) and set completion deadlines for them by end of 2020-21.The ambitious target has been set in an effort to engage as many job card holders under MGNREGS ( Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Guaranntee Scheme) and also give a boost to rural economy post-lockdown as construction activity is major source of livelihood for rural poor.At present, Bihar has 32 lakh families from the economically weaker section (EWS) eligible for housing units under permanent waiting list (PWL), of which 20 lakh have been sanctioned houses from 2015-16 to 2019-20 under the centrally sponsored scheme.“We expect to generate huge employment opportunities for job card holders under MGNREGA by speeding up construction work on housing units under PMAY-G. We have already started work in several districts and respective district magistrates (DMs) are monitoring it closely by ensuring safety guidelines,” said principal secretary, rural development department (RDD), Arvind Kumar Chaudhary.“This year, we have set a target of creating 18 crore mandays under MGNREGA in rural areas due to inflow of migrants,” he said.RDD officials said emphasis is on completing PMAY units as it is safe option in present circumstances when social distancing norms have to be followed at work sites. “Each dwelling unit, spread over 25 square metres, requires three to four labourers, which is quite a safe option of employment keeping social distancing in mind,” said an RDD official.As per official data, around 1.80 lakh migrants have returned from other states since the lockdown began 43 days ago. A few lakh more are expected to return in next one month.The RDD has asked all DMs to update the list of pending houses of those living outside the state so that EWS families or their heads, having returned home, could complete the work on priority. As per latest data, there are 28,672 units where work is pending because the family or its head resides outside the state. “Our focus now is to encourage all those beneficiaries coming home to finish construction of their houses in the next few months,” said Rajesh Parimal, deputy secretary, RDD.However, the task of completing 12.32 lakh housing units in rural Bihar in next one year looks a tall order, with many challenges like non-availability of land, lack of skilled labour force and shortage of construction material due to disrupted supply chain of sand, stone chips and cement post-lockdown. Data suggests the completion rate of old sanctioned housing units has not been very high in the last few years.To date, 9.50 lakh housing units, against the target of 20 lakh units, are nearing completion or have been completed whereas work is pending or in progress in 11 lakh units. Non-timely allocation of funds to beneficiaries is another obstacle, sources said. RDD officials though claim the progress has been fast and 2.90 lakh new units were allotted by the Centre last year because of better completion rate of housing units.“We will be asking beneficiaries to complete works within next three months after sanction as labour force is not going to be problem this year. The target is well achievable,” said a senior RDD official. Beneficiaries are selected as per the socio-economic caste census in 2011 to provide houses to homeless and those living in decrepit houses to assist them in constructing pucca houses. An assistance of 1.50 lakh is provided to beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrants-homing-in-bihar-plans-12-32-lakh-new-houses-for-rural-poor-to-create-jobs/story-obDVcdDXAMYxbJNqcjaTtL.html

There were some from other countries as well, he added.He said that the MEA was yet to intimate the dates about when the flights carrying stranded Indians to Bihar will operate.”These passengers will arrive at the Gaya international airport. We have made arrangements for their quarantine at hotels in Gaya itself,” Kumar said.“After scrutiny, they will be quarantined for 14 days, either in a hospital or in an institutional quarantine on payment-basis, by the concerned state government,” a statement by the MEA had said on Monday.After the quarantine, they will be tested again for coronavirus before being allowed to go home.The 2,075 people for Bihar are among the 200,000 stranded Indians desirous to return to their respective home states.

It is not as simple as it looks. There could be some hidden agenda behind it. How do these unscrupulous elements inform prospective passengers about such buses operating around midnight? Our government will certainly take cognizance of such things and take it up at the appropriate level,” he said.Earlier also, there had been reports of private bus services charging three times the normal fare from already harassed migrants in other states. Many passengers had complained about it when they were dropped at Bihar borders a couple of weeks ago from different places.Meanwhile, stranded migrant workers also complained about of lack of information. Vikas Ram, Md Qudus Ansari and around 20 others are desperate to head home in Bihar and Jharkhand from Aurangabad in Maharasthra, but don’t know how. They are making frantic calls to whatever number they get in the hope of help.“We worked at a welding work in a factory here, but everything is closed now. There is no point staying here, as we cannot sustain,” Ansari, not sure how he would reach Banka district in Bihar, said on phone.“We got ourselves medically examined and we have certificates. We went to the local police station, but they said we should get registered online. We don’t know how to do it online. There is nobody helping us,” he said.Ram form Jharkhand said they would take a bus about which someone informed them. “Regarding train, we are not aware. Which bus service we would take, we still don’t know.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/free-bus-service-offers-take-migrants-for-a-ride-bihar-minister-vows-action/story-2IAyoREdkg8VYuz36QhGAL.html

Nobody has stopped people from coming from Karnataka. In fact, two trains, one on May 3 and other on May 6, have already arrived here. State government has also given consent to run eight more trains. Opposition is unnecessary propagating such rumours,” said Bihar’s deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi.Disaster management department’s principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit said that as per the protocol laid down by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the originating states send a request for no-objection certificate (NOC) to destination state. “States making request are given in-principle permission and are asked to send a passengers’ list. With regard to Karnataka, two trains had already arrived while eight others are lined up between May 8 and May 15,” said Amrit. “If the trains did not run, it might be due to their own problems,” he said.The principal secretary said that state had issued NOC to run 121 trains, including those from the states like Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Delhi, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat.“What we have definitely done is to have asked each state to send us passengers’ list as it helps in proper routing, selection of stations, earmarking buses, quarantine centres etc. We have also ensured that 15-18 trains reach different destinations per day,” said the principal secretary. “This is one of the biggest evacuation drive taken by the state,” he said.Secretary IPRD Anupam Kumar said that between May 1 and 8, 70 trains have been operated and a total of 82,544 migrants and students have reached different places in state. Kumar said that on Saturday (May 9), 15 more trains would be reaching state with 18,115 people. The secretary said that with regard to reverse migration, the respective district magistrates have been authorized to issue e-passes of vehicles to all those who want to return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bihar-70-trains-in-so-far-51-more-coming/story-aCIe7m3sLp4L6kDlMz9hUJ.html

Some of these people live in Delhi and work in Noida, while others live in Noida and work in Delhi. However, the Noida traffic police are strictly enforcing lockdown norms and allowing only people with passes through.Shambhu Kumar, a resident of Okhla Tank in Delhi, was stopped at the DND Flyway. “I work for a private cable firm and I travel around Delhi and Noida for work. I received a call to fix a cable connection in Sector 12-22. I reached the Delhi-Noida border but the police personnel are not allowing me to enter Noida,” he said.Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police, Noida (traffic) said that the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has not relaxed the restrictions for interstate commuting. “The administration has recently issued detailed guidelines on the relaxation of some services. The factories and companies have been given passes to ferry employees on their buses. Employers are also expected to engage only those workers who live in Noida and Greater Noida,” he said.The Noida Entrepreneurs’ Association (NEA) said that the district administrations of Noida, Delhi and Ghaziabad need to make a coordinated effort and ease the commuting of employees and employers at interstate borders. “A number of the workforce and employers live in Ghaziabad and Delhi and work in Noida. There is no clarity on how they are to commute. In addition to this, factories will face problems in terms of supplies for production. It is not necessary that all of Noida’s production will be consumed in Noida. We need relaxation in norms to supply goods across the NCR and other parts of the country. We will also face problems in getting raw materials from different cities,” Sudhir Shrivastava, vice present, NEA, said. The NEA has over 1,800 members who are involved in manufacturing products in the electric, electronic, mechanical, cable as well as other fields. Shrivastava said that the factories and companies have started reopening and sanitising their premises, and are expecting most employees back from Monday.The district administration has so far permitted 210 buses of these private companies and factories to ferry employees. People engaged in essential services, including medical practitioners, media persons, etc. are allowed entry after producing passes issued to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/traffic-jam-at-dnd-flyway-as-workers-flock-to-noida-delhi-border/story-6BIkFnAYxOYIUoILVNyd6H.html

If any parent has deposited the increased fees, then it would be adjusted in subsequent months. As per the government order, dated April 7, 2020, all the schools have been directed not to demand quarterly fees. Instead of quarterly fees, schools will take fees on monthly basis,” the guidelines stated.GB Nagar district inspector of schools (DIOS), Neeraj Kumar Pandey said that all the schools have been directed not to force any student to deposit their fees and further said that no students will be disenrolled because of their inability to pay the fees.“If the schools violate these orders, complaints can be made to the district fee regulation committee (DFRC). The case will be heard under the provisions of UP Self-Financed Independent Schools (fee regulations) Act, 2018,” he said.Pandey further said that after making enquiry as per Section 8(4)(b) of the Act and hearing the school authorities for the non compliance of the order, the DFRC may impose a financial punishment of up to ₹1lakh, along with an order to refund the excess fee levied on the student for the first-time violation of the law. In case of violating the order twice, the fine will be of ₹5lakh, while for the third violation, the DFRC may even recommend for the withdrawal of the recognition or the affiliation of the school to the board concerned,” he said.Meanwhile, criticising the district administration’s guidelines for not waiving off the monthly fees, Noida estate flat owners’ main association (NEFOMA) said that the recent guidelines have not taken account of parents’ woes. NEFOMA general secretary Rashmi Pandey said despite repeated demands of waiving off the monthly fees being made by the parents, the district administration couldn’t give them any respite. “Many of the parents have lost their jobs or their businesses have been stalled. How can they pay the fees of their children? They have been demanding that fees imposed for the lockdown period should be either waived off or at least reduced to 25% like other states. However, the government has failed to give them any relief,” she said.Pandey further said that despite facing problems with network and systems, the parents are being compelled to pay around ₹10,000 as tuition fees for online classes. “We’ll remain requesting the chief minister to take cognisance of the distress faced by the parents of GB Nagar district and give them proper relief at this time of crisis,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-administration-issues-guidelines-for-school-fee/story-c8p0UGPCKdAsMQXegBkSkJ.html

08-05-2020||Noida||Seven arrested for running a fake call centre||Seven persons were arrested by the Sector 39 police on Thursday night for allegedly running a fake call centre in Sector 105 and duping Americans on the pretext of helping them with security issues.The police received a tip that a fake call centre was being run from a house in Sector 105. Based on that information, they informed an assistant manager with MTNL and raided the premises.“All of them were nabbed from the spot. They had rented the house and were staying together. Even though they said that the operation had been going on for only three months, we suspect that it is much older,” Shailesh Tomar, station house officer, Sector 39 police station, said.The police said that the suspects would obtain the victims’ contact information through online portals and would use VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) technology to make calls over the Internet. They would tell the victims that their social security numbers had been used in crimes like drugs trafficking, money laundering or vehicle thefts. The suspects would pretend to be from law enforcement agencies and ask their victims to pay a fine and also take their account or card information.“We are still trying to determine how many people they duped and how much money they earned this way. Five persons associated with the operation are still on the run. The suspects told us that the mastermind is one of the missing persons and we are investigating all aspects,” the SHO said.He said that the arrested men are in their early twenties, graduates and speak English well. Six of them are from Mumbai while one is from Gujarat.The suspects were booked under sections 420 (cheating), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the IT Act and Indian Telegraph Act, 1855.The police recovered 25 desktops, 23 CPUs, keyboards, mouse, headphones, WiFi routers, cables, Aadhaar cards, passports, passbooks, motorcycles and an employee identity card of a bank in Kuwait.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/seven-arrested-for-running-a-fake-call-centre/story-Mr0q4o4KEFhc4gQRVoSCkP.html

08-05-2020||Noida||Two held for transporting migrants during lockdown, 5,182 arrested until now||The Phase 2 police arrested two men early Friday morning for allegedly transporting migrants to Bihar. The Gautam Budh Nagar police has so far arrested 5,182 people for the offence since the beginning of the lockdown.The suspects were identified as Wakil Khan and Rashid, residents of Ghaziabad and Meerut, respectively. According to the police, they were driving two buses with banners stating ‘By Bihar government, free service for migrants of Delhi, UP, Gautam Budh Nagar’.“We found the buses around 1.30am at the Bhangel-Dadri-Surajpur Road with people on and around them. Upon questioning, we found that the suspects were charging ₹3,000 to take these people to Bihar. When we asked for permission documents, a third person showed us an e-pass issued by the Siwan district magistrate. We asked him for a physical copy, to which he said that it was on the bus and fled, leaving his phone behind. The drivers identified him as the owner of the buses,” Farmood Ali Pundir, station house officer, Phase 2 police station, said.The police said that upon verification, they found that the Siwan DM had issued no such pass, after which they booked the suspects under sections 420, 468, 188, 269, 270 and 271 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Both the buses were also seized.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called for a three-week nationwide lockdown from March 25, which was later extended till May 3 and then further until May 17. However, the Uttar Pradesh government had already announced the imposition of a three-day lockdown from March 23, which was subsequently merged with the nationwide lockdown. Ever since then, the district police has registered 1,430 cases for violations of the lockdown and booked 5,974 people and arrested more than 112 per day on an average, according to data obtained till 7pm on May 7.The police department is carrying out daily checks at 200 barricaded posts in the district, including border areas, and has checked 92,548 vehicles during the lockdown period so far. Of these, they have fined the owners of 21,245 vehicles for various violations and seized 1,102 vehicles. The department has also collected almost ₹2.35 lakh in fines.A police spokesperson said that the police have also registered five cases under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, in which they booked five people and arrested three.During the lockdown, the police have permitted 3,521 essential service vehicles to move in and out of the district. However, the district borders continue to remain sealed for other vehicles.Meanwhile, the commissionerate is also prepared to take stringent action against any person found misbehaving with corona warriors.“Under the new law (UP public health and epidemic disease control ordinance 2020 which protects doctors, paramedical staff, sanitary workers, police personnel) an offender might be imprisoned for a period of six months up to seven years and fined between ₹50,000- ₹5 lakh depending on the severity of the action,” commissioner of police Alok Singh said.Violating the quarantine, running away from hospitals, obscene or indecent conduct towards corona warriors, spitting or throwing garbage on them or not disclosing the disease or knowingly travelling by public transport while being infected are all punishable by law and can lead to heavy penalty and prison time, Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/two-held-for-transporting-migrants-during-lockdown-5-182-arrested-until-now/story-INcnlkBY2dAzHCnxJtpNOM.html
08-05-2020||Noida||Retail sale at Sector 88 mandi banned; administration to regulate traders’ entry||The Gautam Budh Nagar administration has decided to stop the retail sale of fruits and vegetables at Noida’s Sector 88 mandi following large gatherings at the wholesale market on Thursday and Friday.Social distancing norms at the market had gone for a toss at Navin Mandi, Sector 88 the past two days as many vegetable vendors and local residents thronged the wholesale market to buy vegetables and fruits.The district administration said it will only allow wholesale trade at the market from now and will also regulate the entry of visitors. “Barricades have been put up at all the three major roads leading to the market. We will start issuing passes to vendors and traders, and only those with passes will be allowed to enter the mandi. The pass will mention the dates and time slots when a vendor can visit and engage in trade at the mandi,” Santosh Kumar Yadav, secretary, Noida Mandi Board, said. “Every day only 100 rickshaws will be allowed to enter the market.”“Only wholesale trade is allowed at the mandi now. Farmers and vegetable traders will also have to pass through sanitisation tunnel at gate number 1. Shop owners have also been directed to get themselves and their staff tested for coronavirus. Shop licenses will be canceled for violating the guidelines,” Yadav added.The administration also appealed to the vegetable vendors and traders to wear masks at all times and adhere to physical distancing norms. Noida city Magistrate Umesh Kumar said, “We are taking a practical approach to ensure that the supply of vegetables to residents is not affected while making sure that physical distance norms are followed properly at the market. We appeal to shop owners and buyers to wear masks and maintain physical distance.”Vegetable traders said that maintaining adequate physical distance at the wholesale market is important and they support the district administration’s decision to regulate entry. “We will help the mandi board in maintaining physical distancing as far as possible. We have also suggested to the board that entry inside the mandi should be allowed for two hours and the gates should only open after three hours. Entry should be allowed between 10pm and midnight after which the entry gates should be shut. Entry gates should be opened again at 3am, and we will ensure that visitors already inside leave the mandi. This will help in maintaining social distance,” Mange Ram Sharma, president, Navin Mandi welfare association. “Over 6,000 buyers and sellers visit the mandi every day, besides some 1,000 people who work at the shops here ”“The mandi board has been trying to ensure that safety measures are implemented properly at the market. They have also installed a sanitisation tunnel outside the mandi. The problem is that a large number of vendors and residents are coming inside to buy vegetables, and managing the crowd is very difficult. The mandi board has planned to regulate the entry which should help in maintaining physical distance,” Raj Singh, secretary of the association said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/retail-sale-at-sector-88-mandi-banned-administration-to-regulate-traders-entry/story-AdaRvhNfrOfoCYIOs10EtL.html

He was the first resident of Gautam Buddh Nagar district to succumb to the disease after testing positive for it.A resident of Sector 22, Noida, the man was admitted to Metro Hospital in Sector 11 on May 4 for the treatment of certain comorbidities and tested positive for Covid-19 on late Thursday evening.The man was then transferred to GIMS. “The patient was brought to us by 3.30am on Friday and he died at 3.45am due to respiratory failure as he was suffering from pneumonia because of the Covid-19 infection,” said GIMS director Dr Rakesh Gupta. Authorities at the Metro Hospital said all information about the man has been provided to the chief medical officer(CMO) of Gautam Buddh Nagar and only the health department is allowed speak on the matter. The patient’s Covid-19 report was awaited till Thursday evening while he was being treated at Metro Hospital for respiratory distress.Health officials from the district health department said the man was moved to GIMS after his condition deteriorated. His report of Covid-19 infection came a few hours before his death. “The deceased was undergoing treatment for pulmonary disease at the Metro Hospital. The Metro Hospital’s officials decided to shift the patient to GIMS after his condition continued to deteriorate despite being put on a ventilator,” said a senior health official.The health department has informed that the person was suffering from respiratory problems but the Metro Hospital continued treating him and didn’t inform the health department until his reports confirmed him being positive for the infection on Thursday evening. It took a few hours to complete the formalities before the patient was shifted to GIMS. Authorities at GIMS handed over the body of the deceased to two of his family members after properly sanitising it and putting it in a treated body bag. Police, health officials and the two family members carried the body in an ambulance provided by GIMS to the electronic crematorium in Sector 94 of Noida.“The body was taken to the electronic crematorium as it is the safest way to dispose of Covid-19 dead bodies. We followed all the protocols like removing the cannula, covering nostrils and sanitising the body and the body bags properly before handing it over to family members. The last rites were performed in the presence of police and health officials. No postmortem examination was performed on the body. Nobody was allowed to touch the body without following the protocol,” said Dr Gupta.

08-05-2020||City||After outrage, Ghaziabad high-rise withdraws notice to stop entry of doctors, health workers||The owners’ association of a high-rise in Vaishali withdrew a notice asking doctors and health care workers living in the complex to stay put in Delhi until the end of the Covid-19 lockdown after the move drew widespread criticism on social media. The district administration, residents’ welfare associations and office bearers of the Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad, also held a meeting on Friday afternoon and clarified that all issues regarding the matter have been resolved.The Neelpadam Kunj Apartment Owners Association, on May 7, issued a communication for stopping the entry and exit of doctors and health care workers from May 10, and asked them to make temporary arrangements for staying in Delhi till the nationwide lockdown -- imposed on March 25 to control the Covid-19 spread -- is in force.The association withdrew the notice within hours after it came in for heavy criticism on social media Thursday night. It issued another communication in which it said its “advisory notice was issued on the evening of May 7, 2020, by mistake and has been withdrawn in the night of May 7, 2020”.The association’s office-bearers said their communication to residents was based on a notification issued by Ghaziabad’s municipal commissioner to his zonal in-charges on May 5.The municipal commissioner’s notification had said the zonal in-charges should get in touch with RWAs and local councillors and request doctors and health care workers, who live in Ghaziabad but work in Delhi, to make arrangements for their stay in the national capital for the remaining duration of the lockdown.“We had issued a notice Thursday evening on the basis of the letter issued by the municipal commissioner. But our letter was withdrawn on Thursday night and another letter was issued about the withdrawal of our first letter. We didn’t have clarity about the letter from the municipal commissioner, which was in the form of an appeal and non-binding,” said Ram Tiwari, president of the board of managers of the association.He said about 35 families live in Neelpadam Kunj, one of the oldest high-rises in Ghaziabad having 568 flats.The controversy started after Ghaziabad’s chief medical officer NK Gupta wrote a letter on April 30, titled “appeal”, to municipal commissioner Dinesh Chandra. Gupta’s letter came in the wake of a number of Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad being linked to health care wrkers employed in Delhi. On May 5, Chandra forwarded Gupta’s letter to his zonal in-charges. He maintained his letter was an appeal and RWAs and councillors were to make “humble appeals” to doctors and health care workers. He told HT on Thursday the letter was issued in public interest and wasn’t binding.“We have also reiterated this to the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Ghaziabad. The appeal is non-binding. But it was issued with an intention to prevent people in high-rises from getting infected,” Gupta said, adding 25% of cases in the district are linked to health care workers and hospitals.The IMA office-bearers held a meeting with the Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey on Friday to discuss the issue. “The matter is over and everyone is certain that there is no confusion. The issue of the appeal (by the CMO) no longer exists,” Pandey said.He however did not reply when asked about the issue of April 30 letter of appeal issued by CMO and subsequent letter issues by Ghaziabad municipal commissioner of May 5.Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, chairman of the flat owners’ federation, who was present during the meeting, said, “There was no talk about dismissing the April 30 appeal. But everyone reached a consensus to fight the pandemic together. The RWAs should not stop anyone from coming in or going out.”Dr VB Jindal, president, IMA, Ghaziabad, said, “We give full support to the district administration. The issues have been resolved. We were told that the letters were in the form of appeal and non-binding. It is also acceptable to us that those attached to Covid duties should remain in active and passive quarantine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-outrage-ghaziabad-high-rise-withdraws-notice-to-stop-entry-of-doctors-health-workers/story-yPZK6dMsgx3Hr51wfJfQWK.html
08-05-2020||Noida||As commercial activities resume in Noida, 87,000 to get jobs||As the work at around 850 industries and 50 construction sites has resumed in Noida after the government allowed some relaxations in the lockdown, about 87,000 people, including 30,000 migrant workers, will be engaged in these commercial activities in the city. The industrial units alone will employ about 57,000, officials said. Among the 50 constriction sites are at least 20 group housing projects and Noida authority’s 30 infrastructure projects. Besides, work on the development of 50 new industrial units and commercial projects has also been started in the city, the officials said, adding that the resumption of commercial activities will help revive the local economy. At present, there are about 125,000 migrant construction workers in the city, the officials said.All these industrial units, group housing projects and other sites were shut completely after March 25, when the Centre announced nationwide lockdown with an aim to contain the Covid-19 spread. The lockdown has since been extended twice, the latest being up to May 17, but the Union government allowed some relaxations in lockdown rules from May 3 (only in non-containment zones) to help businesses get back on their feet.“We are issuing permissions to industries, construction sites and infrastructure projects as per the guidelines, provided the owners submit all requisite documents,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of Noida authority.According to the authority, there are at least 57,000 employees who will resume work at these 850 industrial units in the city. Also, at least 30,000 migrant construction labourers will get employment at construction sites and the infrastructure projects being developed by the authority. Besides its civic works, the Noida authority has resumed construction work at Sector 71/51 underpass, Chilla elevated road, underpasses on the Noida expressway, and Biodiversity Park. The authority CEO has directed the staff to finish formalities related with different civil works across the city in May and finish the work by June, before the monsoon sets in.“The authority will complete tendering process in May and try to finish repair of roads, drains, parks, footpaths and other civic works in June. Many works were disrupted and delayed due to the lockdown,” said a Noida authority official, requesting anonymity.However, industry owners and developers will have to follow all protocols, standard operating procedures and social distancing norms at their respective sites. On violation of norms, the permission will stand cancelled and legal action will follow, said the officials.Industry owners said that they have started operations as per new guidelines. “We have resumed our operations with reduced staff. Around 60,000 staff may start work in different units. But without a much needed relief package including interest free loan from the government, the industry will face huge financial issues,” said Vipin Malhan, president of Noida Entrepreneurs Association. Meanwhile, leading mobile manufacturing company Samsung has started its limited operations at its plant in Noida Phase -2 area from Thursday. The company, which employs about 10,000 people, has permission to resume work with 3,000 workers. Partha Ghosh, head of corporate communications (Southwest Asia), Samsung, said that the company had obtained requisite permissions to restart production at its Noida factory. “We hope to scale up our operation over a period of time. We are taking adequate care of our employees’ safety and security, following all the social distancing and hygiene norms as per the guidelines issued by the Centre and the state government after the Covid-19 outbreak,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/as-commercial-activities-resume-in-noida-87-000-to-get-jobs/story-WafRKil1yjkaANOvgiFAVL.html

08-05-2020||City||Acting as police volunteers, Ludhiana women show the way to serve society amid lockdown||At a time when venturing out of homes during the Covid-19 outbreak is risky, several city women have set an example to serve society during the lockdown by choosing to help out police in implementing curfew in the city as volunteers.These women volunteers, working from morning to evening with the police personnel in performing various duties, said their parents proudly allowed them to help the police during curfew.Meenu, 18, probably the youngest woman volunteer, wishes to join the police force as an officer in future. A resident of Kundanpuri, Meenu had appeared in Class 12 examinations, but the result was delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak.She said in this difficult time, she did not want to lose an opportunity to serve society. “When I talked to my parents about my wish to join the police as a volunteer, they did not think twice and gave their consent. I enrolled myself on the online portal of the police department. After being selected, I have been working from 8am to 6pm daily with the police,” said Meenu, whose father sells street food.“My duty is to ask commuters their reason to step out of home. I check their curfew passes. In case they don’t possess valid passes, I inform the police personnel on duty,” she said, adding that this has been a great learning experience for her.A total of eight women are working as volunteers with the Division Number 8 police station.Inspector Jarnail Singh, SHO at the police station, said the women volunteers, aged 18 to 40, were working hard to maintain law and order in the area.Volunteer Rama Sharma, 36, a teacher at a private school, said, “I could have chosen to stay home during the lockdown, but I decided to volunteer. I work from 8am to 10pm. Later, I go home and send online lessons to my students.”Shilpa, 33, mother of two children, said, “We are not facing any problem. We get food, water and other necessary articles while on duty. People are also polite to volunteers. Residents of my colony appreciate my initiative.”“After I decided to be a volunteer, I asked my family members, who proudly gave their consent to my decision. I have also worked as a traffic marshal with the traffic police,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/acting-as-police-volunteers-ludhiana-women-show-the-way-to-serve-society-amid-lockdown/story-eca5bYxCBCZ2vym1XHrNlM.html

08-05-2020||City||Pearl City: GMADA prepares ₹105 crore estimates for development works in Mohali’s Sectors 100 and 104||Acting on the Supreme Court directions, Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has prepared estimates of around ₹105 crore for internal development works in Mohali’s Sectors 100 and 104, which comprise the Pearl City project.The fate of around 1,300 allottees of Pearl City has been hanging in balance since 2014 after its chairman-cum-managing director Nirmal Singh Bhangoo was booked by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in a ₹45,000-crore Ponzi scam. The central agency had also attached all properties of Pearls Agrotech Corporation Limited (PACL), including the mega project launched in 2006.Around 160 families reside in both sectors, spread over 450 acres, where people have invested around ₹600 crore. Yet the sectors do not have a sewerage system, proper roads and streetlights.On March 4 this year, acting on the petition filed by the Pearl City Mohali Residents’ Welfare Association, the apex court had directed GMADA to prepare a detailed estimate plan for internal development works in the two sectors . During the hearing, the court also asked the association to submit the details of members with pending payments and other related documents.Internal development comprises construction of internal roads, laying of sewerage lines, landscaping, electrification, construction of sewage treatment plant and water supply lines.A senior GMADA official, who did not wish to be named, said: “Around ₹26 crore will be spent on roads, ₹21 crore on electrification and ₹55 crore on public health. We will submit the estimates during the next hearing, and the court will decide from where to get the funds. One option is collection of balance amount from the allottees.”Association president Kulbir Singh Sidhu said: “It’s high time GMADA intervenes to help the allottees, who spent their hard-earned money around a decade back, but have got nothing yet. We have full faith in the judiciary and hope we will get justice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pearl-city-gmada-prepares-105-crore-estimates-for-development-works-in-mohali-s-sectors-100-and-104/story-CUJLhueeU4V6ShHovNaN4L.html
08-05-2020||Mumbai||Police cannot infringe human dignity while implementing lockdown: HC||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court while appreciating the efforts of the police for ensuring proper observation of lockdown norms by the general public, has also chided them for being overzealous in their duty and has asked the commissioner of police to rein in such officers. The observations were prompted in a PIL which complained of police subjecting senior citizens and known personalities to humiliation by making photographs of these persons holding placards saying they are violators of lockdown, viral. The PIL prays for curbing of such high handedness of the police.A single bench of justice Rohit Deo while hearing public interest litigation through video conferencing filed by Sandip Nair was informed that in anxiety to strictly enforce the lockdown directives issued to combat the Covid Virus, certain personnel of the police force are guilty of gross violation of human rights. Advocate Anil Kamble submitted instances of senior citizens on morning walks, being subjected to inhuman indignities by the police in the form of alleged violators being photographed holding placards declaring that there are enemies of the nation, the society, the family and humanity as they are breaking the law.This Kamble submitted was published in prominent newspapers and have gone viral on social media. He said that making a humiliating spectacle of the violators is a serious infringement of human rights and the constitutional right guaranteed under Article 21 and hence sought directions to curb such high handedness of the police.The additional government pleader K S Joshi admitted that while some instances were true, others were uncorroborated and sought time to confirm whether the photographs were taken by the police.After hearing the submissions the court observed, “The police personnel who have indulged in a blatant violation of human dignity were expected to be alive to our society being a civilized society governed by the rule of law. While extraordinary situations may call for extraordinary measures, the measures must have the sanction of law. Human dignity and rights cannot be sacrificed at the altar of extraordinary situations nor can the constitutional right to a dignified life be hostage to supposed intentions. This Court would request the Police Commissioner to sensitise the personnel under his command to ensure that such sordid incidents do not occur.” The matter has been posted for hearing after May 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/police-cannot-infringe-human-dignity-while-implementing-lockdown-hc/story-HpFQB0u27wW12dunslvC0I.html

The attackers fired at least five bullets, two of which hit the man, who died during treatment at a government hospital later. Police suspect that the murder was the result of either a personal enmity or attempt to establish dominance in the illegal gambling business in the area.Deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Gaurav Sharma said the attackers have been identified and police teams are conducting raids to nab them. He said the victim, Raju, was a history-sheeter and had been released from jail two months ago.“Raju was involved in a murder case in 2018. He was also involved in cases of theft. Investigation has revealed that one of the killers is a friend of the man Raju had murdered in 2018. Hence, personal enmity or revenge killing cannot be ruled out in Raju’s murder,” said an investigator, on the condition of anonymity.According to the officer cited above, Raju was last seen with two men in a lane close to his home in Mukundpur. Around 9.30pm, the neighbours heard gunshot sounds in their neighbourhood and rushed out of their homes when Raju was found unconscious in the lane, bleeding. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where he died during treatment. The doctors told police that two bullet entry wounds were found – one each on his face and chest.“We have taken some people in custody for questioning. There are specific leads about the attackers. They will be caught soon,” the officer cited above added.This is the seventh murder which has been reported in the national Capital within the past four days, from May 4 to May 7.

But, the lockdown was extended again till May 17. How can the government expect us to pay the taxes when the industry is shut?”“The government should extend the last dates for filing taxes in proportion to the number of days for which the lockdown has been extended or the industry might face permanent closure,” Jindal added.Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) president Gurmeet Kular said, “It seems that the government is least concerned about the industry which is closed since March 22. The Union and state governments must extend the last dates for filing taxes. Further, interest and penalties on delayed payments should also be waived.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-industrialists-seek-extension-of-deadline-to-file-taxes/story-Fw7nc0giqMyMDCWqeXEJDL.html
08-05-2020||Delhi||Days after caretaker found covid-19 positive, four occupants in the shelter too test positive||Days after the caretaker of a shelter in central Delhi’s Jhandewalan was infected with Covid-19, four occupants from the shelter too tested positive for the disease on Friday morning. Shelter number-14 serves over 50 people and they share common toilets and other facilities. Since the caretaker was tested, the shelter management decided to test those that showed symptoms. With the new cases, the rest will likely be quarantined.According to Prabhas Chaudhary, supervisor of a cluster of nine such shelters in the area, said that the report has come positive for actually five occupants but because of a spelling mistake, authorities were not able to identify the other patient. “Nine persons with symptoms like fever and sore throat were tested on May 5 by a team of district health officials in a mobile van, five of who tested positive on Friday. All of them are aged between 30 and 45 years. We have requested authorities to reconfirm the status of the fifth person,” said Chaudhary. While the test results came at in at around 11am, it was only until 4.30pm that the patients were taken to the isolation facility in Karol Bagh.Chaudhary added that the shelter served 56 people, but only 20 slept here. “The rest would be here for most part of the day. They would be served food and the other facilities, but would go sleep somewhere else during the night on their carts,” he said. The cluster of nine shelters together house over 500 homeless people. The caretaker had tested positive on May 4. He was then shifted to AIIMS Jhajjar quarantine facility. Nidhi Srivastava, district magistrate (Central) said that only four persons in the shelter tested positive in the report that came on Friday morning. “We plan to move the occupants above 50 years old and those having ailments like tuberculosis to isolation facilities. The rest will be quarantined in the shelter itself,” said Srivastava. She added that occupants of other shelters with symptoms were now being screened. Sunil Kumar Aledia, a social activist who works for the homeless in the city, said that he will be writing to all district magistrates screen occupants in all the shelters under their jurisdiction. “So many people have complained of fever and other symptoms here but the screening started only after the caretaker tested positive. So many people are housed in these shelters. Just because they are poor doesn’t mean they are denied of their right to life and dignity. The government must understand the seriousness of the issue,” said Aledia. At least 3725 persons are housed across the 223 regular shelter homes of the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB). Besides the Delhi government has converted 256 school buildings into temporary shelter homes to house thousands of migrants, who were stranded during the ongoing lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/days-after-caretaker-found-covid-19-positive-four-occupants-in-the-shelter-too-test-positive/story-ePem8D6CcSwqiI3xYVhJhJ.html
08-05-2020||City||Construction workers demand second round of compensation||New Delhi: With the national lockdown extended till May 17, construction workers belonging to the unorganised sector in Delhi have demanded from the government financial assistance for the month of May.In a recent letter to state labour minister Gopal Rai, the secretary of the Delhi Asangathit Nirman Mazdoor Union, Thaneshwar Adigaur, also requested the government to finish up pending registrations of new and old workers so that benefits of the government’s schemes reach more people. Construction workers in the unorganised sector can register themselves with the state government at an annual fee of Rs 20, to be renewed on a yearly basis. The process is online, and helps registered works avail government benefits of welfare schemes such as those regarding loans and pensions.While the Delhi government has allowed construction activity in the city, it has permitted operations only at in-situ projects where construction workers are available on site. However, those who are part of the unorganised sector won’t be able to work as they do not live at the construction sites. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in April had given a one-time financial assistance to the construction workers registered with it. Close to 40,000 workers were paid Rs 5,000 each during the lockdown.“There are lakhs of construction workers who have been rendered unemployed due to the lockdown. The lockdown has been extended and there is no clarity on how and by when construction workers, who are in the unorganised sector, would get work. We had requested the government to approve another chapter of financial assistance so that these people can take care of their families,” said Adigaur.When contacted, labour minister Gopal Rai’s office said no decision in this regard has been taken as of now. “The matter is under consideration,” said an official, asking not to be identified.Adigaur, who is also a member of the advisory committee of the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board, said they have requested the government to also complete the registration process of construction workers who have recently applied, and to renew the registration of older members. “These people should also be brought under the ambit of financial assistance provided by the government. The government should reconstitute the welfare board and call a meeting of the advisory committee so that necessary measures can be taken for the welfare of construction workers,” said Adigaur.A senior Delhi government official with the labour department, requesting anonymity, said, “All measures have been taken to provide the necessary support to construction workers in the unorganised sector. The government is keeping a close watch on issues concerning labourers and construction workers in the city.”Following guidelines of the Union ministry of home affairs in relaxation of lockdown norms, the AAP government said construction work in the city can resume if the employer makes arrangements for the stay of workers. Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain on Friday said, “Construction work has been allowed in Delhi, and it will take time to start again. For construction workers, the employers should make their stay arrangements at their respective sites.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/construction-workers-demand-second-round-of-compensation/story-aDbvU7bJ6Q6mEOCRmixJMN.html

A Delhi government record has recently revealed only 24-30% students are attending online classes being conducted by the Directorate of Education (DoE) for class 12 students. As per the Telecom regulatory authority of India data, the county’s internet penetration stood at 52.08% in 2019. Appearing for the Delhi government, its standing counsel, Ramesh Singh, accepted the notice following which the matter was posted for further hearing on June 6.On the last date of hearing, the court had asked the petitioner to place some additional documents on record detailing the name of the students affected among other information. Following this, advocate Jha, on Friday gave a list of students while highlighting the Hindustan Times report.The plea said not providing laptops, phone and high-speed internet, free of cost, to poor kids would amount to a violation of their fundamental right to education guaranteed under the Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/plea-in-delhi-hc-seeks-laptops-internet-for-poor-students-to-attend-online-classes/story-27mcBnolbfjqvFPHC5kbAI.html

Worse, the priests have not been paid for the six Covid-related cremations conducted here, neither by the family of the deceased nor by the district administration that arranged the last rites.Having run into financial difficulties, the priests have now refused to cremate any more Covid-19 patients. Four people who succumbed to coronavirus disease and two suspected patients have been cremated here so far.One of the two priests, Pankaj Sharma, said he will not perform last rites of Covid patients in future.“Neither the administration not the patients’ families offer us anything in return. On the other hand, other city residents have also stopped bringing their dead to our cremation ground, afraid of contracting the virus,” says Sharma, whose father was also a priest.“It is our only source of living. Whatever the family of the dead offered us, helped to keep our kitchen fire burning. But, now we have run out of any means. If the situation persists how will we feed our families?” says Gurdev Singh, the other priest.‘STAYING AWAY FROM FAMILIES’The priests have also been staying away from their families for their safety. “I have visited home only once since the lockdown began, and even then I did not hug my two children. We have not been provided prophylactic (preventive) treatment. We also have no insurance cover. In such a situation, how can we continue to cremate the Covid-19 patients,” asked Pankaj.Ranjodh Singh, president of Ramgarhia Educational Trust, that manages the crematorium, said he had written to the civic body commissioner to provide health cover to the people performing cremations.Municipal commissioner Kanwalpreet Kaur Brar said, “Families should pay for the last rites of their deceased kin. It is unfortunate. I will raise the matter with the authorities concerned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/priests-cremating-covid-patients-can-t-keep-kitchen-fire-running/story-85Di3oGdQoomGPgyBgJ1ML.html

In February, she matched with Fahim Reyansh based in London. He told her he works at a construction company at Huddersfield in London.Reyansh kept talking to the woman for over a month and gained her trust. Around March 15, he told her he has sent her a gift. A few days later, she received a call from a man, who claimed to be a customs officer.“The ‘customs officer’ asked her to pay ₹37,000 towards a 12-kg parcel. Later, he asked her to pay ₹1.8 lakh penalty, claiming they found £30,000 in the parcel. Reyansh sent the woman an audio message and requested her to pay whatever she can. She paid another ₹40,000,” said an officer from Nerul police.When the callers demanded more money, she called the customs department to enquire about the penalty amount only to learn that she was cheated. Soon after, she received a friend request from a woman named Dilipa Gupta, who too tried a similar trick.

So, when Verma got to know about an initiative where local tailors were required to make masks, which were to be donated to the corona warriors, she joined in without much ado. “There is no bigger act of kindness than helping others, especially in difficult times like these. I, too, wanted to help in the best possible way, and I know stitching so I thought of using my skills to help others who are fighting to keep us safe. I got to know that the volunteers were taking up the task of stitching masks at the Brahma Kumaris centre near my house, and decided to be a volunteer in this cause,” says Verma, a Dwarka-resident. Kamla, from the NGO, says, “We had asked DCP Dwarka District about what do they need the most in this fight against coronavirus. And we got to know that masks are a primary need, then sought help of locals, and managed to stitch thousands of masks, which were then handed over to the police official to be distributed to their officers and other corona warriors, and even the underprivileged.” To be compassionate, one doesn’t need money and this coming forward of residents to stitch masks voluntarily, sets a perfect example for others to follow. Another resident of this area, Hari Kishan, prefered to stitch masks from his home. He says, “I pick up the cloth from the centre and stitch them at my home. I feel happy that I am able to use the lockdown time to help those who are working day in and out for us.” Anto Alphose, DCP Dwarka, says, “We received 1,100 masks from the NGO, and the best part was that these were prepared keeping in mind the samples we had shared with them. The masks were distributed among the police personnel and other needy people. We want to thank them for reaching out to us and checking on if we need soemthing amid this pandemic. Together we can fight and overcome this situation.” Other than the Dwarka police station, masks were also handed over to the head of the Police Stations in Dabri, Bindapur and Najafgarh. Sunil Mittal, SHO, Najafgarh police station, says, “We received 500 masks from the volunteers at the Dwarka centre of the NGO, and we distributed them to the needy during our food drive. We want to thank these volunteers and residents for their beautiful and timely gesture in these difficult times.” Follow @htdelhi for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-lockdown-dwarka-residents-unite-to-stitch-masks-for-corona-warriors/story-wpCqMRoKhA9tjb76CJfEdN.html

The land-owning agency will soon start inspecting properties while processing the applications—the inspections had been on hold due to the outbreak of Covid-19.A senior DDA official said that surveyors have been directed to follow social distancing norms while inspecting the properties. “We will soon resume the inspection of properties, except in Covid-19 containment zones. Surveyors will contact the applicants in advance. They will visit the properties of willing applicants only. Surveyors have been advised to strictly adhere to social distancing norms and take other necessary precautions,” the official said.The official added, “In order to continue services during the Covid-19 lockdown, the back-end scrutiny of applications will be carried out as the scheme is totally online.”Land-owning agencies have started the process of conferring ownership rights to people living in these 1,731 unauthorised colonies in December last year. They gave registries to 20 property owners in January, just before the assembly elections in Delhi. The ownership rights are being conferred under the Prime Minister-Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana (PM-UDAY).So far, more than 2.57 lakh people have registered on the PM-UDAY portal to apply for ownership rights. Close to 70,000 registrants have also got their properties GIS mapped through empanelled agencies, of which the survey of 65,000 properties is complete.The process was initially stalled due to the model code of conduct during Delhi assembly elections and later due to the outbreak of Covid-19.The land-owning agency has opened the processing centres at Dwarka, Pitampura, Hauz Khas and Laxmi Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dda-shifts-ownership-application-for-unauthorised-colonies-online/story-8uEXx1J1WhHecEhH2epdPI.html

08-05-2020||Mumbai||Air India employee unions move HC, challenges 10% deductions in salary||Three Air India employee unions have moved the Bombay high court on Thursday challenging 10% deduction in their salary on account of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.The petitions filed by Air India Aircraft Engineers’ Association (AIEA), All India Service Engineers Association and Indian Pilots Guild, through advocates Jane Cox and Karishma Rao, are likely to come up for hearing next week.Both groups of engineers are employed by Air India Engineering Services Limited, a 100% subsidiary of Air India, while the pilots are employed directly by the national carrier. The petition said that on March 20, 2020, Air India announced 10% deduction for three months from the allowance package of all employees, except the cabin crew, on account of the impact of coronavirus.“It is in blatant violation of the directives issued by Government of India, especially government order dated 29 March 2020, prohibiting employers from making any pay cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, regardless of whether or not establishments are operational,” states petition filed by AIEA and adds that the state authorities are personally liable for the implementation of the government order. It adds that in the case of most of the employees’ allowances form a major part of their wage bracket and in some case it exceeds 60℅ of their monthly salary, resulting in large deductions. The petition states that the deduction for March 2020 was most shocking, as the employees have worked for 24 days during the month before the nationwide lockdown was imposed.The petition adds that even otherwise employer-employee relationship continues and since the employees are willing to work, the employers are bound to pay their agreed monthly wages. Such wage deduction amounts to a change in service condition and therefore in breach of legal provisions, it adds.The unions have urged the court to restrain Air India and AIESL from making any further deductions from their future salaries. They have also sought a direction for payment of the 10℅ allowances deducted from their March 2020 salaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/air-india-employee-unions-move-hc-challenges-10-deductions-in-salary/story-RkC7cr1Gxm9UCAEN980oyK.html

The whole process is linked to the Aarogya Setu app which sends a green or red alert on the bases of personal information filled by the applicant.“This is also a workflow-based system that redirects all the applications to sub-divisional magistrates of the concerned area,” said Sharma. The system also keeps a check number of passes issued per day.Once a person gets permission to enter the state, all their details and that of co-travelers are redirected to the field staff in the concerned area.The same software is used to assign such person a surveillance officer or direct them to go into home quarantine or institutional quarantine, and discharge certificate. The surveillance officer uses the application to file daily follow up of the quarantined person including if they jump quarantine.In case a person is tested Covid-19 positive, then all their travel history including the vehicle used is available on the application which can further be used to trace the primary contacts outside or within the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kangra-admn-to-step-up-vigil-against-home-quarantined-persons-via-surveillance-software/story-LFiIJybIJasPJ6jWyvBAjK.html

Four of these employees have undergone a Covid-19 test and their results have already come out negative.“We will inject the recombinant Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine to them on Saturday. This trial will be performed on 175 persons, including doctors, staff nurses, attendants and others looking after Covid-19 patients at PGIMS and the family members of the positive patients, who have tested negative for the virus. Under this research trial, we will give rBCG vaccine to 131 persons (aged above 18 with no disease) and the remaining 44 will be given placebo (no treatment). To perform these trials, we received a stock of 75 vaccines and we will get the remaining ones in the next two to three days,” Dr Verma added.Professor Verma said that they will conduct this research about the efficacy of rBCG vaccine for the next six months.“Early Covid-19 trends show that the deadly virus is not severe in developing countries, where TB vaccines are given to infants. This rBCG vaccine is being used for trial as it improves immunity and has anti-viral properties. The final research will tell us whether this vaccine is helpful in tackling the virus or not,” Professor Ramesh Verma added.The drug controller general of India (DCGI) has granted permission to five sites, including PGIMS, Rohtak, to hold a clinical trial for the rBCG for the next six months. The research is being conducted under the guidance of Professor of pharmacology and general investigator Dr Savita Verma, head of pulmonary and critical care medicine, Dr Dhruva Chaudhary and Dr Ramesh Verma.Dr Dhruva Chaudhary, who is also the coronavirus nodal officer at the institution, said that the BCG vaccine was developed to protect children from tuberculosis and they expect that the rBCG vaccine may offer protection against the severity of Covid-19 as it is helpful in tackling other infectious diseases too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rohtak-pgims-starts-screening-for-bcg-vaccine-trials/story-odYRfWhO17IRx3Hh09Xx9M.html

The logbooks at the district level have information about the returnees collected by officials while talking to them over phone, the sources said. After returning to the state, the migrant workers are transported by buses to their native places where they are quarantined as per the Covid-19 protocols. The first special train run by the railways after suspension of its operation due to the lockdown ferried around 1200 migrant workers from Lingampally in Telangana to Hatia in Ranchi on the World Labour day (May 1). The 24-coach train was the first in the country to transport stranded migrant workers after the Centre had permitted inter-state movement by relaxing the coronavirus-induced lockdown. Since then, thousands of migrant workers and students have come back to the state by special trains from far-off places like Kerala, Telangana, Kota in Rajasthan and Punjab. Many others travelled back home in buses from Punjab, Telangana and Chhattisgarh, among others. To help people from other states who are stranded in Jharkhand, the state government has launched ‘Jharkhand sahayata portal’ where they can register themselves, an official statement said. These people can register themselves on http://covid19reg.jharkhand.gov.in/ and the state government will make arrangements for their return, it said.

08-05-2020||City||Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad integral part of India, our duty to look after its people: J&K IMD director||After the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has included regions of Gilgit-Baltistan and Muzaffarabad as part of its Jammu and Kashmir meteorological sub-division, director of J&K IMD Sonum Lotus said, “Since they are our people, we should look after their concerns.”Gilgit-Baltistan and Muzaffarabad are territories currently under Pakistani occupation.In February 1994, the Parliament passed a unanimous resolution, which stated: “the state of Jammu and Kashmir has been, is and shall be an integral part of India and any attempts to separate it from the rest of the country will be resisted by all necessary means; and that Pakistan must vacate the areas of the Indian state of J&K, which they have occupied through aggression; and resolves that all attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of India will be met resolutely.”Sonum said that media should disseminate information of IMD weather forecasts for the people in Pak occupied Kashmir and they, for now, can log on to IMD’s website https://mausam.imd.gov.in/ for daily weather forecasts.He, however, said that there was nothing “new” and “surprising” in weather forecasts for the Pak occupied Kashmir.“There is nothing new. Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh entirety belong to India and we are doing it for our people including those from Gilgit- Baltistan, and Muzaffarabad following the reorganisation of the state of J&K”, he added.“While the people of Gilgit-Baltistan and Muzaffarabad will get updates on the IMD website to keep them abreast with weather forecasts, we may also ensure that their representatives get the weather forecast on their mails in the near future. This is the beginning. Let’s see how the government wants to go further,” he said.The official said that the basic purpose of including these areas in its Jammu and Kashmir meteorological sub-division is because “people in these regions are our people and it is our responsibility to look after their concerns.”Lotus said that following the reorganisation of the J&K into two union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, it was decided to include these areas under the Ladakh region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gilgit-baltistan-muzaffarabad-integral-part-of-india-our-duty-to-look-after-its-people-j-k-imd-director/story-R0upMaw2qoK6kWiop8sSkO.html

While 27 patients were discharged on April 28 and 29, the number was in the 50s right from May 1 to May 6. The percentage of ‘active’ cases (positive cases without number of dead and discharged) to positive cases had also declined from 79 per cent on April 28 to 65 per cent on May 6, Agarwal said.In an interview she said, this was a very positive trend and encouraging for the government and the local administration. “The lockdown has definitely helped bring down the doubling ratio of positive patients,” she said.The senior civic official said that the mortality rate for Pune had dropped from a high of 9 per cent to 5.8 per cent and the authorities were now confident of bringing it down further.“Even the doubling rate of Covid-19 positive cases has risen to 12 days in Pune,” she said.Agarwal attributed the early detection of positive cases to PMC’s door-to-door survey and increased testing. “This is helping us find the positive patients in the early stages. Now we are hoping that cure ratio will increase more as the maximum number of positive patients will be completing their 14 days treatment in the coming days,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-city-registers-drop-in-covid-19-mortality-rate-rise-in-daily-discharge-of-cured-patients/story-DtuRQgIjKHErM2ygxoUdgK.html

The patient from Orai in Uttar Pradesh was admitted to the King George Medical University (KGMU) in Lucknow on April 26. “After 13 days, the condition of the patient is stable and he is still on ventilator. We can’t say when he will be discharged,” KGMU Vice Chancellor M L B Bhatt said.  Dr Tulika Chandra of Blood Transfusion department, KGMU said, “When the patient was given plasma therapy his condition was very bad. Now his lungs have improved. But as he is old and has diabetes, he has been kept on ventilator. A team of doctors are keeping an eye on him.” The patient was administered plasma donated by a doctor from Canada who was the first Covid-19 patient admitted to KGMU and later recovered. Convalescent plasma therapy is an experimental procedure for Covid-19 patients. In this treatment, plasma, a blood component, from a cured patient is transfused to a critically ill coronavirus patient. The blood of a person who has recovered from Covid-19 develops antibodies to fight the virus. This therapy uses antibodies from the blood of a cured coronavirus patient to treat another critical patient. The process of donating plasma is similar to that of donating blood and takes about an hour.  Union health ministry had advised against considering plasma therapy to be regular treatment for coronavirus and said that it should be used for research and trial purposes till there’s robust scientific evidence to support its efficacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-s-first-covid-patient-to-undergo-plasma-therapy-stable-say-doctors/story-CqwpDr61IDcstXfxVXFhcL.html

08-05-2020||Kolkata||Social stigma, low testing behind WB’s high Covid-19 mortality rate: Report||Social stigma and low testing are the key reasons for the high mortality rate among Covid-19 patients in West Bengal, where the disease, like elsewhere in the country, is still an urban phenomenon, experts say.The state’s TMC government has been drawing consistent criticism from the Centre and opposition parties over the way it has tackled the pandemic, and has been accused of under- reporting data about the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths.As of May 7, the state has reported 1,548 Covid-19 cases and 151 deaths of people infected with the deadly virus.However, the state’s public health authorities have attributed only 79 fatalities to the contagion and the rest to concurrent illnesses called comorbidities in medical jargon.The centre recently rapped the state government over its Covid-19 management which, it said, was characterised by a very low rate of testing in proportion to the population, and a very high rate of mortality of 13.2 per cent, the highest in the country.West Bengal, which had tested just about 4,400 samples by April 18 at a rate of 400 samples per day, is now testing more than 2,500 samples a day. The aggregate now stands at more than 30,000, according to state officials.Experts in the field say given the fact that most cases were reported from Kolkata, Howrah, Hooghly, North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas, the disease is still an urban phenomenon” but will spread to rural areas also sooner or later.According to public health experts and medical practitioners in the frontline of the fight against the disease, not just the low number of tests but the social stigma and ostracism faced by patients and their families are acting as a deterrent to effective tackling of the pandemic.Social stigma is a major issue in identifying a Covid patient. Since the spurt in the number of cases, people have stopped coming to hospital fearing social stigma and public shaming in their locality and instead prefer to stay home. And when they do turn up, its too late, professor and senior surgeon at SSKM hospital Diptendra Sarkar told PTI.“The stigma associated with this disease needs to be addressed so that more people come forward for tests, he said.Manas Gumta, a senior surgeon and general secretary of Association of Health Service Doctors, shared Sarkar’s view and said it is the responsibility of the state government to chalk out a roadmap to remove the social slur associated with the disease.“The government needs to engage social groups and NGOs to address the problem of social stigma. It is indeed a reason behind fewer people coming forward for tests,” he said.Gumta said the number of tests being performed now are still less than what has been recommended by ICMR. The numbers need to be increased substantially and also the testing facilities, he said.While decoding the arithmetic behind the higher mortality rate, he said the mortality rate of Covid-19 patients in most countries was 2-3 per cent, but in Bengal it was so high due to fewer tests being conducted since the onset of the disease.For example, if you test 20 people and 10 are found positive while two of those who test positive pass away then your mortality rate is 20 per cent. But, if you test 50 people and 40 are found positive and two of them die, your mortality rate is 5 per cent.“So the answer to decreasing the mortality rate lies in conducting more tests, random tests of asymptomatic patients and ramping up life support infrastructure at hospitals, he said.West Bengal, despite the increase in the number of tests, lags far behind states like Maharashtra and Gujarat where the number of tests has crossed two lakh and one lakh respectively.In most of the death cases, the patients arrived when it was too late. But if intensive and critical care facilities can be ramped up, many lives can be saved. We are a bit late but we are trying to catch up with other states in terms of testing and treatment, said another senior doctor of a Covid hospital who did not wish to be named.West Bengal Home Secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay had recently attributed the low tests and high mortality rate to initial lack of testing laboratories. Only one Covid-19 testing laboratory was functioning in the initial days of the outbreak of the disease.Today, we have 16 testing laboratories and a few others are in the pipeline. The more testing you do, the more people you treat and then the mortality rate will also be low.“The mortality rate appeared high not because Bengal was failing but because (adequate) infrastructural facilities were not present, Bandopadhyay said.The West Bengal government had alleged last month that the Covid-19 testing kits supplied by the Centre were far less in number as compared to other states and many were defective.Meanwhile, some experts feel that though the disease has so far been limited to urban areas, it will spread to rural Bengal in the coming months.It is true that the contagion is still an urban phenomenon but in months to come it will spread to other rural areas. In urban areas, the intensity of the spread is high because of high population density which is not the case in rural areas, senior doctor and internal medicine specialist Rahul Jain said.Out of the 23 districts of the state seven predominantly rural districts have not reported a single Covid-19 case so far, according to state government data.At least 80 per cent of the cases have been reported from the four red zones districts of Howrah, North 24 Parganas, East Medinipur and Kolkata, with the state capital having the highest number of containment zones and cases.South 24 Parganas and Hooghly districts have also reported quite a few cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/social-stigma-low-testing-behind-wb-s-high-covid-19-mortality-rate-report/story-VGGBAEy2IXueEplUxOGX3N.html

08-05-2020||Noida||Hospital staff protests outside Red Zone residential society amid blame-game on Covid-19 infection||Some staff members of a private hospital in Noida protested outside a residential society, whose residents have accused them of risking people with coronavirus as its two health care workers tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday.Over three dozen staffers of the Felix Hospital in Sector 137 protested in the evening outside the Ajnara Daffodil, where a 41-year-old female resident was detected with the novel coronavirus infection on May 5, according to an official report.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageA representative of the society, however, said it was “not desirable” for health care workers to assemble in that manner knowing well that the sector is a containment zone and the matter could have been resolved amicably.D K Gupta, a doctor and chairman of Felix Hospital, said two of his staff members tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday and one of them, a nurse, had come in contact with the female patient in the residential society on April 27.  “The nurse had gone to the society to attend to a third-stage cancer patient because of an emergency. That patient had earlier been travelling to Delhi for treatment. Now some residents of the society are blaming the nurse and our hospital of being carriers of the infection, when actually the nurse got infected from the patient,” Gupta told PTI.“After the Ajnara Daffodil resident was found positive for coronavirus, our nurse was also tracked through contact tracing and other people who had come in her contact, including our staff, were quarantined and then tested. Now two of them have been found positive for coronavirus,” he said.The doctor said his hospital was now mulling filing a complaint with the police over some residents of the society falsely claiming that 80 per cent of his staff was infected with the novel virus.“We have a staff of more than 300 people at Felix Hospital and claiming that 80 per cent of them are infected with Covid-19 is just not correct. They are putting it out on social media and everywhere. We will file a police complaint against them,” Gupta said.D P Juyal, President of the Apartment Owners’ Association of Ajnara Daffodil, said the protest gathering was dispersed by the police soon.“Who infected whom is a matter on which more clarity is needed and is controversial. However, assembling in a crowd like this and raising slogans is not desirable at a time like this because this sector is in a containment zone already and it adds to the risk,” he told PTI.“Today two of the hospital staff have been found infected with the virus and you cannot stop anyone from raising concern over the safety of the people. The hospital officials could have called us and the matter could have been solved amicably over a dialogue,” Juyal added.Meanwhile, the society remains sealed with in and out movement restricted in view of the coronavirus case there.Notably, the Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday approved the UP Public Health and Epidemic Disease Control Ordinance, 2020, which protect ‘corona warriors’ (frontline workers against Covid-19) such as doctors, paramedical staff, sanitary workers, and police personnel by making actions against them as punishable acts.Those misbehaving with healthcare workers, paramedical staff, police personnel or sanitation workers in Noida and Greater Noida may land in jail for up to seven years along with having to cough out a fine up to Rs 5 lakh, according to the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/hospital-staff-protests-outside-red-zone-residential-society-amid-blame-game-on-covid-19-infection/story-PTu3hjPR8T5IAYVefWM7zH.html
08-05-2020||Lucknow||Bahraich villagers team up for food security on a rainy day||Faced with the influx of jobless migrants returning home and the fear that the government and NGOs may stop assistance once the pandemic subsides and the lockdown ends, villagers in Bahraich have devised their own survival strategy. They have formed grain banks (which run without any government intervention) to help sustain the needy on a rainy day.Dwarika Prasad, 45, of Kailashnagar village in Bahraich district has donated 20 kg wheat out of the total harvest of over one quintal from his one bigha landholding to the village grain bank.He and several other villagers of more than five dozen villages of the district have been contributing regularly to the grain bank (anaj bank) set up in each village to help the poor and needy, specially post the Covid lockdown, as villagers think assistance may not come their way then.When the government imposed the lockdown, a number of migrant workers returned to their villages, feeling they would at least get two meals a day.“We saw our people coming back with a sense of insecurity and fear, whether or not they would be able to go back and start life again. They were happy that they were with their family now,” said Geeta Prasad of Kailash Nagar, also a member of the anaj bank of his village.He said the question of their livelihood prodded him and several others to thrash out a solution that could provide relief in the grey days. “The government is taking care of the basic need of food right now but once the lockdown is over, the government will stop the assistance. What will the poor families do then? A month later the monsoon will arrive and no one will be able to harvest crops or get any work anywhere easily. Post the lockdown, the situation may become grimmer,” said Prasad, adding, “We had to think about the future.” An NGO Dehat, which is active in Bahraich, came up with the idea of anaj bank. “When we came to know about their worries, we suggested running it like a bank. Food will be given to a needy person and he will be asked to donate the grain back during winter crop harvesting,” said coordinator of Dehat Jitendra Chaturvedi. He said committees had been formed in 61 villages of the district and around 106 quintals of wheat had been deposited in the bank.Pawan Yadav of Chalwa village said, “Initially villagers did not buy this idea but gradually they understood the concept. We are reaching out to farmers who can afford to donate 10 kg of wheat from their farm. Every village has a committee and every donation is accounted for.”“During rainy days, we have planned to give the grain from our bank to the needy, with an optional rider that he or she would return the same amount of paddy in the winter. We won’t force them to return it but this is an effort to keep this bank alive. Village committee will take a final call on the waiver,” said Karan Kumar Upadhyay of Jamaniya village of Bahraich.Phulwa, a 59-year-old woman of Lohara village said, “My son worked in Delhi as a daily wager but now he is back with his family.” The woman who has a small landholding of almost a bigha, said, “The monsoon will arrive next month and floods will hit the village. Our landholding is small and that too without any produce. So the anaj bank is a great help to me and several other families like us.”The land will remain unused, especially in villages which are usually hit by floods in the rainy season. “They will sow paddy and harvest it in December and January,” said Devesh Awasthi, a local youth activist.He said, “All the NGOs and government agencies are providing all kinds of help these days but it won’t last long.Many people do not have land; some have empty land due to other reasons. What will they do after the government stops assisting and social organizations also stop their activities?”Village head of Kailash Nagar Ramesh Kumar said, “Villagers are excited about the grain bank and those in need have high hopes. Actually this is a transparent model. Those who donate grain can actually see where the grain has been used. There is no interference of the government. This is an effort of the villagers for the villagers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/bahraich-villagers-team-up-for-food-security-on-a-rainy-day/story-IFCKKLXNCIsGs3jx1WyoIK.html

08-05-2020||Football||Korea kicks-off with baseball and football, world watches||Having earned global acclaim for containing Covid-19 and conducting elections in the time of a pandemic, South Korea has again got the world looking towards it. The east Asian country started its baseball season on Tuesday and will kick-off K-League, its top football competition, on Friday. “Because it is South Korea, fewer eyebrows will be raised,” said India captain Sunil Chhetri. At the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, South Korea was one of the worst affected countries behind China, the epicentre. But with some of the most aggressive testing and contact tracing done anywhere in the world, they also quickly became the model of how to fight the pandemic. “The start of K-league is definitely encouraging news for everyone in Asia,” said India head coach Igor Stimac from Split, Croatia. “But let’s be patient and see how things settle down in other countries. We all miss the games and our normal routine. But rushing back too soon might cause greater damage.”Some of the things shown in the K-League promotional video clip won’t happen—like players throwing shirts to the crowd. There won’t be a crowd, at least now. Celebrations too are unlikely to see hugs, huddles and players in a heap. But when Jeonbuk FC take on Suwon Bluewings on Friday, the world of sport will hope it is the first step in a restoration act.“If I can, I will watch them,” said Spanish footballer Jaime Gavilan, who played for Bluewings in 2016-17. Having recently been permitted to step outside for a run, Gavilan, 34, said life in Madrid now is “comme ci comme ca (so-so)”. “But they (South Korea) make things better than here. That is why they can start the league, one of the most important in Asia.” Gavilan also played for ATK in the ISL, and now plays in the Spanish second division.South Korea will be the first country that played in the 2018 World Cup to start football. And it has spiked interest in a planet starved of live sport. From struggling to get a new broadcaster at the start of the season, K-League 1 and 2 now has a lead broadcaster and two more for the domestic audience and has sold rights to 17 countries, China, Hong Kong and Croatia among them. Negotiations are on with at least four more, according to a report on Friday by the K-League. On-line football platforms from Singapore, Holland and Britain too have acquired video licenses.“We hope fans will forget about the virus when they watch the K-League,” K-League president Kwon Oh-gap told The Guardian.Football federations of different countries have asked K-League how they can resume playing, he said, days before news broke that Bundesliga could resume later this month, the Super Lig in Turkey would restart on June 12 and that players in La Liga and Serie A have begun training.To start the season, K-League paid for testing players and staff — all 1100 of them. The league president said the go-ahead was contingent upon South Korea being able to keep the number of patients to below 30 for two weeks. There have been 13 new cases over the past three days in the country, all of them international passengers, according to a AFP report on Thursday. South Korea has reported 256 deaths due to Covid-19, according to worldometers.info. K-League coaches will wear masks, there will be no handshakes and if anyone returns a positive test, the team won’t play for at least a fortnight. Players will be allowed to drink only from bottles with their names on them. They will be warned for talking, spitting on the pitch and blowing their nose.“That will give another layer of protection,” said Chhetri, locked down in Bengaluru and recovering from surgery. “Let’s say someone who is positive slips through despite the best effort. To protect the rest, they won’t be allowed to talk when they are close to a player. It will be difficult to ensure this but these are not normal times. I am also sure physical distancing requirements will make the shower area different.”Chhetri said he would be, “very apprehensive and a little happy” if he had to play now. “Apprehensive because of the way it spreads and worried that everyone involved in a game, right down to the ball kids, could be carrying the virus. When we start, we will have to think about all these things. Eventually this day will come for every country. When a vaccine is out things will be different.”Five-time Olympic rowing champion Steve Redgrave has questioned the idea of playing without fans, saying it is motivated by business. For example, not resuming the Premier League in England could mean a deficit of 1 billion pounds, the league has said. “I genuinely don’t feel people are thinking clearly about the ramifications if we don’t play…it’s partly about money. And we should all care about the money,” said Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish in an AP report. In his interview in The Guardian, Redgrave has said, “the object of sport is to bring people together, and inspire them.” But till a vaccine comes along, Chhetri said, playing behind closed doors will be the new normal. “I don’t see how we will be back to packed stadiums before that.”Players will find empty stadiums a strange experience, said Gavilan. In 2015 when he was at ATK, the average attendance in Kolkata for ISL games was over 50,000. The maximum for a Bluewings game in 2016-17 was around 15,000, he said.England cricketer Jos Buttler though sees crowdless venues differently. “There is no one watching you and you are playing because you love the game,” he told Lancashire Cricket.Exactly how K-League players feel will be known by the weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/korea-kicks-off-with-baseball-and-football-world-watches/story-upZp5XEUnVmGdP4U49m7iO.html

However, there was no response from the state government, they alleged.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in a tweet posted two letters sent by her party’s Rae Bareli and Amethi district unit presidents asking their respective district administration to provide a list of migrant labourers. She also posted two mobile numbers urging residents of the two cities to provide a photocopy of their rail ticket to enable the party pay them the rail fare. “Congress president Sonia Gandhi has announced that party is ready to pay the rail fare to every migrant labourer. Migrant labourers have been left alone in the country’s fight against Covid-19,” said Lallu and Mishra.They said charging rail fare from the migrants was a shameful act and alleged that the state government also did not provide permission to their party workers to make arrangements for providing refreshments to migrant labourers on their way back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-not-providing-list-of-migrants-cong/story-kUPeqC9MbtikZOpvjONRfP.html

The police however pacified the angry villagers of Mahua village by telling them that all the migrants were subjected to thermal scanning and showed no symptoms of having contracted the infectious coronavirus. “These migrants would be quarantined in their homes in the village,” the police said. These aren’t isolated incidents. Nearly 3000 migrant workers who returned to Gorakhpur from Mumbai and Surat by ‘Shramik Special’ trains run specifically to fetch the migrants were subjected to discrimination at times from their own family and some of them also reported instances of misbehavior. Mohammad Ilyas, 33, who worked in dye making factory in Maharashtra returned home by Shramik Express on May 4. After undergoing thermal screening and filling up details in prescribed form at the railway station he travelled on foot to his home in Gorakhnath where he was denied entry by his wife Shabana who called up the local corporator to get her husband screened for coronavirus infection. Ilyas had to wait for hours outside and was allowed entry only after a team of doctors checked and cleared that he was free him of any infection. In Qazipur Khurd village under Sahjanwa block of Gorakhpur, from where three positive cases have been reported so far, over 15 migrants have been quarantined. Their quarantine period would be over between May 8 to 12 and a group of villagers are keeping watch on them to ensure they complete their period in quarantine. “Armed with sticks, 5-6 men keep eye on the quarantine center (primary school) and if any one attempts to come out and roam outside the quarantine centre, these villagers chase them back,” the villagers said. “The fear has gone up and so is the level of alertness. Villagers have blocked entry of outsiders to the village. If any outsider is spotted, the villagers inform the police,” Maneesh Yadav of Rampur village in Sant Kabir Nagar said. Rafat Hussain, the village head of Ramgarh village of Sidhdharthanagar, however said that in his village some migrants were allowed to directly visit their homes. “In our village 15 migrants arrived on May 4 from Maharashtra and were sent home directly after thermal screening and advised home quarantine. However many of them aren’t following the advisory and have started roaming around. I have already appealed to them to follow the guidelines on home quarantine but what can I do if they don’t listen,” Hussain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/migrants-face-discrimination-at-home-as-villagers-fear-corona-spread/story-w3fb1wUg44EHi50hTwroFL.html

08-05-2020||Lucknow||UP govt forms team to probe tiger’s death in PTR||The state government deputed a fact-finding team to probe into the death of a tiger at Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) even though the autopsy report confirmed the death due to traumatic injuries.Headed by principal chief conservator of forest (Project Tiger) PK Sharma forest and comprising senior IFS officer Ramesh Pandey and Kanpur zoo vet R K Singh as members, the team visited the site of the incident in Pilibhit on Wednesday and expected to submit its report within a week.“We will decide the line of action after the team submits its findings,” said principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Sunil Pandey. The five-year-old adult male tiger which had injured three villagers on Friday died 15 minutes after it was tranquillized at Jari village on Sunday evening.While forest officials claimed that the big cat died of earlier wounds, some wildlife activists suspected the death due to overdose of tranquillizers.The autopsy report by the centre for wildlife conservation, management and disease surveillance at Indian veterinary research institute (IVRI) has confirmed that the tiger’s death was caused by traumatic injuries in his thoracic cavity which caused excessive internal bleeding.The autopsy report also confirmed subcutaneous contusions and haemorrhage on the dorsum of his neck, shoulder and thoracic wall, which had superficial presence of maggots. In addition to many other internal injuries, the chambers of its heart had blood clots. The tiger’s toxicological report is awaited.“The injuries described in the autopsy clearly indicate that the tiger had been brutally beaten by humans and that the maggot wounds were at least 7-10 days old,” said B M Arora, president of Indian zoos and wildlife veterinarians.“We’ve inspected the spot and collected important information about the tiger’s death. Our focus is on finding how the tiger was victimised with brutal beating, and why PTR officials and their field force had failed to trace the injured tiger in the wild, or identify its assailants,” said PK Sharma, in-charge of the inquiry team.In response to whether the crippled tiger had overdosed on tranquillizers after two darts were injected into its body in quick succession, the officials said they will also examine the volume of tranquillizing substance used on the animal and whether it was excessive, given that it was injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-govt-forms-team-to-probe-tiger-s-death-in-ptr/story-q3RT6H8WKLKNB16aAPnnHK.html

The chief minister’s missive was in reply to Chaudhary’s letter to him earlier this week. In that letter, the leader of opposition had alleged that state government was not doing enough to tackle Covid-19 and related issues. “The government, officers, and all the people engaged in Covid-19 containment are dedicatedly working, but instead of words of encouragement, baseless allegations do not suit the circumstances. We need to be a constructive participant in the country’s endeavour to overcome the pandemic,” the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-outperformed-europe-in-tackling-covid-19-yogi/story-tUxkVzI2ezxyp9o2nXfLKL.html

All of them had decided to meet at Rupaidiha. Bahraich is one of the transit points in Uttar Pradesh for Nepalese to return home.In April end, Thapa had planned to visit his ailing mother in Nepal but due to the lockdown, he had to change his plan. He patiently waited till May 1 at his rented accommodation in Gomti Nagar, Lucknow, which he shared with four other non-Nepali migrants.But after it was clear that the lockdown will continue, he contacted his fellow Nepalese friends over the phone, who were also stuck all across Uttar Pradesh after the March 25 lockdown and decided to reach Rupaidiha and thereafter cross-over to Nepal. All of them left their respective places on May 2.Thapa managed to reach Rupaidiha hitchhiking on May 5. Two of his friends also managed to reach there.

08-05-2020||Lucknow||UP: Migrants’ return injects element of concern in Covid-19 scenario||The return of a large number of migrant workers to Uttar Pradesh from nearly a dozen states is emerging as a potential cause for concern about a spike in Covid-19 cases in the state.As the government is aware of the factor, it has put a screening and quarantine protocol in place. In all, 50,000 doctors, paramedics and associated screening staff are being mobilized to screen the incoming migrant workers.According to the data released on Thursday afternoon, 42,000 migrant workers have returned to Uttar Pradesh on 36 special trains so far. By the end of Thursday, 20 more trains will reach different districts of UP carrying another 24,000 migrants. According to the schedule for Friday, 51,600 more will reach the state on 43 trains in the next two days. By then, the total number of migrants to have returned will be a whopping 1,18,249 on 99 trains.THE NUMBERSSince March 24, nearly 7 lakh migrants workers have returned to the stateEver since the Shramik Special Trains started plying, 42,000 workers came back on 36 trains20 trains with 24,000 workers are scheduled to arrive on Thursday43 trains are scheduled to arrive on Friday with 51,600 workersBy Friday, total the figure would become 118249 passengers on 99 trains.50,000 doctors, paramedics, and other trained people deployed at 12,000 centres to check workersThe trains have reached Agra, Kanpur, Lucknow, Jaunpur, Gorakhpur, Bareilly, Ballia, Prayagraj, Pratapgarh, and Ghazipur.More are scheduled for these districts and Varanasi, Amethi, Sultanpur, Lakhimpur Kheri, Hardoi, Azamgarh, Barabanki, Sonbhadra, Gonda, Bahraich, Ambedkar Nagar and Fatehpur.The fear doesn’t seem to be unfounded as the Bundelkhand region that virtually was missing from the Covid-19 map till a week ago, is now showing an upward trend. Fifty-four coronavirus positive cases have been reported in the region and at least 15 of them are migrant workers.In Siddharthnagar, 10 migrants have tested positive at the government quarantine centres.While the migrants themselves are apprehensive of their health, residents of villages are opposing their re-entry, considering them to be ‘coronavirus carriers’. A state government spokesperson said since March 24, a total of seven lakh migrants had returned to Uttar Pradesh. The large numbers made the government change its original screening and quarantine protocol.The original order, issued by the revenue department, on April 25, had asked the district magistrates to quarantine all migrants at quarantine centres for 14 days. However, on May 1, the government modified the order.“According to the changed order, the incoming migrants have to be checked for symptoms at transit centres. Those with symptoms will be kept at quarantine centres. The others will be sent for 14-day home quarantine. We are also taking into account the time they have spent at the quarantine centres in the states that they have come from or will come from,” said Sanjay Goyal, relief commissioner, Uttar Pradesh.On Thursday, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath repeated the order and the instructions to the officers concerned. He said, “If they do not show any symptoms, send them for 14-day home quarantine with Rs 1000 allowance each.”Goyal explains, “There is no protocol to test each and every migrant coming in. Only those who show symptoms for Covid-19 will be tested. If the test is positive, they will be sent to the government’s quarantine or, if necessary, to medical quarantine. The rest are being sent home with a 14-day home quarantine advisory. The district administration will keep watch on them for 14 days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-migrants-return-injects-element-of-concern-in-covid-19-scenario/story-Rs2dB5Otk4scT6fpKS6EeM.html

08-05-2020||Lucknow||Ayushman Bharat likely to cover Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh||The Ayushman Bharat health scheme could soon include Covid-19 in the list of ailments for which insurance cover is to be provided. The State Agency for Comprehensive Health Insurance and Integrated Services (SACHIS) has made a proposal in this regard and the state cabinet has to take a call on it. If approved, the decision will impact the lives of 1,18,07,068 eligible families in the state. Anyone among them falling ill due to coronavirus can avail treatment at their hospitals of choice, listed by the health department for such patients. “The national health authority (NHA) has agreed to the idea. Now, the proposal is with the cabinet for a decision,” said Sangeeta Singh, CEO of SACHIS that monitors the Ayushman Bharat scheme in Uttar Pradesh. NHA is the national agency that monitors Ayushman Bharat scheme. Each Ayushman Bharat beneficiary family is entitled to a health insurance cover of ₹5 lakh per year. There are packages for treatment of different ailments with the empanelled hospitals. Hence, the beneficiary does not have to pay the hospital.Statistically, there has been a fall in the number of cases being done under the scheme in the state. The fall was recorded in the past two months. As per statistics available with SACHIS, the average daily cases that was earlier around 1500 per day has now come down to 400 cases per day. One reason for this fall is the closure of hospitals across the state during lockdown to contain coronavirus. The list of beneficiaries is ready. If a decision is taken, the same shall be communicated to the beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/ayushman-bharat-likely-to-cover-covid-19-in-uttar-pradesh/story-1g7Fi8BadnOEr6Lq1brleK.html

08-05-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Becoming, her biography||It’s not necessary that children follow their parents’ profession. Sardar Surjit Singh is a village farmer, and so is his only son. But his eldest child, a daughter, is a school principal. And his youngest, a daughter again, is a Chartered Accountant.And she lives in Gurugram.“But I have also done my share of farming in our small family khet (farming land),” says Navneet Kaur Virk. “I’ve fed the buffaloes, I’ve rooted out the weedy wild grass with the khurpi (trowel)...”Ms Virk’s last name happens to be the name of her village in Jalandhar, Punjab. This evening, she is speaking from the isolation of her flat in Gurugram’s Sector 93. It’s a house Ms Virk bought with her own savings — she moved into it in November last year. She has been in the city for a whole decade, but until then she would be living in PG accommodations “where hosts were nice enough, but tended to count the number of rotis one would be having for dinner.”You might think that for a 42-year-old career woman, enjoying an independent life in a two-bedroom flat in a modern metropolitan area is nothing out of the ordinary.Ms Virk doesn’t see it that way. These days, as the pandemic-ridden world is reeling under a prolonged lockdown, she finds time to look back on the journey that took her from village to city.She is the only member of her family to live in a metropolis. She is also the only one in her entire network of relatives to be single. “I took charge of my life from a very early age, and by now I have done many things by myself that I hadn’t thought I could do,” she says, breaking into a momentary laughter.The lady’s background gives a perspective to the distance she has travelled. Her mother, she says, cannot read or write. Her father studied till 7th standard. Her brother is a college drop out. “It was my studious behen (sister), Davinder, who kept me focused on the studies despite the household chores we were obliged to do everyday.”The three siblings would help their parents in the fields daily after returning from school. It was expected of every child in the village, she informs.Ms Virk’s school was 4 km away in the town of Phagwara. She would go walking, though in her early days her brother would take her on his bicycle. Years later, she was gifted her own bicycle by a cousin visiting from Birmingham, in the UK. Almost all her relatives—she points out—were distinguished by having at least one family member working in Canada or England. Hers was an exception.“We were so poor... the little bit of crop we would grow in our land was barely enough for our own needs.... only a tiny portion was left aside for sale in the mandi (wholesale market).”Following in her sister’s footsteps, Ms Virk stayed on course with her studies, eventually entering the college, where she graduated in commerce. She picked chartered accountancy after a casual discussion on the subject one day with a couple of friends.Being a CA student isn’t easy, Ms Virk explains. “It is notorious as a field where students tend to fail rather than pass.” For the next few years, she would commute daily to Phagwara town for her “articleship training” with a practising chartered accountant, a mandatory requirement for the certification course.Ideally, if a student clears all the exams in one go, it takes about four-and-a-half years to become a CA. Ms Virk accomplished it in seven years. The intervening setbacks rankled her family. “First, they were under social pressure to get me married. Then, it was puzzling to them that it should take me so long to get the certificate.” They couldn’t understand why was she wasting her time staying awake at the desk all night long.On January 17, 2007, the day she cleared the exams and finally became a CA, her brother gifted her ₹1000 “to party with friends.”That year proved to be a double milestone in Ms Virk’s biography. She left her village for Bengaluru after landing a job in the corporate world. One of the first things she was asked in the new office was to submit her passport for a work visit to Canada.”The Canada trip fell through, but Ms Virk’s company later sent her to California for eight weeks. By now, travelling abroad is no longer novel to her. She flies to UK almost every year for meetings with clients, she says.The lady shifted to the Delhi region in 2010, and is currently a senior manager in a multinational company.“As far as my materialistic dreams are concerned, I feel contented,” she declares. Haunted by the limited means of living while growing up, she was propelled by an urgent urge to become financially free. “Now I have the ability to buy things I desire without thinking much about the cost.”And then there’s the freedom of anonymity that a big city offers to its residents, including single women. “It doesn’t feel a bother to get out of the house... nobody here cares where I might be going, or if I am the one driving the car, or if I am with somebody else... this all is freedom.”At one point during the phone chat, Ms Virk steps out onto the terrace and shows the sun setting behind a row of tall buildings through the screen that connects her to this reporter.“Like most mothers, Mummy also believes that a kudi (girl) is settled only after she gets married.... but I feel that nobody ever gets settled in life.” Following a pause, she confesses that “one of the reasons I purchased this flat was to make Mummy feel secure about the fact that I have a place of my own and that I can take care of my life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-becoming-her-biography/story-kYzV1UcgcXpZaouFhgr6vJ.html
08-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt launches e-token system for liquor sale: How it works||To ensure social distancing and to stop overcrowding at liquor shops, the Delhi government on Thursday launched an e-token service with a time slot for people to buy alcohol at any nearby store.The Delhi government said in a statement that it took this decision to encourage people to avoid long queues by applying for an e-token.Here’s how the process works:• People can apply for an e-token through the link ‘https://www.qtoken.in/’• Users have to provide their name and phone number, following which the e-token will be sent to the phone• Tokens will be also be issued for those standing in queues, as per a Delhi government orderWhy it has been done?The e-token will help maintaining social distancing and cut down on waiting time in long queues by specifying time for each e-coupon holder to buy liquor at a shop.The people will require to furnish address of liquor shop in their area along with their mobile number and other details, while applying for e-token on the web link.However, the website for the token crashed within a few hours of its launch. A senior official attributed that to “high traffic within a limited time after announcement”. The link is still not working.Following the guidelines of the Central government, the Delhi government had given permission to open about 200 shops across the national capital from Monday onwards. However, due to overcrowding and long queues in some areas, only 50 shops could be kept open.Liquor shops would also start issuing coupons to people standing outside in queues, as per a government order, which also directed the deployment of marshals, to ensure social distancing, and use of more barricades, for area management.The additional tax of 70% on the maximum retail price of liquor would continue in Delhi.Delhi has 864 liquor shops, of which 475 are owned by government departments, ranging from tourism to industrial and infrastructure development. The other 389 are owned by private individuals and enterprises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-launches-e-token-system-for-liquor-sale-how-it-works/story-CyKGw9o6RoyCWhdVdtE5MK.html

It is completely treatable,” he said.He added all the big cats, who died, were from one small part of the park and may have got infected by consuming an animal.The other lions in the park died due to infighting, old age, drowning and snake bites. “We are conducting a thorough investigation and results will be submitted to the state government soon,” he said.The Jasadhar Animal Treatment Centre is currently treating 18 lions infected by Babesiosis.The officials said a combination of the viral and protozoan infections had killed around two dozen lions, after which Gujarat forest department imported canine distemper virus (CDV) vaccine from the US and vaccinated all lions in the Gir forest.24 lions had died in the same range of Gir National Park in September 2018 due to a combination of Babesiosis disease and canine distemper virus (CDV).An official said that babesia protozoa attacks the red blood cells in a lion’s body causing anaemia and makes it susceptible to other diseases like the CDV.“We are de-worming livestock of cattle main diet of Asiatic lions in eastern part of Gir. We are disinfecting their enclosures where ticks and mites could be there. We are also burning grass and hay around water holes,” said a Gujarat government official.The officer said antibiotics were being administered to the lions affected by babesiosis. “We have already managed to successfully treat six animals and there has not been any death due to the disease for almost a week now,” the officer said.He further added that a multi-pronged strategy has been adopted to contain the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/babesiosis-outbreak-in-gujarat-s-gir-causes-death-of-23-asiatic-lions/story-XFxTWegFXznC7o1pUxXBUJ.html

This caused the second train – Ludhiana-Gorakhpur Shramik Special – to depart 3.55 hours late at 5.55pm. It had 928 passengers.Sources in the railways confirmed that boarding for the Gorakhpur train started at 2pm, at its scheduled departure time.The third train for Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, with 1,188 passengers, was to leave at 8pm, but was also 90 minutes late. Around 100 migrants leaving on this train, were seen waiting for the pick-up bus near the Verka Milk Plant since 2pm. While some found shelter under the trees, other braved the sun with luggage on their heads for around four hours till the bus arrived at 6pm.The last train headed to Amethi, Uttar Pradesh, was planned to leave at 11pm.MEDICAL SCREENING VENUE CHANGEDA senior official in the district administration, requesting anonymity, said it was an unprecedented situation, so various departments were experimenting different protocols to ensure that maximum trains ran in a day.“On Wednesday night, it was decided to change the venue for medical screening from the Interstate Bus Terminus to Guru Nanak Stadium, as transporting passengers from pick-up points to the bus stand to the railway station was a time-consuming process,” he said.However, only five counters were set up at the stadium for medical screening, while the number of passengers was more than a 1,000. Noticing the rush, authorities eventually decided to increase the counters to 14.After screening, tickets were provided to the passengers, who then collected packaged food from a separate counter and walked towards the railway station, located a few metres away.‘PERSONNEL WORKING ROUND-THE-CLOCK’With the district administration announcing at least 12 trains a day from Friday, the work to transport passengers to medical screening to boarding them in the trains will continue round-the-clock.Different departments have deployed their staff in shifts of eight hours each to carry out the work smoothly.MC secretary Jasdev Sekhon said, “It takes at least two hours to screen passengers of one train, and if 12 trains are to run daily from Friday, this will have to be done all day and night.”“At least 600 police personnel are managing migrants at pick-up points, escorting them to buses and then to the screening centre, besides maintaining law and order,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, headquarters) Deepak Pareek, adding that they will be working in three shifts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shramik-special-trains-harrowing-time-for-migrants-as-trains-continue-to-run-late/story-Aj5frBsLVU5nJXJ5dedWuL.html
08-05-2020||City||Lack of awareness, confusion posing hurdles in migrants’ return home||Three days after railways started Shramik Special trains to transport migrants from Punjab to their home states amid the Covid-19 lockdown, lack of awareness and tech illiteracy continue to be pose hurdles in their return home.Nearly 6 lakh migrants from Ludhiana have registered on the Punjab helpline portal. Yet, several do not know how to apply and are consequently visiting the railway station directly to understand how to board a train.Cops have a hard time filtering out migrants without tickets when they approach the railway station with luggage.Among them are also those, who have got registered, but haven’t received a text message for date of boarding. Yet, they reach the railway station believing they can catch a train.KNOW THE PROCESSThe district administration has been shortlisting passengers from the applicants on the portal. The shortlisted passengers are sent two SMSes, one for confirmation of application and another sharing their date of travel.Only passengers receiving the second SMS need to report to their nearest pick-up point at the time mentioned in the message. From here, a bus will transport them to the Guru Nanak stadium for medical screening, and thereon, they have to walk to the railway station after collecting food from the stadium.Dani Ram, 43, who hails from Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, accompanied his neighbours, who had received the text messages.“I had also registered to return home and received a confirmation message. But, I have not received the pick-up message, while my neighbours have got them and were taken to the stadium in a bus,” he said.On their part, deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal and commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal have shared video messages, explaining the process to board the trains.In the videos, the officials have urged the passengers not to approach the railway station directly. “Even if 2,500 people have registered for a destination, a train can transport only around 1200 passengers. So, messages are sent on first-come, first-serve basis,” the DC said.TICKETS TO WRONG DESTINATIONSThere are also incidents where migrants have received tickets for the wrong destination.Vaseem Ansari, 33, who wants to travel to Moradabad, said he got a ticket for Bareilly, which he realised only after receiving the train ticket on the bus while going to the railway station. Ansari said he did not know how to apply on the portal, and took somebody’s help. “They must have entered the wrong destination. Now, I will have to apply again and wait for my turn,” he said, adding that several migrants were facing troubles using the mobile application for the portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lack-of-awareness-confusion-posing-hurdles-in-migrants-return-home/story-4hMUFtg05OOt9mKMv6x61J.html

Some organisations in Bhiwandi have now stepped ahead to help such labourers with food in a bid to make them stay in the city and not risk their lives.One such organisation, Shree Bhairav Seva Samiti, has been serving food, medicines, footwear, masks and caps to migrant labourers. “We have also made a provision of around 1,000-litre capacity potable water tanker. We make them understand the importance of staying at home and that by traveling on foot they are putting their families’ health at stake. We offer details of shelter homes around so that they are able to manage food during the lockdown,” said Anil Bhairav, chairman, Shree Bhairav Seva Samiti.Volunteers from Rajnoli, Vashind, Atgaon, Bhatsa and along the Mumbai-Agra highway have been helping the organisations in Bhiwandi. “We have put up posters and our volunteers reach out to the migrants who are traveling with their baggage. We explain to them about the impact of the virus and assure them that help will be provided if they stay back,” said Shahid Ansari, member of another social organisation, Alpha Group.Despite help pouring in, migrant labourers continue to remain anxious. “We have been patiently waiting for the past one month to go homes. Now we have no money and no means to earn it either due to the lockdown. To feed ourselves and our families, we are left with no option but to go back home and engage in agriculture. We may take many days to reach our homes but we will feel secure there,” said Rajendra Yadav, 43, who works in a powerloom. He has decided to walk back to his hometown in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-organisations-step-forward-to-help-stranded-migrants/story-JIyNAKgzzXM8XQctVQfqnM.html

Among the students who returned, eight girls and 14 boys have been housed in separate rooms at Parker House, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), so they do not come in direct contact with their family members and others.One of the students, Ashish Rana, said, “Earlier, I used to spend most of my time studying, but as I have a lot of extra time nowadays, I read Bhagavad Gita to be at peace with myself.” He appealed to other people staying in isolation centres to spend their time in productive activities and remain positive.Another student Shruti, who is preparing for the Joint Entrance Examination, said, “I am utilising this 21-day quarantine time to prepare for the entrance examination.

08-05-2020||City||Demanding compensation for losses, contractors keep liquor vends shut in Ludhiana||Allowed to reopen shops from Thursday, wine contractors in the district decided to keep their liquor vends closed. Reason: They are demanding compensation for the losses incurred in the last financial year and review of the 2020-21 Excise Policy , including withdrawal of quota condition. In Ludhiana, there are around 750 liquor vends in 150 groups, including those at Khanna, Samrala, Jagraon among others, which remained shut on Thursday. The government earns an annual revenue of around ₹ 1,100 crore from these liquor vends, which amounts to over ₹3 crore per day.Meanwhile, anticipating low sales owing to the movement of migrant labourers out of the district, the contractors have also raised questions on home delivery of liquor allowed by the state government. They said it was not possible for the vendors to supply alcohol under the limits imposed by the government. In this regard, a cabinet meeting on Friday has been scheduled by the state government to look into the demands of the contractors.Working on the directions issued by the state government, the administration had on Wednesday allowed the wine contractors to open the vends from Thursday. While counters sales are allowed from 9am to 3pm, home delivery can be done till 6pm.Further, demanding the withdrawal of quota system, one of the wine contractors, Neeraj, said, regular sales cannot be expected during the Covid-19 crisis. “With labourers moving out and a major section of residents struggling to cater to their daily needs, it is difficult for contractors to even recover the fee that has to be paid to the government,” he added.Another contractor requesting anonymity said the government was only allowing the vends to open for revenue. “Nothing is being done to provide relief to the wine contractors who have also suffered major losses due to imposition of curfew in the last week of March,” he said. He demanded that the proportionate quota of the loss owing to curfew during the last financial year be reduced and proportionate licence fee be waived. He also claimed that the government’s decision to commence home delivery of liquor will not bear fruit as only 2 litre of liquor can be delivered per household. “We do not have the required work force and the residents are also suspicious over supplies being done by delivery boys as they fear it might be infected with the virus,” he said.Deputy excise and taxation commissioner (DETC) Pawan Garg said, “The state government has to take the decision on policy matter and compensation to be given to the vendors. It is expected to take a final decision in the cabinet meeting expected on May 8.”“However, the department has asked the contractors to open the vends from Friday,” he added. YAD OPENS ‘DOODH DA THEKA’ TO OPPOSE GOVT’S MOVE Youth Akali Dal (YAD) district president Gurdeep Singh Gosha chose a novel way to protest against the government’s decision to reopen liquor vends. Holding cannisters with “doodh da theka” written over them, the YAD leader sat in front of a liquor vend opposite the city railway station and began distributing milk. Gosha said, “The government’s decision is ironical as it has allowed the liquor vends to operate while the gurdwaras and temples remain closed.” He said the government was only eyeing revenue with no value for human life, adding that the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) will continue to oppose the move. Long queues of people, including those homeless, migrants and beggars, emerged as soon as Gosha began to sell milk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/demanding-compensation-for-losses-contractors-keep-liquor-vends-shut-in-ludhiana/story-ciirmoW95KzQVXOQxTCz0J.html

08-05-2020||Mumbai||Experts to meet Maharashtra CM to discuss how transportation can open up||While the city remains under lockdown, a citizens’ group is collating mobility solutions that may be put in place when the city starts opening up. Mumbai Mobility Forum is crowd-sourcing ideas for how public transport in the city may function in a way that congestion is reduced and distancing norms are maintained. The group plans to present their ideas to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray soon. Experts associated with Mumbai Mobility Forum have already collated some short, medium and long-term solutions for the city. Pranav Naik from the Mumbai Mobility Forum described the initiative as crowd-sourced and with inputs from experts who can help authorities implement the solutions. Among the short-term solutions are marking seats in buses, donation drives for cycles and pop-up lanes for bicycles as short-term solutions. Medium-term suggestions include increasing the number of buses, bus-routes, train services and new Metro lines. Long-term solutions look at integration of all modes of transport, congestion charges and a smart bus network. Naik said, “The goal is to effect long-term behavioural change towards sustainable modes of transport and wean a bulk of the population away from private transport as well as improve the quality of life for Mumbaikars.”Adhering to physical distancing norms in Mumbai’s suburban trains and buses is a huge challenge since these are overcrowded on any given day. Physical distancing requires people to maintain a distance of at least six feet from one another. The train network ferries 7.5 million passengers daily while buses help 5 million people transit over more than 400 routes. The city’s bicycle mayor Firoza Suresh, who is also a part of Mumbai Mobility Forum’s initiative, suggested promoting cycling as a means of transport. “Cycling is an inherently physically-distanced mode of transport. In Mumbai too, this is the right time to bring up the behaviour change,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/experts-to-meet-maharashtra-cm-to-discuss-how-transportation-can-open-up/story-swjeiJQLI18rzTNRCFBrAM.html
08-05-2020||City||Migrant workers stranded in Navi Mumbai as police refuse to accept forms||The Panvel city police on Thursday refused to accept new forms from migrant workers, leaving hundreds of workers confused and stranded. “Several people have gathered across police stations to go back home but the Uttar Pradesh government has still not given consent for trains from Maharashtra to enter the state,” said Ashok Dudhe, deputy commissioner of police, zone 2. The police also claimed that there is no confirmation from the West Bengal and Bihar governments also, owing to which the police cannot accept new forms for migrants to return.Several workers waited outside Panvel police station for two hours only to be sent to the municipal corporation office.Satyendra Saha, 46, is a native of Bihar, employed at a steel plant in Pen. To return home, he underwent a medical test but after walking through the night for more than eight hours from Pen, he was told by Panvel police that there are no trains to Bihar.“The police are threatening to hit us. What do we do? We got the medical test done and have been running around for the last two days. We will die like this even before contracting coronavirus,” said Saha.Even at the corporation office, their forms were not accepted.“The civic officials sent us back to the police. They are making us run from pillar to post and not telling us clearly what we need to do,” said Manju Roy, who is struggling to get a form to go to Kolkata.Meanwhile, the police has green-flagged the journey of migrants from Odisha. “On Friday, a train to Odisha will depart with 1,200 passengers for which migrants can submit forms,” said Dudhe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrant-workers-stranded-in-navi-mumbai-as-police-refuse-to-accept-forms/story-yflIQ3nKQv1cGeYlTbv5rO.html
08-05-2020||City||Maharashtra government: Medical certificates not needed, migrants will be screened||In a relief for lakhs of migrants stranded in the state who are waiting to return to their home states, the Maharashtra government on Thursday issued a clarification that there is no need to attach a medical certificate to the registration form required to facilitate the journey.In an order signed by chief secretary Ajoy Mehta, the state amended an earlier order which made it mandatory for migrant workers to submit a fitness certificate from a registered medical practitioner with their registration forms.The decision was taken in the wake of the long queues outside private practitioners’ offices, diluting social distancing measures and after the migrants complained that some doctors were overcharging them for the medical certificate.The new order stated that migrants/stranded persons who wish to return to their home states should be screened at the time of starting the journey with a digital thermometer and symptomatic examination free of cost must be conducted by the state or civic officials. Corporations can also hire registered medical practitioners for the exercise, the order said. A single-list of all passengers, indicating that they have been screened and found to be not displaying any influenza-like illness (ILI), be issued by the medical person-in-charge, stated the directive.State minister Chhagan Bhujbal said contradictory orders by the state created confusion and panic among migrants. Speaking to a regional news channel, Bhujbal said that several migrants stuck in the state want to return home but are confused due to unclear orders. He added that he took up the issue during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.“The migrants are confused if they should go home or to the doctor first. So the ones who have the authority to issue orders, should do so immediately quickly. The notifications that are coming now are creating confusion,” he said. He also pointed out that migrants were seen on the Mumbai-Agra highway, walking back to their home states. “Such scenes are heart-rending and they are unfitting for a state such as ours… There is no physical distancing maintained when they walk. They enter villages; drink water there and eat there. Instead, they should be ferried back to their villages in one go,” he said.Meanwhile, Sion police sent 36 daily wage workers from Rajasthan back to their native homes in two buses on Wednesday evening, Lalita Gaikwad, senior inspector of Sion police station said. The police had arranged for biscuits, water and fruits for the migrants’ journey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-government-medical-certificates-not-needed-migrants-will-be-screened/story-uxj4vBXLfz7nmQpbSpMBCO.html

The charitable hospital has the capacity to quarantine 150 patients.“The GMCH is running out of beds some of which have been reserved to treat serious Covid-19 patients who may need emergency shifting from other hospitals from in and around Amritsar. The government has acquired 150-bedded SGRD Charitable Hospital and is paying the expenses. The asymptomatic and stable patients are now being treated there ,” said Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Jugal Kishore.“We can admit Covid-19 patients to our full capacity as we have enough resources, including ventilators, for providing treatment,” said GMCH principal Dr Sujata Sharma. “Fifty seven Covid-19 patients are admitted to SGRD Charitable Hospital. The patients are getting treatment from specialist doctors and are stable. The hospital has been converted into a full-fledged Covid facility in the wake of the rising number of cases. We have 10 ventilators which can be used for Covid-19 patients in case of emergency. The patients suffering from other disease instead of Covid-19 have been shifted to SGRD, Vallah,” said Dr AP Singh, dean, Sri Guru Ram Das University of Health Sciences.“Besides, the School for Meritorious Students, Amritsar, has also been converted into a Covid facility with the capacity of 1,000 beds which are kept for asymptomatic and stable patients. In case of emergency also, patients can be admitted to the facility as doctors and adequate nurses would be appointed.”The district has witnessed a hike of 1,857% in Covid-19 cases in just a week with its tally jumping to 274 cases till Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gmch-amritsar-jam-packed-new-patients-being-admitted-to-charitable-hospital/story-ETuwARDa09PV1i6XvPCfgM.html
08-05-2020||Chandigarh||ASHAs in Haryana fighting battle against coronavirus without armour||They are among the frontline corona warriors, yet numerous representations by Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) in Haryana for the very basic safety equipment such as masks, gloves, head-gears and sanitisers seem to have fallen on deaf ears of health authorities to this day. Result: Two such workers have already contracted the coronavirus and many more are at risk due to the nature of their duties involving exposure to a large number of people, including potential virus carriers.There are about 19,000 ASHAs in the state, most of whom are engaged in tasks such as conducting health surveys of every household in the areas assigned to them, besides routine vaccinations and health-related works in all 22 districts of Haryana. “All these health activists have been working hard since mid-March and repeatedly asking, verbally and in written representations, that they need the basic safety gears like masks, gloves and sanitizers, besides a smartphone as they have now been asked to update all activities online. They come from humble backgrounds and cannot afford high-end cell phones. We have again written to the health authorities, after another ASHA tested positive in Ambala after the first such case in Jind,” said Surekha, general secretary of the ASHA workers’ association. In Ambala, these workers were assigned duties in different areas to check foreign-returnees and ensure that they were quarantined. In the second round, they were allotted duties to check residents with flu-like symptoms and refer their case to seniors; samples were taken accordingly. An ASHA tested positive on May 4 and was initially shifted to a designated hospital in Mullana and later to the civil hospital, which did not have adequate facilities. “Around 10% of us have received masks, but the remaining ones have to buy on their own. If the frontline health workers are at risk, how could they help in this war against pandemic?” asked a leader of these workers.In Jind, four Anganwadi workers, who had conducted door-to-door surveys without wearing proper safety gears, had tested positive for Covid-19 earlier last month. A senior official of the Jind child development project wing, who did not want to be named, agreed that not all health workers were provided with the safety gears. In Hisar and Sirsa too, the situation is not different, despite the fact that health workers have to enter the containment and buffer zones and interact with people there. Though masks are not a big issue as we can use our scarves or dupattas as alternative, most of us have neither been getting sanitisers, nor gloves or head gears regularly, several health workers claimed. Same concern has come to the fore from Karnal as well, where ASHAs have been assigned to prepare reports of people coming from other states. They need proper protection as they meet unknown people every day and yet, complaints of inadequate and erratic supply of protective gears are in abundance. ‘WILL ENSURE GAP ARE PLUGGED QUICKLY’When contacted, Haryana health minister Anil Vij, who lauded the contribution of these accredited health activists in fighting the pandemic, said there were clear instructions that all of them would get personal safety gears as per their duty requirements. “Yet, I will ensure that the gaps, if any, in the availability of said safety gears, are immediately plugged,” he added.

08-05-2020||Chandigarh||100 commercial units closed in Chandigarh’s industrial area||The UT administration on Thursday shut down around 100 commercial establishments, other than industrial units, in the industrial area of Phases 1 and 2.A team led by director industries Harjit Singh Sandhu, accompanied by the police, closed down hardware shops, iron sheet traders, electronic goods warehouses and electronic shops. Sheds of scrap dealers were also closed down.Sandhu said, “As per the guidelines issued by the Union home ministry on May 1 regarding the opening of industrial units in a red zone outside the containment zones, these shops cannot be allowed to remain open in an industrial area.”Only industrial units are allowed to remain open in an industrial estate, with strict access control, added Sandhu.City BJP industrial cell convener Avi Bhasin, who intervened on behalf of the commercial establishments, said, “All shops that have been closed are service providers to the industrialists. These are purely business to business establishments and not retail outlets. Without their services, industries cannot function. This is a clear case miscommunication and misinterpretation of the MHA guidelines.”City BJP chief Arun Sood took up the issue with the UT administration and said that hopefully a solution will soon be found.ACCESS CONTROLMeanwhile, local industrialists complained that even though the administration had designated six access points for the two industrial areas, no screening was being done of the people entering inside. There are three access points each for industrial phases 1 and 2.Industrialists expressed particular concern about the people coming from sectors and colonies, parts of which have been notified as containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/100-commercial-units-closed-in-chandigarh-s-industrial-area/story-0ojtqWMQWLth6gt3O3lXcP.html

08-05-2020||Chandigarh||Anticipatory bail plea of rape accused dismissed in Chandigarh||A district court has dismissed the anticipatory bail application of a private school teacher who is an accused in a rape case.The case dates back to March 2, 2020, when an FIR was registered against accused Anil Sharma of Khuda Ali Sher, Chandigarh. The complainant had told the police that in 2017, he used to send his children to learn skating from Sharma, and the two families became friends. In December 2019, he came to know that his wife had undergone an abortion and was depressed, he said.The complainant said that his wife revealed that Sharma had “forcibly made physical relations with her and even started blackmailing and threatening her.” He alleged that the accused had physically and mentally harassed his wife.The complainant mentioned in the FIR that when he confronted Sharma, he cut the call and fled to another city. “In January, he came back and when we tried to contact him, his wife threatened us,” the complainant said, adding that his wife was in depression after the episode.He demanded legal action against Sharma for “spoiling his wife’s life”.Counsel for the complainant argued: “The accused is a physical education teacher and the victim’s children were studying in the same school. The accused pressurised and blackmailed the victim and repeatedly raped her, and even threatened to spoil the career of her kids.”Following the arguments, anticipatory bail was denied to the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/anticipatory-bail-plea-of-rape-accused-dismissed-in-chandigarh/story-0ychF75a5hFc9PoUGXTCEP.html
08-05-2020||Chandigarh||Paswan rakes up slow distribution of free foodgrains, Capt rejects claims||Union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution Ram Vilas Paswan on Thursday called the Punjab government out for tardy distribution of foodgrains to 1.41-crore beneficiaries in the state under the Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY).“Punjab was allocated 70,725 tonnes of foodgrains for April under PMGKAY but the state government distributed 688 tonnes which is merely 1% of the total allocation,” Paswan tweeted, urging Amarinder to expedite the distribution of free foodgrains in his state. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had on March 26 announced the free supply of 5kg of wheat or rice per person per month and 1kg of preferred pulses every month for three months to deal with the economic impact of the lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.Though Paswan also gave similar details of progress made by several other states in separate tweets on the social networking service, his comments on Punjab triggered a war of words between Union food processing industries minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and chief minister Amarinder Singh. Retweeting Paswan’s comment, Harsimrat asked Amarinder to get his act together and ensure people do not continue to suffer for want of ration. “Please start central ration distribution immediately,” she wrote.Rejecting the Centre’s claims on food supplies to Punjab, the CM accused Harsimrat of misleading the Union food minister. He denied any delay in distribution of free foodgrains received from the Centre, saying the state had received less than 50% of the promised dal (pulses) in the absence of which the wheat grains also could not be distributed.Amarinder said as per the Centre’s own directives, wheat and dal had to be distributed to the eligible beneficiaries during the lockdown/curfew, but pulses were not forthcoming from the central government. Contrary to what Harsimrat had been claiming, the fact was that Punjab had received only about 2,500 MT of the promised 10,800 MT of dal by May 1, he said, adding that the state started distribution with this initial quantity of dal and wheat on May 1 itself, and distribution was currently in progress in 18 districts. He further said the state government had already spent from its own budget to distribute 15 lakh food packets, with each containing 10kg wheat, 2kg Dal and 2kg sugar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/paswan-rakes-up-slow-distribution-of-free-foodgrains-capt-rejects-claims/story-OX8VWfueBesVQGcIFIATPP.html

The sarpanch and his supporters have alleged that they caught two drug smugglers but police are ‘protecting them’. Police said sarpanch Harbhajan Singh came in contact of a Covid-19 patient and was quarantined along with some others at a government primary school but they violated quarantine. “A resident caught two women carrying drugs in his fields. The sarpanch and others questioned the women when they were passing by the school road. Locals found some capsules from the women’s bags after which one of the women misbehaved with the sarpanch. However, police did not act against the women and booked the sarpanch instead,” said Chamkour Singh, a Khanpur resident.“The accused were identified as sarpanch Harbhajan Singh, Satvir Singh, Jyoti and Bimla, all from Khanpur,” police said. Senior superintendent of police Sandeep Garg said that they have started investigation and assured fair inquiry into the matter. A case was registered for violation of quarantine.

The state government has already suspended a few police personnel and officers for their inept handling of the incident, wherein three people were murdered by a mob of tribals during the nationwide lockdown. Deshmukh, on Thursday, visited Gadchinchale village in Dahanu tehsil of Palghar district where the lynching took place. He was accompanied by director general of police (DGP) Subodh Kumar Jaiswal and met local political representatives including MP, MLA and members of gram panchayat. Local political leaders reportedly complained to the minister that the police did not take adequate steps to mitigate the rumours which led to the killings.Deshmukh, in a video message on Thursday, said, “After visiting the village and meeting the elected representatives, we have taken the decision of sending the Palghar SP on compulsory leave. The charge of the post has been given to the additional superintendent of police of Palghar.” On April 16, three men – two seers and their driver – were dragged out of their vehicle outside Gadchinchale village, around 110km from Palghar, and were beaten to death by a mob on suspicion that they were child-lifters. The incident occurred when the victims were going from Mumbai to Surat to attend a funeral.The deceased were identified as Kalpavriksha Giri, 70; Sushil Giri, 35; and their driver Nilesh Telgade, 30. The seers belonged to Varanasi-based Juna Akhara and were slated to attend the last rites of their guru Mahant Shri Ram Giri in Surat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/palghar-lynching-case-sp-sent-on-compulsory-leave/story-D5mQNNW6MpB5V61WeR1wUN.html

But this isn’t just about me, it’s not just about one individual case, or even one employer. Care workers across the country are being easily exploited by their employers, especially if they’re on zero-hours contracts,” said the 24-year-old Labour Party MP, who had pledged to donate the salary from her part-time role at the retirement home run by ExtraCare to a local Covid-19 support fund.“If you are one of the care workers who has been pressured or threatened with disciplinary action for speaking out about the lack of PPE, then I’d like you to contact my office, in confidence, to share your experience. It’s really important that we get a picture of the scale of this happening across the country,” she said, in her appeal to care workers.Her employer ExtraCare said in a statement that the reason for Whittome’s contract being terminated was that they no longer required extra staff and also that there were no problems with PPE at the Lark Hill retirement village where she had been based.“Nadia joined us as a casual worker to help our care team and we welcomed her contribution, providing support on eight care shifts during March and April. Our in-house care team is now fulfilling our needs at this time and Nadia’s help is no longer needed,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-origin-uk-mp-sacked-as-care-worker-on-covid-19-frontline/story-gwY95zINovTcjRULgG847H.html

08-05-2020||City||Despite work offers, migrant labourers desperate to go home||Even as industrial units are becoming operational with easing of lockdown restrictions in Punjab, migrant labourers are desperate to go back home due to concern for their families, fear of Covid-19 infection and uncertainty over their future.Kailash Kumar, 40, an industrial worker of Jalandhar who hails from Bahraich (Uttar Pradesh), said, “We are concerned about our families back home and want to leave as soon as possible.” Kailash said he and several of his co-workers are waiting for the confirmation of their train bookings.Nearly one lakh migrants, majority of them factory workers, have registered with the district administration to go back to their home states on special trains. Seven ‘Shramik Express’ trains have already departed from the city to different states, ferrying around 8,400 migrant labourers since May 5. Manoj Kumar, 29, hailing from Bihar, who worked in a dyeing factory in Jalandhar, said there is an uncertainty about their future. “Even if the factory resumes operations, we will be working under the fear of virus infection. We will rather go back home and live with our families.”Gagan Kumar of Bihar, a construction worker in Nabha subdivision of Patiala, says his mother has been facing health problems back home. “My contractor is calling for construction work now. However, I want rush home. We don’t know when will get the next chance to return home.”Sunil Mandal, another migrant labourer from Bihar, said, “We have had a tough time during the lockdown period so far. Though we have work opportunities now, my family is worried and insisting me to return home.” So far, over 35,000 migrant labourers have registered for their return in Patiala district.Narinder Singh Saggu, president of focal point industrial units association, said the government should have consultations with industrialists so that the workers’ apprehensions could be resolved.Onkar Singh Agaul, state general secretary of BKU (Rajewal), said, “The government should have made all possible efforts to keep back migrant labourers in Punjab to revive the economy of the state and save paddy growers from the farm labour crisis.”Meanwhile, as many as 1,188 migrant labourers left for Gonda (Uttar Pradesh) from Amritsar on a Shramik Express train on Thursday. Deputy commissioner Shivdular Singh Dhillon said proper screening of passengers was carried out by health workers before they boarded the train.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/despite-work-offers-migrant-labourers-desperate-to-go-home/story-KX9ZWOsBoHR1PfarRKdSCM.html

But, by the time he reached Khanna, he felt weary and realised that he won’t be able to make it to his native village.”The boy’s father, who is a labourer, said once the boy came to know that the government had arranged trains and buses for migrant labourers, he had started pressuring him and his wife to leave for their native village. But they were not ready to go, so he left on his own, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/teen-leaves-for-up-on-foot-khanna-police-hand-him-over-to-parents/story-DFUuUGIw1GYkErFDbDkVAI.html

He also urged the PM to give directions to ministries in this regard in order to enable states to formulate clear strategies and path, post lockdown 3.0. The CM said this was necessary as Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdowns had led to unprecedented losses of jobs, businesses, and economic opportunities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/captain-amarinder-singh-writes-to-modi-seeks-exit-strategy-from-lockdown/story-QkyzDYjcNCRgyZsTtP1b4H.html

Shopping malls, cloth stores and other shops are closed. Why are liquor sales being prioritised? The move will also cause an increase in cases of domestic violence,” he said, during a media interaction at the Akal Takht Secretariat.“All temples, mosques and gurdwaras have been closed by the government. Where will people go to express their devotion? People’s devotion acts like an immunity booster and is key in the fight against Covid-19,”he said. TREAT COVID-19 PATIENTS RESPECTFULLY He condemned the vilification of Nanded pilgrims who tested positive for Covid-19. “Those infected are victims not criminals and they should be treated respectfully. Strict action should be taken against those who utter derogatory remarks against them,” the jathedar said.“First, attempts were made to target the sangat, which had gathered at Sri Anandpur Sahib during the Holla Mohalla festival after Baldev Singh of Nawanshahr tested positive for Covid-19. Then, our NRI brothers from Punjab were targeted. Now, the pilgrims who returned from Takht Hazur Sahib, Nanded, are being vilified, which is condemnable”, said Giani Harpreet Singh.‘ONLY PILGRIMS BEING BLAMED’ The jathedar said, “Punjabi workers from Maharashtra had also joined pilgrims at Nanded to avail the transport facility provided to them. They took shelter at the gurdwara there, which was not wrong, but, only the pilgrims are being defamed.”“This vilification drive against pilgrims will not be tolerated at any cost. No person, who tests positive for the coronavirus, should be treated like a criminal.”On quarantining Nanded-returnees in congregation halls of Dera Radha Soami, the Akal Takht jathedar said, “There are no accommodation arrangements at deras. These deras have only sheds not rooms and rapidly heat up during the day, but pilgrims are forced to live in them. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has appealed the government to shift them to gurdwara serais, which have rooms, but the government seems adamant on keeping them at deras.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/opening-liquor-vends-ridiculous-akal-takht-jathedar/story-P11Q2EqSr7UwaRScABrERM.html

A senior government official familiar with the development said the sugarcane harvesting was in the last phase. “Earlier, the management of the Shahbad sugar mill had made a pact with two private mills in Yamunanagar and Karnal’s Bhadson for the procurement of the remaining produce,” he added. Saraswati Sugarmill of Yamunanagar has agreed to crush 3 lakh quintals of sugarcane of farmers associated with the Shahbad mill, but the management of Bhadson mill later refused to do so. Now, the remaining produce has been allocated to the cooperative sugar mill in Kaithal. The development has left the farmers worried as it will increase their transportation cost and the government is yet to announce any financial assistance. “The development has delayed the harvesting as it will not only affect the yield, but also put extra burden on us as we would have to travel 85km extra to sell our produce in Yamunanagar,” said Krishan Kumar, a farmer from Deeg village in Kurukshetra. Another farmer, Gaurav, from Yara village said, “My 400 quintals of sugarcane are yet to be harvested and I am waiting for the sugar mill to send me indents to purchase my produce.” Managing director of Shahbad Cooperative Sugar Mill Sushil Kumar said, “We have made arrangements for the remaining 6 lakh quintals of sugarcane with the nearby mills. But, as of now, there is no discussion to compensate the farmers for selling their produce to other mills,” he added. The private sugar mill in Yamunanagar has crushing capacity of around 1 lakh quintal per day and it could crush the entire produce by May 15. But, the farmers who have been told to sell their produce to Kaithal cooperative mill might face problems as the mill’s capacity is around 25,000 quintals per day and it will take several more days to crush the crop allocated to the mill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kurukshetra-cane-growers-in-a-fix-as-shahbad-sugar-mill-stops-ops/story-4HNj91nbLwTc2qa6IkHG4N.html
08-05-2020||City||PAU cautions farmers against desert locust attack in Punjab||Agri scientists at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) have cautioned farmers against a possible desert locust attack in the border areas of Punjab and Rajasthan. The advisory has been issued after locust sightings in Fazilka, and considering the heat-driven continuous breeding activity of locusts in the Middle East and Pakistan.Entomology department head PK Chhuneja said in the last couple of weeks, small groups of hoppers (wingless nymphs) had been witnessed in some areas of Rajasthan and Punjab. “These locusts are sneaking into India from Pakistan. They are likely to arrive in swarms and damage the vegetation in the border areas of Rajasthan and Punjab,” he said.Chhuneja added that swarms of locusts invaded India during monsoon. But they appeared in January and February this year due to climatic changes.He added that if farmers observed any activity of hoppers or flying locusts, they must immediately inform PAU or the Punjab agriculture department to suppress their invasion. “The hoppers, which move by jumping, can be crushed under wide-wheel vehicles. The flying locusts can be scared away by creating loud drumming sounds or by using torches,” the PAU advisory read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pau-cautions-farmers-against-desert-locust-attack-in-punjab/story-LrnlPCqV7EjEOPlO6z3o6J.html

08-05-2020||Mumbai||Around 4K objections against draft EIA rules filed from Maharashtra||Alleging that the Centre was diluting environment protection laws to allow construction in ecologically important areas, citizens and environment groups have filed 3,971 objections against the draft environment impact assessment (EIA) notification, 2020 proposed by the Union environment ministry. On March 12, the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) presented the new rules that will replace the 2006 EIA notification, which is presently in force, in their attempt to make the existing norms ‘more transparent and expedient’ in issuing environment clearances for development projects. The government defended the changes saying the idea is to introduce procedures to bring violations, for example work done without prior environment clearance leading to ecological damage, under regulations at the earliest in the interest of environment safety. “EIA 2020 has been envisaged to uncover all loopholes that were left unchecked in previous norms, and ensure a complete balance between development and conservation,” said a senior MoEFCC official.The draft was published as an official gazette on March 23, a day before the nationwide lockdown. It has allowed suggestions and objections to be filed within a period of 60 days which ends on May 21. However, the ministry on Thursday announced an extension of the deadline till June 30.Environmental collective Let India Breathe, which is campaigning against the changes in law, said the lockdown has restricted their dissent. “We hope to democratise it (the notification) through our objections,” said Yash Marwah, a member of the collective. “The state’s failure to hold the notification for a little longer makes us wonder whether there is a larger picture we are missing.”Environmental groups say the new rules are a watered down version of the 2006 norms, but with provisions to protect industries rather than the environment as it does away with public consultations before granting clearances.Projects like highway expansions have been exempted from getting prior clearance, said members from Jhatkaa.org, a Bengaluru-based advocacy organisation. “This is being done even though there is clear evidence of the threat of fragmentation of wildlife habitats and the emergence of zoonotic diseases like Covid-19,” said Meghna Amin, a campaigner the organisation, and called for the notification to be scrapped in its entirety. “From excluding new industries from the list which requires environmental clearance, to reducing number of public consultations, the draft norms mainly look to serve the business community. Fewer public consultations mean a lesser chance for local, vulnerable communities to voice their opinions.” Environment groups say the new rules exclude industries such as electronic waste management, large-scale renewable energy projects, and geo-engineering technologies from its purview. Projects that promote continued fossil fuel dependence, such as coalbed methane extraction, onshore or offshore oil and gas drilling etc., are exempted in the draft rules.“This notification runs totally opposite to the solid environmental jurisprudence developed by courts in this country,” said Zaman Ali, an environment lawyer. “Going against an order by the Supreme Court, the draft norms allow post-facto environment clearance (approval after a project has begun) wherein violators can pay and have their violations condoned. This does not create deterrence. ‘Polluter pays’ changes to ‘pollute and pay’.”Ali explained how, according to the draft rules, projects, including those proposed by polluting industries such as operations for soda ash, chemical fertilisers, ammonia, acids, pesticides, fiber, petroleum and petrochemical products, dyes, synthetics, paints, are exempted from public consultation if the factories are located inside a ‘notified industrial estate’. “All building and construction projects are now off the peril of public consultation too,” he said.Mumbai-based environment group Vanashakti, which raised objections to the changes, highlighted that if the draft is finalised it will cause permanent damage to the landscape. The group has raised concerns about relaxation in rules about land levelling, land acquisition, mining and transportation of materials. “The need of the hour, considering climate change, water crisis, outbreaks of zoonotic virus pandemics, is to strengthen the existing legislation; not dilute it further,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti. “What’s worse is that due to the prevailing lockdown most of the country is at standstill and residents are not be able to file their objections on time.”The MoEFCC official said all objections will be considered by a panel constituted specifically to assess issues raised by citizens. “We have received some letters. We will study them after the final deadline,” he said.HOW TO SEND YOUR RESPONSESObjections or suggestions on the draft notification can be sent in writing to the secretary, MoEFCC, Indira Paryavaran Bhawan, Jor Bagh Road, Aliganj, New Delhi 110003, or by e-mail to eia2020-moefcc@gov.in||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/around-4k-objections-against-draft-eia-rules-filed-from-maharashtra/story-dA1vUTfV0Bs0UeWJ1hfYTI.html

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Sambhaji Raje on Thursday sought a public apology from Fadnavis for hurting sentiments of the followers of late Shahu Maharaj. He tweeted, “Former CM Devendra Fadnavis must apologise to all Shiv-Shahu devotees. He has hurt sentiments of all Shiv-Shahu devotees including myself in the state.”Fadnavis said, “I had asked my office to make the change in the tweet when I learned about the earlier mistake. The thought of disrespecting him (Shahu Maharaj) cannot ever come into my mind. I admit that sentiments of people are hurt. I apologise for it.” Raje was nominated to Rajya Sabha by the BJP four years ago with Fadnavis taking the lead to get him under the BJP umbrella.Fadnavis has recently been having a tough time on social media websites.

We have also spoken to education department officials and school principals,” he said.Teachers will start getting permission letters today, allowing them to travel to their schools to pick up the papers after they provide the letter as proof. Similarly, teachers who have already evaluated papers can send them to the moderators through the school or board staff.The Mumbai division of the school education board also covers schools in Thane, Raigad, and Palghar. Barring Raigad, all other areas come under the red zone where there are travel restrictions because of the coronavirus.Teachers said that they are awaiting instructions from the board. “Especially in red zones, we are worried about how transportation would take place. Some relaxation can be given in case there is no movement allowed,” said Uday Nare, teacher at Hansraj Morarji Public School in Andheri.The board is hoping that once permissions are in place, evaluation work can take place soon and results can be declared on time. The state board usually declares Class 12 results in the last week of May and Class 10 results are out by the second week of June. A Supreme Court order mandates the declaration of results by June 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ssc-paper-evaluation-edu-board-talks-to-authorities-teachers-about-travel-permissions/story-WzIZcF8kx5P48SzRFDZoOM.html

BMC is also preparing a plan for monsoon evacuees in view of social distancing rules. Fortunately, the areas that may need evacuation owing to monsoon have not seen any Covid-19 cases so far.Almost every year during monsoon months, the civic body is forced to move around 400 to 600 people living in four to five localities along the banks of Mithi, as the river overflows owing to heavy rain and high tide. The most-affected areas include Kranti Nagar, Indira Nagar and Bamandaya Pada in Andheri (East). BMC’s disaster management department generally prepare an evacuation plan, and the residents are moved to nearby municipal schools with the help of the local ward offices. However, in light of the crisis due to Covid-19 pandemic, major municipal schools across the city have been converted into quarantine centres to house asymptomatic positive patients and contacts of Covid-19 patients. Residents of slums where homes are congested, where residents use community toilets and where Covid-19 cases have been reported are also being moved to quarantine centres as a safety measure.Manish Walunju, assistant commissioner of L ward which covers these areas, said, “That school is not being converted into a CCC. I will need it during the monsoon. It a four-storey structure with two halls on the ground floor. So, about 800 to 1,000 people can stay there. If we need to evacuate people from Mithi’s banks during monsoon and this school is in walking distance from these two-three localities.”BMC is also preparing a plan with special instructions for maintaining social distancing norms in case more than 400 to 600 people need to be evacuated. Walunju said, “We have one-and-a-half month to chalk out the plan as the heavy rains are likely in June and July, going by the pattern every year. Since the school is in walking distance from the areas that we evacuate, it will be easier to plan keeping social distancing in mind.” Last year, BMC had moved about 400 people living in Kranti Nagar to this municipal school.Saeeda Khan, a corporator from L ward, said, “We have insisted that BMC divert the overflowing water to Vikhroli and Airoli creeks by micro tunnelling. This is the long-term solution. In case they need to shift people this year due to waterlogging, I will insist that BMC come up with a social distancing plan to ensure the rooms in the school do not get crowded with too many beds, and that they detect Covid-19 positive cases well in advance, if there are any, to avoid other residents coming in contact with people who may be carrying the virus while staying in the school. I am also going to ask for a separate school to be reserved for residents who live in Indira Nagar as a monsoon contingency plan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-reserves-civic-school-in-kurla-under-monsoon-contingency-plan-for-mithi-banks/story-xaBR2kX2ql46jDc2nU6MaP.html

08-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC pins hope on two drugs for Covid-19 treatment||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is pinning hopes on two drugs – Itolizumab, used to treat skin condition psoriasis; and Tocilizumab, used in case of rheumatoid arthritis – for treatment of Covid-19 patients.A 35-year-old critically ill Covid-19 patient, who was put on a clinical trial for Itolizumab at King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital on Saturday, has shown improvement, said doctors. The BMC now plans to administer the drug to patients at BYL Nair Hospital from Friday. Itolizumab is manufactured by a Bengaluru-based biotech company, Biocon, which has “repurposed” the drug for treatment of Covid-19 patients. The drug has been classified as a humanisedanti-CD6 monoclonal antibody, which means it is a molecule produced in a laboratory using living organisms. Once incubated into the body, it acts as an antibody, which can restore the immune system’s attack on foreign bodies. According to doctors at KEM, the pneumonitis in the lower zone of the 35-year-old patient’s both the lungs has improved. Also, his dependency on external oxygen has reduced. “The patient was on ventilator support. We have not taken it off, but he is recovering properly. We can administer it to more patients, if they agree for the trial,” said Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital. Dr Mohan Joshi, in-charge of Nair Hospital, said, “We have got permission to start the clinical trial for Itolizumab from Friday. Patients are selected for the trial depending on their health condition. It is not clear how many patients will be treated using the drug.”The other drug, Tocilizumab, is produced by Roche and marketed by Cipla. It helps prevent extreme inflammation in gravely ill Covid-19 patients. Of the 19 critically ill patients who were given the drug, 16 have shown signs of clinical recovery in radiological analysis within 24 hours. Their oxygen saturation in blood has also improved. “We have noticed considerable improvement in the health of the critically ill patients within 24 hours,” said Dr Joshi. “It will be tough to conclude the Itolizumab clinical trial a success depending on only one patient. Clinical trials need assessments of several patients which require time,” added Dr Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-pins-hope-on-two-drugs-for-covid-19-treatment/story-vlVQuO0nx95M6QdX7wnZsI.html

Last week, there were rumours that the institute had cancelled the exams altogether which led to anxiety among many students. However, on Wednesday, IIT-Bombay director Subhasis Chaudhuri dispelled the rumours and said a final decision was pending.“During pandemic of this kind, such rumours add to the agony and anxiety of the students who are away from the campus right now. Please stop spreading such fake news. Our senate will take a decision on this soon, and it will be reported on the institute’s website to inform all students,” said Chaudhuri.An expert committee formed by the Central government had, last month, suggested that universities hold online examinations. Meanwhile, different IITs have chalked out plans to conduct exams in batches while maintaining social distancing guidelines laid down by the Central government. While IIT-Roorkee has prioritised its final year students for the completion of semester, IIT-Madras may allow its students to take their exams at the nearest IIT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-b-admin-yet-to-decide-on-exams/story-7bJMHneyygYMUzdBrSo7QM.html
08-05-2020||City||Reopening order fails to lift liquor vendors’ spirits||Ludhiana/Bathinda Liquor vends remained shut in almost all districts of the state on Thursday, with owners claiming they would not be able to pay government fee for opening in the prevailing business conditions. In Ludhiana, 750 liquor vends in 150 groups remained shut. On Wednesday, the state excise and taxation department had issued an order allowing liquor vends to open from 9am to 3pm with home delivery allowed till 6pm. Punjab was one of the first states to seek permission from the Centre to seek opening of vends, but is yet to put a system in place, to actually do this, four days after this was allowed in phase 3 of the lockdown on May 3. The state has targeted an annual revenue of around Rs 6,200 crore from the trade. In April, the state lost around Rs 550 crore. A wine contractor Neeraj said, “We demand the withdrawal of quota system as regular sales cannot happen in these times. We are ready to open vends if the government fixes commission on sale of liquor.” Another contractor said, “We should not be levied fee for the days lost due to the curfew.” In South Malwa region, liquor vends did not open in Bathinda, Fazilka and Muktsar. Home delivery did not take off. In Bathinda, of 350 vends, only six opened in rural areas. In Mansa, vends opened in only three rural zones. Ferozepur deputy excise and taxation commissioner (DETC) HPS Gotra said less than 15% vends opened in Ferozepur, Faridkot and Moga districts, adding contractors were not keen on home delivery. Muktsar DC MK Aravind Kumar said due to the pandemic, only home delivery was allowed till May 10.Former SAD MLA and liquor baron Deep Malhotra, who has the majority share in liquor business in Bathinda district, told HT that liquor traders wanted the state government to compensate them for loss of business during lockdown. “It is unfair to charge a fee from contractors for 2020-21 fiscal on last year’s revenue, while allowing us to work only for a limited time,” said Malhotra, adding home delivery was not workable. “Due to the pandemic, most of our labour is going to their native places, causing staff shortage. Home delivery also entails risk of infection,” Malhotra added.Of 47 groups of liquor contractors, only three opened vends in Jalandhar on Thursday. Owners have sought relaxation in licence fee and slashing of tax. In Sangrur, vend owners said the government should clarify whether their licences would be considered valid from April 1 or May 7.In Majha, no vend opened. “Until a new policy that offers tax relaxation is not brought in, we will not open,” said a Tarn Taran contractor. In Amritsar, which has over 300 positive covid-19 cases, no shop was allowed to open. Shops did not open in Barnala as well.State cabinet to take call todayChief secretary Karan Avtar Singh, who is also financial commissioner, taxation, did not respond to calls and messages. A senior officer in the chief minister’s office (CMO), however, said this was just a matter of operationalising the liquor vends. “The lockdown restrictions have just been relaxed and they (liquor contractors) need labour, premises, etc. I am sure they will operationalise very soon,” he said. On their demands, he said these issues would come up before the state council of ministers on Friday. “The lockdown has altered the entire financial year and the state has lost about one month of excise sales. There will be some amendments in policy, accordingly. The excise and taxation department is putting up an agenda before the cabinet, which will take the final decision,” he said.— With inputs from Jalandhar, Amritsar and Barnala||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/reopening-order-fails-to-lift-liquor-vendors-spirits/story-kXkIfsCv2iy1OIRqfAJYzH.html
08-05-2020||City||1,200 leave in second Shramik Special from Hisar to Muzaffarpur||The second Shramik Special train left with 1,200 migrant labourers of various Haryana districts to Muzaffarpur in Bihar from Hisar railway station on Thursday.Haryana deputy speaker Ranbir Singh Gangwa, MLA Kamal Gupta, Hisar mayor Gautam Sardana, DC Hisar Priyanka Soni and SP Ganga Ram Punia flagged off the train.Total 1,200 migrants from Jind, Kaithal, Gurugram, Karnal, Bhiwani, Narnaul, Panipat, Ambala, Rohtak, Jhajjar, Yamunanagar, Dadri and Hansi reached Hisar in 37 Haryana Roadways buses to leave for eight districts of Bihar.DC Priyanka Soni said the migrant labourers will reach Muzaffarpur, where they will be quarantined and later allowed to go to their homes. Mayor Sardana, who distributed food, mask and hand sanitiser to the passengers, said, “With the help of various organisations, we prepared meals for the labourers and distributed among them. The administration is also provided them food and one-time meals will be arranged by the Railways as well.”Jhajjar DC Jitender Kumar said they had got requests from 151 migrant labourers. “We arranged five Haryana Roadways buses to send them to Hisar from Jhajjar,” he added.A migrant labourer, Rajesh Kumar, said after their health screening in Jhajjar, they were allowed to board the bus. “The administration helped us in every possible way,” he added.“Shramik Special” train leaves from Ambala Cantonment railway station for Bihar Amid heavy security and health check-ups, 1,188 migrant labourers from seven districts of Haryana boarded the first “Shramik Special” train from Ambala Cantonment railway station that left for Bihar on Thursday. The 24-coach train with around 54 passengers in each departed in the evening and is bound for Katihar district. Most of the migrants are from Saharsa, Madhyapura, Supaul, Aria and Purnia districts of Bihar. Deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma said, “Various teams have provided food packets, sanitisers, water bottles and masks to the travellers. Health check-ups have also been conducted on all of them before entering the station premises. Passengers include labourers from Ambala, Panipat, Bhiwani, Jind, Fatehabad, Hisar and Kaithal districts.” “They were provided tickets for free and we ensured seating arrangement is such that social distancing is maintained in each compartment,” Sharma added. Some of the passengers were visibly happy going home and a female passenger thanked a health official after her check-up before entering the station. Railway officials said the train will run via Saharanpur and is expected to reach its destination at 5pm on Friday. A passenger from Jind said, “I’m going back to my home in Madhyapura after almost six months. I was working at a grain market in Jind’s Mullana and was stuck amid the lockdown. We were told about this special train by the local police and were subsequently brought here by a bus.”(With inputs from Bhavey Nagpal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-200-leave-in-second-shramik-special-from-hisar-to-muzaffarpur/story-Ap87P63yrFZdhlYNBnHfwL.html

However, Bhise threatened to kill him and then stabbed Rawal on his stomach with a knife”Kailash Avhad, senior inspector from Vakola police station, confirmed the case and said Bhise was booked under sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and is currently in police custody till May 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/waiter-stabs-colleague-while-fighting-over-mobile-phone/story-dCuFz2elWsSnHwGiDTH77J.html
08-05-2020||Mumbai||Maha reports highest single-day toll of 43 deaths||Maharashtra recorded 1,216 new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases on Thursday, second-highest increase in a day so far.The death toll of the state also touched 694 as 43 fatalities, highest ever in a day, were registered on Thursday.The state’s case count, which went up to 17,974, is most likely to cross the 18,000 mark on Friday, eight days after it crossed 10,000 cases on April 30.The average of new cases daily has gone up to 1,000, raising concerns over the spread of the pandemic. In the second half of April, the average was 500.In Mumbai, the worst-hit city across the country, the case count also reached 11,394 with 680 new cases, prompting the Centre as well as the state government to plan aggressive quarantine arrangements, especially for congested areas and slums like Dharavi, where containing the disease is proving to be a major challenge for authorities.Of Thursday’s deaths, 24 were in Mumbai, seven in Pune, five in Vasai-Virar, two in Solapur, and one each in Palghar, Aurangabad and Akola. Also, one patient each from Manipur and Bihar died in Mumbai on Thursday. Of the deaths, 29 patients had comorbid conditions, said the health officials.In the past seven days, the state has registered 7,476 cases, which indicates that it is getting almost 1,000 new cases on a daily basis.However, the state government clarified that as many as 939 of the total cases are backlog figures, which were registered in the past few days and it will be streamlined once the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) application for daily data-entry of coronavirus cases is available on May 8.State officials also indicated a further rise in cases and said that the curve will be flattened only after completion of the fourth incubation period on May 17 and decline in cases is likely to start only by this month end. It could mean the peak in number of cases is yet to come.Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) said, “The graph will increase even further as several containment areas are densely populated so it is natural that it will affect a large number of people. The fresh cases are likely to increase a bit more in the coming days but by May 17 the curve will flatten because then we will be completing the fourth incubation period and by the end of this month, the number will start coming down.”Between April 19 and 30, the state was getting around 500 new cases on a daily basis but from May 1, the figures started showing significant rise.On May 1, the daily cases rose to 1,008, May 2 had 790 cases, May 3 had 678, May 4 had 771, May 5 had 841 and May 6 reported 1,233 cases. Besides, on May 4 & 5, the state also declared 796 and 143 cases additionally, saying that they were registered in the last few days and are being declared as per the Central government’s directive to bring the data at par with the national figures on the ICMR website.“The number of fresh cases has increased, but it cannot be called as exponential growth as we are also declaring backlog figures. It means, the data entry at laboratories are getting delayed due to some technical reason and figures get accumulated. To deal with this, ICMR is now coming up with an application on which data entry will be made on a daily basis and backlog figures will be removed. Only then we will come to know whether there is exponential growth or not,” Dr Lahane said.The first case in the state was found on March 9 and it took 30 days to the state to cross the 1,000 mark.In Mumbai, the worst-hit city across country, the case count also reached 11,394 as 680 new cases were registered in a day. The death toll of Mumbai also reached 437.The state health department said it is yet to add another 146 cases in Mumbai figures following ICMR website due to lack of reconciliation.Considering the rapid rise in Mumbai, the state government has now directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to start aggressive institutional quarantine to contain the spread in the city by acquiring additional grounds and halls.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the department has directed the Mumbai civic body to start “aggressive” institutional quarantine to curb the spread of Covid-19 cases. Tope said that a Central team, which is in Mumbai to oversee the preparedness, has suggested that the civic body should ramp up its institutional quarantine facilities.The minister added that social distancing measures cannot be followed in small houses in slums such as Dharavi, and therefore, close contacts of the people who test positive for coronavirus have to be kept in institutional quarantine.Tope said that the department has asked Mumbai civic chief Praveen Pradeshi to increase such facilities by acquiring additional grounds and halls. “With the cases increasing we are looking at altering the preparedness plan. Around 2,000 additional beds with oxygen supply facility are being put up at [Mahalaxmi] Race Course, MMRDA Ground at BKC, Goregoan (NESCO exhibition centre). A Central team is in Mumbai, they have asked us to increase institutional quarantine facilities. We have emphatically told the municipal commissioner to increase it in any condition. Wherever halls and playgrounds can be acquired, they need to be done,” he said.He added, “Unless people are taken out of a place like Dharavi, the spread cannot be contained. The people cannot be kept in a room of 10ft x 10ft. Now, we need to aggressively increase institutional quarantine.”So far, 13,494 people have been kept in institutional quarantine in the state and over 2,12,742 people have been put under home quarantine.He also appealed to people in the slums to come forward if they have any symptoms for early detection and to prevent the wider spread of the infection. He added that social distancing measures are also not followed in containment zones across the state and therefore cases are increasing from these zones in Mumbai, Pune, Malegaon, and Aurangabad.On Thursday, the state has also completed 45 days of lockdown, which was imposed from the midnight of March 23, a day before the nationwide lockdown imposed by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It was partially lifted on April 20 in the areas where there are no cases or minimal in number.The health department has conducted 2,02,105 tests at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra. Of them 1,83,880 people tested negative.State currently has 1,087 active containment zones. Around 12,021 survey teams comprising doctors and assisting staff have screened more than 51.76 lakh people for suspected infection.As the cases are rising, the number of cases recovered so far have also jumped to 3,301 as 207 patients recovered on Thursday.The doubling rate in the state now stands at 10 days. The state government, according to the health minister, has now decided to take the rate to 20 days.The mortality rate of the state has come down to 3.88% (651 deaths) on Wednesday from 7.41% (148 cases) on April 13. However, it is continued to be higher than the national mortality rate of 3.37% (1,781 deaths) till Wednesday, stated the data of the state medical education department.Tope said that the social distancing in containment zones is crucial. “The cases are increasing in containment zones because social distancing is not followed. Cases are increasing in Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad and Malegaon. People in these zones must work with the government and be alert,” he said.Several mathematical models have given projections for Mumbai, but there is no need to panic, the minister said. “We are preparing for all eventualities. In a meeting with the Union health minister, we have sought Army hospitals and railway coaches. But that will be kept as a last resort. We can use the coaches for asymptomatic patients or quarantine facilities.”The minister added that cluster-zone management needs to improve and stricter perimeter control needs to be put in place with the help of the police department to see that there is no to and fro movement.“Our intention is that the green zone should remain without any cases. There should not be any cases for 21 days in the orange zone. We do not want any cases in containment zones. Cluster zone management with the help of police would be strengthened. In red zone and containment zones in Mumbai, we would have to be more strict. People could face difficulties, but at the end of the day, lives matter,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-reports-highest-single-day-toll-of-43-deaths/story-LFwBglpcR1IXHhpTVEE29L.html
08-05-2020||Mumbai||3-storey isolation ward at Kasturba Hospital: Row over selection of bidder||The civic body’s selection of contractor to build a three-storey isolation ward at Kasturba Gandhi Hospital has drew some doubts with allegation that the selected lowest bidder has no prior experience of such construction. It was also alleged that the bidder was blacklisted in 2011. RTI activist Anil Galgali has alleged the selected bidder, Kinjal Civil Con LLP, does not have any prior work experience of such work, and questions as to why the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is taking such a risk during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Galgali said, “Inspired by China, BMC planned to use pre-engineered building (PEB) technique to construct isolation ward with a capacity of 60 beds. However, the selected lowest bidder (L1) has experience of only road and nullah constructions. How will he construct a hospital by using modern technique? The identified L1 bidder was earlier blacklisted in 2011 and was involved in cartel bidding for a zoo tender in 2016.”Civic officials said they have selected the bidder in a transparent manner and in accordance with the laid down procedure. They added the contract is yet to be awarded since the procedure is still on. Babasaheb Salve, deputy chief engineer (health infrastructure cell), said, “As part of the procedure, we have identified the L1 bidder. The procedure has been done in a completely transparent manner. Now the standing committee will take appropriate decision on the matter.”Divyesh Doshi, director at Kinjal Civil Con LLP, said, “There is no issue about my qualification in tendring process. I don’t know about any allegations. We have followed all procedures and have been selected as the lowest bidder.”Doshi further said, “We are not blacklisted. We have been working on even bigger project than this. It is not a new technology. We have enough work experience in construction field, which is why BMC shortlisted us. These allegations are made deliberately.”Opposition leader Ravi Raja said, “It is true that such skillful work needs prior experience in similar kinds of work. I have not yet received documents to study the subject properly. Let the subject come before the standing committee first. We will take necessary action then.”To deal with Covid-19 outbreak in the city, the civic body has decided to improve its health infrastructure, and as part of the plan it decided to construct a G+2 storey isolation ward with 60 beds at Kasturba Gandhi Hospital and floated a tender with estimated cost of Rs 73 crore. The civic body decided on using PEB technique so that project is completed in 90 days. Under PEB, building parts will be engineered at factory and assembled at site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-storey-isolation-ward-at-kasturba-hospital-row-over-selection-of-bidder/story-rR0UwdDGo4FR8LweOQZJ4N.html
08-05-2020||Mumbai||BMC to try Ayurvedic meds to shield frontline staff from virus||After giving anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to frontline workers, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is planning to try Ayurvedic treatment as prophylactic medicine for health workers and police personnel who come in direct contact with Covid-19 patients and are actively involved in containing the virus’ spread.“We have been approached by Ayurvedic doctors to consider other forms of treatment. So, we have formed a committee to look into its effectiveness and give us a suggestion on its usage,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.This move comes in the wake of reports that Kerala has begun clinical trials for Zingivir-H, an Ayurvedic medicine developed by Kerala-based Pankajakasthuri Herbal Research Foundation to treat respiratory infections, viral fever and acute viral bronchitis. The Clinical Trial Registry of India has approved Zingivir-H for trial on Covid-19 patients.Ayurvedic practitioners believe Ayurveda the potential to offer both preventive and curative treatments for Covid-19. “It is important to explore all possibilities. Ayurveda is the oldest medical treatment and has good potential in developing immunity among people. In fact, the Union health ministry has also suggested the same,” said Dr Surendra Mahate, an Ayurvedic doctor.At present, BMC is providing HCQ and Arsenic album 30 to frontline workers. However, scientific reports from abroad have suggested that many who were given this treatment developed side effects like hair loss, skin rash and headaches.“All these drugs are being given under corporate social responsibility activity and are preventive measures to control the infection. We have also requested the Ayush department to provide more homeopathy medicines,” said a health officer from the BMC.Dr Avinash Bondwe, president, Indian Medical Association, said there was no concrete evidence to suggest HCQ, Arsenic album 30 or Zingivir-H could be preventatives. “The BMC is trying every possible way to save its frontline warriors from contracting infection. But as studies on these medicines are still underway, it is too early to comment,” said Dr. Bondwe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-try-ayurvedic-meds-to-shield-frontline-staff-from-virus/story-Is2ECfHBpUckApjtxYc7UK.html
08-05-2020||City||ASHA workers: ‘Had to suspend work for Covid-positive colleague’||A day after the ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers’ union suspended work in Ambala demanding better facilities for their Covid-19 positive colleague, the health department on Thursday accepted their demands but refused to shift the patient to the other hospital.As per details, an ASHA worker in her late 30s and a resident of Dukheri village in Ambala cantonment had tested positive for the novel coronavirus on May 4. She was isolated at the designated hospital for Covid patients in Mullana along with 21 fresh cases, but another female doctor who tested positive on the same day was isolated at the civil hospital in Cantonment.The district ASHA workers’ body had protested and suspended work on May 6 demanding the department to shift their fellow worker to another hospital with better facilities for treatment.‘RISK IN SHIFTING PATIENTS’Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Kuldeep Singh said, “We have told the authorities in Mullana to take care of the facilities but there is no plan to shift her to any other hospital as there is always a risk in that.”Meanwhile, Anju, president of district ASHA workers’ union, said, “If the frontline health workers don’t get adequate facilities, then how can they help in this war against the pandemic?”She said, “We had to suspend work for one day because our fellow worker was not getting adequate facilities at the hospital. So many people are using the same toilet and there was also some problem with the food arrangement.”“However, our demands have been accepted by the administration and the health department. They have ensured better facilities for her and also told us that ASHA workers, if found positive, will be isolated at other hospitals in future,” she said.Around 900 ASHA workers have been performing Covid-related duties in Ambala district since April 4. Earlier, the workers were allotted duties in different areas to check the foreign returnees and ensure that they are quarantined. In the second round, they were allotted duties to check residents with flu-like symptoms and refer their case to the health officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/asha-workers-had-to-suspend-work-for-covid-positive-colleague/story-mso7QF4JXNJhjvYQIIHkeP.html
08-05-2020||Mumbai||CPCB directs states to track Covid-19 waste lifecycle, avoid spillage||The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has asked states to track Covid-19 waste disposal, check spillage and ensure proper segregation of the waste. The CPCB has created a digital tracking system and will share the application with the states. The app can monitor the lifecycle of waste from collection, segregation, transportation and incineration by geo-tagging each process and submitting details on a common platform. Details will be monitored by state pollution control boards, said CPCB, adding that the boards were informed on Wednesday.“All waste generators, transporters, and those handling treatment facilities will be asked to register on the app,” said Prashant Gargava, member secretary, CPCB. “Generators will have to key in location details from where the waste is collected and declare the number of yellow coloured bags (marked specifically for Covid-19 waste) and amount quantity handed over. Transporters will confirm how much quantity they have lifted, and the same procedure will be followed at the treatment facility,” he added. On April 21, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had raised concerns about possible environmental hazards due to improper Covid-19 waste disposal and directed the CPCB to ‘incorporate best practices through continuous supervision and monitoring’. Apart from creating awareness at the state and district level, CPCB was directed to develop a software to compile data in an online format by using a digital tracking system to log Covid-19 waste.“We have also observed that out of 2.7 lakh health care facilities (HCFs) identified, only 1.1 lakh HCFs are authorised under the Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016 so far. There appears to be a need for further revision of guidelines to cover all aspects, not merely institutions but also individual households... any unmindful deep burial without adequate safeguards can adversely affect the groundwater and pose danger to health and safety of people,” read the order passed by the NGT bench, headed by chairman Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel.“Common treatment facilities are reporting that they are receiving mixed waste in yellow bags, especially from quarantined homes, at major cities like Mumbai and Delhi,” said B Vinod Babu, nodal officer, waste management, CPCB. “The biggest problem is segregation as waste segregators are afraid of catching the virus. We have already told states to conduct programmes, webinars and awareness drives at all levels. The same has been communicated to expert committee members as per NGT directions,” he added. HT had reported on April 8 that not more than 50% of total Covid-19 waste collected by workers was being segregated at source, as per Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials. According to BMC, Mumbai is generating 800 to 1,000 kg of Covid-19 waste per day. However, data from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) shows the quantity to be between 4,000 to 5,000 kg for the city in the first week of May. Between March 22 and 31, the quantum of waste ranged between 500 to 600kg per day. It rose to an average of 1,500 kg during the first three weeks of April and 2,200 kg during the last week, MPCB data showed. There have also been reports of personal protective equipment (PPE) dumped or burnt openly. “There is little improvement in segregation at source but the process remains tough across containment areas. However, the civic chief has asked ward officers to implement necessary steps, including penal action for those violating waste treatment norms,” said a senior official from BMC’s solid waste management department.Waste generators include all hospitals, HCFs, quarantine camps, self-isolation homes and containment zones, added Gargava. “The data from the application will help identify gaps in the system, avoid spillage and ensure accountability,” he said. “If there is any discrepancy, the state board can know how many yellow bags were collected, status of deep-burial pits at landfills or adequate incinerators available for disposal etc,” said the member secretary. States will have to take a call on the extent of penal action, said Gargava. “Provisions under the biomedical waste rules would be applicable for those violating the process,” he said.Evidence of transmission of the Sars-Cov-2 virus through waste has not yet been established, said Babu. “However, studies have indicated the possibility of aerosol transmission with the virus surviving for a limited period on PPE. This puts waste handlers at risk and we need to be extra cautious,” he added. CPCB has revised its Covid-19 waste management guidelines thrice so far to incorporate developments arising from an increase in cases and quarantined areas in major cities. “HCFs have even been directed to disinfect sewage discharged at each establishment. NGT also wanted us to revise guidelines with respect to individual households. We are working on that, and additional directives will be issued soon,” said Gargava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cpcb-directs-states-to-track-covid-19-waste-lifecycle-avoid-spillage/story-YkEjysAbnuNIMGhEGZMUhP.html

An official from G-North ward, which covers Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim, confirmed that two cases from Dadar and five cases from Mahim have been reported on Thursday. The total cases in Dadar have reached 66, and 96 in Mahim.BMC is also continuing its slum survey to identify senior citizens with comorbidities. As part of this initiative, the BMC claims to have surveyed over 17 lakh people and met above 58,000 senior citizens to check for comorbidities. Of these, 700 were found with low oxygen levels and 594 were proactively treated even though none of them had Covid-19 symptoms. The BMC has claimed to have surveyed 32 lakh houses across the city so far to screen residents for symptoms of Covid-19 and covered 1.27 crore people in those surveys. More than two lakh people have been traced through contact tracing. Meanwhile, the BMC’s F-North ward, consisting of Wadala, Matunga and certain parts of Dadar, will be under complete lockdown for 10 days starting Friday. The BMC officials said no vegetables will be sold in the area and only medical shops will remain open till May 17.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-books-3-3k-rooms-in-88-hotels-to-quarantine-passengers-from-special-flights/story-Na8cP6099bZY7d2rOzc4uN.html

The IDSP is a programme under the National Health Mission (NHM). IDSP workers stay on the field to collect data on diseases, conduct surveys and maintain surveillance. Professionals like epidemiologists, microbiologists, entomologists, finance consultants, data managers and entry operators under the IDSP have been deployed across districts. They have now written a letter to Punjab NHM director Kumar Rahul demanding the implementation of the salary hike announced last month. “We are getting meagre pay compared to the work we are doing in the times of pandemic, but we have never complained as it is our duty to safeguard the nation. We are the frontline warriors but instead of encouraging us the government has discouraged us by taking back the salary hike order. Haryana has hiked salaries, but Punjab is doing nothing,” claimed Dr Anita Chauhan, epidemiologist, Faridkot.Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said they would issue another letter to implement salary hike for IDSP staff. “Our front line workers have done a commendable job to fight against covid-19, they will be rewarded,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/idsp-staff-threaten-strike-if-salary-not-hiked/story-0ji2PEGImdezb9Lwa0wjUJ.html

These include the construction of retaining walls, work of shore piling to protect against landslides, waterproofing of terraces and exposed areas, completion of basements and other sub-soil works. However, no permission for new construction or for construction work apart from pre-monsoon work is being given by the BMC.Vinod Chithore, chief engineer of the BMC’s development plan department, said, “We have received around 350 applications till date, and we have approved more than 200 proposals till now. It is a continuous process, and we will clear all the pending proposals for whoever agrees to follow the conditions laid down by the BMC.” The BMC had made it mandatory for developers to have the labourers in situ (on the site) wherever construction work is ongoing, however, while large-sized developers had the labour, many mid-sized or small-sized developers have not been able to apply for permission considering there is no labour available in the market. Also, several developers have cited that while construction permission is being given for projects where labour is available on the site, but travel permission for supervisors, engineers on the site is becoming challenging owing to approvals taking the time. Further, several other conditions put by the BMC include labourers wearing masks, having medical checkups twice a week, isolation facility at the site, and maintaining social distancing at the construction site.Niranjan Hiranandani, managing director of Hiranandani group, said, “We have resumed work at ongoing projects in Powai, Thane and Panvel. Across the three locations, at our ongoing projects, we have 3000-plus workers who have started working. The site administration peculiarly takes all the necessary prevention measures like fumigation, disinfectant, wearing mask and gloves, staggered labour spread, sanitisation to follow the best guidelines practice.”Meanwhile, another developer Harshul Savla of M-Realty, said, “The conditions are quite stringent, and there is no single-window clearance for getting permissions. Wherever labour is available on the site, there is a problem for daily travel of supervisors and engineers to the project site. The BMC is permitting construction work, and not travel passes, and due to this a lot of time goes only getting permissions. The issuing of permissions should have been more lenient.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-gives-pre-monsoon-construction-nod-to-200-realty-projects/story-hogb0Js0UioaYyDdJg8BrI.html
08-05-2020||Mumbai||Video shows Covid-19 victims’ bodies kept in ward with patients in Mumbai, probe ordered||A day after a video surfaced showing how bodies of Covid-19 victims at Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, also known as Sion hospital, were left in a ward for an extended period alongside patients, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has ordered an inquiry into the matter. A committee for the same has been asked to submit its report within 24 hours.On Wednesday night, MLA Nitish Rane posted the video which claimed that patients at Sion hospital were sharing the ward with dead bodies.The incident has again highlighted the casual way in which municipal hospitals handle bodies of Covid-19 patients, despite directions for them to be shifted from the ward within 30 minutes of being declared dead.The video shows Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment in a ward with dead bodies wrapped in black plastic covers lying near them. This is in violation of the rules of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) which state that deceased patients should be wrapped in airtight body bags to avoid possible transmission of the Sars-CoV-2 virus.“I have never seen such a horrendous situation [in Mumbai] where patients are made to share beds beside bodies. This causes severe psychological trauma among patients,” said BJP leader Kirit Somaiya, who has filed a complaint with the ICMR.The hospital said that often patients’ relatives do not come to claim bodies. Sometimes, it takes longer to wrap the body and send it to the morgue. “Being a non-Covid hospital, we have to attend to both Covid and non-Covid patients. This is a severe workload on us as we are already running at 60% staff strength. It is not always possible to shift a body within 30 minutes. Also, often the family members request us to wait for them before wrapping the body,” said a senior official from the hospital.Sion hospital dean Pramod Ingale said relatives of those who died of Covid-19 were also reluctant to take the bodies. “We have removed the bodies and will investigate the matter. We have got instructions that the families of the deceased need to claim the bodies within 30 minutes,” he said.The BMC has also formed a team to investigate the matter and submit a report within 24 hours. According to a letter issued to the hospital on May 7, the team has been instructed to find the person who shot the video and probe the reason behind the delay in shifting the bodies to the morgue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/video-shows-covid-19-victims-bodies-lying-near-patients-at-sion-hospital-bmc-to-inquire/story-KXlrvv0yKoNVBsMlBX134O.html
08-05-2020||Delhi||CM Arvind Kejriwal announces Rs 1 crore aid for family of Delhi cop who died of Covid-19||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said the Delhi government will give ₹1 crore aid to the family of the 31-year-old Delhi Police constable who died of Covid-19 on Tuesday.In a tweet, Kejriwal said the police constable kept “serving the people of Delhi without fearing about risks to his life at the time of such a health crisis. He was infected with the virus while serving us and later died. I pay him tribute on behalf of all residents of Delhi. The government shall help his family with an ex-gratia compensation of Rs 1 crore.” The constable, who was posted at Bharat Nagar police station in northwest Delhi, was on duty till Monday. He developed flu-like symptoms and was taken to two hospitals by colleagues, before being taken to RML hospital, where has declared dead on arrival. He had tested positive at a private lab. Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west), said the constable’s test had returned positive from RML Hospital as well, where he was tested a second time following his death. She said 10 police personnel, some from Bharat Nagar police station where he was posted, and others from the crime records office in Kamla Market that he would visit as part of his duty, have been quarantined since they were found to have come in contact with the constable as part of their job.The constable was cremated at the Punjabi Bagh crematorium on Thursday in the presence of some senior police officers and his family.The constable was a resident of Haryana’s Sonepat and is survived by his wife and three-year-old son. His wife is a contractual teacher at a North Delhi Municipal Corporation primary school.Her relatives on Wednesday said they have asked north municipality officials to make her a permanent employee.“She has her whole life ahead. Some teachers, on our behalf, have also placed a request with senior north municipality officials for her to be made a permanent employee.”The north municipality mayor, Avtar Singh, said there is no precedent for such an appointment. “This is different from postings on compassionate grounds where the spouse or child of a deceased, who was already serving in our corporations, is given a job. However, looking at the sacrifice this policeman made, we will definitely write to the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) to allow us to make Pooja permanent at work,” Singh said. Delhi L-G Anil Baijal on Wednesday tweeted that “his sacrifice in the fight against COVID-19 will always be remembered” and that he was “a great warrior who brought glory to the frontline police personnel fighting against pandemic”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cm-announces-1cr-aid-for-family-of-delhi-cop-who-died-of-covid-19/story-yz1L0lDpyFr6ZNFF84VzYP.html
08-05-2020||Delhi||13-year-old boy dies in Delhi’s Rohini, locals say he was beaten by cop||A 13-year-old boy died in Rohini’s Prashant Vihar on Wednesday, following which local residents accused a policeman of hitting him with a stick while he was waiting outside a shop to photocopy an Aadhaar card to obtain ration. The police denied the allegations, saying it was an accidental death caused by a fall in a public park.The police have requested the constitution of a panel of experts to oversee an autopsy of the body.The boy, who lived with his parents and three siblings in Rajapur neighbourhood of Rohini Sector 9, was a class 8 student of a government school and used to help his ailing father sell vegetables and fruits on a pushcart.“I have suffered paralysis twice in the past and have poor health. My son was an intelligent boy and would help me negotiate with customers and receive payments,” the boy’s father said.The family used to also run a tea stall, which has been shut since the lockdown.The boy’s mother said, “On Tuesday afternoon, we heard that ration would be provided to the poor (in our neighbourhood) who could provide a copy of their Aadhaar card. Since we were short of money, we also decided to seek ration.”She said her son, accompanied by some neighbours, had gone to get a photocopy of her husband’s Aadhaar card.A youngster, who claimed to be an eyewitness, said that the boy was playing a game on his mobile phone while waiting outside the photocopy shop, when two policemen on a motorcycle approached them. “They began hitting us with a stick. One hit was directed at another man, but it missed its mark and landed on the boy’s neck. He collapsed right away,” the eyewitness said.Residents called for CCTV footage from the market to be checked to ascertain the truth.However, the police had an entirely different version of the events leading to death.Pramod Kumar Mishra, the deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Rohini, said that as per the initial inquiry, the boy and a few others were seated inside a park, defying the lockdown orders and social distancing norms.“Two beat constables were patrolling the area on a motorcycle and noticed them. From outside the park boundary, the policemen asked them to leave. The youngsters began running away. It was during that time that the boy fell and fainted. The others managed to escape,” said DCP Mishra.The officer said that while one policeman immediately brought water for the unconscious boy, the other rushed to bring a jeep from the police station in the vicinity. “He was taken to Ambedkar Hospital, from where be was referred to Safdarjung Hospital. He died on Wednesday morning,” the DCP said.Mishra said that while there were no external injuries on the boy’s body, a request has been made to form a panel of doctors to carry out his autopsy. “We have not given a clean chit to anyone and will probe the case impartially,” said the DCP, adding that a first information report (FIR) will be filed only if there is an indication of foul play.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-cops-blamed-for-13-year-old-boy-s-death-in-rohini-police-refute-claim/story-qTpMgHzIaMzjSIr7GyjbCO.html
08-05-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 containment zone residents in Delhi demand relief from curbs||It has been over 30 days since Nihal Ahmad has been able to visit an ATM to withdraw cash. He has been locked inside his house in Ekta Vihar area of Pratap Khand in east Delhi’s Shahdara district. His movement, as well as that of other residents in the neighbourhood, has been strictly restricted since April 8, when Pratap Khand in Jhilmil Colony was declared a containment zone after two people tested Covid-19 positive. Residents of Pratap Khand on Thursday staged a demonstration in the locality, demanding their area be de-contained since they were facing lot of problems in procuring essential commodities and going about regular activities. Scores of residents stepped out of their houses on Thursday morning and gathered near police barricades, from where the colony has been cordoned off, to protest against the authorities for not de-containing the colony even after a month. They complained about the irregular supply of essential items such as milk, vegetables, fruits and medicines in the last few weeks. “I require cash and we cannot go to ATMs to withdraw it. There is no proper arrangement for mobile ATMs. It has been over a month since the entire locality was sealed due to Covid-19 cases. Now no new cases are emerging yet our colony is marked as a red zone while many areas in the city are being de-sealed. The area should be de-contained now,” Ahmad said.Another resident of the locality, Yogesh Kumar Bhati, who was also at the protest, said that initially, the system of home delivery of essential items was working fine, but now it has become erratic. Residents complained that even after hours of placing orders with the notified vendors of the area, they have to wait, sometimes an entire day, for the delivery. “Most vendors, who are authorised to deliver essentials in the locality, open their shops in the morning and evening only. So if you need anything urgently you have to wait the entire day. We demand the colony should be opened and if any case is found, then that particular lane or block should be contained not the entire locality,” he said.A senior official of the district administration, who wished not to be named, said a few cases were reported in the area even after April 15, that’s why the locality was not de-contained. The official said that a discussion and survey would be conducted with the health department officials to decide when to de-seal the area. “We are making all possible arrangements. For the home delivery of items, we have engaged civil defence volunteers. But still, if residents are facing problems then will look into the matter,” the district administration official said.Containment zones are complete quarantine zones and no one is allowed to go out even to buy essential goods such as milk, vegetables, fruits etc. All entry and exit points and even internal lanes are barricaded in containment zones. The authorities allow only selected vendors to supply groceries and other essentials to the neighbourhood. Till Thursday, Delhi had 86 containment zones. As per the central government’s guidelines, an area can be de-contained only when no fresh Covid-19 positive cases are reported in the last 28 days. Till now, 14 areas have been de-contained in Delhi.The residents of other containment areas in the city also complained about the irregular supply of essential items such as milk, vegetables, fruits and medicines. In south-west Delhi’s Bengali Colony in Mahavir Enclave, residents complained that though in the beginning services were delivered smoothly, over the last 10 days, even sanitation and disinfection is not taking place regularly. Bengali Colony was made a containment zone on April 12 when one Covid-19 positive case was found in the locality. The area has been in containment for the last 25 days.Sunita Nagar, a resident of the colony who lives with her six-month-old daughter and her old parents, said that the biggest problem that she has been facing since the area was contained is to find items for her baby. “The colony was locked up in a day and I did not get a chance to stock up on my daughter’s essentials such as diapers, wipes and milk power. In the beginning, the vendors here would delivery some of the items but now I am finding it hard to get the things I need,” Nagar said. In Dinpur Village, residents said that residents are fed up of the authorities keeping them locked up “for no reason”. Dinpur village was made a containment zone on April 8 when three cases of a family were reported Covid-19 positive. The village has been under containment for last 27 days.“We agree that there were one or two cases from the colony, but you contain those houses, why are you keeping the entire colony locked? We are ready to co-operate with the agencies but there should be some relaxations,” Dhruv Pradhan, a local politician living in the south-west Delhi village, said. In the Zakir Nagar containment area, residents complained about the irregular supply of drinking water bottles. Gali number 18 to 22 in Zakir Nagar were contained on April 10 after two residents tested Covid-19 positive.“People in the area purchase 20-litre water bottles but the authorities do not allow them to be delivered at home. Plus the supply is also irregular,” Shoeb Danish, councillor of the area, said.District magistrate (south-west) Rahul Singh said that the assessment of areas was ongoing to ascertain when they could be de-contained. “I have not yet received any complaint about irregular supplies in containment areas. But still, we will look into the matter,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/residents-of-containment-zones-allege-lack-of-supplies-being-sealed-in-for-too-long/story-C5y8rMqnbb4fHKYbHQezjN.html
08-05-2020||Delhi||First batch of 1,050 migrants leave Delhi for Madhya Pradesh aboard special train||As many as 1,050 migrant workers, stranded in the city after a national lockdown was announced to curb the spread of Covid-19, left for Madhya Pradesh’s Chhatarpur on Thursday evening on board a special train from New Delhi. These men, women and children were among Delhi’s first batch of stranded workers who left the city for their home state under a government order that allows for inter-state movement of stranded individuals by buses and trains to be arranged by the state governments concerned. A Delhi government official associated with the operation said the city currently has at least 18,000 migrant workers lodged in 240-odd shelters operated by the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), where they share space with other homeless people, and around as many small and large temporary shelter camps run by the district administrations.“First train carrying 1050 migrants from Delhi left for Chattarpur, MP, today at 8 pm. A series of such trains would be carrying migrants to different parts of India in the coming days,” said Delhi’s revenue and transport minister Kailash Gahlot. In the next three days, more special trains are expected to depart for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar -- states from which the largest share of stranded migrant workers are in the Capital at this juncture, said a second government official, adding: “The Delhi government has already had discussions with UP and Bihar. Next in line are states such as Jharkhand, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Odisha.” The second train will most likely leave tomorrow for Bihar, the official said. Rail operations were suspended completely on March 25, for the first time in history of independent India, and it would continue to remain closed till at least May 17 -- the last day of the third phase of the national lockdown.The migrants were brought to the station from across Delhi districts in nearly 75 Delhi Transport Corporation’s low-floor buses. Before they boarded the buses, they were all screened for flu-like symptoms. After they reach Madhya Pradesh, they will be screened again and sent into 14-day quarantine. “The protocol is clear on that,” said the official.“The central government will bear 85% of the ticket price, and the remaining 15% will be taken care of by the home state (Madhya Pradesh). It is being implemented strictly under the rules drafted by the central government,” the senior official said. Sonu Kumar Singh, 27, one among 1050 passengers on board the special train, said he cannot wait to see his family back in his village in Madhya Pradesh’s Bundelkhand. “My mother is eagerly waiting for me. In my village, we have a small piece of land where I can do farming. At least I will not starve as it happened here in the last few weeks. I often had to sleep on empty stomach,” said Singh while walking inside the New Delhi Railway Station with his bag. Singh, a labourer, had been living in a government-run shelter in southwest Delhi district since March 30.The platforms, the parking lots, the pedestrian bridges and the concrete entrance area of the New Delhi Railway Station witnessed some semblance of life after more than six weeks when the migrants walked into it along with groups of health officials, civil defence volunteers and the police. Sanjay Kumar, 51, who was accompanied by his family of six including two grandchildren, said he was relieved to be able to go back home. “There was nothing left here. There was no work, no money and meagre food. Later, if things get normal, I will think of coming back,” said Kumar, a labourer at Paharganj market. Manish (doesn’t use a second name), 36, said that he was too happy to be going back home. “It had become difficult to survive. It was almost like a punishment to live in the shelter and today, I feel I have been released from a prison,” said Manish, who used to work at a restaurant in Rajouri Garden. Several government officials have claimed that thousands of workers have decided to stay back after they witnessed partial relaxation of the lockdown norms and revival of in industrial and construction activities this week.“More than 10,000 people from several states have applied for being sent back to their home states in the last five days. While the DUSIB has submitted a final list pertaining to shelters under them, which has around 700 names, the collective list pertaining to shelters under the district magistrates are getting updated every day. Currently, we have around 10,000 applicants in it,” said the first official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/first-batch-of-stranded-migrants-leave-delhi-for-mp-on-board-special-train/story-4cobk56ZRVbzw6MmcExPCJ.html
08-05-2020||Delhi||450-bed Covid Care Centre to start in new Burari hospital||With the rising number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the city, the Delhi government has decided to start a 450-bed Covid Care Centre at its newly constructed hospital in Burari to cater to those with mild symptoms.The hospital is yet to open.So far, there are 12 Covid Care Centres in the city—where people with low-grade fever, sore throat, malaise and other such mild symptoms are admitted—most of which are situated in unused Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) or Delhi Development Authority (DDA) flats. The Burari facility was designed to be a 768-bed tertiary care hospital, which has been under construction since the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s first full term. Even after completion of the construction, the government is still discussing whether the hospital should be run under a public-private-partnership (PPP) model.Two other super-speciality hospitals in Janakpuri and Tahirpur were to be operated under the PPP model when Sheila Dikshit’s Congress government was in power; however, they were later operationalised as government-run autonomous institutes. One of these hospitals, the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital in Tahirpur, has now been converted into 500-bed dedicated Covid-19 hospital.Amid the Covid-19 crisis, the AAP government has also begun work on operationalising two of its other newly constructed hospitals in Ambedkar Nagar and Dwarka.The three hospitals will together add over 2,500 beds to the existing 11,770 beds in Delhi government-run hospitals.“This is part of the routine work to open up more hospitals. Work will begin to open these hospitals up soon. However, the hospital in Burari (the construction of which is almost finished) will take a while to open as the government is still deciding if it will be run on a PPP model,” a senior official in Delhi’s health department said.These hospitals might also be designated for Covid-19 care if the need arises.“Currently, there are two designated hospitals under the Delhi government with 2,500 beds to take care of Covid-19 patients. However, if there is a need for more beds, then the new hospitals might also be brought in use as it would be easier to keep the people with viral infection in isolation at the new facilities. There will be no intermixing with non-Covid-19 patients,” the official quoted above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/450-bed-covid-care-centre-to-start-in-new-burari-hospital/story-oMuYEZRNMwL7cXcJo79gMK.html
08-05-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 update: Delhi starts e-token system for liquor purchases to avoid crowding||To avoid crowding at liquor shops, the Delhi government has started issuing e-tokens, specifying the store and timings, for residents on a web link set up by the excise department. Since Monday, when the government allowed around 172 liquor shops in the city to open after more than six weeks of lockdown, people have been crowding spaces outside liquor stores, violating social distancing norms that are mandated to curb the spread of Covid-19.The government continued its deliberations over home delivery of liquor and a decision is likely to be taken by the weekend, a senior official said. The chief secretary has already asked the excise commissioner to chalk out a plan “at the earliest”, he said.“In a bid to ensure social distancing and to stop overcrowding at the liquor shops, the Delhi government on Thursday launched an e-token service to buy liquor. The Delhi government took this decision to encourage people to avoid long queues by applying for an e-token with time slot at any nearby shop to buy liquor,” read a government statement issued on Thursday.The statement read, “Any person can apply for an e-token through the link ‘https://www.qtoken.in/’. Name and phone number will be required while applying and the e-coupon will be sent to the registered mobile number. With that e-token, the person will be allowed to buy liquor from the nearby shops. This will be an additional facility to reduce overcrowding at the liquor shops.”The weblink was non-functional till Thursday night. A senior official attributed that to “high traffic within a limited time after announcement” and claimed that it would be functional in a few hours.While Thursday was a dry day in Delhi, liquor shops would also start issuing coupons to people standing outside in queues, as per a government order, which also directed the deployment of marshals, to ensure social distancing, and use of more barricades, for area management.The additional tax of 70% on the maximum retail price of liquor would continue in Delhi.The municipalities on Thursday submitted a list of 30 private liquor shops in the city that are not located in markets, malls, commercial spaces and shopping complexes, and, hence, qualify for relaxations under the Central government’s guidelines applicable to red zones a second senior government official said. “An order to implement relaxation for private shops is expected in a day or two. Meanwhile, all government shops that were allowed to operate but could not function over the last four days for a range of reasons — lack of staff, inadequate stock to law and order issues — are set to resume from Friday. Increasing the overall strength of shops to 200 would help reducing mass gatherings outside shops to a large extent,” the official said.Delhi has 864 liquor shops, of which 475 are owned by government departments, ranging from tourism to industrial and infrastructure development. The other 389 are owned by private individuals and enterprises.“Only 50 (of the 172) could function full day on an average between Monday and Thursday. That is one reason for massive crowds outside most shops,” the second senior government official said.While most government shops function with L-6 and L-8 licences, which allow the sale of Indian manufactured foreign liquor and country liquor, respectively, most private shops have an L-10 licence, which allows the sale of imported liquor too.On Thursday, representatives of the Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies wrote to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, seeking a review of the 70% special corona fees and urged that private shops that are not located in containment zones be allowed to open and restaurants, bars and pubs be allowed to sell their unfinished stock by initiating a “take-away only” facility.The Confederation also urged the government to allow home delivery of liquor. “Such a facility can reduce at least 15%-20% physical crowd from the shops… A clear announcement of the period of imposing the special cess would also help people plan their purchases and reduce crowds,” said Vinod Giri, the director-general of the Confederation.On Thursday, the Confederation met deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and submitted a memorandum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-starts-e-token-system-for-liquor-purchases/story-gWjVtuMzCtbgouiOAb9sPK.html
08-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi gears up to receive over 400 returnees from abroad in special flights||With Delhi residents expected to return from across the globe over the next eight days, the Delhi government on Thursday arranged for paid quarantine facilities in more than 1,500 rooms in city hotels.More than 400 people are expected to arrive at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport from Singapore and Dhaka in Bangladesh on Friday, as part of the Vande Bharat mission to ferry back Indians stranded abroad, the city administration said on Thursday.Under the exercise , launched by the Union government on Thursday, national carrier Air India is bringing Indian citizens stuck abroad back to the country. At the same time, it will also send US, UK and Singapore stuck in the country.The Delhi government issued a revised order on Thursday on the rules for handling passengers arriving in Delhi from abroad, in which it specified that everyone will have to mandatorily be under institutional quarantine in a paid facility for 14 days from the date of arrival.The order clarified that Delhi will house returnees belonging to neighbouring states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. This clarification came after the Delhi government, in its previous order issued on Wednesday, had asked the respective states to ferry the passengers in buses.“We are expecting to handle 410 passengers on Day one (Friday) of the operation in Delhi. One flight, carrying 243 passengers, will arrive at 11.30am from Singapore and a second flight, ferrying 167 people, will land in Delhi around 1pm from Dhaka,” a senior government official said.Shilpa Shinde, special secretary (health and family welfare), has been appointed the nodal officer for the Delhi chapter of the operation.“Everyone will have to mandatorily undergo screening at the airport. We have arranged for over a dozen buses to transport passengers from the airport to the paid quarantine facilities. No option of home quarantine or free government quarantine will be given as of now,” said Shinde.She said that the government has also kept free quarantine facilities on standby.Explaining the reason for providing the option of only paid facilities to the passengers, another senior official said the government will not be in a situation to address any grievances related to the quality of standards at the free quarantine centres.The government has tied up with seven hotels for quarantine facilities, which will be offered for prices between Rs 2,000 plus taxes and Rs 4,800 plus taxes, depending on the overall rating of the hotel and the choice of room (single or double bed).The rate includes breakfast, lunch and dinner, two bottles of mineral water per day, tea and coffee, and other facilities, such as Wi-Fi and TV. Food from a set menu will be served to the quarantined guests only in disposal plates and their clothes will be laundered separately.About 200 rooms at Hotel Le Meridian, 200 at Sheraton, 250 at Vivanta by Taj in Dwarka, have been reserved for the purpose, besides rooms at Red Fox and IBIS in Aerocity, Welcome Hotel by ITC and Red Fox in Mayur Vihar Phase 1.A spokesperson for the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), said, “The standard operating procedures for handling passengers of repatriation flights have been developed by the ministries and agencies concerned. This includes maintaining social distance, which would also be mandatory for the passengers to follow while getting off the aircraft. The government and Air India have been working out the logistics of the repatriation flights based on the number of citizens to be brought back to the country. The first such flight is expected to arrive in Delhi on Friday.“We are expecting about 200 passengers per flight. The Delhi government will be determining the locations where the arriving passengers would be sent for quarantine. The airlines, their ground handlers, DIAL staff, immigrations, CISF and customs will be supporting the APHO and Delhi government during these operations.”The airline staff will ensure that the passengers have filled their self-reporting forms properly and download the Arogya Setu app on their mobile phones, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-gears-up-to-receive-over-400-returnees-from-abroad-in-special-flights/story-QwWQk7Q1AbhJ1axbe4qZyJ.html
08-05-2020||Delhi||Safdarjung opens OPD for new patients after Delhi complains of unequal division||Safdarjung Hospital on Wednesday opened up its outpatient clinics for new patients, after the Delhi government has raised the issue of central government hospitals in the city not treating enough non-Covid-19 patients with Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan earlier this week, with routine services being restricted at most city hospitals to maintain social-distancing, Several Delhi government hospitals have reported working on more than 100% capacity, with patients being referred to them from central government hospitals as well as private centres.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had suggested that one of the three central government-run hospitals in Delhi – Safdarjung, Ram Manohar Lohia (RML), and Lady Hardinge – be converted to a dedicated Covid-19 facility, with the other two providing routine services.“There have been cases of patients being refused routine treatment, with it being stated that three hospitals treat Covid-19 patients. Also, the 4,000-bed AIIMS has taken a good step and dedicated the trauma centre and the cancer centre in Jhajjar for Covid-19 patients but all other services have been stopped at the hospital. I urge you to restart the other facilities for non-Covid patients,” Jain had said in the meeting.Dr Harsh Vardhan had responded that all hospitals were treating patients and if any case of patients being turned away comes to light then the governments should discuss the matters with each other.A doctor from Safdarjung, on the condition of anonymity, said: “The Covid-19 situation is going to last for some time and in the meanwhile there were many patients who were not getting the treatment they need. Although patients already registered with us were being given consultation previously, the service has now been opened to all. We are getting a huge number of referral cases from other hospitals like AIIMS and RML.”Doctors say routine services have been restricted at most city hospitals to maintain social distancing. “Maintaining social distance at the hospital is not possible because we still have two or more patients on a bed. Several of whom have been referred from big hospitals such as RML and LHMC,” said a doctor from Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital in Khichdipur.As of May 7, there were 112 Covid-19 patients admitted to Safdarjung hospital, 61 to RML, and 28 to Lady Hardinge Medical College, according to the daily data. At the Safdarjung hospital, the services are running at over 100% capacity even in the non-Covid-19 areas of the hospital, said the doctor quoted earlier.At RML, although routine out-patient clinics are running, most wards are being used for Covid-19 cases or those with severe acute respiratory infections who are suspected to have Covid-19.“The non-Covid-19 services are very limited. The dire emergency cases are being accepted, but other than that, most wards are being used for the treatment of SARI and Covid-19 patients,” said a doctor from the hospital, on condition of anonymity. The hospital has about 1,420 beds.As for AIIMS, which had been the hospital under focus, 312 Covid-19 patients were admitted in total to Jhajjar and Trauma Centre as on May 6.“There are around 300 Covid-19 patients admitted to the trauma centre and AIIMS Jhajjar. Apart from that, there are about 1,100 to 1,200 other patients admitted in the main campus that has about 2,400 beds. These are patients who come to our emergency department and are usually in need of admission and surgeries. There are also some patients who were admitted before the lockdown,” said a senior doctor from the hospital, asking not to be named.Another doctor, requesting anonymity, added, “AIIMS Jhajjar is also drawing staff from the main AIIMS campus, in addition it is a big facility, so all services cannot be resumed immediately. Also, to ensure that social distancing is followed, the number of patients that are being admitted is lesser than the usual.” A decision is yet to be taken on restarting the physical clinics and routine surgeries, the doctor cited above added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-urged-central-hospitals-to-treat-more-routine-patients/story-0UFRPZ8NNB5xlPulQjyWSM.html
08-05-2020||Delhi||Health care workers say border curbs have hit medical services, tests in Delhi||Health care services – including Covid-19 testing – across Delhi have been affected, with neighbouring states closing down inter-state borders and barring the movement of even medical workers. The Haryana government had shut the Faridabad border completely and implemented strict checks at the Gurugram border last week.The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday advised resident welfare associations (RWAs) in Ghaziabad to ask doctors working in Delhi to stay in the Capital during the lockdown.In a circular, the UP government said, “In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the RWAs are requested to advise doctors working in Delhi hospitals to stay in Delhi and offer their services during the lockdown so that more people do not get infected.”At least 100 staff members of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) who live beyond Delhi’s borders have not been able to report for duty, as a result of these curbs. “There are many people who stay across the border who are now not able report for work. And, it is a significant number — at least a 100. This is impacting health services,” said a doctor from the hospital, on condition of anonymity.Officials said more than 35% of health care workers in Safdarjung hospital have to commute across the border. “The border issue needs to be sorted out fast. We are falling short of health care workers with around 35% of our staff living across the border. For now, we are asking people to work longer shifts or take double shifts, but that cannot be sustained. It is very difficult to pull off long shifts in Covid-19 areas. If immediate relief is not provided, our remaining health care workers will get exhausted very soon,” said Dr Manish Kumar, president of the resident doctors’ association of the hospital.Health care workers said the closure of the borders had also hit Covid-19 testing facilities, which was a serious cause for concern.“The lockdown at the border means samples cannot be moved and our trained manpower is unable to report for work at this crucial time. I am working with around 20% of my staff, which has impacted the number of tests that we can do in a day. There shouldn’t be any borders in the National Capital Region, and such minor issues should not impact the government’s hard work of ramping up testing capability,” said Dr Navin Dang, founder, Dr Dang’s Labs.Delhi collects over 3,000 samples a day, but there have been several reports of results being delayed.Several Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) who work in Delhi also live in Faridabad, hampering on-ground services, including contact tracing and screening for Covid-19 in areas across the Capital, health officials said. “Many dispensaries are also not able to continue their immunisation services because ANMs working there are not able to cross the border,” said a Delhi government health official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/border-curbs-affect-health-care-services-testing-in-delhi/story-suWS5IJat8VpUBGbIiJNAJ.html
08-05-2020||Delhi||As Covid-19 cases mount in Delhi, more than 700 in home isolation||As many as 771 people, who have tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi but are displaying only mild symptoms have been placed under home isolation within a week of the government issuing guidelines in this matter, according to Delhi government data. This comes on the heels of Delhi recording more than 200 cases of Covid-19 each day for the past week, and over 400 cases a day on three occasions.For the ease of the patients, the government has also set up a consultation app that allows the dispensing of prescriptions. The government has designated 37 doctors for the service, which will be active between 8am and 8pm every day for Covid-19 patients to seek medical care.The national capital has recorded 5,980 cases of Covid-19 and 66 deaths as of Thursday, which also had Delhi’s largest single-day case spike, with 448 new cases. Of the 3,983 active cases till May 7, 1,358 were admitted with severe symptoms to the 10 designated Covid-19 hospitals. Another 1,230 people were admitted to either Covid Care Centres or Covid Health Centres with mild to moderate symptoms. Some people who are asymptomatic and are showing mild symptoms such as low-grade fever, headache, throat pain and don’t require oxygen support but cannot ensure isolation at home are admitted in Covid Care Centres.And 771 people have been placed under home isolation. “This is an effective alternative for a scenario where the government is unable to cope up with the number of cases. Even if 30% to 40% of the population gets the infection, it is impossible for any government to manage the numbers. Also, when people know they can stay at home even if they test positive, more will come forward to report their symptoms and get tested,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.To be sure, along with mild symptoms, only those with no comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, heart and kidney disease, are allowed to stay in home isolation. Comorbid conditions are known to increase the risk of developing severe symptoms of Covid-19.Even then, home isolation is only allowed if the patients have adequate facilities, such as a separate room and bathroom, for the positive person, and if the others in the family do not have severe comorbidities.According to the standard operating procedure for home isolation issued by the Delhi government, a two-member team of an accredited social health activist (ASHA) and auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM), or any other health care worker, visits the house of the patient on the first day of isolation to check symptoms and the isolation facility at home. The team carries a pulse-oxymeter to measure the oxygen saturation of the patient, a thermal scanner to measure the patient’s temperature, and 100gm bleaching powder for the family.The families are taught how to make 1% hypochlorite solution to clean various surfaces in the patient’s room, and how to disinfect masks before disposing of them.The patient also has to ensure that there is a family member who can provide 24x7 care, including food, cleaning of utensils, and other chores, without exposing others. The person has to wear mask and gloves when in the patient’s room.They caregiver also has to monitor the condition of the patient regularly and keep in touch with the district authorities to let them know if the patient develops symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, persistent pressure or pain in the chest, confusion, or bluish discolouration of lips or face. A team of privately hired staff actively checks with the family over the telephone for symptoms every day.The team visiting the Covid-19 patient -- they get  ₹100 for every household visited, an additional ₹200 for refreshments, and free commute -- stamps the left hand of the person stating ‘Committed to Home Isolation’ and pastes a sticker outside the house informing others of home isolation. The family and the teams all have to to download the Aarogya Setu app to monitoring that patients do not break isolation.“In the app, we have a facility to track the movement of the patient. Our teams often ask them to send a selfie just to ensure that they are in their rooms,” said a senior official.The patient is allowed to come out of isolation only after two of their tests are negative – for the first, the sample will be collected from home by private laboratories and, if negative, the person has to go to the nearest testing centre for the second sample collection.The big challenge, experts said, is handling the biomedical waste generated.“The waste generated from these households would be infected and cannot be disposed of as is with other general waste. The current guidelines do not talk of the biomedical waste management. The entire waste from the household will have to be treated as biomedical waste and can either be picked up by the bio-medical waste management agencies or provisions must be made for the waste to be dropped off at the nearest hospital or dispensary from where it can be collected,” said Dr Jugal Kishore.Currently, waste is collected separately from these houses by municipality collectors based on the list provided by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-cases-mount-in-capital-more-than-700-in-home-isolation/story-qT7hEciSFFWCquNOxGyJTM.html
08-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Two videos of assault emerge on social media, no case registered||Two videos of assault surfaced on the social media on Thursday. While one of the videos was from Azadpur Mandi, the location of the second video — in which a man is seen being assaulted with wooden and plastic batons by a man in a police uniform and two-three civilians — could not be conclusively determined till late Thursday night.In the Azadpur Mandi video, an injured man is seen bleeding on the footpath while another man — who is apparently making the video — can be heard alleging that the injured man was assaulted by a policeman at the Mandi. In the video, some people are also seen surrounding two men in uniform riding a bike. The person who is making the video can also be heard instigating the crowd by saying, “maaro-maaro, gira do (hit them, hit them, pull them down).”Deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya, however, denied that the man had been assaulted by a policemen. She said that a fight broke out between a customer and a civil defence volunteer deployed at the mandi over some issue on Tuesday.“The two later gave in writing that the issue between them had been resolved and they do not want any police action,” said Arya.According to the vendors at the Azadpur Mandi, the incident took place around 10pm on Tuesday, when the customer was making a purchase at a shop in the market. A minor argument ensued between a vendor and the customer, after which a civil defence volunteer intervened and allegedly beat up the customer.Anil Malhotra, member of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Azadpur, demanded strict action against the volunteer in question and also asked for increased police presence in the mandi to avoid such incidents.“If the authorities cannot handle the market, then they should just shut it down. But if you have decided to keep it open, then customers will come in and you cannot go on beating them like this,” Malhotra said.Adil Khan, chairperson of the APMC Azadpur, said that he was not aware of any such incident “We will take action against those who resort to violence against customers,” Khan said.In the second video, a policeman and at least two civilians are seen assaulting a man on a road while none of the passers-by, including the one filming the assault, come to his rescue.Though the exact reason behind the assault is not known, one of the passers-by can be heard saying that the man (who is being assaulted) was hugging people.The date and exact place where the incident took place is not known, but a couple of vehicles seen in the video have Delhi’s registration number plates.HT spoke to DCPs of West, Southwest and Dwarka districts. They said no such incident was reported tin any police stations in their respective districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-two-videos-of-assault-emerge-on-social-media-no-case-registered/story-gI8HaeZwgAPaEx5qhFyfxJ.html
08-05-2020||Chandigarh||Students of Chandigarh tricity living in PGs being coaxed to pay rent amid lockdown||With the curfew in Chandigarh tricity being extended amid increasing cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), students complain they are being asked to pay rent forcefully or vacate their paying guest accommodations. Most tenants who reside in such accommodations are outstation students are not living in their PGs currently as all educational institutes are closed.A ministry of home affairs order released on March 29 stated owners cannot ask for rent for a month, and in case of non-payment, a student cannot be evicted. However, there are no preceding instructions for April, adding to the confusion. UT adviser Manoj Parida said the Chandigarh administration will be writing to the centre for clear directions on the issue after which future course of action will be decided. Many students alleged that as they are unable to pay rent, landlords are forcing them to come back and take their belongings amid the lockdown.Last month, Chandigarh Police were approached by Kajal who said the landlord of her paying guest accommodation in Sector 22, Joginder Mahajan, a resident of sector 37, was forcing her to pay rent or leave. Following this, the station house officer of Sector 17 issued a warning to Mahajan.A similar case was witnessed in Mohali where Usha, a daily wager complained her PG owner, Harbir Singh, was forcing her to pay rent. He was booked under extortion, assault, criminal intimidation and forgery at Phase 8 police station.A student living at a PG in Phase 9, Mohali, said she pays ₹11,000 as monthly rent and is not in a position to continue paying till August, when she expects colleges to resume classes. A student living in a rented accommodation in Sector 11, Panchkula, said she was given an eviction notice and asked to vacate by the end of this month as her rest of the roommates had not pay their dues. They were paying ₹ 18,000 for three-BHK flat.Punjab University students’ forum has also raised the issue. They said many students are unable to afford rent during this hour of crisis, and requested for a waiver. Students of DAV College also raised the issue.Most tenants contacted by Hindustan Times requested anonymity fearing a harsh blowback from the landlords. A resident of Sector 19 said, “My landlord is forcing me to pay rent for two months. I paid half the rent thinking they are dependent on us. But, they are still forcing us to pay the entire amount otherwise and threatening to give us a month’s notice to leave the place.”Another girl living in a Sector 11 PG said, “Not everyone is in the financial condition to pay rent. We didn’t complain about the owner to the police as she will not let us live in peace later.”“When I told my landlord that I won’t be able to pay rent, he asked me to collect my belongings and leave. I am based in Delhi, how can I go back now with no transport available?” a student of DAV College said.Gaurav Sharma, a student leader from the same college said, “Many students said they are being forced to pay rent. Most of them are outstation students. They can’t come back and vacate the premises during this crisis. How will they arrange passes and transportation? Landlords should be more sensitive.”Ashok Nanda, a landlord said, “It is very sorry state of affairs for retired persons who were bearing household expenses through rents they were receiving. In general, tenants’ excuse for not paying rent is they have not got their salary. However, not all of them are telling the truth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/students-of-chandigarh-tricity-living-in-pgs-being-coaxed-to-pay-rent-amid-lockdown/story-WMymgRGluXViWFVnjJTuIP.html
08-05-2020||Noida||One help per household: RWAs come up with strategies as lockdown eases||With the Gaiutam Budh Nagar district administration putting the onus of formulating local guidelines on residential bodies, these associations Thursday came up with a set of guidelines to regulate the movement of people at housing societies.While the Gautam Budh Nagar administration had on Wednesday issued guidelines on interstate and interdistrict travel, opening of industries and private offices, and perimeter control of containment zones, it left it to the residents’ welfare associations to come up with guidelines to regulate the movement of helps, plumbers, electricians and others at housing societies.The district administration has suggested that the entry of plumbers, electricians and service personnel for ACs, ROs, refrigerators, etc. be limited to twice a week. The officials also said the RWA can decide in consultation with residents the entry of domestic helps, but stipulated that helps come only be from a non-containment zone and only one help per household will be allowed.Following the directives, RWAs started making plans for their individual localities after taking feedback from residents.“We have issued certain guidelines for now. It is difficult to keep one help restricted to a single household as they often work in multiple households. So we will try to prepare some sort of a roster for these helps and may have to get in touch with more helps to accommodate all families. However, it will be very difficult to track their movements once they leave the society. But we will monitor the situation till May 17 and then take a call depending on how thigs things pan out,” Rekha Chawla, secretary, apartment owners’ association (AOA), ATS village, Sector 93, said.Other localities are urging residents who require services of domestic helps to keep them on a 24-hour basis.“There are families who do require support of domestic helps. Almost 10% families in our housing society are elderly couples. Then there are those with young children or working people who have to worry about kids who aren’t going to school. Such people need help. We are asking them to make arrangements for the help to stay with them full time and to get them tested for Covid-19 first. For the staff, thermal screening will be done at the main gate,” Rajiva Singh, president, apartment owners’ association, Stellar Kings Court, Sector 50, said.He also said that for any maintenance service, the AOA have fixed two days of the week and the body will review the situation once more after May 17.Residents also said even though helps from only non-containment zones will be coming in, it is difficult to ensure that the guidelines are followed. Also, in high-rises with as many as 1,000 to 1500 flats, and many sectors the ‘one help per household’ rule is not feasible due to a large volume of residents.“We cannot fulfil this administrative requirement and that is why for now we are avoiding the entry of helps unless absolutely necessary. In that scenario, the family will have to engage her from 7am-7pm and get her checked for Covid-19. Meanwhile, we have permitted car cleaners, laundry personnel and gardeners to come in. The RWA has engaged its own plumber and electrician who are servicing the houses for now. We are ensuring that all service personnel are from non-containment zones,” colonel (retd) Shashi Vaid, chairman, Arun Vihar RWA, said.But RWAs are worries about conflicts with residents.“In case we make a rule, we don’t want people to say that we are being autocratic. So we have asked residents for their feedback. So far most residents have refused to engage a help until the situation improves,” the estate manager of a society in Sector 75 said.“If any conflict leads to a disturbance of peace or gets out of hand, police will intervene. However, any policy disagreements can be settled between the RWAs and residents amicably,” Sriparna Gangoulee, additional commissioner of police, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/one-help-per-household-rwas-come-up-with-strategies-as-lockdown-eases/story-lgRmyUSrySJxiDfGMCvDUK.html

08-05-2020||Pune||Uphill task to complete projects: Pune developers||While Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (Maha-Rera) in its order dated April 2 extended the completion deadline for registered projects by three months, the city developers were expecting a one year’s extension. They said that shortage of manpower and raw material and less cash flow is hampering the ongoing projects.The order, issued on April 2, stated that all Maha-Rera-registered projects whose completion or revised completion or extended completion expires on March 20, 2020, has been given an extension of three months. Pune district administration allowed commencement of construction work from May 4.Suhas Merchant, president, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai), said, “We were expecting one-year extension as despite government’s decision to allow commencement of work at under-construction sites, developers are facing multiple problems, including financial strain and inadequate cash flow.”Credai undertook a survey this week among 216 real estate developers to identify the key reasons for not being able to restart the construction work in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) regions.“The survey indicated that majority of developers are facing problems like unavailability of construction material, especially the material related to pre-monsoon construction work; difficulties in construction material reaching the sites; problems faced by technical staff and site engineers in reaching the construction sites,” said Merchant.“There is a state of confusion in the minds of the labour force at the construction sites. They want to return to their hometowns because of less work opportunity here and it is hampering projects”, said Merchant.The Credai chief pointed out that it is important to speed up the process of solving these problems because of less time in hand to complete the pre-monsoon work. “Site work for basement, retaining wall, underground work, waterproofing cannot start without consultants and the technical staff, including special work supervisors, need to present at sites.“Many labourers have left for their hometowns due to lack of work. So, if we do not start the work right now, the few labourers who are here will also leave and it will further delay the projects,” he said.Rohit Gera, managing director, Gera Constructions, said, “Though Maha-Rera has given an extension, the situation on the ground is different as lockdown is still in place. We will know the impact on real estate when we have full labour on-site and adequate supply of raw materials.”“The situation right now is that we have only 50 per cent of the labourers on-site, with many wanting to return to their villages, therefore affecting the projects. I am hopeful that even in these difficult times, Rera will stand by the developers and address problems judiciously,” said Gera.Gautam Chatterjee, chairman, Maha-Rera, said, “Due to the current situation, real estate projects across Maharashtra will take some time to resume. Recognising this, RBI has also allowed banks to provide a three-month moratorium on fixed-term loans and EMI payments.”“Therefore, in order to aid government efforts in controlling the damage of Covid-19 and ensure that completion of Maha-Rera registered projects does not get adversely affected, it has been decided to issue the order (extension order),” he said.Findings of survey undertaken by CredaiCredai undertook a survey this week among 216 real estate developers to identify the key reasons for not being able to restart the construction work in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) regions-Together, they have only 45,700 labourers at the site (in-situ)-Based on the survey, over 46% of labour will leave for hometowns as they have no work- Less than 20% of the staff was able to reach the site due to confusion/unavailability of e-pass / harassment by police.- About 90% of developers need material on site to begin work (pre-monsoon preparations)-Less than 10% of developers have been able to receive any material on site in the last few days- Almost 50% of developers (105 out of 216) have less than 100 labourers available at the site-Less than 3% of developers have more than 1,000 labourers at all their on-going sitesDue to the lack of petrol, many site staff, consultant staff (for checking) and contractor staff cannot come to work- Inter-district travel is currently not being allowed. Many senior engineers had travelled to hometown just before lockdown and they need to get back to Pune- One-time permission to move specific labourers required for pre-monsoon works- Gram panchayat and police are asking for health check-ups of labourers because of which they want to return to their villages- Ready mix concrete(RMC) plants are shut and hence, concretisation is not possible at several places- Safety/hygiene material is not coming to the site and hence, facing difficulty in implementing guidelines- Banks have stopped disbursements, so cash flow is a challenge||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/uphill-task-to-complete-projects-pune-developers/story-NIF3k0wVQEDCrNN5AQRq4O.html
08-05-2020||Pune||First special train for stranded migrant labourers departs from Pune to Rewa||The first special Shramik train from Pune for stranded migrant workers ran from Urli railway station, under the Pune railway division, on Thursday evening. The train scheduled at 5pm left the station at 6.40pm for Rewa railway station in Madhya Pradesh. The train carrying 1,173 passengers will reach the destination on Friday at 11 am. Rewa is 400 km northeast of Bhopal, the state’s capital.Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram and Pune rural police superintendent Sandeep Patil flagged-off the train.Migrant workers from across Pune district who had registered for going back to their native villages were brought in private and Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) buses to Urli railway station, 50km from Pune railway station.They were first accommodated in classrooms of Mahatma Gandhi Vidyalaya School located opposite to the railway station, before being brought to the station in a line. The passengers included labourers, children, women and the elderly.Railway Protection Force (RPF), Government Railway Police (GRP), Pune rural police and State Reserve Police Force ensured that the passengers maintained social distancing norms while entering the platform number one of the station. Aadhaar card and body temperature of each passenger was checked before being allowed to go to respective coaches.The train journey time is 18 hours and will run on end-to-end basis and there will be no commercial halt en route. The train has seating capacity of 1,100 passengers with coach having a capacity of 72 seats, but only 54 passengers were allowed in each coach as per social distancing norms. The meals for Thursday night were given by the Maharashtra state government while breakfast for Friday will be given by the railways.Rajesh Hiralal Saket, who is travelling with his group of nine family members, said, “We were working in a company at Ranjangaon MIDC and had registered to go back. Today morning we got a call to be prepared for train journey and at 11am buses came to pick us up. We are from Narayani village in Rewa district and the last two months were very difficult for us to survive. I will never come back to Pune now and seek job in a nearby village.”Budha Sen, who was travelling with his wife and five-year-old son, said, “We were happy to get the call about our travel arrangements. I know life will be hard back in the village, but it was getting difficult to find livelihood in Pune. With no work and no income, we had to depend on NGOs and private organisations for food every day.”Ram said, “We are happy that we could send people back to their hometowns with proper safety measures. All our officials, Pune railway division, police department and other departments put in a lot of effort to make it a success. We will send all those stranded people who are willing to go back to their native places by all possible transport modes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/first-special-train-for-stranded-migrant-labourers-departs-from-pune-to-rewa/story-ksxxc7Kikisr9luZCQJpyL.html

The order came two days after the Pune police had allowed five shops of non-essential goods per lane to open between 10am and 6pm. The Pune district collector also issued a separate order allowing supply of petrol and diesel in non-containment areas to residents without asking for passes.“Passes are checked for vehicle movement from containment to non-containment zone and vice-versa. Within non-containment zones, passes are not required. The relaxations are also for non-essential and non-exempted categories,” said Bachchan Singh, deputy commissioner of police, crime, Pune.The exempted categories and essential services did not require police pass even before.The police order had mentioned that five shops of non-essential goods per lane be opened between 10am and 6pm. However, an order by PMC, which supersedes the police order, stated that the shops be allowed to open between 7am and 7pm.Police passes given on Tuesday and Wednesday: 6,200Passes given till 11am on Thursday:440- death of relative, friend1,584- medical emergencies3,259- stranded students295- other reasonsPending passes199- death of relative, friend1,600- medical emergencies2,135- stranded students||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/unchecked-vehicle-movement-seen-in-areas-across-pune/story-0UnePCgvdlIw89ZNZz9csO.html

However, in these times of Covid-19 and the lockdown, they are required to keep awake the entire night for their duty at the police check-post (naka bandi) in Bhor taluka.In view of the shortfall in police manpower, primary teachers have been appointed for bandobast duty in many parts of rural Pune.Sudam Ombale, the Bhor taluka teachers association president, said, “Around 335 teachers have been appointed on check-post duty and a total of 32 check-posts have been erected on roads in Bhor taluka. We are receiving good support from officials, but it is a fact that in remote areas, people are facing some problems. Teachers did not get safety equipment and on their own have been purchasing sanitisers and masks. At some places, there is the issue of safety at night.”Vishal Tanpure, block development officer (BDO) from Bhor, said, “It is true that teachers have been assigned the role of policing. As there is limited manpower with the police, we have decided to depute teachers and this practice is getting followed all over Maharashtra. Earlier, we tried to give support of the home guards to teachers, but home guards too have less manpower and now only teachers are doing the policing work. As Bhor is close to Pune, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is huge reverse migration and a total of 22,000 people from Mumbai and Pune returned to Bhor taluka as cases increased in both the cities.”Bhagwan who has been appointed at Kusgaon in Bhor taluka of Pune district, said, “This is a totally different experience for us. We have done census enumeration work and we have been on election duty and other kinds of work. But this is the first time that we are doing the work of policemen and that too on night duty.”Bhagwan, who has been given the responsibility of the check-post in Kusgaon, said, “The locals follow the instructions, but outsiders get into arguments and try to clear the check-post without a valid pass. Some of them argue with us saying we have no authority to stop them as we are not policemen.”The teachers work in three shifts and every teacher has to do night duty by rotation. Two of them stay awake the entire night to man the check-posts.“We have managed the chairs and the bamboos on our own to barricade the road. We enter the number of each vehicle passing by this road in a register and check whether they have a valid pass or not,” Bhagwan said.Appa Sawant, a teacher from Bhor taluka, said he has done night patrolling and survey and supervision of people during the quarantine. “This is a completely different kind of work. The government should ideally put revenue staff like talathi or people from some other department with authority along with us teachers as people don’t listen to us,” Sawant said.“To put teachers on road duty is not right,” he said, while adding that there were no complaints about this given the extraordinary circumstances caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The check-post is absolutely bare with basic provisions and the villagers are also not assisting in any way due to the lockdown, one teacher said. Since Bhor taluka is close to Pune city, many people have been trying to go to their villages to be away from the city. When stopped at the check-post, they get into heated arguments, said Sawant. He noted that at some check-posts there was no power supply and the teachers were sitting in the dark the entire night.A teacher who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said, “Our check-post is in an isolated location and two of us are manning it. When some people get into a heated argument, we just take down the number of their vehicle and allow them to pass by.”He said that in some villages, there was resistance to allowing people from Pune and Mumbai to return home and the police was at once informed of their presence. They are then asked to stay in isolation, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/primary-school-teachers-man-police-check-posts-in-rural-pune/story-MWCOl7yf97l9xW6rfe3uuK.html
08-05-2020||Pune||Non-essential shops open in Pune; some remain shut as per trade association’s stand||Many non-essential shops opened on Thursday following the notification by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), while some remained closed as per the decision of the traders’ body.Pune Vyapari Mahasangh, the traders’ body, in its meeting on Wednesday night decided to wait for a few more days to open shops as most of its members hail from containment zones.Shops selling cloth, hardware and construction material were open in areas like Aundh, Baner, Kondhwa, Hadapsar, Warje and Camp, even as those located in the central parts of the city like Deccan, Navi peth, Shivajinagar, and Kothrud, Satara road and Bopodi remained closed.Shekhar Gaikwad, Pune municipal commissioner, on Wednesday, allowed non-essential standalone shops to open between 7am and 7pm in non-containment zones. In his order, Gaikwad allowed shops involved in selling and repair of electronic gadgets and mobile phones to be opened on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, while hardware, plumbing, construction and cloth stores along with vehicle garages to function on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.Many shop owners who did not open their business establishments cited confusion regarding the orders issued by the PMC and the appeal made by Pune Vyapari Mahasangh.Fattechand Ranka, president, Pune Vyapari Mahasangh, said, “Our staffers who work for these shops located in the central parts of city have to travel from containment zones. We have decided to remain shut as part of our help to the government.”Besides non-essential shops, vegetable and grocery stores also extended their timing of doing business after clarity from the PMC, which allowed these establishments to remain open for 12 hours from 7am. Huge crowd was seen at petrol pumps after Wednesday’s order by district collector Naval Kishore Ram allowing sale of fuel to everyone.DMart at Aundh, which had downed its shutters after a staff was tested positive, opened its doors on Thursday.Rupesh Junawane, resident of Aundh, said, “While many shops are opening, we request at least the libraries to open as it will keep the elders and children occupied.”At Satara road, most shops except grocery stores were closed while on Bhau Patil road at Bopodi, almost all shops, barring medical stores, were shut. The only shop that was open was Rajan Coffee, a shop that specialises in south Indian grocery items.Bhavesh Kumar Parit, who runs a laundry in Kothrud, said, “We have been shut for more than 40 days and now if we don’t open, it will adversely affect our business. Hence, we decided to open the shop after the PMC’s permission.”At some places in the eastern parts of city, shopkeepers said they had to shut business by 12 noon as policemen turned up asking the establishments to shut operations before the 2pm deadline. “In Kothrud where I live, all non-essential shops were closed and even the supermarket selling grocery was shut down post noon by the police,” said Sneha Gore, professor. Pune police chief K Venkatesham said that police are allowing shops to carry out business with all guidelines being followed. “Field staff has been intimated about the orders by municipal commissioner and district collector. Request social distance and personal hygiene measures,” tweeted Venkatesham. The locals, however, differed. “When the policemen are asking us to shut down before deadline, we are confused over what orders are being issued and what is actually being implemented on ground. We want more confidence-building measures from the government through which we can open shops and conduct business. We want support from the government which will boost the confidence of traders doing business in green zones,” said Amit Prajapati, a super shoppe proprietor from Vimannagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/non-essential-shops-open-in-pune-some-remain-shut-as-per-trade-association-s-stand/story-K9APjz9nHxyLYi0Fy5yj6J.html

08-05-2020||World||UK minister warns no big changes to coronavirus lockdown||The British government warned the public on Friday not to expect any major changes to the nationwide coronavirus lockdown next week, as the official daily death toll topped 31,000.Britain has lost more people to Covid -19 than any other European country, but there is growing pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ease stay-at-home orders imposed in late March.The devolved government in Wales on Friday unveiled plans to re-open garden centres and libraries, but said the wider lockdown would remain for another three weeks.Johnson is due to announce his own plans for England in a televised address on Sunday evening, but one of his top ministers made clear Friday there would be no big changes.“We have to be realistic that there isn’t going to be any dramatic overnight change,” Environment Secretary George Eustice told the daily media briefing.“We will be very, very cautious as we loosen the restrictions we have, as the data that we’re outlining on a daily basis shows we are not out of the woods. “There are still major challenges.“We will be living with this virus for some time to come and it’s therefore important to avoid that second peak that could overwhelm our National Health Service.”He said deaths among patients in hospitals, care homes and the wider community who tested positive for coronavirus rose by 626 on the previous day to 31,241.A six-week old baby with an underlying health condition was among the new deaths recorded in England, according to the state-run National Health Service (NHS).The true death toll is expected to be higher, as Britain has only recently ramped up its ability to test people for Covid -19.Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published on Tuesday, which has a lag of up to two weeks, showed more than 32,000 deaths with coronavirus on the death certificate.Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford announced “modest adjustments” from Monday, with people allowed to exercise outside their homes more than once a day, while staying local.Garden centres will re-open if they can prove they can keep people a safe distance apart, and local authorities will begin planning how to open libraries and municipal recycling centres.Responsibility for virus measures in the United Kingdom is devolved to its four nations -- England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland -- but so far they have all moved in lockstep.In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Friday said the lockdown would remain in place, although she plans to allow people to take more outdoor exercise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-minister-warns-no-big-changes-to-coronavirus-lockdown/story-SwPVlvpVktPngTspOEYNRN.html
08-05-2020||World||US, China trade officials press ahead with ‘Phase 1’ deal after overnight call||Top US and Chinese trade representatives played down deep differences over the economic wreckage of the coronavirus pandemic and said they would press ahead with implementing their “Phase 1” trade deal after an overnight phone call.US President Donald Trump, critical of China’s early handling of the coronavirus outbreak in the city of Wuhan in late 2019, told Fox News Channel on Friday that he was “very torn” about whether to end the trade deal.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer discussed the deal with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on the phone call. The US officials said in a joint statement that both sides agreed the obligations would be met.China’s Commerce Ministry said the two sides agreed to improve the atmosphere for implementation of the trade deal, which calls for Beijing to boost its purchases of American farm and manufactured goods, energy and services by $200 billion over two years compared to a 2017 baseline.While China has made some purchases, some observers say these are running far behind the pace needed to meet the first-year goal of a $77 billion increase as China’s economy is just now beginning to recover from shutdowns imposed during the pandemic. On the call, the two sides “agreed that in spite of the current global health emergency, both countries fully expect to meet their obligations under the agreement in a timely manner,” Lighthizer and Mnuchin said in their statement.FEELING DIFFERENTLYTrump and other top officials have blamed China for the deaths of hundreds of thousands from the outbreak and have threatened punitive action, including possible tariffs and shifting supply chains away from China.Trump has said he would terminate the trade deal if China fails to meet its purchase commitments. He said on Wednesday that he would know within a week or two whether that was possible.The US statement suggested that more time may be needed and that the two sides would continue calls on a “regular basis.”Calling into Fox News Channel just before the Labor Department announced that 20.5 million non-farm jobs were lost during April amid coronavirus business closures, Trump said the overnight phone call indicated that the deal “moves along.”But he said that while he was initially “very excited” about the trade deal, the pandemic had changed his views about it.“Look, I feel differently than I did. I was the most - I was very tough with China. They have to buy $250 billion worth of product, et cetera, et cetera,” Trump said.Asked if he was “breaking up” the Phase 1 trade deal, Trump said: “I’m very - I’m very torn as to - I have not decided yet, if you want to know the truth.”The US-China Business Council, which represents US companies doing business in China, said it was too soon to assess China’s compliance with the trade deal, given that it only took effect on Feb. 15 as a global health crisis was unfolding.“It would be extremely destabilizing if the president pulled out of the agreement without giving the Chinese a chance to meet their commitments,” USCBC president Craig Allen said in a statement. “So far, China seems to be operating in good faith and has sought no modifications to its purchase commitments despite its ability to request them.”A clause in the agreement allows for either party to seek consultations in the event a natural disaster or other unforeseen circumstances prevent compliance. The clause has not been invoked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-trade-officials-press-ahead-with-phase-1-deal-after-overnight-call/story-eyVJLAgPiEHH6hhp88tvYL.html
08-05-2020||World||Shortages of coronavirus test materials ‘critical’: UN lab chief||Shortages of materials needed in tests for the novel coronavirus remain “critical”, according to the head of a UN lab, which is supplying countries with Covid-19 detection kits.In particular the chemical reagents for the tests are still in short supply, said Giovanni Cattoli, head of the Animal Production and Health Laboratory run jointly by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).“There is indeed on the global market a shortage of some items, particularly reagents, because there are demands from all over the world,” Cattoli told AFP this week during a tour of the laboratory at Seibersdorf, 40 kilometres (25 miles) outside Vienna.“The situation is still critical,” he said. “We are working... to accelerate purchase and investigate if there are alternative reagents.”The tests the lab sends out use the nuclear-derived RT-PCR technology, which is now common for new coronavirus detection and can give results within hours.Cattoli said one of the lessons of the crisis was “that we need not to rely only on a single type of test but to have a portfolio of tests and a portfolio of reagents in order to be prepared to have a plan B and possibly a plan C in order to respond effectively and rapidly.”The IAEA has received requests from 119 member states for test equipment to supply more than 200 laboratories, Cattoli added. Of them, 18 have already received supplies with more on the way. The costs of each package of equipment -- some 100,000 euros ($108,000) -- are borne by the IAEA.“Some laboratories in some areas of the world don’t have the necessary equipment. They don’t have the necessary reagents and procedures to rapidly detect the virus,” Cattoli said.Those who have received equipment are Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burkina Faso, Iran, Kenya, Latvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Malaysia, Montenegro, Morocco, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Peru, Philippines, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Togo.The IAEA Laboratories in Seibersdorf are the only ones of their kind operated by the UN in the world.They cooperate with the FAO and others to monitor the evolution of the novel coronavirus and other viruses.They also work on improvements to RT-PCR technology, which may enable it to be used outside laboratories in the future, Cattoli said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shortages-of-coronavirus-test-materials-critical-un-lab-chief/story-0bWAMdJqgj6bkYtwlUKUSO.html
08-05-2020||World||US job losses shoot up to record 14.7% in April||Unemployment in the United States climbed to a record 14.7% in April, the month the Covid-19 pandemic peaked forcing state and local governments around the country to shut down all but essential services. An unprecedented 20.5 million people were left jobless that month, according to new data released Friday.It’s been the worst since World War II, a grim milestone as the world celebrated VE Day to commemorate the surrender of Nazi forces in Europe on May 8, 1945. The previous record of job losses 10.4%, was all the way back in 1948, more than half a century ago; and it’s the steepest monthly drop since 1939.An estimated 33.5 million people have filed for unemployments benefits in the past six weeks since the lockdowns went into effect mid-March, according to weekly data released Thursday; the peak was 6.9 million in late March.“Today’s report reflects the massive impact that measures to contain the coronavirus have had on the American workforce,” Eugene Scalia, the US labour secretary said in a statement. “This employment situation is exceptionally fluid. We know that today’s data reflect neither the additional layoffs that occurred in late April and early May, nor the employees beginning to return to work in some States. We also know that, by re-opening safely, we have the capacity to avoid permanent job losses for the overwhelming percent of Americans who, the report shows, currently view their job loss as temporary.”President Donald Trump tried to strike a positive note, saying the economy will bounce back. “Those jobs will all be back and they’ll be back very soon,” he said in an interview to Fox News, slipping on his cheerleader hat, as he has often said he does. He added the next year will be “a phenomenal year”.Unemployment numbers stood at 3.5% in February, a half-century low. The economy was booming and the president had hoped to ride it to a second term. He called the collapse “artificial” as he has sought before to make it clear he is not responsible for it.The US has pumped in trillions of dollars into the economy to bail out businesses hit by the lockdown and help them keep as many employees on their rolls as they can. And direct payments have been made to American families below a certain income level and unemployments benefits have been increased substantially to alleviate their situation.And as the number of new infections have have continued to drop and as have those for hospitalization and intubation (patients put on ventilators), most states have either eased restrictions, or have announced plans, and allowed certain businesses and establishments to reopen, under strict observance of social distancing rules.But experts have warned of a resurgence in fatalities because of the easing and one widely cited research model has projected more than 134,000 deaths by August 4.Fatalities went up by 2.231 in the last 24 hours to 75,670 Friday morning and the number of confirmed and reported infections increased by 28,420 to 1.25 million. The number of single-day deaths had dropped considerably but have since rebounded, posting another 2,000-plus toll.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-job-losses-shoot-up-to-record-14-7-in-april/story-6or02LkPeBbV7CHa6CXlDN.html

North Korea cited a military exercise by the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) Air Combat Command on Wednesday, and said the drills violated inter-Korean agreements aimed at reducing military tensions.“Everything is now going back to the starting point before the north-south summit meeting in 2018,” the statement said.On Sunday, South Korea said North Korean troops fired multiple shots toward a South Korean guard post at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which separates the two countries.South Korean troops responded by firing warning shots, but no casualties were reported.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had said the shots fired by North Korea were likely “accidental”.In a separate dispatch, KCNA said Kim sent a verbal message to the Chinese president about the coronavirus, KCNA said.“Kim Jong Un in his message extended his warm greetings to Xi Jinping and congratulated him, highly appreciating that he is seizing a chance of victory in the war against the unprecedented epidemic,” said KCNA.Kim wished Xi good health and the KCNA report said the relations between Pyongyang and Beijing were “firmly consolidated.Asked about Kim’s message to Xi during a daily briefing in Beijing on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China and North Korea are friendly neighbours and in close communication on Covid-19 epidemic control. She said she had nothing to update with in response to a question on whether Xi will send a reply to Kim.Covid-19 is the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. North Korea has said it has no cases of the coronavirus, but previously reinforced border checks and anti-epidemic measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-lashes-out-at-south-korean-military-drills-sends-greetings-to-china/story-m6HraJAOn9iWSwtk0lfe2I.html

Had they been listed properly, the unemployment rate would have been nearly five percentage points higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-destroys-20-5-mn-us-jobs-in-april-in-historic-collapse/story-eYyKtSMVS0N2bhGaZdHsEM.html
08-05-2020||World||China supports WHO-led review of pandemic after it is over, says foreign ministry||China supports a World Health Organisation (WHO)-led review into the coronavirus pandemic after it is declared over, the foreign ministry said on Thursday.The review should be conducted in an “open, transparent and inclusive manner” under the leadership of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying said at the regular ministry briefing on Friday.Hua’s comments come in the backdrop of increasing global pressure to allow an international probe into the origins of the pandemic and the novel coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageChina has dismissed US allegations that the virus came from a laboratory.More than 3.8 million have been sickened in the Covid-19 pandemic and over 268000 have died.The epidemic situation in China has improved dramatically with the government having lowered risk levels for the country on Thursday; daily cases are in low single digits.Hua said the enquiry should be carried out an “appropriate time after the pandemic is over”.It should also be based on the protocols of the International Health Regulations, and be authorised by the World Health Assembly or Executive Committee - the WHO’s dual governing bodies.Countries including the US and Australia have called for an international probe into the origins of the pathogen and others like the UK and Germany have urged greater transparency from China.Until now, China has rejected similar calls for an investigation, accusing the US of “politicising the issue”.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has claimed that the US has evidence that the virus originated from a high-security lab in Wuhan.“We have asked him several times: where is the evidence? Take it out if you have it,” spokesperson Hua said at Friday’s briefing.“We have stated the facts many times, but Pompeo still repeatedly smears and attacks China on the issue. We are forced to expose the US according to public information and media reports,” Hua said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-supports-who-led-review-of-pandemic-after-it-is-over-says-foreign-ministry/story-y4Bw5xtLHggF8adFTBZvoK.html

A German intelligence report cast doubts on their accusation.Some 3.86 million people have been reported to be infected around the world and 268,620 have died, according to Reuters tally.Responding to Australia’s efforts to establish support for an international inquiry, France and Britain have said their focus is fighting the virus, not apportioning blame.Trump has been fiercely critical of China and the World Health Organization and has announced the United States will withdraw funding from the U.N. agency.Many scientists and politicians say now is the time to increase, not cut, funding to the WHO so that it can help find a vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-open-to-probe-of-origins-of-coronavirus-says-envoy-report/story-euVsGFySZalsC0jUpJu3EM.html
08-05-2020||World||Indian soldiers remembered as UK marks Victory in Europe Day||An aerobatics team of the Royal Air Force joined a series of events on Friday to mark Victory in Europe Day (VE Day) – May 8, 1945 – when fighting against Nazi Germany in Europe came to an end in World War II that involved millions of soldiers from colonial India.It was on this day 75 years ago that Prime Minister Winston Churchill announced on the radio at 3 pm that the war in Europe had come to an end, following Germany’s surrender on the previous day. A two-minute silence was observed across the UK on Friday morning.As the royal family and the Prime Minister Boris Johnson led tributes while maintaining social distancing due to the coronavirus pandemic, many recalled the contribution of Indians, such as iconic spy Noor Inayat Khan and the erstwhile Women’s Royal Indian Naval Service (WRINS).The ‘Wrins’, as they were known, mostly included Indian women. It was formed in 1942, and went on to become an intrinsic part of the British defence forces. They were assigned specialist tasks, such as top secret decoding, clerical duties, training in gunnery tactics.Johnson said: “Seventy-five years ago today, the people of this country celebrated victory against Hitler’s aggression. This country triumphed thanks to the heroism of countless ordinary people, and because of this, hundreds of millions of people now live in peace and freedom today”.“Today we must celebrate their achievement, and we remember their sacrifice. We are a free people because of everything our veterans did - we offer our gratitude, our heartfelt thanks and our solemn pledge: you will always be remembered.”At 3 pm on Friday, extracts from Churchill’s victory speech were scheduled to be broadcast across television and radio to recreate the moment the end of the war was announced.

That lull ended when official media showed a smiling Kim appearing at a May 1 ribbon-cutting event to open a new fertilizer factory, wearing a Mao suit and being greeted by the cheers of workers.The health of North Korea’s leader is one of the most closely guarded secrets in the country, only known by a few people in the inner circle. While North Korea’s state media almost never speaks on the subject, a prolonged absence can lead to speculation in the outside world.Reuters reported last month, citing people familiar with the matter, that China had sent a medical team to North Korea to advise on Kim. North Korea state media has made no allusions to Kim’s health, but the Seoul-based JoongAng Daily newspaper separately reported that the North Korean leader had been in self-quarantine after one of his bodyguards was confirmed with a coronavirus infection.In a separate North Korean media report Friday, a spokesman for North Korea’s armed forces called a South Korean military drill set for this week “reckless” and a “provocation.” Pyongyang has often used such exercises as a pretense for its own military displays.The comment came after Seoul accused North Korean troops Sunday of firing on South Korean personnel in the demilitarized zone that divides the two countries. South Korea said the action violated a 2018 military agreement between President Moon Jae-in and Kim to suspend hostile actions that could prompt conflict.Beijing has for decades worried about leadership instability in nuclear-armed North Korea that could ignite a humanitarian crisis on its border, or even a collapse of the regime. That would open the door to the emergence of a unified Korea supported by the U.S.No Cases?The stability of impoverished North Korea concerns not only China and its other immediate neighbors, but the world. A power vacuum would raise questions about who controls its estimated stockpile of enough fissile material for as many as 60 nuclear bombs and hundreds of missiles capable of delivering an atomic payload.Despite being between China -- the original epicenter of the virus outbreak -- and South Korea, which briefly was one of the hardest-hit countries, North Korea has said it hasn’t had any confirmed cases of Covid-19. Some including the commander of U.S. Forces Korea have expressed doubts about that claim.China and South Korea have both seen dramatic falls in new infections over the past several weeks and are starting to re-open their economies after massive efforts to contain the virus. North Korea is one of the world’s poorest countries and its antiquated medical system could be overwhelmed by a severe Covid-19 outbreak.North Korea’s KCNA on Friday said that preventive measures are being taken in all regions “against the widespread malignant virus infection that comes to be a world disaster,” adding the country is stockpiling materials for anti-epidemic efforts and working to develop a vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-lauds-china-s-virus-actions-wishes-xi-good-health/story-Gyhmk85s0toex7hu82k4OI.html

The city in the northern Lombardy region is the epicentre of Italy’s outbreak, one of the worst in Europe in terms of deaths and infections.More than 80,000 infections have been recorded in Lombardy -- almost 40 percent of Italy’s overall cases -- according to official data. Only 33,000 of Lombardy’s cases are considered recovered. The region’s capital Milan, is “a bit of a bomb,” said Massimo Galli, the head of the infectious diseases department at the renowned Sacco hospital in Milan.“We have a very high number of infected people returning to circulation,” he said in an interview with the Repubblica newspaper, referring to the easing of lockdown measures on May 4. Photographs of youngsters sitting along Milan’s canals enjoying aperitifs in the sunshine, many without wearing masks or respecting social distances rules, were splashed over the front pages of Italy’s main dailies Friday.Galli said it was clear the easing of the lockdown “may present problems”.Milan’s Mayor Giuseppe Sala slammed the canal-side behaviour as “shameful” and threatened to close the well-known aperitif area if people persist in flouting the rules.Lombardy has logged some 15,000 deaths, around half of Italy’s 30,000 coronavirus fatalities, since the outbreak first erupted in early March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-s-milan-a-ticking-coronavirus-bomb-report/story-0xZi98Vpky3Kzl9qIjCYtJ.html
08-05-2020||World||Wuhan market had role in coronavirus outbreak, but more research needed: WHO||A wholesale market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan played a role in the outbreak of the novel coronavirus last year, as the source or possibly as an “amplifying setting”, the World Health Organization said on Friday, calling for more research.Chinese authorities shut down the market in January as part of efforts to halt the spread of the virus and ordered a temporary ban on trade and consumption of wildlife. “The market played a role in the event, that’s clear. But what role we don’t know, whether it was the source or amplifying setting or just a coincidence that some cases were detected in and around that market,” said Dr Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO expert on food safety and zoonotic viruses that cross the species barrier from animals to humans.It was not clear whether live animals or infected vendors or shoppers may have brought the virus into the market, he told a Geneva news briefing. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said there is “a significant amount of evidence” the virus came from the Wuhan laboratory, although he has also said there wasn’t certainty. No public evidence has linked the outbreak to the lab in Wuhan and scientists have said the coronavirus appears to have developed in nature. A German intelligence report cast doubts on Pompeo’s allegations, Der Spiegel reported. Ben Embarek did not address the accusations. He noted that it took researchers a year to identify camels as the source of the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) virus, a coronavirus that emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread in the Middle East, adding: “It’s not too late.” “What is important, what would be of great help, is to get hold of the virus before it adapted to humans, before the version we have now. Because then we would better understand how it adapted to humans, how it evolved,” he said.“In terms of investigations, China has most probably, most likely, all the expertise needed to do these investigations. They have lot of very qualified researchers to that,” he said.A common sight across Asia, wet markets traditionally sell fresh produce and live animals, such as fish, in the open air. Many markets worldwide that sell live animals must be better regulated and hygiene conditions improved, and some should be closed down, Ben Embarek said. “But the vast majority can be fixed, can be better organised.”It is often a question of controlling waste management, the movement of people and goods, and of separating live animals from animal products and from fresh goods, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-market-had-role-in-coronavirus-outbreak-but-more-research-needed-who/story-WfWt4rXFVPehjduOPKjrQO.html

08-05-2020||World||Early Covid lockdown in China could have reduced cases: Study||Coronavirus cases in China could have been “dramatically reduced” if the government had locked down the first outbreak epicentre Wuhan, restricted inter-provincial travel and banned public gatherings one-to-three weeks before it did on January 23, a new international research paper has said.Published in the science journal Nature, this week, the researchers said – in a rare argument based on a mathematical model -- that earlier implementation of “non-pharmaceutical interventions” (NPIs) could have also reduced the “geographical range of the outbreak”.Conversely, a delay – later than January 23 -- could have made the outbreak far worse, they said.If the lockdowns and closing down of public places were not carried out by the time they were done, infections could have increased 67 times to 7.7 million in the country by February. Beijing has so far aggressively argued that it was the unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan -- where the coronavirus first emerged late last year – and then of the province Hubei not only curbed the Covid-19 spread in China but also gave the rest of the world a wider window of time to prepare for the eventual pandemic.The new paper compiled by researchers from University of Southampton in th UK, Fudan University and Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in China and the US’s Harvard Medical School and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health indicates the scenario if the those measures were taken earlier.The researchers took February 29 as the base date when they estimated that the number of Covid-19 cases in China were 114325 – the official number was close to 80000.From January 23, three major groups of NPIs were implemented to contain the spread of the outbreak in China: First, inter-city travel restrictions were put in place; second was the early identification and isolation of cases and lastly, contact restrictions and social distancing measures, together with personal preventive actions, such as hand washing, were implemented to reduce the community-level exposure risk, the researchers said.If these interventions in China could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier, cases could have been dramatically reduced by 66 percent, 86 percent or 95 percent respectively, they wrote.“The geographical range of affected areas would also shrink from 308 cities to 192, 130, and 61 cities, respectively”.“Earlier implementation of NPIs could have significantly reduced the magnitude and geographical range of the outbreak, but equally, a delayed response would have led to a larger outbreak,” the researchers said.Lai Shengjie, one of the researchers involved in creating the model, said it was difficult for China to implement the NPIs before as not much was known about the pathogen initially.“This is just a theoretical estimate from model, but without considering the impact of actual socioeconomic factors and the capacity of identifying this novel virus at the early stage of the outbreak. Considering that this is totally a new pathogen, it did need time to collect evidence and identify viruses, and isolate viruses in the early stage of an outbreak,” Lai, a research fellow ongeography and environmental science at the University of Southampton, told HT over email.“I would like to say that China’s actions to lockdown a 11-million population city within two weeks after isolating the virus was very commendable. Because at that time, the necessity of such measures was still suspect, because the relevant evidence is still very limited, but now similar interventions have been widely adopted,” Lai said.The study indicated that early detection and isolation did more to curb the contagion than the other two NPIs, but all three combined interventions achieved the strongest and most rapid effects. The researchers said NPIs should be continued as China gradually opens up.“Given travel and work resuming in China, the country should consider at least the partial continuation of NPIs to ensure that the Covid-19 outbreak is sustainably controlled for the first wave of this outbreak.”“For example, early case identification and isolation should be maintained, which may also help to prevent and delay the arrival of a second wave, considering the increasing numbers of cases imported from other countries the presence of asymptomatic or subclinical infections found in China,” the research said.On the ongoing lockdown in India, the researcher Lai said the intensity depends on the combined interventions.“I don’t have the details of interventions in India, but I think the effects depend on the intensity and duration of combined interventions implemented in each country, not just the travel restriction and social distancing measures,” Lai said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-covid-lockdown-in-china-could-have-reduced-cases-study/story-oF0RTV1Uhj2hZ4NFmHqchI.html

08-05-2020||World||Turning oil wells back on is trickier than shutting them off||With thousands of oil wells choking back or completely shutting off production, companies already are looking ahead to what may prove to be an even bigger challenge: turning wells back on.U.S. and Canadian oil producers are curbing as much as 4.5 million barrels of daily supplies, according to Plains All American Pipeline LP. In the U.S. alone, drillers have announced plans to halt more than 600,000 barrels of daily output this month and next, said Rystad Energy AS. Old-style, conventional wells were the first to go down and the closures are expanding to some of the horizontal gushers that represent shale drillers’ prize assets.Although shutting down a well can be a relatively simple -- and even remote-controlled -- process, industry executives and their engineering teams aren’t altogether sure how smoothly an idle well can be restarted.“When you shut in wells, especially for a long period of time, you have a lot of surprises,” Clay Bretches, an executive vice president at Apache Corp., said during a conference call with analysts on Thursday. “Some of them are good and some of them are bad.”Executives are careful about disclosing which wells are being curtailed -- which involves squeezing back on the volume of crude flowing out of the well -- versus those that are completely shut down. That’s because reversing a total shutdown presents a more challenging set of tasks and costs.Houston-based Apache has shut about 2,500 wells, and Bretches said the company is taking “great pains” to make sure they’re being preserved. That includes preventing corrosion and maintaining equipment that sits atop the well in remote fields.WPX Energy Inc., which plans to shut in a total of about 45,000 barrels of oil a day this month and possibly next, said it could be as simple as remotely opening up valves or speeding up electric pumps installed at the bottom of some wells. But the company cautioned against the expectation that it could be done quickly.Restoration Costs“It wouldn’t be as simple as ‘just give us a couple days and we’ll be back up running at 100%,’” said WPX Chief Operating Officer Clay Gaspar. “Anybody who says that, they’re probably short-changing their field organization just a touch.”That’s why deciding whether to shut a well involves more than just comparing operating costs and oil prices, according to Rystad. Producers also must weigh the cost and mechanical difficulty of restoring those wells back to pre-curtailed volumes.“When you start back up from the level we’re at, we do expect to have some start-up capital,” said Jeff Alvarez, head of investor relations of Occidental Petroleum Corp., which is shutting down about 5% of its production next month. “It’s things like, just when I spend $1 today, I don’t get production for a couple of months from that.”Cimarex Energy Co. said the obstacles to reopening wells mostly revolve around speed and costs, rather than any threats to the structural integrity of the rocks themselves. The Denver-based explorer held an internal technical session recently that looked at how its reservoirs would be affected by shut-ins, and the results showed that they were likely to be “just fine.”Pipeline Capacity“We think we’re in pretty good shape with our reservoirs to shut them in and bring them back when we need,” CEO Tom Jorden said during a conference call.Oil companies aren’t the only ones who have to think about the long-term impacts of shuttered wells. Millions of miles of pipelines crisscross the continent to haul crude from the field to refineries and export terminals. As supplies drop, so does demand for pipeline capacity.Pipeline operator Targa Resources Corp. was asked Thursday if the wells its system serves would ever ramp up to previous volumes.“I think for the most part, we’d expect the shut-in volumes to come back and perform well,” Targa CEO Matt Meloy said. “Could there be some older, really low-rate vertical wells ... which they shut-in and just don’t bring back? I think there could be some amount of those.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turning-oil-wells-back-on-is-trickier-than-shutting-them-off/story-yvD7KAA7VOK6TShrEgvCTO.html

Those statements can both be true,” he told reporters, adding later that China had “perpetrated” the virus.Beijing has repeatedly hit back at the claims. “We urge the US side to stop shifting the blame to China and turn to facts,” China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying retorted at a press briefing Thursday.Spiegel reported that German authorities also targeted China with criticism, citing “BND information” that Beijing pressured the World Health Organization to delay issuing a global warning after the initial outbreak in Wuhan.“In a January 21 telephone call, Chinese President Xi Jinping asked WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to hold back information about person-to-person transmission and delay a pandemic warning,” the news weekly wrote on its website.“According to the BND’s assessment, China’s information policy cost four to six weeks of time to fight the virus worldwide,” Spiegel added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-doubts-us-claims-of-china-covid-19-lab-leak-report/story-mOpNxVtYuX9DowQbgcPMcL.html

There was no known casualties on either side, but the incident was a reminder of persistent tensions on the peninsula.A statement from the North’s Ministry of the People’s Armed Forces accused South Korea of mobilizing fighter jets and warships for drills in the western sea boundary on Wednesday.“Such reckless move of the military warmongers of the south side is the height of the military confrontation,” said the statement, carried by the North’s state media. “This is a grave provocation which can never be overlooked and this situation demands a necessary reaction from us.”North Korea said the South Korean drills violated 2018 agreements that require both countries to halt firing exercises along their land and sea borders to lower front-line animosities.South Korea’s Defense Ministry said the drills didn’t break the agreements because they took place in its western waters, about 300 kilometres (186 miles) away from the sea boundary. A ministry official, requesting anonymity citing department rules, said that South Korea has been maintaining its military readiness without violating the 2018 agreements.On Sunday, Seoul said several bullets fired from North Korea struck one of their front-line guard posts before South Korean soldiers fired 20 warning shots in response. South Korea sent a message requesting North Korea explain the incident, but the North has yet to reply, according to the Defense Ministry.Relations between the two significantly improved in 2018 as their leaders held three rounds of summit talks. But much of their rapprochement became stalled as broader diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington came to a standstill due to disputes over terms under which North Korea can fully abandon its nuclear program.The Koreas remain split along the world’s most heavily fortified border since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. The United States stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea to help deter potential aggression from North Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-slams-south-for-reckless-drills-along-sea-border/story-MtBqLZ9UQwRwCF7Ix1L1CM.html

Hunkering down at home to ride out the crisis isn’t an option for many, because securing the next meal means hustling to find a way to sell, clean, drive or otherwise work, despite the risk.How the world’s poor get through this pandemic will help determine how quickly the global economy recovers and how much aid is needed to keep countries afloat.In Kenya, Judith Andeka has seen tough times before.The 33-year-old mother of five lost her husband two years ago and was left to make ends meet on just $2.50 to $4 a day from washing clothes in Nairobi’s Kibera, one of the world’s biggest slums.But things were never as tough as they are now.Neighbors aren’t going to work because of restrictions on movement, so they can’t afford her services. Even if they could, they don’t want her handling their laundry due to virus concerns.“I haven’t had a good day for the last two weeks,” Andeka said.She’s been forced to send all five kids to live with relatives who are slightly better off: “I had no choice, because how do you tell a 2-year-old you have no food to give them?” In Argentina, Rosemary Páez Carabajal pushed a coffee cart on the streets of Argentina’s capital, until the lockdown forced her to stop.Páez Carabajal, her blacksmith husband who’s also out of work and their two children rent a single room in a two-story brick building for the equivalent of $119 a month.Now the cart sits idle in the hall, and the home is stacked with textbooks as the couple try to home-school their lone school-age child, a 7-year-old son.They are dipping into meager savings and relying on a one-time government aid voucher worth about $150. For now, their landlord is not collecting rent.Páez Carabajal worries her small business may not survive even after restrictions are eased.“People are going to have doubts about buying because the disease is transmitted by grabbing things,” she said.The coronavirus came at a time of already painful recession in Argentina, with more than a third of its 44 million residents in poverty, according to figures from late 2019. Some 3 million have requested food aid in recent weeks, adding to the 8 million getting such assistance before the pandemic.In Cairo, the sprawling and bustling metropolis of some 20 million people, the “ahwa,” or coffee shop, was among the first casualties of a shutdown order for many Egyptian businesses.No longer were they allowed to offer “sheesha,” the hookah waterpipe so popular in the Middle East. Before long they were closed altogether.That cost Hany Hassan his job. He hadn’t been making much — $5 a day — but it was enough to feed his family.“We are financially ruined,” said the 40-year-old father of four.Unable to find work in a relatively pricey Cairo he could no longer afford, he moved back to family in his hometown of Mallawi, about 190 miles (300 kilometers) to the south.But his chances for work there are even dimmer. Chronic back pain means he can’t do the manual labour jobs many people work in the provinces.Jobless for over a month, he goes out daily looking for work but comes back empty-handed every night. To keep afloat, he’s borrowed money.Before the pandemic, one in three Egyptians or roughly 33 million people were living on about $1.45 per day, and around 6% were in extreme poverty, or living on less than a dollar a day, according to the country’s official statistics agency.The government has created an emergency fund for vulnerable people, offering the equivalent of around $32 a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-covid-19-pandemic-the-world-s-working-poor-hustle-to-survive/story-QVkatcz7GFqW2mMoeoPzPM.html
08-05-2020||World||Ahead of WHO meet, chorus for Covid-19 probe that puts China under the lens||The chorus for transparency and investigation into the outbreak of the coronavirus disease is growing louder in the run up to the truncated session of the World Health Assembly 10 days later.The disease, which originated in China late last year, has killed more than a quarter of a million people across the world in a little over four months. China has been blamed by many countries for not giving the world a heads up about the disease that could have minimised its spread. Questions have also been asked of the World Health Organisation that has been accused of being overly deferential to China.The loudest criticism of China and WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has come from the United States President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Last month, the US suspended funding to the WHO to drive home the point.But the United States isn’t the only one upset about China and WHO’s role.Over the last week and more, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also lent the grouping’s backing to calls for an investigation into the origin of Covid outbreak.Also Read: China must come clean on Covid-19| OpinionThis week, the European Union declared that it would move a resolution at the World Health Assembly for a timely review of the international response to the coronavirus pandemic including the World Health Organisation’s performance.Diplomats in Washington and Geneva suggest that the resolution, which was being drafted in consultation with a large number of countries, presented a huge test for China in the run up to the global health body’s annual meeting.Beijing has been under fire over its early handling of the virus, which has pushed the global economy toward recession as it spreads around the world. Cases have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories since they were first identified in China in December 2019.British defence secretary Ben Wallace too questioned the role of China in the Covid-19 outbreak, asserting that China needs to be open and transparent about what it learnt, its shortcomings also successes.Ben Wallace’s remarks are seen in context of British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab’s statement in April that underscored the need to ask “hard questions” about how the coronavirus came about and how it could have been stopped.Swedish Health Minister Lena Hallengren made it clear last month that her government wanted the origin of the virus probed besides an investigation into the WHO’s role in the pandemic.It is in this context, diplomats in Washington said, that China appeared to have started approaching governments in countries for support in face of public criticism. This strategy was outed in Germany where Chinese diplomats approached German government officials to request them to make “positive public statements” on China’s handling of the disease. Officials in Berlin had declined the request.Beijing has had to battle accusations that it had attempted to cover up the outbreak of the disease and told the world about the disease much too late. For instance, questions are being asked why Chinese authorities stopped flights from Wuhan to the rest of the country after the Covid-19 outbreak but allowed international flights. Or why it clamped down on research by Chinese scientists into the origins of the virus.Authorities had reprimanded doctors including Li Wenliang, who later passed away, for sharing warnings about the coronavirus infection risk in WeChat groups in late December.Criticism about this approach to censor information reignited on Friday after a line that referred to the coronavirus disease being detected in China and spreading to the world was removed from an article written for a Chinese daily by 27 European ambassadors to commemorate the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the EU and China.But there have been several instances of Chinese diplomats posted around the world launching attacks on the media for what they describe as efforts to politicise the Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ahead-of-who-meet-chorus-for-covid-19-probe-that-puts-china-under-the-lens/story-4LjdRdoJkky44nhOxJoWeO.html
08-05-2020||World||Operation Warp Speed: The race to save US prestige and find Covid-19 vaccine||When the Soviet Union put the first man into space in 1961, the shock to America’s self-confidence was electric. If China should be first to produce a successful vaccine against the coronavirus, US prestige is likely to suffer a similar blow.President Donald Trump is putting everything he’s got into a research effort dubbed Operation Warp Speed, which pulls together pharmaceutical companies, government agencies and the military. So is China, which has a head start at a time the two countries are already engaged in a fight for dominance impacting everything from trade to the roll-out of 5G communications networks.The stakes in finding a vaccine against the coronavirus couldn’t be higher. In just a few months the disease has claimed more than a quarter of a million lives and shattered economies worldwide.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicWhile many leaders are talking about global collaboration, history suggests that national interests will dominate — the government that can immunize its workforce first stands to gain not just economic advantage, but the validation of its technological prowess and international influence. If that government is in Beijing, the impact could be as dramatic as Yuri Gagarin’s trip into orbit almost 60 years ago. “When it’s tense like it is now between the US and China, every single thing gets distorted by the geopolitics,” said David Fidler, a specialist in cyber security and global health at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations. Should Beijing produce the first vaccine, the US “will worry that China would weaponize the vaccine in geopolitical terms,” he said. Both the US and China have played down talk of competition, with Chinese officials in particular stressing the common nature of the threat from Covid-19. No vaccine has ever been made on the kinds of schedules being targeted, counted in months rather than years. Scientists familiar with the process warn it isn’t certain that one can be developed at all, let alone by the end of the year. So the risk of disappointment is high.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakIn a recent town hall on Fox News, Trump said the US was working with both Britain and Australia on vaccine projects, and wasn’t focused on who got there first. “I really don’t care,” he said. “If it’s another country, I’ll take my hat off to them. We have to come up with a vaccine.”Health Secretary Alex Azar said this week that the US expects to be able to start manufacturing the drugs itself, whoever makes the scientific breakthrough.Still, in the first months of the pandemic, signs of geopolitical rivalry have been there for all to see, and trust lacking even among allies.The state government in Berlin accused the US of “modern piracy,” for allegedly snatching away shipments of Chinese protective gear earmarked for Germany, a claim denied by the US The Europeans are bringing in new rules to protect their pharmaceutical firms from foreign acquisitions. China has irritated western governments with highly publicized airlifts of medical aid to selected countries and suggestions its success in containing the virus is proof of a superior political system.The US is signalling that its own efforts are focused on protecting the American people first. Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday described the US vaccine program as aiming “to develop a vaccine for the people of the United States.” The administration is targeting 300 million doses — enough to inoculate most of the country — by January.China’s research process is for now more advanced, with a total of 508 volunteers joining a second phase trial for a potential vaccine that the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences is developing with a Tianjin-based company, CanSino Biologics. Results from the trial could be known as soon as this month.Russia has at least four vaccine projects underway, including at Novosibirsk Vector, a laboratory that once worked on Soviet bio-weapons programs, according to Sergei Netesov, a former executive at the lab who now teaches at Novosibirsk State University. The goal, he says, is for Russia to make sure its own population has protection without being dependent on its rivals.Others are in the mix, too, with the UK saying that if a promising Oxford University project is successful, Britons will be at the front to the line.To be sure, France and Germany are leading the charge for a more cooperative approach, securing pledges of 7.4 billion euro ($8 billion) at a virtual Group of Twenty fund raiser on May 4. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, meanwhile, has said it will build manufacturing capacity to make as many seven vaccines available, even before they exist, an unprecedented effort to ensure wide and rapid availability.“This pandemic is a global challenge and we will therefore also only be able to overcome it globally,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said at the G-20 video conference. “We are ready to go new ways.”But past experience isn’t encouraging. During the 2009 H1N1 flu epidemic, governments also issued joint declarations committing themselves to collaboration in the development and distribution of vaccines. Nevertheless, as soon as they were available, countries that could afford to bought up doses and hoarded them, to ensure their populations would get inoculated first.The US snubbed Monday’s G-20 vaccine initiative, objecting to the involvement of the World Health Organization, while officials in both Washington and Beijing have indulged in conspiracy theories and blame games to accuse the other of responsibility for the virus. Trump has blamed the WHO for failing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and halted US funding to the organization. China is emerging first from its lockdown to reboot its economy, while the US and Europe are still struggling to contain the virus and piling on vast sums of national debt to cushion the economic impact, risking long periods of slow growth ahead.Even the G-20 leadership of Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron is in part designed to compensate for the failure of the European Union’s collective response to the coronavirus so far, according to Stefan Lehne, a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe, a Brussels-based think tank. Perceived German and EU failures to help Italy early in the crisis caused resentment and opened a diplomatic window for China and Russia, both of which sent high profile shipments of medical aid to Italy.“Bill Gates said this is like a world war and we are all on the same side,” says Lehne. “This is not so evident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-going-all-in-on-a-vaccine-he-may-still-get-beaten-by-china/story-xU6PKa9DG0QDYF8G9ZLB1N.html
08-05-2020||World||Most Covid patients may lose sense of smell by third day of infection: Study||Loss of the sense of smell is most likely to occur by the third day of infection with the novel coronavirus, according to a study of over 100 Covid-19 patients which may help public health experts better identify those carrying the virus without adverse symptoms. The telephonic study, whose results were published in the journal Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, examined characteristics and symptoms of 103 patients who were diagnosed with Covid-19 over a six-week period. The patients from Aarau, Switzerland provided data on the number of days they had Covid-19 symptoms, and the timing and severity of their loss of smell, said study co-author, Ahmad Sedaghat from the University of Cincinnati in the US. Of the 103 patients, at least 61 per cent reported reduced or lost sense of smell, Sedaghat said, adding that the mean onset for reduction or loss in the sense of smell was 3.4 days. “We also found in this study that the severity of the loss of smell is correlated with how bad your other Covid-19 symptoms will be,” Sedaghat said. “If the anosmia, also known as loss of smell, is worse, the patients reported worse shortness of breath, and more severe fever and cough,” he added. According to the scientist, the relationship between decreased sense of smell and the rest of the Covid-19 is something to be aware of. “If someone has a decreased sense of smell with Covid-19, we know they are within the first week of the disease course, and there is still another week or two to expect,” he added.The findings indicated that a decreased sense of smell may be an indicator of patients early in the disease course as well as those who may go on to develop more severe symptoms, like shortness of breath, Sedaghat said. He cautioned that while the loss of smell is an indicator of Covid-19, it’s not the only factor. “When you start to experience serious symptoms of Covid-19 which include shortness of breath and respiratory distress, that’s when you should become alarmed,” he said. Younger patients and women in the study were also more likely to experience a decreased loss of smell, the study noted. About 50 per cent of study patients experienced a stuffy nose and 35 per cent experienced a runny nose. According to Sedaghat, this is important since previous studies indicated that these nasal symptoms were rare in Covid-19, and these symptoms were attributed to allergy and not the novel coronavirus. “This just means that greater awareness is needed of Covid-19’s nasal symptoms so people are not running around sneezing in public and thinking it is okay since this is just allergies,” Sedaghat said. “It very well could be Covid-19 and wearing masks as protective gear for others you encounter is a good idea,” he added. Understanding more about loss of smell and Covid-19 is important for a public health perspective, the scientist cautioned. “No one is going to die because of a loss of the sense of smell and it’s not the symptom that will kill anyone,” he said, but adding that, “it is important because it helps us to identify these Covid-19 patients as asymptomatic carriers so they don’t spread the disease to others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-covid-patients-may-lose-sense-of-smell-by-third-day-of-infection-study/story-amScEAgZ7AuIdg5n33J7YK.html
08-05-2020||World||Blood thinners may boost survival rates of Covid-19 infected patients: Report||Treating coronavirus patients with blood thinners may help in boosting their prospects for survival, according to preliminary findings from physicians at New York City’s largest hospital system that offers another source of hope in treating the deadly infection.The Washington Post reported that the results of the analysis, conducted over 2,733 patients, were published on Wednesday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.In an interview to the newspaper, Valentin Fuster, a physician in chief at Mount Sinai Hospital and one of the study’s authors, said that the observations were based only on a review of medical records and that more rigorous and randomised studies are needed to draw broader conclusions.But the results have been promising, he said.“My opinion is cautious, but I must tell you I think this is going to help. This is the opening of the door for what drugs to use and what questions to answer,” the physician further stated.Since March, when coronavirus hit Europe and the United States, doctors have been reporting mysterious blood clots, which can be gel-like or even semisolid, in a significant subset of coronavirus patients. Autopsies of patients who died of respiratory arrest have shown that some had unusual micro clots in their lungs rather than the typical damage expected.Last month, doctors reported in the New England Journal of Medicine on five unusual cases of COVID-19 positive people in their 30s and 40s experiencing large strokes.The Mount Sinai study focused on hospitalised patients who were treated from March 14 to April 11. Among the patients, those who were not on ventilators and treated with blood thinners died at similar rates in comparison to those who did not receive blood thinners. But the group of patients who received blood thinners lived longer -- a median of 21 days compared to 14 days, the study said.For patients on ventilators, the difference was more significant. About 63 per cent of patients who did not receive the medications died compared with 29 per cent who received the treatment.Another critical finding of the study was that giving blood thinners to these patients appeared to be relatively safe. There was not a significant difference in the most dangerous side effect of anticoagulants -- bleeding -- in those who were on the drugs and those who were not.Fuster said that as a result of the analysis, the hospital system changed its treatment protocols several days ago to begin giving higher doses of blood thinners to the patients infected with COVID-19.Deepak Bhatt, a professor at Harvard Medical School who specialises in interventional cardiology, called the paper “a very important study” with the blood issues in COVID-19 patients having evolved from just a suspicion to a well-recognised complication of the virus. “What we are figuring now is what do we do now that we know in terms of treatments,” he said.A number of medical societies, including the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis and the American Society of Hematology, have put out guidance recommending the use of blood thinners for some COVID-19 patients, but the advice has taken a conservative approach.“It is a delicate balance between clotting and bleeding, especially when patients are as sick as some of the ones who have COVID-19,” said Geoffrey Barnes, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan who works in cardiovascular medicine.“A week ago, we were making some educated guesses on how to prevent blood clots. This is the first time we have seen data that says higher doses may possibly be effective and safe,” he was quoted as saying.Doctors caring for the sickest coronavirus patients confront a limited arsenal of treatments. On May 1, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorisation for the antiviral drug remdesivir in patients who are hospitalised and seriously ill.But trials of other treatments, including those involving Hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug touted by US President Donald Trump, have been stopped because of a lack of efficacy and concerns about toxicity.In late April, scientists also reported that an arthritis drug made by Regeneron and Sanofi that had drawn enthusiasm from investors early on produced disappointing results in clinical trials, according to The Washington Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blood-thinners-may-boost-survival-rates-of-covid-19-infected-patients-report/story-ZoaHyGBIecseqITSsPabJK.html
08-05-2020||World||End ‘tsunami of hate and xenophobia’ sparked by Covid-19, says UN Chief||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called Friday for an “all-out effort” to end the “tsunami of hate and xenophobia” sparked by the novel coronavirus pandemic, without naming specific countries.“The pandemic continues to unleash a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scaremongering,” Guterres said in a statement.“Anti-foreigner sentiment has surged online and in the streets. Anti-Semitic conspiracy theories have spread and Covid-19-related anti-Muslim attacks have occurred.”According to Guterres, migrants and refugees have been “vilified as a source of the virus -- and then denied access to medical treatment.”Meanwhile, “contemptible memes have emerged suggesting” that older people, some of the most vulnerable to the virus, “are also the most expendable,” he said.Additionally, “journalists, whistleblowers, health professionals, aid workers and human rights defenders are being targeted simply for doing their jobs,” Guterres said.The UN chief appealed for “an all-out effort to end hate speech globally,” and singled out educational institutions to help teach “digital literacy” to young people -- whom he called “captive and potentially despairing audiences.”Guterres also called on “the media, especially social media companies, to do much more to flag and... remove racist, misogynist and other harmful content.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/end-tsunami-of-hate-and-xenophobia-sparked-by-covid-19-says-un-chief/story-K2Mvobkvo0YAnN1zsBQGqN.html
08-05-2020||World||North Korea’s Kim praises Xi Jinping for Covid-19 outbreak control in China||North Korea says leader Kim Jong Un sent a personal message to Chinese President Xi Jinping praising what he described as China’s success in getting its coronavirus epidemic under control.The report by North Korea’s state media followed an assessment by South Korea’s spy agency that the pandemic is hurting the North’s economy, already crippled by decades of policy failures and U.S.-led international sanctions over its nuclear weapons program.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageChina is North Korea’s most significant ally and economic lifeline, accounting for about 90% of the country’s external trade. With China’s Covid-19 caseload easing, some experts say the North could reach out to China to reinvigorate cross-border trade that had been significantly reduced in past months.The Korean Central News Agency says Kim in the message to Xi “congratulated him, highly appreciating that he is seizing a chance of victory in the war against the unprecedented epidemic.” It did not specify when the message was sent.South Korea’s spy agency recently told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing that trade volume between North Korea and China in the first quarter declined 55% from a year earlier. In March, the bilateral trade volume suffered a 91% drop, lawmakers cited the agency as saying.North took intense action to avoid an outbreak by closing its borders in January and quarantining thousands of people. It still contends it has had no cases of infection, though many outsiders doubt that.A South Korean lawmaker who discussed the spy agency’s findings earlier this week said the National Intelligence Service cannot rule out an outbreak in the North. But the agency concluded skyrocketing food prices and panic-buying in Pyongyang and a reduction in Kim Jong Un’s public appearances this year were evidence of the impact, the lawmaker said.South Korea reported 12 fresh cases of the new coronavirus, its first increase above 10 in five days. Figures by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention brought national totals to 10,822 cases and 256 deaths. Three of the new cases were detected in the hardest-hit city of Daegu, and three were passengers screened at airports. As its caseload has slowed, South Korea has relaxed social distancing guidelines, allowing sports to resume and preparing to reopen schools. South Korea’s professional soccer league will begin its new season on Friday, following Tuesday’s baseball openers. Still, health officials warning of new infections urged people to reconsider visiting their elderly parents on Friday, which is national parents’ day, and over the weekend.China announced one new virus case, a local infection in Jilin province, and 16 new cases of people who are not showing symptoms. Just 260 people remain hospitalized and 890 are in isolation as suspected cases or for having tested positive but without showing symptoms. China has reported 4,633 deaths among 82,886 cases. Also, China’s football teams will temporarily cut players’ pay to help teams manage losses. The head of China’s football association, Chen Xuyuan, also told state broadcaster CCTV that matches would resume on a staggered schedule but gave no dates.The United Nations is appealing to governments, companies and billionaires to contribute to a $6.7 billion appeal to fight the coronavirus pandemic in vulnerable countries. U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock warns that a failure to help could lead to a “hunger pandemic,” famine, riots and more conflict. Lowcock said there is already evidence of incomes plummeting and jobs disappearing, food supplies falling and prices soaring, and children missing vaccinations and meals — and the peak of the pandemic isn’t expected to hit the world’s poorest countries for three to six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-praises-xi-jinping-for-covid-10-outbreak-control-in-china/story-tYV5rBcTpF3gBHUW3gBD3N.html

When she failed to return three days later, police were informed and the man was placed in detention in Shaanxi province’s Jingbian county.Rescuers said despite the woman’s ordeal, she was faintly calling for help as she was freed, state media said Friday.The China Daily newspaper and other outlets reporting on the case cited a police statement that was not available online. An official reached by phone at the Jingbian county prosecutor’s office confirmed an investigation was underway but declined to give further details. The man would only give his surname, Yan.The man was identified as a 58-year-old with the surname Ma and his 79-year-old mother, surnamed Wang.She is partially paralyzed and her son was apparently fed up with having to constantly take care of her, China Daily reported.Public assistance in much of China is lacking, especially in poor rural areas, and families are generally expected to look after their own elderly relatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/woman-buried-by-her-son-saved-after-3-days-in-grave-say-police/story-7RUOeUUKoyhM4AwgaoTWYM.html
08-05-2020||World||Coronavirus deals ‘powerful blow’ to Putin’s grand plans||The bombastic military parade through Moscow’s Red Square on Saturday was slated to be the spectacle of the year on the Kremlin’s calendar.Standing with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron, President Vladimir Putin would have overseen a 90-minute procession of Russia’s military might, showcasing 15,000 troops and the latest hardware.But that was before the coronavirus pandemic.Now, military jets will roar over an eerily quiet Moscow, spurting red, white and blue smoke to mark 75 years since the defeat of Nazi Germany. Putin will lay flowers at a war memorial near an abandoned Red Square and address a nation growing angry with his handling of the country.The parade is not the only victim of the coronavirus pandemic, which has crippled Russia’s economy, hospitalised the prime minister and slashed Putin’s approval ratings.Russians had been due last month to cast their votes on constitutional reforms that would have paved the way for Putin to stay in power until 2036, but those plans too were scuppered by the virus.What was supposed to be a triumphant spring for Putin has become a political letdown, observers say, one that could be difficult for the president to recover from.“This is the first time in 20 years that Putin is facing a crisis this serious,” said political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya. “This is a new experience for him.”The timing of the pandemic, hitting just as Putin was unveiling major constitutional reforms, amounts to “a powerful blow to his plans”, she told AFP.Approval at historic lowAfter initially reporting fewer cases than in western Europe, Russia has witnessed a grim and steady rise in new coronavirus infections in recent days.Health officials registered another record increase on Thursday and the country now ranks fifth in the world in overall infections.Russia’s death rate is low compared to the European countries hardest hit, but some observers say that discrepancy is due to how the death count is calculated.Putin this week praised the government’s response, saying that by implementing mass testing and keeping fatalities low, Russia had become a model for other countries.“What we did was absolutely right,” he said. “Many foreign countries followed our path.”Yet many Russians appear to disagree. Unlike other world leaders battling the pandemic, Putin’s approval ratings have not rallied in light of the crisis.According to independent pollster Levada, they fell to a historic low of 59 percent last month from 63 percent in March.Already strained by Western sanctions, Russia’s economy is under serious threat from the pandemic, which analysts say could deepen resentment towards the Kremlin.Since Russia imposed a lockdown to slow the spread of the virus, small businesses have struggled to survive and millions of Russians have been left without wages, despite promises from the government to support companies and employees.Igor Nikolayev, director of the Institute for Strategic Analysis at FBK Grant Thornton, said the timing of the crisis was unfortunate as it coincided with a steep fall in the price of oil, a key export which balances the Russian budget.‘Distant from the people’He said Russians were not prepared for this dual shock, noting that 60 percent do not have savings and that real incomes have fallen 7.5 percent over the last year.Russia can weather the storm for around 18 months, he said, thanks to reserves in its sovereign wealth fund of some $150 billion.But if the crisis persists and “life does not become easier, this will affect the attitude of the people to the authorities,” Nikolayev told AFP.Putin could well bounce back. He has weathered many crises over 20 years in power and is credited by many Russians for bringing the country out of the chaos of the 1990s and restoring its global prestige.Officials have said both the parade and the constitutional vote will be held later in 2020, though analyst Andrei Kolesnikov said that alone may not be enough to salvage Putin’s year.Putin “enjoyed Russians’ approval for many years,” said Kolesnikov, of the Carnegie Moscow Centre. “Now he will personally accumulate all their disapproval.”“In the context of the coronavirus crisis, the vote will not mobilise the nation,” he said, and the military parade alone “will not seriously help support Putin’s falling ratings.”Stanovaya said that after so many years in power Putin has “distanced himself from the people” and lost the ability to empathise with Russians.If the Kremlin cannot address economic problems, “social irritation will grow, there will be protests,” she warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-deals-powerful-blow-to-putin-s-grand-plans/story-j54vWnB1RsOiC8HFYkukTI.html
08-05-2020||World||US Supreme Court’s Ginsburg, 87, discharged from hospital||Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, at 87 the US Supreme Court’s oldest member, was discharged on Wednesday from hospital where she was treated for a benign gall bladder condition and took part remotely in arguments in two cases. In a statement released on Wednesday evening, court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said Ginsburg is “doing well and glad to be home” after being discharged from Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.Earlier in the day, her participation in two arguments, conducted by teleconference amid the coronavirus pandemic, marked the latest instance in which the liberal justice withstood a health scare and returned swiftly to her duties on the court, where she has served since 1993. Ginsburg asked a number of questions and her voice sounded hesitant at times but largely remained firm. Ginsburg will return to the Baltimore hospital for outpatient visits in the following weeks, and a gallstone that caused the infection will be removed without the need for a surgical procedure, Arberg added. Ginsburg was treated for pancreatic cancer last year. The first case involved an Obamacare requirement regarding health insurance coverage for women’s birth control. The second involved a federal law cracking down on so-called robocalls.In the first case, Ginsburg posed lengthy questions expressing doubt over a bid by President Donald Trump’s administration to implement rules allowing employers to obtain religious exemptions from the contraception mandate.She told the administration’s lawyer, Solicitor General Noel Francisco, that it has “tossed entirely to the wind what Congress considered to be essential, that women be provided this service, with no hassle and no cost to them.” On Tuesday, Ginsburg was treated for an inflammatory condition of the gallbladder known as acute cholecystitis. Her hospitalization could have posed a risk as it comes amid a pandemic that continues to surge throughout the United States and around the world. The coronavirus has proven to be particularly dangerous in elderly people, especially those with underlying medical issues. Ginsburg has had several health scares in recent years. In November 2018, she broke three ribs in a fall. Subsequent medical tests led to treatment for lung cancer that caused her to miss arguments in January 2019. She returned to the bench, but in August 2019 received radiation therapy to treat pancreatic cancer. She was hospitalized last November for two nights suffering from a fever and chills but returned to work at the court the day after being released.Her health is closely watched because a Supreme Court vacancy would give Republican President Donald Trump the opportunity to appoint a third justice to the nine-member court and move it further to the right. The court currently has a 5-4 conservative majority including two justices appointed by Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-s-ginsburg-87-discharged-from-hospital/story-3VdHdSYbQIFr1ycevCHL1N.html

Both the Hindu and Christian communities in Sindh and Punjab continued to report cases of forced conversion.” In Punjab, girls as young as 14, were forcibly converted and coerced into marriage. In Sindh, the case of two Hindu girls whose families claimed they had been kidnapped for marriage and converted forcibly, drew widespread attention when the Islamabad High Court ruled that the girls were not minors at the time of marriage and allowed them to return to their spouses.“In January, the Supreme Court created a one-person commission to report on the implementation of the 2014 judgment on the protection of minorities’ rights and promotion of a culture of religious and social tolerance,” the report said.“The 22-member parliamentary committee to protect minorities from forced conversions was finally notified in November and tasked with framing legislation against forced conversions.” It said. “The job quota for religious minorities has yet to be implemented. The ordeal of Aasia Bibi, who was convicted of blasphemy in a high profile case in 2010 and then acquitted in 2018, finally ended in January when the Supreme Court threw out a review petition against her acquittal. She left the country in May to be reunited with her family,” the report said.It says the Ahmadi community faced constant persecution and discrimination. In June, four teenagers on their way home after playing cricket set on fire a watchman’s cabin outside an Ahmadi worship place in Wah Cantt. They were identified from CCTV footage and arrested. In April, the Lahore High Court ordered the recovery of a 14-year-old Christian girl from the illegal custody of a Muslim man, Mohammad Zafar, in Faisalabad and sent her back to her family. She confirmed that she was abducted and sold to Zafar, who forced her to convert before coercing her into marriage. A certificate from a local seminary said the girl had embraced Islam out of her ‘free’ will and had been named Ayesha. In September, a 15-year-old Christian girl from Hafizabad was recovered from a madrassah where she had been taken by her school principal. The girl said that her teacher had told her she had automatically become a Muslim because she was studying Arabic. Cases of kidnapping and forced conversion in Hindus are always accompanied by controversy over whether the girls involved converted and married of their own free will. A group of Hindu community members took to the streets of Rahim Yar Khan in April, protesting against the forced conversions of girls. Three people in Bahawalpur were charged with abducting a 12-year-old Hindu girl, Kashmala Devi when she went with members of her family to harvest the wheat crop in the fields of two of the suspects.Highlighting the plight of women in Pakistan, the report says in December, Pakistan was ranked at 151 out of 153 by the World Economic Forum on the Global Gender Gap Index.“Despite the legislation enacted to protect and promote women’s rights in recent years, violence against women has escalated. Women continued to face discrimination in employment, financial inclusion, political representation, and access to connectivity and education. In its second year, Aurat March gave women across Pakistan a public space to articulate their issues, but not without inviting undue criticism and harassment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/religious-minorities-continue-to-suffer-says-pak-s-human-rights-body/story-BYYBToFOisSG4hNJu3WykI.html

08-05-2020||World||Prominent lawyer, Trump donor representing Biden accuser||Tara Reade, a former Senate staffer who alleged Joe Biden sexually assaulted her 27 years ago, is being represented by a prominent lawyer and political donor to President Donald Trump’s 2016 Republican campaign.Attorney Douglas Wigdor told The Associated Press he was not currently being paid for his work with Reade. His firm also denied there was a political motivation for his decision to represent Reade in her accusations against Trump’s presumptive Democratic opponent in the November election.“We have decided to take this matter on because every survivor has the right to competent counsel,” the firm said in a statement.Reade has said for weeks that she was struggling to find a lawyer willing to represent her. She’s accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in 1993, when she worked on his Senate staff. He has denied her allegation.On Thursday, Reade said she wanted Biden to be “held accountable” and called on him to drop out of the presidential race. Her comments came in her first on-camera interview, conducted by former Fox News and NBC News journalist Megyn Kelly.Pressed by a Florida television station about Reade’s comment, Biden reiterated his denial of the allegation.“The truth is what matters,” he told Bay News 9. “In this case, the truth is these claims are flat-out false.”Wigdor is well known for his work on prominent cases related to sexual harassment and assault. He represented six women who accused Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood producer, of sexual misconduct. He has also represented a number of Fox News employees in cases alleging gender and racial discrimination at the network.Wigdor has been a supporter of Trump and provided about $55,000 in campaign contributions in 2016, according to Federal Election Commission records. He has also supported some Democratic politicians, including New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, and has not donated to either Trump’s or Biden’s 2020 campaign.Wigdor said he plans to help Reade in her dealings with the media and any independent investigations into her allegations that might occur. He said the two have not discussed bringing a lawsuit based on her claims, but he did not rule that out.Wigdor suggested Reade’s earlier struggles to find a lawyer to represent her were the result of “politics.”“I think highly of a lot of these people,” he said. “These are my friends and colleagues, people who I respect, but they tend to be Democrats or liberals, and they were not interested, because of that, in representing Tara Reade.”Over the weekend, another attorney, William Moran, told the AP he was working with Reade.Moran, who works at a law firm in Columbia, Maryland, previously wrote and edited for Sputnik, a news agency founded and supported by the Russian state-owned media company Rossiya Segodnya. A January 2017 report released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Russia’s interference in the 2016 campaign said Sputnik was part of “Russia’s state-run propaganda machine,” which “contributed to the influence campaign by serving as a platform for Kremlin messaging to Russian and international audiences.”Reade herself has faced questions about her past writing praising Russian President Vladimir Putin. Reade on Thursday expressed concern to Kelly about having been “called a Russian agent” and said she had received a death threat from someone who “thought I was being a traitor to America.”There is no evidence to suggest Reade or Moran worked at the behest of Russia with respect to the Biden allegation.Moran contacted the AP on behalf of Reade to complain about and seek changes in a story detailing what Reade says she remembers writing in a Senate complaint about Biden. Reade told the AP she did not allege sexual assault in the complaint and did not explicitly use the words “sexual harassment,” though that is the behavior she believes she was describing.Moran told the AP in a text message Thursday that he found the focus on his past work “disgraceful.” He said Reade requested that he reach out to the AP “on a limited matter.”“I do not turn away clients who I believe and who have credible causes of action. I never will,” he said.Wigdor said Reade told him she was connected to Moran through Katie Halper, a podcaster who first interviewed Reade about her sexual assault allegation against Biden in March. It’s unclear how Reade connected with Wigdor, who said he believed she found the firm through “word of mouth and our reputation.”Reade first spoke out about her alleged interactions with Biden in 2019, telling journalists he had touched her inappropriately while she worked on his Senate staff. She came forward in 2020, around the time Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee, with new allegations of assault.She says she didn’t initially disclose the assault allegations because she was scared of backlash and was still coming to terms with what had happened to her.___AP Washington Bureau Chief Julie Pace and writer Brian Slodysko contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prominent-lawyer-trump-donor-representing-biden-accuser/story-Zo06Z6Yd1e5U2YxVmNJdfL.html
08-05-2020||World||Trump says will undergo Covid-19 test daily after military aide tests positive||After his military aide tested positive for coronavirus, US President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would undergo the Covid-19 test every day.A military aide of Trump, whom officials described as a personal valet, tested positive for coronavirus. The president said he had very little contact with him.“I have had very little contact, personal contact, with this gentleman. I know who he is. Good person. But I have had very little contact. (Vice President) Mike (Pence) has had very little contact with him. But Mike was tested and I was tested. We were both tested,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office of the White House.Responding to questions, Trump said he, the vice president and other staff of the White House would be tested for coronavirus every day.“I just had a test. In fact, I had one yesterday and one today, and it is negative. Mike just had a test and it is negative,” he said.“But they do the tests and it just shows you that the fallacy -- it is what I have been saying -- testing is not a perfect art. No matter what you do, testing is not a perfect art. So we test once a week. Now we are going to go testing once a day. But even when you test once a day, somebody could -- something happens where they catch something,” the president said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-will-test-for-covid-19-daily-after-military-aide-tests-positive/story-xSlnPMN6QsamwoQ30nDPgP.html

The country’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the Federal Government will contribute up to CA $ 3 billion for the hike with more expected from the provinces and territories.During his daily media briefing, Trudeau said that “if you are risking your health to keep this country moving and you’re still making minimum wage, you deserve a raise.”While many sectors of economic activity have closed in the country during the coronavirus crisis, others have been critical in ensuring essential services were still being provided. Principal among these are the front line healthcare workers. Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said, “Canada’s front line workers are dealing directly with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic by taking care of Canadians in our hospitals and nursing homes. They deserve our support. This measure will help workers critical to the current Covid-19 response get the compensation they need.”Workers in many other spheres may also benefit, though the sectors will be identified by local governments. Among these are those working at grocery stores, delivery persons, truckers, and some construction workers.In a release, the PMO said such workers deserved a “much-needed wage boost” because while most Canadians were asked to stay at home during the crisis, “millions of Canadians are being called on to go to work every day.”While the scheme was originally expected to be targeted at those making less than CA$ 2500 per month, that figure has been relaxed and provinces and territories will decide on who will qualify for it.Trudeau said these governments had either confirmed, or were in the process of confirming these wage top-up plans for essential workers. He said, “Workers are risking their health to provide us with essential care and services, and we need to make sure that they are paid properly for the work they do every day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wage-hike-for-essential-workers-on-duty-during-covid-19-crisis-in-canada/story-9ULb1pi9dRs1mw4zIS9EaO.html
08-05-2020||World||UN appeals for $6.7 billion to fight virus in poor countries||The United Nations called on governments, companies and billionaires Thursday to contribute to a $6.7 billion fund for fighting the coronavirus pandemic in vulnerable countries, warning that a failure to help could lead to a “hunger pandemic,” famine, riots and more conflict.U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said that “Covid-19 has now affected every country and almost every person on the planet.”He said the U.N.’s initial $2 billion appeal unveiled March 25 was being increased because there is already evidence of incomes plummeting and jobs disappearing, food supplies falling and prices soaring, and children missing vaccinations and meals. He added that the peak of the pandemic isn’t expected to hit the world’s poorest countries for three to six months.Lowcock said in a video briefing launching the new appeal that the poorest countries face “a double whammy” — the health impact of Covid-19 and “the impact of the global recession and the domestic measures taken to contain the virus.”“We must be prepared for a rise in conflict, hunger, poverty and disease as economies contract, export earnings, remittances and tourism disappear, and health systems are put under strain,” he warned. “Lockdowns and economic recession may mean a hunger pandemic ahead for millions.”The executive director of the World Food Program, David Beasley, said there are two keys to averting the possibility of 265 million people being on the brink of famine by the end of the year: providing money and keeping supply chains running smoothly.The U.N. appeals to wealthy nations for funding all the time, he said, but the pandemic is “a one-time phenomena, a catastrophe we’re hitting,” so it’s not unreasonable to ask the wealthiest people and the wealthiest companies to give.“I don’t mean just a few million. I’m talking about hundreds of millions of dollars, billions,” Beasley said.He also urged action to address the “breakdown of supply chains globally.” Nations must ensure “that we don’t have export-import bans, restrictions at borders, shutdown of ports, shutdown of distribution points,” he said, saying that some countries have already imposed export bans that are having ripple effects on food supplies.As an example, Beasley said that if young people in urban areas in Africa lose their jobs as a result of the economic impact of the pandemic, they don’t have bank accounts to fall back on. “And if they don’t have food, you’re going to have protests, riots, unrest and destabilization. It’s going to cost the world a hundredfold more to react after the fact,” he warned.He said that if the world doesn’t respond with sufficient funding, it will be catastrophic.“We’re facing famine of biblical proportions,” he said. “We can avert famine if we act and we act now.”The U.N.’s initial $2 billion appeal has so far raised $1 billion, including a lot from Europe — Germany, Britain, the European Commission — with contributions also from Japan, Persian Gulf countries, Canada and others, Lowcock said.The updated appeal adds nine vulnerable countries to the 54 nations covered in the initial appeal — Benin, Djibouti, Liberia, Mozambique, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sierra Leone, Togo and Zimbabwe.Lowcock said more countries are being monitored for addition to the list amid “a very fast-moving situation.”U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi said in the briefing that there has not been a major outbreak of Covid-19 in refugee camps, but warned that they have an “extraordinary vulnerability” that needs prevention efforts.Dr. Mike Ryan, who heads the World Health Organization’s emergencies operation, said that people in such camps can’t maintain physical distance and they have “underlying vulnerabilities” with no access to personal hygiene, safe water, sanitation, food and welfare.“That is the tinder in which this epidemic may explode,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-appeals-for-6-7-billion-to-fight-virus-in-poor-countries/story-FABE1vPtQiP0JxUgLsFU1K.html
08-05-2020||World||Senators urge Trump to temporarily suspend H-1B, other guest worker visas||Top Republican senators urged US President Donald Trump on Thursday to suspend all new guest worker visas for 60 days and certain categories of new guest worker visas, including H-1B, for at least a year or until unemployment figures return to normal levels.The unemployment figures in the US have reached an all-time high due to the coronavirus pandemic. The letter has been signed by Senators Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton, Chuck Grassley and Josh Hawley.“As you know, more than 33 million Americans have filed for unemployment coverage just since mid-March, and approximately one-fifth of the American workforce is currently out of work. This is a stunning difference compared with the historically-low nationwide unemployment rate of just 3.5 per cent in February this year,” they said in their letter to the president.The letter, dated May 7, specifically calls for suspension of all non-immigrant guest worker visas for the next 60 days, followed by a continued suspension of certain categories of new non-immigrant guest worker visas for a year or until the national unemployment figures return to normal levels.“To protect unemployed Americans in the early stages of economic recovery, we urge you to suspend all non-immigrant guest worker visas for the next 60 days,” the senators said.Exceptions to this suspension should be rare, limited to time-sensitive industries such as agriculture and issued only on a case-by-case basis, when the employers can demonstrate that they have been unable to find Americans to take the jobs, the senators wrote.After 60 days, the senators urged Trump to continue to suspend new non-immigrant guest workers for a year or until the national unemployment figures return to normal levels, whichever comes first.“That suspension should, at a minimum, include H-2B visas (non-agricultural seasonal workers), H-1B visas (specialty occupation workers) and the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program (extension of foreign student visas after graduation). We also urge you to suspend the EB-5 immigrant visa program, effective immediately,” the lawmakers wrote.The H-1B work visa for foreign technology professionals is highly popular among Indians and a large number of Indians also opt for the EB-5 investors visa.The senators argued that there is no reason why unemployed Americans and recent college graduates should have to compete in such a limited job market against an influx of additional H-1B workers, most of whom work in business, technology or STEM fields.“Temporarily suspending the issuance of new H-1B visas would also protect the hundreds of thousands of H-1B workers and their families already working in the United States -- workers who could otherwise be subject to deportation if they are laid off for more than 60 days,” they said.“Of course, appropriate exceptions could also be crafted to the H-1B program suspension to allow for doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals who wish to come to the United States to assist in combating the coronavirus pandemic,” the senators wrote.Additionally, the United States ought to suspend its Optional Practical Training (OPT) programme, which allows foreign students in the country to extend their stay after graduation for one to three years to get “experience in the field” by taking jobs here, they wrote.In 2019, more than 223,000 former foreign students had their OPT applications approved or extended. While the merits of such a programme are subject to debate, there is certainly no reason to allow foreign students to stay for three additional years just to take jobs that would otherwise go to unemployed Americans as the country’s economy recovers, the lawmakers said.The senators also urged Trump to remove the EB-5 visa from the exemptions in his Presidential Proclamation issued on April 22, at least until real reforms are adopted.The EB-5 programme has long been plagued by scandal and fraud, and criticised as effectively functioning as a pay-for-citizenship scheme in many cases. There is no reason that the programme should receive preferential treatment as opposed to other green card programmes for employment-based immigrants, the lawmakers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senators-urge-trump-to-temporarily-suspend-h-1b-other-guest-worker-visas/story-v5h96zpxEwQwv8t33XDQnN.html

08-05-2020||World||Governors disregarding White House guidelines on Covid-19 lockdown reopening: Report||Many governors across the US are disregarding or creatively interpreting White House guidelines in easing their states’ lockdowns and letting businesses reopen, an Associated Press analysis found.The AP determined that 17 states do not appear to meet one of the key benchmarks set by the White House for loosening up — a 14-day downward trajectory in new cases or infection rates. And yet many of those have begun to reopen or are about to do so, including Alabama, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Utah.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBecause of the broad way in which the nonbinding guidelines are written, other states, including Georgia, have technically managed to meet the criteria and reopen despite not seeing a steady decline in cases and deaths.Asked at the White House on Thursday about states that are reopening without meeting some of the federal government’s benchmarks, President Donald Trump said: “The governors have great power as to that, given by us. We want them to do that. We rely on them. We trust them. And hopefully they are making the right decisions.”The push to reopen across the country comes amid pressure from businesses that are collapsing by the day and workers who have been thrown out of a job. Over 33 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits over the past seven weeks, and a highly anticipated report on Friday is expected to show US unemployment as high as 16%, a level not seen since the Depression.Elsewhere around the world, the Bank of England projected that Britain’s economy will shrink by 14 percent this year, its biggest decline since 1706, when Europe was embroiled in the War of the Spanish Succession.The economic woes have affected even brand-name businesses, with Neiman Marcus filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the first US department store chain to be toppled by the outbreak.The reopening debate in the US echoes that underway in Europe, where regional and political rifts are emerging over how fast to lift the lid on the lockdowns.French mayors are resisting the government’s call to reopen schools, while Italian governors want Rome to ease lockdown measures faster. As the British government looks to reopen the economy, Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon has warned that acting too fast could let the virus wreak havoc again.Public health experts around the world have cautioned that reopening too soon, without widespread testing and tracing, could enable the virus to come surging back with tragic consequences.The US has recorded over 74,000 deaths and 1.2 million confirmed infections. But this week, University of Washington researchers nearly doubled their projection of deaths in the US to about 134,000 through early August, largely to reflect the loosenings of stay-at-home restrictions.When Trump announced the guidelines April 16, he declared a “new front in our war” and said he was “establishing clear scientific metrics and benchmarks on testing, new case growth and hospital capacity that must be met before advancing each phase.”Since then, many states have reopened while daily cases and infection rates have either plateaued or continued to climb, the AP analysis found. Some states are going it alone, using their own criteria, not the White House’s.The White House has not been specific about how states should calculate the 14-day downward trajectory. Depending on how you calculate it, a state might pass or fail. The AP analyzed counts of tests and confirmed cases compiled by Johns Hopkins University and looked at the numbers using a rolling seven-day average to account for day-to-day variability in test reporting.As governments grapple with when to restart their economies, the Trump administration has shelved a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention document with step-by-step advice to local authorities on how and when to reopen restaurants and other public places.The 17-page report with detailed instructions on what precautions to take was supposed to be published last Friday, but agency scientists were told it “would never see the light of day,” according to a CDC official who was not authorized to discuss the matter and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican, has eased some rules to allow salons, tattoo parlors and restaurants to reopen with restrictions in most counties. Churches were allowed to resume in-person services, weddings and funerals on Monday, with some restrictions.But both new cases and the rate of positive test results have increased in Nebraska in recent weeks. Ricketts said Wednesday that the number of new cases is a poor indicator because it is naturally going to increase as the state ramps up testing.He suggested that the lockdown restrictions are too drastic. “We could ban just about all deaths on the interstate by reducing the speed to 5 mph, but we don’t do that,” he said.Georgia has embarked on the most aggressive reopening schedule in the country. It has met one of the White House criteria by recording a decrease in the rate of positive test results, but it has seen nearly 600 more deaths and a hot spot in a poultry-processing area since Gov. Brian Kemp moved to ease business restrictions.The head of Utah’s response, Maj. Gen. Jeff Burton, has implemented a color-coded reopening system that was in the works before the White House issued its guidelines.“We had that plan long before there was a federal plan,” Burton said. “It’s a solid plan that lays out the road to recovery.”Among other things the White House guidelines say that before reopening, states should have a downward trend in flu and COVID-19-like illnesses for 14 days; hospitals should be able to treat all patients without crisis care; and robust testing should be in place for at-risk health workers.But there are few specifics, and the plan says local officials “may need to tailor the application of these criteria to local circumstances.”Of the 33 states that have had a 14-day downward trajectory of either cases or positivity rates, 25 are partially opened or moving to reopen within days, the AP analysis finds.Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Virginia and Wisconsin, which have not seen a 14-day decline in cases or rates of positive tests, remain closed despite meeting some other benchmarks.Many governors are focusing on the criteria that call for a reduction in the percentage of positive tests for COVID-19. Up to now, many states have been doing limited testing, typically on their sickest residents. The percentage of people testing positive has dropped as testing expanded to the broader population in recent weeks.Public health experts say the guidance from the top has been anything but clear. In addition to burying the CDC report, the Trump administration has tried to push responsibility for expanding testing capacity onto the states.“We’re a federalist society, so some of the blame goes to the governors and some of the blame goes to the president. But the responsibility for coordinating and enforcing and implementing a national plan comes from the White House,” said Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University.He likened it to “an orchestra without a conductor.”Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 3.8 million people and killed over a quarter-million, by Johns Hopkins’ count, which experts agree understates the dimensions of the pandemic because of limited testing, differences in counting the dead and concealment by some governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/governors-disregarding-white-house-guidelines-on-covid-19-lockdown-reopening-report/story-3x1gvo7E0AJW7Eg4Kf12OP.html

08-05-2020||World||US jobless numbers rise by another 3.2 million amid Covid-19 pandemic||Nearly 3.2 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, which reflected a continued drop from the peak in April but was still a record, taking up the total of job losses caused by the Covid-19 epidemic in the United States to 33.5 million, according to new data released Thursday.Before March, when the epidemic which President Donald Trump has said has been the “worst attack” in US history, worse than the 1942 Pearl Harbor attack and the September 11 terrorist attacks got under way, the number of claims for unemployment benefits had been historically 700,000 a week, going back several decades.Though 3.2 million marked continued reduction following 3.8 million the week before and way below the peak of 6.9 million applications filed in late March. The cumulative figure for the past month due Friday are expected to be far grimmer, wiping out job gains of several decades.Layoffs started mid-March as the country began to be shut down state by state to enforce social-distancing and other mitigation efforts to combat the coronavirus epidemic. Restaurants, theatres, shopping mall, saloon closed, manufacturing slowed and travel and hospitality industry were crippled.The epidemic’s devastating impact on the economy is telling on families. New research released Wednesday by the Hamilton Project showed unprecedented levels of food insecurity in the United States. One in five children are not getting enough to eat, was one of the grim findings of the study.At least 42 states have opened up or eased restriction to varying degrees in recent days. But the Wall Street Journal said citing economists that it will be months before US employers begin hiring consistently again and years before the millions of jobs lost thus far will be fully replaced.President Trump, who has cheered on the reopening, expressed growing frustration with the havoc wreaked by the epidemic, and called it the “worst attack” in US history.“This is worse than Pearl Harbor. This is worse than the World Trade Center,” the president told reporters, referring to two pivotal events n US history. The Pearl Harbor attack in 1942 drew the United States into the Second World War and the 9/11 attacks triggered the longest in US history, in Afghanistan. — more people had died in either instance, than the toll from Covid-19 thus far.US toll shot up by 2,367 deaths in the last 24 hours, marking a return to more than 2,000 after days of dipping numbers, to 73,435; and by 24,254 new infections to 1.22 million infections. While the daily toll had ebbed in recent days, the number of infections has hovered around and above 20,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-numbers-rise-by-another-3-2-million-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-Cj93jgUSUtQmIcoGwS4r6M.html
08-05-2020||World||WHO cautions against use of Madagascar anti-virus potion||The World Health Organization on Thursday advised governments to clinically test a herbal drink touted by Madagascar’s President Andry Rajoelina as a remedy against coronavirus. The Covid-Organics infusion is derived from artemisia -- a plant with proven anti-malarial properties -- and other indigenous herbs.Rajoelina hopes to distribute the infusion across West Africa and beyond, claiming it cures COVID-19 patients within 10 days.Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Niger have already received consignments of the potion. Others such as Tanzania have expressed interest.But the World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly warned that there are no published scientific studies of the herbal tea and that its effects have not been tested.“We would caution and advise countries against adopting a product that has not been taken through tests to see its efficacy,” WHO Africa Director Matshidiso Moeti said in a press briefing on Thursday, calling on Madagascar to take the drink “through a clinical trial”.Moeti said that in 2000, African governments had committed to taking “traditional therapies” through the same clinical trials as other medication.“I can understand the need, the drive to find something that can help,” Moeti said. “But we would very much like to encourage this scientific process in which the governments themselves made a commitment.”South Africa’s Health Minister Zweli Mkhize on Wednesday said Madagascar had reached out for “help” with scientific research.“Our scientists would be able to assist with this research,” Mkhize tweeted, adding that South Africa would only “get involved in a scientific analysis of the herb”.The country has the highest number of coronavirus cases in sub-Saharan Africa, with 7,808 infections and 153 fatalities recorded to date.Neighbouring eSwatini -- a tiny landlocked nation wedged between South Africa and Mozambique -- said it would not consider Rajoelina’s tonic for the time being.“It is important as a country to first ascertain where such herbal products have been tested,” she said Health Minister Lizzie Nkosi on Thursday. “We have to do adequate proper research and be sure that the product works.”To date eSwatini has reported 123 cases of coronavirus, including two deaths.Meanwhile, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has debunked claims that it had ordered a package of Covid-Organics from a “third country”.“We are aware that several claims of a COVID-19 cure have been made in different parts of the world,” ECOWAS said in a statement on Wednesday.“But we can only support and endorse products that have been shown to be effective through scientific study.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-cautions-against-use-of-madagascar-anti-virus-potion/story-oAcsFtSTJR1rYDU74TxUzJ.html

If it happens the state would register 10,000 cases in just 9 days, after breaching the 10,000-case mark on April 30, with a total of 10,498 cases. It crossed 15,000 cases on May 5 when the total of the Covid-19 cases was 15,525.The mortality rate in the state stood at 3.86%, down from 7.21% on April 12, but the number of deaths is increasing, with 362 deaths in the past ten days.

Mumbai has seen 4,455 cases and 196 deaths in the period.The tragic rail accident killing 16 migrant workers in Aurangabad on Friday morning led to a blame game between governments. The state government has blamed it on the Centre for the delay in response to the state’s demand for special trains for the evacuation of migrants. But at the same time, the authorities are facing the criticism within for the failure of the district administration in putting the migrants in shelter camps.“Allowing the migrants to walk on the highways and railway track was a big flaw in the system. They were walking for the last four-five days on the highways in the absence of means to travel back to their homes. They should have been given confidence about the travelling arrangements to return,” said a minister requesting anonymity.The ruling Congress and Nationalist Congress Party have criticized BJP-ruled states like Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka alleging that the states have been refusing entry to the migrants going back from Maharashtra. Congress leader and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said on Friday that that owing to the delay in the permissions from other states the evacuation has been delayed. “We have more than 10 lakh migrant workers who want to go back to their respective states. 32 Shramik trains have so far departed from various stations in Maharashtra, but a few states are not giving permission as quickly as expected. The entire process of sending these migrants is intricate and time consuming and needs quick response from the receiving states,” Thorat said.The expert committee of bureaucrats including retired IAS officers constituted to suggest the steps for the revival of the state economy submitted its report to the state government on Friday. The committee has suggested, among others, for the earmarking of the ‘Negative’ list of activities than ‘Permitted’ list during lockdown to outline the non-containment zones. It has stated that it will help in boosting business activities. It has suggested that the list be based on activities precluding social distancing and the activities that are not very critical for economy.The committee has also recommended emphasis on Mumbai by launching a special project to re-start the economy and has also suggested a special programme to support vulnerable groups like street vendors, drivers, and self employed service providers. It has also recommended addressing individual sectors and activities and new business classes. Deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar said that the report will now be kept before the state cabinet for a final nod.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-inches-towards-20-000-mark-with-1-089-new-covid-19-cases-today/story-0662foK22AzPSHDaD2GPbN.html

He said the mission entrusted to him “highlights the very high significance of steadfast friendship, solidarity and cooperation between India and Sri Lanka, two of the closest maritime neighbours in South Asia and the Indian Ocean region”, according to a statement from the Indian high commission.Baglay reiterated India’s commitment to share its resources with friends and partners at a time when many countries are facing a scarcity of medical products due to the Covid-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions. He later assumed his duties while observing health protocols.In a separate development, India said on Friday it is dispatching packages of medicines, including hydroxychloroquine, paracetamol and other drugs, to more than 25 countries in Africa to fight Covid-19.“This is in keeping with India’s traditionally strong bonds of friendship and solidarity with Africa, which has reached new heights in the last few years,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement.Prime Minister Modi had a telephone conversation with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is the current chairperson of the African Union, on April 17 and conveyed India’s full support for the joint African effort against the Coronavirus. Modi also spoke with Ugandan President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni on April 9 and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on May 6.During April, external affairs minister S Jaishankar spoke to his counterparts in several African countries to reiterate India’s solidarity in the fight against Covid-19 and offered them all assistance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-envoy-designate-to-sri-lanka-flies-to-colombo-with-medical-supplies/story-A7revOj3aiCsuRWPhh2lOP.html

Sudhir said a second Navy ship INS Magar will leave for Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu on Sunday with 200 Indians. He said the exercise will be repeated next week by the Indian Navy warships. The first Naval ship from Male is expected to arrive at the Cochin Port on May 10, Port Trust officials in Kochi said.The INS Jalashwa is part of the repatriation mission launched by the Indian Navy to bring Indian citizens home from foreign shores, the Indian Navy said in a statement. Immigration procedures of the passengers were carried out in the Hulhumale’ Ferry Terminal in Male City. “Fantastic job by the entire team of @VelanaAirport for the safe repatriation of Indian nationals!” the high commission tweeted. The massive evacuation exercise is testimony to Maldives-India friendship, it said in another tweet. Several Indians who are travelling by the warship lauded the evacuation plan launched by the government.“It is a very great thing that the High Commission did for us and we did not have any issues till now. We got everything with proper guidelines, all the things done by the High Commission,” Pradeep, who hails from Palakkad, said. He works in a resort in Male.“Jamsheed from Kerala thanks Govt of India, Govt of Kerala & @indiannavy for this historic Operation to repatriate #Indian nationals from the #Maldives,” the High Commission of India in Maldives tweeted.The INS Jalashwa is properly equipped with relief materials, Covid-19 protection gear along with medical and administrative support staff, it noted.Amidst the coronavirus pandemic, India is conducting its biggest ever repatriation exercise named Vande Bharat Mission to bring back stranded Indians from abroad, including from the US, the UAE and the UK.The High Commission in Male on its Facebook page said, MVR 600 or an equivalent amount of USD 40 will be charged as the Evacuation Services Charge from each person listed for repatriation by INS Jalashwa.“This amount would be collected at the service fee collection counter after completion of the Immigration process at the Velana International Airport. Kindly carry exact change to avoid delay/ inconvenience,” the post said.Meanwhile, all arrangements as per government guidelines are in place at Cochin Port to facilitate the arrival of those who are evacuated from Maldives via the sea route, officials in Kochi said.Before arrival at Cochin, on board the vessel, the Navy will get the self e-declaration data filled by all passengers and also identify the passengers symptomatic of Covid-19.The symptomatic passengers will be disembarked first, followed by other passengers (district wise) in batches of 50 persons, the Port Trust said.Separate zone has been earmarked for the symptomatic patients.The passengers disembarked will undergo further statutory verifications for clearances inside the Samudrika Cruise Terminal where Port Health Organisation will verify the self declaration forms, the Port Trust said.All passengers on arrival in India will be medically screened and would have to download and register on the Aarogya Setu app.On Monday, the Indian government announced plans to begin a phased repatriation of its citizens stranded abroad from May 7.On Thursday, two special flights from the UAE carrying a total of 363 Indian nationals, including nine infants, left for Kerala as India began its biggest ever repatriation exercise to bring back its citizens stranded abroad.

Issues such as the WHO’s mandate and an investigation of its working can be taken up later, when we have dealt with the immediate issue,” said one of the people cited above.During the prime minister’s recent conversations with heads of state and government and in external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s discussions with his counterparts, the focus has been on combating Covid-19 and finding solutions to the worldwide crisis, the people said.“All our conversations with heads of state or government or with foreign ministers have been about how to cooperate to deal with the crisis and work together to develop vaccines and therapeutic solutions,” the first person said.“The conversations have also been about reliable supply chains that can be of use to states,” the person added.The people, however, made it clear that India wants to see the WHO’s mandate strengthened. India also wants to work with others on ways to increase the WHO’s capacity to handle pandemics and crises, they added.“These are issues we can come to when we have more breathing space to deal with them,” the person added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reforming-who-can-be-taken-up-after-overcoming-covid-19-pandemic-india/story-d8t0C0fZEmgnKSgnWPtgUM.html

There is a need for relaxing certain provisions of the Factories Act, 1948 thereby extending the working hours for optimum utilization of the workers in the factories which have been allowed to operate during the shutdown. The Pramod Sawant-led government’s decision comes a day after Madhya Pradesh took a similar decision, increasing the factory shifts from eight to 12 hours in view of the Covid-19 outbreak.As per the relaxations granted, the total number of hours of work in any day shall not exceed twelve while spread over, inclusive of intervals for rest, shall not exceed thirteen hours in any one day. The total number of hours of work in any week, including overtime has also been amended to reflect the change and now shall not exceed sixty. It is also mandated that no worker shall work for more than five hours before he has had an interval of at least half an hour and that where a worker works in a factory for more than forty-eight hours in any week, s/he shall, in respect of overtime work, be entitled to wages at the rate of twice his ordinary rate of wages.The Centre recently announced relaxation in curbs during nationwide lockdown to revive the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-goa-allows-factories-to-have-12-hour-shifts-due-to-shortage-of-workers/story-Hd3GglmylYmEryZ7EOYqBJ.html

These workers are expected to return to work in rice mills across the state.State civil supplies minister Gangula Kamalakar, Civil Supplies Corporation chairman M Srinivas Reddy, Rytu Bandhu chairman P Rajeshwar Reddy and state nodal officer Sandeep Kumar Sultania received them at Lingampally station and offered them flowers and biscuit packets.Normally, these workers go to their native villages when the agricultural operations in the state are in full swing and return to Telangana to work in rice mills only after the harvesting season. This time, too, these workers had left for their native places much before the lockdown was enforced but were held up in their states.Cyberabad police commissioner VC Sajjanar said the migrant workers would work in rice mills in Miryalaguda, Nalgonda, Karimnagar, Jagitial, Peddapalli, Sultanabad, Siddipet, Mancherial and several other places in Telangana. They were sent to their respective destinations in buses arranged by the state road transport corporation.Masks were provided and physical distance was maintained in the trains and buses.On the other hand, thousands of migrant labourers from different parts of Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have been demanding that the Telangana government make arrangements for their return to their native places.Though Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao announced that 40 special trains would be engaged everyday to ferry migrant workers to their respective states for one week, it could not keep its commitment as the other state governments had not given approval to accept these workers.Telangana chief secretary Somesh Kumar said so far, the state government could engage only 13 trains in three days. As per the standard operating protocol of the railways, no trains can be operated to other states to transport workers, unless these states allow them.“We have written letters to these state governments to allow trains carrying workers from their respective states. Once we get the clearance, we shall ferry the workers,” he said.Out of 2.61 lakh migrant workers who had registered their names with the police stations in their respective areas, only around 25,000 workers had been sent to their native places. Out of them, nearly 2.49 lakh workers are present within Greater Hyderabad limits.“I have been going to Gachibowli police station to know about the fate of the special train for the last one week. But the police are sending me back. How long should I wait?” asked Ram Vilas, a construction labourer from Katihar district in Bihar.For the last two days, hundreds of migrant workers have been thronging the police stations making similar enquiries. “They are not allowing us to go to our native places even on foot, nor are they making any alternative travel arrangements,” lamented Sunil Kumar from Gorakhpur.The Cyberabad police commissioner said it would take some time for the government to transport so many migrant labourers in view of limited number of trains and lack of consent from their respective state governments.He pointed out that labour-intensive activities like construction, industries have been started in Telangana. “As all the states are dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, all the people going there will be put under quarantine after medical examination. So, it is better for them to stay back and take part in the work to earn money,” Sajjannar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-reverse-migration-225-workers-from-bihar-return-to-telangana-to-work-in-rice-mills/story-aXJD7McGSLhb5A3zFoRdbO.html

They will no longer have to trek for five to six days,” said a senior government official. The new road is an extension of the Pithoragarh-Tawaghat-Ghatiabagarh road.Defence minister Rajnath Singh said the new road link will allow pilgrims to complete the Yatra in just one week compared to two to three weeks it took earlier. He inaugurated the road through video conferencing.“While combating Covid-19 pandemic, the BRO in Uttarakhand has connected Kailash Mansarovar route to Lipulekh pass at a ht of 17,060 ft; thus providing connectivity to border villages and security forces,” the minister said on Twitter.“The arduous trek through treacherous high-altitude terrain can now be avoided. At present, the travel to Kailash-Mansarovar takes around two to three weeks through Sikkim or Nepal routes. The Lipulekh route had a trek of 90 km and the elderly yartris faced lot of difficulties,” the statement said.The routes through Sikkim and Nepal require the pilgrims to travel 20% of their journey on Indian roads and 80% on Chinese roads. “With the opening of new road, this ratio has been reversed. Now pilgrims will traverse 84% land journey on Indian roads and only 16% in China,” the defence ministry said.Singh said with the crucial road link had fulfilled the decades-old dreams and aspirations of local people and pilgrims.BRO chief Lieutenant General Harpal Singh said the construction of the road was a challenging task due to a raft of factors such as constant snow fall, high altitude and extremely low temperatures --- factors that restricted the annual working season to five months.One of the biggest challenges for the BRO is to arrange a large labour force to carry out construction of key roads and tunnels in far-flung areas as Covid-19 sweeps through the country, as reported by Hindustan Times on April 28.The BRO’s peak working season extends from May to November. Migrant workers are a key part of the BRO’s workforce involved in building strategic roads, along the country’s northern border with China, scattered across Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bro-makes-kailash-mansarovar-yatra-easier-for-pilgrims/story-4PPuxKOVbXRsVLWhC1gJpO.html

I appeal to the migrant labourers that they should not get restless. We are in touch with various states. Keep your patience for a few more days. Maharashtra government is with you,” Uddhav said.Uddhav’s assurance follows a similar appeal by Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who said the state government was in the process of bringing back stranded labourers from other states. He pointed out that about 80,000 workers had already been repatriated.“I will like to make an appeal to all the labourers stranded in other states to stay where they are. The state government is making all arrangements to bring them back,” he said.The bodies of the migrant labourers will now be brought back to Madhya Pradesh after Chouhan spoke to Uddhav and Railways minister Piyush Goyal, requesting for a special train to bring back their bodies. Four others who were injured in the incident are under treatment.The labourers who were killed in the accident belonged to Shahdol and Umaria districts in Madhya Pradesh, said state police.Also Read: Aurangabad train accident: Loco pilot blew horn to warn labourers, says ministryThe Railways has announced a comprehensive probe into the accident which took place at 5.15 am near Karmad, around 30 km from Aurangabad.Madhya Pradesh government has announced of Rs 5 lakh each for the kin of the deceased as ex-gratia amount.

Additional director general of police Rajiv Singh said their preliminary investigation found they came here seven months ago.“We came here in search of daily-wage work seven months ago.

08-05-2020||India||Complete Babri trial against LK Advani, others by August 31: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Friday ordered the special judge conducting a criminal trial against BJP leaders LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti in the Babri Masjid demolition case to complete the proceedings and deliver judgment by August 31. The top court also asked special judge SK Yadav to make use of video conferencing facilities to ensure that recording of evidence is complete and there is no inordinate delay in concluding the trial.“We may indicate that video conferencing facilities are available and should be used by Shri Yadav in order to complete all evidence…We extend the period to complete evidence and deliver judgment till August 31”, the bench headed by justice Rohinton Nariman said after the special judge wrote to the court on May 6 stating that recording of evidence is yet to be completed.This would be the third time the court is setting a deadline for completion of trial in the 28-year-old case. The BJP leaders are on trial for the 1992 demolition of Babri Masjid at Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh. They have been charged for various offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that include promoting enmity between religious groups (section 153A), making statements affecting national integration (section 153B) or which are likely to cause public mischief (section 505).In April 2017, the top court had ordered that additional charges of criminal conspiracy under section 120B of the IPC should be framed against the accused BJP leaders. BJP leader Kalyan Singh, who was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when the Babri Masjid was demolished and who is one of the accused in the case, was given immunity by the top court under Article 361 of the Constitution since he was the Governor of Rajasthan. Article 361 affords protection to the President and Governor from criminal proceedings when in office.The apex court had also ordered the special court to complete trial within two years.However, the matter was taken up again by the Supreme Court in July 2019 after the special judge sought additional time to complete the trial and deliver his judgment. The apex court allowed the same and extended the deadline by 9 more months.The deadline expired on April 19 and the special judge Yadav wrote to the apex court on May 6 seeking further extension of time.The court then listed the case on Friday and decided to extend the deadline one last time.“We are cognisant of the fact that Shri Yadav is making all efforts in order that the trial reach a just conclusion. However, given the original time frame and the extended time frame, the effort must now be to complete the proceedings and deliver judgment latest by August 31,” the Supreme Court said.In its historic verdict on November 9 last year in the Babri demolition case, the court decided the title suit in favour of Hindu parties while also acknowledging that the demolition of the masjid which stood at the site was a “calculated act.”“During the pendency of the suits, the entire structure of the mosque was brought down in a calculated act of destroying a place of public worship. The Muslims have been wrongly deprived of a mosque which had been constructed well over 450 years ago”, the November 9 judgment said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/complete-babri-trial-against-lk-advani-others-by-august-31-supreme-court/story-uNZIpR2DDn3UGMBdJta94J.html

On Thursday, the state recorded eight new cases and three more were registered on Friday, taking the state tally to 56.Seven of the 11 new cases in the last two days were detected in Silchar among returnees from Ajmer, but a couple among the other four found positive in Guwahati had no contact or travel history.“From these cases, we can clearly assume there is spread of coronavirus infection in Guwahati. That is why I request the public to immediately call 104 or get in touch with our healthcare personnel if they have symptoms of dry cough, fever, respiratory issues and diarrhoea,” Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Friday.The two Guwahati cases to have triggered an alarm include a 16-year-old girl who was detected to be Covid-19 positive after her death on Thursday and a 55-year-old woman. The other two cases include a doctor enrolled in MD course at Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH) who was involved in the screening of Covid-19 patients at the hospital and the fourth person had returned from West Bengal on May 6.“We are sorry that since her disease couldn’t be detected earlier, the 16-year-old passed away. It is also unfortunate that the PG student who was involved in screening Covid-19 patients in GMCH was found positive,” Sarma said.Authorities have closed GMCH, the biggest hospital in Assam, for new patients till May 10 in order to sanitize the premises. A total of 386 persons including two GMCH professors, doctors, students, nurses and attendants have been placed in quarantine and their swabs taken for tests.The two hostels at GMCH for the PG students have been declared containment zones.

The first two flights from the UAE arrived in Kerala on Thursday.During the second week of the repatriation programme, there will be greater use of feeder flights both outside the country and within India, the people said. For instance, feeder flights could bring Indians stranded in Latin American countries to a point in the US for a return flight to India.“The main issue is the commercial viability of the operations to ensure what Air India does is self-sustaining. The flights are being operated at cost and this is not a profit-making venture,” the person cited above said, explaining why the government opted to charge for ferrying stranded nationals back to India.Noting that the government hadn’t charged for previous evacuation flights, the person added, “In the past, evacuations were from conflict zones and in emergency situations. Now, we are talking about a repatriation of people who want to return to India.“They have the means to return. They are studying and working abroad, they will finance their own return to India at minimum cost.”The people said the cost of tickets from West Asian states, for instance, were reasonable when compared to the rates of airlines from other countries that are currently operating. The government is also trying to increase the viability of Air India’s operations by allowing people on outbound flights provided they long-term visas or residency permits and the destination countries are willing to receive them, the people said.The external affairs ministry’s online platform, on which requests received by Indian missions from citizens wanting to return are regularly uploaded, has so far recorded a total of 67,833 requests. About 34% requests or about 22,500 were from students, 30% or nearly 16,000 from migrant workers, 9,250 from short-term visa holders whose visas had expired, more than 5,500 from people with medical emergencies or seeking treatment for terminal illnesses, more than 4,000 from stranded tourists, more than 3,000 from pregnant women and the elderly and more than 1,100 from people who wanted to return due to a death in the family.These repatriation requests were from Kerala, which topped the list with more than 25,200; Tamil Nadu, with some 6,600; Maharashtra, with about 4,300; Uttar Pradesh, with more than 3,715; Rajasthan, with more than 3,300; and Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Delhi, all with more than 2,000 requests each.On Thursday, an Air India flight from Abu Dhabi to Kochi brought back 181 people while another Air India flight from Dubai to Kozhikode returned with 182 passengers. On Friday, an Air India flight from Singapore to Delhi returned with 234 passengers while another flight from Dhaka to Srinagar brought back 168 passengers.There will be a total of 27 flights from West Asia during the first week of Vande Bharat, including 11 from the UAE, five each from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and two each from Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.During the same period, there will be seven flights from Bangladesh to bring back nationals to Srinagar, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai. There will be another 14 flights from Southeast Asia, including five each from Singapore and the Philippines and four from Malaysia.There will also be seven flights in the first week from four airports in the US – New York, Washington, Chicago and San Francisco, and seven more flights from London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vande-bharat-mission-to-be-expanded-to-russia-central-asia-europe-in-2nd-week/story-EprVKFYb9xDBTRgxbqcSbO.html
08-05-2020||India||Give credit facilities, MGNREGA job cards to women: NCW advisory to states||The National Commission for Women (NCW) is preparing an advisory for all the states prescribing drastic policy changes that will aid women farmers, who are grappling with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.The decision was taken following a day-long virtual consultation that was held on Friday.NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma told HT that policy rethinks were the need of the hour after a vast section of women also went back to their respective native places during the lockdown restrictions, which the government imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19 outbreak.One of the key takeaways of the discussion was that though a significant section of Indian farmers are women, access to credit facilities, subsidies and even agricultural tools for women are few and far between.“Most of the land is registered in the name of male farmers, which make women ineligible for credit facilities and state subsidies. Besides, farming tools are designed only for men,” Sharma said.The skewed gender policy makes procuring of both seeds and loans difficult for women farmers, she added.The stakeholders urged the NCW to issue an advisory to all the states to ensure women get access to credit without any interest or collateral, as many don’t hold land titles and some are sharecroppers.Another suggestion was made to provide women with job cards under a scheme such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA).The stakeholders advocated that women must get these opportunities amid a competitive labour market because many male migrant workers have headed home due to the loss of their livelihood triggered by the Covid-19 induced lockdown restrictions and a battered economy. It was also suggested a universal public distribution scheme (PDS) could be implemented coupled with bridging the gender wage gap in the farm sector.The percentage of women farmers and farm labourers is open to debate. An Oxfam report has cited that 70% of Indian cultivators and agriculture labourers are women, while a 2011 report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) had pegged the figure at 30%.The 2017-18 Economic Survey pointed at the “feminisation” of the agriculture sector, as more women took up farm jobs.Seema Kulkarni of Mahila Kisan Adhikaar Manch (MAAKAM), who took part in the virtual discussions on Friday, said that widows of farmers, who committed suicides, are the most vulnerable amid the pandemic during this kharif season.“These widows haven’t sold their harvests. They have neither seed availability nor access to any resource. Loan waivers, too, haven’t been sanctioned, as most of them receive loans through self-help groups and microfinance that charge exorbitant rates of interest. The process of sanctioning loans needs to be institutionalised. Besides, a list of vulnerable women needs to be compiled on a priority basis,” she said.In January, MAKAAM had written to the Centre to write off farm loan debts and provide a monthly pension of Rs 5,000. It had also batted for MGNREGA job cards for women affected by farm loan suicides. The officials from the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development, department of agriculture, National Rural Livelihood Mission, National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, PM Kisan, and National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj and also representatives of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Oxfam, and MAAKAM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/give-credit-facilities-mgrega-job-cards-to-women-ncw-advisory-to-states/story-hiZb7GtJWVtDKY2eunxreL.html

He said it might take another 48 hours.With regards to the gas leak, he said it occurred during maintenance in preparation to restart production halted during the lockdown.At a review meeting in the morning, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy directed the officials to identify hazardous factories in and around Visakhapatnam located in densely populated areas. He asked for a comprehensive roadmap to make Visakhapatnam a risk-free city by shifting hazardous industries to places far away from habitations.Also Read: Andhra Pradesh gas leak: NGT slaps interim penalty of Rs 50 cr on LG Polymers IndiaThe chief minister instructed the officials to immediately release ex-gratia of Rs 1 crore to each of the families of the deceased, Rs 10 lakh to each patient on ventilator, Rs 1 lakh each to other patients and Rs 25,000 to those who underwent treatment.Health minister Alla Nani said the government was immersed in the relief and rehabilitation process including evacuation and rehabilitation on a war-footing of 1,500 villagers in the vicinity of LG Polymers plant soon after the news of the leakage was received. He said 554 victims were shifted to hospitals and 128 admitted persons have completely recovered. 305 patients, including 52 infants, are being treated at the King George Hospital. There are 121 others, who are being treated at private hospitals and are out of danger. As of now, nobody was on ventilator support. The government would provide complete medical support to all of them, he added.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vizag-gas-leak-5-member-panel-to-probe-lapses-neutralising-styrene-gas-to-take-more-time/story-cczF6cP76CZz30jOtIlP2K.html

No 223 of May 5 and also the norms stipulated by TASMAC and the court.While submitting some photographs and visuals of media reports, he said: “It is reported through visual media that officials of TASMAC and as well as the Police officials were unprepared to manage overcrowding at the shops.” Six hundred new Covid-19 positive cases, including 399 in Chennai, were reported in the state today, said state health minister C Vijayabaskar.The resumption of liquor sales in the state was welcomed with bursting of crackers and distribution of cakes by some boisterous booze lovers as consumers lined up in front of the stores since early morning to get their quota.Opposing the move to reopen the liquor stores, DMK president M K Stalin, clad in black, held a placard and a black flag in front of his house, claiming that opening of liquor shops would lead to further increase in the spread of coronavirus.The government had defended the move citing opening up of liquor stores in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka and people going there in large numbers to buy booze.Even before the shops were opened at 10 am in non- containment zones, the queue extended upto a few kilometers in several localities including those that fall under Cuddalore, Villupuram, Kancheepuram, Chengelpet and Tiruvallur districts.Store workers sported masks and gloves while dispensing alcoholic beverages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/liquor-to-be-sold-only-through-online-or-door-delivery-orders-madras-hc/story-QgEBfbCmPp4nxQfTYKF1mI.html
08-05-2020||India||Mandatory BCG vaccination may make Covid-19 less virulent in India: Study||After scanning Covid-19 data of 29 countries across the world, a group of city-based researchers has suggested that factors such as BCG vaccination in developing nations like India have led to a situation where the rate of contamination and fatality from the disease is less than that in the developed world.The bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccine has a documented protective effect against meningitis and disseminated TB in children, according to the World Health Organisation. It is part of the mandatory childhood immunization programme in many countries including India.“Our research showed that the rate of affected people is significantly lower in countries like ours than developed nations which did not make BCG vaccination mandatory,” said Prof Arindam Banik, director of a management institute, who led the group of four researchers from reputed institutes.“Such vaccination somehow dilutes the virulence of novel coronavirus and develops immunity among a large number of people,” he told PTI.Besides India, infants in countries like Portugal, Turkey, South Korea, Indonesia, Egypt and Ethiopia get BCG vaccination and all these countries have witnessed less Covid-19 cases. Whereas in the USA, Italy and the UK where that vaccination is not mandatory, a large number of people were afflicted with the disease, Banik said.The findings will come out in a prestigious journal soon.To calculate the rate of novel coronavirus infected people, the researchers took into account 45 days starting from the day the first such case was reported in a country and then divided its population by the number of Covid-19 cases.“The 45-day period varies from one country to another.If the starting point is February-end for Italy, it is early March for England, mid-January for China and March-end for India,” Banik told PTI.Asked about the contention by many health experts that the rate of affected people in India is no way less than countries like the US and the UK, Banik said epidemiologists divide the total number of affected with total number of tests and that shows the figure on the higher side.“We are confident that the Covid-19 situation will not be as severe in the later phase as in Europe where black, Asian migrants were the worst-hit as the healthcare system was less accessible to them,” he said.Besides BCG vaccination, the academician said, they analysed other factors that determine the fatality rates across 29 economies spread across both the developing and developed world.“We have explored various econometric models. Based on available data, our study revealed that factors such as public health system, population age structure, poverty level and BCG vaccination are powerful contributory factors in determining fatality rates among those afflicted with novel coronavirus,” he said.The findings also indicate that population age structure can lead to high fatality rate across countries.“The study shows that the population above 65 are at significant risk from Covid-19 contagion. Such findings are more consistent in the context of Europe. According to a WHO report, top 30 countries with the largest percentage of over- 65 population, all barring Japan are the member states in Europe and these countries are severely affected by Covid-19,” he said.Evidence shows that over 95 per cent of those died there are more than 65 years of age and over 50 per cent of all deaths were people aged 80 years or older, he said.“The WHO report also suggests that 8 out of 10 deaths are occurring in individuals with at least one underlying co- morbidity condition, particular those with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and diabetes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mandatory-bcg-vaccination-may-make-covid-19-less-virulent-in-india-study/story-iMvOo11WpAomquZMBi4jRP.html

08-05-2020||India||Over 400 stranded Indians flown back home from Bangladesh, Singapore||Over 400 stranded Indians, including medical students, were brought back home on Friday from Bangladesh and Singapore in two Air India aircraft as part of the government’s mega repatriation mission Vande Bharat.The first flight from Singapore landed at the Delhi airport around 11.45 am with 234 passengers, senior officials said.Within a couple of hours, the second special flight with 167 students arrived at the Srinagar airport from Dhaka.The Indian government on Monday had announced phased repatriation from May 7 of its citizens stranded abroad. It said Air India will operate 64 flights till May 13 to bring back around 15,000 Indians stranded abroad due to the coronavirus lockdown.India imposed a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus in the country, grounding all domestic and international flights since late March.After the returnees reached IGI airport, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said all arrangements have been made for the Indians coming from other countries.“Delhi govt has made all arrangements for the Indians arriving from abroad,” he tweeted.All the arriving passengers were put through screening and triaging to find out any infection of coronavirus.After immigration and customs formalities, they headed towards paid quarantine facilities where they will spend 14 days, before going home.Officials in Srinagar said the 167 medical students underwent screening at the airport before they were sent to administrative quarantine for a period of 14 days as mandated under the guidelines issued for curbing the spread of COVID-19.Srinagar Deputy Commissioner Shahid Iqbal Chaudhary expressed his gratitude to the Indian High Commission in Dhaka for the “tremendous efforts” in getting these students home.“Profound gratitude to Indian High Commission @ihcdhaka for tremendous efforts. More to follow. For convenience of students -- bulk tickets next,” Chaudhary said in a tweet. The High Commission of India in Bangladesh had launched a dedicated link on its website for the registration for Indians wishing to return home. High Commissioner Riva Ganguly Das interacted with the students at the airport as they prepared to complete the formalities to fly back home.“It (the flight) is carrying only students. The students are enrolled in medical colleges in the country. We were in constant touch with them and their colleges have also taken good care of them,” she said in Dhaka prior to the departure.She further said that a total of seven flights will be operated from Dhaka.Strict precautionary measures were taken to ensure social distancing when the Indians arrived at the IGI airport. The returnees waved, smiled and gave thumbs-up to waiting mediapersons as they were taken to quarantine facilities in buses.“Those from Delhi will stay at 8-10 hotels that have been readied in New Delhi, South and South East Delhi as well as Aerocity, as paid quarantine facilities,” said a government official.Nearly 20 buses, including of DTC and neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab, were deployed at IGI airport for carrying people to quarantine facilities.According to standard operating procedure of the government for Indians arriving at IGI airport, resident commissioners and nodal officers will take care of people of their respective states regarding transport and quarantine facilities.Several medical teams drawn from municipal corporations, New Delhi Municipal Council, and Rao Tula Ram Memorial Hospital were deployed for screening the passengers from Singapore.Meanwhile, an Air India flight with around 200 Indians from Sharjah will arrive in Lucknow on Saturday night, A K Sharma, director of the Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport, said. Over 700 Indians are also being evacuated by sea from the Maldives who were stranded in the scenic island due to the COVID-19 linked international travel restrictions.The Indian Navy’s amphibious warship INS Jalashwa reached Male on Thursday to undertake the massive repatriation mission named ‘Operation Samudra Setu’, the High Commission of India in Maldives said.The first Naval ship from Male is expected to arrive at the Cochin Port on May 10, Port Trust officials in Kochi said.The INS Jalashwa is properly equipped with relief materials, COVID-19 protection gear along with medical and administrative support staff.The INS Magar, an amphibious warfare vessel of the Indian Navy, will also join the repatriation mission in Male as part of the efforts to bring back around 1,000 stranded Indian nationals to the Kochi port in Kerala over the next few days.

In view of this all, the SPCBs should ensure immediate compliance of the advisory,” the note said.The SPCBs will have to ensure that pollution control equipment, connectivity of online emissions monitoring systems with the CPCB and state board servers, effluent treatment plants, including safety equipment, are kept in operational conditions before resuming operations after the lockdown restrictions are lifted.“The boards shall ensure that all units take utmost care in handling hazardous chemicals by using trained manpower,” the advisory said.“The SPCBs will closely monitor any violation of environmental norms, ensure the safety of workers and residents in the vicinity and that units comply with all conditions stipulated in the Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemical (Amendment) Rules, 1989, and the Chemical Accidents (Emergency Planning, Preparedness, and Response) Rules, 1996 without fail,” it added.“Three industrial accidents occurred on Thursday, coincidentally, when factories are reopening after relaxations from Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. One commonality among these incidents has been poor operational and maintenance practices during the lockdown and the other is a shortage of skilled staff for maintenance work. Maintaining power stations or any industries with less staff is always a risk. Such incidents in this scenario are not surprising,” industry experts said.“The toll of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions has not only pulled the economy down, but has also put lives at risk for industrial workers and townships,” said Nivit Kumar Yadav of Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment’s (CSE) industrial pollution unit.“Styrene gas must be kept at a temperature below 17 degrees Celsius. However, since the Vishakhapatnam plant was under a partial shutdown mode, its maintenance activities were irregular. Another industrial disaster was reported at a paper mill in Raigarh, Chhattisgarh, when gas leaks affected the unit’s housekeeping staff. The third incident occurred at Neyveli thermal power station, when two boilers of a 210-megawatt (MW) capacity plant blasted, and 10 people sustained injuries. While these boiler units were in a running condition, poor maintenance practices due to less manpower in the plant are being suspected as the reason for the blast. Industries are in haste to restart their operations after the lockdown restrictions are lifted, which could be detrimental to workers’ safety and that of the neighbourhood. We recommend better operational guidelines for industrial plants as they get set to resume their operations,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-safety-audits-and-prevent-chemical-leakages-before-resuming-ops-cpcb-advisory-to-states/story-NqiDV3O2zJCA0vCkECXQkM.html

A flight from Singapore with over 250 passengers and five more evacuation flights will land on Friday, she said. Flights from Abu Dhabi to Kochi and Dubai to Kozhikode with 354 passengers have reached on Thursday, she said. An Inter Ministerial Coordination Committee comprising officials from the ministries of Health, External Affairs, Home Affairs and Civil Aviation, and Armed Forces and Air India has been constituted to implement the standard operating procedure (SOP) for evacuation of stranded people to and from India, she said. The committee will coordinate with state governments, she said. “All stranded Indians can get registered at respective missions.... The travellers will be screened before boarding and only asymptomatic travellers will be allowed,” she said. She said pregnant women, students, those with their visa expiring soon, and people facing medical emergencies will be given preference on these flights. Before embarking on a flight, they will have to give an undertaking that they will be in compulsory institutional quarantine for 14 days on their own expense, she said. The evacuees will have to register on Arogya Setu app and will undergo compulsory medical testing for Covid-19 upon arrival, she said. If found positive for Covid-19, they will be taken to medical quarantine while the rest will undergo compulsory institutional quarantine for 14 days, she said. A Covid-19 test will again be conducted after completion of 14 days institutional quarantine period, and the results will help decide further course of action as per medical protocol, she said. The arrangements for institutional quarantines will be made by respective states and union territories and they will be provided with a list of arriving passengers by the Ministry of External Affairs, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-ferried-over-2-5-lakh-people-stranded-during-lockdown-in-222-special-trains-mha/story-r7f34ZSZWOIrOi5Dc8myUK.html

The state government had earlier received flak for not testing enough.Despite an increase, it is lagging behind Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, among others, in testing. While Bengal has conducted 32,572 tests till May 7, all these states had crossed the 30,000-mark by the third week of April.“We have increased the number of tests conducted per day more than 10 times since April first week. While on April 6 we had tested only 186 samples, on May 7 we tested 2611 samples,” said a senior official of the state health department.While the opposition parties and various doctors’ platforms had been criticising the state for low tests, the union home ministry sent a letter to the state’s chief secretary saying that Bengal’s response to Covid-19 has been characterised by a very low rate of testing in proportion to the population and a very high rate of mortality of 13.2%, which is the highest for any state.“The number of tests per million is now around 300. Even 10 days ago it was around 188 per million. We are lagging in tests (per million) because of various reasons. Initially, we didn’t have enough laboratories. Later, kits were found to be faulty, the matter had to be taken up with the ICMR,” said a top official of the state health department.Allegations had also surfaced that the state was not sending enough kits to the ICMR-NICED, which is a regional level Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) under the union health ministry. “While we started with only one testing facility in March, the state now has 17 testing facilities, including five private laboratories. In many districts, where the disease has a low prevalence rate, pool sampling is being done to cover as many people. We had also started rapid antibody tests but it had to be stopped after kits were found to be faulty by the ICMR,” said another health department official.With more tests being done every day the number of Covid-19 patients in the state has almost doubled in the last one week. While the number of infected patients on May 1 was 795, it has shot up to 1,548 till May 7.

08-05-2020||India||Ash immersion in Haridwar begins after govt’s nod to rituals for the dead||After over a month-long hiatus, ash immersion rituals have resumed at Haridwar from Friday onwards.People were seen carrying urns of ashes from the wee hours on Friday to the sanctum sanctorum of Brahma Kund at Har-Ki-Pauri Ganga Ghat. Local priests, too, resumed work and conducted the ash-immersion rituals.According to priests, normally in Haridwar, about 2000 to 5000 people arrive daily for ash-immersion rituals, post-cremation rituals and ‘Pitra Karmakand’ (forefather’s soul-related rites) which had been disrupted due to the nationwide lockdown affecting their livelihood.Har-Ki-Pauri is considered to be an ancient place with religious significance. It is believed that nectar of the gods had fallen here after a tug-of-war between deities and demons, as per Hindu mythology.Haridwar district administration, however, has specified that only two persons and a driver are allowed to accompany an urn to be immersed at Har-Ki-Pauri Ganga Ghat.Cabinet spokesperson Madan Kaushik said that adherence to the guidelines issued by the local administration and health department regarding Covid-19 preventive measures like wearing of face masks, social distancing and time-bound return to their respective home destinations was a must for carrying out the rituals.Terming the decision as a step in the right direction, office bearers of Ganga Sabha, the main managing body of Har-Ki-Pauri Ganga Ghat, said ash immersion should have been allowed a fortnight ago.“Ash immersion rituals are part of ancient tradition and customs which help in providing salvation (moksha) to the departed soul. It’s quite sad that after funeral rites people had to keep urns of the deceased for quite some time, but now the government has taken the right decision to allow it again,” said Pradeep Jha, president Ganga Sabha.Haridwar priests, who had last week submitted a memorandum to the state government demanding the lifting of the prohibition at Har-Ki-Pauri, were quite busy as people with urns turned up at the Ghats from Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi-NCR region, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and even beyond.Akhil Bharatiya Yuva Teerth Purohit president Ujjwal Pundit said the lockdown has severely affected their livelihood as they primarily depend on last rites related rituals and special prayers for the deceased.There are nearly 2000 priests in Haridwar involved in ash immersion rituals for several generations.Meanwhile, the ashram and dharamshala owners have demanded the opening of some eateries and tea stalls at Har-Ki-Pauri for people coming from other states.“We have been waiting for more than a week to get the permission, finally Uttarakhand government has granted the same. We have been traveling for the past seven hours. We have reached Haridwar and it is overwhelming that finally, we will be able to immerse the ashes in the Ganga,” said Vijay Singh from Haryana.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ash-immersion-in-haridwar-begins-on-uttarakhand-s-nod-to-rituals-for-the-dead/story-2J5MgkO0d5FDdbC24dJ32L.html

In his plea, he said, churches can be opened with 25% occupancy and he contended that the long lockdown is leaving a spiritual vacuum among devotees.The petitioner Saju Joseph pleaded that since most norms were eased in the state, regulated visits of devotees to churches could be allowed. Hearing the plea, the court observed that the state was yet to come out of the pandemic threat and many churches are providing virtual offerings these days. Justice Shaji P Chaly who was heading the division bench said no devotee was affected by the closure as he could access visuals of ceremonies online.But the counsel for the petitioner contended that devotees can’t receive ‘holy communion’ due to the closure of churches. Continued closure of religious places of worship is leaving a spiritual vacuum among believers and they can be opened after adhering to social distancing norms. He also suggested that each church can carry 25% of its occupancy to suit this.But both, the Union and state governments, opposed the plea vehemently saying no relaxation can be made at this juncture. They said any concessions to a particular sect will open a floodgate and weaken the strict lockdown norms. Big religious gatherings, private parties, wedding ceremonies, political meetings and receptions can’t be allowed now, they said. The court later adjourned the hearing till May 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-kerala-hc-to-open-churches-with-25-occupancy-amid-lockdown/story-WZJ2XdCyvJav6ZUT3hXhQN.html

After walking for about 36 kilometres, these workers started feeling tired and sat on the track between Karnad and Badnapur railway stations for taking some rest. They gradually went into deep sleep.It was at 5.22 am that the approaching goods train ran over these labourers, the railways ministry said in a statement. The driver tried to stop the train but couldn’t do so in time, it added.An inquiry has been ordered into the incident by the railway authorities.The railway safety watchdog has written to the ministry saying that the labourers who were crushed by the goods train were lying on the railway tracks as they were under the impression that no trains have been plying since the lockdown.“Apparently, the affected persons had gathered along the track under the impression that the train services have been suspended due to Covid-19 lockdown. Furthermore, false sense of security may have come to their minds about there being no trains on run whereas freight, parcel specials have been running from before and now migrant specials have also started plying,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/human-rights-commission-sends-notice-to-maharashtra-after-16-migrants-killed-in-train-accident/story-wEgy5OcQD7EtZvFlId561N.html

Guntur district ranks second with 374 cases and eight deaths, followed by Krishna with 322 cases and 11 deaths. Anantapur district has recorded 99 cases and four deaths.

08-05-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi offers Centre 8 point remedy for Covid-battered economy||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has recommended implementation of an eight-point formula to revive the Indian economy and reduce the financial stress caused by the coronavirus outbreak in the country.The Congress on Friday released the recommendations in a statement attributed to the former party president and Wayanad MP a few hours after he expressed his opinions on the government’s Covid-19 containment efforts in a digitised live chat session.Gandhi’s statement questions why the Centre had not announced a second fiscal relief package for individuals and businesses like other prominent economies in the west. “In India, the government has been dragging its feet on announcing an economic package targeting vulnerable groups like farmers, migrant labourers and daily wage earners as well as industry clusters like travel and tourism, automobiles, retail, etc. that have been severely damaged,” the statement says.The longer the government “delays” announcing this package the more “the pain” will grow, it adds.The statement then goes on to offer the contours of an economic stimulus package that has emerged during an internal consultative process in the Congress party.Here is a summation of the main recommendations listed in Gandhi’s statement.1. Income Support- Extend income support to at least 13 crore poorest households. Transfer Rs 7,500 preferably to each household. Even if only Rs 5,000 is transferred to each of the 13 crore poorest households, then it will only amount to Rs 65,000 crore, which we can and must afford.2. MGNREGA- 100 days of guaranteed employment under the scheme should be doubled to 200 days. Close to 28-30% of our population now resides in urban areas where a programme like MGNREGA should be introduced.3. Food Security- Ensure food security for even 11 crore people outside the PDS. Please ensure delivery of 10 kg food grains (rice or wheat) 1 kg pulses and 1 kg sugar to every individual for a period of next six months.4. Agriculture and Farmers – Empower and support the ‘Anndata’ farmer by transferring Rs 10,000 as urgent economic support to each of the 8.22 crore PM KISAN Yojana accounts. Purchase every ounce of food grains at MSP and remove GST on fertilizers, pesticides and agriculture equipment immediately.5. MSMEs- 6.25 crore MSMEs generate over 11 crore jobs. Give 1 lakh crore ‘Wage Protection Scheme’ and 1 lakh crore ‘Credit Guarantee Scheme’ to MSMEs. Give six months interest subsidy as equal to six months of interest on loan taken by SMEs.6. Large Industries – Similar credit guarantee and interest subsidy facilities must be extended to big businesses as well. This will ensure that the value chain survives and no layoffs happen.7. Shopkeepers- Except for hotspots, retail supply chains should be restored to bring relief to around 7 crore shopkeepers.8. Migrant labour – I am deeply disturbed and saddened by trains being cancelled and migrants being forced to stay back in some states. They are not bonded labour and should be allowed to return home according to their own free will.

The duo sprayed petrol on the victim and burned him when he was sleeping around 3am on Thursday.The deceased has been identified as 40-year-old Shyam Sundar Kumhar. According to police officials, the incident was reported from Chak 6 PHM village falling under Khajuwala police station area. “Around 7pm, Kumhar, who is a mechanic, returned from the workshop where he worked. He had his dinner and was using mobile phone till 1am. Around 3am in the morning, his daughter, identified as Priyanka (19) along with her mother Pushpa (38), went inside Kumhar’s thatch where he was sleeping on bed. Priyanka was carrying a jug with petrol which she sprinkled on her father’s mouth and bed and Pushpa lit a torch made by tying a cloth on the branch of a neem tree and put it on her husband’s mouth and fled the spot,” said Vikram Singh, station house officer (SHO), Khajuwala police station.The fire later spread across the thatch and Kumhar was burnt alive. The neighbours informed the police about the incident after which a team of police and officials of the forensic science laboratory reached the spot for inspection.The mother-daughter duo, hiding in an old army bunker located 10 kilometres away from the village, was caught on the basis of the footprints made in the sand dunes from the incident site to the bunker.“Kumhar was a mechanic which is why he used to keep petrol in his home and her wife was aware of this. Both of them have been detained. The daughter said that her age is 19 but that is yet to be confirmed,” the Khajuwala SHO added.The neighbours told police that Kumhar got married to Pushpa Devi, resident of Goluwala village, 20 years ago but the couple used to have frequent fights. Because of the fights, the deceased man had built a separate house for the family to live.Apart from Priyanka, the couple have two more children – one son, identified as Daya Shankar who studies in a private school in Sikar and another daughter, 10-year-old Sapna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/40-yr-old-man-burnt-to-death-by-wife-daughter-in-rajasthan-bikaner/story-pUe2dW1DxVmaVAe3xbH82H.html

The judge said he will have to be treated at a government hospital.Acting on Bhatt’s plea, Justice Dangre had on May 6 directed a public prosecutor to “make a statement about the situation in connection with Covid-19 prevailing in Arthur Road jail”.His plea filed through advocate Kiran Padalkar, stated that “the applicant is aged 66 years and a chronic heart patient who has undergone by-pass surgery and diagnosed with coronary artery disease and also suffering from hypertension.”Bhatt had sought interim bail in view of the Supreme Court’s directive to states and union territories to decongest prisons in view of the coronavirus pandemic.CBI counsel Hiten Venegaonkar had, however, opposed the plea stating that pursuant to the directives of the apex court, a High Power Committee constituted by the state government has decided to grant temporary bail only to the prisoners charged with offences punishable with not more than 7 years imprisonment and Bhatt’s case was not covered under the apex court directives.Justice Dangre, had however, noted the apprehension expressed by the accused because of his peculiar health condition and the health crisis being faced by the world, and directed the public prosecutor to make the statement on Friday.Additional public prosecutor Shahaji Shinde, accordingly on Friday, informed the court that a number of inmates and some staff members of the Arthur Road jail have been found to be infected with coronavirus and Bhatt was among those inmates.In a massive fraud allegedly perpetuated by fugitive jeweller Nirav Modi and his maternal uncle Mehul Choksi, CBI has also booked Bhatt and others under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. They are also booked by the enforcement directorate under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.According to information given by the Maharashtra home department, 77 inmates and 26 staff members of the Arthur Road jail have tested positive for the coronavirus infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pnb-bank-fraud-accused-hemant-bhatt-tests-covid-19-positive-hc-rejects-temporary-bail-plea/story-iJmmzw0cmkLyqunCi1UzhP.html

The railway safety watchdog, who is appointed under the civil aviation ministry, has written a letter, a copy of which has been reviewed by Hindustan Times, saying that the labourers who were crushed by the goods train were lying on the railway tracks as they were under the impression that no trains have been plying since the lockdown. “Apparently, the affected persons had gathered along the track under the impression that the train services have been suspended due to Covid-19 lockdown. Furthermore, false sense of security may have come to their minds about there being no trains on run whereas freight, parcel specials have been running from before and now migrant specials have also started plying,” he wrote. At least 16 migrant labourers were crushed to death in the early hours of Friday morning by a goods train in Maharashtra after they fell asleep on the tracks. An inquiry has been ordered by the railway safety commissioner. “It is with a heavy heart that I solicit your kind attention to the unfortunate incident of around 14-16 persons run over by a goods train…as discussed with you, statutory inquiry by CRS has been ordered into this incident,” he wrote. “Now that such an incident of migrants or other persons walking along the track leading to consequent deaths have come to notice, all our efforts must be made to prevent recurrence of such incidents in the future,” he added. The safety commissioner said, as an abundant precaution, it is essential that all railway personnel connected with train operations, maintenance, and patrolling activities should be cautioned to immediately communicate any occurrence of persons walking along the track, “if noticed by them, to the nearest station so that necessary action like caution order to all passing trains…may be taken.” The safety commissioner has instructed that a ‘caution order’ will have to be given to ensure special precautions. “In consequence of the line being under repair or for any other reason, special precautions are necessary, a Caution Order detailing the kilometres between which such precautions are necessary, the reasons for taking such precautions, and the speed at which a train shall travel, shall be handed to the Loco Pilot at the stopping station immediately short of the place where such precautions are necessary, or at such other stations and in such manner, as prescribed under special instructions,” the letter said. The loco pilot driving the freight train that was involved in the incident of running over labourers in Aurangabad district, Maharashtra, had tried to warn them by honking upon spotting them and also tried to stop the train, the railway ministry said Friday. “The Controller or the Centralised Traffic control Operator, on becoming aware of such defect or failure, shall inform the same to the railway servant responsible for the maintenance of the equipment and other railway servants concerned,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrants-thought-trains-not-plying-railway-safety-watchdog-after-16-killed/story-aNOeQXjljXE12xucIbNDNK.html
08-05-2020||India||Trucks carrying essential goods during lockdown being used to traffick drugs: NCB||The free inter-state movement of trucks and other essential goods carrying vehicles during the lockdown period is being misused by criminals to traffick drugs in the country, the NCB said on Friday after it busted some rackets.The federal agency, over the last two weeks, seized 60 kg of opium, a total of 61,638 psychotropic tablets, 840 bottles of codeine based cough syrup and 574 kgs of ‘ganja’ (cannabis) after conducting operations across the country. “It is worrying to note that drug traffickers are using the free inter-state movement of essential commodity vehicles during the lockdown period to aid the trafficking efforts,” Narcotics Control Bureau’s Deputy Director (operations) K P S Malhotra said. The agency has increased vigil across all state borders in view of these new developments, he added. The country is in the third phase of the lockdown, that began on March 25, to cut the chain of coronavirus infection. The sleuths of the anti-narcotics agency intercepted a Maharashtra registered truck on the intervening night of May 4-5 in Kodapura area of Surat (Gujarat) and recovered 574 kgs of cannabis that was allegedly concealed under a load of potatoes. “The consignment had its origin in Odisha and was sourced to Surat. The trafficking network is spread across the states of Gujarat, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra,” Malhotra said. In a similar seizure, an NCB team seized 60 kgs of opium from a Haryana registered truck from the Fatehpur district of Uttar Pradesh on April 28. The narcotics was recovered from “under the driver’s seat,” the officer said. Initial investigation reveals that the opium was sourced from near Chouparan in Jharkhand and was destined to Haryana, another senior official of the agency said. B Singh, the driver and the owner of the truck, has been arrested.   It is uncommon for opium to be sourced from Jharkhand and all efforts are being made to trace the source of the seized drug, he added.   In an another case, the agency seized  61,368 psychotropic tablets and 840 bottles of codeine based cough syrup from the Patan district of Gujarat on April 26. A person, J Kumar Patel, was arrested by the agency under the provision of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS). These drugs cannot be sold by any medical store without a valid medical prescription from a registered medical practitioner, Malhotra said. Such drugs, he added, usually reach the illegal market by way of diversion from illicit drug manufacturers, wholesalers or retail chemists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trucks-carrying-essential-goods-during-lockdown-being-used-to-traffick-drugs-ncb/story-axQyQYN2DtLO216b98MBKJ.html
08-05-2020||India||Kerala HC seeks govt response on plea against Aarogya Setu||The Kerala high court on Friday sought the response of the central government to a plea challenging its May 1 directive to make the mobile application, Aarogya Setu, mandatory for all persons working in government and private companies.The bench headed by justice Shaji P Chaly, however, did not stay the government directive but asked authorities to file a response by May 12. The petitioner, John Daniel, who is the general secretary of the Thrissur district Congress committee, challenged the government’s order, alleging that it violates the privacy and autonomy of an individual. He submitted that Aarogya setu collects personal information without the consent of an individual. He also pointed out that the Centre’s directive asked states to act under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against anyone who does not install the app. Section 188 states that any person who disobeys an order given by a public servant can be punished with imprisonment of up to six months.“If a particular citizen disapproves the use of the same, it could be said that the information was forcibly and coercively taken from him without his consent and by inflicting fear of penal consequences. Such coercive and forcible extraction of personal information from an individual is unheard of in a democratic and republic setup and it is attribute of a dictatorial system,” the petition stated.The central government launched Aarogya Setu on April 2 to disseminate information regarding Covid-19 and to collect data from individuals. It uses a smartphone’s GPS and bluetooth features to track people with coronavirus infection. It uses bluetooth to determine whether or not an individual has been within six feet of a Covid-19 patient by scanning through the database of cases across India.On April 29, the app was made mandatory for all central government employees. On May 1, it was extended to all employees employed in private and public institutions.The petitioner’s argument was that the app is a tracking a mobile application which continuously collects data of an individual once installed on a mobile phone. By forcing people to download the app, there is no question of consent in providing personal information, the petitioner claimed.Autonomy of an individual is central to the right to life as per the 2017 judgment of the Supreme Court in KS Puttaswamy, the petitioner submitted.“There arises no question of consent in the providing of information which has been made compulsory. Hence, when a citizen of the Nation downloads and uses the application, complying with the directives [of the central government], there is absolutely no consent obtained from him,” the petition stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-seeks-govt-response-on-plea-against-aarogya-setu/story-u02vN6ny0EMsqtjIKvKhgM.html

Under this, ICMR will conduct the trial in 21 hospitals, to assess safety & efficacy of convalescent plasma,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry.Agarwal said five of these hospitals were in Maharashtra, four in Gujarat, two each in Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, and one each in Punjab, Karnataka, Telangana and Chandigarh.Convalescent plasma therapy involves taking antibodies from cured Covid-19 patients and injecting them in the blood of sick patients suffering from coronavirus. The transfusion of plasma is carried out through a machine which separates the plasma from the blood which is then retransferred into the donor. The plasmas thus obtained is injected into a sick coronavirus patient. A donor supplies 300-500 ml of plasma and the transfusion process takes between 60-90 minutes.An antibody is a passive vaccine which assists in bringing down the viral load thus controlling the infection.The Union health ministry had advised against considering plasma therapy to be an approved treatment for coronavirus and added it should only be used for research and trial purposes to check its efficacy. If used indiscriminately, the therapy could lead to life-threatening complications.Experts have opined that large scale use of Plasma therapy is limited by the availability of the volume of plasma and the challenge of its careful screening for the presence of other infections that if unwittingly transferred to the recipient, can lead to complications.Two coronavirus patients were given convalescent plasma therapy at the SMS hospital in Jaipur a couple of days ago and doctors said they showed improvement. They also said that it was important to understand at what stage a patient requires plasma therapy.In Mumbai, however, Maharashtra’s first novel coronavirus patient to undergo the clinical trial for plasma therapy died last month.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/21-hospitals-across-india-cleared-for-stage-2-of-plasma-therapy-most-in-worst-hit-maharashtra/story-OXEPRbyLnn7cjomcb0CrtL.html

08-05-2020||India||‘Stay where you are’: Shivraj Chouhan appeals to migrants after train tragedy||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Friday appealed to stranded migrant workers to stay wherever they are. Chouhan’s comments came hours after 16 migrants who were sleeping on railway tracks were run over by a train in Maharashtra’s Aurangabad.“I will like to make an appeal to all the labourers stranded in other states to stay where they are. The state government is making all arrangements to bring them back. The process is going on in full swing and we will accomplish the mission with support of railways. About 80,000 labourers have been brought back,” said Chouhan.Having walked several kilometres, the labourers sat down for rest on the tracks and then fell asleep. Soon after a goods train ran over them. The accident took place between Jalna and Aurangabad in the Nanded Division of South Central Railway. The Railways have ordered an inquiry into the incident after CM Chouhan dialled minister Piyush Goyal seeking a probe. The labourers who were killed in the accident belonged to Shahdol and Umaria districts in Madhya Pradesh, said police. The authorities are trying to verify the identity of each and every labourer, said Superintendent of police, Shahdol, Satyendra Shukla.Twelve among those who were identified are: Achchhelal Kachhi, Ajit Jeevan Singh, Brijgendra Singh, Muneem Singh and Nemshah Singh, all residents of Umaria district; Suresh Kol, Dharmendra Singh, Brajesh Gond, Rajbaba Horan Singh, Brajesh Singh and Shivdayal Gajraj Singh from Shahdol district; and Indrakumar Mauryaveer, a resident of Katni district in Madhya Pradesh.A police officer said the labourers worked in a steel plant in Jalna district. They left Jalna at 7 pm on Thursday and walked on the road to Badnapore. Later they started walking along the railway tracks, he added. “As they got tired having walked about 36 kilometres, they sat on the railway track to have some rest. Later, they fell asleep on the tracks when the train ran over them,” said the officer.CM Chouhan has announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 5 lakh each to next to the kin of the deceased. “A team of high ranking officials from Madhya will fly to Aurangabad in a special plane. The team will make all arrangements for last rites of the labourers and treatment of the injured,” said Chouhan.Congress leader Digvijaya Singh sought answers from the state government over the tragedy.“Did the Madhya Pradesh government have the labourers registered? If registration was done, what were arrangements made by the state government to bring them back? The government should feel ashamed. Instead of issuing statements, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan should do something for the labourers,” said Singh.(With input from Monika Pandey in Jabalpur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stay-where-you-are-shivraj-chouhan-appeals-to-migrants-after-train-tragedy/story-81XzUROI3DWY6hIB59it4N.html
08-05-2020||India||In the back-end of the Covid-19 fight, big data works silently||“We are now at the bottom of the peak,” says Dr Deepak Agrawal, professor of neurosciences at New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). What he means is that the Covid-19 pandemic in India hasn’t reached a stage in which the number of cases multiplies exponentially. And India, he said, shouldn’t reach a crisis point like the US did, when the fight against Covid-19 was hindered by a critical shortage of ventilators that meant doctors had to decide who among a myriad patients needed to be put on one.Agrawal is the co-inventor, along with robotics engineer Divakar Vaish, of the world’s smallest full intensive care unit portable ventilator. It runs on an Android platform and is already in use at ICUs in AIIMS, the country’s most reputed public hospital.The device, with 600 installations, is proving handy in the fight against Covid-19. To be sure, the share of Covid-19 patients needing a ventilator right now remains small in India, Agrawal said.Behind the scenes, India’s fight against the coronavirus is a high-tech battle, thanks to the country’s vanguard software services industry. Federal authorities are reaping its fullest potential in fighting a pandemic that has infected 56,342 people so far.Technology developers are working at breakneck speed for solutions, making officials at the state-run policy think-tank, Niti Aayog, picky.The story starts with low-cost ventilators and goes all the way to artificial intelligence (AI) applications and drone-monitored social distancing, a review by the interministerial empowered group no. 6 (EG 6) shows. EG 6, one of the several federal panels formed to contain the spread of Covid-19, is headed by Niti Aayog’s CEO Amitabh Kant and responsible for leveraging technologies against Covid-19.A dystopian scenarioFor arriving employees at Fastrek, a courier company in Hyderabad, the first point of reporting isn’t the supervisor, but an automated thermal scanner. It’s a dystopic scene. Masked employees stand face-to-face before a robot that records temperatures. Such screening is essential to catching the coronavirus infection early.Similarly, Gurugram-based Staqu Technologies has installed AI-enabled thermal imaging cameras for screening essential services workers in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Staqu Technologies’s built-in thermal device can measure body temperature from a distance of up to 10 metres and prints workers’ entry passes.Asimov Robotics’s “Karmi-bot” is trialling medicine dispensing duties at isolation wards in hospitals. It can even conduct video calls with caregivers. “These are just a few of the innovators who are taking the fight to the pandemic,” said Kant.In India’s Covid-19 fightback, big-data analysts sit silently at the back end. “Data and technology are the biggest warriors in the fight against Covid-19. And one of the things they can do is recommend the extent of lockdown on a hyperlocal level in a granular manner. Such a level of complex decision making is impossible to make without the use of data,” says Ashwin Srivastava, the CEO of Sapio, an AI solutions firm.The authorities have carved up the country’s districts into hotspots, non-hotspots, red, orange and green zones, depending on their vulnerability and Covid-19 case counts.Sapio Umbrella’s lockdown platform, which uses big data technology, claims to provide an optimum plan for lockdowns, down to the village level that can be extrapolated to larger areas.Privacy concernsThe government’s Aarogya Setu, a contact tracing app, reached 80 million downloads in just over 13 days, making it the world’s fastest downloaded app, according to Kant.Smartphone tools have become popular globally for tracking people for Covid-19. As surveillance goes viral in India, like elsewhere, it has set off demand for privacy preserving solutions.“Everything is presented as though it is an inevitable trade-off,” said Prasanna S, a lawyer who has voiced concern over privacy violations in the fight against Covid. “If the government asks us to part of with our privacy, then there needs to be rigour and hard empirical basis. For instance, there should be evidence to say that a specific application is going to be safe and has a 50% chance of flattening the curve,” he said.In the absence of a vaccine, Gupta says, the right technology is critical to fight the worst pandemic in a century. Federal officials are gung-ho about the support they have received from technology developers, who see future business potential.“If the results are so encouraging in the health sector, then with adequate support and a robust regulatory framework, this can be replicated across most sectors, helping India become self-sufficient and the nerve centre for growth and capability,” says Kant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-the-back-end-of-the-covid-fight-big-data-works-silently/story-PzzI8szh3T5ztIMW9JoDoJ.html

He also tried to stop the train after spotting the men, the ministry further said.At least 16 migrant labourers were crushed to death in the wee hours of Friday morning by a goods train in Maharashtra after they fell asleep on the tracks.“The incident occurred, even as the loco pilot of the goods train honked the horn as soon as he noticed the group of people infringing the rail tracks and also made all possible efforts to stop the train, the ministry said. Also read: ‘Extremely anguished’: PM Modi on Maharashtra train accident that killed 16 migrantsIncidentally, the average speed of goods trains which is normally around 24 km per hour, has also more than doubled during the lockdown period as the suspension of passenger trains has decongested the rail network. A high-level inquiry headed by the Commissioner of Railway Safety (South Central Circle) has been ordered to investigate the incident and find out the cause. “The Commissioner of Railway Safety will hold an independent inquiry in today’s labourers runover incident in Parbhani-Manmad section of Nanded Railway division of South Central Railway,” the ministry said. Union Railways minister Piyush Goyal is closely monitoring the situation and it is being briefing on the steps taken in this regard, it added.According to railways, the workers left Jalna at 7 pm on Thursday and initially walked on road and later onto the track towards Aurangabad. After walking for about 36 kilometres, these workers started feeling tired and sat on the track between Karnad and Badnapur railway stations for taking some rest and gradually went into deep sleep.Also read: Railway Ministry orders inquiry into Aurangabad train accident“In an unfortunate event that occurred in the wee hours of May 8, morning, around 5:22 hrs, a group of persons who were sleeping on railway tracks, were hit by a goods train proceeding towards Mandmad. The incident occurred between Badnapur and Karmad stations on the Parbhani-Manmad section of Nanded Division,” it added. Five others who were injured were taken to the Aurangabad Civil Hospital, railways said. The accident happened between Jalna and Aurangabad in the Nanded Division of South Central Railway in Karmad police station area of the Aurangabad district.“Out of the group comprising of about 19 persons, 14 succumbed to death on the spot and 2 have succumbed to the injuries subsequently. One person with minor injuries is being treated at the Aurangabad Civil Hospital,” the ministry said. Maharashtra Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) on Friday announced an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh each to the families of those who were killed in the Aurangabad train accident.According to a senior official, the railways does not consider accidents that happen due to external factors as ‘railway accidents’ and hence is not bound to provide ex-gratia relief to the victim’s families. “It is provided only in accidents where the railway is involved such as derailment of trains etc. In this case, states and the Centre are likely to provide the relief,” the official said.Also read: Madhya Pradesh CM announces Rs 5 lakh aid for kin of labourers killed in Maharashtra“Extremely anguished by the loss of lives due to the rail accident in Aurangabad, Maharashtra.

Opposition parties alleged the Centre’s transport policy of providing buses and trains to transport migrant workers during the Covid-19 lockdown was poorly designed. “It is obvious that the transport policy of providing buses and trains to transport migrant workers was poorly designed, planned, coordinated and implemented. Once the policy was announced, government should have gone to the rescue of the trekkers and provided buses or trains to them to continue their journey. The tragedy that happened this morning could have been avoided if governments had gone to the rescue of the migrant workers in time,” Congress Rajya Sabha MP P Chidambaram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aurangabad-train-accident-loco-pilot-blew-horn-to-warn-labourers-says-ministry/story-6w346N8zEfF9U7lElypx0I.html

Doesnt @PiyushGoyal have a train to run them over with?#ShameOnBJP https://t.co/QCjgp8yy9AThe abuse against Sharma led to widespread outrage on social media. The Twitter user reportedly resorted to an abusive comment while suggesting means to Sharma for protecting the migrants from running over. “I have already made an online complaint to Mumbai police but have not yet got any reply from them. I am also sending a written complaint and mail to Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, home minister Anil Deshmukh and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray with details about the person,” Sharma said.“I have gathered some information about the person who tweeted about me, his name is Shashank Singh and he is from Kolkata but I am not sure.

08-05-2020||India||RSS labour wing criticises move to amend labour laws amid Covid-19 outbreak||The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), the labour wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has criticised the move by the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Uttar Pradesh (UP) governments to amend their labour laws, alleging that the hurriedly made decisions would strip workers of job security amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak across the country.In a bid to woo investors to their respective states and make a desperate bid to emerge as an alternative manufacturing hub to China amid the Covid-19 crisis, both MP and UP announced a raft of changes to their labour laws this week.While MP has allowed longer working hours and a 1,000-day labour law holiday for new investors, UP has also brought in Uttar Pradesh Temporary Exemption from Certain Labour Laws Ordinance, 2020, exempting companies from complying with several labour norms for the next three years.The BMS, which claims the affiliation of over 6,000 labour unions, said it would urge the Centre to prevail upon the state governments to roll back their ‘labour-unfriendly’ decisions.“This is the worst time to make amendments to the labour laws. These changes will make the workers more vulnerable to job losses, especially at a time when the country should be joining hands to rebuild their lives and the economy hit by the Covid-19 pandemic,” said CK Saji Narayana, president, BMS.He said the heart-wrenching reports of stranded migrant labourers across states, who have been forced to sleep on railway tracks and walk back for hundreds of kilometres to their native places due to the nationwide lockdown restrictions, are growing evidence of “workers being treated badly by both their employers and the government”.The BMS chief demanded a universal safety law for workers. “There is a need to reinforce safety provisions and more so after the Visakhapatnam gas plant tragedy on Thursday. For instance, MP’s amended law has done away with the need of even installing a fire extinguisher if an industrial unit employs less than 50 people,” he said.Earlier, HT had reported that various state governments are amending labour laws to attract new investments. In April, the BJP has submitted a report to the Union government, recommending revisiting the labour and land acquisition laws in a bid to woo investors.A BJP functionary from UP said the state is in talks with several companies, who are considering moving their production base from China to India. He, however, refused to divulge the names of companies with whom talks have been initiated.“It’s important to pitch India as an investment destination because it guarantees investment, jobs and allows rebuilding the economy,” the functionary said, adding that the workers’ rights and interests would be safeguarded and not “compromised”.Narayanan, however, disagreed with such claims. He cited that India couldn’t overnight dispense with its laws amid a rush to emerge as an alternative to China as a manufacturing hub.“This rush to become an investment destination is akin to a viral outbreak. The rule of law is fundamental to a civilised society. We cannot allow jungle raj, and turn the labour sector into a veritable conflict zone,” he warned.He debunked the BJP’s report to the Centre pitching for labour law reforms on the grounds that they impede investments and escalate costs. “India cannot do away with labour protection norms just because it wants to compete with China,” Narayan said.Earlier this week, Prof Biswajit Dhar of the Jawahar Lal Nehru University had told HT that changing labour laws amid the pandemic would not solve the government’s problems.He suggested that the government must focus on moving forward by adopting an employment policy that creates more jobs and better social security for workers.On Thursday, MP chief minister Shivaraj Singh Chouhan defended the state government’s decision to amend its labour laws. “Industrial reforms were long-awaited. We plan to increase job opportunities for the people by wooing investors to the state. MP is blessed with ample resources such as water, land, forests and skilled youth power. This is the right time to amend the rules as per new requirements and to simplify them to attract industries that are willing to shift from other places,” he said.Amended labour laws would facilitate the establishment of new industries, create new job opportunities and workers’ interests would also be safeguarded, he added.In UP, Siddharth Nath Singh, cabinet minister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME), investment and export promotion, khadi and village industries said on Thursday after holding a meeting with Satoshi Suzuki, ambassador of Japan to India, that the state is geared up to attract and receive Japanese investments moving out of China and made a pointed reference to the new labour reforms.The Japanese representatives have appreciated the Uttar Pradesh Temporary Exemption from Certain Labour Laws Ordinance, 2020, said a person, who was privy to the discussions in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-labour-wing-criticises-move-to-amend-labour-laws-amid-covid-19-outbreak/story-YFm87opPyyZ4JpEpz8QGSM.html
08-05-2020||India||‘Dispel fear among people about Covid-19’: Rahul Gandhi to PM Modi||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to dispel the fear among people about the coronavirus disease, decentralise by making the states partners in decision-making and immediately put money in the people’s hands to enable them to tide over the crisis triggered by the pandemic.Gandhi said the mindset of the people about the coronavirus needs to be changed by reinforcing the fact that this is a dangerous disease for just 1-2% of the population who are old and those who have diabetic and heart conditions.“We need to decentralise power in dealing with the virus and take this fight to the district level. If we restrict this fight to the PMO only, we will lose. The Prime Minister must devolve power. If we centralise, there will be a calamity,” he told reporters during an hour-long news conference addressed through video-conferencing.ALSO READ | ‘Lockdown not an on-off switch’: Rahul Gandhi asks govt to spell out post-May 17 strategy“The Prime Minister has to trust chief ministers and the chief ministers in turn have to trust the district magistrates. Leave the decisions to categorise zones on the basis of the situation to them. Delhi does not have an idea about the situation on the ground,” he added.The BJP countered the Congress leader by alleging that he was “out of touch with reality” and that PM Modi is at the forefront of this grave challenge.“We don’t know which world Rahul Gandhi is living in. Fight against Coronavirus pandemic best exemplifies Team India spirit fostered by PM Narendra Modi. Views and experiences of state governments have largely contributed to the framing and revision of Central government’s guidelines. Rahul is out of touch with reality and out of sync with his own party ruled state governments,” said GVL Narsimha Rao, BJP spokesperson.This was Gandhi’s second press conference during the lockdown period. The former Congress chief had earlier addressed the media on April 16, when he insisted that the lockdown is not a solution to defeat Covid-19 but a pause button and stressed the need for having a comprehensive exit strategy in place to ensure that the coronavirus does not come back once the restrictions are lifted.This time as well, Gandhi called upon the government to specify the criteria it would use to open the lockdown or continue it post May 17.Gandhi said the need of the hour is to have a strong Indian at every level. “The Prime Minister has his own style. I am not saying that is wrong, that is his way. But in my view, in such a situation a strong Prime Minister along with a lot of strong chief ministers and a lot of strong collectors are needed,” he added.“I want us to tackle the disease at the local level itself. I want a strong Indian leader to stand in front of this disease - be it a collector or a farmer,” the former Congress chief elaborated.While asserting that this is not the time to crticise the government, he said the people should think of the country first and not think in partisan terms like one belongs to the RSS, BJP or the Congress.“Everyone has a responsibility. Everyone should forget which party they belong to, the only thing to be remembered is that we are all Indians and together we have to end the fear and the economy has to be brought back on track,” Gandhi said.He said the government needs to work on a psychological change and if it has to open lockdown, it has to convert people’s fear of the disease into confidence, as it is not deadly for 98-99% of them.Gandhi said the idea of injecting immediately a sum of Rs 7500 directly into the hands of poor is critical and demanded an immediate financial package to protect the industry which provides jobs.“We have to protect the job creators and have to build a wall for them to protect jobs and wages of workers. We have to give them financial support,” he said.He said the economic package is being delayed as the government feels India could be downgraded by international agencies.“We need to start our domestic economy soon, the more time we lose, the worse impact it will have,” added Gandhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dispel-fear-among-people-about-covid-19-rahul-gandhi-to-pm-modi/story-a5mj0sHkkF37rVUJq6fliJ.html

According to railway officials, the workers were walking towards their home state of Madhya Pradesh after losing their jobs during the lockdown imposed to check the coronavirus pandemic.In the absence of public transport that has already been stalled in keeping with the lockdown conditions, workers across states are being forced to walk. The signatories - Rajesh Tandon of PRIA Delhi, Amitabh Kundu of RIS, Dr Jagadananda of CYSD, Bhubaneshwar; Yogesh Kumar of Samarthan, Bhopal and Dr Sheela Patel of SPARC, Mumbai - have urged the central government and the states to treat the issue of migrant workers as a “national emergency”.“Fear, uncertainty, distress and inhumane treatment by local officials and police have resulted in a situation where widespread unrest and violence may occur anytime. The only option is for the central government to ask railways to ferry them home in hundreds of trains from all main economic centres, and to manage this process in an orderly manner, without harassment and stampede,” the statement issued by the groups reads.The group said it has been receiving reports from Mumbai, Pune, Surat, Ahmedabad, Delhi and several other urban centres where the lockdown has made migrant labour anxious to return home. “Our estimate based on the past census and NSS data and ground level information is that nearly 6 to 8 million of them are still stranded and a desperate to go home. Many of them are hungry and without shelter,” the statement said.Referring to reports of states forcing workers to stay back, such as in Karnataka (though the state later rolled back the decision), the group said workers cannot be subject to inhuman conditions.“We hear reports the time in business community have advise state governments to keep them within the states for restarting the economy post lock down. While giving definite offer of jobs in social security is welcome, they can be no logic to detain them against their wishes,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/treat-issue-of-migrant-workers-as-national-emergency-academicians-urge-govt/story-AnZo4tYcIG1jPBoJM9xuCL.html
08-05-2020||India||Before lifting lockdown, govt needs to bring transparency in exit plan: Rahul||Former Congress President Rahul Gandhi said on Friday that the nationwide lockdown to combat the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19) is not like an on-off switch, saying that if the government wants to end the lockdown, it must bring physiological change in the minds of the people and transperancy in exit plan.In a video conference with mediapersons, Rahul Gandhi, who is also an MP from Kerala’s Wayanad, said, “We have been having internal discussions on the suggestions to we would be giving the government.” He said the country is beginning to run into a little bit of problem. “There is a strong feeling that we need to immediately release packages to the MSMEs, give money in the hands of the poor and have a strategy for the migrants besides preparing for the opening of the lockdown,” he said. Rahul Gandhi also urged the Central government to provide little bit of “transparency” about its actions. “We need to understand that when they lift the lockdown, what would be the criteria for it, what are the boxes they want to tick before actually initiating the process. It is important that government tells the people about these criteria,” the Congress leader said. “We simply cannot continue without providing support to the people who are suffering due to the lockdown,” he added. The Congress leader further said that the lockdown is not only switching on a key, it requires a number of things to happen, it needs a psychological change.According to Rahul Gandhi, the Covid-19 disease is currently very dangerous for the elderly, and people with ailments like diabetis, cardiac problem and lung disease. “We need to bring a psychological change in the minds of the people. If the government wants to open up, it has to turn this fear into a sense of confidence. Otherwise people will start going out the moment the lockdown is lifted,” he said. “We need a stratgy to open up the lockdown. A massive transition is required... it requires coordination between the states, the Central government, district magistrates and many others. That is the challenge the government faces,” he said.This was the second interaction of the Congress leader with the media in the last one month amid the nationwide lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/before-lifting-lockdown-govt-needs-to-bring-transperancy-in-exit-plan-rahul/story-eIq4q7p0nUVM8bPdD8WJpI.html
08-05-2020||India||Migrants stranded all over world at heightened risk of Covid-19: IOM||Thousands of migrants have been stranded “all over the world” where they face a heightened risk of Covid-19 infection, the head of the UN migration agency International Organization for Migration (IOM) has said.IOM Director-General António Vitorino said that more onerous health-related travel restrictions might discriminate disproportionately against migrant workers in future.“Health is the new wealth,” Vitorino said, citing proposals by some countries to introduce the so-called immunity passports and use mobile phone apps designed to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.“In lots of countries in the world, we already have a system of screening checks to identify the health of migrants, above all malaria, tuberculosis… HIV-AIDS, and now I believe that there will be increased demands in health controls for regular migrants,” he said on Thursday.Travel restrictions to try to limit the spread of the pandemic has left people on the move more vulnerable than ever and unable to work to support themselves, Vitorino told journalists via videoconference.“There are thousands of stranded migrants all over the world.“In South-East Asia, in East Africa, in Latin America, because of the closing of the borders and with the travel restrictions, lots of migrants who were on the move; some of them wanted to return precisely because of the pandemic,” he said.They are blocked, some in large groups, some in small, in the border areas, in very difficult conditions without access to minimal care, especially health screening, Vitorino said.“We have been asking the governments to allow the humanitarian workers and the health workers to have access to (them),” he said.Turning to Venezuelan migrants, who are believed to number around five million amidst a worsening economic crisis in the country, the IOM chief said “thousands… have lost their jobs in countries like Ecuador and Colombia and are returning back to Venezuela in large crowds without any health screening and being quarantined when they go back”.In a statement, the IOM highlighted the plight of migrants left stranded in the desert in west, central and eastern Africa, either after having been deported without the due process, or abandoned by the smugglers.The IOM’s immediate priorities for migrants include ensuring that they have access to healthcare and other basic social welfare assistance in their host country.Among the UN agency’s other immediate concerns is preventing the spread of new coronavirus infection in more than 1,100 camps that it manages across the world.They include the Cox’s Bazar complex in Bangladesh, home to around one million mainly ethnic Rohingya from Myanmar, the majority having fled persecution.So far, no cases of infection have been reported there, the IOM chief said, adding that preventative measures have been communicated to the hundreds of thousands of camp residents, while medical capacity has been boosted.Beyond the immediate health threat of Covid-19 infection, migrants also face growing stigmatization from which they need protection, Vitorino said.Allowing hate speech and xenophobic narratives to thrive unchallenged also threatens to undermine the public health response to Covid-19, he said, before noting that migrant workers make up a significant percentage of the health sector in many developed countries including the UK, the US and Switzerland.Populist narratives targeting migrants as carriers of disease could also destabilise national security through social upheaval and countries’ post-Covid economic recovery by removing critical workers in agriculture and service industries, he said.Remittances have already seen a 30 per cent drop during the pandemic, Vitorino said, citing the World Bank data, meaning that some USD 20 billion has not been sent home to families in countries where up to 15 per cent of their gross domestic product comes from pay packets earned abroad.Vitorino, in a plea, urged to give the health of migrants as much attention as that of the host populations in all countries.“It is quite clear that health is the new wealth and that health concerns will be introduced in the mobility systems - not just for migration - but as a whole; where travelling for business or professional reasons, health will be the new gamechanger in town.“If the current pandemic leads to a two or even three-tier mobility system, then we will have to try to solve the problem – the problem of the pandemic - but at the same time we have created a new problem of deepening the inequalities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrants-stranded-all-over-world-at-heightened-risk-of-covid-19-iom/story-2mJ51ffZNI73DdwSELKP2H.html

The train departed at around 12 noon and was flagged off by Kunal, the Nodal Officer for coordinating the departure and entry of persons into the state as well as the North Goa Superintendent of Police Utkrisht Prasoon. “Today one train departed Goa for Gwalior having 1196 passengers having shramik special. This is our first train from Goa to Gwalior and this train is expected to reach tomorrow morning,” Kunal (he doesn’t use a surname) said. “This train is taking people from the distressed category of people who have registered with us to go online and also through the survey conducted by the department so they are belonging to eight districts of Madhya Pradesh we have already alerted the nodal officer of MP at Gwalior where they will be received and these passengers will be transported to their respective district by dedicated buses. After final screening at the boarding point eight passengers were taken out for further checks,” Kunal said. The process for the transfer of the people -- mostly labourers who were housed at various relief camps set up by the state government, began on Thursday with those selected asked to gather where they were screened for symptoms and after verification brought to the railway station in specially arranged buses and boarded on the train. More trains are scheduled to be organized over the coming days depending on the availability. More than 10,000 labourers each from UP and Bihar too are awaiting trains while those from Karnataka are being dropped back by buses arranged by the Goa government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-first-shramik-special-train-from-goa-leaves-for-gwalior/story-teiw8DfCZRIkMm2Vi88kPM.html
08-05-2020||India||Bharat Biotech eyes human monoclonal antibody therapy for Covid-19||The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has sanctioned a project led by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech to develop human monoclonal antibodies as a therapy for Covid-19 in the next six months.The project was approved under CSIR’s flagship programme, New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (NMITLI). Apart from Bharat Biotech, one of India’s major vaccine manufacturers, the project brings together academia – the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) in Pune and the Indian Institute of Technology in Indore – and industry players such as PredOmix Technologies in Gurgaon.Lab-grown antibodies have been shown to block coronaviurs infections in laboratories in the Netherlands and Israel, and could emerge as a critical tool to stop the spread of the disease. Monoclonal antibodies are man-made proteins that act like natural antibodies and work by identifying and binding to the virus to destroy it.CSIR’s project is aimed at creating an alternate therapeutic regimen by generating highly effective and specific human monoclonal antibodies capable of neutralising SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19.“Although efforts are underway for the development of drugs and vaccines for controlling the Covid-19 pandemic, these are slow and expensive processes with uncertainties. Therefore, an alternate therapeutic regimen for early deployment is critical,” Bharat Biotech said in a statement.Bharat Biotech chairman Krishna Ella said: “The purpose of vaccination is to protect the healthy against future infections and it alone may not provide the complete solution. We feel monoclonal antibody therapy will provide a viable option. The question is of how to treat those individuals who are already infected?“Plus, we do not yet know how effective an anti-SARS-CoV2 vaccine will be in elderly people and those with co-morbidities. Given the large number of Indians suffering from hypertension, diabetes and heart diseases, this becomes an important issue.”Talking about the novel antibodies approach, Ella said: “While Israel and the Netherlands have recently announced the development of virus-neutralising antibodies, our approach is to develop a powerful cocktail of neutralising antibodies that can also simultaneously block mutational variants of the virus.“We are fast-tracking the development process, to make the antibodies available within the next six months and thus improve the treatment efficacy.”Ella said plasma therapy had shown some promise but inherent problems associated with the approach severely limited its wider use. Large-scale deployment of plasma therapy is limited by the availability of plasma. “There is also a challenge in carefully screening convalescent plasma for the presence of other infections that could be unwittingly transferred to the recipient,” he said.NMITLI is the largest public-private-partnership effort under CSIR within the research and development domain in the country. It looks beyond today’s technology and seeks to build, capture and retain for India a leadership position by synergising the best competencies of publicly funded research institutions, academia and private industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-eyes-human-monoclonal-antibody-therapy-for-covid-19/story-Unw8L9c89PsMnQIjH9Cd7J.html

It will take less time,” said Vimal Goswami, chief engineer of the project ‘Hirak,’ under which the road stretch was built by Border Road Organisation( BRO).Following the inauguration, Rajnath Singh tweeted, “Delighted to inaugurate the Link Road to Mansarovar Yatra today. The BRO achieved road connectivity from Dharchula to Lipulekh (China Border) known as Kailash-Mansarovar Yatra Route. Also flagged off a convoy of vehicles from Pithoragarh to Gunji through video conferencing”.Lauding the role of BRO engineers, Singh added, “I congratulate the BRO engineers and personnel whose dedication made this achievement possible. Team BRO has done tremendous work in recent years and played a significant role in connecting the border areas”.Rajnath Singh also flagged off a caravan of nine vehicles from Pithoragarh to Gunji to indicate that both passengers and load can be sent by the new road stretch through mountainous terrain, said Vimal GoswamiUnion road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had announced last year that this road stretch would be completed by April 2020.According to BRO officials, while machines used in construction of the road had been imported from Australia, the air connectivity to supply materials and fuel for it was ensured by constructing a small airstrip for army and air force helicopters at Budhi Camp, the upper portion of the road stretch.“This helped us to facilitate movement of helicopters, supplying material for the construction work.” said the BRO officer.“While 51 km long part beyond Buddi had been constructed earlier, the stretch between Lakhanpur to Bundi posed many challenges and took much time,” said Vimal Goswami.The construction of this strategic road stretch began in 2008, and it was scheduled to be completed in 2013 but got delayed due to the tough terrain between Nazang to Bundi village.“The 15 km stretch was the most challenging. Its construction was outsourced in 2015 to a private company under technical guidance of BRO engineers, which completed this part despite all odds,” said Goswami.The locals are also happy with the new road stretch.“This road is a boon for residents of all seven villages in Vyans valley. It used to take 5 days to reach their high altitude villages from Dharchula and vice versa. Now it will take only 4 hours.“It will also help the winter and summer migration of tribal people to the upper Himalayan region. Overall it will strengthen border security and boost the economy in the bordering villages,” said Shalu Datal, a social worker based in Dharchula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-inaugurates-kailash-mansarovar-road-link-via-video-conference/story-kvQ89OKstk8FmYtvNzNXdO.html

The petiton argued that the government cannot meddle with human life by allowing crowds to gather outside liquor shops.As the government took first steps to relax the Covid-19 lockdown to revive the economy, hundreds queued up at liquor stores in New Delhi and other cities.Some stores in parts of Delhi had to be closed due to the large number of people gathered there.The Delhi government even imposed a special tax of 70 per cent on retail liquor purchases to deter large gatherings but that did not stop people from coming out and heading towards the liquor shops.It then introduced a token system which people can buy online. The move is aimed at stopping people from coming out and gather outside liquor shops.The Uttar Pradesh government recently announced an increase in prices of all categories of liquor, including country liquor, to mop up additional revenue of Rs 2,350 crore.A similar plea has also been filed in the Delhi High Court seeking direction to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi to start online sale of liquor to ensure social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic.The petitioner sought direction to the Delhi government to evolve a proper policy to start the online sale of liquor and deliver it to the consumers’ homes at a time when the entire machinery of the country is tirelessly working to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.After the lockdown was extended till May 17, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued new guidelines allowing liquor shops to open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-should-consider-indirect-sale-home-delivery-of-liquor-observes-supreme-court/story-qsjPvnQ3gfi8MAL1BO5xgL.html

The workers sleeping on rail tracks were crushed to death by a goods train on Friday morning.“Two days ago I had tweeted why the central and state governments are oblivious of the fact that thousands of migrant workers are still trudging to their home states,” Chidambaram said.“It is obvious that the transport policy of providing buses and trains to transport migrant workers was poorly designed, planned, coordinated and implemented,” he said in a series of tweets.The decision to provide buses and trains was “hopelessly belated”, he alleged, adding that lakhs of persons had already begun their trek to their home states when the decision was made.Once the policy was announced, the government should have gone to the rescue of the trekkers and provided buses or trains to them to continue their journey, the former Union minister said.“The tragedy that happened this morning could have been avoided if governments had gone to the rescue of the migrant workers in time,” Chidambaram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hopelessly-belated-chidambaram-on-decision-to-provide-trains-to-migrants/story-dwXQadYaUBqZVrPtNaIQHI.html

08-05-2020||India||Facing outrage, Ghaziabad high-rise withdraws notice to stop entry of doctors, healthcare workers||The owners association of a high-rise in Vaishali withdrew a notice asking doctors and healthcare workers living in the complex to stay in Delhi until the end of the Covid-19 lockdown after the measure was strongly criticised on social media.The Neelpadam Kunj Apartment Owners Association issued a communication on May 7 for stopping the entry and exit of doctors and healthcare workers from May 10, and asked them to make temporary arrangements for staying in Delhi while the lockdown is in force.The association withdrew the notice within hours after it was criticised by netizens on Thursday night following its circulation on social media. It issued another communication in which it said its “advisory notice was issued on the evening of May 7, 2020 by mistake and has been withdrawn in the night of May 7, 2020”.The association’s office-bearers said their communication to residents was based on a notification issued by Ghaziabad’s municipal commissioner to his zonal in-charges on May 5.The municipal commissioner’s notification had said the zonal in-charges should get in touch with RWAs and local councillors and request doctors and healthcare workers, who live in Ghaziabad and work in Delhi, to make arrangements for their stay in the national capital during the lockdown.“We had issued a letter on Thursday evening on the basis of the letter issued by the municipal commissioner. But our letter was withdrawn on Thursday night and another letter was issued about the withdrawal of our first letter. We didn’t have clarity about the letter from the municipal commissioner, which was in the form of an appeal and non-binding,” said Ram Tiwari, president of the board of managers of the association.He said about 35 families live in Neelpadam Kunj, one of the oldest high-rises in Ghaziabad that comprises 568 flats.“Our first letter was also in the form of an advisory and never implemented. It was to be implemented from May 10. But no doctors or paramedical staff or healthcare workers were stopped from our side. We have one positive case in our high-rise and the patient’s family members have tested negative and returned home. This is why the administration sealed a portion of the building,” Tiwari said.Other owners’ associations and RWAs have not implemented the municipal commissioner’s appeal. The controversy started after Ghaziabad’s chief medical officer NK Gupta wrote a letter on April 30 with the heading “appeal” to municipal commissioner Dinesh Chandra.Gupta’s letter came in the wake of a number of Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad attributed to medically acquired infections. Other cases in Ghaziabad are also related to doctors and healthcare workers getting infected and their neighbourhoods being sealed.On May 5, Chandra forwarded Gupta’s letter to his zonal in-charges. He maintained his letter was an appeal and RWAs and councillors were to make “humble appeals” to doctors and healthcare workers. He told HT on Thursday the letter was issued in public interest and wasn’t binding.“We have also reiterated this to the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Ghaziabad. The appeal is non-binding. But it was issued with an intention to prevent people in high-rises from getting infected through medically acquired infections,” Gupta said, adding 25% of cases in the district are linked to medically acquired infections.The IMA’s office-bearers will hold a meeting with the Ghaziabad district magistrate on Friday to discuss the issue.“Doctors and healthcare personnel are taking best possible precautions about infections. We feel the issue should have been taken up at the government level (UP and Delhi governments) to make arrangements for doctors and healthcare workers and should not have been publicised. It should have been for other people involved in providing essential services,” said IMA Ghaziabad president VB Jindal.“We don’t want such a stigma which may be seen as discrimination. We feel RWAs or councillors shouldn’t be given powers to restrict doctors,” he added.The Ghaziabad district magistrate had issued orders for strict sealing of the border with Delhi and cited six positive cases that emerged after local residents travelled to the national capital. On April 26, the district magistrate issued an advisory to commuters going to Delhi to leave Ghaziabad’s borders by 9am and come back only after 6pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facing-outrage-ghaziabad-high-rise-withdraws-notice-to-stop-entry-of-doctors-healthcare-workers/story-lYvxPQKiS9EvGaM1IMxG8N.html

TASMAC has a total of 5,300 outlets and employs more than 25,000 people. Choas prevailed at retail outlets in several districts including Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Chengalpattu.Police had to resort to mild lathi-charge in some of the districts as desperate tipplers gave social distancing norms a go-by. Police had a tough time controlling crowds wanting to buy liquor as all TASMAC outlets have been closed in the state since March 24. Preliminary estimates of the state government indicated that Rs 150 crore worth of liquor was sold in Tamil Nadu.The government’s move to open the TASMAC outlets had attracted criticism from opposition parties including DMK’s M K Stalin, Congress party and others. However, the state government struggling for revenue had decided to go ahead with the sales. In 2018-19, TASMAC alone generated revenues of Rs 31,157.83 crore.Meanwhile two more deaths were also reported because of Covid-19 on Thursday taking the cumulative tally to 37. Out of the 580 new cases registered on Thursday, government officials admitted that 316 of them were from Chennai with bulk of them being attributed to the Koyambedu market cluster. As of Thursday, there are 3,822 active Covid-19 cases in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-sees-liquor-sales-of-rs-150-crore-on-day-1-of-reopening/story-WQImr9eKT2BnNlsXwpSqML.html
08-05-2020||India||AIIMS in Delhi to resume health care services in phased manner||The Delhi-based All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is likely to open up its health care services in a phased manner from next week after it shut down all but its emergency services on March 24 following the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.“We’re looking at re-starting limited outpatient departments (OPDs) and surgical departments. The opening up will start in a phased manner,” said Dr. Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS, Delhi.On March 24, the hospital had shut down all its non-emergency departments, including surgical departments and specialty clinics, and only kept its emergency open for non-Covid-19 patients.The decision was in line with a Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’s directive, urging hospitals to postpone all non-essential services and elective procedures in a bid to free up ventilators and intensive care unit (ICU) beds for Covid-19 positive cases.In early April, the hospital had started teleconsultation facility for its follow-up cases, where a patient can book an appointment online.“The departments that are managing well through telemedicine will be asked to continue. We’ll begin with semi-emergency and comfortable day-care surgeries that don’t require too much manpower, and also minimal infrastructure,” said Dr. Guleria.In the first phase, gallstone removal, hernia, and other such surgeries will be conducted, as they require less number of hospitalisation days ensuring beds are not occupied for long and also minimum use of ventillator.The hospital has set up its trauma centre and its cancer hospital in Jhajjar, Haryana, as dedicated Covid-19 hospitals.“Dedicated Covid-19 facility goes beyond hospital infrastructure and largely involves nurturing human resources. We’ll have to divide our staff into Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 groups. Simultaneously, we need to keep a close watch on the surge in Covid-19 positive cases. Initially, we’ll start with opening up a limited number of departments, and depending upon how the situation evolves over the next few weeks, we may open up some more, if the Covid-19 curve remains under control,” said Dr. Guleria.“There’s a huge risk of a non-Covid-19 patient testing positive. We’ve had a similar experience recently, where a trauma patient tested Covid-19 positive. The challenge in the gradual opening up of departments is to factor these critical aspects in mind. We’ll have to monitor the evolving situation closely,” he said. “Everything has to be thought through. We’ve to re-define our new normal. The medical practice will undergo a paradigm shift soon,” he added.The central government-run Safdarjung Hospital has also opened up its outpatient clinics for new patients from Wednesday.The opening up of more hospitals in the national capital, which had earlier restricted its services to emergency only, will ease the burden on the Delhi government-run hospitals, as most of them have been running on more than 100% capacity. The constraints were drawn to the Centre’s attention by the Delhi government earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-in-delhi-to-resume-health-care-services-in-phased-manner/story-W6D5p6ZTPVmYcpU1LBLmuK.html

I would request the Prime Minister to start talking with the chief ministers not as the boss but as a colleague as someone who is helping them,” Gandhi told a news conference.“Forget about Congress-ruled states, BJP-ruled states or CPI(M)-ruled. They are all Indian chief ministers and should all be working together with the Prime Minister. If I was to advise the Prime Minister even though it is not my place definitely he should call to every chief minister in 1-2 days in a partnership type call,” he said.The Congress leader told reporters through video-conferencing that the government must start giving transparency to its actions by cooperating with the states and making them partners in decision-making.He said the lockdown is not an on-off switch and it is a transition which requires cooperation of all – the Centre, chief ministers, district magistrates and the people of India.“We need to decentralise power in dealing with the virus. If we keep this fight only in the PMO, we will lose. The Prime Minister must devolve power. If we centralise, there will be a calamity. The Prime Minister has to trust chief ministers and the chief ministers in turn have to trust the district magistrates,” he added.This was Gandhi’s second press conference during the lockdown period. The former Congress chief had earlier addressed the media on April 16, when he insisted that the lockdown is not a solution to defeat Covid-19 but a pause button and stressed the need for having a comprehensive exit strategy in place to ensure that the coronavirus does not come back once the restrictions are lifted.This time also, Gandhi called upon the government to tell the people what criteria it would use to open the lockdown or continue it post May 17.He reiterated his demand for immediate direct cash transfer to 50% households in the country to enable the people to tide over the crisis triggered by the Covid-19.Gandhi said the financial assistance is immediately needed because the Indian economy has stopped and the businesses have started collapsing.“There is a need to start businesses immediately otherwise there will be catastrophe and we might end up creating more problems. India is all about domestic consumption and we need to start the engine now. We are losing time. I believe there is a sense within the government that this might lead to large deficit and create problems externally. I would tell them stop worrying about that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hold-regular-conversations-with-cms-make-them-partners-in-dealing-with-the-pandemic-rahul-to-pm/story-FOkqv4GzDv3HQxgYobGm6L.html

State transport minister Anil Parab held talks with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray during a strategy meeting held on Thursday to discuss the measures that need to be taken to aggressively contain the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in the state.“We’ve made arrangements for 10,000 state-run buses to ferry these stranded people in a group of 22-24 people. We’ve asked divisional officers to set up a control room to keep the stranded people informed about the bus service,” Parab said.On Thursday, Maharashtra recorded the second-highest spike in Covid-19 positive cases on a single day, as it reported 1,216 new cases. The maximum number of Covid-19 related deaths on a single day in the state was also reported on Thursday at 43, taking the overall toll to 694.Maharashtra has recorded over 1,000 cases in the last two days, raising concerns over the spread of the pandemic.In Mumbai, the epicentre of the outbreak in the state, 680 new Covid-19 positive cases were detected on Thursday, as the total count rose to 11,394.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the government has directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities to start aggressive institutional quarantine to curb the spread of Covid-19 cases, which has also been suggested by a visiting Central team. He, however, admitted that social distancing norms cannot always be ensured for residents, who live cheek-by-jowl in cramped tenements such as in the congested Dharavi slums, where institutional quarantine may work as the best precautionary measure.CM Thackeray has hinted at extending the ongoing lockdown restrictions till May 31. On Thursday, the state government amended an earlier order and issued a clarification that there is no need to attach a medical certificate to the registration form to facilitate the journey for stranded people back to their respective districts. The decision was taken after serpentine queues were seen outside private practitioners’ chambers and following allegations that some doctors were overcharging the stranded for the medical certificate.The BMC authorities have reserved 3,343 rooms in 88 city hotels to quarantine the 1,900 stranded Indian nationals, who started flying into the city from Thursday evening by special flights from abroad.The incoming Indian nationals are being allowed to move into the hotels for a compulsory 14-day quarantine after they undergo screening by a team of BMC doctors.The state health department has conducted 2,02,105 tests at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra. So far, 1,83,880 people have tested negative.Presently, Maharashtra has 1,087 active containment zones. Around 12,021 survey teams, comprising doctors and paramedical staff, have screened over 51.76 lakh people in the state for SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, the health department officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-govt-issues-sop-to-deploy-state-buses-to-ferry-stranded-people/story-b9WwoxkhVOgBrQMPUPSjQP.html
08-05-2020||India||Contagious skin disease hits desert foxes in Rajasthan, ecologists raise alarm||Ecologists working in and around the Desert National Park in Rajasthan have raised an alarm over mange, a contagious skin disease, in desert fox. On Thursday, they spotted six animals with the disease, cause by infestation of mite, in Fatehgarh area of Jaisalmer.Earlier, Wildlife Institute of India researchers working in the area recorded a fox with mild mange disease symptoms in Sudashree ‘A’ enclosure. Three more foxes with mange-like symptoms have been reported from outside the sanctuary area in and around the field firing range in Pokhran.This has put the wildlife officials on alert even as the officials of the animal husbandry department are managing mange in domestic camels in Jaisalmer.“The field staff has been alerted to report any new occurrences and the animal with symptoms are being tracked so that in case of a need, appropriate intervention could be undertaken,” said a department note sent to Jaipur by the office of deputy conservator of forest (wildlife), Desert National Park.Mange was first reported in the national park in 2006. After that, every year, the occurrence has increased. “In last one year, we have observed about 30-35% desert foxes with infection, 5-8% of them with severe infection (without hair on body) in which stage the animal loses its appetite for hunting and is always scratching body before finally dying due to maggot infection on deep scratches,” said ecologist Dr Sumit Dookia.According to the state forest department’s wildlife census of 2019, there are about 1,000 foxes in Jaisalmer. “My guess about the infection in population is of around 30% in the above mentioned areas and this needs attention of the state authorities,” said Dookia.He said major areas of infection are Sanvtha, Nedan, Sanavada, Lathi, Bhadariya, Odhaniya-Chacha, Dholiya (all in Pokhran block) and Sam, Sudasari, Ganga, Bidha, Jamra, Nimba, and few surrounding areas (all in Desert National Park).Dookia, assistant professor in School of Environment Management at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University in New Delhi, worked on a UGC-funded project on ecology of desert fox from 2012 to 2015. “During that time, my research scholar continuously followed many desert foxes with mange infection. The ultimate end is all of them died and at the same time village dogs were also seen with infection,” he said.Dookia said that even though Indian fox is also present in same habitat, but none of them were found with this infection.The note from DCF said the disease is self-limiting “so there’s hardly any chance of rapid mass spread in the wildlife population”. “As the disease does not take the shape of an epidemic threatening the fox population, at this point, this office does not find it necessary to make any clinical intervention,” the note added.Principal secretary of forest department Sreya Guha said the animal husbandry department is dealing with the outbreak in domestic camels; forest department is on alert.Bhawani Singh Rathore, additional director (health) in animal husbandry department said they were doing survey of the affected areas to provide treatment to camels and undertake control activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contagious-skin-disease-hits-desert-foxes-in-rajasthan-ecologists-raise-alarm/story-4JKZJ5jT4BLojqb0uXuBRL.html

Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma made the announcement on Twitter on Friday morning after the student was found positive for Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease. “A PG student at GMCH has tested Covid positive last night. Consequently, we have to screen everyone who came in contact with him and sanitize the entire GMCH premises....we have to close the hospital for new patients for next few days,” Sarma tweeted.“Although we are closing the hospital for new patients, special arrangements will be in place for patients already admitted and collection of new swab samples. Soliciting cooperation and understanding from all in the interest of public safety,” he added.The GMCH hostel where the doctor was staying and another hostel have been declared as containment zones, and all residents asked to stay indoors.Three persons in Guwahati and four more in Silchar, too, tested positive, taking the state’s tally to 53 cases.The new cases came to light after one of the passengers, a notorious car thief from Dhekiajuli in Sonipur district, was tested positive. All other passengers of the bus and drivers have been put in quarantine facilities and 11 areas in Silchar declared as containment zones.“The bus reached Silchar with permission from district magistrate of Ajmer. No social distancing norms were followed as it carried 42 passengers,” Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Thursday.“While other passengers were asked to be in home quarantine, swab samples of one were taken as precaution. His samples tested positive. The person has several police cases registered against him,” he added.The incident has led Assam government to revise its strategy of home quarantine for people returning to the state following relaxations allowed by the Union home ministry. Earlier only those who showed symptoms were to be placed in facility quarantine or tested for Covid-19.“From now all persons returning from red zones in other parts of the country will be put in compulsory facility quarantine for at least three days (even if they are asymptomatic) till results of their swab tests are available,” said Sarma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-s-biggest-hospital-closes-as-pg-student-tests-covid-19-positive/story-ucGVhAUQ7aZxMp2CgyDfOL.html

Subsequently, they were kept in quarantine facility in a police station from where they escaped on Thursday night,” said the Collector.The officer said that total 47 migrant labourers came back from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to Dantewada and were kept at a quarantine facility in Aranpur police station area before allowing them to go their native villages.“No symptom of coronavirus was found in these labourers,” said the collector.“We have informed sarpanch and secretary of the concerned village panchayat but till now they have not reached to their village. It is presently not possible for administration and police to reach Nahadi village because it is core area of Maoists,” said the Collector.No case of Covid-19 was reported from Bastar division which comprises seven districts - Bastar, Kanker, Kondagaon, Narayanpur, Dantewada, Sukma and Bijapur.Total 59 cases have been reported in Chhattisgarh till now in which 38 recovered and discharged from hospital.Two patients of Covid-19, including one nursing officer of a quarantine centre, were discharged from AIIMS in state capital Raipur on Thursday after they tested negative in the second consecutive test.The nursing officer is 35-year-old while another patient, who hails from Surajpur, is 25.Presently, AIIMS has 21 active Covid-19 positive patients and all are in stable condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/22-migrant-labourers-escape-from-covid-19-quarantine-centre-in-chhattisgarh/story-qy2BuODN4ILpLp3YDjl0OI.html

08-05-2020||India||‘Lockdown not an on-off switch’: Rahul Gandhi asks govt to spell out post-May 17 strategy||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Friday that the government needs to tell the people about its strategy to open up the country as well as the economy after the Covid-19 lockdown ends on May 17.“The government now has to give a little bit of transparency on its actions. We need to understand, when they open, what is the criteria for that, what are the boxes they want ticked off before they actually start to open,” Gandhi said in a digital press briefing.“The lockdown is not a key, that you switch it on and it’s gone. It requires number of things to happen. It requires a psychological change. The government needs to understand that it’s not an on-off switch,” he added.The former Congress president also talked about the coronavirus disease Covid-19, which has triggered the nationwide lockdown. He said that barring a few categories of people, the disease is not dangerous.“The disease is dangerious for a few categories of people. It is dangerous for old people, for those who have diabetes, hypertension etc. But other than that, it is not a dangerous disease. So we have to make a psychological change in the mind of the people. Currently, people are very scared. The government, if it wants to open up, will have to turn this fear into a sense of confidence,” said Gandhi.He added that opening up has to be a transition. “You need to have a strategy.”Gandhi has been holding discussions with public intellectuals through video conferencing where he has been talking about Covid-19 and what India needs to do going forward. Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan and Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee were his first two guests.Two days ago, Congress president Sonia Gandhi had asked the central government to spell out its strategy whether it will lift or continue with the nationwide lockdown on May 17.“What after May 17? What criteria is the government using to judge how long the lockdown will continue?” she had said in her opening remarks at a video-conferencing of party’s chief ministers and senior leaders.Addressing the meeting, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, “We need to know, as Soniaji said, what will happen after the lockdown 3.0? Soniaji has already pointed out. CM’s need to deliberate and ask as to what is the strategy of Govt of India to get the country out of lockdown?”The party had recently announced that it will pay for the train travel of stranded migrant workers, a move that triggered a slugfest between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Opposition party accused the government of being insensitive to the plight of stranded migrant workers while the BJP claimed that railways was bearing 85% of the fare cost, and state governments had to pay 15%, thus allowing migrants to go back home free of cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-not-an-on-off-switch-rahul-gandhi-asks-govt-to-spell-out-post-may-17-strategy/story-0hV8divxr4gTXFjBWOk45O.html

Residents of five villages have been evacuated to safer places, and there was no need for people in other villages and residential colonies to be shifted, he said. “There is nothing to worry for the people of Visakhapatnam,” Meena added.State authorities and officials from LG Polymers said they were investigating what caused the leak of styrene gas, which is toxic and injurious to human health, but a preliminary situation report by district officials said the trigger was a malfunction in equipment, which caused the temperature to rise and the organic compound styrene – normally a liquid – to vaporise. The people who died on Thursday were identified as: Appala Narsamma (45), Kundana Sriya (6), A Chandramouli (19), Ch Ganga Raju (48), B Narayanamma (35), N Greeshma (9), Meka Krishna Murthy (72), P Varalaxmi (38), N Nani (40), P Shankar Rao (40) and V Nukaraju (60). The twelfth person who was declared dead at Kothavalasa primary health centre was Gangadhara Chowdary (32). “All of them belonged to Venkatapuram and Gopalapatnam villages,” the police commissioner said.According to Andhra Medical College principal Dr Sudhakar, 193 people, including 47 children, are undergoing treatment at state-run King George Hospital, and another 100 are being treated at different hospitals in the city.“Those in the KGH are all out of danger. They would be discharged later in the day after they recover completely and after ensuring that the situation in their villages has become normal,” he said.Panic gripped several villages near the LG Polymers plant at R R Venkatapuram on the outskirts of Visakhapatnam late on Thursday night over reports of fresh fumes with pungent smell emanating from the factory. People descended on streets and tried to leave their villages. The situation was quickly brought under control.

Also, 11 areas in Cachar district have been declared as containment zones,” the minister said.“The bus reached Silchar on Wednesday after the Ajmer district magistrate allowed it to travel, despite nationwide lockdown restrictions. All 42 passengers on board of the bus didn’t follow any social distancing norms,” Sarma said.“While other passengers were asked to be quarantined at home, swab samples of one of them were taken as a precautionary measure. His samples tested Covid-19 positive,” he added.The incident has led Assam government to revise its strategy regarding home quarantine for people returning to the state following relaxations allowed by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.Earlier, only those who tested Covid-19 positive or showed symptoms were to be placed in a quarantine facility.“Now, all those returning from red zones in other parts of the country will be put under compulsory quarantine at a facility for at least three days even if they are asymptomatic and till the time the results of their swab samples tests are available,” said Sarma.The state government is also planning to introduce a daily quota system of how many people returning from other states would be allowed to enter Assam in the wake of the Ajmer incident.So far, Assam Police has issued 375 passes allowing entry of 2,056 people returning to the state from other parts of the country. While permits of 3,420 other passengers are under process.CHALLENGING PHASESarma raised concerns about the challenging phase amid the easing of lockdown restrictions.“We’ve entered a challenging phase, as people are coming back from other states and may turn out of the carriers of the viral infection. SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease, won’t be lax because of the government’s relaxations. I request people to be careful and not to step out of their homes unless absolutely necessary,” Sarma said.The state government will impose a fine of Rs 500 under the provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, from Friday against anyone found not wearing a mask in public places.The government has spent Rs 60 crore in providing assistance of Rs 2,000 each for nearly two lakh migrant workers, who have been stranded outside the state because of the pandemic. Sarma pledged that the financial aid would continue for the next few weeks.Similarly, the government has decided to give Rs 5,000 each to students, who are looking to come back home from western and southern parts of the country and Rs 3,000 and Rs 2,000 from northern and eastern parts, respectively.Those students interested to return can call at 18003453525 or email to assamstudenthelpdesk@gmail.com. Students will receive the cash only after they return to Assam.Also, all the villagers in the state’s 25,000-odd villages have started undergoing health check-ups from Thursday, and their swab samples, if necessary, will be collected to conduct Covid-19 tests. The villagers’ health check-up regime is likely to be completed within a month, Sarma added.CHANGE IN ACADEMIC SESSION?The state government is considering introducing changes in the school calendar because of the impact of lockdown restrictions and pandemic’s aftershocks.Though school session in Assam follow the calendar-year format, such as from January to December, the government may extend it till March for the current session like other parts of the country and the next session may begin in April.“This year we’re announcing summer break for schools from May 1 to May 31 because of the lockdown. Even if the lockdown is lifted after May 17, students don’t have to come to school till the end of the month,” Sarma, who also holds the education portfolio, said.The minister announced that the secondary and higher secondary examination results would be announced in June and instead of hard copies digitised mark sheets would be made available for students online.“Students can take admissions in schools and colleges using these digital mark sheets. The admission process will also be conducted online. School and college authorities can verify the mark sheets from the official board website,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-ajmer-sharif-returnees-new-worry-for-assam-govt/story-dCuvSnG4fxykevzbIXYNMK.html
08-05-2020||India||Maharashtra train accident: How 16 migrant labourers were killed||A train in India crashed into a group of migrant workers walking along the railroad tracks on to their way back to their home state on Friday, killing at least 16.The railway ministry has launched a probe into the incident.According to railway officials, the workers were walking towards their home state Madhya Pradesh after they lost their jobs due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Most public transportation has already been cancelled due to the lockdown.These workers had started from Jalna to go to Bhusawal (both in Maharashtra) - a distance of 157 kilometre - and had planned to go to their native places Umariya and Shahdol in Madhya Pradesh, which is about 850 kilometres away.According to railways, they left Jalna at 7 pm on Thursday and initially walked on road and later onto the track towards Aurangabad. After walking for about 36 kilometres, these workers started feeling tired and sat on the track between Karnad and Badnapur railway stations for taking some rest. They gradually went into deep sleep.It was at 5.22 am that the approaching goods train ran over these labourers, the railways ministry said in a statement. The driver tried to stop the train but couldn’t do so in time, it added.There were 14 people on the track, two adjacent to the track and three away from it, the railways said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the deaths on Twitter. “Extremely anguished by the loss of lives due to the rail accident in Aurangabad, Maharashtra. Have spoken to Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and he is closely monitoring the situation. All possible assistance required is being provided,” he tweeted.Amid the nationwide lockdown, thousands of migrant workers stranded in several other cities have been on an unending toil to return to their native places on foot.The interstate bus service, passenger, mail and express train services have been suspended since March 24.The Railways has started running ‘Shramik Special’ trains to transport the stranded migrants to their native places since May 1. Till Thursday railways has run 201 ‘Shramik Special’ trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-train-accident-how-16-migrant-labourers-were-killed/story-kdJHMdZU3T2ubxXNdnUKYL.html
08-05-2020||India||‘Lax environmental norms during recession could lead to industries bypassing environmental safeguards’||Inland waterways, hydroelectric projects up to 25 megawatts, small irrigation projects, some industrial parks or housing projects will only require an “environment permission” from authorities to begin construction under the new draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) notification, 2020. These projects’ environmental impacts will not be assessed in detail because they are believed to have a small environmental footprint, according to reviews of the draft by several researchers.On March 23, the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) had issued draft EIA notification 2020, which is expected to bring major changes in the way infrastructure projects such as industries, mines, large townships are granted environmental clearance and regulated. The EIA notification 2020, which will replace the EIA notification 2006, has been in the eye of a storm, as environmental groups and political leaders have been calling for debate and clarity on what these changes mean for the country’s fragile ecosystem.Kanchi Kohli and Manju Menon, both of whom specialise in infrastructure, ecology, and resource politics at the New Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research, have reviewed the new draft recently and shared their thoughts with HT. Edited excerpts from the interview:Is the draft EIA 2020 significantly different from EIA notification 2006? What do you make of this new draft?At first glance, it seems that the draft EIA 2020 is not very different from the EIA notification 2006. It appears that EIA 2020 only collates all the amendments, executive clarifications, and the court directions that were already in effect between 2006 and now. This draft puts it all together into one document.What makes this draft so unique is that this is the government’s thinking when our economy is crashing like never before because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. This draft creates a complacency that may be dangerous. It makes one feel like this is familiar and that things just got a bit worse. But that is the farthest thing from truth because all the assumptions that the EIA system is based on are under scrutiny now. We may not have too many major projects coming up due to recession. If projects do come up they may not have funds or may not want to invest in environmental safeguards and they may want resources handed to them cheaply so they can reap profits even during a recession. If this is a possibility we are looking at, should we not be thinking carefully before we put this EIA mechanism in place?The draft EIA 2020 has been notified at a time when there is a massive economic slowdown due to Covid-19. If notified, will EIA 2020 boost economic growth by simplifying processes for industries and infrastructure?Environmental approvals cannot boost the economy. Successive governments have propagated this myth by calling environmental approval procedures a hurdle. The ministry has made the frequency of approvals and ease of securing them as its target objective based on this misplaced logic. It keeps recirculating this false narrative of environment vs. development. Speedy approvals may, at best, help to secure investments from the market and finances from banks in the short term. At worst, if approvals are given to wrong projects, they can bring entire sectors, if not the whole economy crashing. We have examples of this in the 2014 Coalgate scandal and the Hydel-gate of the dams in the north-east. The real estate sector is also a good case in point.What does the draft EIA 2020 mean for India’s environment? How does it affect existing environmental standards?The draft has brought 43 sectors within its regulatory purview but it thins down the regulatory process for them. The draft lays out a six-step process and many definitions, giving the impression that there is an elaborate process of scrutiny in place before a project is approved.However, all this needs to be read with the range of exemptions and provisos. For instance, many projects would only require an Environmental Permission (EP) without detailed assessments or public hearings. The draft is also lenient towards expansion and “modernisation” projects that basically use more advanced technologies. For instance, all projects can enhance their capacity by 10% without any appraisals and only filing an online application. The draft proposes that the regulators take the project’s word for these aspects.The draft sets severe limits to the quality of project appraisal, increases the validity of the approval period, gives exemptions to more sectors from the public consultation, allows lenient monitoring and compliance protocols. These are all examples of lowering the standards of environmental regulation of projects.How does the draft EIA impact people? Does it have enough provisions for impacted communities to be heard?Common people have always been and continue to be peripheral to the EIA notification. The public hearing process has been in the notification since 1997, and it still remains with its form and purpose immensely watered down. For example, the EIA 2006 notification had reduced the scope of public hearings. No wonder, when people came to the hearing to speak about how profoundly the project would impact their resources, they simply ticked the procedural boxes.Yet, this public space is very important for all of us. As people, who may be affected by projects, we need information about the project, we need to know from its proponents why they think it’s a good idea to promote it and we need our views about it to be heard by all the stakeholders. This is a reasonable expectation to have in a democracy.Public hearings are still there in the notification but it has been contained a lot by reducing the notice period from 30 to 20 days and by exempting many projects from public hearings altogether. There is a clause in the draft that says that there should be ‘no postponement of date, time, venue of a public hearing’ unless some untoward emergency situation occurs and the postponement will be done only on the recommendations of the authorities concerned.There is a contentious provision in the draft on regularising EIA violations or projects, which have already come up without following due processes. What will be the impact of this provision? Can we expect more projects to violate?This is one of the more significant aspects of the draft EIA 2020. The clause is a big public admission from the government that the EIA system suffers from plenty of violations and this is systemic. This acknowledgment has come due to the hard work of many people and organisations, who have pointed out project violations, documented them, and taken them to task. It seems that the government is ready to admit that development projects have operated outside the framework of the law. So, whether this problem of rampant violations should be handled through statutory law or through government regulation? In this proposal, the government is trying to deal with violations like they are remediation projects.We are not all that confident that the government can carry through this attention it wants to give to violations because it has historically played a facilitative role to development projects in its job as an environmental regulator. It appears difficult that this same institution can restrain projects and extract from them both remediation and compensation costs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lax-environmental-norms-during-recession-could-lead-to-industries-bypassing-environmental-safeguards/story-P3mAqONXrfLsauB8321lfK.html

08-05-2020||India||Pak launches terror’s new face in Kashmir, Imran Khan follows up on Twitter||The Resistance Front, the brand-new terror group that has rushed to take responsibility for major terror attacks and firefights in Jammu and Kashmir over the past few weeks, is being controlled by three top handlers of the Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan, an intelligence report submitted to national security planners in New Delhi has said.The TRF was launched late last year after Parliament scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and divided the state into two centrally-administered union territories, Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir.Terror from Pak gets a makeoverThe exercise is designed to give terror in Kashmir an indigenious face to ward off international pressure, particularly from the anti-terror financing watchdog FATF, over Pakistan sponsoring Islamist terror groups and what New Delhi describes as its jihadi terror factories.This objective, a security official said, reflected the choice of names for the Inter Services Intelligence’s recent terror initiatives such as The Resistance Front or the low-key JK Pir Panjal Peace Forum. These names don’t have a religious label but suggest that it is a homebred.THE NAME GAMEThe Resistance Front was launched to give terror in Kashmir an indigenous faceTRF was conceived to ward off international pressure on Pakistan from FATFThree top handlers of Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan control the TRFLashkar-e-Taiba terrorists form the core of the TRFTRF has claimed responsibility of most major firefights with security forcesOfficials say this is a facade, to help the terror group gain space in the public mindThe intelligence report said the Lashkar leaders formed the core of the TRF.“TRF is being controlled from Pakistan by top three Lashkar handlers: Sajad Jatt for South Kashmir, Khalid for Central Kashmir and Hanzala Adnan for North Kashmir,” the intelligence report accessed by Hindustan Times said.At this point of time, security officials said, the effort appeared to be to project the TRF as a formidable group to attract local recruits. Like when five terrorists and an equal number of army soldiers were killed in the Keran sector in early April, the TRF’s social media managers in Pakistan claimed responsibility.Also Read: From a Twitter handle, the story of Pakistan’s new terror group for KashmirThe group even claimed responsibility for the gunfight in Handwara this weekend that cost security forces five lives including that of an army colonel. One of the two terrorists killed in the operation was later identified by the police as Lashkar commander Haider, a Pakistani national. The other was a local terrorist, a resident of Handwara.“Almost every TRF terrorist, arrested or killed, has been listed in our records under the Lashkar-e-Taiba,” Jammu and Kashmir Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar said. Lately, TRF had expanded their net and were also inducting Hizbul terrorists, he said.“The idea is to show the world that what Kashmir has is local militancy,” said KumarAlso Watch : Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo eliminated: All the key detailsImran Khan wades inAs Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday tweeted a swipe at India accusing New Delhi of trying to “find a pretext for a false flag operation targeting Pakistan” - it was seen to be a response to reports of Pakistan’s attempt to infiltrate terrorists - Khan underlined the claim that Kashmir’s troubles were home-grown.“The Indigenous Kashmiri resistance against Indian Occupation is a direct consequence of India’s oppression & brutalisation of Kashmiris,” he tweeted.Khan had last week brought in former director general of the Pak military’s Inter-Services Public Relations Lt Gen (retired) Asim Saleem Bajwa as his new special assistant to lead his media team.Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson followed up on Imran Khan’s tweet on Thursday with a detailed statement that elaborated Khan’s point.“India must realise that it cannot break the will of the Kashmiri people and suppress their indigenous resistance movement through the use of force... We also categorically reject, once again, the baseless Indian allegations of infiltration,” spokesperson Aisha Farooqui said.It was the second time this week that she was using the phrase.The first was two days after the TRF claimed to be involved in the May 3 Handwara encounter involving the Lashkar commander, Haider. “Attributing this indigenous Kashmiri resistance to any alleged “infiltration” is a travesty,” she had tweeted on May 5.How Lashkar hand-holds TRF in KashmirBack in Kashmir, intelligence officials said the Lashkar-e-Taiba’s old guard was focussing on getting TRF new recruits from the Kashmir valley.In north Kashmir, officials said LeT terrorists such as Mehrajdduin Halwal were consolidating the TRF’s base on the ground. Its social media handles, which are being fed content traced back to locations in Pakistan, have been campaigning aggressively. The earliest version of its social media handles too had been traced to internet protocol addresses in Pakistan.“We have now got this account on social media platform Telegram blocked,” Kashmir Police chief Vijay Kumar said, suggesting this is why the group had not put out any updates about the encounter that led to the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen’s boss in Kashmir Riyaz Naikoo.For now, security officials expect the TRF to carry out grenade attacks, mostly using its overground workers or fresh recruits rather than risk its trained hands. A grenade attack, lobbed in Srinagar’s Hari Singh High Street in October last year was one of its first terror attacks. The group had, however, lost dozens of grenades when some of its overground workers ferrying AK-47 and grenades were caught by the police in March and are believed to be looking to replenish their supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-launches-terror-s-new-face-in-kashmir-imran-khan-follows-up-on-twitter/story-vDmvByzkeowrW8OKruhS3M.html

But, even before they could wake up, a deadly gas leaked from a chemical factory nearby and jolted them out of their sleep.The pre-dawn disaster - it struck at 2.30 am - led to the death of 11 people and left more than 1,000 struggling for breath.Video from news agency ANI showed emergency workers in the area rushing to help victims, some of whom appeared to be listless and disoriented.A number of victims lay unconscious streetside, as some volunteers fanned them and others rushed to carry them into ambulances. The scene evoked memories of the 1984 Bhopal Gas Tragedy that left at least 4,000 people dead and another 500,000 injured when methyl isocyanate leaked from a Union Carbide pesticide plant in the Madhya Pradesh capital.“The leak was so intense that it turned into a fog and only around 9.30 am could we understand what exactly it was as the thick fog that formed in the area cleared,” news agency PTI quoted district collector V Vinay Chand as saying.The gas spread to villages over a five kilometre radius.As rescuers rushed to take people to the hospital, many others were seen gasping for breath as they tried to flee, disoriented by the vapours. “No one could breathe. I couldn’t see anything for some time,” Vijay Raju, a local resident, said by phone. “For a moment, I thought I would die.”Narendra, another villager, said he sensed something was wrong after he woke up in the middle of the night. “Around 2.30 am, I woke up as my skin was itching. I opened my eyes but felt a burning sensation. I sensed some danger and woke up my family,” he said.State authorities and officials from LG Polymers said they were investigating what caused the leak but a preliminary situation report by district officials said the trigger was a malfunction in equipment, which caused the temperature to rise and the organic compound styrene - normally a liquid - to vaporise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-turned-into-a-fog-locals-recount-vizag-gas-leak-in-which-11-were-killed/story-EV1NfQCJwvrMIR4KwpV1oJ.html

08-05-2020||India||Govt asks factories to exercise caution after gas leak at Visakhapatnam plant||Union chemicals and fertilisers minister D V Sadananda Gowda on Thursday urged all public and private chemical makers to exercise caution and care while reopening their plants that suspended operations due to the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19.Union environment ministry and state pollution control boards issued separate directives to all companies to take precautions while restarting.The announcements came on a day when three separate accidents killed 11 and left several injured in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh.All the fatalities were in Visakhapatnam, where a styrene gas leak at a polymer plant forced the evacuation of thousands of people in the 3-kilometre radius.In Tamil Nadu, a boiler at an NLC India thermal power plant in Cuddalore exploded, causing brief blaze. The incident left two workers injured, an NLC official said. “Due to pressure, there was an explosion in the boiler and it led to a flash fire injuring six workers and two technicians.”In the third incident, seven workers fell ill — three of them seriously — after inhaling poisonous gas at Shakti Paper Mill in Chhattisgarh’s Raigarh, police said. The incident occurred when the victims were cleaning a recycling chamber late on Wednesday, said SP Santosh Singh.The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) recommended better operational guidelines be given to the plants. “The (Visakhapatnam) leakage has happened due to irregular maintenance of storage tanks during the lockdown.Styrene must be kept at a temperature below 17C however since the plant was under partial shutdown the maintenance activities were irregular. Another industry disaster was reported at a Paper mill in Chhattisgarh -- when gas leaks affected the workers who were housekeeping at the units. The third incident was at Neyveli thermal power station. Two boilers of 210 MW capacity blasted... While these boiler units were in running condition, poor maintenance practices due to less manpower in the plant is suspected a reason for the blast. It is clear industries are in haste to restart operation post lockdown...” said Nivit K Yadav, industries researcher, CSE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-asks-factories-to-exercise-caution-after-gas-leak-at-visakhapatnam-plant/story-SbVJAGgmb8Ye7nPUFn3vmM.html

08-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||There are four animals that have become relevant in the context of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). This column is about them.It was only in 2013, after a decade of looking for the source of the Sars-CoV (or Sars-CoV-1) virus that causes the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, that scientists found the natural host of the virus, horseshoe bats — specifically, horseshoe bats in a cave outside a large city in China’s Yunnan province. Somehow, the virus had made the jump from the bats, to civets in Guangdong, and from them to humans (the Chinese eat civet meat and the first people to be infected were wildlife traders from Guangdong). A fascinating article in Scientific American in March narrated this quest as part of its profile of Shi Zhengli, a virologist in Wuhan. Scientists say the bats may well be the natural host of the virus that causes the coronavirus disease too.Horseshoe bats, then, are the first animals of relevance in the context of Covid-19. That shouldn’t surprise anyone. Research has established that bats are hosts to more zoonoses (pathogens that can cross over to humans, causing an infection) than any other species.Sometimes, the transmission happens directly. Sometimes, it happens through another animal. In the case of Sars, it was the masked palm civet that was the intermediary. In the case of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or Mers, it was a species of camel. In the case of Covid-19, scientists believe the intermediary was the pangolin — specifically, the Malayan Pangolin. India has a species of pangolin too, the Indian Pangolin. Pangolins are widely used in Chinese medicine, so it’s easy to see how Sars-CoV-2 could have jumped from bats to pangolins to humans.The pangolin, then is the second animal of relevance in the context of Covid-19, which, as of Thursday, has infected 3.8 million people, and killed 265,000 (of the 3.8 million, 1.3 million have recovered).The global scale of the pandemic, which has no cure right now, has meant everyone knows the significance of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. This is the vaccine being developed at the University of Oxford. The vaccine hopes to tackle Covid-19 by injecting a weakened adenovirus into which genetic material from Sars-CoV-2 has been inserted — something that should generate an immune response. The adenovirus the scientists at Oxford are using is one that causes cold in chimpanzees, which explains the name of the vaccine (Ch for chimpanzee and Ad for adenovirus). We humans share 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees and bonobos (another ape, and one that belongs to the same genus as chimpanzees).Chimpanzees are the third animal of relevance in the context of Covid-19, especially given that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 remains our best bet yet. There are expectations that it will be available this year itself, and India’s Serum Institute has already started making it — taking a bet that an ongoing clinical trial will work.But chimpanzees aren’t the only potential saviours of the human race. Over the past two days, there has been a lot of focus on llamas, the ungulates with pretty eyelashes. It turns out that they have antibodies that can tackle Covid-19 (the findings of a study on this were published earlier this week on the respected journal, Cell). It also turns out that the antibodies produced by llamas can be merged with antibodies produced by other species, including humans. Indeed, research has shown that all other members of the family llamas belong to, camelidae, produce antibodies with the same property — they are stable at higher temperatures, and lend themselves to genetic engineering because of their small size.The llama, then, is the fourth animal of relevance in the context of the pandemic. And if llamas hold the answer to the virus, they will become as famous as the horses that helped humankind in the fight against diphtheria -- but that’s another story.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-8OgLIJ3cGJa9ZrI77F725M.html

He added India is constantly working to help other countries across the globe and will continue to do the same. Modi said while making every possible effort to save every life, India is also fulfilling its global responsibilities. “Every word and preaching of Buddha reinforces India’s commitment to serve humanity,” he said.He urged people not to give up and continue to face the challenge. Modi said to stop after getting tired cannot be a solution to any problem as people have to fight together to defeat the pandemic.He referred to frontline workers toiling daily and said their resilience needs to be honoured. “During this difficult time, there are several people around us who are working 24 hours to help others by sacrificing their own comforts. Such people deserve honour and appreciation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/teachings-of-buddha-more-relevant-in-covid-19-crisis-says-pm-modi/story-0yEN91j0ZigWQ1Zz6QfPxO.html

The cases have been withdrawn following the necessary procedure, Pathak said, adding that since this was an important issue the opinion of the Attorney General was also taken. Nirwal had also made a recommendation in this regard, he said.Most of the cases have been withdrawn after proper examination, he said, adding that they were found to be politically motivated to harass people. At least 62 persons died and a large number of people lost their homes in the riots in September 2013. A total of 503 cases were lodged against around 1,455 persons in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli by the then SP government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-cancels-cases-against-28-in-2013-muzaffarnagar-riot/story-apqtGsdhwonxUnG5N6oBSM.html

Both the BSF personnel died this week in Delhi. While the BSF reported 41 new cases on Thursday, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) reported 21 fresh infections, CISF 10, and the Sashastra Seema Bal five. Till Wednesday, the tally of Covid-19 cases in the paramilitary forces was around 400, according to government data.BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bhardwaj said in a statement that the first jawan was critically ill patient, and died after he contracted the infection while at a super-speciality hospital for treatment. The second jawan died at Safdarjung hospital on May 4. His Covid-19 test was done after his death, prior to the post-mortem examination. The result confirming the infection came only on Wednesday. The BSF’s fresh 41 new infections have taken the force’s Covid-19 tally to 193 across the country.“Prahari pariwar (the BSF family) is grief-stricken with deaths of two personnel during this pandemic,” a BSF statement said. “Braving the challenges of securing frontiers, working with civil administration and while shouldering other essential responsibilities, 41 new Covid-19 positive cases have been reported since yesterday. Most of these BSF personnel have been aiding civil police in duties during this critical phase of the Covid-19 pandemic,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-deaths-in-bsf-forces-case-count-nears-500/story-RKlFvAL03Pcj9eMCBdSD3H.html

The national carrier will provide health care facilities in 85 of the 215 stations. In the rest of the 130 stations, states will run the operations only if they are able to provide staff and essential medicines, the ministry said.According to the health ministry guidelines, states will request the railways for the deployment of such coaches if the need arises. After allocation by the railways, coaches will be placed at the required station with necessary infrastructure. The concerned district collector/magistrate or a nodal officer appointed by the government will be handed over the responsibility.Catering arrangements shall be done by the Indian Railways’ catering arm, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), the guidelines said. Watering, electricity as well as repairs required shall be taken care of by the railways. The Railway Protection Force will ensure security to the coaches, patients and staff working there.The railways will designate state-wise nodal officers for allocation of trains and for coordinating with the respective state governments.“As far as possible, wherever cases are admitted in the COVID Care Centre coach, preferably individual cabin should be assigned for each case. Should the situation warrant, up to a maximum of two confirmed patients can be assigned in individual cabin,” the guidelines said.Additionally, the national carrier will deploy more than 2,500 doctors and 35,000 paramedic staff to combat Covid-19. Doctors and paramedics are being recruited on a temporary basis by various zones of the railways, the guidelines said. Around 5,000 beds in 17 dedicated hospitals and 33 hospital blocks in railway hospitals have been identified for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-231-rly-coaches-to-be-used-as-isolation-wards-at-215-stations/story-jpUjLPyw8uRLZKPjhCx4kI.html

Ahmedabad accounted for more than half of the cases--4,991-- and Surat 799. Of the 425 deaths, 321 have been reported from Ahmedabad and 37 from Surat.Gujarat was among the states where the Centre last month deputed interministerial teams to probe perceived lapses in efforts to control Covid-19 and violations of lockdown regulations.Gujarat police chief Shivanand Jha said the paramilitary forces will monitor the containment areas in Ahmedabad and Surat as the rate of transmission of the virus is higher there. “A special reserve force has been assigned to Gujarat for the strict implementation of lockdown as per chief minister Vijay Rupani’s request to the Centre,” he said. He added all shops except pharmacies and dairies will remain shut in the state until May 15.Jha said the paramilitary forces were deployed to curb the movement of people. He added the lockdown will be stricter in the containment areas.“We have issued orders for continuous patrolling to ensure no one violates the lockdown. ...in such areas, only certain roads will be open, and only authorised persons will be allowed to move. Legal actions will be taken against those stepping out without permissions and their vehicles will be impounded. If shops other than those selling medicines and milk are found to be open, their owners will be arrested and strict action will be taken,” Jha said.The state government has barred all movement from 7 pm to 7 am and ordered the closure of roads and bridges for the purpose. The state police have been instructed to increase checking while the paramilitary, civil defense, home guard, and all other forces were on high alert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forces-carry-out-flag-marches-in-guj-to-enforce-curbs/story-5CRMiHnOyqMatiUMUaom6M.html
08-05-2020||India||12 DTH channels catering to all classes in the offing||The Union human resources development (HRD) ministry is planning to start 12 direct-to-home (DTH) television channels, each catering to students from one academic year, to serve as virtual classrooms at a time when schools are shut due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and there are questions if the online learning might leave behind those with slow or limited connectivity.Two senior government officials familiar with the matter said that the ministry sees this as a way to bridge the digital divide for students from Classes 1 to 12.“The ministry is pursuing a ‘one class, one channel’ plan. The department of school education and literacy may anchor these 12 channels with appropriate content for every class. The expertise of agencies such as the NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) and CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) may be used to develop content and run these channels,” said the official who asked not to be named.While several schools have started online classes, there have been connectivity concerns, and concerns over the amount of additional screen time children will end up being exposed to.“Internet cannot reach everyone. Therefore, the HRD ministry is exploring radio and television as well. One of the major initiatives is to start 12 DTH channels, each dedicated to one class, from Standard 1 to 12. Appropriate subject-relared content, in different languages, will be beamed to homes. These channels will be free,” said a second official on condition of anonymity.Some institutions have been using DTH to disseminate education, and it is these existing Swayam Prabha channels which will be repackaged, the official added.A third official said that a DTH channel catering to higher education sector is also on the cards, and may be launched in consultation with the All India Council for Higher Education (AICTE).Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi did a review of the education sector, and his focus was on leveraging technology to ensure that even those in the remotest parts are reached, said the official cited above. The HRD ministry has been working on an e-Vidya plan, according to the officials.In an interview to HT last month, Union HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ said that to address the digital divide, his ministry had tied up with Information & Broadcasting ministry to air Swayam Prabha channels on their DTH platform, Tata Sky, and Airtel DTH. Earlier, these Swayam channels were be available on DD-DTH, Dish TV, and Jio TV App. “Now a student anywhere in India can request the DTH service provider for these channels without any extra cost as these are free-to-air channels. Swayam Prabha is a group of 32 DTH channels providing high quality educational curriculum based course contents covering diverse disciplines,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-dth-channels-catering-to-all-classes-in-the-offing/story-nZlEDi8EPe0phmvmOoHWNO.html
08-05-2020||India||New J&K terror outfit run by LeT brass: Intel||The Resistance Front (TRF), a new terror group that has taken responsibility for major attacks and gunfights in Jammu & Kashmir over the past few weeks, is controlled by three top handlers of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in Pakistan, according to an intelligence report submitted to national security planners in New Delhi.The idea behind TRF is to give terror in Kashmir an indigenous face, while also warding off international pressure on Pakistan, particularly from anti-terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) that is keeping a close watch on Islamabad’s activities, the report added.Security officials aware of the matter said that TRF was launched late last year after Parliament nullified Jammu & Kashmir’s special status on August 5, and divided the state into two centrally administered Union territories — Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir.Attempts to put an India label on terror activities, one of the security officials cited above said, are reflected in the names Pakistani’s spy agency Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) has picked for new groups -- such as TRF or the low-key JK Pir Panjal Peace Forum. These names don’t have a religious label, but suggest that they are India-bred, the official said on condition of anonymity.The intelligence report prepared by Indian security officials on TRF said Lashkar leaders formed the core of the group. At this point, it said, efforts appeared to be concentrated on projecting TRF as a formidable force to attract local recruits.“TRF is being controlled from Pakistan by top three Lashkar handlers: Sajad Jatt for South Kashmir, Khalid for Central Kashmir and Hanzala Adnan for North Kashmir,” said the report accessed by HT.TRF’s social media managers in Pakistan claimed responsibility after five terrorists and an equal number of army soldiers were killed in the Keran sector early April.The group also claimed responsibility for the gunfight in north Kashmir’s Handwara town that killed five security men, including the commanding officer of a Rashtriya Rifles battalion and a Major, over the weekend. One of the two terrorists killed in the operation was later identified as Lashkar commander Haider, a Pakistani national. The other person was a local terrorist, a resident of Handwara.In Twitter posts on Wednesday, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan accused India of trying to “find a pretext for a false flag operation” targeting his country even as he put emphasis on what he called indigenous “Kashmiri resistance” in the region. His tweets were seen by security experts as a response to reports of Pakistan’s attempt to send terrorists into India.Last week, Khan brought in Lt Gen (retired) Asim Saleem Bajwa, a former director general of the Pakistani military’s inter-services public relations, as his new special assistant.Indian intelligence officials said the LeT’s old guard was focusing on getting TRF new recruits from the Kashmir Valley.In north Kashmir, they added, LeT terrorists such as Mehrajdduin Halwal are consolidating TRF’s base. Also, the group’s social media handles, which feature content traced back to locations in Pakistan, have been campaigning aggressively. The earliest version of its social media handles has been traced to internet protocol addresses in Pakistan.For now, security officials expect TRF to carry out grenade attacks, mostly using its overground workers or fresh recruits rather than risking its trained hands. A grenade lobbed in Srinagar’s Hari Singh High Street in October last year was one of its first attacks, they said. The group, however, lost dozens of grenades when the police caught some of its overground workers ferrying arms and ammunition in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-j-k-terror-outfit-run-by-let-brass-intel/story-wLZ5ACFQJMHVa8kt7weTPO.html
08-05-2020||India||2 warships sent to Maldives to bring back stranded Indians||The first phase of an operation by the navy to bring back Indians stranded overseas will begin on Friday after two warships dispatched to the Maldives reach the island nation late in the night.The navy said on Thursday that INS Jalashwa had reached the shores of Maldives and phase one of the operation called ‘Samudra Setu’ will commence on Friday.The navy’s solitary landing platform dock , the INS Jalashwa, (formerly known as USS Trenton) was bought from the United States 13 years ago. The second ship, INS Magar, is expected to arrive in the Maldives later on Thursday night.Indians being brought from Male to Kochi on INS Jalashwa will have to pay $40 for the transportation as “evacuation services charge,” the High Commission of India in Maldives said on Thursday. Former navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash told Hindustan Times that such a charge was being imposed for the first time. “This has never happened before,” he said.The high commission said on Twitter that the amount would be collected at the service fee collection counter after completion of the immigration process at Velana International Airport in the Maldives. “If this is humanitarian assistance, why are people being charged,” said two senior retired navy officers asking not to be named.The evacuated personnel will be disembarked in Kochi and handed over the respective agencies of various states. The navy said the ‘Samudra Setu’ is being carried out with the cooperation of various central ministries and state governments. All people will be given basic amenities and medical care during the voyage.The navy has kept two ships on standby for evacuation from the Gulf --- INS Shardul and INS Airavat.The navy on Tuesday dispatched two amphibious warships to Male to evacuate Indians stranded in the Maldives amid the swift spread of coronavirus disease globally. The navy is bringing back Indian nationals stuck overseas under operation Samudra Setu and is expected to help around 1,000 people.Indian warships have carried out large-scale evacuations in the past.Operation Sukoon was launched by navy to evacuate Indian, Sri Lankan and Nepalese nationals, as well as Lebanese nationals with Indian spouses, from the conflict zone during the 2006 Lebanon War. The task force consisted of INS Mumbai, INS Brahmaputra, INS Betwa and fleet tanker INS Shakti. A total of 2,280 people including 1,764 Indians were evacuated.In 2015, the navy carried out a major evacuation from Yemen under Operation Raahat. Indian ships Sumitra, Mumbai, Tarkash were among the vessels that took part in the operation. It resulted in the evacuation of 3,074 people from Yemen, including 1,291 foreign nationals||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-warships-sent-to-maldives-to-bring-back-stranded-indians/story-QMeLbfmr8MXULhN3VJD8cI.html
08-05-2020||India||Llama antibodies hold clue to Covid-19 treatment||Winter, a four-year-old chocolate brown female llama in a Belgian farm, may hold clues to mitigating the Covid-19 crisis, according to scientists.Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin linked two copies of a special kind of antibody produced by llamas to create a new antibody that binds to a key protein on Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease. Initial test results to be published in the journal Cell on May 28 indicate that this antibody blocks viruses that display the spike protein - including Sars-CoV-2 - from entering and infecting cells. The inspiration to do this research came from a study conducted on Winter by the same team in 2016.Back then, when Winter was nine months old, researchers were studying two earlier coronaviruses: Sars-CoV-1 (which caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003), and Mers-CoV (which caused the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in 2012). Winter was injected with spike proteins from those viruses over six weeks. Researchers then collected a blood sample and isolated antibodies that bound to each version of the spike protein. One of them showed promise in stopping the virus from infecting cells.“That was exciting to me because I’d been working on this for years. But there wasn’t a big need for a coronavirus treatment then. This was just basic research. Now, this can potentially have some translational implications too,” said Daniel Wrapp, a graduate student in McLellan Lab and co-first author of the paper in a statement published on University of Austin website.“This is one of the first antibodies known to neutralise Sars-CoV-2,” said Jason McLellan, associate professor of molecular biosciences at UT Austin and co-senior author. The University of Texas team is now preparing to conduct preclinical studies in animals such as hamsters or primates. Unlike vaccines that have to be given in advance to provide protection, antibodies can be given to people who are already sick to reduce severity of disease. They start working immediately, the authors said.When the immune systems of llamas or other camelids detect bacteria and viruses, they produce two types of antibodies: one that is similar to human antibodies, and another so tiny that they’re called nanobodies. Aravind Penmatsa, scientist at Indian Institute of Science has been studying this unique quality, and his group isolated camel antibodies with help from National Research Centre on Camel, Bikaner.“Camels and llamas have a unique antibody structure that lacks the light chain that is conventionally present in other species including humans. Conventional antibodies have both the heavy and light chains and resemble a “Y” shaped molecule. Despite lacking the light chain, camelid antibodies retain the neutralising ability of the large antibodies within a single domain called the VHH or nanobodies. Due to their small size, the camelid or llama antibodies have unique advantages, for instance, ease of production, and greater ability to interact with deep cavities and pockets on target surfaces,” said Penmatsa , responding to the University of Texas study over email.Penmatsa has an ongoing study on the effectiveness of camel antibodies in treating antimicrobial resistance.Camelid antibodies are being studied for their potential in monitoring and treatment of tumors, therapies for inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, drug delivery and passive immunotherapy according to an article in Frontiers journal.But experts warned that it may take a long time before such findings develop into therapy. “It’s still a long way to go. The paper has shown the potential of these antibodies in inhibiting coronavirus from entering mammalian cells. Further pre-clinical experiments are needed in relevant animal models to see if antibodies are stable and neutralise the virus inside animals. Generally pre-clinical studies take years but considering the pandemic challenge this can be done in months to a year,” said Amit Singh, associate professor, Centre for Infectious Disease Research, Indian Institute of Science.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/llama-antibodies-hold-clue-to-covid-19-treatment/story-JI6hw0lySiBFORGkXDfSJN.html
08-05-2020||India||India set to lead post-pandemic baby boom: UN||India will be at the centre of a baby boom triggered by the Covid-19 outbreak, which has prompted lockdowns across the world and confined residents indoors, according to a report by the United Nations. “The pandemic could strain health care capacities for mothers and newborns,” the report by Unicef, released on Thursday, warned.“An estimated 116 million babies will be born under the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic,” Unicef said. This represents a spike for the period assessed. “New mothers and newborns will be greeted by harsh realities.”India, with 20.1 million births, tops the nations with the anticipated highest numbers of births in the nine months since the World Health Organisation (WHO) on March 11 declared the outbreak pandemic, the UN body said. India declared a three-week nationwide lockdown with effect from March 25 that has since been extended twice, until May 17.Following India will be countries such as China (13.5 million births), Nigeria (6.4 million), Pakistan (5 million) and Indonesia (4 million).According to estimates of the United Nations Population Fund, 141 million births were recorded worldwide last year, of which 27.2 were in India. “Covid-19 containment measures can disrupt life-saving health services such as childbirth care, putting millions of pregnant mothers and their babies at great risk,” Unicef’s executive director, Henrietta Fore, said in the global report. Developing countries are especially at risk, she said.The UN body made projections for a 40-week period between March 11 and December 16, 2020, in its estimate based upon the WHO’s March 11 assessment that Covid-19 can be characterised as a pandemic.India has made considerable progress in social indicators, but still lags many countries in indices such as maternal health, access to contraception and immunisation. While India is expected to become the most populous country by 2015, the country’s population is increasing at slower pace than before. The total fertility rate -- that is the average number of children a woman has in her lifetime -- for the country currently stands at 2.2 children for every woman; it was marginally higher, at 2.3, from 2013 to 2016. “The government’s population policy objectives are in alignment with national development goals. There is considerable campaign towards family planning and two-child norm,” an official of Niti Aayog, the government’s policy think tank, said on condition of anonymity.According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), the prevalence rate of anaemia among Indian women has witnessed just a speck of minor improvement from 55% in 2005-06 to 53% in 2015-16.Unicef said most of the countries which will witness a baby boom (including India) had “high neonatal mortality rates” even before the pandemic and “may see these levels increase with Covid-19 conditions”.“That’s very true. Family welfare has got a big knockdown. Access to birth-control measures during the lockdown has been scarce. There is a high possibility of unprotected sex among spouses. Adequate resources must be reserved for a birth boom,” said Dr Sushil Sharma, a public health expert and chairman of the Arthritis Foundation of India.According to Purushottam M Kulkarni of the Jawaharlal Nehru University, data from the NHFS shows that between 2005-06 and 2015-16 (NFHS-4), there has been little improvement in access to contraception, indicating an unmet need for contraception.Unmet need for contraception is measured as the share of women who are fertile and want to postpone their next birth or stop childbearing altogether but don’t have access to contraception.Even wealthier countries are affected by this crisis, the UN body said. “In the US, the sixth highest country in terms of expected number of births, over 3.3 million babies are projected to be born between March 11 and December 16. In New York, authorities are looking into alternative birthing centres as many pregnant women are worried about giving birth in hospitals.”Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, an estimated 2.8 million pregnant women and newborns died every year, or 1 every 11 seconds, mostly of preventable causes, data from WHO show. The UN body called for allocating dedicated resources to lifesaving services and supplies for maternal and child health. India’s maternal mortality rate (MMR) declined from 130 per 100,000 live births in 2014-2016 to 122 in 2015-2018, according to the latest data available with the National Sample Registration System.“We still do badly, despite improvements in several indicators... Better institutional health care for newborns and mothers are even more important now,” said Abishek Jaiswal, a demographer with Allahabad University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-set-to-lead-post-pandemic-baby-boom-un/story-EBThzqy9cPskYpL6L6WLTP.html

The two local militants were buried in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district to avoid crowding and to ensure adherence to social distancing guidelines during the lockdown. It was not clear if Naikoo’s family members were present.The 35-year-old top Hizbul leader and was killed in his village, Gulzarpora Beighpora, after a five-hour gunfight on Wednesday, in what security experts described as a big success for the Indian forces.Strict restrictions imposed in Kashmir after the encounter continued for the second day with mobile internet and prepaid phone services suspended. Stone-pelters, provoked by messages on the social media, have clashed with forces after encounters targeting local militants in the past. Over 16 people were injured in protests that ensued in south Kashmir after Naikoo’s death. Though there were reports that a person died due to his injuries, officials did not confirm any death.Divulging what led to the successful operation, Jammu and Kashmir director general of police Dilbag Singh said the people who made an underground hideout close to the house of Naikoo led security forces to him.“This hideout was close to his house and was inside the wall…the people who had constructed the hideout led us there. We have intruded their overground network,” he said.”He released videos/audios on a number of occasions carrying pro-Pakistan and separatist propaganda and executed a series of attacks on policemen, security forces and civilians,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hizb-commander-naikoo-buried-100km-from-his-hometown-to-avoid-crowding/story-rHHqlp7Q8rbdzuun3cpj6N.html

The incident prompted the Union government to issue an advisory to chemical plants to take extra precautions while restarting their operations from what will be more than a month’s halt due to the nationwide shutdown in place to reduce the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “About 20km from Visakhapatnam, styrene gas, which is toxic and injurious to human health, was leaked. Nearly 1,000 people living around the area may have been impacted and have been evacuated,” said National Disaster Management Authority member Kamal Kishore at a press briefing in New Delhi. Videos and photos from the area showed men, women and children unconscious in the streets, some lying next to fallen motorcycles. The scene evoked memories of the 1984 Bhopal Gas Tragedy that left at least 4,000 people dead and another 500,000 injured when methyl isocyanate leaked from a Union Carbide pesticide plant in the Madhya Pradesh capital.Styrene can affect people’s breathing and brain function, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Randeep Guleria said the briefing, adding: “Some may have trouble breathing and may need a ventilator. We have to monitor their oxygen levels, respiratory rate and in case of a bronchospasm, they may need steroids.”However, the illness is not universally fatal, he added. According to Andhra Pradesh director general of police Gautam Sawang, two of the fatalities were caused when people collapsed while running from the site. The others died because they were exposed to toxic levels of the gas. A chemical disaster response team was dispatched to the area and Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he had spoken to officials of the ministry of home affairs and the NDMA to take stock of the situation. Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has ordered a probe into the matter, Sawang added.According to a preliminary report prepared by district officials, Thursday’s incident was triggered by a malfunction in the refrigeration unit that was meant to keep the styrene at below 20°C. “Styrene monomer is normally in a liquid state and is safe below a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius. But, because of the malfunctioning of the refrigeration unit, the chemical started gasifying,” said district collector V Vinay Chand, quoting the report submitted by the Factories Department, PTI reported.The leak was so intense that it turned into a fog and “only around 9.30am could we understand what exactly it was as the thick fog that formed in the area cleared,” Chand added.LG Chem Ltd, which owns LG Polymers, is South Korea’s largest chemical company and is part of the LG Corp conglomerate. The company said it is cooperating with Indian authorities to help residents and employees.LG polymers produces synthetic materials known as polystyrene and engineering plastic compounds. Styrene is a hydrocarbon that is used as a precursor -- an ingredient -- in the making of these products. “The gas leakage is now under control, but the leaked gas can cause nausea and dizziness, so we are investing every effort to ensure proper treatment is provided swiftly,” LG Chem said in a statement.Experts warned the incident, and two others that took place on Thursday – an explosion in a boiler unit of a factory in Tamil Nadu and a toxic gas leak at a paper mill in Chhattisgarh – underscore the need to reopen industries carefully. In the other two incidents, 14 people were left ill with no fatalities. “Three industrial accidents have happened today coincidentally when factories are reopening after relaxations from Covid-19 lockdown. One of the commonalities among these incidents has been poor operational and maintenance practises during the lockdown and other is shortage of skilled staff for maintenance work. Maintaining power stations or any industries with less staff is a risk and such incidents in this scenario are not surprising,” said Nivit K Yadav, industries researcher at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).“It is clear industries are in haste to restart operation post lockdown which could be detrimental to worker’s safety and safety of the neighbourhood. CSE recommends better operational guidelines be given to the plants which will be restarting post lockdown,” he added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-die-in-vizag-factory-gas-leak-hundreds-evacuated/story-iOeF207wdSKYSSeX7OKbNI.html

Police and fire service personnel rushed to the scene and took out the body of the nun, who had been staying at the convent for more than a year. The exact cause of her death was not immediately known and police said it will be determined only when they get her post-mortem report. Police suspect it to be a case of suicide. “As of now, no foul play is suspected,” said a police officer on the condition of anonymity and added the nun was undergoing training.Police have registered an unnatural death case. A student was found dead in a well at a convent in Kerala’s Kottayam in 1992. It was initially dismissed as a case of suicide before investigators concluded the student had been murdered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nun-found-dead-in-well-at-kerala-convent-police-suicide-suspected/story-RSfof4EuYWJlaaYWJvhWhP.html
08-05-2020||India||Over 9,300 Military Engineer Services posts set to be abolished||Over 9,300 posts in the Military Engineer Services (MES) are set to be abolished as defence minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday approved a proposal made by the army’s Engineer-in-Chief in this regard, the defence ministry said in a statement. The MES is a construction and maintenance agency of the armed forces and has an annual budget of around Rs 13,000 crore.The abolition of the posts is one of the outcomes of the recommendations made by the Lt Gen DB Shekatkar committee report on enhancing the army’s combat potential and trimming its expenditure.“One of the recommendations made by the committee was to restructure the civilian workforce in a manner that the work of MES could be partly done by departmentally employed staff and other works could be outsourced,” said the statement on the abolition of 9,304 posts out of total 13,157 vacancies of the basic and industrial staff of the MES.The ministry said the recommendation to cut the posts was aimed at making the MES an effective organisation, with a leaner workforce well equipped to handle complex issues in an efficient and cost-effective manner.Welcoming the move to abolish the posts, Shekatkar said this was an important step towards the progressive reduction of the workforce in the coming years. “The MES is a World War II concept. It’s a drain on our resources. It’s very important to spend our resources judiciously. There will be no increase in the defence budget for the next two to three years because of the situation created by Covid-19. We have to use our money wisely as our adversaries will not wait for us to build capabilities,” Shekatkar said.The MES is responsible for the design, construction and maintenance of all army, navy and air force infrastructure but experts believe outsourcing these works is a better and cheaper option.The Shekatkar panel made 188 suggestions of which 99 have been accepted by the ministry and others are under consideration.The recommendations relate to several organisations including the MES, Defence Research and Development Organisation, Directorate General of Quality Assurance, Directorate General of Defence Estates, the Ordnance Factory Board and defence accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-9-300-military-engineer-services-posts-set-to-be-abolished/story-BuzJTKmdhdvi9H4t2irAhM.html
08-05-2020||India||Former Punjab top cop booked in 1991 abduction case||Former Punjab police chief Sumedh Singh Saini and seven other ex-policemen have been booked for the alleged enforced disappearance of a junior engineer in 1991.Saini was Chandigarh’s senior police superintendent when Balwant Singh Multani, the junior engineer, was picked up following a terrorist attack on Saini which left four policemen dead.“An FIR [First Information Report] was registered against Saini and others on the complaint of Jalandhar-resident and Multani’s brother Palwinder Singh,” a Punjab police officer said.In the fresh complaint, Palwinder Singh cited Saini’s influence and said they could not get justice because of it.“After retirement of Saini [in June 2018], our family again got some courage to resume our efforts to fight for justice,” Palwinder Singh said in his complaint.The Central Bureau of Investigation initiated a probe against Saini over the disappearance of Multani, who was a resident of Mohali near Chandigarh, in 2007 on Punjab and Haryana high court’s directions. The Supreme Court quashed the probe in 2011 after then Shiromani Akali Dal-led Punjab government challenged the high court order.On Thursday, a Punjab police spokesperson said the apex court had also given the family the liberty to take recourse to fresh proceedings.Saini accused Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh of trying to settle a score with him. “What comments are required when a chief minister joins hands with anti-national elements to settle a personal score for having him booked for corruption?” said Saini.Saini challenged a state vigilance bureau’s closure report in the Ludhiana City Centre scam in 2018 in which Amarinder Singh was an accused. Amarinder Singh termed Saini’s allegations as baseless. “There is no question of political interference and the law will take its own course.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-top-cop-booked-in-1991-abduction-case/story-VkdRYXhcqK0LbdeMLkPBYJ.html
08-05-2020||India||Not every virus mutation is issue of concern, say experts||Has Sars-CoV2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19), mutated to become more deadly and contagious? Researchers around the world have identified dozens of mutations that they said has made the virus more lethal or transmissible, or both, which has fuelled uncertainty about the future, but experts say there is no significant mutation to suggest change in viral behaviour.Researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the US recently caused alarm when they identified 14 mutations, of which “the mutation Spike D614G is of urgent concern; after beginning to spread in Europe in early February, when introduced to new regions it repeatedly and rapidly becomes the dominant form”. The study, published in pre-print server, bioRxiv, on April 29, has not been peer-reviewed.Independent experts say these findings have no clinical significance. All viruses mutate. A virus causes infection by entering the host cell and making copies of itself, which it does by duplicating its genes. Small errors in the duplication become mutations, which usually have no effect on viral behaviour. “It is normal for viruses to change over time and to become more or less transmissible, cause more or less fatalities. The virus causing Covid-19 disease remains relatively stable so far,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, World Health Organization (WHO), South-East Asia region, of which India is apart.Not every mutation creates a new strain, which is used to describe a lineage that is significantly different from earlier viruses. “In my opinion, there is no clear evidence of any different strains of clinical significance. By sequence, one can identify phylogenetic clades, some of which show mutations of possible significance. Until proven by clinical, or, at the very least, experimental studies, one should avoid speaking of strains in the clinical sense of the word,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, Council of Scientific & Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), New Delhi. CSIR-IGIB, along with the National Centre for Disease Control in Delhi, has submitted 53 sequences of Covid-19 genomes to Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), which is the largest submission by any group in India.“All viruses mutate all the time, there’s no significant mutation,” said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist, WHO. Mutations that affect transmissibility, virulence, antigenicity, and resistance to available treatment are the ones that affect how a virus spreads, how deadly it is, its ability to evade the immune system and drugs and vaccines used to treat it.“Once more sequences to be made available from all countries with identified cases, an analysis of the virus that shows these adaptations will inform WHO’s advice to countries,” said Dr Khetrapal Singh.“Mutations in themselves are not a bad thing and there is nothing to suggest SARS-CoV-2 is mutating faster or slower than expected. So far we cannot say whether Sars-CoV-2 is becoming more or less lethal and contagious,” said Professor Francois Balloux, from University College London Genetics Institute, UK, and co-lead author of a study that identified 198 recurring mutations to the virus, in a statement. The study was published in the journal, Infection, Genetics and Evolution on May 6.The viruses without the D mutation? include the one that emerged in Wuhan, China, while viruses with the G mutation? first appeared in February, and, by April, had become dominant strains across most parts of the world. But this could just be because people with the G mutation travelled more, met more people, and took fewer precautions, leading to super spreading.Past studies of coronaviruses that cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers), show that this family of viruses change at one-tenth the speed of influenza viruses, and scientists believe Sars-CoV-2 also has a slow mutation rate.Developing a vaccine against viruses that mutate quickly is a huge challenge. In the case of flu viruses, the vaccine has to be changed every year to protect against the three to four specific strains causing most of the infections.Most work on vaccines and drugs against Sars-Cov-2 target the spike protein to prevent it from entering human cells to cause infection. At least 120 vaccine projects are in various stages of development , of which seven have entered clinical human trials to test the safety and efficacy of the vaccine on healthy volunteers, according to the WHO. Another 82 are in the pre-clinical animal trial phases, and at least two have been found to protect monkeys from infection. “We need to develop drugs and vaccines that cannot be easily evaded by the virus,” said Professor Balloux.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-every-virus-mutation-is-issue-of-concern-say-experts/story-P5Ta4Av0aHGG7Qo6uaS1pO.html
08-05-2020||India||India kicks off op to fly back citizens, 363 evacuees from UAE land in Kerala||Thirty nine pregnant women were among the 363 people who returned to India from the United Arab Emirates on Thursday night via two Air India Express flights that formed the first leg of a massive repatriation programme involving 12 countries and 15,000 passengers.The first flight of the ‘Mission ‘Vande Bharat’ carrying 181 people from Abu Dhabi landed in Kochi around 10pm on Thursday. The second flight with 182 passengers from Dubai landed in Kozhikkode roughly 20 minutes later.As the passengers – many of them aged, disabled or children – disembarked from the flight, many were seen wiping tears.“I am delighted to be in my place. Thank God, I will with my parents for my first delivery. Really grateful to all,” said a pregnant woman on the Kochi flight who refused to share her name.Shah Jahan, who boarded the flight from Abu Dhabi, said he decided to return to India as he had lost his job. “ I am happy to be a part of the first evacuation flight,” he said.The state government has set up quarantine and isolation facilities near the international airports and also arranged vacant flats, houses and houseboats to accommodate the passengers.But as the flight carried many vulnerable and old people, the authorities decided to quarantine them in their respective districts. Once they came out of the airport, they were taken to their respective native districts in special buses and vehicles. “We are going by the government directive,” said Ernakulam collector S Suhas.Passengers started arriving at Abu Dhabi and Dubai airports as early as 9.30am on Thursday. Some of the passengers were carrying the Tricolour.Indian ambassador Pavan Kapoor was seen inquiring about the procedure from some of the passengers undergoing medical screening at the Abu Dhabi airport.“Kudos to all the passengers for waiting patiently for their turn for medical screening and many thanks to all the frontline health workers and airport staff for extending full support,” the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi tweeted. “Vanda Bharat Mission, the world’s biggest repatriation exercise starts today. More than 350 Indian from UAE will be flying back. Thanks to all,” Kapoor said.“All of them have cleared the tests,” Consul General of India in Dubai, Vipul, was quoted as saying by the Gulf News.He said the criteria of passengers’ selection included medical cases, loss of jobs, pregnant women and senior citizens. Those with complications and financial issues were also picked.In the first week of the massive operation, 64 flights will bring 15,000 Indian citizens home from 12 countries. All those who travel back will have to pay for their tickets, undergo strict screening processes, download the Aarogya Setu app, and go into institutional quarantine after landing.The first phase runs from May 7 to May 13 and involves the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Bangladesh, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, United Kingdom and United States. All international passengers will be charged for the journey and fares from Gulf countries to Kerala range from Rs 15,000 to Rs 16,000. Rescue flights from London will cost Rs 50,000 while flights from the United States have been priced at Rs 1,00,000.At least 300,000 people have people have registered to come back in West Asia alone but the authorities are focusing only on “compelling cases”.A set of standard operating procedures by the Union home ministry said that priority will be given to “asymptomatic” migrant labourers/workers abroad who have been laid off, short term visa holders faced with expiry (of visas), persons with medical emergency, pregnant women, the elderly, students, and those required to return to India due to the death of a family member.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/363-evacuees-from-uae-land-in-kerala/story-mBFknR5e8rbPVuzvkz4wRM.html
08-05-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccine development sees unparalleled progress||US President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign took off with him telling potential voters that a coronavirus vaccine will be ready by the end of 2020, even as European leaders pledged to raise US $8.3 billion to “kickstart an unprecedented global co-operation” between scientists, industry, governments and philanthropies for vaccine development.Global efforts to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have progressed at an unprecedented pace aiming to stop the spread of the pandemic, which has infected 3.5 million people, killed 250,000 and wrecked global economies within four months.At least 120 vaccine projects are in various stages of development since China shared the genetic sequence of Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, with the World Health Organization (WHO) on January, 12, 2020. Of these, seven have entered human trials to test the safety and efficacy of the vaccine on healthy volunteers, according to WHO. Another 82 are in pre-clinical animal trial phases, and at least two have been found to protect monkeys from infection. Also Watch: Covid-19: India begins testing possible cure on patients at PGI Chandigarh Johnson & Johnson, which was singled out by Trump as an example of vaccine success, said last month that it will be ready to produce 600 million to 900 million doses of its potential vaccine by April 2021 if human trials set to begin in September go as planned. Pfizer and the German company, BioNTech, said if their human trials are successful, they can produce millions of doses by the end of 2020. Vaccine development, on average, takes 10.71 years from the preclinical phase, and has a market entry probability of 6%, according to a study in peer reviewed journal, PLOS One. The development includes at least three human trials to test their safety, dosage and the strength and duration of the protection they offer, followed by production, licensure, deployment of vaccines and plans for post-marketing surveillance.“With Covid-19, the goal is to develop, test and manufacture a vaccine on a scale of hundreds of millions of doses within 12 to 18 months. Since the vaccine will be needed very quickly, an unprecedented approach has been taken by the companies. Since approvals are expected for an emergency use of the vaccine, they will start mass manufacturing as soon as they finish phase 2 trials and move to phase 3, and, in doing so, risk the failure of phase 3. In such cases, consortiums and countries fund for risk reduction and provide market commitments,” said Dr N K Ganguly, former director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Pune-based Serum Institute of India started work 10 days ago on manufacturing in parallel to the human safety trials, the Oxford experimental vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, at its own risk. “SII plans to begin manufacturing the ChAdOx1 vaccine in anticipation of the clinical trials in the UK succeeding by September/October. SII will initiate the manufacture at its own risk to jump-start manufacturing and have enough doses available, if the clinical trials work,” said SII CEO, Adar Poonawalla in a statement.  WHO last week organised a meeting of vaccine manufacturers and national regulatory authorities in its South-East Asia Region, of which India, Indonesia and Thailand are a part. The three countries are among the world’s largest vaccine manufacturers.“The manufacturing capacity that exists in the region is of the quality and scale required to produce and roll out a Covid-19 vaccine globally. This region is a vaccine manufacturing powerhouse, and it must now also play a lead role in overcoming the ongoing pandemic,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia. At the virtual meeting, leading manufacturers from India, Indonesia and Thailand discussed timelines and production capacity, while regulatory bodies discussed how to fast-track processes to make large scale production and deployment of Covid-19 vaccines possible by the end of the year. “The way this pandemic is progressing, we are left with no choice but to have an emergency use vaccine within eight months, we can’t afford to wait for years. In the case of Covid-19, we already have some experience from SARS CoV-1 and MERS platforms, which have been used previously for delivering other vaccines. The same is the case with proven adjuvants [a substance which increases the body’s immune response to an antigen], which could be used. So considering the fact that we are not starting from scratch, it is in the realm of possibility,” said Dr Ganguly.Last month, WHO launched the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, which brings together key global health actors, private sector partners and other stakeholders to accelerate the development and production of Covid-19 essential health technologies, including vaccines, and to help guarantee equitable access. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recently said it’s “within the realm of possibility” to have a vaccine widely available by January, but only if drug companies are willing to assume the risk of beginning to ramp up production of the vaccine before it is fully tested and approved.Vaccines have led to the global eradication of small pox, and wiped out polio from most countries of the world, except Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria, where it remains endemic. Vaccines for diseases such as HIV, however, remain elusive after two decades of effort.“All countries are now preparing to safely transition towards a new normal in which social and economic life can function amid low or no Covid-19 transmission. No country is safe until we all are safe, for which an effective vaccine that is accessible to all is needed,” said Dr Khetrapal Singh.Coronavirus vaccines: types and methodsCovid-19 vaccines use a wide variety of platforms and techniques to train the immune system to identify the Sars-CoV-2 virus and block or destroy it before it infects the body.Most vaccines feed immune cells, a signature of the unique spike protein on the surface of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which it uses to enter human cells to cause infection.An effective vaccine is one that generates neutralising antibodies, which store the genetic blueprint of the virus to give long-lasting protection.At least eight vaccine types that rely on different viruses or viral parts are being developed.Virus vaccinesAt least seven teams are developing vaccines using the Sars-CoV-2 virus in a weakened or inactivated form, such as those against measles and polio. Sinovac Biotech in Beijing is testing an inactivated form of Sars-CoV-2 in humans.Weakened virus: A virus is conventionally weakened for a vaccine by being passed through animal or human cells until it picks up mutations that make it less able to cause disease. Codagenix in New York is working with Pune-based Serum Institute of India to weaken SARS-CoV-2 by altering its genetic code so that viral proteins are produced less efficiently.Inactivated virus: The virus is made uninfectious using chemicals, such as formaldehyde, or heat.Nucleic-acid vaccinesAround 20 projects are using coronavirus genetic material (DNA or RNA) to prompt an immune response. The nucleic acid is inserted into human cells, which then churn out copies of the virus protein. Most coronavirus vaccines encode the virus’s spike protein.RNA- and DNA-based vaccines are safe and easy to develop: to produce them involves making genetic material only, not the virus. But they are unproven: no licensed vaccines use this technologyViral-vector vaccinesA weakened virus, such as measles or adenovirus, is genetically engineered to produce coronavirus proteins in the body without causing disease. There are two types of weakened viruses, those that can still replicate within cells, and those that cannot, because key genes have been disabled.Replicating viral vector (such as weakened measles): The newly-approved Ebola vaccine is an example of a viral-vector vaccine that replicates within cells to provoke a strong immune response. The vaccine is safe but existing immunity to the vector could blunt the vaccine’s effectiveness.Non-replicating viral vector (such as adenovirus): No licensed vaccines use this method, but they have a long history in gene therapy. Booster shots can be needed to induce long-lasting immunity. US-based pharma major, Johnson & Johnson, and Oxford University are using this approach.Protein-based vaccinesCoronavirus proteins, of fragments of proteins or protein shells, that mimic the coronavirus’s outer coat, are injected directly into the body.Protein subunits: Twenty-eight teams are working on vaccines with viral protein subunits, with most of them focusing on the virus’s spike protein or a key part of it called the receptor binding domain. Similar vaccines against the Sars virus protected monkeys against infection, but they haven’t been tested in people. To work, these vaccines might require adjuvants, or immune-stimulating molecules delivered alongside the vaccine, as well as multiple doses.Virus-like particles: Empty virus shells mimic the coronavirus structure, but aren’t infectious because they lack genetic material. Five teams are working on ‘virus-like particle’ vaccines, which can trigger a strong immune response, but can be difficult to manufacture.Source: Nature||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccine-development-sees-unparalleled-progress/story-PtAQIKRHB9omEFWbdUfJKI.html
08-05-2020||India||Dissent brews in Delhi Gymkhana over plan to counter govt takeover||The Delhi Gymkhana Club is facing dissent within its own governing body over the strategy to counter a petition filed in the National Company Law Tribunal by the government to take over the club’s management on grounds of financial irregularities and promoting nepotism.Three members of the governing body have lodged their dissent over “exorbitant legal fees” in writing with president,DR Soni ,a retired lieutenant general, people with knowledge of the information said.They have also flagged as “unwise strategy” the Club’s response to the petition. The three-members are former Indian Police Service officer Parvez Hayat, committee member Pooja Singh and Indian Statistical Services officer Ganga Kumar. Hayat and Kumar declined to comment on the matter. Singh could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts.The Club had been given till May 8 to file its response to a petition by the ministry of corporate affairs alleging “parivarwaad” (nepotism), financial irregularities, misuse of allocated land and issues related to membership as the primary reasons behind its move to acquire the Delhi Gymkhana Club.Management of the Delhi Gymkhana, said members of the present governing body, has decided to plead no wrongdoing. “They are planning to file a response saying that the case is entirely motivated and has been filed by those who were denied membership of the club,” said a member privy to the developments.According to a former governing body member, the three dissenters had first written to BS Randhawa, a retired admiral, who is in charge of legal affairs at the club, and then to the president, Soni, who was unavailable for comment despite repeated attempts to contact him.“The dissent has been going on from 23rd March when the first notice was sent,” said a second member privy to the developments. “Some feel that the club is not being defended in the right manner. The governing body can take a view that there were some violations of the Articles of Association and ask for three months to take corrective measures and rectify the situation.”One of the mainstays of the government’s petition, filed by north region director Raj Singh, is that the club was arbitrarily granting membership. A white paper published by the Club in October 2014 too had flagged and addressed serious issues relating to membership of the club.The dissent of the three governing body members is being widely circulated on ‘Hamara Gymkhana’, a WhatsApp group for members, said a member of the club.“Tomorrow there can be a serious frauds investigation,” said the second member. “Why do lawyers have to be paid Rs 1.5 crore to fight a case in NCLT?. The three members suggested that the Club hire one lawyer instead of two.”According to the first member, some in the governing body feel they are being left out of crucial decisions.“No one gets time to analyse any of the agenda items,” the first member said. “Most decisions are last-minute. On Thursday, the governing body met to cast a ballot to approve the strategy. They weren’t even given a copy of the final reply.”The second member added that while the governing body members were given a copy of the draft response, no one was told what would be in the final one.“The printouts were handed out during the course of the meeting for a period of two hours,” said the second member. “No one was allowed to take a copy of the response with them.”The two said that the governing body lacked transparency. “If it were truly transparent, it would reflect faithfully in the minutes uploaded on the website, but even those aren’t put out,” said the first member.The second person, however, added that the solution does not lie in the club being taken over by the government. “The answer is not that the central government should take over the club, but rather in fixing the issues that have come up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dissent-in-delhi-gymkhana-governing-body-over-response-to-govt-s-takeover-bid/story-TLNbIg8IK9dAgEQ4CQ5zGL.html
08-05-2020||India||35 years later, Bhopal gas leak failures resurface in Vizag||As I see images of the Vizag gas leak from the LG plant and hear of the deaths and injured people, it is an eerie flashback to the time I visited Bhopal in 1985 a few weeks after the toxic gas leaked from the Union Carbide plant in December 1984. I was shocked to see the number of people sick and dying in the Bhopal hospitals. In both cases, the accident happened at night and the gas plume escaping from the plant affected the nearby community. Both plants were resuming production after a period of downtime, and it is clear that errors occurred in the protocols.As it turned out, the methyl isocyanate gas from the Union Carbide plant was more toxic than the styrene that leaked from the LG plant. However, the 11 deaths so far and hundreds of affected people in hospital indicate that styrene must have escaped in extremely high concentrations and affected the nearby population. Styrene is a chemical used in plastic and rubber manufacturing, and is toxic to the brain and lungs. The permissible exposure level (PEL) mandated by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is 100 ppm (parts per million) for an adult worker for eight hours and the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health level is 700 ppm. This level has been severely exceeded, indicated by the number of deaths and injured.The health effects of styrene on the lung include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, cough, shortness of breath, chemical inflammation of the lung tissues, and possible accumulation of fluid which can lead to death, a condition known as pulmonary edema. Brain effects include a feeling of drunkenness, changes in colour vision, tiredness, confusion, slowed reaction time, concentration and balance problems. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified styrene as a possible carcinogen. There is no known antidote to this toxin so aggressive supportive management and treatment is the need of the hour. The supportive treatment is typically washing skin to remove the chemical, administration of oxygen, and symptomatic treatment.The questions that need to be answered immediately are: How much of the toxin escaped into the environment? What were the emission levels downwind of the plant? Are there other toxins that also escaped? What is the area of spread of the gas? Which neighborhoods are affected, Did the toxin seep into the soil and water? And how many people were at risk of exposure to this toxic gas cloud? Some of these questions can be answered by urgently modelling the gas plume dispersion. Note that the PEL of 100 ppm is for a healthy adult worker but the exposed population in Vizag would certainly comprise children, pregnant women, older individuals, and people with heart, lung, and other disabilities which would render them more vulnerable to the toxic effects of styrene. In addition, in people with Covid-19 infection, the inflammatory effects of styrene could be far worse. Concurrent with the immediate treatment, a search must be made for the population potentially exposed to styrene, so that they may be monitored in the immediate aftermath, as well as in the medium and long term.Thirty six years after the Bhopal disaster, it is distressing to see accidents from hazardous industries. The fields of occupational and environmental medicine, toxicology, and epidemiology which study and prevent industrial accidents have still not been developed adequately to cater for the amount of industrial development that has occurred in India. After the Bhopal disaster, I was frustrated that this field was not available in India and I had to go overseas to study these subjects. In 2020, I’m not sure very much has changed.

08-05-2020||India||Panic as Vizag gas leak leaves villagers gasping for air||Around 2:30 am on Thursday morning, styrene vapours leaked from a plant in Visakhapatnam’s RR Venkatapuram village, spreading as a fog on over several villages in a 5-km radius, where people woke up in panic as they began coughing and their skin itching. The incident at the LG Polymers unit, which produces plastic for industrial use, claimed the lives of at least 11 people with more feared to die as 25 people were in a critical condition, officials said, while adding that close to 1,000 people were affected in all.According to eyewitnesses and photos from the area, dozens of people fell unconscious on the streets, some splayed out while foam trailed from their mouths, while those conscious gasped for breath. “No one could breathe. I couldn’t see anything for some time,” Vijay Raju, a local resident, said by phone, news agency AP reported. “For a moment, I thought I would die.”Hundreds of people fled from the affected areas, some on motorbikes and others carried in open trucks. Some who couldn’t find vehicles raced away barefooted, many with small children slung across their shoulders.At least two people died when they hit their head on the ground as they collapsed from the effects of the toxin while running away, state police chief Gautam Sawang said. Images showed many of the victims who lay on the streets were next to fallen motorcycles. An ambulance driver fainted while steering the vehicle. He stopped and after a vomiting, got back at the wheels to rush the affected people to hospital, local news media reported.“Initially I thought that it was an LPG cylinder leak. However, when we came out we realised it is a leakage from LG polymers factory near our village,” news agency PTI quoted Vinay, who lost his uncle in the incident, as saying.Narendra, another resident of the village, said he saw many people slowly losing their strength and falling unconscious when they tried to take them out of their houses, PTI reported. “We were fast asleep and at around 2.30 am I woke up as my skin was itching. I opened my eyes but felt a burning sensation. I sensed some danger and woke up my other family members. We all came out and I along with my other neighbours and friends started waking up others,” he said.A first year medical student, two girls, aged six and nine, were among the 11 people killed due to the leakage of styrene vapour and related incidents.Vinay said his brother Kannaji fell unconscious after inhaling the gas and also sustained injuries.“He is now undergoing treatment at the NRI hospital here. Doctors told us that his lungs were filled with gas. He is being shifted to the ICU,” Vinay said.In the hour of crisis, several people also turned up to help. Local youth who sensed danger started knocking the doors of other residents and brought them out in the wee hours.The toxic gas also killed cattle, poultry birds, dogs and cats that were seen lying motionless after the white vapours had lifted. Images from social media and local TV channels showed hundreds of chickens in poultry farms in nearby villages were found dead with their bodies turning dark grey due to the effect of gas leakage.Police officers, some wearing gas masks, rushed from house to house and evacuated about 2,000 people. South Korea on Thursday expressed shock and grief over the incident.“I am shocked and saddened by the news of the accident that occurred at the LG Polymers Plant in Venkatapuram that caused loss of valuable lives and many falling ill,” South Korean Ambassador Shin Bong-kil said.“This was a highly unfortunate incident and our deepest condolences go out to those affected by this tragic event. We pray for the speedy recovery of those who have been taken ill,” he said in a brief statement.LG Chem Ltd, which is the parent company of LG polymers, is part of the South Korean enterprise LG. The company said it was investigating the accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panic-as-vizag-gas-leak-leaves-villagers-gasping-for-air/story-MxjWvi88PcAj064XOX79PP.html
08-05-2020||India||Congress leader moves Kerala high court over Aarogya Setu app||The central government’s May 1 directive to make the mobile application Aarogya Setu mandatory for all persons working in government and private companies was challenged by a Congress leader in the Kerala high court on Thursday for violating right to privacy and autonomy. The Aarogya Setu collects personal information of an individual without his or her consent and such coercive and forcible extraction of personal information is unheard of in a democratic and republic setup and is the attribute of a dictatorial system, the plea by the general secretary of the Thrissur district Congress Committee, John Daniel alleged.“The petitioner is aggrieved by the order issued by Government of India, which makes the use of the mobile application, Arogya Setu, mandatory for all. The petitioner is aggrieved by the dilution of the concepts of personal autonomy and informed consent effected by virtue of this mandatory imposition”, the plea filed through advocates Sriram Parakkat, KR Sripathi and Anupama Subramanian stated. The central government had launched Aarogya Setu on April 2 as a digital contact-tracing tool and to disseminate information regarding Covid-19. Contact-tracing is the practice of finding potential new infections that an infected person may have caused by coming close to other people.Arogya Setu uses a smartphone’s GPS and Bluetooth features to track contact and location trails. The petitioner’s case was built on the argument that the app is a tracking mobile application which continuously collects data of an individual once it is installed on the mobile phone.The petitioner argued that Aarogya Setu collects the personal information of a registered user including name, phone number, age, sex, profession, countries visited in the last 30 days and whether a person is a smoker or non smoker and his or her medical condition. The May 1 order of the central government also directed state governments to proceed under section 188 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) against anyone who violates lockdown measures including the failure to install the app. Section 188 of the IPC states that any person who disobeys an order given by a public servant can be punished with imprisonment up to 6 months.The plea specifically assailed clause 15 of Annexure 1 of the May 1 order as per which the use of the app was made mandatory for all employees. Clause 15 also states that it shall be the responsibility of the head of the respective organisations to ensure that all employees use the Aarogya Setu app.“Clause 15 mandating the use of the application, Arogya Setu takes away the right of a person to decide and control the use of information pertaining to him. He is forced to give away data to a system which he may or may not approve of, thereby attacking his right of informational autonomy”, the petition said. Autonomy of an individual is central to the right to life as per the 2017 judgment of the Supreme Court in KS Puttaswamy, the petitioner submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-leader-moves-court-over-aarogya-setu-app/story-GOd3dCTqYPrfl0437fCaoI.html
08-05-2020||India||Leg injury doesn’t stop govt worker from carrying out Covid-19 health surveys||Vimla Kumari, a 46-year-old anganwadi worker (AWW) found herself at the centre of much Twitter love on Monday when the District Magistrate of Patna in Bihar, Kumar Ravi, tweeted a photograph of her at work. Clad in a white sari with a red border and wearing a hair net, face mask and gloves, Devi stood with a survey questionnaire in hand. She also sported a cast on her left leg.“This one deserves special mention. ICDS team reports that even after having broken leg AWW Vimla Kumari of Patna Town is working and doing survey in her assigned neighbourhood area on her own. Great level of dedication and commitment towards her work,” Ravi tweeted.Kumari, whose husband died 15 years ago, slipped on a puddle near her home in a slum near Lalit Bhawan towards the end of March. However, this did not dissuade her from conducting a door-to-door survey initiated by the Bihar government in April to check for respiratory distress and influenza-like illness which are associated with symptoms of coronavirus. Using a stick to help her walk, Kumari visited at least 380 houses in the slums near the office of the Bihar Public Service Commission and later, the slum adjacent to Patna Electricity Supply Undertaking — where she resides — from April 16 to May 3.“I realised if I take leave and stay home, people in my area will suffer. Given the adverse circumstances because of the coronavirus pandemic, I decided not to leave my people when they needed me the most,” she said.Kumari, accompanied by an auxiliary nursing midwife, would set out each morning at 8 am and visit at least 25 households everyday till noon. A resident of a one-room shanty, Kumari has three children — a 23-year-old daughter and two sons, aged 22 and 18, who are pursuing their studies. She receives a monthly stipend of Rs 5,650 and her job is to ensure that the government’s social welfare programme reaches every beneficiary.“People in my area trust me. They will not allow any AWW other than me to administer polio drop or any other vaccination to their young children. It is a question of trust. I knew if any other AWW was drafted in my place to survey the area, many people may have been left out of the survey,” she added.“Vimla was adamant to work, despite our willingness to grant her leave,” said Patna district programme officer Bharti Priyamvada, who is with the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), an arm of the social welfare department.“She is a very active, dedicated and responsible worker who has never shied away from any responsibility entrusted upon her. She is not scared of any adversity too. In fact, I had granted her leave, but she did not avail of it,” said Renu Kumari, a child development project officer. The survey, which was earlier confined to only four districts of the state of Bihar has now been extended to cover all 38 districts. Already seven, including Begusarai, Gaya, Nalanda and Siwan, have been completed. “The initial part of the survey, which was to map those who had come from abroad in March, is over. We are now keeping an eye on the migrant workers who are coming into the state capital. We expect to complete the exercise by mid-May,” said the DM.Of the 170 million houses surveyed since April 16, 3,819 people were found to have symptoms of fever with cough and shortage of breath. Bihar has recorded 541 cases of coronavirus with four deaths reported so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leg-injury-doesn-t-stop-govt-worker-from-carrying-out-health-surveys/story-zR89KV5CEexfUAMgwDnznK.html
08-05-2020||India||77 inmates, 26 officials test Covid-19 positive in Mumbai’s Arthur Road prison outbreak||A day after a 45-year-old undertrial tested positive for Covid-19, 77 more inmates and 26 officials at Mumbai’s Arthur Road prison were on Thursday found to have contracted the disease, an Indian Police Service officer said and added the number of infected people was likely to go up. The prison has a capacity to house 800 prisoners but it is housing 2,700. No new prisoners have been sent to this jail since the first week of April because of overcrowding.The undertrial, who is facing charges under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, developed a high fever on April 30. He was taken to Mumbai’s JJ Hospital on May 2 after he suffered a paralytic attack. Samples of 150 people working in and lodged at the prison were taken for testing after the undertrial tested positive. “At least 200 more swabs were taken from the Arthur Road prison on Thursday,” said the officer. Two staff members who stayed at a guest house near the jail and had taken another prisoner to JJ Hospital, too, tested positive.Jail authorities were yet to identify the source of the virus. The officer said the possibility of cleaning staff, sanitisation workers or essential service providers being the source cannot be ruled out.The outbreak of the disease in the prison has led to panic among family members of the inmates. “Relatives of the prisoners have been asking us to file bail pleas. We have to explain to them that the courts are not entertaining any applications for bail in cases where punishment is more than seven years,” said lawyer Prakash Salingekar.Chetan Banne, another lawyer, said he is filing a plea for an accused who has multiple cases registered against him. “The accused is desperate to be out on bail because of the condition at the Arthur Road jail.”Former Supreme Court judge A K Sikri cited the Supreme Court’s order in April on decongesting jails and said it should be followed in letter and spirit. Another retired Supreme Court judge, Madan Lokur, said the undertrial review committee should meet regularly and expedite the applications for release on bail. “The state and district legal services authorities should play a proactive role in ensuring the inmates are released,” said Lokur. He added section 436A of the Criminal Procedure Code provides for the release of inmates, who have served more than half of their sentences.Madhurima Dhanuka of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative said it is a difficult situation and needs to be tackled on a war footing. “Preventive measures need to be taken to stop the further spread of the virus in jails...” (With inputs from KAY Dodhiya & Charul Shah)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/77-inmates-26-officials-test-positive-in-prison-outbreak/story-rpw2ZLnfYOJXtU861hAuoK.html
08-05-2020||India||In shadow of Covid-19 crisis, Agra stares at long road to recovery||It was the perfect photo opportunity. Agra rolled out the red carpet for US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for their visit to the Taj Mahal Febuary 24. The visit went off well and the Taj city had, once again, made its mark as an international host. The euphoria didn’t last long. On March 2, five members of an Agra-based family tested positive for the coronavirus disease, causing the cancellation of public gatherings, and fear of the infection spreading marred Holi on March 9. Yet, March ended with only 12 Covid-19 cases in Agra, eight of whom recovered and were discharged from hospital.Nevertheless, all was not well. The Taj Mahal, the jewel in Agra’s crown, was closed to the public on March 17 and it has remained shut ever since.“The 1971 India-Pakistan war was the last time the Taj Mahal was closed for a long duration. Back then, it was off-limits for the public for about a fortnight. A black cloth covered the marble monument to save it from enemy planes. The foundation of Agra’s economy rests on tourism centred around the Taj Mahal. This time, the monument has remained closed for about a month-and-a-half. There is no possibility of it reopening in the near future,” says Rajeev Saxena, vice- president, Tourism Guild of Agra.“Nearly seven to eight million tourists visit the Taj Mahal every year. The tourism business of Agra is estimated to be around Rs 1,500 crore annually. The local hotel industry’s share is Rs 700 crore to Rs 800 crore. About four to five lakh (400,000-500,000) residents of Agra are directly or indirectly linked to tourism,” says Saxena.Agra is now in the red zone. It has reported over 500 Covid-19 cases so far and ranks 11th nationwide.“It will be a long battle for Agra. Much depends on when surface transport resumes plying. The hospitality business cannot thrive with strict social distancing norms. Even when they reopen, hotels will have to reduce their guest in-take but they will have to keep the staff in full strength. This will enhance the room tariff,” says Saxena.“It may take a year or two for the situation to return to normal. Agra is not going to be the same in the near future,” he says.“Besides tourists, conferences and weddings held in hotels contribute to the tourism trade here. With social distancing norms in force, the future does not appear healthy,” says Saxena.Tourism information officer Pradeep Tamta says it will take another six months for the revival of tourism in Agra.“The hotel industry and the travel trade are all looking for an early revival. We have to work a lot while sanitising hotels, cabs and other means of transport once Covid-19 is on the backfoot. We are keeping our fingers crossed,” Tamta says.KC Jain, secretary of the Agra Development Foundation, agrees the road to normality will be a long one. Nevertheless, he is optimistic that sooner or later, the Taj Mahal gates will reopen and the city’s economy, based on tourism and the footwear industry, will bounce back.“Tourism is a leisure activity. The global economic scenario should also remain healthy. Certainly, there are challenges ahead. But the way number of Covid-19 cases is increasing in Agra, it may delay normalcy,” says Jain.Shamshuddin, a veteran tourist guide, says the gains from US President Donald Trump’s Agra visit were swept away by Covid-19 cases.As for the footwear industry, it remains doubtful whether its showpiece event, ‘Meet at Agra’, will be held in the second half of the year due to the Covid-19 situation.Agra Footwear Manufacturers and Export Council (AFMEC) holds the event. Agra has a 28% share in India’s footwear exports but given the scenario in the European market, tough days are ahead, those in the know of things say.“The footwear business in Agra is worth about Rs 4,000 crore. About 65 % of Indians wear footwear made in Agra. The export business is worth about Rs 3,000 crore, but exporters are yet to receive payments for consignments they sent prior to the coronavirus outbreak,” says Gagan Dass Ramani, president of the Agra Shoe Factors Federation.“The Rs 4,000 crore domestic market will shrink to Rs 1,000 crore even if the Covid-19 situation does not worsen. There is uncertainty over the footwear trade, the backbone of Agra’s economy,” he says.“For the domestic market’s requirement, we use (shoe) uppers imported from China. But we have to look for new markets like Taiwan in the changed global scenario,” he adds.Similarly, Noori Darwaza lanes, famous for Agra’s famous dalmoth, a salted snack, and petha sweet are wearing a deserted look. Most workers employed in the trade have returned to their villages due to the lockdown.Rajesh Agarwal, president of the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Gate Petha Utpadan Samiti, says revival of the petha and dalmoth industry depends on the tourism industry. “Five hundred units and 3,000 retail shops, beside farmers producing the ash gourd vegetable (a type of white pumpkin) used in petha, are all jobless these days. The petha industry in Agra is also dependent on the tourism trade. These small-scale units need government support,” he says.“There is a market for petha in rural areas as well as it is a cheaper option for sweets and it is purchased by farmers to welcome guests. About a lakh (100,000) people are associated with the petha trade in Agra,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-shadow-of-covid-crisis-agra-stares-at-long-road-to-recovery/story-C6Y36lnkRQJMDHgIkLNqYL.html
08-05-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh brings in labour reforms amid Covid-19 crisis||Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday announced that the process of issuing registrations and licenses for factories, shops, etc will now be completed in a day as part of a series of labour reforms to increase industrial activities, job opportunities as well as to woo fresh investments and safeguard interests of labourers.He called the announcement revolutionary. “Registrations/licenses under the different labour laws will be issued in just one day. Earlier, this time was 30 days,” he said. “Under the Contract Labour Act, licenses will be issued for entire contract periods instead of just for calendar years. The process of issuing registration/license will be online. With a view to encouraging startups, a provision has been made for one-time registrations and the provision for renewal has been done away with.”He said the duration of factory shifts has been increased from 8 hours to 12 hours in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Chouhan added a provision has been made to maintain a single register instead of 61 registers under labour laws and filing of one return instead of 13 returns. Chouhan announced that under the Factory Act, an exemption has been given to factories for their inspection for three months. “The employers will be allowed to have a third party inspection of factories by the inspectors of their choice. Establishments employing less than 50 workers have been excluded from inspections under various labour laws. Now inspections will be possible only with the permission of the labour commissioner and on the basis of complaints.”Shops will also now remain open in the non-Covid-19 areas from 6 am to midnight. Earlier, they were allowed to remain open from 8 am to 10 pm daily. Opposition Congress lawmaker Hiralal Alawa opposed the amendments saying they will give enough powers to factory owners to exploit the labourers at will as they will have no fear of any inspection or inquiry. “The amendments mean the labourers will be treated as bonded labourers and they will not be able to seek justice from the labour courts or it will take years for them to get justice given the complexities involved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-brings-in-labour-reforms-amid-crisis/story-L5KTrSdFAGHoG0smgvnNyK.html
08-05-2020||India||Covid-19 peak likely to hit between May and August: AIIMS director||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India is likely to see its peak between May and August, said Dr Randeep Guleria, director All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi.“This is based on several mathematic modelling data that is available on disease progression, depending on whose data you are looking at. Several data experts are at work, but one cannot definitely predict when the disease is going to peak in India because it depends on a number of variables that are dynamic in nature, such as the effect of lockdown and other measures. The peak may vary accordingly, which is why even the same group sometimes comes up with different projections. The current projections give a range between May and August,” said Dr Guleria.The graph is currently showing an upwards trend, with the total number of Covid-19 positive cases reported in a day having nearly doubled from 1,790 a week ago on April 30 to 3,561 cases on May 7, taking the total number of infected in the country to 52,952 so far. The number of deaths reported from Covid-19 currently is 1,783. The number of critical Covid-19 cases -- those put on ventilator, needing oxygen support, or undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit -- has also seen significant increase, with 1.1% of the active Covid-19 cases on ventilators, 3.3% on oxygen support and 4.8% patients in ICUs across India as on May 7, according to health ministry data. The number has shot up significantly in just three days, as on May 4, the Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had announced that the percentage of ventilator patients fluctuated between 0.33 and 0.37%, those needing oxygen support was 1.5% and those undergoing treatment in ICUs was 2.34%.“Our disease control is the best in the world,” said the health minister.Dr Guleria agrees. “The number of patients needing ventilator or on ICU beds may have shot up in past few days but the overall number of critically ill patients is still very small. Covid-19 patients in India are largely on oxygen support. It is still within the limits of what we have as far as resources are concerned. Our infrastructure hasn’t been overwhelmed. In fact, far from it,” he said.As of now, 821 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, with 1,50,059 beds (1, 32,219 isolation beds and 17,840 ICU beds) and 1,898 dedicated Covid Health Centres, with 1,19,109 beds (1, 09,286 isolation beds and 9,823 ICU beds), along with 7,569 quarantine centres, are now available in the country to manage patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-peak-likely-to-hit-between-may-and-august-aiims-director/story-HNru194rIaRPLkpy0f0pMK.html
08-05-2020||India||Govt okays home, hotel isolation for milder Covid-19 patients||Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients with mild symptoms can stay in hotels and service apartments in case they don’t have space in their own residences to confine themselves in isolation, according to the Union health ministry’s revised guidelines on home quarantine for Covid patients.The facility can be offered on paid basis as is being done by certain states for travellers and contacts of covid-19 cases. The price can be pre-decided by state governments.“There are large number of facilities such as hotels, service apartments, lodges which remain unoccupied due to impact of COVID-19 on travel and tourism. There are also instances where people who don’t have requisite space at home may opt for such facilities. This is likely to reduce the pressure on the family, give comfort to the person, and protect the family members and immediate neighborhood,” read the health ministry guidelines.The ministry has issued standard operating procedures that are applicable both for facility quarantine, facility isolation in hotels, service apartments, lodges etc.“It is an extension of health ministry’s earlier guidelines on home quarantine for positive patients. Since about 80% positive cases have mild symptoms they do not really require to be in a hospital, and many people do not have adequate space in their homes to be able to successfully isolate themselves, for such people it was decided to allow them to use private facilities. Earlier also hotels, lodges, hostels etc have served as quarantined centres, it will be the same with extra precautions,” said an official from the health ministry, requesting anonymity.It will be states’ responsibility to ensure that the quarantine and isolation facility will not co-exist.These facilities will offer single room on paid basis to contacts, cases with attached washrooms. The tariff for the accommodation and services shall be fixed by the facility in consultation with the state government and widely publicized.“The facility dedicated for isolation will follow the norms established for COVID Care Centre as available. The cases shall only be kept in an isolation facility, if the cases are clinically assessed to be pre-symptomatic or very mild. Such facility that opts for isolation will have separate earmarked areas for keeping suspect cases and confirmed cases and will ensure no inter-mingling of these two categories,” the guidelines further reads.The facility owner will have to make additional arrangements for an in-house trained doctor and a nurse on 24X7 basis. The doctor will monitor the contacts, cases in quarantine, isolation facilities once a day on basic parameters of temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and pulse oxymetry and keep record of the same.The doctor engaged by the facility will inform the District Surveillance Officer regarding the list of admitted cases or contacts, and their health status. The facility should network with an approved laboratory for testing samples as per ICMR guidelines. The patients should not be allowed to meet visitors. However, they can talk on phone. The facility will provide Wi-Fi facility and ensure that the client downloads the Aarogya Setu App on mobile.The linens, towels etc. and rooms should be disinfected and the facility will follow infection prevention control practices as per health ministry guidelines.The in-house catering should only provide room services for freshly cooked food duly following physical distancing and environmental sanitation. The discharge of patients from the facility will be as per the health ministry directive for discharged of covid-19 patients from the hospital.“The most important discharge criteria is that these people should test negative twice in a span of 24 hours, and should be certified fit to be discharged from their treating medical doctor,” the official added.Experts say as long as the protocol is followed, there is no harm in home or facility isolation of mild positive cases.“I am a big believer of home isolation as at least 90% of the cases, according to me are mild enough to not require hospitalization. As long precautions are taken and there is regular medical consultation, it is a good idea,” said T Jacob John, senior virologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-okays-home-hotel-isolation-for-milder-patients/story-V28ypulkLyMQVLE3Q5FoxK.html
08-05-2020||India||From Friday, DD weather forecasts will send a daily reminder to Pakistan||State-run broadcaster Doordarshan will start including weather forecasts for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and the Northern Areas from Friday, a move designed to deliver a daily message to Islamabad that it was holding on to these territories illegally.A senior government official told Hindustan Times that Doordarshan National, DD News, All India Radio and Kashir channels had been told to include these territories in its daily weather bulletins along with other places in the country. Doordarshan’s Kashmir channel is telecast in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir.Doordarshan’s weather bulletin will have forecasts for Mirpur and Muzaffarabad in Occupied Kashmir and Gilgit in Northern Areas.“The step will also be a constant reminder to the Imran Khan government and its few supporters that India will not allow Islamabad to take any steps to legitimise its illegal occupation,” said a senior government official.The decision coincided with New Delhi’s strong protests this week over the order of Pakistan’s top court that provided for setting up a caretaker administration in Gilgit-Baltistan to hold fresh elections.India claims the whole of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, including the Gilgit-Baltistan region, which was given near-provincial status by the Pakistan government in 2009.Also Watch: ‘They want riots...’: PoK activist on Pakistan bid to hold Gilgit Baltistan pollsIn January 2019, Pakistan’s top court had ruled that its powers extended to “Gilgit-Baltistan” provoking sharp protest from New Delhi, which declared “the so-called ‘Gilgit-Baltistan’, has been, is and shall remain an integral part of India”.Last week, Pakistan’s Supreme Court went a step further and allowed the government to amend the Government of Gilgit-Baltistan Order 2018 to set up a caretaker administration in the region to conduct fresh elections.

08-05-2020||India||Top Hizbul terrorist Riyaz Naikoo was hiding in south Kashmir bunker; killed in overnight op||Riyaz Naikoo, the top Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist who had never been caught, has been gunned down by security forces in a joint operation in his south Kashmir’s village on Wednesday. Naikoo had come to meet his family on Tuesday and stayed overnight at a hideout in Awantipora’s Beighbora village. This was home turf.The 32-year-old, also known by his alias Zubair ul Islam and Bin Qasim, was counted among Kashmir’s most-experienced terrorists. On 5 June, Riyaz Naikoo would have completed eight years in the Hizbul Mujahideen, a rarity in a career where many don’t last for more than a few years. Security forces had come close to cornering him on several occasions; he managed to dodge them every time.WATCH | Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo eliminated: All the key detailsBut on Tuesday, Kashmir Police’s anti-militancy unit Special Operations Group (SOG) had pinpointed information about his movements. He was going to be in his village to meet his family and relatives. According to one account, the SOG had an idea where he would stay overnight.Riyaz Naikoo, the calculative Hizbul terroristHe was the chief operational commander of Hizbul Mujahideen in Jammu and KashmirNaikoo took command of Hizbul Mujahideen after Zakir Musa defected from HizbulRiyaz Naikoo used audio and video clips put out on social media to motivate youth to join terrorHis audio and video messages articulated separatist ideology and praised PakistanJ&K police says he was the brain behind revival of Hizbul in J&KHe is blamed for killing several police personnel and civiliansNaikoo funded terror by looting money from orchard owners and illicit cultivation of opium in south KashmirHizbul Mujahideen has been found to be involved in narco trade in Jammu as wellNaikoo had taken credit for freeing Lashkar-e-Taiba’s Naveed Jutt from custody in 2018Naveed Jutt was shot dead in November 2018, months after his escapeIt was getting dark by the time a large contingent of Jammu and Kashmir police and the 21 Rashtriya Rifles started surrounding the village. “And then, they lay low, waiting for dawn to make the move,” a senior police officer said.A gun battle erupted early on Wednesday.He had been trapped and there was no way to escape.When the firefight was over, security personnel found Riyaz Naikoo in a bunker from where he had been firing at them. He and his associate had died of gunshot wounds.“It is a major success for the security forces in Kashmir,” a senior Jammu and Kashmir Police officer told Hindustan Times. J&K police chief Dilbag Singh had been monitoring the entire operation that the police insisted could break the back of the Hizbul Mujahideen in south Kashmir.In the records of Jammu and Kashmir police, Riyaz Naikoo was listed as “A++” terrorist who had a reward of Rs 1.2 million on his head. According to his dossier, he had studied till class 10 at the Beighpora government high school, cleared his Class 12 from the higher secondary school in Gulzarpora and graduation from the government degree college in Pulwama.He took up a private teacher’s job in Hanfia Model Public School a couple of kilometres away in 2010. It is around this time that he first started helping out the Hizbul before going missing on 5 June 2012 to join the Hizbul at the instance of Sajad Mir, who was later killed.Over the next four years, he climbed the Hizbul hierarchy and came to the attention of the Hizbul boss in Pakistan Syed Salahuddin. After Zakir Musa took over the Hizbul in Kashmir following the killing of Burhan Wani and had differences with its leadership in Pakistan, Riyaz Naikoo stayed on Syed Salahuddin’s right side and became the de facto chief of Hizbul in Kashmir.The Hizbul mostly operates in south Kashmir districts of Kulgam, Shopian and Anantnag and Pulwama. This part of Kashmir has traditionally been seen as the hotbed of homegrown terror fuelled from across the Line of Control.A Jammu and Kashmir police statement later said Naikoo was involved in the killing of a panchayat sarpanch’s father Haji Ghulam Mohd Dar in Dogripora in March 2014, firing on a police bus near Bhatpora Tokena, killing of Ghulam Mohi-Ud-din Dar, murder of Javaid Akbar Khanday of Khandaypora, the murder of head constable Ashiq Hussain Mir at Padgampoara crossing, abduction of constable Naseer Ahmad, lootiing 9 firearms from residence of ex-MLA Wachi, kiiling of six migrant labour in Kulgam,killing of truck drivers and fruit traders post Aug 5 and threatening jail staffers who had stopped the practice of giving preferential treatment to terrorists in jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/riaz-naikoo-aka-bin-qasim-kashmir-s-hizbul-chief-shot-dead-in-overnight-op/story-aLbwShbIpilgSr3gCdjbHO.html
08-05-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown puts trans community in a spot||Urmi Jadhav, 40, has been working for 18 years in the financial capital of the country, Mumbai. A community aid organiser for the transgender community, as well as a member of the troupe, Dancing Queens, which recently performed at a popular Delhi nightclub located in a five star hotel, Jadhav has no nest egg: neither a mutual fund portfolio or a medical insurance policy. “For the past two years, I’ve worked as a consultant as and when projects come my way. So, my income has been erratic. I don’t have money for emergencies. Whatever I earn, I spend in essentials like rent, or food, or medicines.” At present, Jadhav has enough money to pay this month’s rent. Her income for April was supposed to come from five dance shows that her troupe was slated to perform in Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai. All shows have been cancelled on account of the coronavirus global pandemic, and the national lockdown announced on March 24. In an effort to prevent the spread of Sars-CoV-2, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday appealed to all citizens to stay inside their homes till April 14. Already, India has recorded 13 deaths and 649 cases; globally, a lockdown is being seen as the most effective way of breaking the chain of transmitting the virus.Yet, for many members of the transgender community, the lockdown has specific implications on livelihood and access to medicines like Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) for Persons living with the Human Immuno Virus (HIV)/Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or PLHIVs, and those undergoing Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) required for gender transitioning. India is home to the world’s third largest population living with HIV, and according to UNAIDS, the prevalence in transgender communities is 3.1% compared to .26% among all adults. What’s more, given their immuno-compromised state, this makes the HIV+ trans community even more vulnerable to Covid-19.Dr Ishwar Prasad Gilada, a consultant on HIV/AIDS based in Mumbai, said that the biggest problem being faced by PLHIVs is procurement of medicines from ART centres private clinics. “We cannot postpone their medicines. If they don’t take medicines properly, they become HIV drug-resistant, which means the same medicine won’t work for them.”According to Gilada, who has been studying the virus since its outbreak in the 1980s, there are limited therapeutic options available to HIV, which was once a global pandemic killing millions around the world. Drug resistance would mean that mortality and morbidity associated with the disease will increase. Though the lockdown is a necessary step, Gilada said that as a result of it, “supply of medicines may get derailed, mainly due to lack of transport as well as lack of labour / employees involved in the supply chain across different sectors.” While it is advisable to keep a month’s supply of ART drugs, many cannot afford to, said Chandramukhi, 30, a Hyderabad-based trans rights activist. Part of that reason is that their livelihood has taken a hit due to the pandemic and the national lockdown. According to one study, more than 87% of transpersons are dependent on traditional forms of livelihood like ‘badhai’ — earning money by giving blessings during private celebrations — begging and sex work; all have come to a stop, community members said.“There are over 52 transwomen who I am in touch with. Several of them are in need of their Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) medicines. Besides ART medication, persons with HIV/Aids should have healthy food, especially protein. Many of the people I’ve spoken to don’t earn enough money to stock up on supplies. Some don’t even have rice left in their house,” said Chandramukhi. Many are in need of medical care after having undergone gender affirmation surgery recently. “Doctors aren’t being allowed to travel to administer care. They need injections, medical gauze, cotton, and antibiotics, but none of it is reaching them right now,” she said.Telangana declared a lockdown earlier this week with the chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao saying that shoot-at-sight orders may be given if people disobey the lockdown.Soumya Gupta, a trans rights activist based in Delhi cited Kerala — which announced on Wednesday that it would provide free provision kits comprising rice, pulses, and cooking oil, among other things, to transpersons — as an instance of a government-run scheme that could benefit the community if rolled out nationally. Several members of the community on Wednesday also sent an appeal to the government to ensure that they are provided basic provisions, as their livelihood has taken a hit.A 22-year-old transwoman based in Noida, who did not wish to divulge her identity, said while she earns money through sex work, she was attending a government-run skills development programme this past month in the hope that she would get a steady source of employment. However, her three-month long course was cut short because of the coronavirus pandemic. Her father is a daily wage worker, while her mother is a domestic worker. “Both of them have been home for the past week, and money is running out,” she said. Shivraj (who goes by his first name), a 22-year-old transman from Odisha, joined a skill development course meant specifically for members of the trans community run by the National Backward Classes Financial Development Corporation, an arm of the ministry of social justice and empowerment. The course aimed to impart training that would help the participants get jobs as retail sales associates. However, the one-and-a-half-month long course was cut short on March 20, following the pandemic. Of the 13 participants, eight are from out of town and cannot head back. Shaman Gupta, co-chair at Tweet Foundation, a Delhi-based community organisation that aided the government in conducting the training, fears that with the economic slowdown imminent, most would not be able to get placements in companies. “After the training, I was hoping I would get a job, and I would save money to transition. The job market is tough, and it’s not easy for a transman to get employment,” said Shivraj. “I’m living on hope.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-puts-trans-community-in-a-spot/story-AUbABkMtn9NRMOcYczGj0H.html
08-05-2020||Editorials||Vizag is a wake-up call to ensure industrial safety | HT Editorial||The gas leak from a chemical factory in Vizag, which killed 12 people, is the most serious of three industrial accidents that have taken place since the national lockdown was eased on May 3. The other two were in Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh. That the Vizag leak happened within a kilometre from a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) red zone means that people have breached restrictions to escape the effects of the gas that has spread over a five km area. Though the numbers are far smaller, the tragedy brings back memories of the Bhopal gas leak, the worst industrial disaster in the world, which killed at least 3,800 people. The Vizag plant leak was styrene, a benzene derivative used to manufacture plastics and resin. Exposure to it causes headache, loss of hearing and irritation to the mucous membrane, among other things. It can stay in the air for weeks and combine with oxygen to form the lethal styrene dioxide. The Centre for Science and Environment said that the leak seems to have happened because of the haste to restart the plant without carrying out proper maintenance work. While the government must focus on rescue and relief for now, what is also required is a time-bound investigation to ascertain how safety was compromised and fix accountability. Reports suggest the plant has functioned without proper environmental clearances for a substantial period since it was set up. It must also be asked how the South Korean petrochemical giant, which owns LG polymers, the site of the accident, did not ensure that qualified people were in place to check systems and open the plant. What happened in Vizag should be considered a warning for other industries which are resuming operations after a lengthy lockdown. India’s industrial safety record has been patchy at the best of times. Now in the aftermath of the lockdown, it is likely to get further eroded. While it is necessary to kick-start the economic engine, it cannot be at the risk of compromising the safety of workers and those who live in the vicinity of industrial plants. If anything, with serious labour shortages and monetary challenges brought on by Covid-19, it becomes even more necessary to strengthen both public and occupational safety systems. Industries must comply with regulations, and the government must ensure that they are strictly enforced. Lives are at stake.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/ensuring-industrial-safety/story-5g6BsqbXr2qDE0xNV05zAK.html
