The first impact will be on those who had mental health challenges before the pandemic. Their problems will almost certainly be exacerbated. There is already an increasing number of attempts at self-harm. There is also an increase in burn-out cases among caregivers of those with mental health issues.  The second direct impact is likely to be among the general population. The psychological feelings of fear, loss, and helplessness may lead to increasing levels of anxiety and depression. Other psychiatric problems such as adjustment disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders and mood disorders are likely to rise. Alcoholism, substance abuse and other forms of risky behaviour could increase. The indirect impact on mental health is likely to be even more alarming. The psycho-social realities related to Covid-19 may include risks of discrimination and violence related to gender, children and caste. Disability-related adversity will further exacerbate morbidity and mortality related to mental health problems. These will be magnified by unemployment, malnourishment and poverty. The process of grieving has begun. A significant proportion of the population seems to be numbed by the experience. Many are getting on with their lives as though nothing has happened. These people are vulnerable. Many are covering up their feelings of helplessness with bravado. They feel the need to couch their predicament in terms that are controllable and changeable. The sociological impact of the pandemic is also unfolding. Stories of benevolence coexist with those of lynchings, suicides and exploitation. Many people are beginning to externalise their anger by attacking health care providers. The increase in mental health problems and psycho-social effects will impact the growth of the pandemic also. There will be decreased compliance with the containment and treatment processes. This could be explained by the phenomenon of negative self-appraisal, where people label themselves as weak and helpless with little control over their fate. In the longer term, disabilities related to mental health problems are likely to grow. Incidents of suicide and self-harm may also increase.  As “the opening up” begins, there may be a workforce that is not motivated to participate, a community unwilling to buy and a proportion of people waiting to exploit. The pandemic will leave in its wake communities that will need to be rebuilt. How should society respond to these challenges? The solutions have to focus on healing the community, and not just healing the individual. The response should be three-tiered. At the primary level, psychological recovery and sensitivity need to be intertwined with relief and recovery processes that focus on the resilience of communities. There should be mental health first aid, empathetic relationships within a framework of dignity, participation, purposefulness, and an effort to expeditiously return to education and work. All these have to go hand-in-hand with psychological and psychiatric interventions. However, there is an urgent need to bring about innovations in the way mental health services are designed, how human resources are trained and how access to service is made possible. The current mental health interventions are tertiary. We need social distancing equivalents for mental health. At the secondary level, online mental health services must be facilitated to support individuals with early signs of problems. This support could include dissemination of information about mental health, guided self-help programmes through webinars, telepsychiatry and teletherapy. The secondary level support should also include specific support for health care providers. Mental health/psychosocial mobile teams should reach out to those who are more vulnerable and homebound. There have to be specific mental health services linked to children and survivors of violence. Tertiary-level mental health services should include traditional services such as providing biological, psychological and social interventions for those with ongoing mental health problems and those with high support needs. The policies that govern the development and delivery of community mental health services will have to be simplified. The other service provider (OSP) licences for telemedicine and tele-education are likely barriers. The current definition of mental health professionals makes post-graduates in psychology and social work unavailable for this fight. Mental health is not just an issue of an individual feeling good. In the time of the Covid-19 pandemic, mental health disorders could take on the form of an epidemic. So many lives depend on how we respond to this challenge. We must remember that like Covid-19, mental health, too, has no vaccine in sight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-will-aggravate-mental-health-issues-analysis/story-RtnJ6JhiHKkNRb67n7oR6L.html

The government at various levels is using the technology platforms provided by the IT department for gathering information, monitoring and decision-making in an efficient manner said Rohan Chand, director of the IT department.To provide efficient and digitised facilities to people, Covid curfew ePass application was developed. This application has been beneficial in reducing physical interaction and applicants can get e-pass online through a link sent via SMS. So far 4,75,529 applications have been received and about 1,57,990 e-Passes have been issued after scrutiny and verification.To facilitate the interstate movement of HP residents stranded in other states and likewise people of other states stranded in Himachal Pradesh, now such persons can also apply for e-Pass at http://covidepass.hp.gov.in. Officials said that Covid curfew ePass has proved a boon to a large number of persons stranded in different parts of the country.To further strengthen this, state nodal officer and state joint nodal officer along with other nodal officers have been appointed to collect, collate and compile the data pertaining to the requests received for interstate movement and formulation of a comprehensive plan, devise protocol and facilitate the movement of people.For maintaining the record of quarantined persons, a health worker has been assigned to each quarantined person, to track the violation of quarantined location by Covid-19 suspects and generate alerts in case of violations, the department has developed the Covid Quarantine App (http://covid19.hp.gov.in).Corona Mukt Himachal Mobile App is also part of this system which is to be installed on the mobile phone of a quarantined person. It has the facility of locking the quarantine location, so that alerts are generated in case of violations. Besides this, the training of health officials (NHM, DSOs and BMOs) was done by the IT department at districts and block levels through video conference. The data of about 445 quarantined persons has already been entered.To provide a common place for all government orders, advisories and media bulletins to avoid any misinformation or rumour, the department has developed ‘Covid Government Orders’ available on http://covidorders.hp.gov.in.An application has also been developed for monitoring law and order related issues across the state. An application has been developed to monitor the law and order related issues across the state. The application named ‘Law and Order Monitoring and Reporting System’ provides facility to superintendents of police and police stations for uploading law and order related information, as desired by the Union ministry of home affairs and consolidate the same on the portal and make the same available to the state government, director-general of police, SPs and SHOs.Each police station is required to report law and order related status on the portal four times a day and six-hourly report daily containing the number of violations of lockdown/curfew, arrests made, vehicles seized, FIRs registered, fines imposed and law and order incidents reported including preventive actions taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/how-apps-developed-by-it-department-helping-maintain-social-distancing-in-hp/story-DmRCKowejnfY2CDPOen14H.html
05-05-2020||City||State govt failed to conduct screening, testing of people entering HP: Cong||Expressing concern over the two fresh cases of coronavirus in the state, Himachal Pradesh Congress president Kuldeep Rathore on Tuesday lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government claiming that it is not conducting proper screening and scanning of the people who are returning to Himachal from other states.While addressing a press conference here, Rathore questioned the data presented by chief minister Jai Ram Thakur to Prime Minister Narendra Modi via video-conferencing last week. “If collecting information by sending Asha and Anganwadi workers to every household is screening, then it is a very surprising claim by him,” he said.“As per the information, out of 70 lakh people in the state, only 7,000 have been tested, which is only 0.1% of the total population,” the state Congress chief said, adding that the state does not has enough number of testing kits then how can the state government claim Himachal is corona-free.Accusing Jai Ram of misguiding the state residents, Rathore said that we are worried about the Covid-19 spread in the state. “We need a basic structure to fight the virus,” he said.Hitting out at the central government, Rathore said that the Centre can make arrangements for evacuating around 15 lakhs non-resident Indians (NRIs) from different countries but it cannot make arrangements to send poor people and labourers, who are stranded within the country, home. None of the NRIs were screened or tested, he claimed.He also demanded the Centre to issue white papers of the PM-Cares Fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/state-govt-failed-to-conduct-screening-testing-of-people-entering-hp-cong/story-V1sElIVg21MejkRXCrSsHM.html
05-05-2020||Lucknow||Allahabad high court reserves verdict on Ghazipur MP’s PIL on ‘azaan’||The Allahabad high court on Tuesday reserved its verdict on a public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by BSP MP from Ghazipur Afzal Ansari seeking lifting of ban on ‘azaan’ (call to prayer) from mosques in Ghazipur. After hearing the counsel for the petitioner and the state counsel, a division bench comprising justice Shashi Kant Gupta and justice Ajit Kumar ordered to reserve the judgment. Earlier, appearing the petitioner’s counsel Syed Safdar Ali Kazmi argued that there was no specific order in the central or state government guidelines to prohibit azaan from mosques. Therefore, the arbitrary decision taken by the district administration of Ghazipur was illegal. The state government through additional advocate general Manish Goyal submitted its stand before the court stating that religious activity of any religious group through loudspeaker had been restricted across UP in view of the guidelines of lockdown imposed to check spread of Covid-19.The govt also said since Ghazipur district had been declared a corona hotspot, as per the guidelines issued by union ministry of home affairs on March 24, 2020 certain restrictions were imposed there. The state government in its affidavit also submitted a list of instances filed disclosing how people assembled in mosques in Ghazipur following a call through ‘azaan’ and the administration had a tough time in controlling the situation.In the PIL petition filed on April 28, the MP had alleged that all of a sudden from April 24 onwards it was found that azaan from mosques was prohibited by local administration of Ghazipur and police and that if anyone dared to make azaan, they would be booked under National Security Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/allahabad-high-court-reserves-verdict-on-ghazipur-mp-s-pil-on-azaan/story-LgEWWKnU5VLsYo49QHlefO.html
05-05-2020||Chandigarh||Appointment of OSD to ex-Akali minister as commission member sparks row||The appointment of Ravee Ahluwalia, who was officer on special duty (OSD) to former Akali minister Surjit Singh Rakhra during the previous government, as member of the Punjab State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, has sparked a row in the ruling Congress in the state. Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s wife and Patiala MP Preneet Kaur besides some Congress MLAs have raised objection to the appointment that was notified by principal secretary (social security and women & child development) Raji P Shrivastva on Monday. What has shocked the Congress workers is the fact that Ravee had actively campaigned against Amarinder’s son Raninder Singh who lost from the Samana assembly seat in 2012 to Rakhra. Later, as OSD to Rakhra, he also remained in the forefront of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)’s campaign against Preneet Kaur when she lost in the 2014 parliamentary polls. He was OSD to Rakhra till 2017. “I don’t approve of this appointment. I am surprised how and why it was done. Ravee has worked against Raninder and the Congress. How we can reward him with a post. Our workers are demoralised over this. I will take up the matter with the CM,” said Preneet. Usually, the nomination of those from the Patiala constituency for government posts is made on the recommendation of Preneet, who consults party MLAs and workers.Congress’ Samana MLA Rajinder Singh, who upped the ante, against the move said, “This appointment has certainly demoralised our party workers. I am sure this was not brought to the notice of the CM. I will approach him.”Rajinder Singh defeated Rakhra in the 2017 polls.Rajpura MLA of the ruling party, Hardial Singh Kamboj, also questioned the decision. “Everyone knows that as Rakhra’s OSD, Ravee worked against our party and remained in the forefront of the SAD campaign against Raninder and Preneet Kaur. I wonder who rewarded him with this post. The appointment certainly needs to be probed as no one from our parliamentary segment has recommended his name.” When contacted, Ahluwalia said he left association with Rakhra even before the 2017 elections. “My appointment was made purely on the basis of merit. I applied for the post advertised in November 2019 and they finalised my name by assessing my bio data. Moreover, no major remunerations come with this post,” he said.The department officials said the terms, conditions and perks of the commission chairperson and members will be notified later as per budgetary provisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/appointment-of-osd-to-ex-akali-minister-as-commission-member-sparks-row/story-ok4Y5nvACXozKSwhH3XAsO.html
05-05-2020||Mumbai||57% of Mumbai’s containment zones are congested: BMC data||More than half of the city’s containment zones are congested spaces consisting majorly of informal settlements. An analysis of the data published by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on its website reveals that 1,179 of the 2,083 or about 57% containment zones in the city are congested, as identified by the BMC. Over 400 of the 2,083 containment zones have been removed from the list, an official said. In 16 of the total 24 wards, more than 50% of the containment zones are congested, while six wards have containment zones where 70% of the areas are congested. The civic body defines containment zones as “places where positive (cases) have been detected and that surrounding area have been sealed to protect everyone inside and outside from further spread (of Covid-19).” While it has not defined congested spaces in exact terms, a look at the data shows that it consists mostly of informal settlements. A BMC ward officer from central Mumbai, on condition of anonymity, said, “The definition [of congested areas] includes both, places which are highly populated and places that are also not easily accessible making it all the more difficult to impose containment measures.”According to the data, the L ward or Kurla, which is a largely crowded area, has 233 containment zones, of which 193 or 83% are congested areas. Similarly, H-East ward which consists of Bandra’s slum pockets has 135 containment zones, of which, 70% are congested spaces.In A ward (which includes areas like Fort), seven to nine containment zones have been identified as congested pockets.Pankaj Joshi, executive director of the Urban Design Research Institute (UDRI) said, “High-density and indoor crowding in informal settlements makes social distancing impossible in Mumbai. In all, 80% of the informal settlements live in houses that are less than 10 square metres.”A 2016 survey done during the revision of the city’s Development Plan (DP) also found that the per capita residential area in the city is 8.3 square meters. About 42% of the city’s population lives in slums occupying only 33.96 sq km or just 8% of Mumbai’s total area.“Slum-rehabilitation has to be looked at more holistically post the lockdown with more models of development like self-housing,” Joshi added. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/57-of-mumbai-s-containment-zones-are-congested-bmc-data/story-QulXw7TMsh2gRv9i79amTK.html

05-05-2020||City||KDMC asks residents working in Mumbai to stay back||Residents of Kalyan, Dombivli and Ulhasnagar who are travelling to Mumbai every day for work will not be allowed to enter the city limits from May 8. They have been asked to stay back in Mumbai till May 17 in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19.Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation recorded 11 Covid positive cases on Tuesday, taking the total tally to 224.“I respect and salute those who are part of essential or emergency services and travel to Mumbai regularly for work. However, among the 224 Covid positive cases in Kalyan, 73 are those who work in these sectors and 28 of their relatives have also been affected. We want to check such cases and stop the spread of the virus,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, commissioner of Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC).Suryavanshi said they are forced to bar their entry from May 8 to May 17 for the safety of residents and the family members of those working in Mumbai.“Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has agreed to provide facilities to stay in hotels for those under healthcare services, however, those who are working in the banking or other sectors have been given two days’ time to make provisions for their stay. We are taking this step after keeping in mind the safety of the family members and neighbours of those who are offering such services,” added Suryavanshi. He said the residents who work in Mumbai will have to submit their details on the email ID given on the KDMC website.Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) too has decided to do the same.“All those who are working in Mumbai need to give details of their name, address, office address and contact details and submit it to the municipal corporation as soon as possible,” said Sudhakar Deshmukh, UMC commissioner. UMC has 16 Covid positive patients. Activists, politicians happy with decisionFor the past one week, positive cases in Kalyan have been increasing and politicians and activists had demanded that those going to Mumbai given accommodation there.“Officials have observed that the cases in the past few days were of those who are either in close contact of positive patients or are travelling to Mumbai for work. To curb the spread of the virus, it is essential to stop people from travelling so that fewer people get infected. KDMC has asked those who are part of essential and emergency services to share their details. Officials have two days’ time for making arrangements,” said Pramod (Raju) Patil, MLA, Kalyan.Activist Sreenivas Ghanekar said the KDMC must have consulted the state government and BMC before announcing this decision. “After getting the list of people travelling to Mumbai every day, the authorities will be able to ensure accommodation facility. The step will also help figure out if the Covid-19 spread is actually from those working outside,” said Ghanekar.A nurse, who lives in Dombivli and works in a government hospital in Mumbai, is happy with the decision but is worried about the facilities she will get.“I welcome the decision even though I will not meet my family. At least, I will be happy that they are safe. Most of us working in Mumbai travel by the same public buses, making us more vulnerable. I am only concerned about the accommodation given to us,” said the nurse, travels to work every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kdmc-asks-residents-working-in-mumbai-to-stay-back/story-vrdNLVzgKq4RNrjppYd0gI.html

05-05-2020||Lucknow||Hospitals start OPD under fresh guidelines in Lucknow||Several hospitals in Lucknow started OPD under the fresh guidelines – screening patients for coronavirus symptoms even before they are seen for the problem they report to the doctor.“The OPDs now have an additional screening area. Before patient can reach doctors’ chamber they are screened for any Covid-19 symptoms. This not only ensures the infected ones will identified but also instills confidence among patients,” said Dr Sandeep Kapoor, director Healthcity hospital, who has initiated the new protocol in his hospital and has been part of the committee that framed it.The protocol demands hospitals to ensure no patient enters OPD area or goes into a ward without screening.In case admission is required, till screening or Covid test is done, patient remains in an isolation facility/triage area in the hospital and is attended by teams wearing protective gear.“The effort is to give health services a push in such a manner that hospitals can run smoothly and do not have to face actions such as closure by making mistakes in infection control exercise,” said Dr Kapoor.“In the laboratories it has been ensured that patients have least contact with doctor and staff. The sampling areas have been redesigned to maintain distance between the patients and lab staff,” said Dr Rama Srivastava, president IMA, Lucknow.About 50 hospitals in the state capital have started OPD facility under the fresh protocol and now the health department is also monitoring their working. More hospitals are likely to join the list in the next few days. “The idea is to make sure those with symptoms of Covid-9 are identified and attended separately,” said Dr Anoop Agrawal, chairperson, Nursing Home Cell, IMA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/hospitals-start-opd-under-fresh-guidelines-in-lucknow/story-JNb6yJjtlb5ZMppJxMuvfP.html

Some of us are showing symptoms like cold, cough and sore throat ache. We have not been tested despite being one of her high-risk contacts.”The doctors also alleged that no personal protection equipment (PPE) kits have been given to them even while working in isolation ward.The doctor added, “They do not insist on PPE while working in isolation ward at times. We have asked them to quarantine those who had come in contact with the doctor but nothing has been done.”The dean refuted the allegations saying that all safety equipment is provided to the medical staff and those who were working with the doctor will be quarantined. He said, “We provide required safety kit for doctors who work in isolation wards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/not-quarantined-after-kalwa-hospital-doctor-tested-positive-medical-staff/story-Ni3IRImKrsoI5061PVGaFP.html
05-05-2020||Chandigarh||People residing in Chandigarh’s containment zones continue to battle uncertainty||As the rest of the city starts to get a sense of normalcy, people in the six containment zones are still grappling with panic, stigma and uncertainty.The residents of these zones have to stand for 4 to 5 hours daily in long queues for ration and vegetables even as residents in other parts of the city start moving freely. Some residents in the containment zones complained that even quarantined people stand in lines along with non-quarantined people for buying essential commodities and social distancing norms are still being flouted in some parts of Bapu Dham Colony, Labour Colony, Sector 30, and Kachi Colony in Dhanas.More than 75% of the total cases in the city are from the six containment zones, including Bapu Dham Colony, Labour Colony in Sector 30, Dhanas Kachi Colony, part of Sector 38, parts of Sector 52 and part of Shastri Nagar in Manimajra.Bapu Dham Colony with 58 cases of the total 115 Covid-19 cases in the city accounts for nearly 50% of the city’s cases, while Labour Colony, Sector 30, has 20 cases.These areas have been sealed by the UT Administration. Around 80,000 people live in these zones.Social stigmaMore than 40 positive cases have come from the neighbourhood of Varinder Pal, 46, a resident of Bapu Dham Colony, Sector 26, Pal said, “Even a throat itch sends shiver down our spine. People are restless and struggling to cope with the tag of epicentre of the pandemic in the city.”After he came in contact with a Covid-19 positive person at his shop in Bapu Dham Colony, Ajay Sharma, 43, was quarantined. “Near my house cum shop, there lives a family with multiple positive cases and one of them came to my shop. I informed the authorities about it. They quarantined me even after I didn’t show any symptoms, but with asymptomatic cases increasing, my family of eight is concerned about our future.”Living in a containment zone, residents complained they have been stigmatised. “Some of the junior UT officials, vendors and police personnel often humiliate us and blame us for the spread of disease in the city. Even our friends from other city areas look down upon us, but it is not our fault. It can happen anywhere and to anybody,” Sharma said.Similar sentiments were expressed by Surinder Pal, a professional photographer and a resident of Labour Colony, Sector 30. “When we go to buy ration from the delivery bus, the vendor throws stuff at us instead of politely giving it us. Even after repeated requests, they treat us like criminals.”Social distancing a distant dreamIn the colonies, people are jam-packed. “In one of my adjacent houses, 25 people live together and in another, family of 15. With only 4-feet-high walls separating one house from another and strong social cohesion, people still venture out to interact with each other,” said Pal.Even though police inspect the areas, but in the inner lanes, people can still be seen roaming outside their houses.“There are volunteers deputed to bring ration and vegetables to the door steps of quarantined houses. But, they still venture out, covering their stamped hands with gloves and stand in lines. Though their neighbours identify them, but most people have no clue. This is a very dangerous situation for all us. Administration must ensure separate queues for them,” said Manjit Garcha, a resident of Labour Colony.Dalip Sharma, councillor from Bapu Dham Colony, said, “I receive around 300 calls from local people seeking help on different issues daily. Some of the panicky calls were from the 700 migrant workers trapped in the containment zone. Struggling with fast depleting resources, they are desperate to leave for their native states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/people-residing-in-chandigarh-s-containment-zones-continue-to-battle-uncertainty/story-xRHWjrotP5wbtAIOUo0msO.html
05-05-2020||City||Prices of vegetables to shoot up as mandis at Khandsa, Farrukhnagar and Pataudi shut||Gurugram: As the Khandsa mandi, the wholesale market for vegetables and fruits in Gurugram, has been shut till May 8 after nine vendors were found Covid-19 positive, local vegetable sellers said on Tuesday that retail prices of kitchen staples like onion, potato and tomato will increase from Wednesday.However, officials of Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board (HSAMB) said they have enough stock to meet the city’s demand for the next three days. The situation may get worse as two other mandis -- at Pataudi and Farrukhnagar -- have also been shut for two days starting May 6 in order to facilitate disinfection and protect wholesalers and retailers from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“With the announcement of the closure of Khandsa mandi, retailers procured the stock on Monday night that can last for the next three days. Dealers have also restricted the supply to vendors coming from other states for the period,” said Vinay Yadav, HSAMB secretary (Gurugram district). On Monday night, the HSAMB had to close the mandi after nine vegetable sellers were confirmed Covid-19 positive, having links with Delhi’s Azadpur mandi where 17 positive cases have been reported.Retail prices of vegetables at markets like Sadar Bazar already shoot up on Tuesday. “On Monday, the price of potato was Rs 20 per kg, which has gone up to Rs 40, while onion rates have increased from Rs 30 per kg to Rs 45 per kg. Prices of some other vegetables like ginger and tomato my also go up,” said Rohit Yadav, a vegetable seller at Sadar Bazar, who has stock available for the next two days. Some retailers said that they don’t have enough stock that will last till Friday (May 8). “I have limited stock with me. I was solely dependent on the Khandsa wholesale market for vegetables. It will lead to rise in prices,” said Subhash Lal, another retailer from Sadar Bazar.However, HSAMB officials said several teams are already deployed in different retail markets to check the price fluctuation. “Our teams will be visiting major vegetable markets to check the prices at which vegetables and fruits are being sold. If anyone is found selling at a higher rate, action will be taken accordingly,” said Vinay Yadav of HSAMB. Raj Kumar Beniwal, chief marketing enforcement officer, HSAMB, said, “Our focus is on ensuring demand and supply and controlling price fluctuations. We will take legal action against vegetable sellers who are found disrupting the market prices.”“There will be no dearth of the vegetable stock till May 8. The supply chain will be maintained. We will be supplying the stock from other districts of Haryana,” Beniwal said.DEPENDENCY ON SMALL MANDIS, OTHER DISTRICTSEvery day 5,000-6,000 quintals of vegetables and fruits arrive at the Khandsa mandi from Delhi’s Azadpur mandi, neighbouring districts like Nuh within the state and from states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. But on Tuesday, there was no fresh arrival at the mandi.HSAMB’s Vinay Yadav said, “Locally produced vegetables and green leafy vegetables are being sold by the farmers in smaller mandis like Badshahpur, from where retailers can easily procure the produce. To ensure the supply is not affected in the condominiums and residential areas, the vegetable collection centres of retail chains is completely functional. Farmers from Pataudi and Farrukhnagar are providing their stock to these collection centres.” Currently, there are 60 collection centres where farmers sell their produce to retail chains.Raj Kumar Aggarwal, a wholesaler at Khandsa mandi, said, “There are small mandis within 10-15 kilometres area of Gurugram where many retailers buy vegetables. Before the major mandis were closed, sellers and retailers had stocked up the produce. In case the stock is over, small mandis are still functional where farmers are dropping their produce from nearby districts.”Some online marketplaces said that their prices will remain unaffected irrespective of what happens at Khandsa wholesale market. Naveen Yadav, who works at Fruit Uncle (online fruit and vegetable store), said, “We are getting our supplies directly from the farmers in Haryana, so we are not facing any shortage of supply whatsoever.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/prices-of-vegetables-to-shoot-up-as-mandis-at-khandsa-farrukhnagar-and-pataudi-shut/story-dZipw7YqLJgdBuPCafAF1O.html

05-05-2020||City||Turned back from Haryana border, migrant families return to Zirakpur village only to be refused entry||With a hope to get back home, a group of migrant labourers including women and children had left Phabat village but were compelled to return from the Punjab–Haryana border as they were not allowed to cross over.Seven-month pregnant Ridhima carrying her two-year-old walked 34 km (17 km on each side) to village Phabat late on Monday night, only to be told they could not enter the village.She is among 40 such migrants, rendered jobless, who had to return from Jhermeri border of Punjab–Haryana after Haryana police denied them entry. They had used cycles and prams to walk 17km to reach Jhermeri in hope of crossing over to reach home in Uttar Pradesh. They had walked along the railway track to reach the border but CRPF deployed by Haryana police sent them back.“We walked a bit, then rested a bit. Can’t walk for long in this condition,” said Ridhima, whose major worry is to feed her child. She is among six women who are pregnant.“I had thought we would go back home, so she could deliver the child there. Now we have no money or ration,” said Kallu, Ridhima husband, who is a daily wager and currently jobless. He underwent a stomach surgery only recently and his stitches were removed about 15 days ago. “We are helpless. We could have gone home and done farm work to feed ourselves,” he added, saying they are a family of 12.“We had left the village to go home, but now we have lost the roof over our heads,” said Shripal, another daily wager who along with his family came back.The migrants stayed for about two days at the border where they were medically examined and provided food and water.“We kept pleading with them (Haryana police) to let us go but they didn’t pay heed,” said Malti, a mother of three.To check the spread of the epidemic, states have sealed their borders. To cross over to Haryana, these migrants were expected to hand over a copy of their Aadhaar card with all details of their names and address. But none of them had an Aadhaar card or a curfew pass so they were not allowed to cross over.The villagers have given a written complaint to Dera Bassi SDM Kuldeep Bawa; naib tehsildar Varinder Singh Dhoot; Zirakpur SHO Gurwant Singh; and Dhakoli SMO Pommy Chatrath.The villagers refused to let them enter as they had left without informing anyone on May 2, and now fear they might bring infection to the village. “We are sending back all the families to their hutments where they were living where they will be home-quarantined for next two weeks. They were examined at the border itself and we will provide them with food,” said Kuldeep Bawa, SDM of Dera Bassi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/turned-back-from-haryana-border-migrant-families-return-to-zirakpur-village-only-to-be-refused-entry/story-jTq0D4UhGex4Tmt3BTqjPJ.html
05-05-2020||Mumbai||State department nod to transport SSC, HSC answer sheets||To ensure the timely declaration of SSC and HSC results, the state education department has now issued guidelines for allowing the movement of staff for transporting the answer papers of students from one place to another.Citing a Supreme Court order which makes it mandatory for the department to release results of SSC and HSC by June 10, the department has granted special permission for its workers, teachers and school staff to work even as the state is under lockdown. “In a case where the papers are in schools or custody, they can be transported to the examiners and they can evaluate them. Further, these evaluated papers can be sent for moderation to the moderators through staff which is deployed for the purpose,” reads the circular issued by the department to all municipal commissioners and district collectors.Nearly 15 lakh students appear the SSC exams from the state of which 3.5 lakh are from the Mumbai division which also includes Thane, Raigad and Palghar. While Raigad is in Orange zone as per the state government’s official list, the other areas are in the red zone. The board is hoping that once permissions are in place, evaluation of answer papers can take place soon and results can be declared in time. The state board usually declares Class 12 results in the last week of May and Class 10 results are out by the second week of June.“Teachers and other staff can use their vehicles for the task or can use hired vehicles provided to them. Similarly, the staff of the board can also travel to investigate the cases of malpractices that have been reported during the board exam,” it further reads.Uday Nare, a teacher at Hansraj Morarji School in Andheri said that the decision should have been taken earlier. “Now teachers would have to race against time to complete evaluation. Nevertheless, the board should now announce the marking formula for the last Geography exam which was cancelled due to the situation,” he added.HSC exams took place between February 18 and March 18, 2020, while SSC exams took place between March 3 and March 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-department-nod-to-transport-ssc-hsc-answer-sheets/story-tUImM0LppbwebzOEkVDdrJ.html
05-05-2020||Chandigarh||Animal lovers come to the rescue of Shimla’s stray dogs amid lockdown||The shutting down of eateries and dhabas has left Shimla’s stray animals in the lurch with a majority of street dogs losing their sole source of food. However, thanks to animal lovers who decided to do their bit as street dogs in most parts of the city are now being adopted.Stray dogs wandering in search of food had raised serious concern for the municipal corporation in Shimla town. This encouraged the residents to adopt more street dogs.Shimla rural legislator Vikramaditya Singh, son of former chief minister Virbhadra Singh joined the list as he adopted two stray dogs. Shimla Beopar Mandal has adopted 70 dogs roaming on Mall Road and Lower Bazaar under the community adopting scheme. “In this difficult time, it is the duty of every citizen to take care of stray dogs. We are also encouraging traders to adopt more stray dogs” said Shimla Beopar Mandal President Inderjit Singh.In the wake of an increasing population of stray dogs, Shimla MC had launched “Street Dog Adoption and Management Programme”, offering incentives such as garbage collection fee and parking fee exemption to those who would adopt a dog from the street.So far nearly 155 dogs have been adopted in Shimla town. The programme was conceived by MC commissioner Pankaj Rai who got the cue from his visit to the United States last year. “We will keep appealing the residents and MC councilors to adopt more and more street dogs, “ said Neeraj Mohan, Veterinary Public Health Officer. According to MC estimates, there are around 2,000 stray dogs within the municipal limits of Shimla.Rohit Jamwal, director of elementary education adopted six stray dogs. Jamwal himself has remained a municipal commissioner.To make the scheme foolproof, those who adopt a stray dog will also have to ensure that the dogs are given adequate medical care, support and life conditions. If found lacking on any of the fronts, they would be slapped with a fine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/animal-lovers-come-to-the-rescue-of-shimla-s-stray-dogs-amid-lockdown/story-dHHyR1pI0I24KXTKyVko8N.html
05-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh, get ready to pay more for liquor, petrol||Get ready to shell out more money for liquor and fuel in the union territory of Chandigarh.The UT administration is actively considering levying additional cess on liquor, petrol and diesel for revenue generation. A decision in this regard was taken during the daily review meeting held under Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Tuesday.A senior UT officer said, “Revenue generation has been hit hard amid the epidemic. We are mulling over imposing additional cess on liquor, diesel and petrol to generate revenue. The finance department has been asked to work out details for imposing this additional cess.”Notably, petrol in Chandigarh costs ₹65.82 per litre while diesel costs ₹59.30 per litre.Confirming the decision, Ajoy Kumar Sinha, UT’s finance secretary, said that keeping in view the reduced sources of revenue, some additional cess could be considered. The decision on the rate of cess is also under consideration.To generate revenue, the Delhi government has imposed a 70 percent “special corona fee” on sale of liquor besides raising the value added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel. Haryana, too, has hiked VAT on fuel.Meanwhile, there was marked fall in people queuing up outside liquor vends on Tuesday from Monday night itself. Long winding queues could be seen outside liquor shops on Monday, which opened after 41 days when the administration eased Covid-19 restrictions from Monday.The serpentine queues at most vends, at some places more than a 100 people at a time on Monday, trickled down to smaller queues with a handful of people on Tuesday.On Sunday, the Chandigarh administration had allowed shops selling non-essential items, including liquor, to open. The vends are to open according to the odd-even formula, with odd numbered stores to open on odd dates, and even numbered stores on even days. Liquor vends on roads dividing sectors, as well as those in the six containment zones, are to remain closed.Of the 75 licensed vends, 30 were open on Tuesday. Shopkeepers had to ensure that not more than five persons be present at a time in the shop, with timings fixed from 10 am to 6 pm.The liquor shops had closed after curfew was imposed in the city on March 24 to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the city.Keeping in view the heavy rush of customers at book shops, the UT administration decided to exempt them from the odd-even stipulation and allow them to open on all days. This will help reduce congestion at the stores.The UT administrator has also directed that discount and concession available to consumers for timely payment of property tax, water bills etc. should not be denied and last date of payment be extended accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-get-ready-to-pay-more-for-liquor-petrol/story-uBtMB5Zjo3ekMuqqTyl7UI.html
05-05-2020||Gurugram||Liquor sale in Gurugram to start from Wednesday, Haryana imposes cess||Around 218 liquor shops located in Gururgam will open on Wednesday, after the state government on Tuesday announced a series of relaxations, following the implementation of Lockdown 3.0 in the district. The government has imposed a variable Covid cess on liquor items to support areas and institutions, which have been adversely hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.The state government is also analysing the experience of other states that had opened liquor vends on Monday. Haryana has been suffering average monthly revenue loss of ₹3,00 crore due to the ongoing lockdown to check the spread of Covid-19, said officials.The state excise officials said they have sent a list of liquor vends that can allowed to be open following the issuance of the safety guidelines by the ministry of home affairs (MHA).The decision was taken after the deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who holds the additional portfolios of excise and taxation, held a meeting in Chandigarh and ordered all the taxation commissioners (DETCs) of the state to get the liquor vends open by the morning of May 6. It was also decided that the vends would allowed to be open between 7am and 7pm daily.“We have also sought a report from the deputy commissioners on whether the vends should be opened or not as Covid-19 situation varies from one district to another,” said Chautala, adding that beer bottles will attract a corona cess between ₹2 each on a pint, a can, and a 650ml bottle. On Indian-made foreign liquor(IMFL) bottles, the cess will be anywhere between ₹4 and ₹10 and for imported foreign liquor(IFL) ₹20 per bottle will be charged,” he said.H C Dahiya, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (west), said that the state has imposed the Covid cess on the sale of liquor from both wholesalers as well as retail outlets across the city. “Further, only liquor vends have been granted permission to open. The ahatas, also known as anukat kash, are not allowed to start their operations until further orders. It would be the responsibility of the licensee to ensure that no liquor is consumed in and around his retail outlet. Otherwise, the licence to run the liquor vend will be cancelled,” he said.Officials said, as per the order, no crowding at the sales counter shall be tolerated by the district administration.A distance of at least six feet shall be maintained by the customers under all circumstances and only five customers at a time will be allowed to stand at the sales counter of the retail liquor vend.Aruna Singh, DETC (east), said that they have formed teams, who will be deployed at all the liquor vends and will ensure that no one violates the rules and regulations. “ They have been instructed to ensure that proper demarcation is maintained outside the shops and to check if face masks and hand sanitisers are placed at the counters,” she said.Officials said except for those in the containment zones, all liquor shops will be operational.Muhammad Akil, Gurugram police commissioner said, that they have deployed teams across the city to monitor liquor vends. “Teams have been assigned the task to ensure that demarcation for social distancing is carried out on Tuesday night and to check if each person is wearing a face mask and using hand sanitisers before entering the shops,” he said.Akil said he has also directed the police team to set up a barricade at least 100 metres before the liquor shops so that the situation can be controlled if there is overcrowding.“We have asked the excise officials to deploy one of their officials at each liquor shop to control the crowd. Anyone found violating the rules and regulations will be booked under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code(IPC) and we will ask for the cancellation of their licences,” said Akil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/liquor-sale-in-gurugram-to-start-from-wednesday-haryana-imposes-cess/story-F9YQ8l3hJMarGwNz3VNjRP.html
05-05-2020||Gurugram||Three more Covid cases, count now 87; health team to trace Khandsa Mandi trail||Three more cases of the Coronavirus disease were confirmed on Tuesday from Sector 18, Islampur and Surat Nagar; all had contact with those who have earlier tested positive for the highly contagious Covid-19. The tally of infected persons in the district was 87, of whom 51 have recovered and 36 were being treated in hospitals. With fresh cases emerging from high-risk and high-contact areas, such as hospitals and vegetable markets, district administration is focussing on tracing the contacts of the positive individuals to ensure the virus, Sars-CoV-2, does not spread as some economic activity has resumed in the district. Tuesday’s list includes a 22-year-old man from Islampur, whose parents had contracted Covid-19 and a resident of Sector 18, whose roommate tested positive in Panipat. “A Class-IV employee at the Primary Health Centre from Surat Nagar also tested positive. We are doing her contact tracing,” chief medical officer Dr Jaswant Singh Punia said. THE KHANDSA TRAILThe district health department on Tuesday said more people from Khandsa mandi are likely to be confirmed coronavirus (Covid-19) positive. The team plans to take up the humungous exercise of tracing hawkers who purchased vegetables from the nine vegetable sellers who tested positive on Monday. Dr Punia said test results of 71 vegetable sellers of Khandsa are awaited.Nine vegetable sellers and wholesale dealers at Khandsa Mandi were confirmed Covid-19 positive on Monday. Of these, seven had come in contact with Covid-19 cases from Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi and two had come in contact with people in Nasik and West Bengal. The cases came into light when the health team conducted targeted sampling of people in the mandi last week. Sampling was done after cases surfaced in Jhajjar and Sonepat with links to Azadpur Mandi—Asia’s largest wholesale market of fruits and vegetables in Delhi which has reported 17 Covid-19 cases till now. The district health team then screened at least 1,600 people and took samples of 128 people.“Samples of over 35 people, in contact with nine vegetable sellers of Khandsa Mandi, have been sent for RT-PCR testing,” Dr Punia said. Gauging the seriousness of the situations, Dr Punia said they will prepare a list of vegetable hawkers who were in contact with the sellers and dealers who tested positive. “A list of such hawkers will be prepared. Their samples will be collected,” Dr Punia said, adding that random sampling of people would be done in areas where these hawkers have sold vegetables.“Since Gurugram is a big city it will take time to prepare the complete list of such hawkers based on the information provided by the sellers at Khandsa Mandi. They will be traced and their samples will be taken. To check infection whether the disease has spread to areas where they sold fruits and vegetables, we will do random sampling,” he said, adding that the health team will take help from MCG councilors in reaching out to people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-more-covid-cases-count-now-87-health-team-to-trace-khandsa-mandi-trail/story-7KXTIDWkgcFdRaQEH7iPwN.html

05-05-2020||City||Delhi High Court asks govt to de-seal two Apeejay schools||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Tuesday set aside a Delhi government order sealing two branches of the Apeejay School. Directing that both premises be de-sealed immediately, the court said the schools were not given a show-cause notice, or any opportunity of being heard.Two branches of Apeejay School — Saket and Sheikh Sarai — were sealed by the Delhi government’s education department on Monday for charging hiked fees from students in violation of the directions issued by its orders. The action was taken under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, enforced in the city amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva said the sealing cannot be “sustained” because the schools were not heard but did not comment on the orders of registration of an FIR.The court said the Directorate of Education (DoE) is permitted to issue a show-cause notice to the school, which will file a response to the notice within a week. The judge said the DoE shall fix an appropriate date of hearing before the competent authority, which would pass an order in accordance with law.While officials at the DoE refused to comment and said “they are examining the order”, the Apeejay Schools issued a statement welcoming the court’s decision. “We are following all government norms as applicable. Education should be a partnership, not an adversarial political ploy. We continue to have faith in the law, and will work closely with visionary government leaders,” the statement read.“Since no show cause notice or opportunity of hearing was given to the petitioner schools before sealing of their premises, the impugned action of sealing cannot be sustained,” the court said in its order.The court however, clarified, that it has neither considered nor commented upon the merits of the contentions of either party and the DoE is at liberty to take appropriate action in accordance with law, if so warranted, after granting an opportunity of hearing to the petitioners.Appearing for the school, senior advocate HL Tikku, told the court that school has complied with all the directions issued by the DoE, however, in so far as the fee hike is concerned, the same was enhanced for the year 2019 – 2020. Since, this was not permitted by the DoE, a plea had been filed in the court which is pending adjudication.He also contended that no show cause notice or an opportunity of hearing was granted to the petitioners prior to the passing of the order of sealing of the school premises and of sealing the schools.Following this, the court said that it is an admitted position that after April 11 and April 18, no show cause notice has given to the school to explain their position and no opportunity has been given to them to show that it had complied with the directions contained in those orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-high-court-asks-govt-to-de-seal-two-apeejay-schools/story-TQWwOPJSnsWwuPEJ4MJxtK.html

05-05-2020||City||Punjab: Cong MLA sparks row as audio demanding ‘courtesy call’ from SHO hits internet||Congress MLA from Patti Harminder Singh Gill sparked controversy on Tuesday after an audio clip of him allegedly threatening a newly-appointed SHO for not paying him a courtesy visit surfaced on the internet.This has come at a time when the whole country is expressing gratitude towards the police force for combating Covid-19 on the frontlines.As per the unverified audio clip, which is spreading rapidly on social media platforms, the MLA is talking to Harike police SHO sub-inspector Navdeep Singh in a rude and haughty manner.The call recording begins with Gill’s personal assistant making the cop aware that the MLA was on the line. “Since when have you been posted here,” Gill asks, to which the SHO says, “Sir, a day before yesterday.”“Don’t you know there is an MLA in Patti constituency to whom you need to make a call,” Gill questions Singh, who replies, “I had taken permission from the sir (seems the SSP).”To this, Gill says, “Listen to me for a minute my young brother, MLAs have some powers. We are not imbeciles who will sit back and watch SHO or munshis take charge here...How will you do your ‘SHOship’ without talking to the MLA? Did you make a courtesy call to me? Did I go to Pakistan? How many MLAs are in Patti constituency? Have you fallen from the sky? Have you become the god?........You talk to your SSP. Is MLA not important to you?” Gill continues.He further says, “Whenever a cop does his work, you stop him. I asked police officer Kulbir Singh for some work, but you have resisted him. Why you have stopped him?”When the SHO said he was unaware of this, Gill is heard saying in a threatening tone, “No issues. You will get the knowledge soon.” Before the call is disconnected, the SHO says “sorry” to the MLA.On Tuesday, Gill took to Facebook to post a clarification on the audio recording. He also demanded action against the SHO for sharing the audio clip online. “If I have uttered anything wrong in the recording, action should be taken against me as per the law. And if the SHO has violated his duty, appropriate step should be taken against him,” he posted on his Facebook page.However, he later deleted the post and shared a new one which read, “I am a disciplined sepoy of the Congress party. The matter has reached the CM house. On the CM’s direction, I am deleting all my posts regarding the matter from Facebook.”Justifying his stand, Gill told HT that he wanted to leave no communication gap between the administration and a public representative. “If I seem to have talked rudely, I feel for it. But I didn’t give him any threats,” he said adding that the SHO had illegally shared the call recording on social media, using fake IDs.The SHO could not be contacted despite repeated attempts. Also, no senior district police official was willing to comment on the issue.Meanwhile, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) district president Virsa Singh Valtoha has demanded an FIR against the MLA for threatening a government official.AAP SEEKS LEGAL ACTION AGAINST CONG MLAThe Punjab unit of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday sought registration of a case against the Congress MLA from Patti, Harminder Singh Gill, for insulting and threatening the station house officer of Harike Pattan police station.In a joint statement issued from party headquarters Tuesday, AAP’s state unit president Bhagwant Mann and leader of opposition (LoP) Harpal Singh Cheema also demanded Gill’s immediate expulsion from the Congress obstructing and threatening a public servant. They said that Gill’s actions were a reflection of how some ruling party leaders, MLAs and ministers were browbeating officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-cong-mla-sparks-row-as-audio-demanding-courtesy-call-from-sho-hits-internet/story-x7Op6Kn9wky7ftItPCRMbK.html

Director of health services Dr G Dewan said examining birth and death data is not a routine practice; but owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, a check is being kept on the trend. He said data of non-Covid deaths in March showed no unusual trend. “In fact, number of deaths had gone down due to various reasons, including dip in accidents.” “If a category has seen hike in deaths in April, we will get the trend examined, and check the cause,” he said.  Dr Dewan said that the cause of death is mentioned in every death form and this file is maintained by the MC. “I will get all forms collected and check if there are deaths caused by respiratory disease or chest pain, which are symptoms of Covid-19 . Accordingly, we will see if there need for further examination,” he added.As per sources, PGIMER is already testing non-Covid deaths who had symptoms of the infection. Sources added they have sampled five cases which have all tested negative. Will share data: MC MC’s medical officer health (MoH) Dr Amrit Warring, who is also the deputy registrar of death and birth control, said data has been compiled after obtaining figures from all crematoriums in the city. “There seems to be no unusual trend in non-Covid deaths. But, health authorities can analyse it better. We will share whatever is available with us,” he added. In March, number of deaths reported were 219 against 271 reported during the corresponding time period last year. Meanwhile, in January, 331 deaths were reported against 311 last year, while 237 deaths in February against 263 during the corresponding time period for last year. In April 2020, four deaths were recorded in the age group of one to 20, while 11 deaths were reported in 2019. In the age group of 20 to 40, 15 deaths were reported in April 2020 while 35 were reported in 2019 for the time period.In the age group of 40 to 60, 51 deaths were recorded in April 2020, while 41 were recorded in 2019 for the corresponding time period.

05-05-2020||Delhi||Shelter home caretaker tests positive, inmates demand screening for all, many suffer from comorbidities||A day after a 32-year-old caretaker of a shelter in central Delhi’s Jhandewalan area tested positive for Covid-19, occupants of four such homes run by an NGO in the area said on Tuesday that all of them should be screened for the infection. According to officials, there are 56 inmates at the shelter whose caretaker tested positive and 206 in the entire cluster. The NGO working for the homeless wrote to the central Delhi district magistrate and other authorities, urging them to test all caretakers and occupants of all shelters in the city as they share community toilets and other facilities. Besides the 223 regular shelter homes for the homeless—115 of them are portacabins, 11 are buildings and 19 are tents—the government has converted 256 school buildings into shelters for migrant workers stranded in the city due to the lockdown. According to officials, there are a total 3,725 inmates at all the shelters across the city.“The caretaker was responsible for shelter number 14 and was working day and night to provide food and other forms of assistance to occupants,” Sunil Kumar Aledia, a social activist working for the homeless and founder of Centre for Holistic Development, wrote in a letter to the DM. Aledia said any delay in providing medical care to these homeless persons would put their lives at risk as well as others who may come in contact with them at community toilets, ration shops, pharmacies and other such places. According to district health officials, on April 27, the caretaker had complained of body ache and was taken to Lady Hardinge Hospital where his sample was sent for testing. On May 1, his test report confirmed him positive but he could go to collect the report only on May 4. He has been transferred to a quarantine facility in AIIMS Jhajjar. Nidhi Srivastava, DM (central) said, “We got to know about the caretaker testing positive late Monday night. We have started screening occupants with symptoms at the cluster of shelters at Jhandewalan. We had been carrying out selective screening earlier also, and will extend the exercise to other shelters in the district.” Several homeless persons at these shelters, including the elderly, are already suffering from ailments such as TB, HIV, as well as withdrawal symptoms from lack of substance abuse amid the lockdown. “The inmates have, on several occasions, complained of fever, sore throat and dehydration besides their long-standing ailments but their Covid tests have not been conducted. Even if one of them has the infection, it can spread to so many others who are housed with them or the staff working in the shelters. The government must understand the seriousness of the issue and test all these people,” Aledia said. Bipin Rai, member, Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), the nodal agency for making arrangements of stay for the homeless in the city, said he is aware of the case and plans to prioritise batches of people for treatment based on where symptoms are being reported. “We will start with the areas where the need for testing is higher. The district health teams have been already put on the task,” Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/shelter-home-caretaker-tests-positive-inmates-demand-screening-for-all-many-suffer-from-comorbidities/story-j42Gvsb7R5UWm94doPajJN.html
05-05-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Punjab slows down on testing after Nanded pilgrims’ arrival||Punjab has witnessed a sharp decline in Covid-19 testing since the return of Sikh pilgrims to Takht Hazur Sahib in Maharashtra’s Nanded more than a week ago, reveals the state health department’s daily status report. The low testing has raised eyebrows as more than 12,000 Punjabis, including nearly 4,200 Nanded devotees, who were stuck outside Punjab amid the lockdown, were allowed to enter the state since April 26 when the state government tested 1,965 samples, the highest in a day so far. On April 29, the department tested only 690 samples, the lowest in the last 10 days. On April 30, May 1, May 2, May 3 and the following day, 1,596, 936, 881, 1,094 and 1,098 samples were tested, respectively, the report says.As per the health department’s media bulletin, of the 14,228 samples collected in the state between April 26 and May 4, test reports of 11,427 have been received. This despite the fact that the government claims have a testing capacity of 2,500 samples a day while having roped in a private player, Path Labs, for the purpose five days back. Till Tuesday, the health department was able to test only 2,900 Nanded pilgrims of which 969 have turned out to be positive.“At a time when testing should have been increased manifold keeping in view the high percentage of Nanded-returned pilgrims getting infected, low testing could be a tactic not to show a sudden jump in Covid-19 cases as number of positive patients will also increase,” a senior health department official said.Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has already instructed the department to increase the testing capacity to 6,000 a day by May 15.A senior health department official said testing figures are not properly updated as the district health authorities could not give data on the samples taken by Path Labs.“Nearly 4,400 samples taken by Path Labs are not included in the data as the district authorities could not update us on this. Path Labs sends samples to Delhi and their testing takes more time than our facilities in Punjab,” said health department’s Covid-19 spokesperson Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-punjab-slows-down-on-testing-after-nanded-pilgrims-arrival/story-sa4vvR9TgVCtaBR43hyB8L.html

All families have returned from Nanded.On Sunday, the emotional reaction of parents of a 3-year-old girl moved the authorities to allow both the father and mother to stay with her. The family, along with 10 other members, had been quarantined at Mai Bhago College. Another family from Rataul village was also allowed this. “The test reports of my wife, my 11-year-old son, my younger brother and his 2-year-old daughter came on Sunday. Barring my son, all were negative. My wife has been staying with my son in the hospital,” said the 40-year-old father. Another six-year-old boy was tested positive on Sunday, but his father, mother and a younger daughter (3-year-old) tested negative. The family is staying put at the hospital.Another 4-year-old girl, who along with her grandparents, had returned from Nanded, has tested positive. “My 60-year-old wife has been living with her in the isolation ward,” said the grandfather. The fifth case is of another 11-year-old boy from Khemkaran village, who tested positive on April 30; his mother is staying with her. Tarn Taran civil surgeon Dr Anoop Kumar said it was a challenge to isolate the kids, but in all such cases, a separate room had been provided. “There is, of course, the increased chance of infection, but the 11-year-old had threatened to commit suicide. Parents have been advised to always wear masks. All such persons will be retested once their children get cured.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/parents-allowed-to-stay-with-covid-positive-kids-in-hospital-in-tarn-taran/story-fYLSSbRtCvhNpMxubb7ocK.html
05-05-2020||City||Gear up to handle influx of NRIs, stranded persons: Punjab CM||As a number of NRIs and stranded people from across the country are expected to reach Punjab in the coming days, chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday issued a series of directives, including strict orders to the health department to ensure mandatory screening of all such returnees, to check the spread of Covid-19, with institutional quarantine for those coming back from high-risk regions of India, and hotel/home quarantine for the NRIs.The state government has also decided to rope in universities and state-run labs. The chief minister has sanctioned an immediate amount of ₹12 crore for equipment and operational expense for 6 such institutions—Regional Disease Diagnostic Lab (RDDL), North Zone Jalandhar; GADVASU, Ludhiana; Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar; Punjabi University, Patiala; Punjab Biotech Incubator, Mohali, and Punjab Forensic Lab, Mohali.The CM also directed the DCs to prepare a list of private hotels that can be utilised for paid quarantine, while asking the health department to make an inventory of functional/non-functional private hospitals. The decisions were announced during a video conference held by the chief minister with the health and medical experts. During the meeting, Captain also ordered an immediate readiness audit of level 1 and 2 facilities, pointing out that as of now, 21,000 Punjabis settled abroad want to return home. He also directed the expert committee to formulate its guidelines and protocols and not take any chance.Stating that he does not believe in the reliability of the certificates that the respective nations would give to the returnees, Amarinder said the NRIs should be given the options for quarantine, on payment basis, in hotels and at home, under supervision, pending testing, which should be done within 4-5 days of arrival.On those coming from within the country, the chief minister said given the Maharashtra (Nanded) experience, wherein 27% of the 1000 Punjabis who had returned so far had already shown positive results, the state government would take no chances. All such returnees would have to be quarantined in state centres, he added.Earlier in his detailed presentation, Dr KK Talwar underlined the need for RT-PCR testing of all those returning from red zones around the country. If positive, they should be shifted to Level 1, 2 or 3 healthcare facilities as per the clinical status, and if negative, they should be strictly home quarantined for 14 days, put on COVA app, and follow-ups be done by health teams, Talwar said.Additional chief secretary, industries, Vini Mahajan said Punjab would be the first state to adopt a “scientific strategy” for viral load testing, going beyond ICMR guidelines. The Centre for Policy Research (CPR), in association with various US and Indian universities, had come out with a comprehensive plan for such testing, she said, adding that experts from Johns Hopkins University will be providing guidance on this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gear-up-to-handle-influx-of-nris-stranded-persons-punjab-cm/story-OPA4ko9CyiYmLLqblv7MPM.html

05-05-2020||Chandigarh||91% of Covid patients who died in Punjab had chronic health issues||A total of 91% of coronavirus patients who died in Punjab had at least one other major chronic health condition, revealed an analysis of Covid-19 deaths carried out by the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) and the state health department.The most common medical conditions behind the infection-related fatalities in the state were hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These underlying medical ailments are being considered as high-risk factors for infected persons the world over, particularly in the United States, which is the worst-affected country.There have been 26 Covid-19 fatalities in Punjab which had a death rate (deaths as a percentage of those who tested positive) of 7%, the highest in the country, until a week ago but it has dropped to below 2% now following a sharp spike in the count of coronavirus positive cases. And, most of those who died had at least one or more comorbidity, meaning they had at least one other chronic disease in addition to Covid-19.Of them, 58% had either diabetes or hypertension as a chronic health condition whereas 9% had heart disease and 6% were suffering from bronchitis. Asthma, obesity, HIV, pneumonia and rheumatoid arthritis were the other underlying illnesses that increased their risk. Only 9% of Covid-19 patients who died had no comorbidity, according to the analysis of deaths till May 2.Former director of the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, Dr KK Talwar said patients with comorbidity were much more vulnerable than others because these underlying medical ailments could be a precipitating factor and increase the risk substantially.“My advice to people with serious chronic diseases will be that they take their medicines regularly and not be casual about it. They need to keep their blood pressure, diabetes or cardiac status under control by medication they are taking. Second, they should avoid exposure,” he said on the precautions vulnerable people need to take to protect themselves.THOSE IN THEIR 50s AMONG WORST-HITAn analysis of age-wise spread and death rate as of May 2 shows that people in their 50s are among those worst-hit by the pandemic in Punjab. Of the people infected with coronavirus, 19% are in this age group and face the highest risk as 38% of those who died in Punjab due to the virus were aged between 50 and 59. Another equally vulnerable lot is persons above 60 years who account for 16% of coronavirus cases and 43% deaths. Also, two in three, or say 67%, persons infected with Covid-19 in the state belong to the active working population between the age of 21 and 60. Of these, 33% are aged between 21 and 40 and the remaining 34% in the 41 to 60 age-group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/91-of-covid-patients-who-died-in-punjab-had-chronic-health-issues/story-bUWejAIn7GYzIX4llbRegM.html

However, he is asymptomatic, police said.The SSP said there was no clarity on the source of infection. However, sources said Bhagwanpuria most probably got infected in Patiala jail from where he was brought on production warrant to Batala on April 30.Civil surgeon Dr Kisan Chand said, “Police brought him for the test. We can’t say anything about the source and police are investigating.”A list of Bhagwanpuria’s direct and indirect contacts has been prepared. On the list are the names of several police personnel, including SP, DSP-rank officers, who have been quarantined. Their samples have also been collected for test. Bhagwanpuria was in police remand at the Civil Lines station.“As his remand ends today, he will be produced before a court on Wednesday and isolated in the hospital as per the advice of health officials,” said the SSP.It’s a conspiracy: MotherBhagwanpuria’s mother Harjit Kaur rushed to the police station and accused the cops of “hatching a conspiracy to eliminate him”. She sat on dharna outside the police station.Terming the allegations baseless, Batala SP (headquarter) Jasbir Singh Rai said, “His report is a concern for us as well because many of our colleagues came in contact with him. So far, 40 police personnel who come in his contact have been identified.”Judge, court staff opt for self quarantineHarsimrandeep Kaur, the civil judge in whose court the gangster was produced twice, through a letter told her seniors that she, her parents and five staffers of her court would observe 14-day self-quarantine in interest of public health.Facing 59 casesBhagwanpuria has 59 cases of murder, robbery, dacoity and snatching against him in various police stations of Punjab. Officials say his crime record is the worst in the state.A native of Bhagwanpur village in Batala, Bhagwanpuria was a petty chain snatcher till 2011. The Tarn Taran police booked him for running a heroin smuggling racket from Patiala Central Jail. A recent dossier by the police’s Organised Crime Control Unit (OCCU) says that the jailed gangster has 33 accomplices in and outside Punjab who take orders from him. Most of his accomplices are active in Tarn Taran, Amritsar and Gurdaspur districts.Patiala jail put on alertThe Patiala central jail has been put on alert after Bhagwanpuria was detected positive for Covid-19.

05-05-2020||City||Nitish briefs Opposition of govt’s action plan to deal with pandemic||PATNA: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar on Tuesday apprised the legislature party leaders of the Opposition parties, including Congress, RJD, HAM-S and CPI-ML, of the Bihar government’s efforts in tackling Covid-19 pandemic, assistance to the poor and the arrangements following the return of thousands of migrants from different states, while seeking their cooperation.Bihar Legislative Assembly speaker Vijay Kumar Chaudhary had convened the meeting of all the Legislature party leaders from wherever they were at the behest of the CM to discuss the situation in the wake of the pandemic.This was the first opportunity since the premature adjournment of the Bihar Legislative Assembly on March 16 due to pandemic that the leader of the House had interacted with the Opposition leaders. Disaster management principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit and Patna commissioner Sanjay Agarwal also gave presentations on how the government was handling the pandemic, providing assistance to the needy.Kumar said that the Bihar government had stuck to Centre’s guidelines and as soon as there was nod for bringing the stranded migrants, arrangements were made. “Whoever wants to return to Bihar is welcome. We will make all arrangements. But everyone should remember that Covid-19 requires utmost precaution . Even a country like the USA is struggling,” he added.Kumar also answered Opposition’s charges as to why he was not moving around. “I am one CM who has been known for being in the midst of people, but this is no time to do that. My movement may lead to crowding and cause problems. This is the time to maintain social distancing. When the situation demands, I will certainly be out to meet people,” he added.Kumar said that Bihar government was treading cautiously as most of the infection in Bihar had come from outside. “The cases have crossed 500-mark, but it can spiral fast with slight carelessness. Panchayat representatives have been quite actively involved in creating awareness,” he said, directing the officials to tell the DMs to be in touch with the local MLAs and also provide any information the leaders of Opposition wanted.Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said that the Opposition should extend cooperation in the disbursal of ₹ 12,612-crore assistance from the Centre and state government to the needy through banks and distribution of foodgrains. “There will be no poor in the state who won’t get a minimum of ₹ 3,000 apart from foodgrains,” he added.The meeting, held through video conferencing, was significant, as the Opposition Congress and the RJD had been consistently attacking the government over the manner in which it tackled the issue of stranded migrants and students.In place of Leader of Opposition Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav, whose relentless tweets despite absence from Patna has generated a lot of heat, senior RJD leader Abdul Bari Siddiqui participated in the meeting and urged the CM to keep an eye on ‘communal virus’. “I know you are alert about it. But any room for communal virus to spread will be dangerous,” he added.Congress’s Sadanand Singh said that officials in the control rooms and administration did not pick up phones to share information. On this, the CM said that he could easily contact him or any of the ministers. Others who attended the meeting included HAM-S president and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi and CPI-ML’s Mehboob Alam||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nitish-briefs-opposition-of-govt-s-action-plan-to-deal-with-pandemic/story-jfoCC5R2xOUrNctYH99KIM.html

05-05-2020||City||Not ready to wait, anxious Bihar migrants continue to walk back home||Despite trains bringing back thousands of stranded migrant labourers from different states, not all of them are ready to wait for their turn.An early morning visit to Gopalganj border,connecting Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, reveals the endless queue of migrants on the way to their native places. Men, women and children with their belongings are on the move, come rain or shine.On Tuesday by 9am, thousands of people from places like Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi arrived on the Gopalganj border on foot, carts, taxis — anything they could manage. As many as 20 counters were set up for labourers to undergo thermal screening and get registered.Mohammad Jabbar, 24, a native of Khagaria district, who is differently-abled, came on his tricycle from Delhi. Jabbar started his journey on April 23. He used to work in a fish market at Gazipur on Delhi border. “It was tiring. I left Delhi as I had no other option left,” he said, adding, “I used to cover over 50km every day and took a painkiller during the drive.” His is not the only case. Md Armaan left from Jaipur for Araria with 80 people on April 1.“All of us used to work together in a stitching unit, which supplied garments to a foreign company, but everything stopped after lockdown. We were unable to sustain ourselves there without money. The landlord asked for rent and disconnected power and water supply when we failed to pay the same” he added.Supaul resident Mohammad Iqbal left from Alwar in Rajasthan with 26 others. “Without work, there was no point in staying there,” Iqbal said.Meanwhile, many labourers rued that they did not receive the ₹1,000 assistance in their bank accounts that the Bihar government had announced. Labourers Rekha Kumari, Rabita Kumari, both residents of Champaran said only a few of them were able to avail the cash assistance announced by the state government. “We failed to register and gave up after two or three attempts,” said Chandan Kumar, adding, that only those workers were able to avail ₹1,000 who have bank account in Bihar.Meanwhile, a group of 40 students on the way to Saharsa from Madhya Pradesh reached Gopalganj by a taxi, paying ₹55,000. One of the students pleading anonymity said they just ate biscuits during the travel. “In the name of health check- up, we were only thermally screened. We were not given any certificates,” said another student.In another case, Rohit Kumar of Purnea said that he along with eight others moved from Bareilly on April 1 and reached here late on Monday night.The wait for another group, comprising of 73 people is getting longer since there is no vehicle to take them to West Bengal from the border area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/not-ready-to-wait-anxious-bihar-migrants-continue-to-walk-back-home/story-7f4rHoPmbVZ28yNeM1GANJ.html

The government has intimated an exercise of issuing slips to the beneficiaries to maintain social distancing. Once the slips are collected, the food materials are delivered at the doorsteps by the government workers.On Monday, Debo, wife of Daulati Ram, a Punjab Police home guard posted at Kapurthala headquarters, along with her two sons—Bholu, Joban— and their friend Arjun Kumar thrashed Lahori after he refused to issue them slips citing that they do not have their names registered as beneficiaries in the list provided by the F&C department, a police officer said.“Locals and nephew of the deceased rushed Lahori to Kapurthala civil hospital, where the doctors declared him brought dead. We have registered a case against the four on the statements given by Lahori’s family,” superintendent of police (Investigation) Manpreet Singh said.Dr Sandeep Dhawan of the civil hospital said that the preliminary reports suggest that the victim died of a cardiac arrest, however, the exact cause of death will be ascertained after post-mortem report.A case under Sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered against the accused at City Kapurthala police station, the SP said.This was second murder in Kapurthala district in three days.

05-05-2020||Chandigarh||No point in shifting seat of power every 6 months: J&K HC to Centre, admn||The Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Tuesday observed that there were no sufficient and logical reasons to justify shifting of seat of power, called Darbar Move, every six months between Jammu and Srinagar.With these observations Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Rajnesh Oswal placed the matter before the secretary, Union ministry of home affairs, and chief secretary of Jammu and Kashmir Union territory.They left it on the constitutional authorities to take the final call.The “archaic and obsolete” practice started by the erstwhile Dogra rulers of the princely state around 1872 had been causing a whopping loss of Rs 200 crore to the state exchequer every year. Taking suo-motu cognisance of a PIL, the division bench observed, “We have also noted above the limitations on the extent of our jurisdiction whereby we stand precluded from making a declaration on the permissibility or the continuation of the practice of the Darbar Move. We defer this task to the best wisdom of those on whom the Constitution of India bestows this solemn duty keeping in view the interest of the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, the larger interest of its people and the mandate of the Constitution of India.”The high court, after a marathon hearing, observed that “no reasons or grounds are forthcoming for enabling and supporting considerations of administrative efficiency, legal justification or constitutional basis for affecting the Darbar Move”.“Regions of both Jammu and Srinagar equally require administration and governance round the year without interruption. It is unfair and opposed to public interest to deprive either region completely of access to government machinery for six months at a time,” the court said.It also questioned the annual expenditure of Rs 200 crore to sustain and perpetuate an arrangement of biannual shifting of its capital in a ‘hopelessly fiscally deprived’ UT with severe underdevelopment.‘Darbar Move does not hold weight today’After citing facts and figures supported by logical conclusions, the division bench observed that the “practice of Darbar Move does not hold weight today. This justification of the Darbar Move has lost all relevance”. “Jammu and Kashmir are already suffering from high fiscal deficit and the expenditure on the Darbar Move is an unwarranted burden on the depleted resources of the Union territory,” the bench stated.It also observed that the practice results in “wastage of tremendous amount of time, efforts and energy on inefficient and unnecessary activity” and hence rationalisation of the Darbar Move was urgently required. ‘It all started amid Covid lockdown’Advocate Monika Kohli, amicus appointed in the case, said, “It all started amid Covid lockdown after a man from Kashmir whose son was stranded in Iran moved an application before the court for his evacuation and it was treated as suo-motu PIL”. “While all this was on, the administration announced Darbar Move in April. Some of the lawyers from Kashmir expressed their concern that how Darbar Move can happen amid lockdown,” she said.“Subsequently, it was brought into the notice of the HC, which wanted to know if it (Darbar Move) was legally required and mandatory or just a practice, and also sought reports from various departments on the money spent on this exercise,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-point-in-shifting-seat-of-power-every-6-months-j-k-hc-to-centre-admn/story-vMxiw60vrmABIq29KOSiEL.html

Head constable Gagandeep Singh was originally posted at Julkan police station but he remained attached with the Sangrur DSP without any formal orders.“There was no mention of any such attachment or movement of Gagandeep in the formal registers at Julkan police station,” the SSP said.He said that a separate show-cause notice has been issued to SHO Bhinder regarding violation of orders of Punjab DGP regarding unauthorised deployment of force.“As per orders, three-month pay worth Rs 1.70 lakh of unauthorised gunman will be recovered from the SHO.

He passed the remaining white stick to the one behind him in the queue and obediently stood in his circle. They are not playing; neither the circle is on the blackboard in a classroom but on the scorching charcoal street that leads to a liquor shop in Jaipur.“One box of chalk has been consumed since morning,” said an assistant offering chalk to alcohol buyers to draw circles to stand and maintain social distancing in the ever-lengthening queue outside the liquor shop on Ajmer Road.While the teachers have grabbed mouse and keyboards as all classes are being held online, liquor buyers have the good old chalk between their fingers. “Mein to le kar hi aaya (I came with the chalk),” said another man, standing in 57th circle... a good 150 metres from the shop.The liquor shops opened on May 4 after a gap of almost 42 days of lockdown due to corona pandemic but the joy of overenthusiastic liquor buyers was short lived as they flouted the norms of social distancing and crowded at the counters. The result: within an hour of the opening of the shops, the police had to order their closure.Lessons learnt, everyone returned on Tuesday well behaved and prepared for the ‘test’. “Today we have put barricades and our assistants are moving amid queues of buyers with hand sanitisers,” said Manoj sitting at the counter of a wine shop on New Sanganer Road.Shops didn’t open till the buyers disciplined themselves. There are 206 vends in Jaipur, out of which only 140 opened on Tuesday, said district excise officer Sunil Bhati.Labourers, students, old businessmen, white-collar workers... the queue had everyone waiting since morning. Those who got the bottles could be identified not just by the sparkle in eyes but a bounce in steps and clank of invisible bottles tucked in pockets and thelas.“Hum dus mazdoor kisi tarah 500 rupya ikattha kiya,” one labourer with three tiny bottles tucked in his trousers’ waist said how he pooled money with his friends to buy wine as due to lockdown he lost his job and went without liquor for more than a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/for-liquor-in-jaipur-buyers-draw-circles-to-follow-social-distancing/story-I02XVhEtQkdLXP2AZklnoL.html

The child tested negative for the virus, however, it could not be allowed to go near the Covid-19 positive mother. The mother had come from the Khadki Bazar, said officials.Dr Aarti Kinikar, head of paediatric department at BJ Government Medical College attached with the Sassoon, said “Multiple babies benefit from the milk bank. We follow due process before accepting the milk. Consent form is filled out. There are very strict criteria’s; if the woman fits it, only then milk is accepted. The milk then undergoes various tests and procedures.” The feeding is happening through the hospital staff - nurses and doctors - with the consent of the mother and the family members, according to the District Information Office.The mother herself could not be reached for a comment as she is undergoing treatment for Covid-19. Another official from the hospital said that the bank which began operations in 2013 gets milk from patients from two other hospitals besides Sassoon. The bank collects excess milk from lactating mothers and stores it for babies who cannot have access to their mother’s milk which could happen for various reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sassoon-s-milk-bank-a-saviour-for-newborns/story-53QkuMsiok1URYfkPCMyIK.html

Reason: Nearly 60% of the labour workforce has returned to their home state.Industrialists are now grappling with labour shortage, wondering how to increase productivity at a time when there is hardly anybody around to do the work.As per Mohali Industries Association (MIA), the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector in Mohali district has suffered a loss of around ₹1,000 crore in the last 45 days, while the overall loss is estimated at ₹1,500 crore.There are around 13,000 MSME units and 49 large industrial units in Mohali that employ 1.3 lakh persons, out of which 78,000 labourers have gone back to their native states. The units in the district are located in Mohali, Dera Bassi, Chanalon in Kurali and Chappar Chiri.Yogesh Sagar, president of MIA, said, “We have already paid the salaries for April and have requested the state government to do something to stop the workers from going back.”Vivek Kapoor, vice-president of MIA, said most of the skilled workers had left and it was really difficult to restart the units. “It will at least take us one year to revive the business.”Harjinder Singh Pannu, general manager, district industry centre, said, “We are calculating the losses. For now we have only allowed those industries/establishments that can make arrangements for workers’ stay within the premises and/or in adjacent buildings, but such units are few. And the migrants have started returning home.”Since the industrial policy was revised almost two years ago, the MSMEs scheme for Mohali had been drawing big profits for the district. Major sectors like IT, agro and food processing, automobiles and auto parts, textiles, engineering, pharmaceuticals, electronics, sports, hand tools and leather industry were planning to set up base here. But the lockdown has put a damper on those plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shortage-of-workforce-puts-a-damper-on-reopening-of-industry-in-mohali/story-wA6rdlOSlk5JMdYY8ZkvZI.html
05-05-2020||Mumbai||Uran wetlands proposed as conservation reserves by forest department||Large flocks of migratory birds visiting wetlands in and around Mumbai during the Covid-19 lockdown have drawn the forest department’s attention and led to enhance protection for these ecologically sensitive zones.Alongside wetlands at Navi Mumbai (NRI Complex and TS Chanakya), the Maharashtra forest department intends on declaring three of the most threatened wetland areas in Uran – Panje, Bhendhkal, and Belpada – as conservation reserves as well. These wetlands have been marked for the Navi Mumbai Special Economic Zone (NMSEZ) — an integrated industrial township.Conservation reserves are demarcated as protected areas in buffer zones of bird migration corridors, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, or reserved and protected forests.The mangrove cell shared a letter with HT issued to the Raigad collector and City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd (Cidco) last week, seeking comments on why the Uran wetlands should get protected status. For the first time, the department denoted each site as a ‘wetland’ in the letter, irrespective of their official status.“The mangrove cell intends to propose protection and conservation measures for the said wetlands under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 (for declaration of conservation reserves) to the Maharashtra government,” the letter undersigned by Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove Cell) said, asking for comments from district and planning authorities. “The Navi Mumbai region has some important wetland habitats for a number of migratory and resident bird species but also play an important ecological role since they protect surrounding areas from flooding,” the letter stated.The letter was based on recommendations by the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) in their 2019 report on the status of coastal wetlands and water birds of Navi Mumbai. “The high numbers of flamingos congregating at TSC [TS Chanakya] and NRI Complex wetlands during the ongoing coronavirus-enforced lockdown is further evidence of the importance of these sites for threatened migratory birds,” the letter added. Unlike the two wetlands in Navi Mumbai, the Uran wetlands – spread across over 500-hectare core area for migratory bird roosting – have not had any migratory birds visiting them at all this year, especially Panje, which dried up completely due to high tide blockages during the lockdown.The Raigad district administration said it was yet to see the contents of the letter. Cidco said it did not have jurisdiction over the three wetland sites. “Large patches of land from Panje and Bhendkhal were sold by Cidco to a private company for the NMSEZ project across 1,250 hectares. Belpada falls in the jurisdiction of Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust. It is these bodies the forest department needs to approach for a no-objection certificate, and not Cidco,” said Pramod Patil, nodal officer (environment), Cidco.Certain sections of the Uran wetlands have been witnessing aggressive debris and mud dumping, blocking of high tidewater, and construction activities before and during the lockdown period. Last week, more security cabins were set up at Panje, restricting entry and exit for outsiders. “These wetlands were a destination of 1.5 lakh birds, especially flamingos, until last year but they have turned into dry patches. Not a single flamingo is spotted now as they are being forced to smaller areas such as Talawe due to overall loss of habitat along the eastern seafront,” said environmentalist BN Kumar.“Indiscriminate burial of these wetlands will lead to flooding as it had across 20 villages last monsoon.

05-05-2020||Delhi||Stuck students in dilemma: Go back home or stick to study schedules||Mukbang Pertin, 23, a civil services aspirant in Delhi from Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh, is unsure if he should think about going back home or rather stay here and focus on his studies. There is no clarity on when the next date of the exam he is preparing for will be announced after the nationwide lockdown was extended, with some relaxations, till May 17 on Friday. While many aspirants had left when the lockdown was announced initially, some like Pertin decided to stay back.As the government makes arrangements to send outstation students back home, a number of aspirants preparing for civil and state service and other competitive examinations, say they are in a fix. Most of them say that they have already registered for various examinations and going back now will only hamper their preparation and routine. Many said that had even joined online coaching classes in Delhi. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)-preliminary examination was scheduled to be held on May 31. However, on April 28, the government had announced that an in-principle decision has been taken to postpone the preliminary exam, but an official announcement will be made only after May 3. Pertin had registered for the test and was preparing for the exams.A majority of students preparing for the medical entrance exam NEET and engineering exam JEE, who were staying at hostels of their respective coaching centres, have already left. According to officials of several coaching institutes, the hostels were vacated immediately after the Delhi government issued an order on March 12. The National Testing Agency — that conducts both NEET and JEE — has already postponed the exams till further orders in view of the raging Covid-19 pandemic.“More than half the students living in rented rooms in my building had left initially. I don’t know if leaving for home now is a good idea. The government before making an announcement should come out with a clear notification of the exam schedule. It will affect our study routine. Even those who have gone back are not clear when and where the exams take place for which they have already registered,” said Pertin, who lives in a rented accommodation in Old Rajinder Nagar.A large number of students preparing for union and state board exams live in different pockets of the city — like Mukherjee Nagar, Old Rajinder Nagar, Laxmi Nagar, Munirka, Ber Sarai, Jia Sarai and Munirka — which have over the years become a hub for aspirants preparing for competitive examinations.Prasun Kumar, 25, who lives in a paying guest accommodation in Mukherjee Nagar, said that except for very pressing issues — like failure to pay rent — students wouldn’t want to go home at this time as it was a crucial moment for the upcoming exams. Kumar, who is preparing for Staff Selection Commission (SSC) exams, said that the CGL (a preliminary exam) had started around March 16 and was being held in phases. But only half the students could take the exam before it was postponed indefinitely on March 22 for the rest of the students.“The students had stayed back for the exams. They don’t know now when will it be conducted again. Many of us are taking online classes for the main exams. Here we have WiFi connection and can focus on our studies. Back home, connectivity is a major issue. Also, going back without knowing the new schedule of exams will only cause anxiety and uncertainty,” said Kumar, who hails from Bihar’s Sirsa. He added that some of his friends, who had gone back home early on, want to come back for lack of internet connectivity and not being able to focus on their studies.“Going back and then coming again for the exams will disrupt the entire routine. Unless there is a clear notification from the government, going back is not a solution,” said Vinay Rana, 28, another student preparing for civil services, who lives in a rented accommodation in Ber Sarai. Rana hails from Himachal Pradesh.A senior Delhi government official, who did not wish to be named, said that they are preparing the logistics for the movement of stranded students and others back to their hometowns. “We have kept students on priority and will ensure their interests are safeguarded. A set of rules is being prepared for the same,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/stuck-students-in-dilemma-go-back-home-or-stick-to-study-schedules/story-yCoTj5DuABCvNeR9k3IE8M.html

05-05-2020||Delhi||HC notice to AIIMS on shelter home inmates not receiving requisite medication||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday sought a status report from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on a plea which alleged that homeless patients suffering from critical illnesses residing in the night shelter at the hospital are not being provided the medication they were earlier receiving from the pharmacy at AIIMS. The plea sought some arrangement to be made so these patients could be provided with medication until the lockdown is lifted, and the pharmacy at AIIMS is functional again. According to the counsel for AIIMS, the functioning of the pharmacy has been affected due to a large workforce of the AIIMS not being able to reach the pharmacy during the lockdown.A bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar issued a notice to the Centre and the AIIMS on the plea by a social worker Rachna Malik who sought that medicines be given to such patients until the lockdown is lifted.The plea filed through advocate Vaibhav Pratap Singh stated that patients at the night shelter are unable to access medicines for inter alia cancer, hypertension, diabetes, neurological conditions, as a few examples. It stated that if the medication was not provided, their conditions would likely deteriorate, at which point they would need to be admitted for emergency in-patient care, which would further burden the present health care infrastructure and may even be fatal.During the hearing via video conferencing, the counsel appearing for AIIMS, told the court that the pharmacy at AIIMS has been functioning in a limited manner, and medicines for cancer and AIDS are being distributed from the pharmacy. He states that on account of a large workforce of the AIIMS not being able to reach the pharmacy due to the lockdown, the functioning of the pharmacy has been affected. He sought time to place a detailed status report on record.Following this, the court granted him time and posted the matter for a hearing on May 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-notice-to-aiims-on-shelter-home-inmates-not-receiving-requisite-medication/story-L4OHVhdKqVKU5TJyoSCrfI.html

We all celebrated with the fans,” said Vicuna who will coach ISL side Kerala Blasters this coming season.There was the return-leg derby left but the COVID-19 pandemic by then had stalled all the sporting activities, including I-League. “The Derby was still at the back of our minds, but we would never have thought that that would have been our last match,” the Spaniard said.“I would like to thank all the fans of Mohun Bagan. We got so much love throughout the season, it’s absolutely unbelievable. I feel like I am leaving a piece of my heart back in Kolkata.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/stranded-for-more-than-a-month-mohun-bagan-east-bengal-coaches-and-players-return-home/story-fwRpvLh9SrEbk8aRMqXWXL.html

The corporation has identified 113 such zones, which comprises of 97 residential buildings and 37 localities including slums where the east, west, north and south boundaries are barricaded, while the lockdown norms are still stringent in these zones.With over 400 cases, Thane city is in a red zone wherein most lockdown norms are still in place. Thane civic commissioner, Vijay Singhal, issued a circular on Monday evening on what will be allowed in containment zones and outside of the zones.An officer from TMC requesting anonymity said, “Earlier we used to declare containment areas and seal them restricting movement, however now we have demarcated proper boundaries of these areas on all four sides. They are barricaded so that residents cannot move in and out without an emergency. The police department will ensure that the barricades are in place in these areas. The zones have over 97 residential buildings in all the ten wards, whereas 37 chawls, slums and other localities are included in these.”The stringent measures are undertaken to prevent the spear of the virus in other areas of the city from the containment zones.Commissioner Singhal said, “As per my directives, the police will completely seal the boundaries of the containment zones. Only medical facilities and shops selling essential commodities will be allowed in this zone. These shops will also remain open for a time specified by the concern authorities.”The circular also states that some of the lockdown rules are eased outside of containment zones. He added, “The single shops in residential complexes can remain open. No more than five shops selling non-essential commodities will be allowed on a particular road. The residents can use four-wheelers, however not more than 2 people apart from the driver will be allowed, while double seat on a bike is banned.”The shops which are permitted by the local police will, however, have to follow all social distancing norms and also keep a hand sanitizer at the counter.Workplaces to be secureThe circular also highlighted several social distancing norms to be followed by workplaces. The workplaces will have to keep the staff number minimum to ensure that social distancing is followed at the desks. The social distancing should also be followed in office canteens during the lunch hours. Singhal said, “A shift system should be in place, to ensure minimum employees are in the office. Thermal scanning of people should be done at entry and exit points of the offices. The list of COVID hospitals and helpline numbers should be displayed, while each employee should have Arogya Setu application on his phone. Employees showing symptoms should also be tested for COVID 19.”Wedding with limited guests allowedSocial distancing should also be followed at any wedding ceremony. Not more than 50 guests will be allowed at such a wedding ceremony or any other private function. Funerals will also be permitted with merely 20 or fewer people.Pre-monsoon and construction activitySinghal has permitted the premonsoon work of different concerned authorities with prior permissions. The structural repairs, rainwater harvesting, waterproofing and metro works will also be allowed. In case of construction activity, those where the labours are not called outside of the city and can stay at the construction site will also be permitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tmc-to-barricade-97-residential-buildings-in-containment-zones/story-dCzGyVzqP5wiiBv9L32r6K.html

05-05-2020||Mumbai||No Covid-19 test for tiger cub: Nagpur college returns samples, asks the forest department to approach approved lab||The Nagpur Veterinary College (NVC) on Tuesday sent back swab samples of a three-month-old tiger cub suspected of having Covid-19, without testing them.NVC asked the forest department to approach institutes approved by the Centre for animal testing in India. “We realised that it is ethically incorrect to perform the Covid-19 test for the wild animal since we do not have the Centre’s approval. In such circumstances, the samples need to be sent to the closest approved institute, and this has been conveyed to the forest department,” said Dr AP Somkuwar, associate dean, NVC.The college is planning to get approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to be designated as an approved institute for further animal testing in Maharashtra.HT reported on Monday that swab samples of the female cub, rescued from paddy fields in Mul taluka of Chandrapur district, were collected on April 28 by the forest department after concerns of improper protective equipment during the rescue and initial ill health of the cub. Samples were sent to NVC after it was suspected that the cub might be the first case of a wild animal in Maharashtra contracting the virus. The test results were expected on Tuesday.The cub is currently being kept at a transit treatment centre in Chandrapur and is healthy, said officials.NVC’s last-minute decision left the forest department in a lurch. “If this was the case, the college could have informed us much earlier. During the lockdown, it is difficult to get permissions and interstate transportation. However, the process will begin immediately,” said AL Sonkusare, divisional forest officer (territorial), Chandrapur.SV Ramarao, chief conservator of forest, Chandrapur said, “The final decision will be taken by the chief wildlife warden as he is the nodal authority.”After the first confirmed case of a tiger testing positive for Covid-19 in New York was reported on April 5, three animal institutes were approved by the Centre for Covid-19 animal testing — National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal; National Research Centre on Equines in Hisar, Haryana, and Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh. Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra said, “Following NVC’s decision. we have decided to send the swab samples to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal. We are working on the permissions for inter state transport. Once all permissions are in place, the samples will be sent. In the meantime, the cub will remain in the transit treatment centre at Chandrapur, and efforts to runite her with her mother are put on hold till we get the results.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-covid-19-test-for-tiger-cub-nagpur-college-returns-samples-asks-the-forest-department-to-approach-approved-lab/story-NU2HneJgggtYA9bKpyzIyO.html

But no train has been arranged for them. Even if a bus is arranged, these migrants are willing to pay for the transport.

These days due to the soaring temperatures the situation is getting worse.”Dr Rajendra Bhooshan, medical specialist at the Phase-6 Civil Hospital, says “after wearing the kit, we cannot eat or drink anything. We sweat a lot and sometimes it’s difficult to breathe.”Nothing can be done about it, however, he says, adding, “Duty comes first and our passion to treat patients keeps us in high spirits.”So how do they cope? Dr Bhooshan says the mantra is “drink very little water and eat a heavy meal before the shift.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-mercury-rises-covid-warriors-in-mohali-hospitals-feel-stifled-in-ppe-kits/story-6d2p0nZIpbCQFcALeLnASP.html

05-05-2020||Chandigarh||Covid warriors battle dehydration and heat while screening residents in Chandigarh’s containment zones||Many get dehydrated, some faint as the summer heat intensifies, but there’s no stopping Chandigarh’s healthcare workers. Clad in blue protective gear from head to toe, dripping with sweat, they remain undaunted, focused only on screening patients at the city’s hotspots, Bapu Dham and Sector 30.Work hours stretch from 18 to 19 hours, and many have not taken a single day off or seen other family members.Days without a breakA valiant fighter with 40% disability, municipal corporation (MC) official Gagandeep Sharma has worked at a stretch from March 17. A team coordinator, he sends workers for contact tracing and then compiles data. “How can I ask for an off while my boss (Anil Garg, additional commissioner, MC) is also working without a break,” he says.Sharma recalls the call he received on April 24 at 10.30 pm about one person testing positive in Bapu Dham Colony. “Two teams that I alerted and sent to the colony had quarantined 40 to 50 people by 1:30am. By the next day all 190 contacts had been quarantined.”A fireman now assigned work to trace contacts of Covid-19 patients, Satyendra says he had returned home from work, washed his clothes and was about to sit for dinner when he got the alert. “By 11pm we were in Bapu Dham and had quarantined at least nine houses,” he says. He finished dinner after getting back home at 2:30am.Living in separate section of his house, Satyendra communicates with his family through video calls. His parents back in the village call him three to four times day. He misses them.Screening 25,000 people in two days“We were concerned after hearing about the infections in Bapu Dham Colony,” says Dr Vandana Bhatia, medical officer at the Sector 26 Civil Dispensary.With the support of Dr G Dewan, director, health services, she says her team managed to screen over 25,000 people there in two days. Now 58 have tested positive. Temperatures were high. “Two to three girls (health workers) fainted because of dehydration. A man urging people to get screened, fainted,” Dr Bhatia adds.The next day he was back at work.First, health workers screened over a 100 buildings with 20-25 persons each on two days .Then they were asked to screen the entire Bapu Dham Colony, covering over 25,000 people. The next day, at 7am, 75 to 80 health workers were at Dr Bhatia’s dispensary and given maps of areas they were to cover and protection kits. “We had to shout to enable people living on second and third floors to hear us asking them to get screened. Many did not cooperate till the police were called. A woman said we were creating a nuisance by shouting and disturbing their sleeping children. I was shocked,” says Dr Bhatia.While she spoke to Hindustan Times praising her team, they had started screening residents of Chandigarh’s second hotspot, Sector 30, where 20 people have tested positive.At home, she cannot meet her mother-in-law, in her 80s, because of health risks. Her husband, however, refuses to stay apart from her. “He makes me tea when I go back,” she smiles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-warriors-battle-dehydration-and-heat-while-screening-residents-in-chandigarh-s-containment-zones/story-ezQVMJLOtOu0vQ5VLM4ACN.html

According to the law-making process, once the governor accords his assent to a Bill passed by the state assembly, the Bill has to be notified as an Act (a law). “The government cannot enforce a change in the law or a new law unless a notification is issued,” said an official.Eight bills each were passed by the state assembly on March 2 and 3.Sources said that as a result of Covid-19 and the lockdown, many departments have forgotten to send the files to the law secretary for gazette notification of the assented Bills despite the fact these Bills have been assented to by the governor. Some of the departments, however, seem to be waking up now and will get the Bills notified in the coming days.Among the five Bills awaiting notification by the law and legislative department are the Haryana Official Language (amendment) Bill, 2020; the Haryana Scheduled Castes (Reservation in Admission in Government Educational Institutions) Bill, 2020; the Haryana Consolidation of Project Land (Special Provisions) Amendment Bill, 2020; the Haryana State Higher Education Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020; and the Prohibition of Child Marriage in (Haryana Amendment) Bill, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-side-effect-haryana-departments-forget-to-get-bills-passed-by-assembly-notified/story-WRJXN0wRqKGKvChkQvzxjI.html

The civic body has so far identified 69 areas as micro containment zones, or clusters, in Pune as of May 4, said officials.The PMC has imposed lockdown restrictions in these areas only while easing curbs in rest of Pune as the third phase of the lockdown came into effect Monday.According to Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, restrictions have been retained in areas where maximum Covid-19 cases are reported.“Pune’s total area is 310 sq km and only 10 sq km area has been declared as micro containment zones or micro-clusters. These areas are mainly slums and high density areas where high numbers of Covid-19 cases are reported,” said Gaikwad.The earlier order of the PMC had declared the whole of Pune as a containment zone till May 3. Now the restrictions have become area specific. “Covid-19 cases are mainly emerging from these micro clusters. Considering this, the civic body will concentrate more on the 69 areas and make efforts to control situation there. For the rest 97 per cent of the city, some relaxations have been given,’ said Gaikwad. From containment zones to micro clustersRestrictions in micro containment clusters- Police will seal the newly announced micro containment zones-No entry or exit for residents in this zone-Fixed time window for essential commodities-No pass needed for vehicles carrying milk, vegetables, medicines and groceriesIn other areas of city-No public transport- Timings for shops selling essential items is 10am to 7pm-Only 5 non-essential commodity shops will remain open.

05-05-2020||Chandigarh||Apps help maintain social distancing in Himachal||To facilitate the people of the state during lockdown and to ensure social distancing in public, the department of Information Technology (IT) has been developing applications to provide contactless service to people and to maintain social distancing within the government offices.State IT department director Rohan Chand said that the idea of these apps was to maintain social distancing and contactless services among the public and with government officials.The government is using the technology platforms provided by the IT department for gathering information, monitoring and decision-making in an efficient manner.E-PASS APPLICATIONTo provide these digitised facilities to the people, the department has developed a Covid curfew e-pass application, which is available on http://covidepass.hp.gov.in portal. Applicants desirous of entering or exit the state in their own vehicle can apply for an e-pass and those applicants who want to enter the state or exit the state and don’t have their own vehicle can register on the portal.People can apply for curfew pass on the website and the district administration will issue the pass online after verification. This application has been beneficial in reducing physical interaction and applicants can get e-pass online through a link sent through SMS.As many as 4,75,529 applications have been received and around 1,57,990 e-passes have been issued after scrutiny and verification, till date.INTERSTATE MOVEMENT In order to facilitate interstate movement of people stranded in Himachal Pradesh and vice versa, applicants can apply on http://covidepass.hp.gov.in. Covid curfew e-passes have been a boon for the large number of people stranded in different parts of the country. To strengthen this, the state nodal officer and state joint nodal officer along with other nodal officers have been appointed to collect, collate and compile data pertaining to the requests received for interstate movement and formulation of comprehensive plan, devise protocol and facilitate movement of people.For maintaining records of quarantined persons, a health worker has been assigned to each quarantined person. To track violation of quarantined locations by Covid-19 suspects and generate alerts in case of violations, the COVID quarantine app (http://covid19.hp.gov.in) has been developed.CORONA MUKT HIMACHAL APPThe ‘corona mukt Himachal’ mobile app is also part of this system. The app is to be installed on the mobile phone of quarantined person. It has the facility of locking the quarantine location, so that alerts are generated in case of violations. Besides this, the training of health officials (NHM, DSOs and BMOs) was done by the IT department at district and block levels through video conferencing. The data of around 445 quarantined persons has already been entered.PREVENTING MISINFORMATIONTo provide a common place for all government orders, advisories and media bulletins to avoid any misinformation, the department has developed ‘Covid government orders’ app, which is available on http://covidorders.hp.gov.in .The facility has been provided to secretariat and district level officers to upload Covid-19 related notifications at a single place to make them available to the citizens. More than 571 notifications are available on this portal.LAW AND ORDERAn application has also been developed for monitoring law and order related issues across the state. The application named ‘Law and order monitoring and reporting system’ provides the facility to superintendents of police and police stations for uploading law and order related information, as desired by Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of IndiaEach police station is required to report law and order related statuses on the portal four times a day and six hourly reports containing number of violations, arrests, vehicles seized, FIRs registered, fines imposed and law and order incidents reported, including preventive actions taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/apps-help-maintain-social-distancing-in-himachal/story-jlVZx2Y3Y4nsqjOMYfF50J.html
05-05-2020||Chandigarh||Police station sealed in Punjab’s Muktsar district after two cops test positive for Covid-19||A police station in Muktsar district was sealed on Tuesday after two assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs) posted at Malout sub division were found infected with Covid-19.Muktsar SSP Raj Bachan Singh Sandhu said that the entire staff of Malout City police station and the police teams posted at Rajasthan border have been quarantined. He said the family members of the ASIs and their colleagues are being examined by the health department.On Tuesday, three Punjab policemen were among 15 fresh cases of Covid-19 found in Muktsar. Sandhu said the third cop, a constable, with the 13th battalion of Punjab Armed Police (PAP) was stationed in Chandigarh but he was on duty at Bhullar village bordering Rajasthan.The SSP said it was during a random sampling on April 28 that the three police personnel were found infected by the virus. They all were asymptomatic, the SSP added.“It is a matter of concern for us and we are trying to trace the source of the infection. The Punjab Armed Police constable was on duty at Rajasthan border and to ascertain the cause of infection is a challenging task. Our teams are trying to identify contacts of the affected persons,” the SSP said.Meanwhile, the total number of coronavirus patients in Muktsar district has reached 63.Earlier, 49 people were declared positive out of which one person who was tested positive in Muktsar was shifted to Faridkot as he was a resident of that place.A spokesperson of the district administration said that of Tuesday’s 15 cases, 10 are labourers who came from Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. One is a Takht Hazur Sahib, Nanded, pilgrim and is already quarantined in Muktsar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-station-sealed-in-punjab-s-muktsar-district-after-two-cops-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-02C6XKTkZ2vWZaxrOsKtxI.html
05-05-2020||Jaipur||Worked 16 hours, non-stop for 40 days, says police official handling Jaipur’s Covid-19 hotspot||Rajendra Singh Nain is managing the biggest Covid-19 hotspot in Jaipur, the state capital of Rajasthan. The assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Ramganj circle, is in charge of the area with around 100 narrow lanes and an approximate population of around 800,000.The 54-year-old officer didn’t take a day off for around 40 days after the first case of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) was detected in Ramganj.So far, 515 Covid-19 cases have been reported only from Ramganj police station area. While Rajasthan 3099 cases of the coronavirus disease, Jaipur has 1036.A curfew was imposed in Ramganj immediately after the detection of first Covid-19 case on March 26 in an area behind a locality in Rahmani Masjid.After the curfew in Ramgaj, the first thing Nain did was form a technical team to get the call recordings of the first person detected with the deadly virus in the area.“The first positive person was not able to talk about things in detail. So, in order to know his contact history, the technical team analysed his call records and obtained details of 52 people who came in direct contact with him and later the entire chain was identified,” said Nain.In the initial days, the officer not only looked after the deployment of 600 police personnel in three shifts but also managed the needs of people like vegetables, water and other essential items.“Not only me but my entire team from Ramganj and Galta Gate police station, the two areas which falls under my limits, worked for 14 to 16 hours a day. After one shift changed, my duty was to ensure that the next lot has been properly deployed across various points,” Nain said.“The first off which I took was around 12 days ago. But at that time too I had to stay alert.”Most of the times, Nain, said he missed talking to his two sons as he used to reach home late in the night.The officer said he has a separate room in his house. As soon as he reaches home, the first thing he does is to take his shoes off and sanitise them. He then washes his clothes, takes a bath and then has his dinner.“While my family sits on the dining table and I sit on the floor and keep a distance of five to seven metres from them. I talk to my kids after that in the lawn by maintaining a physical distance of at least five metres,” the ACP said.Nain said his family— wife Aman Nain, elder son Abhinav Singh Nain and younger son Anubhav Nain—are his pillars of strength. “Their motivation means a lot to me. Whenever I am disappointed they would boost me and tell me dad ‘You are a warrior and we are proud of you’. These words keep me alive and give me the strength to work hard selflessly a do as much as possible,” he said.ACP Nain said another which keeps him and team members pumped up is that out of 515 positive cases in Ramganj and Galta Gate police station area so far, more than 300 people have turned negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/worked-16-hours-non-stop-for-40-days-says-police-official-handling-jaipur-s-covid-19-hotspot/story-O382F4Af1ZLUARPFlgzpsI.html
05-05-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab’s first ‘Shramik Express’ ferrying 1,188 migrant workers departs from Jalandhar to Jharkhand||Punjab’s first Shramik Express left the Jalandhar railway station for Daltonganj in Jharkhand with around 1,188 migrant workers on Tuesday.The labourers who were finally headed home after over a month’s wait were both excited and emotional. Those who had enrolled themselves on the state government’s portal were informed of the train’s schedule through an SMS.Jalandhar police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar said medical teams had screened of all travellers at three points - Khalsa School, Nakodar Road and Guru Nanak Dev University regional campus. Subsequently, they were brought to the railway station in 20 buses. Bhullar said social distancing norms were strictly enforced.OUT OF SAVINGS, MIGRANTS EAGER TO GO HOMEOne of the workers, Manoj Kumar, 25, who was travelling with his wife and two children, said he had come to Jalandhar from Jharkhand in February to work at a factory but had run out of money as the factory shut operations during the lockdown.“I was left with no savings and was surviving on the ration provided by the government and NGOs. I have been eagerly waiting for the day I will be able to meet my parents again,” he said.Most migrants said they had run of money and with no source of earning available to them, they wanted to return to their native villages as soon as possible.Some workers said that they will return to Punjab once the situation normalises.FACED HARASSMENTMany of them had to face harassment during the lockdown.

05-05-2020||Bangalore||Cong announcement of bearing travel cost of migrant workers ‘street play’: Sudhakar||Describing Congress’ announcement to bear the cost of travel of migrant workers as “streetplay,” Karnataka Medical Education Minister K Sudhakar on Tuesday accused the party of ‘playing politics’ even on the issue of Covid-19 and compared its mindset to Roman emperor Nero.He said the Congress instead of giving money to the concerned as per rules, was advertising about it.“Looking at Congress moving around in the streets and advertising about its willingness to pay the bus and train charges for the labourers, it is clear that it is a big street play.Instead of giving money to the concerned as per rules, they are making loud claims about it in front of cameras,” Sudhakar said in a tweet. ಕೊರೋನಾ ವಿಷಯದಲ್ಲೂ ರಾಜಕೀಯವೇ ತಮಗೆ ಮುಖ್ಯ ಮತ್ತು ಲಾಭ ಅನ್ನುವ ಇವರ ಮನಸ್ಥಿತಿಗು ಹಾಗು ರೋಮ್ ನ ಅಂದಿನ ದೊರೆ ನೀರೋ ಗು ವ್ಯತ್ಯಾಸವಿಲ್ಲ.ಯಾಕೆಂದರೆ ‘Nero was fiddling when Rome was burning’ @blsanthosh @BSYBJP @BSBommai“There is no deference between your (Congress) mind set- looking at politics and gaining mileage out of it even on the issue of corona, and that of Nero, because Nero was fiddling when Rome was burning,” he said in another tweet.The Congress on Monday had said its state units will bear the cost of rail travel of needy migrant workers stranded at their workplaces due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown and seeking to return home.Karnataka Congress Chief D K Shivakumar had announced giving Rs 1 crore cheque to Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation from the party for ensuring free transport to working class and labourers, who were suffering to reach home because of high rates being charged.However, the KSRTC, which subsequently announced free travel for those stranded within the state, has not accepted the cheque and has instead asked it to be given to Chief Minister’s relief fund.On Monday, urging the state government to immediately take necessary action to arrange for trains to bring back all stranded Kannadigas from other states, Congress had said, it was also ready to bear the monetary costs to be paid to the Railways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/cong-announcement-of-bearing-travel-cost-of-migrant-workers-street-play-sudhakar/story-n60voQ0ajBOXoL7Xen9pNM.html

05-05-2020||Delhi||Gautam Gambhir on lockdown: I don’t want a single picture of me distributing rations, I hate it||He gets disturbed while talking about the plight of migrant workers, irked on the mention of those who boast about their contribution to a cause. Balancing his duties as the Lok Sabha MP from East Delhi, and spending time at home with his family, Gautam Gambhir has his hands full and is staying calm. As the country enters third phase of the lockdown, the former cricketer talks to us about the measures being taken in his constituency “to bring the crisis under control”, relief work done by the Gautam Gambhir Foundation, and urges everyone “to be united, as this is the only way to win this battle”. Excerpts:Over 40 days into the lockdown... how are you holding up?I’ve got the opportunity to do all the things that I haven’t done throughout my life,actually. I’ve always been busy, first because of cricket, and then politics. Now, I’m spending with my little ones — making them sleep, playing with them — seeing them grow is the best feeling. I’ve been telling everyone that look at this lockdown from a positive point of view.Your daughters must be surprised to see you at home all these days. Was it tough to explain the situation outside, to your kids?The younger one (Anaiza, 3) is too small, and loves to play,so she doesn’t have that question. But, the elder one (Aazeen (6) does ask sometimes ‘why can’t we go out’, so I’ve told her there’s a lockdown. She’s only waiting for this to finish and then probably wants to go to Hamley’s for her birthday presents (she turned 6 on April 1). Also, she misses her school, friends, though she’s doing online classes, it’s not the same.Like many others celebrities and public figures, are you also being over active on social media during this time? Do you mind that or are you comfortable with the idea?It depends what do you want to gain out of this lockdown. I’ve always wanted to keep things private. Yes, I do have posted certain pictures and videos of my daughters on Instagram, which probably I haven’t done that in the past, but I don’t believe in putting everything out on social media. I don’t believe in putting my personal life, what my kids or I am doing at home on social media because some things need to be kept private as well. Lot of people do make videos and stuff but that’s their way of living life.  Two cats in one house, how long can they go without pawing each other?? 😹😸😻A post shared by  Gautam Gambhir (@gautamgambhir55) on Apr 26, 2020 at 12:05am PDTThat way you really haven’t talked much about the relief work your foundation is doing. Tell us something about that. What all has been done so far?One thing I want to share is that I’ve made very clear to my foundation team that whenever we distribute this the rations and food, I don’t ever wan’t a single picture of me because I hate it. I don’t want that. I see a lot of people who distribute kits with their own picture on it and I don’t believe in it.When you’re giving something to someone, why do you want to have your own marketing stuff on that? Okay, I won’t lie, we’ve got carry bags which has my foundation’s name on it, but not my photograph or anything, because if it gets lost, people should know that this entire thing is from the foundation. Apart from that I haven’t put a single video of me distributing. If you’re doing a good cause, do it from your heart not for people to start talking about it. If that’s your mission to do it, then your entire scenario and vision change about things. But if your intent is to help someone, then you don’t bother whether people are talking about it or not. It gives so much of self satisfaction.And there are many who claim they’re doing their bit but actually are not. To avoid such questions being posed later, are you maintaining any kind of a record for whatever relief work your foundation is doing?I’ve never lied about things. I’ve always given the right numbers and the data as well. I’ll never say that, ‘you know I’ve distributed 50,000 or 10 lakh packets till now. No, we distribute eight to 10 thousand cooked food and ration packets everyday and that’s the number. We have the data also for it — wherever it goes, we give them slips, they give us their IDs and mention which slum they belong to. We have given around 4,500 PPE kits so far, and we’ve got receipts from four different hospitals. So, everything is very black and white.  I bow down to my volunteers for risking their lives in last 30 days. Together we have distributed: Ration kits & meals to 10,000 every day 90,000 baby food kits 15,000 N95 Masks 4200 PPE Kits 2000 Bedding kits to Shelter Homes We will keep moving!🇮🇳@ggf_india @bjp4delhiA post shared by  Gautam Gambhir (@gautamgambhir55) on Apr 23, 2020 at 3:08am PDTBesides this, how are you keeping a check on the number of Covid-19 cases in your constituency?We’ve got around eight to nine hotspots in our constituency, so the entire focus is try to help people in these seald areas, as they’re the ones who’ll be deprived of lot of things. So, with the help of ACP and DCP, we try and give them as much ration as we can. But, at the same time, we’ve to be very careful that people don’t start hoarding it — that’s very dangerous. We want things to go to the needy. We don’t want people to collect stuff and say, ‘Oh, I have ration for another two or three months’. No, this is not what our aim is. We make sure we try and touch as many lives as possible. Also, from 9-10.30am every day, I interact with a lot of people in my constituency, all the volunteers who are distributing these kits. I keep telling them that it should go to the needy, it should go to the last man standing, last man who needs it.Despite so many people following the lockdown guidelines religiously, there have been cases where some group didn’t cooperate and posed a risk to everyone’s lives. Do you think some people are flouting these norms in the name of religion?This is the time where the country needs to be united, irrespective of caste, creed, religion and even social status. This will show our strength. Doesn’t matter which religion you belong to, if there are certain norms and advisories from the government, you have to follow them, otherwise a strict action needs to be taken. I’ve seen some videos where people have attacked doctors, nurses and police offers. My heart goes out to them. They haven’t gone back home for days and they also have families to take care of. They’re fighting on the frontline for us, they should be absolutely well-equipped to fight this battle, they need support more than anyone else in the country right now. We should try support them as much as we can.  Coming together of everyone in time of need is a true reflection of INDIA! We r making sure those in shelter homes have clean sheets, pillows, towels & masks I really appreciate Le Meridien & GM Ms Meena Bhatia’s generous contribution towards this cause! @bjp4delhi @ggf_indiaA post shared by  Gautam Gambhir (@gautamgambhir55) on Apr 9, 2020 at 11:13pm PDTBut what about people without masks and in poor hygiene conditions roaming on the streets? Aren’t they equally dangerous to getting or spreading the virus? What’s is being done to take care of that aspect?That’s what shelter homes were built for — to put these people there, provide them enough food to eat, maintain their hygiene, monitor them regularly and make sure they don’t go out, do not spread this virus if god forbid they have a virus. That’s what our foundation did as well. We have two shelter homes — Ghazipur and Yamuna Sports Complex. With a help of a 5-star hotel, who provided us with bed sheets, pillow covers, sanitizers, soaps, lot of things for hygiene, we’ve given it all to those shelter homes. Also, just having shelter homes will not solve the purpose, to maintain hygiene is very important. You need to see how many (people) do you need in one room because can’t just keep putting people without social distancing, it can be very dangerous.The haunting visuals of migrant workers stuck various parts of the country are still fresh in people’s minds. Do you think we could have been better prepared to handle the situation? Did they deserve all that pain?It happened in my constituency, at Anand Vihar bus stand. It was so disturbing. When our CM was doing this press conference, he said they’re feeding one crore people everyday. And then we saw the amount of people at Anand Vihar bus stand. They were two completely contrasting things. So, why don’t you just give the right data? Don’t give numbers for the heck of it. You’re only trying to fool yourself by doing that. There’s nothing wrong in accepting that we haven’t done it but will do in the future. We need to be honest to our own self and that’s the only way we can win this battle.Interact with the author at @monikarawal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gautam-gambhir-on-lockdown-i-don-t-want-a-single-picture-of-me-distributing-rations-i-hate-it/story-8R5tR38b9DE197P65wQ3gP.html

Her husband had returned from Bengaluru during the lockdown, which could be the source of infection, though it is not confirmed yet, said officials. The woman had reached Government Multi Speciality Hospital, Sector 16, with flu-like symptoms on Monday. Among those infected in Bapu Dham Colony, six are from the same family and are community contacts of two already diagnosed patients. Others include two men, aged 20 and 42, and two girls, aged 4 and 16. In the case of 42-year-old man, 10 family contacts and 15 community contacts have been traced. Contact tracing is underway in other cases.In Sector 30, a 49-year-old man and 12-year-old woman of the same household have tested positive. They are family contacts of a patient from the same sector.With the fresh cases, the chain of transmission in Bapu Dham Colony, which has been attributed to a single source, has infected 58 people, accounting for 50% of Chandigarh’s count.Meanwhile, in the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, only one patient from Chandigarh — a Sector 38 resident — is admitted in the intensive care unit, said official spokesperson Dr Ashok Kumar. Other patients are admitted in the wards and are showing good signs of recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nine-test-positive-in-chandigarh-covid-19-count-reaches-111/story-Z0XrEmpix1EMSxAMOclHWP.html

The Peerless Hospital is among the big private institutions where Covid-19 patients were being treated. A senior doctor at Peerless Hospital in south Kolkata, who did not want to be named, said more than 10 people have been affected and at least three among them are doctors.Click here for the complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“This has created a great deal of panic amongst patients, health professionals as well as the surrounding community which has been reflected by mass absenteeism, dissatisfaction and uncertainty in them. Majority staffers are admitted here and the rest are in quarantine,” Dr Sujit Kar Purakayastha, managing director of Peerless Hospital, said in a statement on Monday.“Covid-19 Task Force of the hospital, as well as the Peerless administration, have decided to close down the hospital services from May 5 with the intention of wide sanitisation and other measures till further decision,” Dr Purakayastha said.The statement, however, said that the hospital would continue to run its maternity, radiology, dialysis, cancer chemotherapy and laboratory departments.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakPeerless is the second private hospital to shut down operation after doctors and staff members contracted Covid-19. The first was Chernock Hospital in New Town in the eastern fringes of Kolkata. It stopped operations last month.“The number doctors, nurses and other hospital staff infected till April 30 is more than 100,” Dr Koushik Chaki, secretary of the West Bengal Doctors Forum that raised the issue before the government on April 28, said. Two doctors, including a senior state health department official, have also died of Covid-19 so far.Incidentally, on May 1, when eight people died, marking the highest toll in a day in West Bengal since the outbreak, the state government asked private hospitals to admit all patients without asking for certificates that said they were nor infected or, face penal action.The order has triggered fear that the coronavirus disease may spread among staff and patients in private hospitals that are unaffected till now. “There are reports that patients in need of regular critical care related to blood transfusion, dialysis, chemotherapy, obstetric care, institutional deliveries, immunization etc are facing hardship due to private hospitals/ healthcare facilities either remaining non-functional or turning away patients out of fear of contracting Covid-19. Some hospitals are insisting on Covid-free certificates before allowing the patients in,” the government’s 30-page order said. The order said healthcare services have to be normalised in a “planned manner,” giving “highest priority” to the safety of healthcare staff, following Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines.“Failure to adhere to the above shall be viewed adversely and shall make the health facilities liable for penal action under the West Bengal Clinical Establishments Act,” wrote the government. There are 67 Covid-19 hospitals and 16 test centres in West Bengal. A section of these is private institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/400-bed-kolkata-private-hospital-shuts-down-ops-after-doctors-staff-contract-covid-19/story-5XuJ9uzaFzsfSAROwYp1hJ.html
05-05-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Lonely Planet Paharganj||From early morning till late in the night, the lane would be teeming with crowds. The cafes would fill up with guests ordering lemon ginger tea and the Israeli dish of shakshuka. The restaurants would play Buddhist tantra music. The pavement mehendi wallas would be drawing elaborate hennas on arms and ankles. And inevitably, there would be touts to whisper into your ears, “Do you want ganja?”This was Paharganj, Delhi’s bustling hotel district, particularly popular among foreign backpackers.But they are no longer to be seen. And neither is the rest of the crowd.“Bilkula sannata (total silence),” says Deepak Dialani, Paharganj’s longest surviving bookseller whose little shop in Main Bazaar has been in business since 27 April, 1996.Chatting on WhatsApp from the isolation of his home in Paharganj’s Wazir Singh Gali, Mr Dialani mutters that “never ever did I see apna (my) Paharganj so eerily quiet.” In the past, the notoriously chaotic district had refused to quiet down even in the most terrible moments of Delhi’s contemporary history, the bookseller says. “Even when there was a curfew due to the killings of Sikhs, after Indira Gandhi’s assassination, you would still find kids playing cricket on the traffic-free streets.”Nobody’s playing cricket (nor badminton) on the streets now. The lanes that never slept are as dead as the graveyard.Mr Dialani, however, does go out once or twice a week to get ration from grocery shops in nearby Nehru Bazar. “You can only see a few people out for necessary shopping.”On his way to the grocers, he passes by the Main Bazaar’s hotels and cafes that were full of foreign tourists, waiters and cooks in the BC (Before Corona) era. The foreigners left the hotels soon after the lockdown began. They were evacuated in the “badi-badi gaadiyan (big vehicles)” sent by their embassies, says Mr Dialani. He isn’t sure of what has become of the people who worked in the cafes. “They have simply disappeared... all is closed.”His shop hasn’t opened for more than a month either. This too is a tragedy. Jackson’s bookstore has the city’s best collection of used books in Hebrew, French, Japanese, German and Italian. It would stay open all along the year without interruption. He would keep the shop open even during the Holi festival.The bookseller isn’t looking forward to the end of lockdown. “My main customers are foreign tourists... Paharganj’s main business comes from them... they won’t be coming back very soon... perhaps for many, many months.”Until some years ago, Paharganj had at least half a dozen used bookstores. Over the years all of them shut down one by one. Only Jackson’s survive. “I won’t let coronavirus kill my shop,” says the bookseller in calm confidence.He now poses for a photograph with his wife, Neena, and daughter, Irshita, and Kala Nag, Black Snake—a paperback thriller he is reading these days.When the pandemic recedes, Mr Dialani will again open his shop daily from 10am to 10pm, seven days a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-lonely-planet-paharganj/story-c683rlM6xWWqktpikrP9qI.html

Shops providing material to industries will open. There is no restriction on opening of shops in villages but malls will not open,” Yashpal Yadav, deputy commissioner, Faridabad said on Monday.“Faridabad district is a red zone so large market places and large market complexes are not allowed to open. Only those shops which provide essential services will open,” Yadav added.Seventy five fresh cases of coronavirus disease Covid-19 surfaced in Haryana on Monday, taking the state’s tally to 517, a health department bulletin said.So far, six people have succumbed to the infection in the state.Among the new virus cases, the maximum 29 were reported from Sonipat, followed by 23 cases from Ambala; 14 in Jhajjar; three in Panipat; two each in Jind and Faridabad; and one each in Gurgaon and Nuh.Faridabad is the worst-affected district with 75 Covid-19 cases, followed by Gurugram and Sonipat with 73 cases, Nuh with 59, Jhajjar with 56, Ambala with 37 and Palwal with 36 cases. According to the bulletin, the number of active cases has gone up to 257 from 81 in a few days.Haryana’s recovery rate, which had been one of the best in the country, dropped from 72 per cent last week to 49.13 per cent.He said during third phase of the coronavirus lockdown, which began on Monday, several relaxations have been given but it was observed that many people did not follow the guidelines.“It seems people have not yet made social distancing a habit,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-19-lockdown-standalone-shops-allowed-to-open-in-faridabad-concern-in-haryana-after-spike-in-cases/story-UGqoAChxZADLQu1zrXFOyO.html
05-05-2020||Delhi||Movement curbs still in place at Delhi’s borders with Noida, Gurugram||While certain rules, part of the restrictions imposed across the country in the wake of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, were relaxed on Monday, Delhi’s interstate borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh remained almost sealed.In Gurugram, over 1,000 travellers, expecting a relaxation in curbs in view of Lockdown 3.0, returned disappointed as police personnel restricted their entry to Delhi. Borders between the two cities were sealed last week and the entry of only those engaged in essential services, carrying valid passes, is allowed. Meanwhile, law enforcement officials kept a strict vigil at the Gautam Budh Nagar-Delhi border on Monday—only those carrying valid passes were allowed to enter and exit the district via the interstate border after thorough verification.The Gurugram police said that as many as 1,045 people were turned away from borders between 7am and 6pm on Monday. They had said on Sunday that intra-district movement was allowed, but there would no movement between the national Capital and Gurugram, due to the rising number of cases in Delhi.Karan Goel, the assistant commissioner of police (DLF), said that people had assumed that they would be allowed to cross the border as they had received emails from their employers to resume work, but they did not have passes. “People requested to be allowed as they had not received salaries for the last two months and if they did not report, would not be paid,” he said.With 85 Covid-19 cases, Gurugram is on the Union government’s orange zone list. Its 11 borders with Delhi, which is a red zone, were sealed last week.While the Union home ministry issued federal guidelines on Friday, states and local authorities can frame rules specific to them based on ground reality. Based on that, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate (DM) Suhas LY tweeted the dos and don’ts of interstate travel on Sunday. “Restriction on interstate movement/interdistrict movement stands as before. No interstate/inter-district movement of personnel allowed for permitted activities also (except for previously allowed purpose like Covid-19 duty, emergency services, etc.) [sic],” he tweeted.However, health workers on Covid-19 duty, media personnel with authorisation letters and policemen, among a few others, are exempt. “Most people who are aware of the regulations are not coming to the border. But there are a few exceptions. All restrictions on the movement at the interstate border with Delhi are in place as they were earlier,” Rajesh S, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Gautam Budh Nagar district, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/movement-curbs-still-in-place-at-delhi-s-borders-with-noida-gurugram/story-0WYDeyyzikXOOA5MvbO3BP.html

05-05-2020||Patna||Bihar deputy CM Sushil Modi’s ‘failed to donate’ charge draws RJD-Cong’s ire||Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi on Monday drew flak from the opposition for charging the RJD-Congress combine with failure to contribute “a single paisa” into the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund from which money is drawn to provide assistance to those badly affected by the lockdown.The senior BJP leader had made the allegation in a tweet on Sunday wherein he had also launched a veiled attack on a sitting Congress MLA, who had shot off a letter to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, seeking return of Rs 50 lakh released from his local area development fund.“During the crisis that has arisen out of corona outbreak and lockdown, legislators of JD(U) and BJP contributed their one-month salary. Those in the RJD-Congress, failed to contribute a single paisa and displayed their insensitivity by demanding return of Rs 50 lakh,” Sushil Modi known for routinely taking potshots at political adversaries via the micro-blogging site had remarked.His allusion was to Md Tauseef Alam, the multiple-term MLA from Bahadurganj in Kishanganj district, who had written the angry letter last week and displayed its copies to the media alleging that his constituency had been in a state of “total neglect” by the health machinery, with even bare essentials like hand sanitisers in short supply.Modi’s tweet drew an indignant response from Congress MLC and AICC panelist Prem Chandra Mishra, who warned the deputy CM that he take back his words, failing which he will be slapped with a legal notice.“I had myself donated my salary in March. So have many of my party colleagues. The Deputy CM has made remark that is false and seeks to demean us in the eyes of the public. He should withdraw his remarks else we will send him a legal notice,” Mishra told reporters.Danish Rizwan, spokesman of the Hindustani Awam Morcha founded and headed by former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, said in a statement that his party boss who is a sitting MLA had donated his one-month salary and posted on social media a screenshot of the transaction receipt.“Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi must apologise for coming out with a false remark that seeks to defame opposition leaders,” Rizwan said.RJD MLA and spokesman Bhai Virendra pointed out that the partys de facto leader Tejashwi Yadav had announced that 50 per cent of his salary for his remaining term, which comes to an end with the expiry of the assembly later this year, shall go to the ‘corona eradication fund’ set up by the health department.“Moreover, 15 per cent pay cut has been announced by the government for all members of the legislature, which has only been welcomed by the opposition and ought to be seen as a contribution. It does not behoove a person holding a high office to make petty comments,” he added.Notably, contributions were made to the ‘corona eradication fund’ from the Mukhyamantri Kshetra Vikas Yojana, Bihar’s revamped version of the local area development fund for members of the bicameral legislature, following a cabinet nod for release of Rs 50 lakh from the quota of each legislator.Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had said that legislators were “free to contribute more” out of the fund, which empowers every member of either house to recommend works worth Rs 3 crore every year.While the corona eradication fund is meant for fighting the pandemic and preventing its spread, allocations from the Chief Ministers Relief Fund go towards schemes like monetary assistance to stranded migrant laborers, running of relief centres where they are provided with food, shelter and medical aid.Meanwhile, the BJP sought to back the deputy CM to the hilt.The party’s state unit spokesman Nikhil Anand came out with a strongly-worded statement claiming that “Congress-RJD leaders consider the public money at their disposal, raised through the efforts of the common people, as their private property. They should be ashamed of what Tausif has done”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bihar-deputy-cm-sushil-modi-s-failed-to-donate-charge-draws-rjd-cong-s-ire/story-T8w4ZBiXQUoI6CtQS7BQ3M.html

05-05-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s vehicular pollution dropped by three-fourth during lockdown period: Study||Transport pollution levels declined by three-fourth across Mumbai and Pune between March 24 and April 25 (lockdown period), as compared to the period between February 20 and March 20, revealed an analysis published by the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) on Sunday.Meanwhile, the pollutant-measuring indicator, air quality index (AQI), in Mumbai was 37 (good), making it the cleanest air day so far this year, while Pune recorded 47, also under the ‘good’ category.The month-wise comparison of air quality levels for four cities – Mumbai, Delhi, Pune and Ahmedabad – also revealed that the highest reduction was witnessed in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels for Pune at 70%, followed by Mumbai (69%). Delhi and Ahmedabad recorded a 33% and 30% decline in NO2 levels. Average NO2 concentration fell from 23 parts per billion (ppb) before lockdown month to 7 ppb during lockdown for Mumbai, and 24 ppb to 7 ppb for Pune.“Drastic NO2 decline in Mumbai and Pune indicate that vehicular emissions play a major role in contributing to overall air pollution. Stringent restrictions imposed during the lockdown helped in bringing down the pollution level. Even industrial emissions were lower. However, in Delhi and Ahmedabad this was not the case because under minor influence of external emissions, mild dust storms allowed pollutant particles to be suspended closer to the surface,” said Gufran Beig, director, SAFAR. Toxic gases such as NO2 are formed by burning of coal, oil, and emissions from vehicles that worsen respiratory conditions. “NO2 or other oxides of nitrogen can lead to chemical deposition in the lungs, leading to inflammation of the lung tissue. Prolonged exposure weakens the lungs leading to serious ailments,” said Dr Sanjeev Mehta, pulmonologist (chest specialist), Lilavati Hospital, Bandra.SAFAR also recorded reduction in PM2.5 levels, which showed maximum decline at Ahmedabad at 51%, followed by Mumbai 49%, Pune 39% and Delhi 31%. PM2.5 is breathable particulate matter comprising solid and liquid particles of 2.5 microns in size or smaller.“Unlike NO2, PM2.5 is influenced by other factors including meteorological conditions. All four cities witnessed weather disturbances leading to fluctuating particulate matter concentration during lockdown,” said Beig.Independent researchers said a comparative analysis for air quality is more valid when done for the same period year-on-year.“When we compared month-wise averages, meteorological conditions between two months may be very different from each other which may not establish the reduced impact of external emissions within a city,” said Ronak Sutaria, founder and director, UrbanSciences.Meanwhile, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) also recently published its analysis of Mumbai’s air quality between March 16 and April 15. The analysis revealed that Mumbai had witnessed a 40% reduction in PM2.5, 43% decline in PM10 (larger coarser particles), 77% reduction in NO2, 59% fall in average benzene levels (contributes to volatile organic compounds) and 50% drop in sulphur dioxide (SO2 – colourless gas with pungent odour that causes respiratory diseases). “The absence of non-essential vehicles, combustion activities in industries and commercial construction sites during the period may be attributable to the decline,” the analysis stated.The lowest 24 hourly average for PM10 was 54 microgrammes per cubic metre against the safe limit of 100 µg/m3, PM2.5 was 20 µg/m3 against safe limit of 60 µg/m3, and NO2 levels at 5 µg/m3 against 80 µg/m3 safe limit. “Hourly decline in all pollutants was observed due to restriction on construction activities, less road dust resuspension, and to some extent curb on industrial activities. Absence of emission sources was seen missing at night early morning that would otherwise accumulate before lockdown,” said a senior CPCB official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-vehicular-pollution-drops-by-three-fourth-during-lockdown-period-safar-analysis/story-lB0HxcSWx0PsAZM1cfk4XK.html

Nearly 15 lakh students from Maharashtra have written SSC exams this year.“Some papers which are evaluated are still stuck in teachers’ homes and are not being sent for moderation. If the state board uses transport that is permitted for essential services, such papers can reach moderators which will help speed up the process of evaluation,” said Tawde while speaking to the media.On March 24, the education department had permitted teachers to assess answer sheets at home, but many answer sheets remain in schools. “We are feeling bad that we cannot do much because of the lockdown. But if we get papers [at home], we will complete moderating them on time,” said a teacher from a school in suburban Mumbai.Officials at the Maharashtra State Board did not respond to calls and messages. The board usually declares Class 12 results in end-May and Class 10 results by mid-June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/transport-answer-sheets-in-essential-service-vehicles-says-former-maharashtra-education-minister/story-LyFOs6jAlLZta7yhm2E7BJ.html
05-05-2020||Mumbai||Back from Rajasthan, students from Maharashtra recount lockdown experiences||After being stuck in hostels and paying-guest accommodations in Kota, Rajasthan, for approximately six weeks of the lockdown, the 1,800 students from Maharashtra are relieved to be home after the state organised buses to bring them back last week.On Friday, more than 18 buses, arranged by the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), brought the stranded students back to their homes. The journey was not smooth for everyone. “After being dropped off at Mumbai Central at around 11pm, we were told to ask our parents to pick us up. No one had informed us of this earlier and some of us faced a lot of trouble to reach home,” said 18-year-old Suman Kalra (18).Kalra was among 1,800 students attending various integrated coaching institutes in Kota. She was preparing for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for undergraduate medical and dental studies. “ We were barely nine out of the 60 in my hostel when the state-arranged transport vehicles reached us. Most students from other states had already returned home. The only respite was that we didn’t have to struggle for food. Our hostel was providing meals every day,” said Aditi Thorat, 18, another NEET aspirant and a resident of Karmala district in Solapur. Some states had arranged to transport students from Kota in the first two weeks of April.For students living as paying guests, living conditions got worse during lockdown. “We usually depend on tiffin services, which were discontinued due to the lockdown. Eventually, we depended on eggs and instant noodles for weeks together. On some days, we couldn’t buy groceries because many of us depend on local buses,” said Kabir Sharma, 19, from Navi Mumbai and a Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) aspirant who had been in Kota for the last two years.Kota is an education hub with coaching institutes catering to engineering and medical aspirants from all over the country. In peak season, close to 1.5 lakh students join coaching institutes in Kota every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/back-from-rajasthan-students-from-maharashtra-recount-lockdown-experiences/story-zUy1yUTN2tNHqL3m1Zme4L.html
05-05-2020||Mumbai||Drop in deaths before admission to hospital, reveals Mumbai civic body data||The number of people brought dead to hospitals in Mumbai has decreased by 28% in the sample week of April 14 to April 21, 2020, in comparison to the corresponding period last year, and by 40% in the same period of 2018, data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has revealed. Between April 14 and 21 this year, 73 patients were declared dead before admission, while in 2019, the number was 102 for the same week in 2019. In 2018, 123 patients had were brought dead to the hospital. The number of people dying within 24 hours of admission to hospitals has also seen a decline. Between April 14 and 21 this year, 90 patients died within 24 hours of being admitted to the hospital. This is a marginal drop from the 92 patients and 99 patients who died between the same period in 2019 and 2018 respectively.BMC said it has been tracing senior citizens with co-morbidities who do not show any symptoms of Covid-19 and admitted them to non-coronavirus hospitals for observation, care and treatment. It has attributed the decline in the number of deaths this year to this policy. “For deaths that occur due to health complications and trauma deaths, patients are brought dead to hospitals or die in the hospital after one or two days. The number of brought dead cases have gone down because of a possible drop in trauma deaths and accidental deaths, as well as due to the timely medical care given to the elderly and to those with comorbidities due to BMC’s efforts. Also, there is an increase in awareness among people reporting illnesses and citizens are less stressed out as they are working from home. As there is no traffic due to the lockdown, the time taken to reach the hospital for a health emergency has come down, leading to the decline in the number of deaths,” a senior civic official said. As of May 3, BMC has surveyed 42,752 senior citizens in its door-to-door drives. It has identified 691 senior citizens with low oxygen levels in their blood to start oxygen therapy in civic-run hospitals which are not treating Covid-19 patients.Meanwhile, the city also witnessed a 36% decrease in the number of deaths in March and April owing to co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and pneumonia, as compared to the same period in the past three years. This year, 595 people died due to comorbidities in March and April, against 937 people who died in 2019, 883 in 2018 and 729 in 2017. This is despite the fact that 75% of the total 343 Covid-19 deaths in Mumbai until May 3 were of patients with comorbidities.Around 50-60% Covid-19 deaths occur within three days from the date of admission to the hospital.

In a letter to UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, CITCO progressive union chairman Kashmir Chand said, “Being a commercial organisation, CITCO cannot bear the burden of salaries of employees, unless funded by the Chandigarh administration during the lockdown.”“Therefore, being an important arm of UT administration, we have demanded sanction/grant to pay salaries for six months, amounting to ₹33 crore to CITCO employees, so that we can get through these tough times and survive in the future” he added.Currently, CITCO has around 690 regular/ contractual staff and 653 outsourced staff (through service providers) whose monthly salaries amount to ₹5.5 crore.President of the union, Prem Lal said, “ The Chandigarh administration has directed that the entire staff, including outsourced/contractual, must be paid full wages without any deduction for the lockdown period. This has created another financial hurdle for CITCO. “||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/citco-union-demands-33-crore-to-tide-over-covid-19-lockdown-in-chandigarh/story-9PTqpZpN97vx2GKmtNPN6H.html
05-05-2020||Mumbai||26/11 hero found lying on the footpath; Samaritans and cops reunite him with family||On April 29, Harishchandra Shrivardhankar, who is in his late 60s, was found lying helpless on the footpath near a shop at Saat Rasta by Dean D’Souza, the store’s owner. Wondering how the man would be able to fend for himself during the coronavirus-enforced lockdown, D’Souza and his friends took it upon themselves to get Shrivardhankar home. What followed was another heart-warming tale of the spirit of Mumbai with a group of residents, along with the police, reuniting the senior citizen with his family in Kalyan on May 1.However, what makes this tale different, and sad, is that Shrivardhankar is a hero of the 26/11 terror attacks.Shrivardhankar, a then government employee, had braved two bullets on his back and according to an HT report in 2010, was one of the main witnesses who deposed before the special court and identified Ajmal Kasab as one of the gunmen who went on a rampage on 26/11. Shrivardhankar was injured in the firing by Kasab and his accomplice, Abu Ismail, outside Cama and Albless Hospital. He had even got into a scuffle with Ismail and had hit him with his office bag.D’Souza says, “I found him lying in a bad condition near my shop. When I approached him, he couldn’t talk and was just mumbling a few words. Even if we gave him food, he would not eat it.” With just the words “Harishchandra”, “BMC” and “Mahalakshmi” that he mumbled, D’Souza began the mammoth task of finding the family. “After a lot of effort, D’Souza found his [Shrivardhankar’s] brother, who lives in Mahalaxmi. He gave us further details about his son, who stays in Kalyan,” says Timothy Gaikwad, a school friend of D’Souza and who runs an organisation, IMCares, which helps the destitute. D’Souza’s friends found out via news reports that their man was a 26/11 survivor. “A man who was lauded by everyone then was now lying helpless,” says Gaikwad.Gaikwad got in touch with the Mumbai Police, who then contacted Shrivardhankar’s family in Kalyan. The family had lodged a missing complaint at the local station and said that Shrivardhankar had been missing for two months. Mahesh Shinde, public relations officer at the Gamdevi police station, says, “We have immense workload these days, but it was our duty to help this man. It took a lot of co-ordination with different teams.” D’Souza, after he found Shrivardhankar, gave him a hot-water bath, got a barber to cut his hair and got a set of clothes from Shrivardhankar’s brother before he was sent to his family. “The scene was one to be seen. Four or five cars came in and the senior policemen said that let Shrivardhankar decide which car he wants to travel in. They also gave a special pass to his son to travel to Mumbai to take him back,” Gaikwad says. According to the 2010 HT report, Shrivardhankar had developed a speech problem after his near-death encounter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/26-11-hero-found-lying-on-the-footpath-samaritans-and-cops-reunite-him-with-family/story-fwhx1MKI1JMgM82A4lgGIM.html
05-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chaos in Kharar, Zirakpur as shops open up for business||Markets in Kharar and Zirakpur witnessed chaos as shopkeepers opened businesses after 40 days, on Monday.Most residents moving out of their homes gave a miss to basic safety norms including wearing mask and maintaining social distancing.In Kharar, despite orders being issued allowing only shopkeepers to use their vehicles, other residents took out their vehicles in violation of restrictions, and police failed to act. Three entry points to the market had been sealed but people drove in after arguing with policemen on duty. Shops have been allowed to open group-wise in Kharar to ensure there is no crowding in markets. “We had stopped many vehicles from entering. Then, we started getting calls about stopping certain people. So, we had to let them go,” a police officer said, pleading anonymity.Police and the administration were on their toes after 11 am to ensure no shops were kept open beyond the permissible time. However, in many places, some shopkeepers tried to open up as the police team left after checking, but by 2pm all markets were closed.“We faced issues as most people in vehicles claimed they have a shop or are suppliers. So, we had to allow them all. We are working out to streamline vehicular movement so that it can be minimised,” Kharar sub-divisional magistrate Himanshu Jain said.Confusion prevails in Zirakpur, odd-even fails to work In Zirakpur and Dera Bassi, confusion on whether shops would be open till 11am or 1pm prevailed. Most residents stepping out of their homes failed to wear masks. All shops opened up without following the odd-even formula. Police focused on ensuring the closure of shop after permissible time instead of implementing the formula as they received no orders. Police teams and civil administration kept making rounds asking people to close down shops. “The odd -even formula is difficult to implement in Dera Bassi sub-division so everyone took advantage of that and almost all shops were opened,” a garment seller in Zirakpur said. “We are streamlining the odd-even formula based off the number on which shopkeepers pay property tax. So, in a day or two, we will be able to ensure strict compliance,” said Kuldeep Bawa, SDM, Dera Bassi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chaos-in-kharar-zirakpur-as-shops-open-up-for-business/story-5zUHczenLCUZFTBTVYSZBP.html

Apart from Thackeray, the Shiv Sena has also decided to re-nominate Neelam Gorhe for the second seat on which the party is contesting the polls. She will be looking to win the council elections for the fourth term. “He [the CM] is primarily occupied in dealing with coronavirus-related work. So depending on his availability, he will file his nomination. But tentatively, he is expected to file the papers on Wednesday,” a senior Shiv Sena functionary, who did not wished to be named, said. The last date to file nomination is May 11 and the election on the nine seats of the legislative council is scheduled for May 21. Thackeray is not a member of any of the state legislature currently, and it is a constitutional requirement for the CM of the state to get elected to one of the two Houses. Thackeray, who would be contesting in his debut election, is the second member of his family to fight any poll. His son Aaditya, who is the environment and tourism minister of Maharashtra, had won the Assembly elections held in October from the Worli constituency. Meanwhile, Sena’s second candidate Gorhe, has been a Member of Legislative Council (MLC) since 2002 and is also the deputy chairperson of the upper house.

We intercepted them a few kilometers away from Trikuta Nagar and sent them to their rented accommodations, he added.The police officer said that the migrants were facing hardships and had no money or food which forced them to walk miles to reach their hometown.Later, additional district magistrate Tahir Firdous Dutt reached the spot and interacted with the labourers. He also requisitioned two SRTC buses in which they were sent back to their place of stay.He said there are around 75,000 migrant labourers in Jammu and the government is making every effort to ensure free delivery of ration to them.Terming the lockdown as the ‘toughest phase of their impoverished lives’, migrant workers in Jammu and Kashmir on May 1 had urged the government to run special trains to send them back to their home districts.Migrant workers from Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha, who are largely into construction and allied sectors migrated to the Union territory for a living.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/64-migrants-in-jammu-heading-to-up-on-foot-sent-back/story-thqNukv3qZL0pUp7b3Vg4L.html
05-05-2020||Chandigarh||Confusion, crisis: 90% industrial units stay shut in Chandigarh||Even as Chandigarh administration lifted the 41-day curfew, allowing industrial activity to resume, nearly 90% of the units in the city’s twin industrial areas remained closed on Monday.Confusion over whether odd-even formula was applicable to the industry, low demand prospects for the local manufacturing units, inadequate labour and even poor financial status of companies resulted in very few units opening up.“Even though the UT order on lockdown on Sunday didn’t mention the odd-even formula, on Monday police personnel were asking industrial units with odd address number to close down. This created a lot of confusion and many owners decided to keep their factories shut,” said Pankaj Khanna, president, Industries Association of Chandigarh.Also, movement back to Panchkula and Mohali was a big issue for industrialists coming from these cities to Chandigarh. “A common plan of movement is a must for the tricity, so that it does not discourage people from entering Chandigarh,” said Naveen Manglani, president, Chamber of Chandigarh Industries. The units that opened on Monday were primarily that of spare part units which are ancillary units to bigger factories outside the city. “With factories opening in other parts of the country, their ancillary units had a reason to open up. But, most other units, like more than 100 furniture manufacturing units here, don’t foresee any demand in near future. And with labour shortage also being an issue, they decided not to open up,” said Ashok Goel, chief executive officer, Vanser, the Furniture Merchants.SCREW MAKERS’ GROUSE Meanwhile, Chandigarh Screw Manufacturers’ Association decided that all screw manufacturing units will be closed till May 17 in view of the risk of spread of coronavirus. “The ration expenditure will be provided to the workers present in the city by the respective entrepreneurs. The delay in decision making regarding fixed electricity charges by the Chandigarh administration for Covid period is also criticised by the members unequivocally,” said BS Saini, general secretary of the association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/confusion-crisis-90-industrial-units-stay-shut-in-chandigarh/story-b7IG2GaAmXyGekonK9EiqO.html

In all 50,000 medical and health teams have been set up for screening and health checkup of migrants. Five special trains carrying migrant labourers from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Karnataka were set to reach Uttar Pradesh.The chief minister said officers being sent to districts would work under the supervision of divisional commissioners. He said only such officers should be sent to districts who have not been deployed in fight against Covid-19.He said the officers should regularly visit quarantine centres, shelter homes and community kitchens that should be geo-tagged for regular monitoring by the control rooms. He said district magistrates should appoint nodal officers for quarantine centres and community kitchens etc and better performance was needed at every level to defeat coronavirus.Yogi said migrant labourers found medically fit should be sent to 14-day home quarantine. He said a sustenance allowance of Rs 1,000 should be given to the labourers leaving for their homes and added that arrangements should be made for medical treatment of those not found in good health.Yogi said the chief minister’s helpline should be used to connect with village pradhans and corporators and the monitoring committees must ensure that information about arrival of any outsider was given to the administration.Yogi said work in industrial units should be started by following security norms and in accordance with advisory of the union government. He said those working in hotspots should not be attending their offices. He said people should mandatorily use face mask or face cover while moving out.The chief minister said social distancing must be followed while carrying out immunisation work. He said para medical staff carrying out immunisation work should use face masks, gloves and sanitisers.He said all ventilators should be made functional and added that a work-plan should be prepared to mobilise additional resources. He said people should be made aware about the national portability scheme for ration cards to ensure that they get the benefits of the scheme.Yogi said migrant labourers from Maharashtra and Karnataka, residing in UP, have used the ration cards of their respective states to take food grains in UP. He said migrant labourers returning to UP should be linked with ‘one district one product’ scheme, Vishwakarma Shram Samman Yojana and milk societies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/yogi-keep-spl-vigil-in-lucknow-agra-send-officers-to-help-in-dists/story-GxRr89ILgOOQ0Yw8TbNNcM.html
05-05-2020||Mumbai||With Covid-19 cases on the rise in Mumbai’s Dharavi, migrants from Tamil Nadu try to return||In the first week of April, a septuagenarian suffering from oral cancer in Dharavi – Asia’s biggest slum — returned back to his village in Salem, Tamil Nadu, in an ambulance, which his son had managed to arrange after much struggle. The patient had come to Mumbai in February for his treatment at the Tata Memorial Hospital.Huddled in the ambulance with him were his neighbours — a 17-year-old boy with Down syndrome and his mother. The boy’s mother had earlier tried to get a permit to take him back home in an ambulance, but was not given permission citing it to be a a ‘non-emergency’ request. “My son would rush out of our room [in Dharavi] due to the suffocating conditions. It is too risky as he could be exposed to the virus. My 15-year-old daughter wasn’t even allowed to go near him,” said the boy’s mother.The cancer patient said the boy would get agitated and cry throughout the night as his family did not let him step out. “As it was impossible for the family to keep him cocooned in their small room round the clock, his mother requested us to allow them in the ambulance as our family member,” said the patient.The mother and son live in the neighbouring district of Villupuram, about two-and-half hours from Salem. They had a non-Covid certificate that allowed them to cross the state borders.“My son is better now as there is enough space for him to roam around,” said the boy’s mother.Spread across approximately 210 to 240 hectares, Dharavi is home to a population of around 8.5 lakh people. As per the civic body data, almost 15% of the population comprises of migrants from Tamil Nadu who have settled in the slums of the Dharavi decades ago. However, hundreds of migrants from Tamil Nadu are now desperate to their native state through the porous inter-state borders, as they fear contracting the Covid-19 infection in Dharavi’s overcrowded slums, extending to 70-120 square feet rooms.“We have stopped going out but it’s a challenge to keep my children confined in the room. We cover our hands and feet with plastic before using community toilets. We are living in fear,” said Sundari Chari, 32, who resides with her husband, two children and in-laws in an 110 square feet room.According to the information shared by the Tamil Nadu government, migrants in Dharavi are trying to get inside the state through commercial essential vehicles such as vegetables supplying vans, in the absence of public transport.Authorities in Tamil Nadu are monitoring these movements. High security has been imposed on national highways to monitor the entry of potentially-infected migrants from Dharavi and other parts. The Tamil Nadu government has set up testing facilities and quarantine centres near national highways, and police personnel have been posted in civilian clothes along the highway. Recently, two people from Dharavi who drove over 1,800 kms on two-wheelers to Tirunelveli district, southern Tamil Nadu through Karnataka were caught by Tamil Nadu police officers, Shilpa Prabhakar Satish, district collector, Tirunelveli, told HT.Spending nights on roads and sleeping at empty bus stands and temple premises, the duo took four days to reach their native town. They were so dehydrated, weak and frail that they were not in a position to share their information when apprehended by the police. They were provided with water by the police, and later tested for Covid-19. The two were then sent to a nearby quarantine centre and allowed to go home only after their report came negative. “Slum dwellers from Dharavi are taking drops in vans supplying essential commodities from national highways. Some are coming on two wheelers, and some others even in ambulances with patients,” said Satish. According to Satish, many who have lost their livelihoods want to return because they don’t have to worry about food in their native homes.Kalla Prasad, 41, a native of Avudaiyapuram, said, “We can survive through farming. My brothers are worried and keep calling me back.”The Tamil Nadu government has now initiated talks with the Maharashtra government to find out a possible mode of transport to bring its stranded people back.“It is not only Dharavi, but hundreds are stuck in different districts of Maharashtra after the lockdown. So, our government is communicating with the Maharashtra government to find out ways to bring them to Tamil Nadu. All panchayat heads have been informed to keep an eye on the people entering their villages,” said Satish.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/with-covid-19-cases-on-the-rise-migrants-from-tamil-nadu-in-mumbai-try-to-return/story-htPd1d0OIsRoJEftIJL7zM.html
05-05-2020||Chandigarh||Chaos at borders as Chandigarh comes back to life after 41 days||As chaos ruled at Chandigarh’s borders and some people entered the city without screening after the 41-day curfew to prevent Covid-19 transmission was lifted on Monday, the UT administration requested the Punjab and Haryana governments to change their office timings.The administration also decided to change its own office timings with UT administrator VPS Badnore announcing a new 10.30am to 4.30pm schedule from Tuesday after his daily meeting to review the situation.This, Badnore hoped, would reduce the rush of employees travelling to different offices of Punjab, Haryana and the central government at the same time.UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida has also written to the chief secretaries of Punjab and Haryana on Monday asking for a timing change to help prevent clash of timings with “each other and Central government offices and help in avoiding congestion on roads”.About 3,298 vehicles with 3,759 persons were screened at the border by Chandigarh Police and 513 vehicles (ferrying 947 persons) were not allowed to enter due to lack of ID cards and curfew passes.Long vehicle queues formed at Chandigarh’s main entry points in the morning as police screening slowed things, but many entered the city unchecked because of the heavy traffic buildup. Restrictions on number of passengers in two- and four-wheelers were also violated with impunity and 107 two-wheelers and 12 four-wheelers were challaned for carrying more people than specified to maintain social distancing.Because of the rush police personnel could not screen everyone with thermal scanners. “Today, the flow of vehicles increased tremendously and people were getting impatient when asked to wait. It put us under pressure at the checkpoints. So, some vehicles drove by without screening,” said a policeman on duty near the Zirakpur-Chandigarh barrier, requesting anonymity.Similar problems were reported at the Panchkula-Chandigarh housing board light point.Even as rules allowed one person to drive a two-wheeler, 107 were penalised for talking along pillion riders. The 12 four-wheelers challaned carried more than the three people allowed.UT’s request to the Mohali administration to issue movement passes for Mohali residents coming to Chandigarh for work has also been approved. People running businesses, shops etc coming from Mohali to Chandigarh will now be issued passes for 10 am to 6 pm by the Mohali administration. Government officials will be allowed to travel between the two cities on the basis of their official ID cards.The UT will also take up the issue with the Panchkula administration on Tuesday.In Panchkula, the police managed to keep a strict vigil at checkpoints, only letting in people with passes issued by the district administration after announcements were made on Friday of very stringent screening processes and sealing of entry points.“We have strict orders not to allow anyone from Chandigarh into Panchkula without a pass. Everyone will go through medical screening. Those without a pass will be sent back,” said a police official on duty at the housing board point. Meanwhile, Panchkula residents coming to the UT had to stay back because of non-issuance of passes by the Panchkula administration.UT officials on Monday also discussed opening up all shops, but decided to stick with the odd-even formula for the time being. “These are dynamic situations which we will constantly review any improvements. For now we will persist with the odd-even formula for opening of shops,” Parida said.

05-05-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra to use TB machine for early diagnosis of coronavirus||Maharashtra has decided to use tuberculosis (TB) machine for early diagnosis of individuals with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2), which causes Covid-19. Currently, the state conducts a molecular test — cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification tests (CBNAAT) – using the GeneXpert technology to diagnose TB. The CBNAAT detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria which causes TB. However, the customised test for Covid-19 will detect the E gene (found in RNA of coronaviruses) and N2 gene (specific to SARS-CoV2) in the samples. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has approved the use of the US-grown technology to detect Covid-19.The machine can test four samples at a time and declare results in 45 minutes. “To run the diagnosis, we need a different type of cartridge. At present, testing for TB involves extraction of DNA from the sample. The new cartridge will extract the RNA from Covid-19 samples,” said Dr Sanjay Mukherjee, secretary of Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD).The state government has got 10,000 Covid cartridges from the Centre. The testing will start by the end of this week. All district hospitals which have CBNAAT can apply to ICMR for permission for testing. Sion hospital is planning to apply for the same.As per the ICMR, the CBNAAT should be carried under Biosafety 2 level (BSL-2) conditions and with appropriate biosafety precautions. Also, any laboratory that has been approved to test Sars-CoV-2 will not require further ICMR nod to use TB machines.In Maharashtra, three laboratories have been selected— Intermediate Reference Laboratory based in Nagpur and Pune, and at RCSM government medical college, Kolhapur. The minimum requirement to carry out testing is presence of at least one microbiologist experienced in molecular virology along with technicians. Rajasthan, Karnataka, Kerala and Jammu also plan to conduct tests using this method.In the absence of a vaccine or drugs to treat Covid-19, faster diagnosis and early medical intervention is essential. “Under the present testing procedure, diagnosis takes almost eight hours. This test can provide faster results, saving more time and lives,” said Dr Ramraje Nagsen, pulmonologist from JJ hospital. “We need to give it a try, even though it is not scientifically proven.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-to-use-tb-machine-for-early-diagnosis-of-coronavirus/story-qB87p3VsKbtHLYkx2x33wL.html

05-05-2020||Chandigarh||Zirakpur MC chief under scanner for issuing completion certificates sans authority||The Mohali district administration will be probing alleged misuse of power by the Zirakpur executive officer in issuing completion certificates to eight major residential-cum-commercial projects in February this year. The certificates were issued to these projects spread over more than five acres, even as the official, Manvir Singh Gill, did not have the authority under the relevant rules.According to the Punjab government’s 2010 notification, for issuing completion certificates of sixth category building plans (multiplex, group housing, nursing home, hospital, educational institute), the file has to be sent to the director, local bodies, who further forwards it to the secretary, local bodies, after a thorough scrutiny by the chief town planning wing of the department. Finally, it is the minister concerned who approves it. According to sources privy to the development, the Zirakpur MC allegedly did not even carry out physical verification of the projects for issuing fire-safety no-objection certificate or giving permissions for sewerage and water connections and setting up of sewage treatment plant. In fact, even the Punjab and Haryana high court has directed the Punjab local bodies department to carry out physical checking of all real estate projects before issuing the completion certificate.When contacted for comment, Gill said: “I can’t say anything off the top of my head and will have to cross-check the cases. These days, please talk about Covid-19 only.” Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary, local government, Punjab, said: “I am not aware of the issue, but will definitely look into it.” However, Mohali additional deputy commissioner Aashika Jain, who is also the administrator of the Zirakpur MC, said: “We will conduct an inquiry into the matter. If any misuse of power is found, strict action will be taking against the official concerned.”Harish Gupta, president, Builders Association Zirakpur, said: “As per norms, after completing the basic infrastructure and common facilities, we complete the buildings in parts and apply for partial completion certificate to the competent authority, which is the Zirakpur MC. After that, it is the prerogative of the civic body to issue the certificates, and how they issue it is up to them.”Meanwhile, a senior official of the civic body, on the condition of anonymity, said: “We have seen that some builders take completion certificate from the civic body and end up cheating people. During the launch of project, they promise the allottees some returns till they the handing over of possession/completion certificate. However, without completing the project, they are issued certificates in connivance with officials and stop making payments to the allottees, which increases litigations and harassment of the common man.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/zirakpur-mc-chief-under-scanner-for-issuing-completion-certificates-sans-authority/story-VHz7zxL1qtSWJ1IClKsEgP.html

05-05-2020||Lucknow||Religious activities via loudspeakers restricted in UP: Govt to HC||The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday submitted before Allahabad high court that religious activity of any religious group through loudspeaker was restricted across the state in view of the ongoing lockdown imposed to check spread of Covid-19.The submission was made while the court was hearing via videoconference a public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by Ghazipur MP Afzal Ansari in which it was alleged that the district administration had banned azaan (call to prayer) in Ghazipur.In this regard, the affidavit filed by additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Awasthi clarified that Ghazipur district had been declared a corona hotspot, hence as per the guidelines issued by union ministry of home affairs on March 24, 2020 certain restrictions were imposed. “Since ‘azaan’ is made on a loudspeaker, it has been restricted in Ghazipur,” he stated in the affidavit. Keeping the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the state government on record, a division bench comprising chief justice Govind Mathur and justice Ajit Kumar directed to hear this matter on May 5 (Tuesday) through videoconferencing. As per additional advocate general (AAG) Manish Goyal, the petitioner’s allegation of violation of fundamental right of religious freedom has been specifically responded by stating that Article 25 of the Constitution, which gives fundamental right to freedom of religion, provides that it is subject to public order, morality and health. In the PIL, the MP had alleged that all of a sudden from April 24 onwards it was found that azaan from mosques was prohibited by local administration and police and that if anyone dared to make azaan, they would be booked under National Security Act. In light of this, the MP requested the court to allow azaan by only one person i. e. ‘muezzin’ (the person appointed at mosques for making call to prayers) from the respective mosques within the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/religious-activities-via-loudspeakers-restricted-in-up-govt-to-hc/story-DEE0qKZcnifExkR6vX8Q3L.html

05-05-2020||Mumbai||Maha cuts its development spending by 67% this year||The state government on Monday announced a 67% cut in its spending for developmental works this fiscal, in view of the estimated revenue losses of more than ₹40,000 crore in March and April 2020 owing to the Covid-19 outbreak. The state, expecting the cumulative losses to be more than ₹50,000 crore in the current fiscal, has also decided to not take up new development schemes and scrap or defer the schemes that can be put on hold.Among other measures, the government has also decided to stop recruitment for government jobs, meaning that recruitment underway for 35,000 posts is unlikely now. Recruitments in the public health and medical education departments, however, have been excluded from the diktat. Around 1.90 lakh posts (of around 17 lakh sanctioned posts) in the state government are vacant.Chief secretary Ajoy Mehta issued the government resolution on Monday, announcing the cut in expenditure on development schemes and curbs on recruitments. “Only 33% of the outlay for the schemes will be released in the ongoing financial year. The departments should take a review of the ongoing schemes and take call on their deferment or the cancellation. This will be applicable even to those schemes decided by the state cabinet before March 31, 2020. No new schemes be proposed,” the GR stated.According to officials from the finance department, only 33% of the total outlay for the scheme expenditure of around ₹1.15 lakh crore will be released within the financial year. “Yes, unfortunately this means we are spending ₹70,000 crore less on social and development schemes. The amount is roughly equivalent to the drop we expect in the revenue receipt in the financial year,” the official said.The decision, however, will not be applicable to the Covid-19 pandemic -related expenditure by departments such as public health, medical education, relief and rehabilitation, and food and civil supplies. The estimated expenditure on battling Covid-19 by these departments is more than ₹800 crore, including ₹450 crore by the public health department. The departments have also been directed to not undertake any new construction (of roads, bridges or buildings) or even give them technical approval. The departments with corpus lying unused in banks have been warned to give the deposit back to the government or face inquiry.The state government has seen a revenue losses of over ₹40,000 crore in March and April owing to the lockdown, which has resulted in industrial and commercial activities coming to a complete halt. The state government expects a similar trend of a drop in revenue for the next two-three months. It has already demanded financial assistance of ₹50,000 crore from the Centre and the permission to raise greater amount of loans. Meanwhile, the state government has sustained estimated losses of ₹2,800 crore expected from excise duty and sales tax on liquor in the oast 40 days of the lockdown. “This will affect our annual revenue target of ₹19,225 crore. We expect an unusual surge in liquor consumption for the next few days after liquor shops have opened today, before it stabilises to its average sale,” said Kantilal Umap, excise commissioner. The state government has said that liquor shops will begin to operate in the next couple of days after preparations in terms of logistics and stocks. “Although we have issued an order to keep liquor shops open in all colour-coded zones, except containment zones, district collectors have all rights to decide otherwise. Nagpur and Aurangabad collectors enquired with the government if they could continue to keep liquor shops shut,” said Bhushan Gagarani, principal secretary, Maharashtra government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-cuts-its-development-spending-by-67-this-year/story-fiw6SvSKYQHpmvD04gQQMJ.html

A function was held to pay tribute to Col Ashutosh Sharma, Major Anuj Sood, Naik Rajesh Kumar and Lance Naik Dinesh Singh. An Army spokesperson said that Northern Army Commander Lt Gen YK Joshi, Lt Gen BS Raju Chinar Corps Commander and all ranks paid homage to the soldiers and in a show of solidarity, representatives from other security agencies also joined in to pay their last respects. “Col Ashutosh Sharma and his team were leading a counter-terrorist operation in Chanjimul village of Kupwara district. In a valiant effort to save innocent civilian lives, while putting their own lives in grave danger, they eliminated two terrorists in the operation.

05-05-2020||Mumbai||Maha tally touches 14,541; city’s virus cases at 9,310||Maharashtra on Monday recorded a single-day jump of 1,567 new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, taking the state’s tally to 14,541. However, according to the state health department, Maharashtra recorded 771 new infections, but also added 796 cases of the past few days, which had been updated on the website of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The state also reported 35 deaths, taking the toll to 583. Of the new cases, Mumbai recorded 510, taking its tally to 9,310, while the toll rose to 361 with 18 deaths on Monday. As per the Central government’s directive, the state has started referring to figures from the ICMR portal and hence the difference has been adjusted, said state health department officials.As Maharashtra from Monday entered the third phase of the lockdown with certain relaxations, even in the red zones, to spur its stalled economy, the administration is faced with the tall order of keeping Covid-19 cases under control, especially in Mumbai, Pune and Thane regions — all hotspots. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has instructed the administration to ensure strict implementation of the lockdown, stating that majority of the districts in the state should be brought into the green zone by the end of May.Monday witnessed scenes of crowding in Maharashtra’s major cities, outside vegetable markets, shops selling essential items and liquor shops, after the state government allowed it. Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, and Pune districts have nearly 90% of the state’s Covid-19 cases.Thackeray, according to senior officials, has taken a serious note of the crowding on the first day of the curbs being relaxed. He has directed the district administration and police department to enforce social-distancing measures. The last time such scenes were witnessed, Thackeray had immediately directed authorities to exclude Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune and Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) from the relaxation. A total of 1,76,323 coronavirus tests have been held across the state.“We have given some relaxations to start economic activities. But it doesn’t mean that the lockdown is lifted. The district administration and police should ensure strict implementation of the lockdown in any condition and should ensure that their respective zones become green zones at the earliest,” Thackeray was quoted in a statement by the chief minister’s office. The statement from CMO quoted Thackeray: “The scenes witnessed in some cities are quite grave as citizens are roaming freely after certain curbs were lifted.”In a meeting held via video conference with divisional commissioners, district collectors, municipal commissioners, medical officers, and police chiefs on Sunday evening, Thackeray said that the easy part of enforcing lockdown is over now. “Imposing a lockdown was easy, but the real test would begin now with relaxations being given,” Thackeray said. He added that he now wants “results” in the coming days.According to the chief minister’s office (CMO), the CM has directed the state administration to convert a large part of the state’s districts into green zones by the end of this month. Maharashtra currently has 14 districts in the red zone, 16 districts in the orange zone, and six districts in the green zone.State health minister Rajesh Tope, who took stock of the situation and preparedness in Pune city, Pune district, Solapur and Satara districts, said that the number of cases in the districts could increase. He directed district authorities to increase the number of beds, institutional quarantine facilities, keeping into account a possible spike in the cases.Thackeray further said that while some industries have been allowed in districts that fall in the orange and green zones, it needed to be ensured that nobody from the red zone comes in these zones and spreads the infection. The district borders will continue to remain closed and the movement of people, who are stuck due to lockdown, would be done by following the norms strictly, he added.A senior Mantralaya bureaucrat said that there would have been a point where restrictions would have to be lifted. “How long can we keep the economy stalled? The coronavirus is a serious battle, but it will die down in a few months. However, it will take more than a year to put the economy back on track. The curbs are not lifted so that people can go out as nothing has happened. The police and civic body will have to enforce measures in a stringent manner; the CM has already told them so,” the officer said not wishing to be named.While the Maharashtra government has allowed establishments dealing with non-essential commodities to function with conditions even in Mumbai, there is still lack of clarity on-ground.In its revised guidelines on Sunday, the state government has allowed stand-alone shops and establishments dealing with non-essential services to open. However, no more than five shops (excluding the establishments dealing with essential goods) in a lane can open at a time. These establishments, will, therefore, be regulated by the local authorities i.e the municipal corporations.A Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) ward officer from the eastern suburbs of the city said that the civic body will frame policy guidelines on this in a day or two.“The opening of the shops is subject to permissions from the local authority, so as of Monday, establishments dealing with non-essentials goods have not started,” he said. “The opening of shops will depend on the situation on-ground in every ward. There is no clarity as to which shops have to be opened, if suppose there are 50 shops in a lane.”The city has 24 wards in total. Two more ward officers from BMC that HT spoke to, corroborated that there are no guidelines on opening the shops yet. A senior official from BMC also said that a decision is yet to taken by the municipal commissioner, as of Monday evening.A shopkeeper dealing with garments in Matunga’s King’s Circle also said that there is no clarity on how to apply for permission to re-start their shops. “There are close to 30 shops in our lane. Which will be given priority? And how will they define a lane?” he asked. According to the Sunday guidelines, malls, market complexes and markets continue to be shut in the city.Meanwhile, the state government has not allowed private offices to function in the MMR, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Malegaon, although the Centre has allowed offices to resume with 33% workforce even in red zones starting Monday. Even government offices in these five regions can function with a 5% workforce, the state government said.In its new guidelines, the state government has allowed construction activities to resume, however, they will have to ensure that the workforce is available in-situ.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-tally-touches-14-541-city-s-virus-cases-at-9-310/story-kwPiuvYVR4jkL7xUphPJOL.html

Meanwhile, deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma has confirmed that construction-related works were being carried out at the site where they have tested positive.“The construction work has stopped at the site and the area has been declared as a containment zone,” DC said. Earlier home and health minister Anil Vij has also expressed displeasure on the state government’s decision to allow the opening of shops and other non-essential activities amid a rise in the number of cases.“I’m worried as we cannot send police to every shop and ask them to maintain social distancing.

05-05-2020||Delhi||Liquor stores Delhi’s first port of call||Hundreds of people lined up before government-run liquor shops since Monday morning, jostling, pushing and pulling at each other in complete defiance of social distancing norms, as the fight against Covid-19 entered its third phase with the government providing considerable relaxation in lockdown curbs as part of a phase-wise exit plan. At many places, the police had to lathicharge and at some others, shops were shut to prevent a riot-like situation. The Delhi government had allowed opening of standalone liquor shops between 9am and 6.30pm, according to directives issued by the Union home ministry after the national lockdown was extended till May 17. Extraordinary scenes of chaos were witnessed as queues, longer than a kilometre, were seen before liquor stores in Ashram, Govindpuri, Vasant Vihar, Mayur Vihar and many other places. At most places, the buyers not only defied social distancing norms, many were not wearing masks. This prompted the special branch of Delhi Police to suggest that the timings for the sale of liquor be extended to avoid crowding at outlets. The sale of liquor had been banned during the operation of the lockdown till May 3. On Monday, 349 cases of Covid-19 were reported in Delhi, taking the total to 4,898. As the numbers outside stores in east, central and south-east Delhi swelled, the police ordered liquor shops to shut. Undeterred, the crowds were seen racing to other liquor shops in the vicinity to try their luck.At the Lajpat Nagar flyover, near Sriniwaspuri, the queue of buyers caused a traffic jam, prompting police to lathicharge the crowd several times during the day.The situation at the start of the day was under control. When the shutters of a liquor shop in Pitampura’s Varun Niketan opened at 11 am, the crowd cheered. They took photographs, hailed the decision and some even said that the coronavirus would be a thing of the past.Outside all liquor stores, people eagerly waited with shopping bags, backpacks and gurney bags to hoard bottles.“When I was walking to open the shutter, I felt like a celebrity. We have not had a free minute; people have been continuously coming since the morning. Two policemen are stationed around the shop to ensure that people stick to queues,” said Dhruv Kumar, owner of a store in Varun Niketan.The crowd was a mix of Delhi residents, as seen from the SUVs, sedans, motorcycles and cycle rickshaws parked in the vicinity. Some had even walked around four to five kilometres to the nearest shop. On the roads, people inquired one other about crowds outside other shops in the vicinity.“People have suddenly become helpful and are guiding each other about the location of the shops. I usually drink whisky and beer but today (Monday), even if I get vodka, I am going to buy it. The government cannot close shops indefinitely,” said Gopal Dong, a Delhi University student.However, within an hour of the shops opening, lines got longer and the people, more restless. The crowding outside the counters forced the authorities to shut shops and turn customers away. Delhi police officers said that by around 3pm, almost 90% of the shops were shut. They will open on Tuesday.As word spread of shops being shut, those waiting in lines started hoarding, fearing that the liquor stores would not be opened again. A store in Karol Bagh shut by 2pm due to massive crowding, while similar incidents were reported from Shahdara and other parts of east Delhi.The joint commissioner of police (eastern range), Alok Kumar, said, “We did not resort to lathicharge but used mild force to disperse the crowd. Our officers were on the ground and were continuously in touch with the shop owners to remind them that they weren’t following social distancing rules. The few shops that were open today shut on their own. We will follow the government’s order and ensure that people are disciplined in queues.”In the evening, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that shops where social distancing norms are not followed will be shut. He urged residents to follow the norms to ensure that the relaxations continue.“I have heard reports on incidents of chaos and crowding outside certain shops. These shops were not opened for a limited time; they will open again tomorrow and the day after. I am concerned about your health and the health of your families. We want to slowly resume activities, but we will have to seal area if social distancing is not followed, for you and your safety,” Kejriwal said at a press briefing.Mushtaq Ali, a licensed vendor in east Delhi’s Trilokpuri, said that soon after the Delhi government issued the order on Sunday, they were given a set of guidelines by the state excise department on the conditions of running operations again. All those at the counters were asked to mandatorily wear masks and gloves. The shop owners were also asked to ensure social distancing outside the shops.The Centre had directed shopkeepers to ensure a gap of at least two yards between each person.“People are standing in queues, but they are barely maintaining distance. We had marked circles to ensure there is a distance between customers, but because a lot of people are turning up, no one seems to be following that,” Ali said.In south Delhi’s Vasant Vihar, the long queues became a reason for major concern among the residents, who had managed to curtail movement of outsiders to a minimum. The Vasant Vihar Welfare Association took to social media and informed authorities about a crowd of several hundreds outside a shop.The queue at a liquor shop in C-Block market, on Paschimi Marg, also led to traffic jams in the area. In the Basant Lok market, shop owners restricted purchases to two bottles per person. “It was a disappointing move by the government to allow liquor shops to open. The number of cases is still on the rise and you are risking the safety of your citizens like this. Hours before the shops opened, people started lining up here,” said Sumukhi Das, a resident of Vasant Vihar C-Block.In southwest Delhi’s Palam Colony, people were seen carrying crates of beer bottles from the shops and filling the boot of their cars. “Last time, the shops just closed without any warning. Maybe if we were given some time, we would have stocked up. The government should have anticipated this rush and made arrangements accordingly,” said Monty Singh, a resident of Palam Village, who bought five crates of beers and a bottle of rum.Meanwhile, senior Delhi police officers said the police district DCPs are holding meetings with shop owners and have asked them to rope in more volunteers to ensure that such problems do not arise on Tuesday. More shops are expected to open on Tuesday.“The police dispersed the crowd here thrice. I also got hit on my knee. That pain is bearable. I will return tomorrow. We will die if we do not get liquor soon,” a rickshaw puller, who was returning home empty-handed after waiting for four hours in Sriniwaspuri, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/liquor-stores-delhi-s-first-port-of-call/story-tkuJAtP6MDM3LnKvHtaOaM.html
05-05-2020||City||16 vegetable sellers among 26 Sonepat patients; No community spread in Jhajjar||Among the 26 corona carriers detected in Sonepat, 16 are vegetable sellers who frequented Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi. Jhajjar and Sonepat districts have witnessed spurt in Covid-19 cases in past one week and emerged as new hotspots. Sonepat has reported 46 cases in the last two days, while Jhajjar has seen 53 infections since last Monday. Not too long ago, both these districts bordering Delhi were being praised for tackling the situation and containing the contagion, but the visits of locals to the national capital exposed them to the infection.Of 53 cases seen in Jhajjar, 34 cases are linked to Delhi’s Azadpur Mandi. After vegetable sellers tested positive in Jhajjar, Sonepat health officials also focused on testing those visiting the mandi.SAMPLES BROUGHT BY MOBILE VANSeven vegetable sellers from Gayaspur village, five from Pubnera, two each from Ram Nagar and Bega villages of district’s Ganaur block have been shifted by the Sonepat health department to the isolation ward of Bhagat Phool Singh medical college in Khanpur Kalan. Sonepat Civil Surgeon BK Rajoura said all these cases were detected after a mobile van visited the villages of Ganaur block and took samples of vegetable sellers, who frequented Azadpur Mandi. “We targeted the vegetable sellers after many such vendors were found infected with Covid-19 in Jhajjar. The administration handed over a list of vegetable sellers to us and we visited them to collect their samples,” the civil surgeon added. The remaining cases include a female officer of Delhi Police, three women and two men from Sonepat and four men from Kundli.WE ARE CONDUCTING RANDOM SAMPLING OF 300 PERSONS DAILY: JHAJJAR CIVIL SURGEONRuling out the possibility of community transmission in Jhajjar, civil surgeon Randeep Singh Punia said the customers of vegetable sellers tested in the district were not found infected.“We have been conducting random sampling of over 300 people per day and none of the customers, who had bought vegetables from these vendors, were found infected. I can assure that there is no community transmission in the district yet,” he added. Health officials also took samples of vegetable sellers in Bhiwani, Dadri and Hisar, but none of them tested positive for the virus there as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/16-vegetable-sellers-among-26-sonepat-patients-no-community-spread-in-jhajjar/story-hpH4q04VN9tPTn6LAlSSJO.html
05-05-2020||City||Coronavirus lockdown: Ludhiana doctors raise concern over ‘poor quality PPE kits’||Day after a former house surgeon tested positive for coronavirus, a surgeon of Ludhiana civil hospital has highlighted the issue of the poor quality of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits issued to the doctors. In a letter referred to civil surgeon, Dr Milind Verma said the kits are of substandard quality, eyewear and shoe cores are torn, thus, exposing the staff to infection. In the letter, Dr Verma also mentioned an incident wherein a hospital staff had fallen unconscious while she was wearing a PPE kit and collecting samples.Meanwhile, civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said that soon after receiving the letter, the PPE kits were replaced by the officials concerned.DOCTORS AWAIT INSTALLATION OF ACsThe doctors deployed on coronavirus duty at the civil hospital have also complained that wearing PPE kits amid the rising temperatures takes a toll on their health. “Recently, deputy commissioner (DC) Pradeep Agrawal had visited the unit and giveb air conditioners (ACs) to the hospital. It has been over a week, but the devices have not been installed due to which we are forced to work in the extreme heat,” they said.Earlier, authenticity and accuracy of rapid testing kits had come under the scanner after three people, who had tested positive during the rapid test, were found negative for the coronavirus in the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test.After conducting 350 tests, the district administration had suspended the much-hyped testing process following government directions on April 22.97 ACTIVE CASES IN DISTRICTDC Pradeep Agrawal said that presently, a total of 97 active coronavirus patients (all residents of Ludhiana) are left and their health is improving. “Till date, the district administration has collected a total of 3,253 samples out of which 128 (110 from Ludhiana and 18 from other districts) are positive. Eight patients have been cured and five deaths have been reported so far,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/coronavirus-lockdown-ludhiana-doctors-raise-concern-over-poor-quality-ppe-kits/story-0kVGwZOWVmSyNMrpPGPu8O.html
05-05-2020||Delhi||Air quality remains ‘satisfactory’ as Delhi warms up to economic activity||Pollution levels in Delhi remained in the ‘satisfactory’ zone on Monday even as many government and private offices opened with a third of their staff on the first day of the two-week exit from the lockdown, because of which there was increased activity and traffic presence in the city.Experts said it will take some time to analyse the impact of resumption of activity on the pollution levels. High wind speed and frequent spells of rain will, however, help keep pollution in check for the rest of the week.According to Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) bulletin released at 9pm, the average air quality index (AQI) on Monday was 90 ( in the ‘satisfactory’ zone). At 93, the AQI on Sunday was also in the ‘satisfactory’ zone. The last time Delhi experienced ‘satisfactory’ air quality was on April 27 when the index was recorded at 89.“Pollution levels in the city during the lockdown period have mostly fluctuated between ‘moderate’ and ‘satisfactory’ levels, mainly because of no traffic movement or activity, apart from the good weather and frequent rainfall. Since it was just the first day of relaxations coming into effect, any impact on overall pollution levels will only be reflected late night or tomorrow (Tuesday) morning,” a senior CPCB official, who did not wish to be named, said.The official said an increase in the number of vehicles on roads may degrade air quality. But good wind speed expected over the next two days is likely to mitigate the detrimental effects.According to scientists at India Meteorological Department (IMD), on Sunday evening the wind speed went up to 58 kmph, the highest for Delhi this summer. The high wind speed and rainfall helped push the air quality from ‘moderate’ to ‘satisfactory’.“The air quality is likely to improve further on Tuesday, with the wind speed expected to go up to 40-50 kmph between Monday night and Tuesday morning. Delhi has had six western disturbances in April, as against the usual three to four, resulting in frequent thunderstorms and rainfall. We are expecting another western disturbance to hit northwestern India between May 10 and May 12 and it will result in rain and gusty winds,” Kuldeep Srivastava, head, IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said.According to experts, since Monday was just the first day of more private vehicles plying on roads and economic activity slowly starting to pick up, the impact of the emissions will take a while to reflect in the pollution levels.“So far we don’t know the quantum of the vehicles plying on the roads. Any significant increase in the traffic will impact NOx levels and there will be some impact on PM 2.5 levels as well. But we will need to analyse data for at least a week to establish a trend,” Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said.Roychowdhury said that so far, the prominent pollutant in the air was PM 10 (mainly generated from dust) because intrusion of dust is higher during summers.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the union government’s air quality monitoring and forecasting wing, air quality may improve to ‘good’ level by Tuesday. “Rainfall has resulted in washing out of pollutants and air quality is expected to improve over the next two days,” its bulletin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/air-quality-remains-satisfactory-as-delhi-warms-up-to-economic-activity/story-dUynzYT8jyXdWcdtL2DMEI.html
05-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi set to lose Rs 645 crore in revenue as liquor shops remained shut for 43 days||The national lockdown since March 25 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) led to Delhi government losing around Rs 645 crore in revenue from the sale of alcohol, when calculated on the basis of revised estimates in the 2019-20 state budget, senior government officials said Monday.They adding that the excise department was preparing a full report on the exact revenue loss incurred by the ban on the sale of liquor for over 40 days.In terms of income, alcohol accounts for around 14.1% of the city government’s total revenue projections for 2020-21.For 2020-21, the city-state projected a total revenue of around Rs 6,279 crore through the sale of liquor, compared to the revised estimate of around Rs 5,480 crore for the previous fiscal. In 2018-19, Delhi earned around Rs 5,007 crore through the sale of liquor, according to budget documents.These figures highlight the importance to the state government of liquor sales in the Capital.“The revenue loss during the lockdown has been estimated on the basis of 2019-20 revised budget estimates because the lockdown was already in place when we stepped into fiscal 2020-21. So, the projected revenue for this period made less sense when it came to taking a base figure,” one of the officials cited above said on condition of anonymity.With the conditional scaling down of lockdown restrictions in non-containment zones, 150 liquor shops returned to business in Delhi after 43 days. These shops are under the direct control of the government and have L-6 and L-8 licences, which allow them to sell India-made foreign liquor (IMFL) and country liquor.“In case there is a demand for imported liquor in a certain area, the L-6 shops are allowed to maintain limited stock of foreign liquor with permission of the excise department. Other than that, foreign liquor is formally covered under L-10 license category, which can be availed by both government departments or private enterprises. But there is hardly any L-10 license shop in the city which is not located in a market, mall or other public space that comes under the ambit of restrictions.”An excise department officer who asked not to be named said that the city has 864 licensed liquor shops, which includes 389 shops owned by private individuals.A senior government official said, the government collects taxes from both type of shops and the tax component depends on the brand of liquor in question. For any given brand, the tax component is the same in a private shop or a government shop. Private shops have to pay higher license renewal fee, but that doesn’t affect the retail price, tax component and margin for any brand.Of the 475 shops owned by the government, only 150 qualify as “stand-alone” shops (not located in markets or malls) that operate with L-6 and L-8 licences.Apart from these, the revenue from 884 bars and restaurants that serve liquor also contribute significantly to the government exchequer. These continue to remain closed, said third government official, adding: “When it comes to opening 150 shops, they may witness higher than average sales. But these shops can open only between 9am and 6.30pm till May 17. So, it is difficult to estimate the numbers or the revenue gain at this juncture.”Liquor shops in Delhi were last open on March 21. March 22 was a dry day because of the “janta curfew” call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the shops were shut for the two days owing to an order by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. On March 25, the nationwide lockdown kicked in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-set-to-lose-645-cr-in-revenue-as-liquor-shops-remained-shut-for-43-days/story-d4qun7uC72v5MeNSe9BAnO.html
05-05-2020||Delhi||Demand for AC repairs surges, technicians scramble for spare parts||With the Delhi government allowing electricians and other self-employed people to resume operations amid a national lockdown to control the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), there was a surge in the demand for air-conditioner (AC) repairs and maintenance requests on Monday, prompting even some electricians to double up as AC technicians in the Capital.The self-employed technicians in Delhi began responding to customer requests even as representative of some AC manufacturers and sellers said they were not accepting repair and maintenance requests due to the lockdown restrictions.Dinesh Kumar (45), an electrician in Mayur Vihar, said he received four calls on Sunday evening for AC repairs across homes, adding that the uptick in work at his service centre came after a period of one-and-a-half months.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal locked down the national capital to contain the Covid-19 outbreak, which has killed at least 250,000 people across the world, on March 23, days before the central government announced similar restrictions.On Monday morning, Kumar sent a team of workers to carry out the repair and maintenance work.“During the lockdown period, we got a few orders, but it was all minor work, such as fixing tube lights or repairing plug points. Finally, we are now getting big orders,” he said.Those running AC repair shops said they get the bulk of their work orders in March, when temperatures begin to rise, but the Covid-19 lockdown this year didn’t allow any activity. Now that work orders have begun coming in, the technicians are preparing for a surge in requests and concerned about arranging spare parts.Amit Aggarwal (53), a resident of Vasant Kunj, said he had no option during the lockdown but to conduct basic maintenance of AC units in his house on his own. “Most AC manufacturing companies had suspended repair and maintenance services due to the lockdown. We couldn’t call a company expert to do the repair and servicing. Even the local shops were closed,” said Aggarwal.According to technicians, the most common repair work in ACs is to replenish its cooling gas or repair coils, in case of damage, which results in a leakage of the gas. But with most spare parts shops closed, especially in wholesale markets, it is now proving to be a challenge.Despite public demand, many local AC repair and service shops are not allowed to open as they are located in markets. They are taking orders over the phone and sending their staffers to the work site.Nitish Gaba, who runs an AC repair shop in east Delhi, said: “We can’t open the shop right now. We are getting orders to repair ACs, but it is difficult to arrange spare parts. We are also finding it difficult to procure the gas used in ACs, as we usually bought it from the shops providing spare parts.”Mukesh Kashyap (29), an electrician who owns a store in Rohini, said he has to source materials, such as motor parts, which has not been possible as not all shops have reopened.“I got a call from a client to repair and install their AC. The motor was not functional. I had to call up several people for four days before I could get the spare part for repair. This way, even if we get work, I don’t know how much we will be able to do,” said Kashyap.Aamir Khan, who repairs ACs at his shop at Bhogal, said his work took a hit this year as people were still reluctant to allow outsiders in their houses. He said they were also being stopped by some police officials while on the way to work. “People are letting us enter their houses only after making several enquires. Customers are asking for our names, whether we are coming from a containment zone and insisting that we do the work either on the terrace or in the balcony, but not inside the house,” he said, adding that he was facing a financial crunch due to the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/demand-for-ac-repairs-surges-technicians-scramble-for-spare-parts/story-ZM7z20Xzcs9D8Zw0k0sAiO.html
05-05-2020||Delhi||Delhi CM warns of sealing if social distancing norms not followed||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that his government would be forced to shut shops -- opened under conditional scaling down of the lockdown restrictions applicable till May 17 – in case of violation of social distancing norms. Kejriwal was reacting to the chaos that followed the opening of government-run liquor shops in the city after 40 days of the national lockdown enforced by the centre to curb the spread of Covid-19. Many liquor shops had to be shut and at some places police had to disperse huge crowds gathered before them. An official said a liquor store had to be closed in Mayur Vihar in east Delhi. Similar cases were reported from north and central Delhi after buyers started queueing up in front of the shops since morning.  “I was a little disappointed today. Large crowds assembled in front of some shops. People violated social distancing. Who will suffer due to this? You (people) will suffer. Imagine if someone in that crowd was infected. Then so many people ended up risking not just their lives but also their family members’. Such violations are unacceptable,” said the chief minister.Till Sunday evening, there were 4,549 Covid-19 cases in Delhi; 64 people have died of the disease so far. The Delhi CM said, “Why this rush? Shops will be open tomorrow and the days that follow. But if we come across violations of social distancing anywhere, we will have to seal that area and withdraw the relaxations. We will be left with no option but to take strong measures.” Kejriwal’s warning came even as union health minister Harsh Vardhan asked for the liquor stores to remain closed. “It would not be right and wise to continue with a decision, taken knowingly or unknowingly, as its adverse effects have already become apparent. The Delhi government should review its decision.” The chief minister also wanted store owners to behave responsibly. “For how long will we under be lockdown? It’s been one-and-a-half months already. We must act responsibly. And if there are reports of violations in a particular shop, we will seal that shop. Shopkeepers will have to take responsibility. If there’s report of violation in any area, we will seal that area,” said Kejriwal, emphasizing that Delhi is trying hard to restart business and commerce activities in a limited way within the ambit of the central government’s order.The chief minister said that people should continue wearing masks whenever they go outdoors, maintain social distance and keep washing their hands with soap or use sanitiser at regular intervals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-have-to-shut-shops-seal-areas-if-social-distancing-is-not-maintained-warns-kejriwal/story-XBCj5lBORDhKdiyJP95ikM.html
05-05-2020||Delhi||No access to devices, many Delhi EWS students in a fix over online tests||For over a month, Malkeet Singh, a resident of Tilak Nagar, has been trying to arrange a device that would help his two kids attend online classes that are being conducted by their schools during the Covid-19 lockdown. Singh’s daughter (7) and son (11) have not attended a single online class as of Monday.Singh, a contractual driver with a private firm, has had no work since Prime Minister Narendra Modi put in place a countrywide lockdown on March 25 to check the spread of Covid-19. His children are enrolled in two private schools in Rajouri Gardens and Paschim Vihar — in Class 2 and Class 6 respectively — under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota. “We don’t have a smartphone at home. I did not even know that a smartphone will become so important for us during the lockdown. I’ve not earned a single penny since March and that’s why could not arrange a phone for my kids. Now my daughter’s school has sent a message stating that they will hold online unit tests from Wednesday. I don’t know what to do? I’m afraid my daughter’s performance will suffer,” he said.Many parents whose children are enrolled in private schools across the city under the EWS quota have found themselves in a tough spot ever since the lockdown came into force. While some, like Singh, don’t have the means to help their children attend online classes, others have fallen back on the help of their neighbours or relatives to arrange such devices.Several private schools in Delhi have announced that they will hold online unit tests, adding to the woes of such parents and students. “It’s even more difficult for parents like us who have never been to a school. We can’t even make our kids study from books. How will she take the tests without attending classes,” Singh said.A Class 8 student enrolled in a private school in South Delhi under the EWS quota said that his unit tests are also slated to start from Thursday. “I use my neighbour’s smartphone to listen to the recorded classes every alternate day. It feels embarrassing to ask for help daily. Now the school is saying they will take the unit test in the form of Multiple Choice Questions. I don’t know how will I manage to take the tests,” said the 15-year-old, whose father, a daily wage labourer, has been jobless due to the lockdown.Delhi government’s Directorate of Education (DoE) last week had directed all private schools to provide access to online classes and e-learning material to EWS students enrolled with them. However, several schools said that despite providing access, some of their students are not being able to attend online classes.Alka Kapur, principal of Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh, said that some of their EWS students are not being able to attend classes despite them provided with links and invites. “We are calling them constantly and requesting their families to approach us for help. Many parents are not willing to come up. Some students are stuck in their native villages because of the lockdown. It won’t be possible for them to take the tests. We will decide the next step for them soon ,” she said.DoE director Binay Bhushan said that schools will have to take the responsibility and help EWS students by all available means amid the lockdown. “They should come up with ideas to take online unit tests of EWS students, who are facing logistical challenges,” he said.Schools say they have no choice but to re-conduct exams for those who are not able to appear for the tests now. “We will access the attendance in these tests post lockdown and re-conduct it for those who could not appear due to logistical challenges,” said Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu School in Rohini.An NGO Justice for All had last week filed a petition in the Delhi High Court demanding free devices for EWS students amid the lockdown. “The court has asked us to submit a list of such students in Delhi private schools. We will submit it by tomorrow (Tuesday),” said advocate Shikha Bagga. Meanwhile, some private schools are helping their EWS students with logistics. For instance, Springdales School in Pusa Road has provided smartphones to some of their EWS students. “Most of these children and their parents did not know how to download apps and create email ids. Some of our faculty members, who had extra phones at home, have handed them over to students in need. Almost all our students have devices now,” said Jasmeet Chandok, head of the social work department at the school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-access-to-devices-many-delhi-ews-students-in-a-fix-over-online-tests/story-BWu990MkAZQjWyo3Gq7bqJ.html
05-05-2020||Delhi||Two branches of Apeejay School sealed for hiking fees illegally||The Delhi government on Monday sealed the two branches of Apeejay School in Saket and Sheikh Sarai for charging hiked fees from students in violation of the directions issued by its education department.The Directorate of Education (DoE), on April 18, had issued an order directing all private schools in Delhi not to revise their fee structure without seeking prior approval. The schools were also asked to charge only tuition fee from the students amid the lockdown. The DoE had warned the schools of action under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, enforced in the city amid the Covid-19 pandemic.In an order issued on Monday, deputy director education (south) Arvind Kumar said, “It’s been reported that the management of Apeejay School (Saket) and Apeejay School (Sheikh Sarai) are not complying with the directions issued by the education department and they are directions by the way of unauthorised fee hike [sic].”Hindustan Times had, last month, reported that the DoE had issued an order against Apeejay Schools, Saket and Sheikh Sarai, for illegally increasing the fee without taking cognisance of the prevailing situation. The parents’ association in the school had alleged that they hiked the fee by 15-20% in April this year.On Monday, the DoE in its order said that it’s received a recommendation from the ADM (south) office for sealing the buildings of these two schools and lodging an FIR against the management of both the schools. The recommendations were later approved by the office of Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. Following this, the buildings were sealed by the DoE officials on Monday evening. However, no FIR was lodged by the time this report was filed. Saurabh Bhardwaj, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA from Greater Kailash, also tweeted about the sealing of the two branches of the school. “Two APEEJAY School branches at Sheikh Sarai & Saket were sealed today by Govt of Delhi. Much appreciated action of Sealing by DM, South and Dept of Education...APEEJAY school had been violating all kinds of norms of Healthy Education system. Inspite of audits showing crores of surplus money in accounts, it was illegally arm twisting parents for increased fee [sic],” he tweeted.Denying all charges against them, the principals of both the branches have issued a statement saying, “ We have all requisite approvals from the DoE to charge the fee for the academic year 2019-20. We have certainly not forced or harassed our parents to pay the fee. In fact, we held out a helping hand to those in need, with scholarships. Almost 100% of parents of Apeejay School, Panchsheel Park, have paid the academic year 2019-20 fee, voluntarily and a majority have also paid the present monthly tuition fee.”“Almost all the parents are with us and understand the situation. Only a handful of parents have been complaining, motivated by vested interests. Unfortunately, the current force majeure situation has again prompted them to agitate on the fee issue,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/two-branches-of-apeejay-school-sealed-for-hiking-fees-illegally/story-HDJcbC86ZxD1EZlTpUPzqM.html

As a result of the alleged delay, he said contact tracing was getting delayed and the infection was multiplying rapidly.The Delhi government’s additional standing counsel Satyakam informed the court that the state government had passed an order on April 29, stopping sending samples to NIB, Noida, due to the delay of over 15 days forwarding test reports. He said the lab has samples coming in from across the country.He said samples were now being distributed among other government and private labs to ensure reports were received within 24-48 hours from the date of submission.He told the court that as of date, there are 23 accredited labs for Covid-19 testing in Delhi. Of these, 10 are under the public sector and 13 are private. The collective capacity of these labs is 3,000-3,500 tests per day, he said. Satyakam said that as on April 29, as many as 7,794 reports were pending, out of which 5,944 reports were with NIB, Noida. “Till the night of May 3, 3,790 reports are stated to be pending with accredited labs and the reports shall be received by today or maximum, by tomorrow. As on May 2, 9,226 reports were pending, but said figure has considerably reduced to 3,790 as on May 3, which itself reflects the government is cognisant of the delay in receiving reports and has dealt with the said situation without losing time,” he said on Monday.Following this, the court said it was satisfied with the remedial measures undertaken by the Delhi government to expedite receipt of reports and directed it to continue uploading the information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-tells-delhi-govt-to-ensure-test-reports-don-t-take-more-than-48-hours/story-Ra8fcxQLSZn56Xh9YCrfrI.html
05-05-2020||Delhi||20% increase in traffic on Monday, congestion limited to police pickets||Traffic on Delhi’s roads on Monday increased by around 20% over previous days but did not lead to any major congestion, traffic police said. Monday marked the start of the phased two-week-long exit from the lockdown, with many offices and businesses opening with up to a third of their staff, and movement of people and vehicles being allowed between 7 am and 7 pm. Traffic hold-ups were limited to peak hours around pickets where barricades were set up by the police to check documents and identity cards, officials said.By Monday evening, the traffic police helpline received just one call regarding a traffic jam in North Delhi. “A traffic hold-up was caused in the afternoon around 2:30 pm because police personnel were checking documents and passes of commuters near barricades placed on Lawrence Road. The traffic police in the area were informed and they ensured the congestion was eased,” a traffic police officer said. The traffic police also received one complaint about a minor snarl near Uttam Nagar on Najafgarh Road on micro-blogging siteTwitter.Taj Hassan, special commissioner, Delhi Traffic Police, said ”all congestions were limited to peak traffic hours in the morning and they eased out by the afternoon.” Hassan said no deployment of traffic personnel was required on the roads. “An increase of around 20% in vehicle volume was recorded on the roads, and this increase didn’t really make much difference. Since all areas in Delhi are in the ‘red zone’, we didn’t expect any traffic challenges on Monday.” said Hassan. Thus far during the lockdown, according to a second police officer who asked not to be identified, the traffic has been 10-15% of what it usually is. Starting Monday, domestic help, people providing laundry services, and electricians and plumbers were also allowed to work. Hassan said the traffic doesn’t warrant turning on all traffic lights; many are currently in blinker mode. “We are reviewing the situation, and will turn them into active mode if more vehicles ply on the roads.” A deputy commissioner of police, who did not wish to be identified, said that from Tuesday, checking norms will be eased at some junctions to avoid bottlenecks. “At some checkpoints, we were diverting all traffic to one carriageway to save manpower. We were opening just one lane for vehicles to pass through these points. From Tuesday, we’ll change this arrangement and open other lanes in the morning and evening to prevent congestion .” The traffic police will not issue fines to violators physically. “Our speed detection cameras will continue issuing fines to speeding motorists. The average speed of vehicles is expected to decrease once the number of vehicles on the roads goes up,” Hassan said.In the first 35 days of the lockdown, from March 23 to April 26, more than 5.07 lakh motorists were caught speeding by the speed detection cameras across the city. It was not yet known as to how many people were challaned on Monday as the police don’t share daily updates. No reports of any accidents also emerged. till late in the night||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/20-increase-in-traffic-on-monday-congestion-limited-to-police-pickets/story-Xbt8yxaH9cFQBWjxkViRCL.html

05-05-2020||Mumbai||In first suspected case of Covid-19 among wild animals in Maharashtra, cub’s swabs sent for testing||The Maharashtra forest department has sent the swab samples of a three-month-old female tiger cub from Chandrapur, an orange zone, to the Nagpur Veterinary College (NVC) to conduct tests for the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19. This is the first suspected case of coronavirus in a wild animal in the state. “The test result is expected on Tuesday. We will only be able to establish if there are any traces of the virus in the cub’s body based on genetic analysis as a preliminary result. The forest department can further send samples to other institutes for definitive results, as such a Covid-19 test for animals have not been done by us before,” said Dr AP Somkuwar, associate dean, NVC, which is also testing around 50 human samples everyday.The test was done as a precautionary measure based on the suggestions by experts, said SV Ramarao, chief conservator of forest, Chandrapur. The officials had rescued the cub without wearing any protective gear and she was also unwell initially.“The cub is healthy and not showing any symptoms such as coughing, nasal discharge, respiratory distress, diarrhoea or fever etc. The swab was collected by veterinary professionals wearing personal protective equipment (PPE),” said Ramarao.“We will be closely monitoring the tiger cub’s case from Maharashtra,” Anup Nayak, member secretary, National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), said.After being abandoned by her mother on April 24, the cub was rescued from the paddy fields in Sushi Dabgaon village in Mul taluka, around 60km from Chandrapur city and 35km from the main Chandrapur-Mul road, by wildlife activists and the forest department after villagers reached out to them. The cub is currently being kept at the transit treatment centre in Chandrapur. “Villagers crowded the area making the rescue very difficult. We found the animal in the dry grass. The cub was in shock and was not keeping well the first few days,” said AL Sonkusare, divisional forest officer (territorial), Chandrapur. “However, she is much better now. None of the rescue staff or field officers has displayed any Covid-19 symptoms.”After the first confirmed case of coronavirus in a tiger at a New York zoo was reported on April 5, the NTCA had issued an advisory to all chief wildlife wardens and field directors of tiger reserves on April 6.“We expressly advised the use of PPE and all other safety measures during any rescue or rehabilitation operations involving tigers. States were also asked to send the swab samples of tigers only to three animal institutes approved by the Centre for Covid-19 testing. These include the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal; the National Research Centre on Equines (NRCE) in Hisar, Haryana, and the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh),” said Nayak.Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) said, “Based on the response from NVC, we will be sending samples again to one of the approved testing institutes identified by the Centre to ensure results are accurate.”A number of non-governmental bodies had raised concerns over the rescue operation and said it was carried out without proper PPE gear. Wildlife activist Umeshsingh Zire, who carried out the rescue operation with the forest department, said, “Neither us nor forest officials have any personal protective equipment for such rescues.”Nayak added that this was the second case of a tiger being tested for Covid-19 in India. In April, the samples of a dead 10-year-old male tiger from Pench Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh had been sent for testing.“The tiger had tested negative. So far, no tigers in the wild or forest staff has tested positive anywhere in India,” he said.Meanwhile, once the test results are received for the cub, the department plans on reuniting her with her mother. “The tigress is less than 2km away from the spot where the cub was rescued, and it is pertinent that at this young age that the cub gets the mother’s milk and protection,” said Sonkusare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/in-first-suspected-case-of-covid-19-among-wild-animals-in-state-cub-s-swabs-sent-for-testing/story-VDNNFpj35YAe9ouB27gpIM.html

One should avoid playing online chess till late night. The big problem is, players are getting addicted and playing one tournament after the other is not helping the cause,” he added.The PDCA has avoided conducting online chess tournaments during the lockdown period.“Online tournaments can never replace offline tournaments and one must remember participation in online tournaments should be limited. Many people are opting to play bullet and blitz format chess tournaments which will not help them to improve their game and one should only play classical format chess tournaments,” D’souza said.According to D’souza, 4 chess ranking tournaments in May and June have been cancelled in the city that were crucial for the age group of under-12, 14 and 16.The indoor advantageThe advantage chess has over other sports is, athletes are not missing ground practice since it is an indoor game.“Lockdown will not impact the form of any of our players as they are not missing on the practice as most players are taking coaching lessons through various video portals. I conduct daily 3 to 4 online batches, many overseas students also take part in online coaching. This is our biggest advantage over other sports.,” D’souza said.For beginners, online chess training is not beneficial and new players must learn the basics of chess training first, believes D’souza.Financial impactWith most chess academies across the city shut, the coaches and arbiters are having a tough time managing their finances.“The summer season is always important for any sport. Most of the coaches are dependent on summer camps to earn a good amount of money while arbiters depend on the tournament to make money but now everyone will be having a tough year to manage their expenses,” D’souza said.Use chessboards, not computersThe PDCA has advised all players to play chess on boards instead of playing online.“Players should only take coaching lessons online and play the game on a physical chessboard,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/don-t-play-chess-online-use-physical-chessboards-pdca-tells-players/story-PP1cjBZvgH07bGUPFA3XhP.html

However, Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol opposed the relaxation, stating that this will cause a spike in city’s Covid-19 positive case tally.The mayor also spoke to Pune’s guardian minister and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar suggesting that the curbs continue and the time window to keep shops providing non-essential items open, be reconsidered. Pawar, according to Mohol, has assured he will “consider the request positively”.Mohol said, “Pune residents followed the first two lockdown phases sincerely, however, once the lockdown was eased people came out of their homes in large numbers as if there is no threat from the virus, thus violating the social distancing norms.”According to Mohol, the district administrations order has created more confusion among residents. Mohol said that he requested Pawar to keep the time window for shops from 10 am to 2 pm instead of 10 am to 7 pm.“The way people rushed to wine shops on Monday was completely wrong.Who will responsibility if the cases increase? Daily, there are at least 100 positive cases in the city.Mohol said if the shops are open for longer people will be out of their homes for long hours. “Let the number of positive cases in the city come down and then we can relax the restrictions.

But people here were wise enough and maintained their distance from the Nanded returnees,” the SHO said.A 55-year-old Nanded returnee, residing in one the villages, said that the government had made mistake by not testing them on the day of their arrival. “On April 26 when we arrived, they sent us home without taking our samples and the next day, they picked us up from our homes and lodged us in the hospital. This was a lapse on part of the government,” he said.He further added that their neighbours are now vilifying them and accusing them of spreading the virus even though it is not their fault.The 22-year-old son of another Nanded returnee from Ghular village near Samrala said that their presence of mind saved them. “On returning, my father locked himself in a room so as to distance himself from the family. The next day, the police and heath department officials picked him up from home and took him to hospital, where he tested positive for Covid-19.” he said, adding that had his father not taken extra precautions, the entire family would have been infected.

He said that till date, the Centre had allocated only ₹71 crore to the state for fighting the disease, which was quite less.‘WOULD INCREASE TESTING CAPACITY TO 6,000 A DAYThe state health minister further said that they are working to increase the capacity of the existing government labs and assured that soon, the testing capacity in the state would be increased to 6,000 a day. He also said that testing at Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) would start soon and the government is also tying up with private labs such as Dr Lal Path Labs, Tuli Labs Amritsar and other such companies. ‘CENTRE NO PROVIDING US SUPPORT’The state health minister also hit out at the Union government, stating that Punjab was not getting any support from the Centre.He said that till date, the Union government has allocated only Rs 71 crore to Punjab to fight the virus which is very less. “The Union government has even failed to allocate pending GST arrears of Rs 4400 crore to Punjab,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maha-govt-erred-in-screening-nanded-pilgrims-punjab-health-minister/story-n5YUyZrQTVA30Ung3bpqOM.html
05-05-2020||Pune||Travel requests flood collectorate, Pune police as expectant mothers seek family support||With the government bringing in certain relaxations on movement during lockdown 3.0 in non- containment zones and allowing stranded migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists and students to travel with certain conditions, many pregnant women in Pune are also seeking permission to move to their hometowns or to their parents. The Twitter handle as well as phone lines of the collectorate and the police commisioner’s office have been flooded with requests from expectant mothers who are seeking permission to travel. While many of them want to travel within the city, others wished to travel to as far as Jharkhand or Amravati for their deliveries. Police commissioner K Venkatesham said, “We are flooded with requests for permissions from expectant mothers to travel and we are allowing them to travel within reasonable distance, but not all.”Collector Naval Kishore Ram said, “We are scrutinising each and every individual request from pregnant women and only allowing those which are feasible to travel.” Sony Kumari, who is seven-months pregnant and stuck in Pune, had been writing to the police for the past four days to seek permission to travel to her home in Jharkhand. “I am still awaiting my permission,” she said.Anumeha Singh Mahajan will welcome her first child in June this year and was elated when she got her permissions even though she had to wait a long time for it. “My husband is stuck in Bangkok since March end, and I was alone at my husband’s residence in Rahatne. I am nine-months pregnant and I had to travel to my parents two weeks ago, so I took permission from the police for both check-ups as well as for travelling to my parents’ home. Finally, I got permission to shift to my parents’ residence in Hadapsar. I also had to change my hospital for the delivery.”Neha Patil, who is expecting her first child in June, is looking forward to visit her parents in Nashik for the delivery. “There is a lot of excitement in my house, with this being their first grandchild. I was registered for delivery in Nashik, but I was prepared to deliver my child in Pune too, if the permission did not come through. I live with my husband in Chinchwad. It is my first child and I wanted to stay with my parents as there are so many emotions that we go through. In Pune, no one is there to take care of me, and I had applied for intercity travel permission to Nashik. The police responded to my phone call and to my tweets. My husband and I will be travelling by our car. It took time to get permissions, but I was prepared to deliver in Pune, in case, I didn’t get the permission.”‘Online counselling, consultation available for expectant mothers’Dr Sanjay Gupte, past president of Fogsi (federation of obstetrics and gynaecologist societies of India) and ethics committee chairperson of the federation international of gynaecologists and obstetrics (Figo) said that it is quite natural for first-time expectant mothers to feel the need of their parents with them. “There is extreme anxiety among new parents to be, as it is a big task and they are taking a lot of care, but they need the assurance of their elders. I have got calls from at least 25 young couples, who feel that either of their parents should be with them during the delivery and want permissions from the police to allow so,” said Dr Gupte. He suggests getting parents to Pune instead of the expectant mothers travelling. “One of my patients, needed her mother and we requested the police. The police officials ensured her mother came from Latur to Pune in time for the delivery, which went off smoothly,” he added.Most of the young couples are from IT sector and are away from their relatives, hence many are worried about the pregnancy and delivery. “Thus, to ease their minds, we have offered extra days’ stay for the parents till the new mother is confident of handling the baby and feeding, because without the guidance of her mother or relative, young mothers will have to learn everything on their own,” said Dr Gupte. Gupte also offers them online consultation and counselling during their visits in the 30th week. At around 7 months pregnant, the young couple is taught about managing the baby and post delivery precautions. Gupte also employs a breastfeeding consultant, and physiotherapist on call. “We make sure that only pregnant women enter the hospital premises while husbands wait outside. Everyone is screened outside the gate, and sanitised,” added Gupte.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/travel-requests-flood-collectorate-pune-police-as-expectant-mothers-seek-family-support-for-deliveries/story-9NwJVhwAIm2AvzLHJzRb7K.html

While both the cities are under the red zone, the government notification said standalone liquor shops and those selling non-essential items would be allowed. Long queues outside liquor shops were seen in areas such as Deccan Gymkhana, Aundh, Bhandarkar road, Wanawdi, Salunke Vihar, NIBM road and Nigdi with residents thronging the shops to buy alcohol. Liquor shops have been shut since the lockdown began more than a month ago in the last week of March.Excise superintendent Santosh Zagade said the government had permitted shops to open. “Even on normal days and Sundays, the liquor shops are crowded. It was natural that there were long queues outside liquor shops as they had opened after a very long time ,” he said.Long queues were seen at two of the four wine shops in Aundh near Bremen chowk and Parihar chowk. The police were called in just after the shutters opened and within half an hour one shop closed it shutters while the other was managing the crowds. At one of the shops, the owner had put up a bamboo barrier for queuing up buyers, and had put four bouncers on duty to maintain social distancing. “I set up the barriers in the morning to maintain social distancing. Everyone has been patient and co-operative and there has been no fuss or pushing to get in front. People are buying enough to last for two to three days,” said Raju Bagiya, the shop owner at Aundh.At Deccan Gymkhana, a wine shop had to close shutters when the crowds became unmanageable. Mahendra Ghule, the shop owner said, “We had to shut down as the crowds did not observe social distancing.”Amol Ghule, who has a shop at Bavdhan decided to shut his shop 4 pm, when he saw the crowd growing big. “We got the orders at 2 pm to open our shop, but by the time we could reach the shop, there was already a big queue. We had to take a decision to shut down to avoid any problems,” he said.In Salunke Vihar, around 300 persons, including women, were seen outside a prominent liquor shop since early morning .However at around 10.30 am, they were dispersed by a group of stick-wielding volunteers who said that social distancing had been completely ignored by the throng of eager shoppers.Madhumita Khanna, who had queued since morning said police presence should have been ensured at the liquor shops to ensure that social distancing was maintained.Wine shops at Nigdi chowk opened in the afternoon at around 3 pm and there too, people were waiting in long queues. “It does not matter how long I have to wait as I am getting to buy drinks after a long time. The government has taken a good decision as people will at least sit at home now,” said Yogesh Bhagat, a resident of Nigdi. There was not much of rush at liquor shops in the Katraj area. Liquor shops and other shops were also closed on Aundh-Khadki road although medical shops were open.

Officials added that it is likely that the airport will restart its functioning only from terminal 3 (T3), while terminal 2 (T2) and 1D will continue to remain closed.Domestic flights have been suspended in India from March 25 onwards, the day when a nationwide lockdownwas put in place by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to contain the spread of Covid-19. Three days prior to this, on March 22, international flight operations to and from India were also suspended.However, with flight operations expected to resume soon, the airport operator — Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) — on Sunday released its plan on how social distancing norms will be applied to ensure safe travel for all passengers. As per the new plan, while passengers of Vistara and IndiGo will use entry gates 1 and 2 to enter the terminal, Air Asia and Air India passengers will enter from gate number 3 and 4. SpiceJet, GoAir and all other passengers travelling domestic will use gate number 5 to enter the terminal. For International passengers, gate numbers 6, 7 and 8 have been alloted, the plan said.Similarly, passengers will also have dedicated check-in rows depending upon their airlines. Passengers of Vistara will use check-in row A, IndiGo passengers will use B and C rows, Air Asia passengers will use D row and those flying with Air India will use E and F check-in rows. SpiceJet passengers will use row G and those travelling with GoAir or any other domestic airline will use check-in row H. For those travelling internationally, the check-in rows will be J, K, L and M, the plan said.“From the current ‘all gates all airlines’ system we will move to the system where gates will be allocated depending upon the airlines. This has been done to distribute passenger evenly in the forecourt area outside the terminal and avoid crowding. Check in rows have also been assigned airline wise to ensure aligned passenger movement with social distancing even as they enter the terminal,” said an official, who wished not to be named.Apart from this, the plan mentioned that the DIAL has put in place queue managers with social distance markings. To avoid crowding in the security hold area, just before the security checks, seating arrangements with social distancing norms have been put in place.Even arrangements for trolley and tray disinfection have been made. Self dispensing sanitizers have been installed for passenger to use after their security and immigration checks.According to the plan, the airport operator will also keep all food, beverage and retail shops open to avoid overcrowding at one place and will also encourage contact less digital payments. It also said that ultraviolet disinfection tunnels to scan all incoming baggage has been set up and that similar rules will be followed for departure baggage handling as well.Social distance marking have also been placed around baggage belts for waiting passengers and additional seating arrangements have also been made for passengers in waiting areas, the plan sai||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/specific-entry-gates-dedicated-check-in-rows-delhi-airport-gears-up-to-restart-operations/story-mkX92EISLza6625REL3sJK.html

However, the police allegedly opened fire in the air to control the mob. After this, labourers fled and disappeared in streets.A PCR motorcyclist suffered minor injuries and some police and private vehicles were also vandalised in the melee.Assistant commissioner of police (south) Jashandeep Singh said labourers gathered on the Ludhiana-Delhi highway and complained of not getting ration or cooked food. They said they also wanted to go back to their native places, he said.The ACP added after the police personnel were pelted with stones and some vehicles were damaged by the protesters, the police used mild force to disperse them. The ACP denied allegations of opening fire in the air.He added the police have also apprehended some of the protesters and an FIR would be registered against them.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said, “According to preliminary investigation, some people had instigated labourers for the protest and to create violence. The police are trying to identify these elements.”He added the police have been conducting a flag march in the area and senior police officers and the SDM were holding meetings with the labourers to resolve their issues and to make them aware the seriousness of the situation due to coronavirus. The police have also increased distribution of ration in the area, he addedThe police chief said, “Police are also doing videography of the area using drone cameras. Anybody found trying to disrupt peace in the city will be dealt with an iron hand. The police have also told the labourers that the trains will start soon after the approval of the central government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-food-no-ration-labourers-block-road-pelt-police-with-stones-vandalise-vehicles/story-i7c65WIp24UjZmIHGhEYiJ.html
05-05-2020||World||Researchers forecast huge spike in US Covid-19 fatalities due to easing of curbs||As more American states begin rolling back restrictions with President Donald Trump cheering them along, US Covid-19 fatalities are projected to double because of the resulting “growing contact among people” to 134,475 by August, according to an update of a widely cited research model.A draft government report has separately forecast a spike in fatalities by 3,000 a day by the end of this month from around 1,500 currently, and 200,000 new infections.The cumulative US toll is projected to rise to 134,475 by August 4 according to the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation IHME), a University of Washington body whose projections are widely cited by the White House. Its forecast is twice its previous projection of 72,433 over the same period.“The revised projections reflect rising mobility in most US states as well as the easing of social distancing measures expected in 31 states by May 11, indicating that growing contacts among people will promote transmission of the coronavirus,” it said in a statement.At least 42 states have begun piecemeal reopening of their economy, businesses such as hair and nail saloons, gyms, restaurants, bowling alleys and some department stores; some have also announced plans to resume schools and allow construction and manufacturing concerns to reopen in coming days.Public health officials and experts have cautioned against rushing the reopening in violation of federal guidelines that have laid down phases separated by “gating” measures to determine if a community is ready to move from one stage to the next. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House task force on the coronavirus outbreak, has warned about “leapfrogging”.President Trump seemed unfazed by the dire predictions. He told reporters before leaving for Arizona to tour a mask-making factory, that both models were based on the assumption of no mitigation efforts. “That assumes no mitigation and we’re going to have mitigation,” he said of the IHME forecast.The IHME model had started out past March forecasting more than 82,000 Covid-19 by August, but it had significantly lowered it to around 60,000 in April it based on social-distancing measures put in force in most states. It has now scaled it up to twice its earlier projection.The projection is also double the current US toll of 68,934, up by 1,240 in the last 24 hours; infections went up to 1.18 million with 22,335 new cases over the same period.The daily toll is projected to go up significantly to 3,000 by June 1, according to the draft government report, which was first reported by New York Times and has been since disowned by the White House, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is said to have created it for the he Federal Emergency Management Agency, and researchers of the Johns Hopkins University who created the model. The number of cases are projected to jump to 200,000 a day, according to this report.Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who created the model, told Washington Post that projections were work in progress and finished data would differ. But, he warned, the number of daily infections could go to 100,000 and much would depend on political decisions being taken now. “There are reopening scenarios where it could get out of control very quickly,” Lessler was quoted as saying.President Trump has aggressively pushed for reopening the country and a return to normalcy with an eye on his re-election, even as he has had to temper his display of optimism by continuously revising upwards his own assessment of fatalities — he is now saying it can hit 100,000.The White House dismissed the report. “This is not a White House document nor has it been presented to the Coronavirus Task Force or gone through interagency vetting,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. “This data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the task force or data that the task force has analyzed. The president’s phased guidelines to open up America again are a scientific driven approach that the top health and infectious disease experts in the federal government agreed with. The health of the American people remains President Trump’s top priority and that will continue as we monitor the efforts by states to ease restrictions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/researchers-forecast-huge-spike-in-us-covid-19-fatalities-due-to-easing-of-curbs/story-gYOPgq6r9ovNODxFuH2IRN.html
05-05-2020||World||As Donald Trump resumes travel, staff takes risks to prepare trip||For much of the last two months, President Donald Trump has rarely left the grounds of the White House as he’s dealt with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic and sought to minimize his own exposure to the disease.But that changes Tuesday, when Trump is scheduled to travel to Arizona to visit a Honeywell facility that makes N95 masks in what the president suggests will mark the return to more regular travel.The trip also means a small army of advisers, logistical experts and security staff — a coterie of hundreds that includes personnel from the White House, Defense Department, Secret Service and more — will resume regularly hitting the road again and taking a measure of risk to assist Trump.Besides Tuesday’s trip to Honeywell, Trump says he will travel soon to Ohio, to New York in June for the U.S. Military Academy graduation and to South Dakota in July for a holiday fireworks display at Mount Rushmore. Trump says he’s also eager to get back on the campaign trail, though he acknowledged during a Fox News forum Sunday that he might not be able to hold his signature big-stadium rallies until the final months before the Nov. 3 election.“I’ve been at the White House now for many months, and I’d like to get out, as much as I love this. ... Most beautiful house in the world,” Trump said in announcing his travel plans.At a moment when public health officials have asked Americans to postpone nonessential travel to help stem the coronavirus, Trump is looking to rev the engines of Air Force One as he tries to prod a shell-shocked American electorate — reeling from the death and economic destruction wrought by the virus — to edge back to normal life.But White House officials are also taking precautions to try to prevent Trump and Vice President Mike Pence from exposure to the virus. Honeywell workers who meet Trump on Tuesday — just like anyone else who comes in close proximity to the president and vice president — will be first required to take a rapid point-of-care test to determine if they’re carrying the virus.“When preparing for and carrying out any travel, the White House’s operational teams work together to ensure plans to incorporate current CDC guidance and best practices for limiting COVID-19 exposure are followed to the greatest extent possible,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said.But Matt Bennett, who served as Vice President Al Gore’s trip director, said he worries that Trump is putting his staff, military personnel and local and state officials at unnecessary risk.“I think there is a value of seeing our leaders out in the country and escaping the White House,” said Bennett, executive vice president at the center-left think tank Third Way. “But it has to be balanced against the cost. The cost here could be the health and safety of a lot of people.”James McCann, a Purdue University political scientist who has studied presidential travel, said that Trump early in his term traveled significantly less frequently on official presidential business compared to his four predecessors. But now that a big campaign rally is not possible, Trump is searching for a way to assert himself.“Trump is itching to get into campaign mode,” McCann said.Marc Short, Pence’s chief of staff, told reporters the vice president, who last week traveled to Indiana and Minnesota, has been debriefing the White House Military Office after each trip to discuss planning and protocols.Typically, White House advance staff fly commercial airlines when traveling to scout a location before a presidential or vice presidential visit. But Short said staffers are now taking military aircraft. Ahead of Pence’s trip to an Indiana plant where ventilators are being manufactured, advance staffers were not allowed to leave the military base where Air Force Two landed, Short said.The Secret Service, which is tasked with protecting the president and his family, wouldn’t get into the details of how it’s altering operations but said it’s following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance.“Since the beginning of this pandemic, the Secret Service has been working with all of our public safety partners and the White House Medical Unit to ensure the safety and security of both our protected persons and our employees,” said Justine Whelan, a spokeswoman for the agency.In addition to the White House advance staff, which is tasked with plotting out the smallest details of the president’s visit, the Secret Service sends its own advance team that maps out security for the visit. Officials from the White House communications office advance team are dispatched to set security telephone access for the president should he need it.The president flies on Air Force One, military-operated aircraft, on all trips, regardless of whether it is White House business, political or personal travel. The Defense Department also airlifts equipment such as armored limousines and occasionally helicopters for the president’s travel.The Military Working Dog Program and Explosive Ordnance Disposal Program are dispatched to support protection of the president. Typically, about a dozen members of the news media travel with the president on Air Force One at their organization’s expense.The president usually travels with a representative from the press office, the chief of staff’s office and the National Security Council, as well as a personal assistant. Other aides, like his economic advisers, a Cabinet secretary or lawmakers, also may join depending on the nature of the visit.Johanna Maska, who served as the White House director of press advance during the Obama administration, said it’s important for administration officials to remember that everyone who travels or assists in the president’s travel — from the closest aides to the volunteer van drivers who drive lower-rung aides from the airport — have families.“There is a whole orbit around those people,” Maska said. “I certainly hope that they are making the right decisions here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-donald-trump-resumes-travel-staff-takes-risks-to-prepare-trip/story-HUf4fKzM8y5JrUZE25GJTK.html

Malls were popular and crowded destinations before the pandemic. They are also drivers of revenue for big Thai conglomerates such as Central Group and TCC Group.Officials reported one additional coronavirus case and no new deaths Tuesday, in a further sign that Thailand’s outbreak is ebbing. The number of detected infections stands at 2,988.

In March, Israeli daily Ha’aretz, quoting medical sources, had reported that scientists at the institute had made a significant breakthrough in understanding the biological mechanism and qualities of the virus, including better diagnostic capability, production of antibodies for those who already have the virus and development of a vaccine. It was not immediately clear if the breakthrough presented to Bennett was in addition to progress that was reported in late March, and no further details were provided. The statement also did not specify whether human trials were conducted.Apparently, the IIBR conducted some clinical trials, PTI has learnt.The researchers have identified the protein that is efficient in killing the virus in patient’s body, and the institute would be publishing a paper soon about the findings.The IIBR was established in 1952 as part of the Israel Defence Forces’ Science Corps, and later became a civilian organization. It is technically under the supervision of the Prime Minister’s Office, but is in close communication with the Defence Ministry. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is said to have ordered the institute to devote resources to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 on February 1.The Defence Ministry in March had denied any breakthrough simply stating that “if and when there will be something to report, it will be done in an orderly fashion”, the Defence Ministry told Ha’aretz at the time.“The biological institute is a world-renowned research and development agency, which relies on experienced researchers and scientists with great knowledge and quality infrastructures. There are now more than 50 experienced scientists working at the institute on researching and developing a medical remedy for the virus”, it had said.The normal process of development of such a vaccine requires a long process of pre-clinical trials on animals, followed by clinical trials. This period allows for a full characterization of side effects and a better understanding of how different populations are affected.Five shipments of virus samples arrived in Israel from Japan, Italy and other countries, news portal Ynet reported in February. They were brought by a specially secured Defence Ministry courier to IIBR and had been frozen at -80 degrees Celsius. There has been intensive work, including by leading experts, to develop the vaccine since then. Experts believe that the length of time needed to develop a vaccine runs from a few months to a year and a half. Numerous research teams all over the world are participating in the race to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. Many of them at this point are focusing on the way the virus presents itself in animals, with the biggest hurdle being the way it morphs when it moves from animals to human beings. China released the genetic sequence of the virus on open scientific databases shortly after its outbreak in January so that research institutes and commercial companies could try to develop treatments and vaccines without requiring to obtain samples. Many private companies have also made claims of having successfully developed treatment against COVID-19, but there isn’t a proven track record on display yet. The novel coronavirus, which first emerged in China in late December, has so far killed over 2.5 lakh people and infected more than 3.6 million globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/significant-breakthrough-in-developing-antibody-against-covid-19-israel-s-defence-minister/story-3KI9V7tiqPhMbpXrqsROgK.html

Italy’s death toll is reported to be 29,029.The realistic UK-wide figure is over 30,000, since the ONS figure does not include deaths in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner said the new figures made Johnson’s recent claim of having ‘past the peak’ meaningless.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageHowever, Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, warned against international comparisons. She told MPs: “It is extremely difficult to compare between countries at the moment. We need to not just look at the numbers clearly, but at the rates”.“The obvious one is age and standardised death rates per million population. Those are not the numbers that are routinely reported, so it is really difficult to do direct comparisons.”The Johnson government faced continuing criticism on lack of testing in initial stages. Harries admitted there was ‘lack of capacity’ to test, adding: “If we had unlimited capacity we would have done (it) differently”.The government on Tuesday published a cache of documents from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), whose recommendations have been driving lockdown and other measures. The group comprises mainly experts from various disciplines.The Johnson government was widely criticised in the initial stages for adopting a ‘herd immunity’ approach, but quickly abandoned it when expert modelling suggested it could lead to over 5 lakh deaths. It has since denied ‘herd immunity’ was ever government policy.A new app to track and trace was introduced in the Isle of Wight on Tuesday, before its UK-wide rollout. Johnson is to announce steps to ease the lockdown on Sunday, but House of Commons speaker Lindsay Hoyle said such major announcements should be made in parliament first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-over-30-000-covid-19-deaths-uk-now-worst-hit-in-europe/story-nOAkUZWs2dhPVitMYJR5zL.html

The antibody or passive vaccine attacks the virus and neutralises it in the body.“The Jewish creativity and ingenuity brought about this amazing achievement,” he further said in the statement.Bennett’s statement was released after he visited the labs of the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR), a secretive unit that works under the Prime Minister’s Office. The scientists there told him that the development phase of the vaccine has been complete.IIBR Director Shmuel Shapira said that the antibody formula was being patented, after which an international manufacturer would be sought to mass-produce it.The IIBR has been leading Israeli efforts to develop a treatment and vaccine for the coronavirus, including the testing of blood from those who recovered from Covid-19.Antibodies in such samples - immune-system proteins that are residues of successfully overcoming the coronavirus - are widely seen as a key to developing a possible cure. A second Israeli research team, MigVax, has also reported that it is close to completing the first phase of development of a coronavirus vaccine. Last week, it secured a US $12 million investment to accelerate the path to clinical trials.Israel was one of the first countries to close its borders and impose increasingly stringent restrictions on movement to hamper the domestic coronavirus outbreak. It has reported 16,246 cases and 235 deaths from the illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-treatment-israel-s-secret-lab-isolates-coronavirus-antibody-minister-calls-it-significant-breakthrough/story-sqm0IzCBYNSTGnGW10xP3L.html

05-05-2020||World||75 years after WWII, search continues for missing soldiers||Thomas Siepert looks across the verdant grain field, glowing in the sun after a spring thunderstorm, as windmills slowly churn in the distance.Wild boar piglets trundle across the road into town and a hare pops out and dashes away. Yet the serene scene belies the slaughter there 75 years ago as German troops fought furiously — and futilely — to stave off the Soviet Red Army that was approaching the Nazi capital.“It seems so idyllic, but it’s a huge cemetery,” Siepert said. “That shouldn’t be forgotten.”But for decades, many of those who died there were forgotten, some buried where they fell and others dragged by civilians in the months after the war into trenches and foxholes they had themselves dug, and covered over.For the last 15 years, volunteers like Siepert from around Europe have been trying to rectify that, devoting vacations to excavating long-buried trench lines and military positions in the search for those who never made it home.During 19 digs across a square kilometer (less than half a square mile), members of the Association for the Recovery of the Fallen in Eastern Europe have found 116 German and 129 Soviet soldiers.They seek to identify as many as possible — to provide closure for families, to give the dead their names back, and to separate them from the numbers in the history books in the hope of explaining the cost of war to future generations.“On all sides, these are destroyed lives. These are all people who died senselessly,” said Albrecht Laue, chairman of the association. “If we talk about a huge slaughter with hundreds of thousands of dead, nobody can understand that. But if I talk about the story of a young 17-year-old soldier, that’s tangible.”Laue, a 46-year-old businessman from Hamburg, got interested in the search when looking for the grave of his grandfather, which he located near where he died fighting in Russia in 1942 as a young lieutenant. Siepert, 47, an engineer from nearby Frankfurt an der Oder, remembers as a child having regular lectures in school about avoiding the grenades and other munitions still found in the area, and wondering why.Other volunteers include anthropologists, archaeologists, excavators and the disposal experts needed when munitions are found. They hail from all over, including Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands.“We couldn’t, and also don’t, want to look for soldiers from a specific nation,” Laue said. “That’s the interesting thing when one finds one of the dead; one never even knows at the beginning if it’s a German or a Soviet.”In February 1945, they were bitter foes.The village of Klessin sits on a height 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from the Oder River. German military observers used it to call in artillery strikes on Soviet troops as they streamed across a pontoon bridge in the build-up before the final push on Berlin.Recognizing the strategic importance of the hamlet, 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Berlin, the Soviets made it a target. The Nazis resolved to hold it, moving in a unit of soldiers, augmented by officer cadets and older “Volkssturm” militia, scraped up as the number of military-aged men dwindled.The fighting pitted 400 Germans in Klessin against about four times that number of Soviets, with the Germans supported by a unit of Panther tanks in the neighboring village of Podelzig, nearby artillery and air-dropped supplies.Fierce combat raged for nearly two months, often hand-to-hand, as the Soviets attempted to take the village, firing off 62,000 mortar rounds and artillery shells.Exactly how many were killed or listed as missing is not known, but the casualties were enormous, Siepert said.“On March 20, German troops tried to break through there to make a corridor,” he said, pointing to a field between Klessin and Podelzig where the Soviets had laid a minefield and other defenses after encircling the village. “There were 150 missing from that single attack, as well as 50 killed. Seventy made it through.”On March 23, 1945, the beleaguered German soldiers attempted a breakout under the cover of darkness. About 60 made it, and the others were captured or killed.German tank commander Lt. Hans Eimer was listed as missing after the breakout attempt. Eimer had led his Panther tank into Klessin the week before on his 22nd birthday to support the garrison, but the vehicle ended up being knocked out and he was wounded and trapped in the village.Eimer’s younger brother, Fritz, had died in fighting that January. After the war, his sister Margarete had long urged Laue’s group to try and determine the fate of her only other sibling.Eimer’s remains were located by Laue’s group in 2016 by chance and identified by dogtags. The group told Margarete before she died in 2018 that her brother had made it 250 meters (yards) out of the village before he was killed, and lay with two other soldiers.Identifications are rare, especially of the Soviet soldiers who had no dogtags, but occasionally the volunteers get lucky.In a dig on a Soviet outpost on a hill outside of Klessin in 2018, they came across three Soviet soldiers who were all highly decorated and traced their names through the medals.This year’s spring dig has been postponed due to lockdown restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic. Some work is still underway on a memorial site being established amid the rubble of the original farm buildings.Hermann Kaiser, a member of the small community association behind the memorial, said he remembered finding military material as a kid growing up in the area, happily throwing on an old steel helmet and fighting “war” with his friends, while not understanding they were playing on graves.The hope is with the memorial to make sure that others do understand.“We want to present what happened here 75 years ago, what war means, show the younger generation that war destroys everything,” he said, looking at the cratered landscape and rubble of the memorial. “And if we can do that in the place where it happened, it’s unforgettable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/75-years-after-wwii-search-continues-for-missing-soldiers/story-B6qq9AjbvvoCMG9kIAPbbM.html

Kim, who was rumored earlier this month to have fallen ill, didn’t attend the ceremony.Photos of the meeting in Pyongyang showed Russian and North Korean officials wearing face masks despite the fact that North Korea so far has not reported a single case of the new coronavirus.Last year Russia invited Kim to visit Moscow on May 9 and attend the military parade marking the 75th anniversary of the victory. Putin announced the decision to postpone the parade indefinitely last month because of the coronavirus pandemic.In 2015, the North Korean leader rejected a similar invitation to the 70th anniversary, citing domestic affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vladimir-putin-awards-commemorative-wwii-medal-to-kim-jong-un/story-tWp0To5RgGHn3QDFpuCACO.html
05-05-2020||World||US will witness 3,000 coronavirus deaths daily by June 1: Report||The number of coronavirus deaths in the US will jump to over 3,000 and new cases to about 200,000 per day by June 1, an internal draft report has said, even as more than two dozen American states announced to open up their economy amid the health crisis.The US is the worst-hit country from the pandemic. By Monday, more than 1.2 million Americans tested positive for the Covid-19 and the total number of fatalities increased to more than 69,000.The country’s economy has come to a standstill and over 30 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits.Multiple media reports on Monday quoted the draft report projecting the horrifying figures of about 200,000 confirmed cases per day accompanied with 3,000 daily deaths by June 1.“The numbers underscore a sobering reality: while the United States has been hunkered down for the past seven weeks, not much has changed. And the reopening to the economy will make matters worse,” The New York Times reported.“There remains a large number of counties whose burden continues to grow,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned according to the daily.However, both the White House and the CDC disavowed the report. The slides carry the CDC’s logo, The Washington Post reported.According to the report, the projection was prepared by Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.“I had no role in the process by which that was presented and shown. This data was presented as an FYI to CDC … it was not in any way intended to be a forecast,” Lessler told The Washington Post.Lessler said he didn’t know how the update was turned into a slide deck by government officials and shared with the news organisations.“There are reopening scenarios where it could get out of control very quickly,” he said.Judd Deere, a White House Spokesperson said, “This is not a White House document nor has it been presented to the Coronavirus Task Force or gone through interagency vetting.” This data is not reflective of any of the modelling done by the task force or data that the task force has analyzed, he said.“The President’s phased guidelines to open up America again are a scientific driven approach that the top health and infectious disease experts in the federal government agreed with. The health of the American people remains President Trump’s top priority and that will continue as we monitor the efforts by states to ease restrictions,” Deere said.Meanwhile, more than a dozen US states eased COVID-19 restrictions and another over a dozen have announced their plans to do so in the coming days.States like Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas and Illinois, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina, Vermont, and West Virginia have lifted restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-000-coronavirus-deaths-daily-by-june-1-in-us-report/story-6hCSqve3fAvZVv1aurKJvJ.html
05-05-2020||World||Coronavirus deaths top 250,000 as billions pledged for vaccine push||The global death toll from the coronavirus pandemic topped a quarter of a million on Tuesday, with the US government predicting a further surge in fatalities as an international vaccine drive garnered $8 billion in pledges.The dire forecast from the United States came as much of the Western world emerged from weeks of lockdown, with hopes that the disease may have peaked in Europe after nearly two months of confinement.But the global progress did little to cool a war of words between the US and China -- fueled by American claims the virus originated in a Chinese laboratory, a theory the World Health Organization (WHO) labelled “speculative.”An AFP tally of official figures showed Europe is the hardest-hit continent with around 145,000 fatalities. The US has recorded close to 68,700. Together they account for more than 85 percent of global deaths. Since the disease first surfaced in China late last year the number of confirmed cases has reached almost 3.6 million.The grim figures were compounded Monday by an internal government estimate in Washington that forecast the daily COVID-19 infection rate in the US could surge eight-fold to 200,000 per day by June 1, and the death toll could rise to 3,000.‘Evolved in nature’ A special telethon backed by the WHO but snubbed by Washington pulled in $8.1 billion to support international efforts to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus.Leaders of major European powers, Japan, and Canada made the biggest pledges, along with philanthropists including Bill and Melinda Gates.“This was a powerful and inspiring demonstration of global solidarity,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.Seeming to defend its non-participation, the US State Department insisted the United States is “leading” the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and said it has spent more than $1 billion together with US drug companies to work on a vaccine. As the country struggles to contain its outbreak, the White House has stepped up an offensive against China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying there is “enormous evidence” the virus emerged in a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan.That claim was rejected Monday by the WHO as well as top US epidemiologist and government adviser Anthony Fauci.“Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that (this virus) evolved in nature and then jumped species,” he said.US President Donald Trump has acknowledged that deaths will go beyond his earlier prediction of 60,000, saying: “We’re going to lose anywhere from 75, 80 to 100,000 people.”His estimate underscored the tough, politically-tinged debate over reopening, which pits concerns about a rising death toll against the need to restore national economies shattered by prolonged shutdowns.On Monday US manufacturing giant General Electric announced it will cut an additional 10,000 jobs from its aviation sector as the pandemic decimates the industry.The economic fallout in America prompted the US Treasury to announce it will borrow a record $3 trillion in the April-June period, largely to finance spending on virus relief programmes.In Australia officials said the economy is losing Aus$4 billion (US$2.5 billion) every week the nation’s virus shutdown continues, with GDP forecast to plunge 10 percent in the June quarter.‘We are all afraid’ People across Europe basked in a return to the outdoors, mixed with a dose of trepidation about life ahead and the economic damage wreaked by lockdowns.Workers banged away at construction sites in Rome, police handed out masks in Madrid and older children returned to school in Vienna.“We are all afraid,” said a masked Cristina Jimenez, 31, in Madrid.“Who hasn’t lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,” she added.“But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.”Spain and Portugal made face masks mandatory on public transport as they further eased their lockdowns, while Slovenia, Poland and Hungary allowed public spaces and businesses to partially reopen.Africa’s biggest city, Lagos, got back to work at the end of a five-week virus shutdown, while in India police waded in to separate people jostling to buy alcohol for the first time in 40 days as the world’s biggest lockdown eased.New Delhi said it had also embarked on a “massive” operation involving naval ships and aircraft to bring back some of the hundreds of thousands of Indian nationals stuck in the Maldives and United Arab Emirates due to coronavirus restrictions.Hong Kong meanwhile announced plans to ease major social distancing measures, including by reopening schools, cinemas, bars and beauty parlours after the Chinese territory largely halted local transmission of the virus.And in a ray of hope for the sports world, South Korea’s baseball players returned to action Tuesday in a new season, albeit to empty stadiums.Friday will also see the delayed start of the country’s football K-League, and next week some of golf’s leading women players will tee up in a domestic tournament as South Korea becomes a rare hotspot for live sport. ‘There’s still beauty’ Culture of a different kind was providing a balm for people in Washington, where French harmonica player Frédéric Yonnet is putting on regular two-hour concerts for free for people gathering outside his home in the US capital.Wanda Evans, basking in the music from her car, said: “There’s still art, there’s still talent, there’s still beauty to be shared in this world.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-deaths-top-250-000-as-billions-pledged-for-vaccine-push/story-Fazjh7xjiVfYbnLfKSYrHN.html
05-05-2020||World||Masked and standing apart, the world tiptoes out of Covid-19 lockdown||Italy and the United States were among a slew of countries tentatively easing coronavirus lockdowns on Monday to revive economies as global deaths surpassed a quarter of a million.World leaders and organisations pledged $8 billion to fund a possible vaccine and treatments, many hoping explicitly to ensure that no country on Earth would be left out, but the United States did not contribute.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageItaly, among the world’s hardest-hit countries, allowed about 4.5 million people to return to work after nearly two months at home. Construction work can resume and relatives can reunite.“I woke up at 5:30 a.m., I was so excited,” said Maria Antonietta Galluzzo, a grandmother taking her three-year-old grandson for a walk in Rome’s Villa Borghese park, the first time they had seen each other in eight weeks.In the United States, which has the world’s highest total of infections and deaths, at almost 1.2 million and 68,000 respectively, Ohio and other states were easing more curbs on businesses. An internal US government document projected a sharp rise in daily deaths by June 1, the New York Times reported on Monday, to 3,000 Americans a day by the end of May, up from a current daily toll that a Reuters tally places at around 2,000. On the same day, a University of Washington research model often cited by White House officials nearly doubled its projected US death toll to over 134,000 by Aug. 4.Asked about the Times report, White House spokesman Judd Deere said: “This is not a White House document nor has it been presented to the Coronavirus Task Force or gone through interagency vetting.”In New York, the hardest-hit US state, Governor Andrew Cuomo outlined a phased reopening of business, starting with industries such as construction, and the least affected regions.Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Finland, Nigeria, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Israel and Lebanon were also among countries variously reopening factories, construction sites, parks, hairdressers and libraries. The daily increase in coronavirus cases worldwide has been 2%-3% over the past week, down from around 13% in mid-March.Confirmed cases - certain to exclude many mild cases - have risen to around 3.58 million, according to a Reuters tally.Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said his country, where the novel coronavirus has killed over 29,000 people and over a thousand new cases are reported daily, was still in the “full throes of the pandemic.”A CHANGED WORLDItaly’s statistics bureau said it could be assumed that a further 11,600 deaths were people who had died of Covid-19 without being tested, or of other causes that a stressed health service had been unable to treat them for.Friends are still barred from meeting up, most shops must stay shut until May 18, and schools, cinemas and theatres remain closed indefinitely.“It is good to be back, but the world has totally changed,” said Gianluca Martucci, pulling up the shutters on the small warehouse of a catering business in the backstreets of Rome. “I worry that we might be starting up a little too soon ... I don’t know if the country could survive a second wave.”Hairdressers, ironmongers and other shops tentatively opened as Spain, too, began a phased reopening. Red Cross workers handed out masks at Madrid metro stations, now mandatory on public transport.And Spain’s widely watched top tier of soccer, La Liga, said clubs were starting to train in the hope of resuming the season in June.Similar phased steps were taken in other countries, from Portugal and Belgium to India and Israel.But Japan extended a state of emergency to at least May 31.And the EU agency for disease control said Britain, yet to ease its lockdown, was one of five European countries yet to reach the peak of its outbreak, contradicting the UK government’s line.People around the world are adjusting to a new normality.In Washington, the US Supreme Court smoothly conducted arguments by teleconference for the first time and broadcast them live online.In Rome, a hum of cars, buses and motorbikes pointed to an increase in morning commuting, but traffic was relatively light and people appeared to be keeping their distance.In Beirut, restaurants began to reopen but were removing chairs and tables to remain less than 30% full.Iran, which has reported more than 6,000 deaths, was due to reopen mosques in 132 cities. ‘UNPRECEDENTED COOPERATION’After a fractious and haphazard initial global response to the pandemic, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said the $8.1 billion initially raised by the U.N.-backed donor conference would “help kick-start unprecedented global cooperation.”Access to an eventual vaccine “will be given to people across the globe by the organisation we choose,” French President Emmanuel Macron said.A senior US administration official declined to say specifically why the United States was not participating.“We support this pledging effort by the EU. It is one of many pledging efforts that are going on and the United States is at the forefront,” the official told reporters by telephone.President Donald Trump is halting US funding to the World Health Organization over its handling of the pandemic.“It is a pity the US is not a part of it,” said Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg, pledging $1 billion. “When you are in a crisis, you manage it and you do it jointly with others.”Factory activity slumped across the world in April and the outlook is bleak as shutdowns have frozen production and hammered demand. The global economy is expected to suffer its steepest contraction on record.Escalating tensions between the United States and China over the origin of the pandemic drove down stock markets and oil prices as investors feared a new trade war.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/masked-and-standing-apart-the-world-tiptoes-out-of-covid-19-lockdown/story-PBeMXZ3yUuLK0ObXS3NRhO.html
05-05-2020||World||Covid-19 fatality in these 2 small nations below 0.1% as deaths grow worldwide||As the global death toll from the coronavirus pandemic exceeds 250,000, two tiny nations stand out with the lowest fatality rates among countries who are experiencing major outbreaks.In Qatar and Singapore, the death toll is less than 0.1% of reported infections. In Singapore, where total cases have surged to one of the highest in Asia as it grapples with outbreaks in foreign-worker dormitories, a 102-year-old woman recovered from the virus and was discharged from hospital over the weekend.Patient demographics and the ability of the health-care system to cope are key to keeping the survival rate high in this pandemic, health experts say. While some countries with small outbreaks like Vietnam have not suffered a single death, those dealing with major spread -- defined as more than 10,000 cases -- often start to see their health-care infrastructure come under pressure.Among economies with major outbreaks, Qatar’s case fatality ratio is the lowest at 0.07% -- 12 deaths out of more than 16,000 cases. Singapore’s ratio is 0.093% of more than 19,000 infections. Both countries have also kept mortality from the virus low as a proportion of their populations: less than 0.5 per 100,000 people.The two nations are also among some of the wealthiest in the world, which means they can better afford the test kits and hospital beds they need. Just behind Qatar and Singapore in survival rates are Belarus, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.These rates are calculated from official numbers self-reported by nations. Belarus has come under criticism for allegedly under-reporting its data.Low case fatality ratios boil down to three things: testing, age of the population and intensive care unit capacity, said Raina MacIntyre, professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales.“Countries that test more and detect more mild cases will have an apparently lower case fatality rate,” she said. Older populations and countries that exceed their intensive care unit and ventilator capacity will also have higher death rates, she said.While Singapore has an aging population and a higher median age than Qatar, the majority of its infections are among low-wage foreign workers, who are typically young and undergo health checks before they are allowed into the country to work.Similarly, many of the cases in the Middle East are within the younger, migrant workforce. The majority of the population in U.A.E. and Qatar are younger expatriates, who also go through health checks before entering the country, and are required to leave once their employment is over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-fatality-in-these-2-small-nations-below-0-1-as-deaths-grow-worldwide/story-e9JPUxPmb9eJ1nchhcZElM.html

Its forecast is double its previous projection of 72,433 over the same period.The spike in the internal assessment was ascribed to “large number of counties whose burden continues to grow”, according the New York Times.But the IHME forecast was clear. “The revised projections reflect rising mobility in most US states as well as the easing of social distancing measures expected in 31 states by May 11, indicating that growing contacts among people will promote transmission of the coronavirus,” it said in a statement.President Trump has aggressively pushed for reopening the country and a return to normalcy with an eye on his re-election, even as he has had to temper his display of optimism by continuously revising upwards his own assessment of fatalities — he is now saying it can hit 100,000.At 68,920 on Monday, the toll was way past the American president’s earlier forecast of 60,000, and is poised to overtake not only his subsequent projections but also IHME’s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huge-spike-projected-in-us-covid-19-cases-fatalities/story-fXNm46K6kr2iwWHoSRyLdJ.html

She was acquitted last year.“USCIRF is aware of nearly 80 individuals who remained imprisoned for blasphemy, with at least half facing a life sentence or death,” it further said in the report.Highlighting the plight of Ahmadiya Muslims, the panel said in its reports, “Ahmadi Muslims, with their faith essentially criminalised, continued to face severe persecution from authorities as well as societal harassment due to their beliefs, with both the authorities and mobs targeting their houses of worship.”It also said that 1,000 women are forcibly converted to Islam each year in Pakistan. “Many are kidnapped, forcibly married, and subjected to rape.”The commission monitors religious freedoms around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-panel-want-pakistan-to-be-re-designated-for-religious-freedom-violations/story-Y8Wd4tyEsSKRj0r1QaZGNO.html

Restrictions lifted on other commercial activity in several provinces as well.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the country was on a “positive trajectory” as the easing of restrictions commenced. That view was echoed by Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Therera Tam, as she said, “In some places, the epidemic has been brought under good control and the time is right for a cautious reopening.” The country counted 60,650 cases of coronavirus infection by Monday evening, including 3,842 deaths.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe easing is taking place in retail stores in many places, with a couple of provinces even seeing some restaurants back to serving customers.However, in the province of Quebec, which accounts for over half the recorded cases in Canada, permission to reopen such establishments has been delayed by an additional week in the city of Montreal and its vicinity, as the area has been hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.Click here for Covid-19 updatesMeanwhile, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business welcomed the “careful, phased approach to the reopening of the economy.” In a statement, it said it was “good news that some businesses in some provinces will be permitted to serve customers once again.”The closure of businesses across the country has played havoc with the economy and has led to record unemployment. Given these circumstances, Trudeau said, during his daily media briefing, that there was no timeline for presenting the Federal Budget, which was scheduled for March.“A budget in normal times is a forecast of the measures that will be presented in the year to come. Right now we are in a period of uncertainty, extraordinary uncertainty, as to what might happen next month or in three months,” he said. This was to be the first Budget to be presented since he formed a minority Government following Federal elections in October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-a-positive-trajectory-says-pm-trudeau-as-canada-eases-covid-19-lockdown-restrictions/story-1aBEhkUtWFSIAzRt52MROM.html

05-05-2020||World||Global coronavirus death toll surpasses 250,000: Report||More than a quarter of a million people have died from the novel coronavirus worldwide, with over 85 percent of them in Europe and the United States, according to an AFP tally of official figures.At 2230 GMT on Monday, the US had recorded 68,689 virus deaths, the most for any single country, while Europe was the hardest-hit continent with 145,023 confirmed fatalities.Since it emerged in China in December, Covid-19 has infected more than 3.5 million people and devastated economies across the globe.The virus death toll in the US was followed by those in Italy (29,079), the United Kingdom (28,734), Spain (25,428) and France (25,201).There have been more than 1.5 million confirmed coronavirus infections in Europe, but many countries are testing only the most serious cases.The tallies, using data collected by AFP from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization (WHO), are widely considered likely to reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-coronavirus-death-toll-tops-250-000-report/story-bZDOTCXY2Syl7UHcxnUAZM.html
05-05-2020||World||Malls, movies and more: A look at reopenings by US amid Covid-19 lockdown||The reopening of the economy and loosening of coronavirus-prompted restrictions remain uneven and varied throughout the U.S. as governors watch case numbers and weigh caution against desires to ramp up business.Texas, Oklahoma, and Montana are among states newly allowing restaurants to reopen. Malls, movie theaters and other venues are reopening in several states. Some states have outlined phased reopenings: North Carolina’s governor said he hopes to start such a process after this week if virus trends allow.Some states, including epicenter New York, are moving more slowly, with restrictions in place at least until May 15. In California, some counties have announced their reopening in defiance of an ongoing stay-home order.And some states never issued stay-home orders at all.At least 100 million Americans were in states making assertive moves to reopen, or had no stay-home orders to begin with, according to an Associated Press tally. States home to more than 210 million were taking more gradual steps or didn’t appear close to reopening.Here’s a look at where states stand on reopening.NEW MOVES:TEXAS: The stay-home order expired Friday, and restaurants, malls and movie theaters can reopen at 25 percent capacity with social distancing. Counties with five or fewer reported coronavirus cases have looser occupancy rules. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has said restrictions may be relaxed further in two weeks depending on testing results. Beaches and state parks are open. Bars, gyms and hair salons remain closed.SOUTH CAROLINA: The stay-home order lifted Monday as South Carolina let outdoor restaurant dining resume. Parks, beaches, malls, hotels and clothing stores have reopened. Republican Gov. Henry McMaster said up next are hair salons, gyms and other close-contact businesses.FLORIDA: Restaurants and shops could reopen at limited capacity Monday across Florida, except for three hard-hit counties. State parks reopened with social distancing rules. Gyms and salons remain closed. Schools will stay closed for the rest of this school year.TENNESSEE: After allowing many restaurants and retail stores to reopen last week, salons and other close-contact stores will be allowed to resume Wednesday. The state has released guidelines on safely reopening, but officials acknowledge Tennessee won’t enforce such measures.OKLAHOMA: Restaurant dining rooms, bars serving food, gyms and churches began welcoming back customers last week under social distancing and sanitation guidelines, following the earlier reopening of barbers and hair and nail salons. Employees, including church staff, are required to wear masks.

Distancing and mask requirements were in place for employees and some customers in urban Salt Lake County. Schools are closed for the academic year. Republican Gov. Gary Herbert said churches will likely be among the last places to reopen.COLORADO: Offices deemed nonessential were allowed to reopen Monday with reduced staff.

In subsequent weeks, offices, hotels, casinos, restaurants and other remaining businesses could reopen.ALASKA: Starting April 24, officials in Alaska allowed dine-in service at restaurants and reopening of retailers, personal care services and other businesses, with limitations. For example, the plans call for use of face coverings, limits on capacity and sanitizing requirements. The state in April decided there would be no in-person classes for K-12 students for the rest of the academic year.VERMONT: More Vermont construction and manufacturing workers returned to work Monday after Republican Gov. Phil Scott loosened some restrictions. Scott also announced Monday that some elective health care procedures may resume.

Gina Raimondo has consistently said she hopes to lift the state’s stay-at-home order May 8 to begin a phased restart of the economy. The first phase includes opening some state parks or beaches, allowing hospitals to perform elective procedures and other easing of restrictions, all with social distancing.MISSISSIPPI: Republican Gov. Tate Reeves is easing restrictions on restaurants and outdoor gatherings, both beginning Thursday.

Ned Lamont plans a multiphased reopening, starting May 20. That’s when outdoor restaurant dining, in addition to existing takeout, will be allowed. Barring virus flare-ups by then, Lamont also hopes to reopen -- with added precautions -- salons, outdoor zoo and museum exhibits, camping and other outdoor recreation, and university research programs.NEW YORK: The statewide shutdown order expires May 15. After that, while New York City is the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, Democratic Gov.

Some upstate hospitals have been allowed to resume elective surgeries but must maintain a certain threshold of open beds for emergencies. Schools are closed through the academic year.NEW JERSEY: The COVID-19 hotspot has had nearly 8,000 deaths and over 128,000 positive cases. It is not fully reopening yet, though Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy reopened parks and golf courses last week, citing positive trends. He, however, said this week that schools would remain closed for the rest of the academic year. Murphy has said he wants to continue to see hospitalizations and the death toll, among other data, decline before he sets a full reopening date.ILLINOIS: The stay-home order lasts through May 30, and with it, schools remain on remote-learning status and nonessential businesses are closed. But as of May 1, nonessential businesses could fill phone and online orders. Some nonelective surgeries may resume, and many state parks are open for hiking and fishing.

Charlie Baker has set a date of May 18 to begin gradually reopening in Massachusetts, which is under a stay-at-home advisory. Baker has warned that the economy won’t be “off to the races” that day. He said phased-in reopening plans are being considered by a 17-member commission and will include social distancing and cleaning protocols for businesses.MARYLAND: Republican Gov. Larry Hogan says a gradual reopening will depend on downward virus trends. Last month, Hogan said he was hopeful Maryland could begin the first phase of reopening businesses in early May, but he hasn’t elaborated on a time.WISCONSIN: The stay-home order runs until May 26, but Republican legislative leaders are pressuring Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to reopen faster. Republicans also are asking the state Supreme Court to block the latest order and force Evers’ administration to bring lawmakers into the decision-making. Evers’ phased reopening plan requires 14-day improvements in certain key virus trends that have not been met.NEW MEXICO: Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham extended the stay-home order until May 15 but has begun modest moves to reduce business restrictions, recently allowing curbside and delivery operations for nonessential businesses, opening golf courses and some state parks, and allowing firearm sales by appointment.DELAWARE: Democratic Gov. John Carney has given no indication when he might lift restrictions, despite protests and pressure from GOP lawmakers. He has indicated that he will look closely at virus trends.MAINE: With a safer-at-home order lasting through May, restrictions were lifted May 1 on golf courses, many state parks and visits to dentists, barbers and hairdressers. Restrictions are set to lift for restaurants, lodging and camping June 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malls-movies-and-more-a-look-at-reopenings-by-us-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-pm0d1pcw0gidgDcw8ZijEK.html
05-05-2020||World||Amazon executive says he quit to protest employee firings||An Amazon executive said he quit his job at the online-retail giant to protest the firing of employees who spoke up about the conditions inside the company’s warehouses and its record on climate change.Tim Bray, a vice president at the company, wrote in a blog post that he left his job last week “in dismay” after Amazon fired several workers who publicly criticized the company. He said the firings were “evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture.”Amazon, which is based in Seattle, declined to comment.Among those fired was a New York warehouse worker who led a strike last month, pushing Amazon for more protections for workers against the new coronavirus. At the time, Amazon said the worker was fired for not obeying social-distancing rules.Bray, who said he worked at Amazon’s cloud business for more that five years, said he brought up the firings internally at the company.“That done, remaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised,” he wrote. “So I resigned.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-executive-says-he-quit-to-protest-employee-firings/story-DTmO72hNMXBiSqQtwM9oOJ.html
05-05-2020||World||Covid-19 pushing Trump administration to rip global supply chains from China: Officials||The Trump administration is “turbocharging” an initiative to remove global industrial supply chains from China as it weighs new tariffs to punish Beijing for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, according to officials familiar with U.S. planning.President Donald Trump, who has stepped up recent attacks on China ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, has long pledged to bring manufacturing back from overseas.Now, economic destruction and the U.S. coronavirus death toll are driving a government-wide push to move U.S. production and supply chain dependency away from China, even if it goes to other more friendly nations instead, current and former senior U.S. administration officials said. “We’ve been working on (reducing the reliance of our supply chains in China) over the last few years but we are now turbo-charging that initiative,” Keith Krach, undersecretary for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment at the State Department told Reuters. “I think it is essential to understand where the critical areas are and where critical bottlenecks exist,” Krach said, adding that the matter was key to U.S. security and one the government could announce new action on soon. The U.S. Commerce Department, State and other agencies are looking for ways to push companies to move both sourcing and manufacturing out of China. Tax incentives and potential re-shoring subsidies are among measures being considered to spur changes, the current and former officials told Reuters. “There is a whole of government push on this,” said one. Agencies are probing which manufacturing should be deemed “essential” and how to produce these goods outside of China.Trump’s China policy has been defined by behind-the-scenes tussles between pro-trade advisers and China hawks; now the latter say their time has come. “This moment is a perfect storm; the pandemic has crystallized all the worries that people have had about doing business with China,” said another senior U.S. official.“All the money that people think they made by making deals with China before, now they’ve been eclipsed many fold by the economic damage from the coronavirus”, the official said.Economic prosperity network Trump has said repeatedly that he could put new tariffs on top of the up to 25% tax on $370 billion in Chinese goods currently in place. U.S. companies, which pay the tariffs, are already groaning under the existing ones, especially as sales plummet during coronavirus lockdowns.But that does not mean Trump will balk at new ones, officials say. Other ways to punish China may include sanctions on officials or companies, and closer relations with Taiwan, the self-governing island China considers a province. Commerce on Monday launched a national security probe that could lead to new U.S. tariffs on imports of key components of power transformers, saying it needed assured domestic access to such goods to be able to respond to power disruptions.Discussions about moving supply chains are concrete, robust, and, unusually for the Trump administration, multi-lateral. The United States is pushing to create an alliance of “trusted partners” dubbed the “Economic Prosperity Network,” one official said. It would include companies and civil society groups operating under the same set of standards on everything from digital business, energy and infrastructure to research, trade, education and commerce, he said. The U.S. government is working with Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Vietnam to “move the global economy forward,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said April 29. These discussions include “how we restructure ... supply chains to prevent something like this from ever happening again,” Pompeo said.Latin America may play a role, too. Colombian Ambassador Francisco Santos last month said he was in discussions with the White House, National Security Council, Treasury Department and U.S. Chamber of Commerce about a drive to encourage U.S. companies to move some supply chains out of China and bring them closer to home. China overtook the United States as the world’s top manufacturing country in 2010, and was responsible for 28% of global output in 2018, according to United Nations data. The pandemic has highlighted China’s key role in the supply chain for generic drugs that account for the majority of prescriptions in the United States. It has also shown China’s dominance in goods like the thermal cameras needed to test workers for fevers, and its importance in food supplies. Hard sell for companies Many U.S. companies have invested heavily in Chinese manufacturing and rely on China’s 1.4 billion people for a big chunk of their sales. “Diversification and some redundancy in supply chains will make sense given the level of risk that the pandemic has uncovered,” said Doug Barry, spokesman for the U.S.-China Business Council. “But we don’t see a wholesale rush for the exits by companies doing business in China.”White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Monday said Trump had already signed an order that could allow limits on imports of components for the U.S. power grid from Russia and China, and would soon issue a separate order that would require federal agencies to purchase U.S.-made medical products.John Murphy, senior vice president for international policy at the Chamber of Commerce, said that U.S. manufacturers already meet 70% of current pharmaceutical demand.Building new facilities in the United States could take five to eight years, he said. “We’re concerned that officials need to get the right fact sets before they start looking at alternatives,” Murphy said. Trump White House pledges to punish China have not always been followed by action.A move to block global exports of chips to blacklisted Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, for example, favored by hawks in the administration and under consideration since November, has not yet been finalized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pushing-trump-administration-to-rip-global-supply-chains-from-china-officials/story-69swY606PA6RWoRdQumEIJ.html

He also emphasized that nations needed to ensure equitable distribution of the vaccine, once a suitable one is developed.ALSO READ | Ahead of WHO’s virtual meet, some real pressure on Tedros. And a complicationPolitical leaders of all major European countries on Monday called for cooperation and not competition in the quest for a vaccine for the coronavirus, as they pledged 7.4 billion euros at a fundraising teleconference that had been turned down by the United States.Major European nations, along with Japan and Canada, made some of the biggest contributions. The fund raising teleconference was, however, marred by the absence of any representation from the United States. President Donald Trump has been openly critical of the global health watchdog’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.In total around 40 countries, along with the United Nations and several philanthropic agencies that included the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and research institutes made donations for the coronavirus vaccine.President Trump who will contest for re-election later this year had said only a day earlier on Sunday, that the United States would have a coronavirus vaccine ready by the end of the year. Scientists and health experts across the globe, however, have warned against such optimism saying that it may take a few years for countries to develop an effective vaccine which would help tackle the contagious Covid-19 disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/billions-raised-for-covid-19-vaccine-display-powerful-show-of-global-solidarity-who-chief/story-zPE0JFhQ7uDRZCq2TDbu1L.html

The standard operating procedure (SOP) is being prepared by the ICMR. Its SOP came late in the evening and the CM‘s version was based on some hearsay. We will bring back people only after tests,” he told Hindustan Times.During his daily press briefing the CM said the Centre’s plan to bring back Indians stranded abroad without testing for coronavirus was fraught with heavy risks. He also said only 80,000 Indians will be evacuated and Kannur airport was left out of the evacuation itinerary.“We never mentioned any numbers. A section of the medial is going all around with a draft prepared in the morning. That is not right. We will finalize all our plans later tonight. There is no confusion on our part. Let the CM check his facts first before giving sweeping statements,” he said The junior foreign minister also said that all four international airports in Kerala including Kannur will be part of the evacuation exercise.More than four lakh people have registered in an online portal which the state government launched last week to facilitate the return of Malayalees stranded in other countries. But the CM said the Centre has made it clear that such a massive evacuation was not possible at this juncture and people who are on priority list will be evacuated. The central minister refuted that claim as well. “The Union Government did not say anything about this,” Muraleedharan insisted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-spreading-misinformation-about-evacuation-says-junior-mea/story-pDKqhKicpOtDB0rkgwW13M.html
05-05-2020||India||87% urban Indians give thumbs up to govt’s handling of Covid-19 crisis: Survey||A survey on Tuesday showed a majority of urban Indians, precisely 87 per cent of those polled, have given high ratings to the Narendra Modi government for its handling of the Covid-19 crisis.Multinational market research firm Ipsos conducted this survey from April 23-26 by seeking responses from about 26,000 people across 13 countries. A majority of people in 9 out of 13 countries felt that their government was doing a good job of containing the spread of Covid-19, it said.In India also, “people’s report card on the Modi government’s handling of Covid-19 crisis is out! ...an overwhelming 87 per cent of urban Indians giving the government high ratings”. Apart from 87 per cent people in urban areas of India, most people in Australia (84 per cent), Canada (81 per cent), Germany (75 per cent) and Italy (61 per cent) were of the view that their government handled Covid-19 crisis well, according to the survey.While those in Japan (62 per cent) and the hard-hit European countries of Spain (60 per cent) and France (51 per cent), and Russia (47 per cent) felt their government did poor job in managing the crisis.“Government was quick to enforce a total lockdown and took a number of bold, precautionary measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Now, the government is considering a cautious, partial re-opening in the green zones. Government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic has been lauded by the majority of the populace, polled in the survey,” said Amit Adarkar, Ipsos India CEO.   After facing a lot of initial flak worldwide on the handling and seriousness of the pandemic, the role of the World Health Organization (WHO) has found favour with the majority of people in 11 out of the 13 countries surveyed in containing the spread of Covid-19, but this sentiment has fallen since March in nine out of 12 countries where Ipsos has tracked opinions.About 75 per cent of the urban Indians surveyed positively view the role of the WHO in containing the spread of the virus, although there is a dip from the previous survey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/87-urban-indians-give-thumbs-up-to-govt-s-handling-of-covid-19-crisis-survey/story-0Ql5dKi3pEtxFavfSp84HJ.html
05-05-2020||India||Excise duty on petrol raised by Rs 10, diesel by Rs 13 per litre; no change in prices||The Centre on Tuesday evening raised the excise duty on petrol by Rs 10 and on diesel by 13 per litre to recoup some of the loss of revenue suffered by the government due to the Covid-19 lockdown.The change in duties will come into effect from 6 May, an official notification said.The change in the tax structure will not impact the retail sale price of petrol and diesel on account of the excise duty hike.A central government official said the revenue generated from these duties shall be used for infrastructure and other developmental items of expenditure.A Re 1 per litre increase in excise duty on petrol and diesel usually means an additional Rs 14,500 crore in annual revenue to the government. But the revenue will accrue only when demand for the fuel, curtailed due to the extended lockdown, rises substantially.The Centre’s move comes a day after the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi increased value-added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel to raise money to fight the coronavirus disease. This decision had increased the price of petrol by Rs 1.67 per litre to Rs 71.26 and diesel, by Rs 7.10 to Rs 69.39.That decision was sharply criticised by the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress in Delhi. Outside of politics, there has been some recognition that this might be the only way for governments that are running out of money to pay employees salaries.By evening, according to news agency ANI, Congress-ruled Punjab decided to hike the price of petrol and diesel by Rs 2 per litre. Telangana’s K Chandrasekhar Rao, on the other hand, announced the decision to raise the price of liquor by 16 per cent.A few hours later, came the Union finance ministry order.This is the second time since March that the Centre raised duty on petrol and diesel.On March 14, the Centre had raised duties on petrol and diesel to Rs 3 per litre. That hike had raised the total central levies on petrol to Rs 22.98 per litre and on diesel to Rs 18.83 per litre. The retail price of the fuel had, however, remained unchanged because of the decline in crude prices.Since March 16, oil companies have abandoned the practice of daily revision of the two fuel rates, making up for present and potential inventory losses..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/excise-duty-on-petrol-raised-by-rs-10-diesel-by-rs-13-per-litre-no-change-in-prices/story-RVV2cqnus4hEUYN1qrQfcP.html

But the start of their journey might spill over to tomorrow,” a railway official said.Gujarat was the originating station for around 35 of these trains, followed by Kerala with 13. Among the receiving states, Bihar has accepted 13 trains, with 11 more currently on the journey and six in the pipeline, data accessed by PTI shows. Neighbouring Uttar Pradesh has received 10 such trains and five more are on their way with 12 in the pipeline, the data shows.The West Bengal government has, however, given clearance to only two trains -- one each from Rajasthan and Kerala -- and they are on their journeys to the state.Jharkhand has accepted four trains, while five are on their way to the state. Two more Shramik Special trains are in the pipeline. Odisha has received seven trains and five are on their way to the state, with one more in the pipeline, the data shows. These 24 coach trains, which have a capacity of 72 seats, is now reduced to 54 due to social distancing norms with the middle seat not being allotted to any passenger.While the Railways has officially not stated how much it has spent so far on these services, which the government says will be shared between the Centre and state in 85:15 ratio, officials indicated that around Rs 50 crore have been incurred on 67 trains operated till Tuesday morning.Sources said that the Railways is spending around Rs 80 lakh per service for the Shramik Special trains. Earlier, the Railways drew a lot of flak from opposition parties for making these services chargeable.In its guidelines, the Railways had said the trains will ply only if they have 90 per cent occupancy and the “states should collect the ticket fare”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-railways-ferries-over-70-000-migrants-in-76-shramik-specials-in-5-days/story-yJKjKJInZmhuZLHeMahijN.html

Of the new cases, 841 were reported in the last 24 hours, while remaining 143 were carried forward from the last few days as per the central government’s directive to bring the data at par with the national figures on the website of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the state government stated. 635 new cases were from Mumbai, which also saw 26 deaths on Tuesday. Six deaths were reported from Pune and one each from Aurangabad and Kolhapur. At least 14 of the deceased on Tuesday were above 60 years of age, while 28 had high-risk comorbidities. The mortality rate in the state stood at 4.01%, down from 7.21% on April 12, but the number of deaths, 299, in the past ten days since April 26 has increased. The country’s mortality rate hovers around 3.23%.State government has directed the district collectors and municipal commissioners to concentrate on the containment zones fearing their monitoring may become difficult after the additional relaxations in the lockdown came into effect from Monday. “There are complaints of crowding in many places after liquor and other non-essential shops were allowed to operate. Restricting the spread from the Red and containment zones will become more important after the relaxations. The clampdown in containment zones, especially in MMR and PMR should not be relaxed at any cost,” a government’s directive to the district authorities said. According to the officials, despite chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s directive to districts, the full containment of coronavirus by May end looks difficult.“He has set the target and asked the authorities to ensure the strictest monitoring under the principle of 3-Ts (tracing, testing and treatment) in containment areas. He has also asked them to focus on shrinking the containment zones to neutralize the areas. Though the cases are not expected to come to nil so soon, we expect a downward trend to begin by then,” said an official.The official said that though there are various projections about the curve of the disease’s spread, the government expects the downward trend to begin in the next two to three weeks.Dr TP Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research, said, “Almost all the contacts of positive patients are traced and will be quarantined in next ten days. During this period the rate of growth in cases will move northward and once two weeks of quarantine is over, we expect a drastic fall in the numbers by the end of this month.” Officials said that May 31 target to flatten the curve was set to contain the spread effectively enabling the lifting of the lockdown in Mumbai, Pune and other cities. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesMeanwhile, the state government issued a clarification saying there would be no restrictions on the number of days in a week or on the number of hours a shop can operate unless specified by the municipal commissioners and the district collectors.“All shops and markets which are allowed to remain open as per the order shall remain open to their full operations timing and day. However, the municipal commissioners in Mumbai Metropolitan Region and Pune Metropolitan Region, Nagpur, Nashik and Aurangabad and district collectors in other areas will have the right to decide on the timing of operation in case there is need of regulating these commercial activities. “There were too many authorities issuing orders without any uniformity on the timing and days at the local level. This order brings clarity,” said Bhushan Gagarani, principal secretary, Maharashtra government.Late on Tuesday, Mumbai civic body issued a notification saying liquor shops and non-essential goods shops will not be allowed in the city to prevent crowding.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that the recovery rate in Maharashtra has improved.“As many as 354 patients were sent home after they recovered from the infection fully. This was the highest single-day recovery since the first patient was reported on March 9. We are conducting more than 7000 tests in 45 laboratories daily and the number is highest in the country,” he said.In the past 24 hours, the state has carried out 6,561 coronavirus tests and 12.81% of the total people tested were found positive. The total number of tests conducted in the state so far reached 1,82,884 on Tuesday including 1,67,205 negative results.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19199,182 people are currently under home quarantine, while 12,456 are under institutional quarantine. 11,629 teams of health workers have screened 50.81 lakh suspects.Meanwhile, some districts namely Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg and some municipal authorities, namely in Ulhasnagar and Kalyan Dombivali, have been imposing restrictions on the movement of people from Mumbai, the worst-hit city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-maharashtra-tally-past-15-000-mumbai-nearing-10-000-mark/story-XPBhAIHy9oc4rcSmZ40apN.html

The international community is well aware of it and recognises that this is a propaganda exercise that they go through.”The person added, “The international community is also well aware of our position on this issue and I don’t think we need to really dignify this with any response.”In his speech, Alvi didn’t name India but referred to attempts to discriminate against and demonise Muslims in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking before Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he also referred to Islamophobia, hate speech, the “scapegoating” of a community and denial of medical facilities to this community in Pakistan’s “immediate neighbourhood”.Alvi, a close aide of Prime Minister Imran Khan, also highlighted the condition of the Kashmiri people and said their sufferings were compounded by a communications blackout and lack of unfettered access to medical and other essential facilities and high speed internet. He also criticised what he said were efforts to change the demographic profile of the region.In his speech, Modi, without naming any country, said: “Even as the world fights Covid-19, some people are busy spreading other deadly viruses such as terrorism, fake news and doctored videos to divide communities and countries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-s-reference-to-kashmir-at-nam-summit-was-propaganda-exercise-says-govt/story-w4UCbcPFMuDqTEjAeldE3K.html

Those who are comfortably placed and have no compelling reason to return shouldn’t make travel plans, the people said on condition of anonymity.“The numbers are quite significant…More than 300,000 people have registered in the Gulf region alone but we will only bring back those registered as compelling cases. The missions will determine the compelling cases,” said one of the people cited above.The first phase of the programme will focus on those facing deportation, those who have been laid off, those having non-permanent residency or holding short-term visas whose visas have expired, those with medical emergencies or seeking treatment for terminal illnesses, pregnant women and the elderly, those returning due to a death in the family, tourists stranded abroad, and students whose hostels and institutions have closed because of the Covid-19 crisis.“If you are living in another country and you’re comfortable, this is not the time to plan your return,” the person said. “In the immediate future, we can’t bring back everyone but we’ll bring back those who have a genuine reason to come back.”The first wave of flights will bring back Indians from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, the US, the UK, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines, and the programme will be expanded later to other countries such as Sri Lanka and Afghanistan, the people said.While leaving India, the flights can carry citizens of the destination country, Indians with one-year visas for the destination country, green card or OCI card holders, and Indians with six-month visas who wish to travel for a medical emergency, the people said.More than 10,000 Indians living in West Asian countries have tested positive for Covid-19 and 84 have died, a second person said. The people said the arrangements for repatriation will be as watertight as possible to ensure there is no further spread of the virus. Passengers will be screened and only asymptomatic people will be allowed to travel, and they will have to undergo further tests and quarantine on reaching India.In the case of the UAE, all passengers will have to undergo rapid antibody tests, the people added.Though hundreds of thousands of Indian nationals have registered to return, the people said there were already numerous instances of people dropping out after finding out about the stringent conditions related to screening and quarantine.External affairs minister S Jaishankar and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla are overseeing process of coordinating with foreign governments, Indian missions and state governments. Jaishankar has been holding meetings with other ministries and had a video conference with heads of missions in some of the countries from which Indians are returning, including the UAE, Singapore, the Maldives and the US.At least 20 senior officials of the external affairs ministry have been selected to liaise with the states to which the Indian nationals will return, such as Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Haryana. The foreign secretary will have a video conference with chief secretaries of several states on Wednesday for coordination, the people said.The external affairs ministry will upload all information on the people returning to the country on an online digital platform that will be accessible to other ministries and state governments. The data on those who lost their jobs will help state governments rehabilitate these workers by including them in national or state government employment programmes or in private sector jobs, the second person said.The people insisted that the massive programme was not an evacuation because it is not a government-sponsored exercise. “What we are doing is facilitating the return of our nationals back to the country,” the first person said, adding the government had negotiated very competitive rates for the flights. For instance, the cost of the flight from West Asian countries was about Rs 15,500 per person.The people said there were about 14 million Indian nationals spread around the world, including nearly nine million in the West Asian countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-300-000-indians-register-to-return-from-gulf-region-only-those-with-compelling-reasons-to-be-brought-back-in-first-phase/story-A4qNuaOzlJVQnIclILXxgO.html

Farooq Abdullah had been released early last month.Earlier, Mufti was lodged a government guesthouse in Chashma Shahi and a bunglow on Maulana Azad Road near Lal Chowk.Daughter of Mehbooba, Iltija has moved a habeas corpus petition before the Supreme Court in February challenging her mother’s detention.A three-judge bench had issued a notice to the Jammu and Kashmir administration seeking its response on the plea and posted the matter for a hearing on March 18. However, the petition was not taken up for hearing due to the coronavirus outbreak.Habeas corpus is a writ seeking production of a person supposed to be in illegal detention before a court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehbooba-mufti-s-detention-under-psa-extended-by-three-months/story-OPA40WgmePxdmI1V5zSs7N.html
05-05-2020||India||Our family of apps playing critical role in challenging times: Facebook India exec||Ajit Mohan, Facebook India’s vice-president and managing director, told HT in an interview that the company is working on a longer shelf life for Instagram live videos after a 60% rise in views during the lockdown. As part of the Facebook-Jio deal, he said, digital tools will be made available to workers of the MSME sector. Edited excerpts: The Facebook-Jio deal is in the news. What more can Facebook users in India expect out of this deal? How will it help the country’s MSME sector?Facebook and Jio platforms will work in tandem to further accelerate India’s exciting digital transformation and open up new opportunities for people and businesses around the country. An early focus area for us would be about giving MSMEs access to digital tools that will empower them to grow and expand their businesses while helping them connect with their customers. The Covid-19 pandemic has come with a deluge of misinformation. Facebook has taken several steps. For instance, it has joined hands with Poynter Institute for Media Studies and International Centre for Journalists to help combat fake news. WhatsApp has tweaked some of its features to contain the spread of swirling rumours, and there are fresh curbs on advertisers as well. Are there any more plans for a change in Facebook’s features?Facebook family of is are playing a critical role in the lives of people around the globe during these challenging times, as users are leveraging our platforms more than ever to connect with their friends and family. As India fights the Covid-19 outbreak, we have stepped up our efforts to respond to the crisis. A big part of our efforts has been to ensure that everyone has access to accurate information and that we do everything we can to reduce misinformation and harmful content. We are grateful for our partnership with the government, local authorities, and health organisations and will continue to evolve our products and services in the fight against the viral outbreak. Globally, we have directed over two billion people to resources from the WHO (World Health Organisation) and other health authorities through our Coronavirus Information Center and pop-ups on Facebook and Instagram with over 350 million people clicking on them to learn more. In March, we displayed warnings on about 40 million posts related to Covid-19 on Facebook globally, based on around 4,000 articles by our independent fact-checking partners. When people saw those warning labels, 95% of the time they did not go on to view the original content. In India, we work with eight independent third-party fact-checking partners in 11 vernacular languages and English.On Facebook and Instagram, we reduce the distribution of content that our partners consider as fake. If users still see these fake content on their news feed, we attach a warning label of the misinformation along with a link to a fact-checked article.WhatsApp has recently announced limiting highly-forwarded messages to only one chat. Globally, there has been a 70% reduction in the number of highly-forwarded messages sent on WhatsApp after this new restriction came into effect. This change is helping WhatsApp’s use only for personal and private conversations.Between the coronavirus WhatsApp helpline and the Facebook messenger chatbot, how many people would you say have been reached out to in India alone? Is there any behavioural insight that has emerged from the number of interactions on these two platforms? At Facebook, we have taken several measures to ensure everyone has access to accurate information. With specific reference to the Facebook Messenger Chatbot, we launched the MyGov Corona Hub chatbot on Facebook Messenger in partnership with MyGov and MOHFW in April to raise awareness, provide authentic and accurate information and bust fake news about coronavirus. Our partnership has extended to nine state governments today (Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh) and the chatbots are now available in Telugu, Kannada , Marathi, Odia, and Punjabi apart from Hindi and English. We have also added capabilities such as state-specific helpline numbers and testing centres, among others. In addition, MyGov and MOHFW, along with WhatsApp, launched a helpline number to raise awareness and answer questions about the coronavirus. By the end of March, over 2 crore people had messaged the helpline number for information.We are making product changes in our apps. To tackle misinformation on WhatsApp, the most recent product change was limiting frequently forwarded messages (i.e. messages containing double arrows)  to one chat at a time, to control the spread of viral messages. Since putting into place this new limit, globally there has been a 70% reduction in the number of highly forwarded messages sent on WhatsApp. We also provide general education on tips to prevent the spread of rumours and fake news, and worked with partners across civil society and engaged with relevant government authorities and other technology platforms to help address the harmful consequences of misinformation. Instagram live videos attracted some prominent artists and celebrities to perform live from within the confines of their homes amid the lockdown restrictions. Is there any plan to make Instagram live videos accessible for more than 24 hours? Will there be a paywall for Instagram live videos?Instagram is the home of creativity and expression and at a time when social distancing is the new normal, we are seeing this in an even more prominent way than ever before. Culture is going virtual and the increase of Instagram live views by 60% in India is an indication of that. We are also seeing an exponential rise in interactivity with the release of new tools and features like co-watching on Instagram, the ‘Stay Home’ & ‘Ghar Pe Raho’ stickers, etc.We know people are using Instagram to stay connected and entertained. Now, users can view live content from Instagram on their desktops as well. We are also testing a way for users to save live videos to IGTV (Instagram TV), so they stick around longer than the 24-hour limit in stories and are also easier to access.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/our-family-of-apps-playing-critical-role-in-challenging-times-facebook-india-exec/story-UQVXaiwPuqxfklSz5DNHUM.html

The development comes a day after Ahmedabad recorded the highest number of positive cases and deaths in a single day and coincided with a worried state government deciding to rope in the services of private health experts to bring down the mortality rate in the city, which is much higher than the national average. “I came into contact with two persons during my field visits, who tested positive subsequently As per existing guidelines, I have been advised self-isolation at home for 14 days. Looking forward to rejoining the FightAgainst Coved 19 very soon,” tweeted Vijay Nehra.A record 26 people succumbed to the Covid-19 disease in hotspot Ahmedabad on Monday and 259 new coronavirus positive cases were recorded in Gujarat’s biggest city. Ahmedabad had reported 23 Covid-19 casualties on Sunday and 20 fatalities on Saturday.Ahmedabad has so far reported 4,076 coronavirus cases and 234 deaths, said news agency PTI. The city’s Covid-19 death rate stands at 5.8 per cent as on Tuesday, against the national average of around 3.2 per cent.A worried Gujarat government on Tuesday decided to rope in private intensive care specialists to advise the government doctors in Ahmedabad civil hospital for containment of Covid-19 death rate in the city.“We have decided to rope in private critical care specialists, who have agreed to give their special service in the wake of the pandemic. On Monday, we had a meeting of our Ahmedabad civil hospital team with some of these specialists,” said state principal secretary (health) Jayanti Ravi said.Ahmedabad has reported a staggering 73.3 per cent of the total 319 deaths in Gujarat so far.Vijay Nehra had said last week that the high death rate in Ahmedabad was because people were reporting late for admission in hospitals and more lives could be saved if people visited hospitals immediately after showing symptoms for the disease.He said that the corporation had focusing on potential super spreaders and people like vegetable vendors and shopkeepers, who he said were more likely to spread the disease at a faster clip.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesNehra had pointed out the silver lining among the dark clouds and said that the doubling rate of the disease in the city had increased to eight days by April 27-28 from 3-4 days between April 15-20.“We would be getting 2,000 cases per day with a four-day doubling rate and 1000 cases a day with a eight-day doubling rate. It is, however, getting stabilised.

After assuming the chief minister’s post on November 28 , he is constitutionally bound to get elected to either the legislative assembly or the legislative council within six months or by May 27. He is likely to be elected unopposed.The state cabinet twice recommended to governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari that he be nominated one of the two vacant legislative council seats under the governor’s quota.Thackeray called Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 29 to caution him about an impending constitutional crisis if the governor denied he cabinet’s demand.Next day, Koshyari urged the Election Commission to hold elections “at the earliest” to the nine legislative council seats that have been vacant since April 24. The last date of filing nominations is May 11 and the last date of withdrawal is May 14.In the 288-member assembly, the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has the support of 169 legislators. While the Shiv Sena has 56 legislators, the NCP’s strength is 54 followed by the Congress with 44 and others 15.The opposition has 115 legislators, including 105 from the BJP and eight independents. Four others are not supporting either combination.A Congress functionary said on condition of anonymity that the MVA is in talks with the independents and smaller parties, including the Communist Party of India (Marxist), to seek their supportIf they agree, the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress will get two seats each.Apart from Thackeray, the Shiv Sena is likely to renominate Neelam Gorhe.From the Congress, many leaders, including Rajni Patil, Hussain Dalwai, Manickrao Thakre, Muzaffar Hussain and Arif Naseem Khan have staked their claim for a nomination .The BJP says it can win four seats.“We do not anticipate any trouble in getting four of our candidates elected provided the ruling side does not try to overstretch and sticks to nominating only five candidates,” a BJP functionary said, requesting anonymity.“Normally when such an election takes place where a chief minister or a minister has to be elected all parties are usually keen on the elections being held unopposed. Hopefully, the ruling party will see reason and not push for a situation where election will be required,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uddhav-led-maha-alliance-set-to-win-5-of-9-seats-in-legislative-council-polls/story-1QQoSEFBPd2UYQi9ECoGeJ.html
05-05-2020||India||After migrants, Congress says will foot bill for stranded students, pilgrims||A day after Congress president Sonia Gandhi asked all state units to pay for the train journeys of stranded migrant workers who are headed home, the party on Tuesday extended the offer to students and pilgrims who cannot afford the cost of travel.Congress general secretary in-charge of the organization, KC Venugopal, wrote to the party’s state units, asking them to cover the train fare of students and pilgrims as well, besides migrant workers. State units were told to make sure such people aren’t required to pay the one-way train fare to their destinations if they cannot afford to do so..Pradesh Congress Committees were told to form advisory committees to frame guidelines and oversee implementation of the initiative, including outreach, identification and reimbursement of beneficiaries besides coordinating with officers appointed by state governments to ensure the orderly movement of migrant workers.Through another circular, Venugopal also directed the state units to establish help desks with dedicated helpline numbers to enable the stranded migrant workers to approach them.“There should be extensive social media campaigns through all platforms. The migrant workers can be reached out by circulating a Google form to collect the travel details such as contact, source and destination,” read the circular.The state units were also directed to deploy teams at each railway station to coordinate the departure of migrant workers and make payments to the railway authorities. In another move, the Congress sought voluntary contributions from the public to meet the travel expenses of migrant labourers.Gandhi’s announcement on Monday that her party would bear the cost of travel of migrant workers who, the Congress alleged were being forced to pay the train fare, triggered a war of words with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The opposition party accused the government of being insensitive to the plight of stranded migrant workers; the BJP rebutted the claim, saying the railways was paying 85% and state governments the remainder, entailing no cost to the workers.Gandhi on Tuesday called a meeting of the chief ministers of Congress-ruled states and senior leaders on Wednesday to discuss issues related to the coronavirus pandemic and the impact of the prolonged lockdown on the economy.Meanwhile, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati said it was unfortunate that the Centre and the state governments were charging money from stranded migrant workers for ferrying them home and also offered to pay for their travel. “If governments hesitate in paying the fare of the migrants, the BSP will take help of its cadre and will contribute in making arrangements for these workers,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-migrants-congress-says-will-foot-bill-for-stranded-students-pilgrims/story-BgxmeAhi6ZcSaPTYsVUb6M.html
05-05-2020||India||GoM led by Harsh Vardhan holds Covid-19 review meeting||A group of ministers (GoM) headed by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan held a review meeting on Tuesday, discussing the strategies India has formulated to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and identifying possible loopholes in implementation.In the 14th meeting of the group since February, a presentation on the Covid-19 cases globally and within the country was made, according to a health ministry statement.“The Group of Ministers had in-depth deliberation on containment strategy and management aspects of COVID-19, as well as the measures being taken by the Centre and various States,” the statement said.Civil aviation minister Hardeep S Puri, foreign minister S Jaishankar, MoS home Nityanand Rai, MoS health and family welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey, chief of defence staff Bipin Rawat, and Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla were present at the meeting.Separately, speaking to news agency PTI, Vardhan said India has so far been able to stave off community transmission of Covid-19, expressing hope that “behavioural changes” brought about by the infection could become the “new normal” for a healthy society after the pandemic abates.Community transmission takes place when a person tests positive for the disease but doctors are not able to trace the source of the infection. It indicates undiagnosed and asymptomatic people are unknowingly spreading the infection, which makes it difficult to break the chain of transmission.“By now we know that fighting coronavirus is no rocket science. If behavioural changes such as hand, environmental and respiratory hygiene, which are being practised more rigorously during this period, get imbibed in society it will become the new normal,” Vardhan said.“Once the havoc caused by the virus subsides and the crisis blows over, people may remember it as a blessing in disguise,” Vardhan added.At the GoM meeting, measures pertaining to strengthening health care capacity of states, including devoting adequate resources for creating dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, and equipping medical facilities with adequate personal protection equipment (PPE) kits, ventilators and other essential equipment were discussed.A senior official present at the meeting described it as a stocktaking exercise.“All members discussed steps that were taken by the Centre and how well the states implemented the directives. The gaps were identified, and what improvements are needed and in which areas (were discussed) to check the spread of the infection and bring down the number of deaths,” the senior official said, requesting not to be named.The health ministry statement said the GoM “highlighted the need for ensuring that stringent measures of quality control were taken for PPE kits, masks, ventilators etc”.“Random batch sampling for ensuring compliance and adherence to the quality standards laid down were also needed,” it added.The production of essential medical equipment in India has seen a significant growth with domestic manufacturers reaching the production capacity of nearly 250,000 PPE kits and about 200,000 N-95 masks per day.In addition, the manufacturing of ventilators by domestic players has also been started and orders placed. Steps have been taken to maintain the quality norms for PPE, masks and ventilators. Oxygen cylinders are also being procured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gom-led-by-harsh-vardhan-holds-covid-19-review-meeting/story-3D7rLKK8hlmgKDCy5H3Q6O.html

This came almost two weeks after former Health Minister of Tripura Sudip Roy Barman raised an allegation of embezzlement of government funds to purchase kits to prevent Covid-19. The state government assured to take action against their complaints within 24 hours without revealing the complainants’ identities. Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb took to his Twitter saying , “ Our aim is Zero tolerance policy against corruption. To bring more transparency in Governance, we are launching a Whatsaap no : 8794534501, where you can complain with evidence regarding any corruption and we will take action within 24 hours. Your identity will be kept secret.” After coming to power in 2018 for the first time in Tripura, the BJP-IPFT government announced zero tolerance to corruption. Roy Barman wrote to chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb on April 23 regarding the alleged corruption, estimated to be around Rs. 39.28 lakh. After two days, reacting to the former minister’s allegation of misappropriation of funds, the state government removed the then secretary of Health Department Dr. Debasish Basu and National Health Mission director Aditi Majumder from their positions. They also constituted an inquiry committee comprising of two members to conduct an inquiry into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-launches-whatsapp-number-to-register-corruption-complaints/story-0A3mrXxHCdXNnPXVGW94DO.html
05-05-2020||India||‘Can’t take risks’: Kerala CM on flying back Indians without Covid-19 test||Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday said the Centre’s plan to bring back Indians stranded abroad without testing them for coronavirus was fraught with risks. Beginning Thursday, around 15,000 stranded Indians are expected to be flown back to India in 64 flights in a mammoth exercise to evacuate stranded Indians from abroad.“Many of them are coming without tests there. So we can’t take any risk at this point. It would have been ideal if they undergo tests before taking flights,” said the Kerala CM in a letter to PM Modi.In each flight at least 200 passengers are likely to come and in case there are one or two infected people among them, there are chances of other passengers getting infected, Vijayan said.Earlier the state was planning to send the returnees to their homes after screening with a strict instruction to remain in quarantine for two weeks. The state changed its plan after it came to know that most of them won’t undergo tests before boarding the flight. The state had insisted to bring back only who have certified that they are Covid-free, but the Centre said that it will be difficult in the present scenario to get them tested.At the time of boarding the plane or ship, the passengers will be put through thermal screening as per health protocol. Also, only asymptomatic travellers would be allowed to make the journey.The CM underlined that there should not be any lapse in following internationally accepted health protocols or else it will be a blow to the state’s efforts to prevent community spread of Covid-19.During the journey, the passengers are expected to wear masks, maintain environmental, respiratory and hand hygiene.Upon arrival the passengers will mandatorily be kept under institutional quarantine for a minimum period of 14 days, the cost of which will be borne by them. More than four lakh people have registered with the state government to facilitate their return to the country. The CM pointed out that the Centre has made it clear that such a massive evacuation was not possible at this juncture and people who are on priority list will be evacuated.The government has said priority will be given to those migrant labourers/workers abroad who have been laid off, short term visa holders faced with expiry of visa, pregnant women, elderly, faced with medical emergency or wants to return to India due to death in family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-take-risks-kerala-cm-on-flying-back-indians-without-covid-19-test/story-fQ5RV7t3Me17Lk3jZOWegK.html
05-05-2020||India||‘Let Congress keep the money’: Kerala CM refuses party aid for migrants’ train fares||The Kerala government on Tuesday turned down the Congress party’s offer to bear the train fare of migrant workers triggering a war of words with the opposition parties, while the migrants cried foul over the lost offer to cover their travel expense. In Alappuzha, the district Congress committee’s Rs 10 lakh cheque was refused by district collector M Anjana, who cited absence of any legal provision for accepting such assistance. The offer was made before a train with 1,140 migrant workers left the state for Bihar.“We were told each worker paid Rs 930 for the ticket, at least Rs 200 more than the normal rate. We approached the collector with a cheque of Rs 10 lakh but she said there is no provision to accept it. It is unfair. These people are without work for more than a month. How can the state and railways fleece them like this?” Alappuzha DCC president M Liju fumed. Similarly, in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram cheques were turned down by district collectors. Meanwhile, three trains left Kerala carrying workers on Tuesday.“It is time for Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to shed his arrogance. They were without jobs for more than a month and most of them really struggled to cough up money for the tickets,” said AICC general secretary K C Venugopal, decrying the government move. Later Congress workers carried out protests in Alappuzha and Kochi.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan later played down the whole issue saying it was an arrangement made by the railways and the state has no role in it. “We know the Congress has enough money. Let it keep the money. If they have some complaint they can talk to the railways,” he said.The migrant labourers, meanwhile, said that it was cruel on part of the Kerala government to reject the offer made by the Congress. “It is a pity that the government blocked the move to fund our tickets. Some of us literally begged to meet the ticket fare,” said one labourer, who added that it was “wrong to do politics over humanitarian issues”. But the ruling CPI(M) said it was the Congress that was playing “cheap politics”.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesCongress president Sonia Gandhi had on Monday attacked the union government for charging train fare from migrant labourers and announced that her party will bear the cost of travel of all stranded workers due to the coronavirus lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-congress-keep-the-money-kerala-cm-refuses-party-aid-for-migrants-train-fares/story-FkUbSNll4rSw0yKX6Y4AkK.html

The camp houses 22nd battalion of the ITBP, which has strength of around 1,000 personnel who all are under observation while 76 of them are in quarantine.The decision to seal the Tigri camp came after 23 more men tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday.“We are trying to identify the source of infection in the force but preliminary assessment is that a retired ITBP officer, who was staying at Tigri camp and died due to Covid-19 on Sunday at Safdarjung hospital could be the carrier. The retired officer had contracted Covid-19 infection sometime in mid-April but there were other comorbidity factors due to which he died,” said an officer, who did not wish to be named.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.Subsequently, ITBP suspects that some of the personnel may have contracted the infection during law and order duties in different parts of Delhi along with the Delhi Police.Out of these, 43 personnel were those deployed for internal security duties in the national capital while two were deployed for law and order duty with the Delhi Police, the ITBP said in a statement.ITBP reported its first Covid-19 case April 28. On Monday, the number reached 21 before it more than doubled to 45 on Tuesday. Forty three of these are from Tigri camp while two are stationed at Rohini for law and order duties.The central paramilitary forces, also called Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), have reported a total of 311 from across the country till Tuesday out of which 298 are active cases.

Initial interrogation of the terrorists arrested in this operation, however, have led Indian security agencies to conclude that there were half-a-dozen more camps.Counter-terror officials in Delhi and Kabul said the Jaish-e-Mohammed had already readied 400 fighters at these camps set up after the Taliban signed the 29 February pact with the US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad.The pact, which requires the Afghan forces and the Taliban to release prisoners from the other side, paves the way for the US and other foreign forces to quit Afghanistan.“Jaish cadres have been deployed with Taliban units in areas between Khost to Jalalabad in east Afghanistan and also in areas close to the Pakistan border in Kandahar province,” a counter terror official in Kabul confirmed.Officials said the synergy between the Taliban and the Jaish-e-Mohammed - some intel reports say the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba have also sent its cadres for training to the Jaish camps - is being anchored by Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence.Zerar, one of the Jaish operatives arrested by the Afghan forces in follow-up action, has told interrogators that the training base busted by the forces were being “trained, equipped and supported by Pakistan military personnel”. Many of them, he said, had escaped in the fire cover provided by Pakistan military personnel to help them escape. Zerar, identified as a resident of Pakistan capital Islamabad, was among them. He was arrested three days later, on April 15.The terror group founded by Maulana Masood Azhar is being run by his younger brother Mufti Abdul Rauf Asghar since Masood Azhar, who was designated as a global terrorist by the United Nations last year, has been terminally ill.Diplomats in Kabul say Masood Azhar’s elder brother, Ibrahim Azhar, has been spotted in Ghazni city in central Afghanistan, possibly in context of the effort to deepen ties with the Taliban.The training camps remain under overall charge of Mufti Asghar Kashmiri, commander of Jaish’s Kashmir operations who has been spotted around terrorist launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The Afghan war veteran Mufti Asghar Kashmiri, who was once with the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, oversees the operational aspects of the infiltration from Leepa valley that leads to Kupwara in north Kashmir and has been the favoured route for terrorists over the last few weeks.In the two-day operation that gave security officials an insight into the extent of Jaish presence in Afghanistan, Afghan security officials had targeted a Jaish-e-Mohammed base set up in coordination with Taliban in the Ghorak-e-Mohmand area of Momand Dara, a district in the east of Nangarhar Province near the Durand Line across Torkham was demolished. At least 14 Jaish cadres were killed and a weapons depot destroyed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/next-wave-of-400-jaish-terrorists-for-kashmir-could-be-from-its-afghan-camps/story-MUJTQWvy4LtMC7nLHKVRFL.html

Aarogya Setu is India’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) contact-tracing app. Singapore has a similar mobile app called TraceTogether for contact tracing. Earlier, former Congress president criticised the mandatory use of the app. He said it was akin to a “sophisticated surveillance system”. He further added that “fear must not be leveraged to track citizens without their consent”. The government said priority will be given to those migrant labourers/workers abroad who have been laid off, short term visa holders faced with expiry of visa, pregnant women, elderly, faced with medical emergency or wants to return to India due to death in family.The MHA orders also mandates that passengers mandatorily undergo institutional quarantine for a minimum period of 14 days upon arrival, the cost of which will be borne by them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-centre-s-plan-to-get-indians-abroad-home-aarogya-setu-app-must/story-2VJSFaKIOOTB6a824eIQLJ.html

HT visited Nurpur, Karot, Daulatpur and Bagai villages on the border with Uttar Pradesh.“We have broken all links with Agra and Mathura. We have also decided to patrol the areas at night to prevent any movement from UP,” said Sukhveer Singh of Nurpur village.Vijay Singh of Karot village said the dirt tracks have been in use even during the lockdown. “Even during the movement of migrant labourers, when police stopped them on highways, they took the village roads to cross over,” he said.Police have set up barricades on the Agra-Jaipur national highway No. 21 at Uncha Nagla but many people took the village roads to cross over.“I visited the village link roads touching UP border on Monday and told the villagers to block them. Most of the links have been blocked,” said Garg.“I have directed the police to completely block the movement of people between two states to prevent the spread of Covid-19,” the minister said.This week, three women, who slipped into Bharatpur from Agra, have tested positive. Additional district magistrate (City) Rajesh Goyal said Sapna Devi came from Agra in an ambulance to Bada Mohalla in Bharatpur City to visit her mother, and was quarantined with his son, Krishna, on April 29.

Our judicial conscience compels us to ring the bell else we would fail in discharging our judicial duty or to perform our constitutional function as demanded in the interest of the Nation and the people of Jammu and Kashmir, especially its common woman and man, the poor and the weak,” the bench, also comprising Justice Rajnesh Oswal, said.The court expressed its inability to pass an order, saying it had listed its “limitations on the extent of our jurisdiction whereby we stand precluded from making a declaration on the permissibility or the continuation of the practice...”In its 93-page judgment, the court also listed suggestion made by senior advocate Monika Kohli, who drew the court’s attention to a report that the Centre released around Rs 24 crore for purchase of hardware and software for the civil secretariat and also released funds for digitisation of official records. She submitted before the court that government records should be properly secured and preserved at a proper place.Dogra ruler Maharja Ranbir Singh made the arrangement of shifting the Darbar from Srinagar to Jammu in 1870s to escape severe winter in the Valley and the Jammu heat in the summer. In keeping with the tradition, the capital of Jammu and Kashmir is shifted every six months from Jammu (winter capital) to Srinagar (summer capital).“The discomfort on account of change of weather in either city is today compensated by efficient and modern environment control mechanism as air conditioning, heaters etc in both Jammu as well as Srinagar,” Kohli said.Speaking to HT, Kohli said: “It all started amid the Covid-19 lockdown after a man from Kashmir, whose son was stranded in Iran, moved an application before the court for his evacuation, and it was treated as suo motu PIL.”“While all this was on, the administration announced Darbar Move in April. Some of the lawyers from Kashmir expressed their concern that how Darbar move can happen amid lockdown and Covid infection,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-asks-govt-to-look-into-necessity-of-j-k-s-darbar-move/story-0GGkzLYyyq7QbYdixxiOdP.html
05-05-2020||India||We will bounce back fast: Jimmy Sheirgill||Jimmy Sheirgill says that right now everyone must stay home and be safe. The entertainment industry will take long to restart but once it does, there will be no looking back!“In our profession most things are touch-based. We work in big crews and closely coordinate with each-other and use metal-based equipment a lot. So, it will a lot of time to restart in the post-lockdown era. Right now, people are more focused on being safe! Once things will start, several minds will work and we will bounce back after rescheduling everything,” said the Lucknowite.It has been over 40 days since he stepped out of his house. “It’s a strict lockdown here and I am spending time with my wife, son and father. Fortunately, we have permanent help, who stays with us. So, we are better off,” he said.On how he’s spending time, he said, “Small-small things which we never do in our normal routines, are being taken care of. During the initial days, I finished all scripts for films, web-series and followed a good home-gym routine. But, after a few days, you start finding new activities. Now, I manage to do something new, organising something or rearranging stuff. I can say that I have become a more organised person during this period.”Looking at the positive sides of it, he said, “A lot of good too has happened in this period. Our air and water quality has improved. In Mumbai, we are breathing such good air. I saw pictures of crystal clean Ganga at Rishikesh-Haridwar. We are spending quality time with the family. There is no point looking at it through a negative lens.”Sheirgill was shooting for the sequel of his regional film ‘Shareek’ (means enmity) in Punjab, when the lockdown started. “In Punjab, strictness and curfew started a bit early, so we left on March 19. Once things re-start, we will first complete this film as we have to be in a look — beard and ‘pagdi’ (turban).”Last to come on OTT platform was ‘Rangbaaz Phirse’ in December. “Officially, I can just say that Shareek-2 will be released. Otherwise, projects are there which will come but till their official announcements come I can’t talk about it. As actors, we keep doing our work, which, with God’s grace, is going well!”He feels that the digital space, already in a good space, has boomed during the lockdown. “Its reach has become bigger and wider. Old content is being consumed.” He has also produced a few films. “No, right now I am not doing anything. I did produce four Punjabi films but not anymore. It’s a full-time job; you may be acting somewhere and a film is being shot elsewhere. However, I have made it a point to do a Punjabi film every year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/we-will-bounce-back-fast-jimmy-sheirgill/story-UGEJURE2muK2EtxqcySARJ.html

I am looking at things from my nephew’s point of view as they live in a fantasy world. Probably, that is why I don’t feel anxiety like many other are facing in this period,” says the Lucknowite.She was at her sister’s house when the lockdown started. “I preferred to stay back as she has a kid so I can help her and together we can look after things which we divided between ourselves,” said Aahana over the phone.Fond of nazms (poetries) she has started learning them for quite some time now. She has singled out Jaun Elia’s work which she plans to recite on social media. “There have been plentiful exercising and cooking videos making a round on social media during the lockdown. So I thought to try something different and decided to make a nazm recital video.”For Aahana cooking is last in her list, she shares. “After a point, due to hectic shoot schedules ‘sab adate choot jati hai.’ My focus switched to workouts, shooting schedules and scripts. But now, I got time for things I was missing out like writing, watching shows and films.”The ‘Lipstick Under My Burkha’ actor had couple of releases lined up during this period. “A month back my series ‘Marzi’ (with Rajeev Khandelwal) released. Then hosted a sports series, ‘Colour Me Blue’ focused on lives of Indian cricketers like Smriti Mandhana, Harmpreet Kaur and Jhulan Goswami. The series delightfully showcased the other side of the female sports stars. Next to release is horror series ‘Betaal’ with Viineet Kumar (Mukkabaaz fame).”Her film ‘Khuda Hafiz’ was scheduled to release in summers. “As of now no one has any idea when work will resume and releasing of films will start. I enjoyed playing an Arab cop, sporting a hijab and performing action sequences in Uzbekistan.” A part of the film was also shot in Lucknow with Vidyut Jamwal.There were projects that were to start but have been deferred due to coronavirus spread. “Entertainment is something everyone wants but for government the priority is and will be safety, healthcare and essential services and rightly so! It will be interesting to see how things will start. It’s our ‘rozi-roti’ so we too want go back to work soon but the real struggle is for the numerous crew members to make ends meet in such times.”She hopes to go back to her home in Andheri. “It’s a hotspot and my parents are living there.

05-05-2020||India||India’s unemployment rate soars to 27.11% amid Covid-19 crisis: CMIE||The Covid-19 crisis has led to a spike in the country’s unemployment rate to 27.11 per cent for the week ended May 3, up from the under 7 per cent level before the start of the pandemic in mid-March, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) has said. The Mumbai-based think tank said the rate of unemployment was the highest in the urban areas, which constitute the most number of the red zones due to the Covid-19 cases, at 29.22 per cent, as against 26.69 per cent for the rural areas. Analysts have been warning about the spectre of unemployment ever since the country was put under a lockdown on March 25 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to arrest the spread of the virus infections. Scenes of migrants fleeing urban centres like Delhi and Mumbai only confirmed the long-held concerns on their employment as the economic activity came to a grinding halt. The government has so far announced income and food support to the vulnerable people as part of a Rs 1.70 lakh crore fiscal stimulus to the economic, financial and possibly humanitarian crisis, and is also mulling a second round of measures soon. The US has seen a huge spike in unemployment as over 26 million people have claimed for state support because of losing their jobs. Experts often rue the absence of a good gauge of jobs in India, which is predominantly an unorganised-sector led economy. CMIE’s weekly series of data pointed to a steady increase in unemployment since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in India, with the week to March 29 showing the sharpest spike to 23.81 per cent. As per CMIE’s data, the monthly unemployment rate in April stood at 23.52 per cent, up from March’s 8.74 per cent. As of the end of April, Puducherry in South India had the highest number of unemployment at 75.8 per cent, followed by neighbouring Tamil Nadu 49.8 per cent, Jharkhand 47.1 per cent and Bihar 46.6 per cent. Maharashtra’s unemployment rate was pegged at 20.9 per cent by the CMIE, while the same for Haryana stood at 43.2 per cent, Uttar Pradesh at 21.5 per cent and Karnataka at 29.8 per cent. Hilly states had the lowest incidence of unemployment as of April, the think tank said, pointing out that the rate in Himachal Pradesh stood at 2.2 per cent, Sikkim at 2.3 per cent and Uttarakhand at 6.5 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-unemployment-rate-soars-to-27-11-amid-covid-19-crisis-cmie/story-9FOWBKTj3F3HlczvZJAtZN.html

The government had brought the ordinance on April 30 after a single bench of the High Court had annulled its order to cut salaries of employees.While hearing a bunch of petitions questioning the ordinance, the government said it was not a salary cut but a temporary deferment of payment to tide over the crisis. It reiterated that this amount will be paid once the fiscal condition of the state improves.“It is an extra ordinary situation and the court cannot question the wisdom of the legislature in bringing out an ordinance, especially, when the ordinance does not partake of a character appropriating the salary but deferring it for the time being, that too under the authority of law,” it observed.The government has lauded the order. “We are happy. As the court pointed out, it is an extraordinary situation. Instead of a united stance, some people are instigating employees,” said finance minister T M Thomas Iaasc. The state is expected to collect Rs 2000 crore through this move. But employees’ organisations owing allegiance to the opposition parties said they will move the Supreme Court soon.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Last month the government had issued an order to cut a month’s salary in five instalments and said the move will be applicable to employees of all state-owned enterprises, public sector undertakings, quasi-government organisations and universities, among others. But later, its order was stayed by the High Court and the government was forced to take the ordinance route. The ordinance, however, left the salaries of employees of court and judicial services out of its purview.For Coronavirus Live Updates||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-refuses-to-stay-ordinance-on-salary-cut/story-3vlVnarubV6PVJthM4PC6O.html

In such circumstances, the samples need to be sent to the closest approved institute, and this has been conveyed to the forest department,” said Dr. A P Somkuwar, associate dean, NVC.The college aims to get an approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to be designated as an approved institute for further animal testing in Maharashtra.HT reported on Monday that swab samples of the female cub, rescued from paddy fields in Mul taluka of Chandrapur district, were collected on April 28 by the forest department after concerns of improper protective equipment during the rescue and initial ill health of the cub. The samples were sent to NVC for testing on May 1. The test results were expected on Tuesday. The cub is currently being kept at a transit treatment centre in Chandrapur and is healthy, forest officials said.NVC’s last minute decision not to test the samples left the forest department in a lurch. “If this was the case, the college could have informed us much earlier. During the lockdown, it is difficult to get permissions and interstate transportation. However, the process will begin immediately,” said A L Sonkusare, divisional forest officer (territorial), Chandrapur.Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra said, “Following NVC’s decision we have decided to send the swab samples to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal. We are working on the permissions for interstate transport. Once all permissions are in place, the samples will be sent.”The cub will not be reunited with its mother until its samples are tested.“In the meantime, the cub will remain in the transit treatment centre at Chandrapur, and efforts to reunite her with her mother are put on hold till we get the results.” Kakodkar said.Sonskusare said arrangements were being made to send the samples to Bhopal since it is the closest.After the first confirmed case of a tiger testing positive for Covid-19 in New York was reported on April 5, the Centre approved three institutes were approved Covid-19 animal testing - National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, National Research Centre on Equines in Hisar, Haryana, and Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagpur-veterinary-college-returns-tiger-cub-s-samples-without-covid-19-testdline/story-XsPWWdCVfMZloNW4DWJEuI.html

The passengers will be charged for the flights, said Puri, adding it is a commercial service being carried out under “special circumstances”. The minister said the exchequer does not have the space to pay for repatriation of more than 2,00,000 estimated stranded Indians. Some of the fares (one way) from the Gulf countries such as Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Doha to Kochi, Kerala range from Rs 15,000 to Rs 16,000. Rescue flights from London to India will cost Rs 50,000 while flights from the United States to India have been priced at Rs 1,00,000. “If there was no charge, people wanting to come back would be much higher,” said the minister.The first phase of the evacuation will begin from May 7 to May 13, evacuating Indians from 12 countries: the UEA, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Bangladesh, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, United Kingdom and the United States, according to the first week’s flight plan reviewed by Hindustan Times. India will be evacuating 2,100 citizens from the United States and 2,000 from the UAE in the first week. For now, only Air India flights - 40 from the national carrier and 24 from its subsidiary Air India express - will be deployed.“We will consider involving private airlines as well going forward,” Puri said. The government on Monday announced it will begin repatriating Indians stranded around the world because of the Covid-19 crisis in phases from May 7 as a sign of relief for hundreds of thousands of Indian’s stranded abroad since India shut both domestic and international flight operations due to Covid-19.Swati Arora, 32, a Gurugram-based housewife, said her husband has been stranded in Kuala Lumpur Since February. She is due to deliver her baby by May end and has been requesting authorities for over a month seeking relief. “My husband had gone for a work trip and his business Visa which was issued for 28 days had expired on March 20. We have been constantly requesting the MEA and the embassy but got no response. We have also been tweeting about it tirelessly. I want my husband to be back in time for the delivery. The embassy has contacted him and a group of others stranded there informing that they will have to pay for their tickets and also quarantine facilities,” she said.According to Puri, the requests received by the Indian embassies are increasing by the day and expected to go much higher than the initial estimate. “Initially, we had estimated 190,000-200,000 stranded Indians wishing to come back. As the MEA and state governments considered the number, many more expressed an interest to travel. A comprehensive plan has been drawn out only for those of our citizens who are in foreign countries and who are stranded either because their visas have expired or they are being deported or they went to these countries just before the lockdown for work and need to get back,” Puri said. “We are looking at a possible second wave of infections and we need to take the screening and quarantine process very seriously,” he added. A standard operating protocol (SOP) has been prepared for the repatriation, the government has said. Upon arrival passengers will have to fill a self-declaration form. Medical screening of passengers would be done before they take the flight and only asymptomatic passengers would be allowed to travel. During the journey, all these passengers would have to follow the protocols, such as the health protocols, issued by the ministry of health and the ministry of civil aviation. On reaching their destination in India, travellers will have to register on the Aarogya Setu app and undergo another medical screening. After scrutiny, they will be quarantined for 14 days, either in a hospital or in an institutional quarantine on payment-basis, by the concerned state government. “All the necessary protocols, including thermal screening, social distancing, etc, will have to be followed. State governments have to assure us that they have the necessary infrastructure to handle the passengers coming in. They will have to have adequate quarantine facilities including provisions for paid quarantine,” Puri said. India has suspended its domestic and International passenger flights till May 17, there is no clear indication yet from the government on when they may resume. “Decision on domestic and international flight operations still remain to be taken. The services will continue to remain suspended. We will have to do it in a graded manner initially. It is not possible to open the skies at once. We will have to work out a plan by watching the behaviour of the virus and our capacity to deal with operations on ground,” he said.The government has also kept at least a dozen Indian Navy ships and around 30 Indian Air Force aircraft on standby for the mammoth rescue operation as the Centre expects the numbers to increase. Among the key routes proposed in the first week, 15 flights from seven countries are expected to ferry more than 3,150 passengers to Kerala. At least 150,000 Indians have registered to return with the Indian missions in the UAE alone, with almost a quarter of them citing job losses as the reason for returning home. Eleven flights are scheduled for Delhi with more than 3,100 passengers, 11 for Tamil Nadu with nearly 2150 passengers. Flights are also scheduled for states, say, Maharashtra, Telangana, Gujarat, Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mega-evacuation-of-indians-abroad-begins-thursday-us-passengers-to-pay-rs-1-lakh/story-2ZTaH6cbgepDGKYyMTnA8J.html
05-05-2020||India||‘Govt without a heart’: Shivakumar stings Yediyurappa on Covid-19 response||In what is being seen as an astute political move by Congress, offering to pay fare of the migrants travelling across the country back to their native states, part of the credit should go to its Karnataka unit which made this initial offer to the state government locally on Saturday. And subsequently to DK Shivkumar, the party’s state chief. Ever since Shivakumar, the party’s key trouble-shooter took over as the President of the Karnataka unit in March this year, Congress has been on an overdrive to put the BJP-led state government on the mat.In an exclusive chat with Hindustan Times, Shivakumar has strongly criticised the handling of the situation India is faced with due to the pandemic. The senior Congress leader has also accused the state government of lacking compassion when dealing with the poor. Edited excerpts :Q: Karnataka unit of Congress was the first to make an offer to pay the government on behalf of the migrants so that they could travel back to their states. Now, this has been echoed by party’s national leadership, spotlighting the BJP-led government. Where did this idea originate?DKS: Yes, it was the Congress in Karnataka which came forward to help the poor. Already, these poor migrants who had come here in search of livelihoods, are without any salary for more than a month. Only a heartless government will insist that they pay for their journey back home when they are struggling to feed themselves and their families.When we saw the situation on ground and conveyed it to our leadership, both Sonia ji and Rahul ji fully backed and blessed this idea. It has their full backing. We collected funds from party workers, legislators and from basically anyone who was willing to contribute to help these poor migrants. To help these migrants, we issued a cheque of Rupees one crore to the MD of Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation.Q : Karnataka revenue minister R Ashoka has dubbed the cheque as fake, as it is signed by former KPCC President Dinesh Gundu Rao and not by you. Additionally, deputy CM Lakshman Savadi has claimed this entire move is just a ‘drama’.DKS: It is politically immature of Ashoka to call the cheque fake. The cheque has been issued on behalf of KPCC and signed by my predecessor as I haven’t had the time to take on that responsibility as banks have been shut due to the current crisis.As far as Savadi’s statement, they can call it anything. Those who are suffering know the truth. As a responsible Opposition, we are trying to do everything possible to help the poor and needy. We are highlighting issues which needs to be brought to the attention of people.Q: Even BJP national secretary B L Santhosh has tweeted that ‘Let alone charging, railways don’t have ticket counters...Trains are run on state requests. After the request Kerala, Rajasthan, Maharastra make #migrantlabourers pay & INCIndia chief issues statement and usual suspects pump it up’. Your comments on this?DKS: I have huge respect for Santhosh ji who is a national leader from my state. However, he doesn’t seem to have full facts. Let him please go and check whether money was collected from migrants who were ferried by more than 100 buses of KSRTC. If money was not collected, why did KSRTC deposit it with the government saying passenger fare from more than 3500 people. One should comment only after knowing full facts. I even met the MD of KSRTC and gave him the Congress party cheque. Now he says, please donate it to the CM fund.Q: Karnataka government has been claiming that compared to most large states it has done well with minimum number of deaths and positive cases as well as on relief and rehabilitation measures?DKS: Please go and tell that to the farmers who are destroying crops because they have no buyers and the government is doing nothing to help them. Because of the fight between Sriramulu (health and family welfare minister) and Sudhakar (medical education minister), Suresh Kumar (primary and secondary education minister) is addressing daily briefings on the coronavirus pandemic. This is the level of co-ordination they have in the face of a crisis.One deputy CM announces IT-BT will work with 50 per cent workforce and then the CM contradicts him, saying it will work with only 33 per cent work force. There is absolutely no co-ordination within the government. There performance on all fronts have been poor. This government does not seem to be able to see the poor and deprived and it does not hear their cries. This government doesn’t have eyes, ears and above all no heart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-without-a-heart-shivakumar-stings-yediyurappa-on-covid-19-response/story-SrpeShN4Od7QPR1GzBnJRK.html

Prices are likely to skyrocket after the mandi shut down over the Covid-19 scare,” she said. Her apprehension was not unfounded. She lives in the town’s Ganga Nagar locality, where over a dozen vendors sell vegetables and fruits daily. But on Tuesday, only two vendors went around selling vegetables and fruits, and that, too, at prices 30% higher than Monday, when 24 new Covid-19 positive cases came to light.A vendor pleaded helplessness about the overnight spike in vegetable prices. “The district authorities have cancelled our passes. Fortunately, only two of us managed to get some vegetables and fruits for our daily customers,” he said.Narendra Singh, the state government-appointed secretary entrusted to run Naveen Mandi, which has emerged as Meerut’s epicentre of Covid-19 positive cases, said scared traders refused to open their shops on Tuesday.“The district authorities are searching for two-three alternate locations for the mandi to function for at least the next three days, while an intense sanitisation drive will be launched to clean the market premises,” he added.“Passes issued to traders and vendors stand cancelled and fresh ones will be issued after the mandi is temporarily shifted to the new locations. The district authorities are looking at the makeshift locations from where fruits and vegetables can be sold in a bid to ensure that social distancing norms can be strictly enforced,” Singh said. Meerut city magistrate Satyendra Kumar Singh admitted that maintaining an uninterrupted supply of fruits and vegetables amid the pandemic poses a massive challenge for the district administration. Vegetables and fruits are essential commodities. We’re trying our best to ensure that the supply chain is not disrupted,” he said.Ashok Sonkar, president of Naveen Mandi Vegetable Traders’ Association, is under home quarantine after a person, who works in a shop adjacent to his, tested Covid-19 positive on Monday.“This is an unprecedented situation. Traders are running scared. Farmers are destroying vegetables on their farms. Everyone, including the state government, is suffering massive losses because of this viral outbreak,” said Sonkar.He, too, demanded an intense sanitisation drive in the mandi and urged traders to come up with a plan in tandem with the district administration to ensure that there is no disruption in the supply of fruits and vegetables in the town.Sarfaraj Ansari, secretary of Naveen Mandi Vegetable Traders’ Association, said that over 150 wholesale traders operate out of the mandi, and up to 4,000 cater to different parts of Meerut. The mandi’s daily supply is estimated to be a truckload of potato, onion, and tomato each and around 4,000 quintals of green vegetables, he said.The district health officials found that 24 people from the mandi were Covid-19 positive after they conducted the pool test in per the Uttar Pradesh government’s bid to carry out aggressive testing to flatten the curve.But Monday’s detection of 24 new Covid-19 cases has caused alarm among many customers in Meerut.“I’m using a bucket while buying vegetables and fruits from a vendor and then washing them extensively. This is the least I can do to ensure my family members don’t contract the viral infection. Vegetables and fruits pass through several hands before they reach the end-user and can be potential carriers of SARS-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19,” said Mithilesh, a customer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-24-test-positive-at-meerut-s-vegetable-market-panic-grips-vendors-and-buyers/story-GNfpZalFiFETnXtXczeqUM.html

05-05-2020||India||Lockdown 3.0: Andhra increases liquor prices by another 50%||Admitting that the reopening of liquor shops on Monday led to a chaotic situation, the Andhra Pradesh government on Tuesday increased liquor prices by another 50% with immediate effect, taking the overall increase in the retail prices of liquor to 75% in the last two days.On Monday, the first day of resumption of retail liquor sale, the state government increased the liquor prices by 25% by imposing an additional retail excise tax on all brands of liquor.“The steep hike in liquor prices is to discourage the consumption of alcohol by the people, as part of implementing prohibition in the state in a phased manner and preventing heavy rush at liquor outlets,” special chief secretary (excise) Rajath Bhargava said.An official release from the chief minister’s office said apart from an additional hike of 50%, in addition to the 25% increase of rates in liquor prices, the number of shops would also be slashed by 15% by end of May.At present, there are 3,468 retail outlets in the state. Of them, just around 500 located in containment areas and inside malls are closed. All these outlets are being run by the state excise department.The official release admitted that hours after the shops opened on Monday, thousands of people turned up in long queues without following social distancing guidelines.“Controlling the public has become a herculean task amidst the spread of Covid-19. In order to discourage people from consuming liquor, the government increased the prices by 75% on the lines of Delhi government, which hiked the prices by 70%,” it said.The state government also decided to open liquor outlets from 11am till 8pm.Reviewing the situation at an official meeting, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy instructed that the police department take an active charge in controlling the flow of liquor from other states and illicit liquor.The reopening of liquor shops on Monday, in tune with the central government guidelines last week relaxing lockdown norms in green and orange zone districts and non-containment areas of red zones, drew large crowds on Monday. There were, however, protests from women in parts of Nellore and Visakhapatnam districts.“On the first day, the state earned around Rs 68 crore through liquor sales. On the second day, it is expected to be more as the prices have been increased further and the duration of the shop has been extended by an hour — up to 8pm, instead of 7pm,” a senior official in the excise department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-3-0-andhra-increases-liquor-prices-by-another-50/story-0sHvXASAWKHvaACSXrd2eK.html

Subsequently, personnel may have contracted the infection during law and order duties in different parts of Delhi along with the Delhi Police,” said an official who did not want to be named. Out of these, 43 personnel were those deployed for internal security duties in the national capital while two were deployed for law and order duty with the Delhi Police, the ITBP said in a statement.The ITBP reported its first Covid-19 case April 28. On Monday, the number reached 21 before it more than doubled to 45 on Tuesday. “ITBP has started treating the Corona positive personnel at 200 bedded CAPF Referral Hospital based in Greater Noida. This Hospital is now dedicated to corona patients only. Personnel from all Central Armed Police Forces have also been admitted in this Hospital. Currently, 52 have been admitted from the ITBP and BSF (44 from ITBP and 8 from BSF) at the Referral Hospital,” the statement said. The ITBP has also quarantined the remaining 91 personnel of the company at its Chhawla Facility.

The state governments will be responsible for the quarantine facilities.In the first lot of repatriation, beginning May 7, Air India will be conducting all the flights, said the minister, adding that private airlines will be considered going forward.“It is a commercial service being carried out under special circumstances. The exchequer does not have the space to pay for repatriation,” said Hardeep Puri. The minister added that all prescribed health guidelines will be followed while bringing the passengers home.Close to 2 lakh Indians have requested the government to help them come back. Fifteen-hour flights from the US will cost Rs 1 lakh, while flights form the UK will cost Rs 50,000 per passenger.The move likely follows the criticism against the government that it earlier flew Indians stranded abroad home gratis while the migrant labourers were asked to pay for their special train tickets.Congress president Sonia Gandhi stung the Centre when she said her party will pay for the tickets of stranded migrants. Defending itself, the railways said they were charging state governments just 15% of the calculated train fare for the special trains and it was for the states to bear this cost or get the migrant workers to pay.Central government officials have, for days, been telling state governments not to encourage migrant workers to travel. It would not only slow down the economic revival process and make the recovery process longer but also could, as the World Bank had also warned south Asian countries, spread the vector across the region.On Friday, the Centre, however, gave in to pressure from state governments which had been demanding special trains to take the stranded workers home and operated the first train between Telangana and Jharkhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indians-stranded-abroad-to-pay-for-flights-getting-them-home-says-minister/story-h28ULUBnJ2DU2WEJimkdTO.html

This suggests that even those economies that consider restarting may find a paucity of willing participants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-lockdown-indians-japanese-most-nervous-about-reopening/story-1oo2m6OW360VY4w1dtScFI.html

On Monday, the liquor shops were allowed to open after more than a month in the green and orange zones, along with areas outside containment zones and hotspots in the red zone districts.The shops were open from 7 am to 4 pm as part of relaxations in the lockdown 3.0. Long queues of customers were witnessed outside the shops with police force deployed to maintain order and ensure social distancing. Confirming the development, cabinet minister and government spokesperson Madan Kaushik said, “Yes, the state government is planning to levy Covid cess on liquor like other states are planning.”He, however, refused to put a number on the cess percentage that is to be levied. Kaushik said, “It will be discussed in the cabinet meeting of the state government in detail, likely on Wednesday.”A government official privy to the development said the move was important to avoid long queues at the shops.“The move will ensure that there is no chaos or long queues at the liquor shops which may pose a danger to public health amid this ongoing pandemic,” said the above mentioned official who did not wish to be named. “Apart from this it will also somewhat compensate the revenue loss to the state exchequer due to the closure of liquor shops for more than one month as excise is one of the major source of revenue for the government,” the official added.Cabinet minister Kaushik, however, refused to reveal the reasons behind the move. “All aspects will be discussed in the cabinet meeting. At present, the priority of the government is to ensure that the precautionary measures are being implemented in the market and public places which have reopened under relaxations to contain the infection of Covid-19,” said Kaushik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-plans-to-levy-covid-cess-on-liquor-says-state-minister/story-peem6bQR7ekrRgAkdipUCP.html

The clampdown was so hard in the initial days that it became difficult for journalists to even move or send their works to their organizations.The AP said that the three photojournalists, snaking around roadblocks, sometimes took cover in strangers’ homes and hid cameras in vegetable bags. They captured images of protests, police and paramilitary action and daily life - and then headed to an airport to persuade travellers to carry the photo files in memory cards and flash drives out with them and get them to the agency’s office in New Delhi.

Police are waiting for the woman’s autopsy report. Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south), said the woman, whose identity is yet to be ascertained, appeared to be in her early thirties.“Her body was in the front passenger seat of a Maruti Ritz car that was found abandoned near Fourth Avenue Road. She has a head injury. The nature of the injury can be confirmed only when we have her autopsy report,” said Thakur.A case of murder was registered at Lodhi Colony police station and multiple teams have been formed to probe the case. “Our first priority is to identify the woman and the ownership of the car. We are also scanning the footage of CCTV cameras installed on routes leading to the spot where the car with the body inside was parked,” said a police officer associated with the probe.This is the third murder case reported in Delhi between Monday and Tuesday morning even as a majority of the police personnel remain on streets enforcing the lockdown rules.On Monday morning, the body of a 23-year-old woman was found in a locked factory in outer Delhi’s Narela industrial area. The police are looking for her friend, who was last seen with her in the factory on Sunday and has been missing since the murder came to light.In another case, a 17-year-old face mask manufacturer was stabbed to death in southeast Delhi’s Tughlaqabad Extension after a heated argument over providing cheaper masks to sellers turned nasty on Monday.

05-05-2020||India||Lockdown 3.0: Long queues outside liquor stores lead to revenue boost for states||Tuesday, the second day of lockdown 3.0 across India was no different from day one in one aspect: long queues continued outside liquor stores in different parts of the country.One of the relaxations in lockdown curbs after 40 days to reboot the economy was allowing opening of licenced liquor shops in many states including Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka and Delhi. The permission, however, didn’t apply to containment areas.While this proved to be a headache for the law enforcement agencies as cops tried to enforce social distancing norms outside liquor shops, the states themselves appear to have gained by it in terms of revenues. Liquor sale is a big source of revenue for the governments.Uttar Pradesh registered sale of over Rs 100 crore from the sale of liquor on Monday, reports news agency IANS.State excise department officials said that in state capital Lucknow alone, liquor worth Rs 6.3 crore was recorded.“I don’t think there would be any single industry with just less than one lakh work force that gives Rs 100 crore revenue (to the state exchequer) in a day, “ Principal Secretary, Excise, Sanjay Bhoosreddy was quoted as saying by IANS. The average daily sale of liquor in the state in normal times is around Rs 70-80 crore.Karnataka, too, saw sale of liquor valued at Rs 45 crore on Monday.“As per the tentative figures we received from across the state, around 3.9 lakh litres of beer and 8.5 lakh litres of the Indian-made liquor (IML) were sold, netting Rs 45 crore when the liquor shops were shut by 7 p.m., as per the new guidelines,” an excise official told IANS in Bengaluru.Buoyed by the surge in liquor sale on day one itself, the Karnataka government decided to hike the prices of all brands when new stocks arrive next week, state excise minister H Nagesh said on Monday.“All liquor brands will cost more from next week when new stocks arrive for sales, as the 6 per cent increase in additional excise duty will be added to their maximum retail price,” Nagesh told reporters, reports IANS.Hike in liquor pricesDelhi and Andhra Pradesh, too, have decided to hike liquor prices. Andhra Pradesh on Tuesday hiked the prices of liquor by 50% , a day after imposing a 25% increase. This takes the overall hike in liquor price in the southern state to 75%. The revised rates came into effect from Tuesday itself. The hike has been imposed to discourage alcohol consumption, according to the chief minister’s office, reports ANI.Sources said the fresh hike (50 per cent) in rates could fetch an additional revenue of Rs 9,000 crore per annum to the cash-starved state government, according to PTI.‘Special Corona Fee’The Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government late on Monday imposed a “special corona fee” of 70% of the MRP on all categories of liquor that will be sold in the city with effect from Tuesday.The fee would apply at “70% of the maximum retail price of all categories of liquor sold through written licences for consumption off the premises,” read a government order.Senior government officials said that the lockdown since March 25 to prevent the spread of Covid-19 cost the Delhi government around Rs 645 crore in revenue from the sale of alcohol, when calculated on the basis of revised estimates in the 2019-20 state budget.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-3-0-long-queues-outside-liquor-store-lead-to-revenue-boost-for-states/story-Q8gdcW5yCuhZvpeHs4hiTM.html

It further said that migrant workers are complaining that this is Rs 200 higher than the normal ticket price.A train is expected to leave Alappuzha to on Tuesday afternoon to Hazaribag in Bihar with 1,140 migrants.The migrant labourers, meanwhile, said that it is cruel on part of the Kerala government to reject the offer made by the Congress party.Congress president Sonia Gandhi had on Monday attacked the government for charging train tickets from migrant labourers going back to their homes and announced that her party will bear the cost for the rail travel of all such workers stranded due to the coronavirus lockdown.In a statement, she had said that it is disturbing that the central government and the rail ministry are charging them for train tickets in this hour of crisis.Gandhi said the Congress has taken a decision that all its state units will bear the cost for the rail travel of every needy worker and migrant labourer and take necessary steps in this regard.Terming the party decision as “historic”, Venugopal and Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala had said that the party’s state units will pay the cost of train travel of migrants to state chief secretaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-govt-refuses-money-from-congress-for-migrants-travel-party-says-shed-false-pride/story-s6MB16OHuUd7STkb62Tq9H.html

The aviation and travel industry experts said the higher rates couldn’t be avoided because social distancing norms would limit the number of passengers on each flight.Indian ambassador Pavan Kapoor told the daily that the missions in the UAE had “prioritised the list of passengers and given it to Air India”. He added, “We would call and email each passenger to contact Air India to get their tickets issued. The first two flights on Thursday would be to Kerala, considering the high number of applicants from the state.”One of the three Indian Navy ships that set off on Monday night to evacuate stranded Indians – INS Shardul – will go to Dubai to bring back expatriates, the defence ministry said. The other two warships – INS Jalashwa and INS Magar – were sent to the Maldives. All three warships will return to Kochi.Kapoor also said there would be flights almost on a daily basis to various destinations in India. Other officials said Indians stranded in the UAE with visit and tourist visas and those with cancelled visas would also be given preference for returning home.The Indian missions in the UAE will convey details of further flights to different destinations in India in the coming days. “We seek patience and cooperation from everyone as the Government of India undertakes this massive task of repatriation of Indian nationals,” the statement said.The UAE is home to more than two million Indian expatriates. Their welfare figured in a telephone conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed on March 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/almost-200-000-indians-register-to-be-repatriated-from-uae/story-40Qw66k1TJVwKqocLY5EsM.html

Only 15% of the total Rs 24 crore was paid for by state governments while the remaining 85% was borne by the Railways, approximately Rs 20 crore, the official added.With a subsequent increase in the number of ‘Shramik special’ trains in the coming days, the ministry is likely to incur thousands of crores on the transportation of migrant labourers to their native places.A fierce political war broke out over the issue of train fare for the migrant workers returning home, with the Congress declaring that the party and its state committees would pay the fare to enable workers to return to their native places.The Union government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed that the railways was bearing 85% of the fare cost, and state governments had to pay 15%, thus allowing migrants to go back home free of cost.On May 1, the first train carrying 1,225 migrant workers was run from the Telangana’s Lingampalli railway station to Hatia in Jharkhand, after the Railway Ministry acceded to the request of the state government for facilitating their return.It was the first special train to be run by the railways to ferry the stranded migrants since its services were suspended due to the coronavirus lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-24-crore-spent-on-migrant-train-tickets-rs-20-crore-borne-by-railways-says-official/story-xzeHOPxmKRKicSPI5PzJdN.html

I am speechless,” reacted Channi Anand, one of the ace photographers of Jammu and Kashmir who, along with Mukhtar Khan and Yasin Dar from Kashmir, was conferred the prestigious award on Monday.They work for Associated Press and won the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for feature photography for their “striking images of life” in Jammu and Kashmir after the Centre abrogated the territory’s special status under Article 370 of the Constitution in August last year.Anand participated in World Press competitions during initial years of his career but then stopped participating because he felt that “Indian lensmen were not recognized for their work at that forum.”However, it is for the first time that photographers from South Asia got this prestigious award, he said.The 50-year-old remained a stringer with the AP for 16 years before taken on board as a staffer four years ago.A go-getter, Anand has covered many terror attacks, Pakistani shelling on the Indo-Pak borders and life in the conflict zone.“I joined AP as a stringer in 1999 and four years back was made staff photo journalist. I started my career from State Times and then moved to Amar Ujala, contributed for ‘The Week’ and ‘India Today’ before switching over to AP,” he said.“It is indeed a moment of pride for me, my family, the people of J&K and especially the media fraternity. I think this award is in recognition of my long struggle of 23 years,” he said.Anand said the award left him speechless. “I was shocked and could not believe it,” he added.Anand informed that he, along with two other colleagues of the AP from Kashmir, had worked on a photo feature on life post- revocation of Article 370 in August last year.The soft-spoken lensman has done his schooling from Shastri Memorial Public School and Ranbir Higher Secondary School before taking online classes in photography.The Pulitzer Prize is considered the most prestigious award in journalism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/moment-of-pride-for-all-of-us-says-ace-j-k-photographer-channi-anand-on-bagging-the-pulitzer-prize/story-5nKRUm5aaR4vluJYMdRQ1H.html

Our experts’ committee is examining it. Further decisions are awaited.”He added that research done in the US and a clinical study in China showed that the drug significantly improved the condition of Covid-19 patients.Also Read: Nearly 15,000 stranded Indians to be evacuated from abroad in first weekA research conducted by the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, showed evidence of a direct anti-viral effect of Interferon Alpha against novel coronavirus in-vitro. The study demonstrated around 10,000 fold reduction in virus titre in cells that were pre-treated with Interferon Alpha 48 hours earlier.Click here for the latest updates from the coronavirus outbreakThe second by a group of universities in China, Australia and Canada retrospectively analysed 77 moderate Covid-19 subjects in Wuhan and observed that those who received Interferon Alpha-2b showed a significant reduction in the duration of virus shedding period and even in levels of the inflammatory cytokine, IL-6.The study suggested that if a long-acting molecule like the drug is given early on in the infection, the patient suffering from Covid 19 will have a significant benefit as the viral load is reduced, lesser IL-6 is produced and virus eliminating specific immune response is generated.It may be noted that Zydus Cadila has been commercially manufacturing Pegylated Interferon Alpha-2b under the brand name, PegiHep, since 2011 for the treatment of Hepatitis B and C. However, PegiHep is not yet licensed or approved for the treatment of Covid-19.The Ahmedabad-based pharmaceutical company is already manufacturing Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) which is being used for asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19, asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases, and Covid-19 patients with severe disease and requiring ICU management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-cadila-seeks-approval-to-use-hepatitis-drug-for-covid-19-clinical-trials/story-LChIMoo7c2OKrbUtfQs1lM.html

And its growing spread has alarmed the state government.Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Monday asked the veterinary and forest departments to draw a broad roadmap to deal with the situation caused by the disease which has killed around 2,500 pigs.He asked officials concerned to conduct ‘threat-mapping’ and undertake containment measures across the state.The government will announce a bailout package after taking stock of the situation to save the farmers from penury, he said.On Sunday, Veterinary Minister Atul Bora had said the disease was detected towards the end of February this year, but it started in April 2019 at a village in Xizang province of China bordering Arunachal Pradesh.“We have decided to not go for culling now. We will create containment zone within 1 km radius of infected area and surveillance zone within 10 km,” he said.According to a 2019 state census, the pig population was 21 lakh, which has increased to around 30 lakh at present, Bora had said.According to the World Organisation for Animal Health, ASF is a severe viral disease affecting both domestic and wild pigs. It can spread by live or dead pigs and pork products.Transmission can also occur via contaminated feed and objects such as shoes, clothes, vehicles, knives and other equipment. Unlike Classical Swine Fever (CSF), there is no vaccine for ASF.While swine flu can spread from animals to humans, swine fever does not, and therefore is not a public health threat.“The National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, has confirmed that it is African Swine Fever (ASF). The central government has informed us that it is the first instance of the disease in the country,” Bora said on Monday.He also visited the Regional Institute of Livestock Entrepreneurship Management (RILEM) and ICAR-National Research Centre on Pig in Rani along with Sonowal.Bora also said that there is no possibility of getting infected by ASF due to consumption of pork and pork products.Usually stray pigs get infected with such viruses, but of late those in the farms have also been found afflicted with the disease.The animal husbandry department initially started administering classical swine flu vaccine but it was stopped due to the scare that the disease could spread through the doctor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/african-swine-fever-after-covid-19-another-disease-from-china-hits-assam-2-500-pigs-dead/story-g8sbTKmZniwouqfX9kK75N.html

05-05-2020||India||Bombay high court refuses to extend central soft loan scheme to private sugar factories in Maharashtra||The Bombay High Court has refused to extend the benefit of soft loan scheme floated by the ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution to private sugar factories in Maharashtra.The division bench of justices SV Gangapurwala and Shrikant Kulkarni dismissed a petition filed by seven private sugar factories from Marathwada region in this regard on Thursday. The petitioners had challenged the validity of March 22, 2018 notification issued by Maharashtra co-operatives department, which is implementing the scheme in the state, keeping the private sugar factories out of the purview of the scheme.The petitioners said that by issuing the notification, the state co-operatives department has restricted benefit of the soft loan scheme only to 29 co-operative sugar factories. For 2014-15 season, when the scheme was floated to ensure payment of fair and remunerative price of sugar cane to farmers, the benefit was extended to a mix of 175 private and co-operative sugar factories in Maharashtra.It was argued on behalf of the petitioner factories that the scheme framed by the central government and implemented by the state government cannot in any way discriminate between co-operative and private sugar factories. The scheme was made applicable uniformly taking into consideration the interest of the agriculturists, but the state government has deprived private sugar factories like the petitioners from getting benefit of the scheme.The high court, however, refused to accept their argument that the state notification was arbitrary and caused injustice to the petitioners factories, which are facing financial crisis because of their exclusion from the scheme.The bench said the state government had initially extended benefit of the scheme to all sugar factories, but it was later restricted to 29 co-operative sugar factories.“If the private sugar factories are left out or excluded from getting benefit of soft loan scheme, it cannot be said to be an arbitrary decision,” said the bench.“The government has a right to take policy decision, particularly wherein financial implications are involved,” the bench said further.“Policy matters are within the domain and competence of the state government and where any policy involves financial and economic ramifications, the court certainly would not transgress upon the policy making power of the state,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-high-court-refuses-to-extend-central-soft-loan-scheme-to-private-sugar-factories-in-maharashtra/story-CxISupRqvNVeqbBExuZAVI.html

The man’s escape had raised fears of possible Covid-19 infection in the area.The man’s escape came even as the number of Covid-19 positive cases zoomed to 170 with the detection of one more case from Ganjam district where around 150 migrant workers fled a quarantine centre on Sunday citing lack of water.Police officials in Jharsuguda said Asid Khan of Kabaristanpada area of Jharsuguda district was kept in a quarantine centre since April 26 as he had visited a containment zone at Nala Road of Rourkela town in neighbouring Sundargarh district.Police had registered a case against Khan under sections 188, 269, 270 and 271 of the IPC at Jharsuguda police station while seeking public help in tracing him out. The man was caught in Badheimunda area of Jharsuguda on Tuesday morning by the police. He has been brought to the quarantine centre. Jharsuguda has reported two coronavirus cases so far.The containment zone in minority-dominated Nala Road area of Rourkela, that Khan visited, has reported 7 positive cases of coronavirus so far including the latest case of a 29-year-old woman. On Monday, an irate mob of the area pelted stones at police personnel and broke barricades around the containment zone causing injuries to four police personnel. Under barricade since April 26, when the first positive case in the area was detected, the residents of Nala Road have refused to cooperate with ASHA workers for health surveillance. The area has over 4,000 households and to assist the local healthcare personnel, additional doctors have been brought from Sambalpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-update-35-year-old-man-flees-quarantine-centre-in-odisha-police-issue-notice-seeking-public-help-in-tracing-him/story-0k7BMLpgSTQI6pyNkjcG3H.html
05-05-2020||India||India should consider a big stimulus to revive Covid-19-hit economy: Abhijit Banerjee||Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee on Tuesday said that India should consider a big stimulus and give cash in hand to create demand and prevent chains of bankruptcies to save the economy hit hard by the nationwide coronavirus lockdown.“India needs a stimulus package. We have not dedicated a large enough financial package yet,” he told former Congress president Rahul Gandhi during a conversation.“Spending is easiest way to revive economy. It will have stimulus effect,” Banerjee added.Gandhi is currently holding a series of conversations with global and Indian thought leaders to discuss the Covid-19 crisis and its consequences on the Indian economy.Banerjee said the government should issue temporary ration cards for three to six months for every person who needs food grains to save their lives. “Use those ration cards for transferring money, wheat and rice to them,” he added.Banerjee, an Indian-American economist, had won the 2019 Nobel Prize in Economics, along with Esther Duflo of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Michael Kremer of Harvard University “for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty”.The three were recognised for their ability to divide the issue of tackling global poverty into smaller subjects.Banerjee told Gandhi that it is important to revive demand. “Nothing bad will happen if we give money to bottom 60%. But to give direct cash transfer to only poorer people is debatable,” he said.On April 30, Gandhi was in dialogue with former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan who suggested that the government transfer cash directly to the poor and supply food through the public distribution system (PDS) to as many people as possible to help them tide over the impact of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and the consequent 40-day lockdown, estimating the effort will cost Rs 65,000 crore.The money is small given that India’s gross domestic product is to the tune of about Rs 200 lakh crore, he had said.Banerjee said the Aadhaar-based claims for PDS would have saved a lot of misery for poor as many of them are still not in the system.“We should take a cue from the US by pumping in more money in the hands of people to revive demand. Also, it is wise to put moratorium on debt payments,” he said.On lifting the lockdown, Banerjee called for caution. “You can’t take out the lockdown when a lot of people are getting sick. We need to be aware of disease’s path before taking a decision on lifting the lockdown,” he added.The Nobel laureate said that India should be optimistic about the overall economic revival post-lockdown.On the centralisation versus decentralisation debate, Banerjee said there is a visible tension as evident from the movement of the migrant workers which could not be handled by state governments only.The central government should have tested the migrant people before they boarded the trains for their home towns, he added.Banerjee also suggested that state government should be given money to chalk out their own schemes aimed at reaching a wider section of the people and not thing about some of that money getting wasted.“Be brave and take risks. When you are in dire straits, being brave is the only option,” he said.Banerjee said the strongman theory has been disastrous in the US and Brazil where the leader are “messing up” right and left.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-should-consider-a-big-stimulus-to-revive-covid-19-hit-economy-abhijit-banerjee/story-kIDYfltl9HzwqNLlttVsuK.html
05-05-2020||India||WII’s Dibang Valley Project report biased and incomplete, says peer review||A peer review of the Wildlife Institute of India’s (WII) report on the Etalin Hydropower Project in Arunachal Pradesh has called it biased. In the 58- page peer review of Dehradun-based institute’s report titled “Wildlife Conservation Plan for Impact Zone of Etalin HEP,” 24 scientists from 14 scientific institutions in India have said that it doesn’t reflect a true picture of the biodiversity of Dibang Valley where the Etalin Hydropower Project of 3097 MW will come up.The review, seen by HT, suggests that WII hasn’t revealed crucial information about the area and impact of the project on ecology and local people.On February 28, 2017 the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) of the environment ministry had met to discuss granting of forest clearance to the project but had recommended a “multiple season replicate study on biodiversity assessment of the catchment area.” The Wildlife Institute of India accordingly produced a technical report last year funded by the Etalin Hydroelectric Power Company at a budget of Rs 170.36 lakhs.Based on WII’s technical report, an FAC sub committee which visited the project area in February this year has approved the project which will involve clearing of at least 2.7 lakh trees in sub-tropical evergreen and rain forests and in a vital tiger area. FAC had again discussed granting forest clearance to the project on April 23 and is likely to publish the minutes of the meeting this week.The 24 scientists who have studied Dibang Valley closely specialise in different areas and include botanists, ornithologists, mammalogists, entomologists, social scientists and others. “Overall, the review encountered considerable deficiencies and scientific biases in the Report which have compromised the quality and the veracity of its findings and conclusions,” the review released late on Monday night said referring to the WII report.While WII was asked to do a multiple season study, it conducted its field observations only between February and June 2018. The peer review said these months do not represent seasonal patterns in Arunachal which has at least three seasons with distinct rainfall and weather regimes: October to February: relatively dry season/winter; March-April: spring/premonsoon; and May to September: summer/monsoon season.Even before the FAC clears the project, WII’s technical report has an entire chapter dedicated to mitigation and conservation measures for the impact of the project. The peer review states that it is not clear on what basis FAC’s singular mandate of biodiversity assessment was converted into a wildlife conservation plan. The WII report doesn’t refer to any peer reviewed scientific papers on social, ecological, physical and geomorphological aspects of the study region instead relies on outdated material the review states.The WII report seems to contradict its own findings at several points. For example, the peer review states that WII has omitted several species in its biodiversity documentation yet collected direct evidence of 230 bird, 159 butterfly, 112 spider, 51 moth, 31 reptile, 14 amphibian and 21 mammal species. At various points, the WII eport states that species and habitat specific conservation plans are not possible due to species diversity and their diverse dietary and foraging patterns, yet recommendations are still made for butterfly parks, reptile parks, and habitat restoration that clearly will not replace the loss of natural habitat, points the review.The Report broadly defines the ‘Zone of Influence’ (ZoI) as the farthest influence of the HEP. But this zone of does not consider areas upstream and downstream of the dams that will be severely altered due to storage of sediments and changes in flow regimes.Based on camera trap exercise WII concludes that there are no tigers in the project area and yet concludes that continuous monitoring of key mammalian fauna including tigers in 10 km radius of the project is crucial. WII also recommends long-term monitoring and conservation efforts are planned particularly for species such as Mishmi Takin (endemic species), Alpine Musk Deer, Red goral, Clouded Leopard, Snow Leopard, Spotted Linsang, in and around the study area.The peer review found that WII has ignored traditional ecological knowledge and the intricacies of nature-human relations of the local people in Dibang Valley completely.The WII report, also seen by HT, recommends a mitigation plan but also states that Arunachal Pradesh has been recognized as one of the 34 global mega biodiversity hotspots It is also a geologically fragile area. It is apparent that the aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity of Arunachal Pradesh is in peril. The proposed hydropower development is likely to impact the habitats and the survival of several endemic and threatened terrestrial species such as the Snow Leopard, Red Panda, Clouded Leopard, Tiger, Arunachal Macaque, Black-necked crane, Mishmi Wren among many others.“These developments will significantly alter the river systems thereby impacting important aquatic species,” it states.Asked about his reaction to the peer review of the WII report, the former director of the institute VB Mathur refused to comment, saying he was no longer associated with the institute.“Our report is in public domain. People are free to interpret it and critique it. I cant respond on behalf of WII because I am no longer with WII,” said Mathur who was the project leader of the 2019 WII report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wii-s-dibang-valley-project-report-biased-and-incomplete-says-peer-review/story-aBGoMWx4civffTI4CqISSL.html

05-05-2020||India||‘Completely surprised, but never obsessed about it’: Abhijit Banerjee on Nobel Prize||Economist Abhijit Banerjee said on Tuesday that he was completely surprised when he got to know that he has been chosen for the Nobel Prize.“There was no premonition, or expectation. I never thought about it, I was completely surprised,” Banerjee said while speaking to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.When asked if he was obsessed about it, Banerjee said, “If you worry about it, you will obsess a lot. And I am good at not obsessing about thing which don’t have any impact on my life.”“I am not saying it was not a big deal, I was saying that you can obsess about it but it’s not like there is a process for it understood by anybody. So, anything can happen,” he added.This was part of the conversation that Gandhi was holding with Banerjee on the economic fall out of the Covid-19 crisis, as part of his series of discussion with experts.They discussed the ways in which this crisis can be managed and other disasters can be averted and also highlighted how the relief measures could be planned better.Gandhi held first such talk with Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan during which the latter said that Rs 65,000 crore is required to help the poor affected by the coronavirus-induced lockdown.He also said that unemployment numbers are really worrying and India needs to be “cleverer” about lifting the lockdown.Banerjee, an Indian-American economist, had won the 2019 Nobel Prize in Economics, along with Esther Duflo of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Michael Kremer of Harvard University “for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty”.He received the Nobel Prize in Economics at a ceremony in Oslo in December last year.Banerjee is only the second Indian to receive the Nobel Prize in economics after Amartya Sen. Born on February 21, 1961, Banerjee was educated at Presidency College, Kolkata, and New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University from where he obtained his master’s degree in economics. He completed his doctoral studies at Harvard in 1988.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/completely-surprised-but-never-obsessed-about-it-abhijit-banerjee-on-nobel-prize/story-cwRIz6JrYAoe9p2bXxkTWM.html
05-05-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Telangana to run 40 trains a day for a week from today to ferry migrant workers||The railways will run 40 special trains form Telangana to various destinations to ferry migrant labourers to their respective native places during the Covid-19 lockdown. The decision has been taken at the request of Telangana government.Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) on Monday night instructed officials to organise travel of migrant labours on behalf of the state government.The trains would run from various stations in Hyderabad, apart from Warangal, Khammam, Damaracharla and other places in the state. They would go to Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, West Bengal and other states, an official release said.“The chief minister spoke to South Central Railway general manager Gajanan Mallya and requested him to arrange for 40 special trains from Tuesday,” the release said.At a meeting on Monday, KCR discussed at length the problems faced by the migrant workers and their growing impatience over the extended lockdown. Thousands of migrant workers from various states have been making attempts to leave for their native place, despite lockdown restrictions.After the Railway authorities operated a one-off special train from Lingampallin on the outskirts of Hyderabad to Hatia in Jharkhand for 1,200 migrant workers last week, demands have been pouring in from other migrant labourers for similar arrangements.The Telangana government appointed senior IAS officer Sandeep Sultania and senior IPS officer Jitendra as special officers to oversee the travel of migrant workers to their native States.“Migrant workers who have already registered their names with the local police stations to leave for their native places, would be allowed to travel by the special trains. The details of the travel will be given at the police stations,” the official release said.KCR appealed to the migrant labourers to not feel anxious as the government had made arrangements for their travel to their native destinations. He instructed the police officers concerned to inform the migrant workers about the travel details and coordinate with them.Meanwhile, the Telangana cabinet will meet on Tuesday to take a call on the extension of lockdown till May 17, as decided by the Centre, or even beyond. It would also discuss on the relaxations given by the Centre to various sectors in the green and orange zones.The health department officials told KCR that most of the Covid-19 positive cases and deaths were more in Hyderabad and its neighbouring three districts of Ranga Reddy, Medchal and Vikarabad and hence there was a need to further tighten and implement lockdown in these districts.So far, the total number of Covid-19 positive cases in Telangana is 1,085 of which 585 persons have been discharged, 29 died and 471 are under treatment. Of the total cases, 717 (66.08 per cent) belong to these four districts and among those dead, 82.21 per cent belongs to these four districts. For the past 10 days, the highest number of cases reported from these districts only, officials said.The officials requested the chief minister to not give any relaxations in these districts. “Continue lockdown as it is, if need be, more strictly,” they said.They said the cases in other districts have decreased and the number of containment zones has also been reduced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-telangana-to-run-40-trains-a-day-for-a-week-from-today-to-ferry-migrant-workers/story-OBBoMJppMw4DtegfCNGJyL.html

We will ensure adherence to all guidelines and health safety measures while building the chariots at ‘Rahta Khala’ (the open area on either side of the Grand Road in Puri),” said Puri king Gajapati Dibyasinghdev, who heads the managing committee of the 12th century temple.The Rath Yatra, scheduled on June 23, is the most important festival in Odisha attended by over million devotees who throng Puri town for the 10-day long festival. The temple doors have been shut since March 20 due to the pandemic. Only day-to-day rituals are being done by the temple priests.The temple managing committee, which met on Monday via videoconferencing, decided that if the lockdown is further extended and Rath Yatra cancelled, the logs of the chariots can be taken apart and used in the temple kitchen for preparation of the Mahaprasad.“The committee will decide on whether or not to hold Rath Yatra once the restrictions are lifted on May 17. A decision on Snana Yatra of the lords (when the three deities are bathed) will also be taken in the next meeting,” Dibyasinghdev said.If the car festival is not held this year, it would be the first time in the last 284 years when it could not be held. In the 425 years of the car festival, the event has been scrapped 32 times, mostly during invasion. It was scrapped for the first time in 1568 when Kala Pahad alias Kala Chand Roy, a general of Bengal king Suleiman Kirrani attacked the temple and pillaged the deities. The last time it could not be held was between 1733 and 1735 when Mohammed Taqi Khan, deputy governor of Odisha, attacked the Jagannath temple, forcing the shifting of the idols to Ganjam district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puri-rath-yatra-chariots-construction-to-begin-amid-lockdown/story-kwXu8OhNE1Kl5s3Gp1G43I.html

Wearing his uniform, the officer was seen standing in a queue with a nylon bag in his hands outside a liquor store in Berhampore in Murshidabad district in a video widely shared on social media.The incident took place around 4.30 pm in the Haridasmati area.The identity of the police officer, who was wearing the uniform of a sub-inspector, could not be ascertained as he had a helmet on that covered his face Some buyers alleged that the man tried to break the line, violating social distancing norms. When some local people and journalists asked him to reveal his identity, the man quickly rode off on a motorcycle.The police officer was present outside the shop for around 10 minutes during which time he was caught on camera by some of the people, including journalists, and the video was later widely shared.The owner of the shop, who did not want to be identified, said, “I opened the shop after 4.30 pm as the state excise department order was issued late in the day. I did not see who all were standing in the queue.”The superintendent of police (SP) Murshidabad police district, Sabari Rajkumar, said, “I am not aware of the incident.”Another senior officer who did not want to be identified said, “It is not desirable that a police officer in uniform should be seen buying liquor. We have seen the photos circulating on social media.

In West Bengal, the figures were 8,335, 8,178 and 8,205 for the corresponding years.Amit Sarkar, general secretary, Darjeeling District Legal Aid Forum (DDLAF) said, “The Covid-19 outbreak has stopped rescue operations conducted by different agencies. We are especially concerned about the missing children from Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar districts.”Sarkar said, “Though the number of missing children is much higher, around 100 missing diaries were lodged in different police stations after 2018. The effort to trace some of them were on when the lockdown was declared.”On April 27, DDLAF wrote to the National Legal Services Authority (NLSA) and demanded formation of a ‘Special Combat Team’.Sarkar said, “Though the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Children (WBCPC) has taken cognizance of a complaint lodged by DDLAF the state machinery moves slowly.” “The lockdown has also affected the income of local people. Hence, families of most of the missing children are not being able to pursue these cases,” said Sarkar.Rangu Souriya, secretary of Kanchanjunga Uddhar Kendra (KUK), which has rescued more than a thousand girls and women, said, “Preparing strategies to prevent trafficking and tracing the missing children during the lockdown is a must.”Raju Nepali, founder of Dooars Express Mail, an NGO that rescues trafficked children, said, “There is not a single police station in Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar districts where complaints have not been lodged. Most of the children come from poor families. Many cases are never reported.”Rabindranath Ghosh, senior Trinamool Congress leader and north Bengal affairs minister, said, “The NGOs have given a good proposal. Efforts should be made to trace the missing children.”The NGOs also fear that the missing children may contract the infection as their abductors may not be exercising social distancing norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-ngos-want-centre-s-help-in-tackling-trafficking-during-covid-19-lockdown/story-kyYElBHaOhhcnq9DZmFsQP.html

The fresh record for new cases came on the day India eased lockdown rules and allowed the resumption of several activities. With liquor shops reopening, thousands across the country lined up outside such stores, triggering chaos and flouting social-distancing rules.Bustle, chaos as Lockdown 3.0 beginsA degree of chaos and confusion prevailed on the first day of India’s lockdown 3.0 — this is the third extension of the national lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, but with substantial relaxations in restrictions — with several citizens violating social distancing norms and authorities struggling to enforce a complex set of regulations across the country on Monday.Read MoreRow over migrants’ rail fare as Congress offers to foot the bill A fierce political war broke out over the issue of train fare for the migrant workers returning home, with the Congress declaring that the party and its state committees would pay the fare to enable workers to return and accusing the Centre of being insensitive to their plight. The Union government and the BJP said that the railways was bearing 85% of the fare cost, and state governments had to pay 15%, thus allowing migrants to go back home free of cost.Read MoreWith 3,861 new cases, Covid-19 count crosses 46,000-markThe number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in India grew by 3,861 on Monday, a fresh record for new cases that pushed the nationwide tally of confirmed infections across the country to over 46,000.

The third phase of lockdown began on Monday and will continue until May 17 with some relaxations. Opening of liquor shops was one of them.Here’s all about the “special corona fee”:* In accordance with the latest lockdown relaxations given by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA), about 150 government-run liquor shops have been allowed to open from 9am to 6.30pm in Delhi.* The Delhi government’s finance department issued the order late on Monday night.* “70 per cent of the maximum retail price on all categories of liquor sold through retail licensees for consumption off the premises,” the finance department’s order signed by the deputy secretary reads.* “It will be 70% of the MRP (maximum retail price). The new rates will be imposed from Tuesday morning,” the government said in the statement.* So if a liquor bottle with a pre-tax MRP costs Rs 1000, you will now have to pay Rs 1700.* Officials have said the “special corona tax” will help in boosting the revenue, badly hit due to the Covid-19 lockdown.* Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said on Sunday that the government is finding it difficult to pay the salaries due to revenue loss of Rs 3200 crore in April as compared to the previous year.* It can be one of the ways the Delhi government can earn more revenue from liquor sales with lockdown hitting businesses and tax collection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/want-booze-pay-more-in-delhi-here-s-what-you-need-to-know-about-special-corona-fee/story-3petOdmHsSyMjnoAeyppbI.html
05-05-2020||India||West Bengal Governor, Mamata govt spar again||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Monday wrote another letter to chief minister Mamata Banerjee and pointed to a “collapsing health sector” and “politicised public distribution system” in West Bengal and triggered a fresh war of words with the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). He alleged West Bengal was “emerging as a police state” where voices of opposition parties were being muzzled.Dhankhar countered Banerjee’s allegation that he was trying to “usurp power” and said, “People in the state know only too well who in the state is usurper and extra-constitutional fountain of power. Who runs government and syndicates? Who is this ABCD! An open secret! Surely, I am not the person.”Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, have accused the TMC of running “syndicates”, which loosely refers to groups forcing people to buy products from them. Banerjee earlier replied to Dhankhar in response to the latter’s series of letters and social media posts. Dhankar wrote two letters to Banerjee on April 23 and 24.TMC lawmaker Sudip Banerjee dismissed Dhankar’s charges as “nonsense”. “We would take a call whether to respond to his statements and letters at all. He speaks gibberish. He is merely playing his role in the Centre’s plan to discredit Bengal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-governor-mamata-govt-spar-again/story-OFjyNR2oeB6XYNSbWzpQcO.html

He was working in an office on the second floor of the BSF headquarters and last visited the premises on May 1. The statement said the first and second floors of the building have been closed as a precaution.All drills for sanitisation are being undertaken, BSF said, adding that contact-tracing was also underway.BSF added that before the constable tested positive, its headquarters — an eight-storey building in the CGO complex on Lodhi Road in central Delhi — were closed on Friday, and the entire complex was thoroughly sanitised with prescribed solutions of disinfectants.BSF said on Sunday 42 of its personnel have been infected with Covid-19 so far. Of these, 31 belong to a 98-member unit that was deployed with the Delhi Police at the headquarters of Islmaic sect Tablighi Jamaat at Nizamuddin, which emerged as a major hot spot of the infection about a month ago.The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF)’s 140-odd personnel were found to have contracted the infection till Sunday.

05-05-2020||India||What’s the right measure of the impact of Covid-19?||On May 3, the day bridging the second and third phases of the lockdown, where did the different states of India stand with regard to deaths resulting from Covid-19? How do we decide which states are doing better?Usually, media reports mention the total number of deaths, but these are not adjusted for the size or the age structure of the population.That makes comparison between states difficult. A different number which stands out even more prominently in the reports is the Case Fatality Ratio (CFR), which refers to the deaths as a percentage of the cases diagnosed.Which is the number that provides a better comparison of the states?CFR has a clearly identifiable numerator: deaths attributed to Covid-19. The denominator can be very variable, based on the number of persons who tested positive for the virus and thus classified as cases. That, in turn, depends on the number of tests performed.All who are tested for the virus will not be positive, but more the number of tests performed, higher the total number of persons detected, even if the fraction of positive tests remains constant. Quite often, when large numbers are tested, more mild cases turn up among the positives and they are less likely to die. So, a high testing rate, with more cases detected and a greater proportion of milder cases, will lower the estimate of CFR. A lower testing rate, with tests usually reserved for the more severe cases, will yield a smaller denominator of cases and, therefore, a higher CFR. South Korea, which tested liberally, including several asymptomatic persons, had a low CFR because of the large number and lower composite risk profile of the cases included in the denominator.On the other hand, total deaths in any state are a clearly defined number at any given time, assuming that deaths are being correctly classified as Covid or non-Covid. However, the absolute number of deaths will also vary between states according to the size of their populations. If we standardise that measure and estimate deaths per one million population, we can compare different states more meaningfully. This figure yields a better picture of a state’s overall performance against the virus, capturing the benefit from the population level containment strategy as well as the clinical case management impact. It is this broadband package of public health and clinical interventions that has a combined effect on lowering deaths in any state. On the other hand, CFR usually gives us information only about the clinical treatment benefit. Only when we get a measure of all cases infected in a population -- severe, mild and asymptomatic included -- do we get an Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR), which invariably is lower than CFR.The two statistics (CFR and deaths per million) also give very different pictures about the states (Charts 1 and 2). If we look at CFR, Delhi (1.6 ) looks better than Punjab (2.6) or Jharkhand (2.6), which have lower testing rates. On the other hand, Punjab has far fewer deaths per million population (0.63) than Delhi (3.14). Jharkhand is even better (0.08 deaths per million). Where would you rather be today? Meghalaya looks terrible on CFR but is very well placed when the actual death rate in the population is considered. Odisha and Kerala do well in both, while Maharashtra and Gujarat stay high in both while minimally changing places .Statistics can be appealing or appalling, depending on how they are presented. The purpose of each statistic differs from another and the choice, of which to use when, is driven by the nature of assessment we wish to make. If performance of hospitals is being compared, CFR matters. If the overall state of the epidemic is being assessed, deaths per million is the statistic that tells us whether a state is in a safer zone than another. It is important that all of us -- policymakers, media and the public -- understand these measures and their distinctions so that we can soon get the measure of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-s-the-right-measure-of-the-impact-of-covid-19/story-qZMBpUKntbE5fDdUuqA4MK.html
05-05-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Life returned to normal with long queues outside liquor shops in most parts of the country, which is as understandable as it was avoidable. There have been many I-need-a-drink moments in the past 40 days. And there will be many more in the next two weeks, perhaps even after.One such was on Monday, with the release of the Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index by IHS Markit. This is essentially a measure of manufacturing activity, and, not surprisingly, it fell sharply in April to 27.4, the lowest since the data started being tracked 15 years ago. It’s also the first time the index has entered contraction zone in almost 11 quarters. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, and one below that contraction. And IHS Markit’s release spoke of both supply- and demand-side disruptions, and a loss of jobs — which doesn’t make for a pretty picture (see page 11).Monday was chaotic, and while much of it was because of the crowds outside liquor stores, not all was. There were far too many vehicles on the roads, and far too many people outside stores. For 40 days, everyone has been waiting to exhale, but this huge collective exhalation may end up being counterproductive to India’s efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease. After all, we know the connection between exhalation and the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19.And this is the situation during a graded exit; technically, the lockdown is still on till May 17. The mind boggles at what might’ve been had the government announced a complete exit from the lockdown on May 3 as some were demanding it do. If the phased exit, and the full one that will follow, are to work, then it will require people to be disciplined and follow the rules. India doesn’t have the luxury of waiting for the number of Covid-19 cases to begin to fall before opening up.By late morning on Monday, in Delhi, the angry noise of impatient car horns replaced the birdsong that has been in full play (it’s also the breeding season for many birds) for the past 40 days. By early afternoon, though, at least some of the liquor stores were shut down by local authorities (the district magistrates), citing overcrowding, absence of social distancing, and the fact that not everyone in the queues was wearing a mask (see page 2).In some ways, the PMI data and the unruly crowds outside liquor stores represent the dilemma before the government. It cannot afford to continue with the lockdown because the cure was beginning to hurt almost as much as the disease. India is yet to calculate the economic impact of zero sales for many products, tens of thousands of small businesses collapsing, millions of lost jobs, tens of millions of people pushed back into the same poverty from which they had successfully clawed their way out barely a few years ago — but it is certain to be high.No country should have to make the choice between lives and livelihoods — the reason why the understanding of Article 21 of the Constitution which guarantees the right to life has grown to include livelihoods — but this is one of the trade-offs countries are having to make in their policy response to the pandemic. As this column has pointed out, Sweden, with roughly double the number of deaths as India, but with only half the number of cases, sees its own response, of not locking down, as a success -- an opinion this writer doesn’t share.The importance of protecting both is why a relief and stimulus package for businesses is necessary. It was expected that India would announce one in late March. It’s early May and we are still waiting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-AWbAFNibHiWPzfpYFhuU6K.html

05-05-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Amid e-learning push, parents wary as children’s screen time increases||Rishabh Saxena, a Class 9 student of a south Delhi school, wakes up around 7am and, an hour later, plonks himself in front of the computer. He is in front of the screen until noon, attending one online class after another. Every evening, Rishabh spends up to three hours more on the computer to complete his class assignments.The daily routine of Shashwat Vinayak, a Class 10 student of another south Delhi school, isn’t much different. Face-to-face teaching, he says, helps students understand their lessons better, and is sorry that he and his peers have to spend so much time learning lessons online.Rishabh and Shashwant can’t help it. The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak shut down schools indefinitely before many completed their curriculums for the academic year, prompting them to start online lessons in a hurry. Parents are concerned that their children aren’t receiving in-depth education and are spending a little too long in front of the computer or mobile phone screen, questioning how much of a good thing is actually good. Ekta Saxena, Rishabh’s mother, says her son’s generation anyway tends to be glued to multiple screens, and it isn’t clear how healthy it is for children to sit for so long in front of the computer daily. “Will such a lifestyle lead to lethargy setting in? We are absolutely concerned about what the long-term impact of this new kind of lifestyle and teaching can be,” she said.Many parents are hoping that this is a temporary phenomenon that will fade with the lifting of the lockdown and the reopening of schools. But some say that online education is set to become the new normal in a post-Covid world.“Increased screen time can cause increased sedentary behaviour in children and teens, decreased metabolism, disturbance in sleep cycle, more distractibility and perhaps lower well- being,” said Dr Kanika Ahuja, who teaches psychology at Delhi’s Lady Shri Ram College. “The key question is how much is too much? We have no clear answers. There is an urgent need for research in India considering that a large part of education will be shifted online for at least 1-2 years.” Over the past two decades, several studies have linked too much of screen time with social isolation and depression, but newer studies say the link is tenuous.“The association we find between digital technology use and adolescent well-being is negative but small, explaining at most 0.4% of the variation in well-being. Taking the broader context of the data into account suggests that these effects are too small to warrant policy change,” according to a study on the association between adolescent well-being and digital technology use by researchers at the University of Oxford published in the journal, Nature Human Behaviour, in January 2019.Rajesh Sagar, professor, department of psychiatry, All India Institute Of Medical Sciences-Delhi, said ideally children below two years of age should not be exposed to gadgets. “And children above two should not be staring at a computer screen for more than 30 minutes in one go,” he said, adding that they should take breaks every half-an-hour in case they need to sit longer. PM Narendra Modi warned students against addiction to electronic gadgets earlier this year. In his Pareeksha pe Charcha (discussion on examinations) interaction with students in January, Modi said, “I’m all for using technology to advance our lives but let’s not allow ourselves to be enslaved by technology,” the PM said.A senior official at the ministry of human resource development, said the online effort is meant to ensure that the academic calendar is rolled out and the school session remains on track. Based on feedback, the ministry will take steps to address any emerging concerns||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-amid-e-learning-push-parents-wary-as-children-s-screen-time-increases/story-ejsLGZz5EiZCLxjThu2H3M.html

05-05-2020||India||Army chief pledges precise response to Handwara killings||Indian Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Monday said Pakistan was pushing terrorists into Jammu and Kashmir under its “myopic and limited” agenda even during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, and warned that India will respond appropriately and with “precision” to state-sponsored terrorism.The chief’s comments came two days after five security personnel, including a colonel and a major, were killed in an encounter in north Kashmir’s Handwara.“I would like to emphasise that Indian Army will give proportionate response to all acts of infringement of ceasefire and its (Pakistan’s) support to terrorism. The onus remains with Pakistan to bring peace in the region. Unless Pakistan gives up its policy of state-sponsored terrorism, we will continue to respond appropriately and with precision,” news agency PTI quoted the army chief as saying in an interview.There has been an unusual spike in ceasefire violations by the Pakistan Army at the Line of Control (LoC) this year to help infiltrators sneak into Jammu and Kashmir compared to border violations over recent years. The neighbouring army has violated the ceasefire about 1,400 times already this year. Violations by the Pakistan Army numbered 3,168 in 2019 and 1,629 in 2018.The army chief reiterated that the infiltration attempts by Pakistan along the LoC clearly indicated that the neighbouring army was not interested in battling the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and was pursuing “its own myopic and limited agenda of pushing terrorists inside India”.On the Handwara encounter, Naravane said the country was proud of Colonel Ashutosh Sharma, the commanding officer of the 21 Rashtriya Rifles battalion, and the four other security personnel who lost their lives while saving civilians from terrorists. A group of terrorists held civilian hostages inside a house at Changimulla village in the Rajwar forest when a five-man joint army-police team, led by Colonel Sharma, swung into action to rescue the hostages on Saturday. Sharma’s team was able to extricate the hostages but at the cost of their own lives.“Even in the hinterland, Pakistan-backed terrorists are resorting to targeting innocent civilians with an aim to coerce them into following their azadi narrative. Pakistan claims to be a friend of Kashmiris; I want to ask what sort of friend resorts to killing and spreads terror,” the PTI report quoted Naravane as saying.As reported by Hindustan Times on May 2, the nationwide lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic has not affected counter-insurgency operations in J&K. Instead, these operations have intensified and resulted in the killing of the highest number of terrorists belonging to different Pakistan-based outfits in April. On the implementation of recommendations of the anti-terror watchdog Financial Action Task Force by Pakistan, the army chief said Islamabad had made superficial changes to its “non-existent checks” on terror financing and money laundering. “It still continues to employ proxies to inflict terror and violence not only inside India but also in Afghanistan, where it supports the Taliban militarily and financially,” the army chief said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-pledges-precise-response-to-handwara-killings/story-aHl2IGejU0xvpX4iSVLqIJ.html
05-05-2020||India||Odisha Police book 7 for TikTok video shot inside quarantine centre||A day after 150 migrant workers fled from a quarantine centre in Ganjam district of Odisha, the state police on Monday booked seven inmates of a government quarantine centre in Bhadrak district for making a TikTok video violating social distancing norms.Police officials said the migrant workers from Kolkata kept in a quarantine centre in Tihidi High School under Bhatapada grampanchayat of Bhadrak district had shot the video while dancing to a popular Hindi song on Sunday. After the video went viral, sarpanch of Bhatapada, Swarnamayee Jena lodged a FIR against them under sections 188/269/270 of IPC and Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act for violating social distancing norms in the quarantine centre.The sarpanch alleged that the quarantined people wanted to leave the centre after testing negative in the first Covid-19 test. However, they were urged to stay in the facility for the stipulated 14 days.In another instance of violation of quarantine norms, 22 migrant workers who had arrived in Bhadrak district from Surat by bus went to their homes instead of going to the quarantine centre at Bhandaripokhari ITI. The migrant workers reportedly disembarked from their bus a few miles before their quarantine centre and escaped.The twin incidents coming within a day after 150 migrant workers of Ganjam ran away from the quarantine centre has increased concerns for the Naveen Patnaik-led government that is bracing for the return of about 6 lakh migrant workers from different states. With more than 58 of the 8800-odd migrant workers testing positive, Odisha officials said migrants jumping quarantine may lead to community transmission if not stopped. On Monday, 7 positive Covid-19 cases were reported, six of whom were migrant returnees from Kolkata.Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik took to Twitter to appeal to the migrant workers to stay put in the quarantine centres.“As far as the Covid-19 situation is concerned, Odisha is doing quite well to contain it. But to achieve this success, a lot of Odias have gone out of their way and comfort zones. They have sacrificed a lot to keep the people of Odisha safe from coronavirus. Those who are returning to Odisha should show similar conviction and discharge their duty with utmost sincerity,” said Patnaik, adding that the sarpanch of the gram panchayats should inform the authorities on any quarantine violation, so that strict action can be initiated against the accused.Warning the violators, Odisha DGP Abhay said any conduct endangering safety of others will be strongly dealt with as per law. “Our hospitality for returnees does not mean leniency towards negligence. I appeal to all returnees to follow the laid down norms while in quarantine,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-police-book-7-for-tiktok-video-shot-inside-quarantine-centre/story-c2EYxFkXRV8GBd0tjQs0lM.html
05-05-2020||India||Bengal govt finds ‘missing Covid-19 data’ after IMCT letter questions mismatch||On a day the inter-ministerial central team sent a letter to the state government questioning the mismatch in its data related to Covid-19, the Mamata Banerjee-led administration claimed to have found all ‘missing data’, while admitting that there were gaps in data that was being released by the government every day. “There was an issue of missing data which is why there were some gaps. All missing data have been retrieved. Now we are in a position to share all this data every day,” Rajiva Sinha, chief secretary of West Bengal said on Monday.A major controversy had erupted after state health secretary Vivek Kumar’s letter to union health secretary Preeti Sudan put the total number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the state at 931 as of April 30, whereas the state administration’s data shared with journalists till that day added up to 816.However, the data shared by the state on Monday supports neither figure. The government said that the total number of patients testing positive stood at 1,259 on Monday, with 229 new cases between May 1 and May 4, which put the figure as of April 30 at 1,030.“There were gaps in data which was triggering confusion. We found that the data reporting structure was highly complicated and some data was not being registered at all. It was not deliberate. We have improved. We searched all data over the weekend and compiled everything so that there is no missing data,” Sinha added.As a result, while the state government’s data so long showed fewer numbers of cases than in the data shared by the union health ministry, Bengal’s Monday’s data stood well above what has been shared by the union health ministry.The government on Monday said of the total 1,259 Covid-19 cases, 908 were active cases, 218 people had recovered and been discharged from hospitals, 61 people died of Covid-19 and another 72 died of ‘co-morbidity’. “Bengal is turning out to be India’s Covid-19 hub. The state government’s mismanagement led to this situation. Without IMCT’s intervention, we would have never known the real picture regarding the number of deaths and persons infected,” BJP state unit president Dilip Ghosh alleged on Monday.The IMCT for south Bengal, before leaving the state for Delhi, sent a letter to the chief secretary on Monday accusing the state of fudging Covid-19 related data and suppressing facts. The team, which was in Bengal since April 20, will submit its report to the ministry of home affairs soon. The number of containment zones in the state has shot up from 444 on April 30 to 516 on May 4. Kolkata, with 318 such areas, has the highest number of containment zones.Meanwhile, the bulletin published by the state on Monday showed that only four districts have been tagged as Red Zones in Bengal. On April 30, the union health ministry had released a list which said that Bengal has ten Red Zones.The state’s ruling party Trinamool Congress (TMC) targeted BJP for politicizing an administrative issue. On social media, Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and TMC youth wing chief Abhishek Banerjee wrote, “In their desperation to score cheap political points, those who are misrepresenting facts and maligning Bengal even daring to call Bengal - ‘Wuhan of India’ should look at facts: % +ve per million: 14, rank 16th, Total Cases: 1259, rank 9th, Active cases: 908, rank 10th.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-govt-finds-missing-covid-19-data-after-imct-letter-questions-mismatch/story-0iatsiCmfeQhvpEsdNW7cO.html
05-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Row over migrants’ rail fare as Congress offers to foot the bill||A fierce political war broke out over the issue of train fare for the migrant workers returning home, with the Congress declaring that the party and its state committees would pay the fare to enable workers to return and accusing the Centre of being insensitive to their plight. The Union government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), for their part, claimed that railways was bearing 85% of the fare cost, and state governments had to pay 15%, thus allowing migrants to go back home free of cost. While the government also claimed it had never spoken of charging stranded migrants, and said the onus rested on state governments, the Opposition rebutted the assertion, citing government orders which asked state governments to collect fares from migrants and hand them over to railways. Experts pointed out that Indian Railways does provide an in-built subsidy for train journeys, which is the highest in sleeper class, the mode of travel in special trains, but also underlined that the government had to incur higher expenditure because of additional costs currently. The controversy involves an estimated 10 million migrant workers stranded after the sudden imposition of a lockdown on March 25. Many of them lost their jobs because of the lockdown and the suspension of all economic activities aimed at halting the spread of the deadly coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In the absence of public transport, many tried to walk back home but were turned back at state borders and housed in shelters run by the government and non governmental organisations. Last week, the union government finally released a protocol for their movement by bus. Soon after, Indian Railways announced it would run special trains for them.When the special trains first began operating on Friday, stranded migrants travelling from Maharashtra, Kerala, Gujarat, Karnataka and some other states were charged rail fares for their journey back home. On Monday, officials said states including Rajasthan, Telangana and Gujarat were paying for the tickets, even as the BJP said that its government in Madhya Pradesh was also bearing the expense.On Monday morning, Congress president Sonia Gandhi led the charge against the government, saying the current plight of migrant workers and their desperate attempts to return home was the biggest human tragedy since the Partition. Gandhi said that even today, as workers were languishing in different parts of the country, wishing to return, there was neither enough money nor provisions for free transport. “What is particularly disturbing is that the Central government and the rail ministry are charging them for train tickets in this hour of crisis.” Gandhi asked why was it that when the government could spend Rs 100 crore on a single event – in what appeared to be a reference to the Namaste Trump event to honour United States President Donald Trump during his India visit in February – and the railways could donate Rs 151 crore to the PM-Cares fund, “essential members of the nation’s fabric” were not offered the basic courtesy of free rail travel? The Congress president said that in this backdrop, the party had decided every state committee would “bear the cost of rail travel of every needy worker and migrant labourer”. This would be its “humble contribution”. The decision came in the wake of Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar, on Sunday, offering Rs 1 crore to the state-run transport service as the cost towards sending the stranded workers back home from Bengaluru and other parts of the state.The government, however, rejected the allegations. At a regular press briefing, health ministry joint secretary Lav Agrawal, said that based on the request given from states for particular cases, permission was given to run special trains. “Be it government of India or the railways, we have not talked about charging from workers. 85% of the transportation cost is borne by the railways, while states have to bear 15 of the cost,” he told reporters. The BJP also countered the Congress. Party spokesperson Sambit Patra, in a tweet to Congress Member of Parliament, Rahul Gandhi, said, “I have attached guidelines of MHA which clearly state that ‘No tickets to be sold at any station’. Railways has subsidised 85% & state govt to pay 15%. The state govt can pay for the tickets (Madhya Pradesh’s BJP govt is paying). Ask Cong state govts to follow suit.” The party’s information technology cell chief Amit Malviya claimed that the Congress was “obviously upset” at how well India had handled Covid. “They would have ideally wanted a lot more people to suffer and die. Promoting indiscriminate movement of people would lead to faster spread of infection, just like we saw in Italy. Is this what Sonia Gandhi wants?” he asked. Congress leaders KC Venugopal and Randeep Singh Surjewala, however, read out a May 2 circular by the railways ministry stating that state governments will pay the entire amount to the railways after collecting the ticket fares from migrant workers. At the heart of the controversy are two separate points. The first is whether the government placed the onus on state governments or migrant workers to pay the fare; the second is the government’s claim of taking care of 85% of the cost. Both these arguments come in the wake of a series of decisions and clarifications by the government over the past week. On Wednesday, on the 36th day of the lockdown, the Centre allowed movement of stranded migrants and students through buses. Amid demands by states and in recognition of the logistical challenges involved in transporting millions of workers, the home ministry, on Friday, also allowed the movement of migrants by special trains to be deployed at the request of the state governments. The ministry of railways, on the same day, announced it had decided to charge for tickets for operating special trains for stranded migrant workers amid the coronavirus lockdown. The fare includes the price of regular sleeper class tickets plus superfast charges of Rs 30 and an additional charge of Rs 20.“This includes meals and drinking water for long-distance trains. State governments will coordinate and can pay on passengers’ behalf,” the ministry clarified. On Saturday, the rail ministry issued a standard operating procedure on movement of passengers. The railways would print train tickets to specified destinations on the basis of the number of passengers indicated by an originating state, and give the tickets to the local government authority. It said, “The local state government authority shall hand over the tickets to the passengers cleared by them and collect the ticket fare and hand over the total amount to the railways.” This was followed by another note on Sunday. The rail ministry said, “As per the guidelines issued, sending state will pay the consolidated fare to Railways. Sending state may decide to bear this cost or take it from passengers or take it from receiving state after mutual consultation or may charge it to any fund. It is purely their prerogative.” It is this ambiguity that both the government and the opposition are basing their case on. The Centre is emphasising that it had placed the onus on state governments, while the Opposition is emphasising that the Centre had placed the onus on state governments to charge money from passengers. According to officials aware of the development, 45 Shramik Special trains have run till now and around 13 more are tentatively planned for Monday, and payments have been made by most states barring Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra thus far. States with originating trains such as Rajasthan, Telangana, and Gujarat are paying for the migrants, while Jharkhand, which has only received such trains, has also paid for the travel of workers. On Monday, Bihar said it would pay for the migrants. The Gujarat government has drafted an NGO to pay part of the travel cost, officials from the states said.Mohammed Tabraq of Bihar’s Jamui, who arrived from Kerala, said he had to borrow money as he did not have even a penny left with him. Another worker from Jharkhand’s Pakur, Kamaruddin Ansari, who was working in Kerala, said he paid ~860 for the journey from Kozhikode to Dhanbad. “We were given a ticket at the entry gate and allowed at the platform after paying the ticket price,” he claimed.The second issue is the scale of subsidy offered by the Centre, and its claim of taking care of 85% of the cost. A senior rail ministry official, familiar with the train fare structure, said that railways recover about 57% of cost of travel on an average and the remaining is given as subsidy. On an average, it pays 43 paise per rupee for each ticket as subsidy. This is not a traditional subsidy, but is instead cross-subsidised from the money railways makes from its freight operations.Explaining the rationale of the government’s claim, the official added: “The special trains are carrying only 60% of the passenger capacity in the trains due to social distancing norms. The trains are also running along with food arrangements, security, etc. After that, empty rakes also return back to the stations, for which ministry has to incur the cost. Even in normal times, the railways give about 50% subsidy to passengers for travelling. Keeping that in mind only 15-20% cost of railways expenses is being charged from the states.” He added that it was important to have this cost structure to also regulate movement, for unregulated crowds at stations would only lead to the possibility of the spread of the coronavirus disease. Former railway board chairman Vivek Sahai pointed out that it is the unreserved segment which accounts for the most subsided travel in railways in any case. “The unreserved segment has the maximum subsidy. In the sleeper segment the railways provides about 43-45% subsidy. A sleeper coach normally has an occupancy of 75 people. Assuming they have done away with the middle berth for social distancing, only about 54 people would be travelling. Hence their earnings are about 28% less, which would mean a subsidy of about 71% for the travel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-migrants-rail-fare-as-cong-offers-to-foot-the-bill/story-XrPFuQeVL9Mu3irfpbAQgM.html
05-05-2020||India||Nanded-linked cases push up Punjab Covid-19 tally||Punjab reported a big spike of 104 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Monday, most of them pilgrims who recently returned from a Nanded gurdwara that has led to a cluster of infections, as the case count in the state rose to 1,232, according to officials.A total of 795 of about 4,100 pilgrims who returned from Hazur Sahib in Maharashtra’s Nanded have so far tested positive for the disease, a health official said on Monday, adding that the test reports of about 1,800 of the pilgrims were still awaited.About two-thirds of the total cases in Punjab can be attributed to the Nanded gurdwara cluster, according to the numbers released by the state officials.An official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said as the pilgrims began returning to Punjab, 700 of them were sent to their hometowns to be quarantined at their houses after thermal scanning.In Ludhiana, the district administration sealed five villages near Samrala and Machhiwara as a preventive measure. The state government started tracing and testing the pilgrims from Nanded only after three of them tested positive in Tarn Taran district on April 27.“Our entire focus has been to test the pilgrims. The process may take another couple of days,” a senior official said, asking not to be named.State transport minister Razia Sultana on Monday dismissed a statement attributed to Maharashtra minister Ashok Chavan that appeared to suggest that the pilgrims could have caught the disease from the Punjab bus driver who ferried them back.Of the total cases in the state, 23 have died, while 128 have been cured of the infection, the state’s bulletin said on Monday, adding that three patients were in a critical condition and were on ventilator support.A total of 28,545 samples have been taken so far in the state and of which, 21,295 have returned negative and 6,018 reports are still awaited. There are 1,081 active cases in the state, as per bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nanded-linked-cases-push-up-punjab-tally/story-vA1xTZUVuKxvreu2PbM8jI.html
05-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Bustle, chaos as lockdown 3.0 begins||A degree of chaos and confusion prevailed on the first day of India’s lockdown 3.0 — this is the third extension of the national lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, but with substantial relaxations in restrictions — with several citizens violating social distancing norms and authorities struggling to enforce a complex set of regulations across the country on Monday. The most visible symbol of India’s partial opening up — and the challenges that come with it — were licensed liquor shops, which were allowed to resume operations after 40 days. Be it in Delhi or Kolkata, Bengaluru or Jaipur, and be it in the poshest locales or lower middle-class colonies or slums, it was in front of liquor shops that people queued up for kilometres, jostling with each other, often not wearing masks, violating social distancing protocols, and in many cases, leading the police personnel to use force to disperse crowds or authorities to shut down shops. In Delhi, alarmed by the reports of these violations, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal — who had only on Sunday asked for the lockdown to be entirely lifted — warned that strict measures, including more restrictions and sealing, would be introduced if the trend persisted. Experts, however, pointed out that the government should have anticipated the challenge, and in the case of liquor shops, either not enforced stringent restrictions in the first place, or allowed a more widespread reopening to ensure adequate supply. Monday also saw greater traffic movement than during the last 40 days as more shops and offices opened for business, but this was coupled with confusion in enforcing norms — with local authorities in different states struggling to distinguish between activities and individuals permitted to be out and those who needed to stay home. One big relaxation that kicked in was the decision to allow self-employed people, including domestic help, plumbers, and electricians, to work. But resident welfare associations were divided on the issue. In the Capital, while many neighbourhoods allowed workers to come in, others advised caution. Sudha Sinha, president of Federation of CGHS Dwarka limited, said, “We have requested residents in all societies to wait till May 17. There is no harm in waiting for a while, especially when cases are increasing every day.”In other cities in the country, officials reported higher traffic on roads a large number of industries resumed operations. Still, a large population still worked from home, and the traffic was not close to normal. Some rush was also reported at local markets, where shops selling non-essentials such as stationery and clothes opened. But a big challenge was in implementing the guidelines. An official in Delhi said, “To be able to know who is within the 33% of a private office workforce and therefore is allowed to go to work is difficult. To be able to explain to people what activities are still not allowed when they think it may all have opened up is difficult. We will have to communicate better, and citizens will have to be more responsible.”Around 150 liquor shops opened in Delhi on Monday to loud cheers and applause. But this lasted only briefly as the jostling for space began. The crowd represented all classes, coming in SUVs and sedans, but also on motorcycles and rickshaws. In places such as Ashram, Govindpuri and Vasant Vihar, the queue was more than a kilometre long while people flouted social distancing norms. In places such as the Lajpat Nagar flyover near Srinivaswpuri, the queue of buyers also caused a traffic jam, prompting police to lathi-charge the crowd.Delhi police officials said that by around 3pm, almost 90% of the shops were shut. Joint commissioner of police(eastern range) Alok Kumar said, “We did not resort to lathi charge but to used mild force to disperse the crowd. The few shops that were open today shut shop on their own. We will follow the government’s order and will ensure that people are disciplined while standing on the queue.”While many blamed citizens for being irresponsible, policy experts said the government should have been more careful. Shakti Sinha, a retired bureaucrat who has served as secretary in the Delhi government, said, “The government should have anticipated demand; planned better; allowed more shops to open up; provided for home delivery options and recognised that it will be difficult to control crowds.” Former Delhi chief secretary, Rakesh Mehra, said that even though liquor shops are a major source of revenue for the state governments, opening only limited number of shops resulted in crowding in these stores. “I don’t know what prompted the government to open some shops while keeping the rest closed. Alcohol is not like your regular non-essential commodities where people think that they would only go out to buy when shops near their houses open. Limiting supply will only lead to crowding, panic buying and chaos,” Mehra said. In the rest of the country too, the most challenging situation for authorities was in liquor shops. In West Bengal, the police had to wield batons and chase away customers at many shops, including one located in the Kalighat area. By 12pm, most of the shops downed shutters again. Later, the excise department allowed online sale and home delivery. In UP, 23,000 liquor shops opened — but social distance norms were frequently violated. In Karnataka, long queues could be seen outside liquor outlets much before the official opening time of 9am. In some places, people “reserved” their spot since Sunday night by leaving slippers, bags and other personal items. In Mumbai, select liquor shop owners said they will deploy bouncers from Tuesday to control crowds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bustle-chaos-as-lockdown-3-0-begins/story-29jHuyKyOJmAhsXq0j9zbJ.html
05-05-2020||India||In 10-15 days, we’ll send all migrant labourers back to home states: Gujarat CM||Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani spoke to Smriti Kak Ramachandran about Ahmedabad emerging as a Covid-19 hot spot, the concerns of migrant workers, and getting the state economy back on track. Edited excerpts:Gujarat continues to see a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases. There are over 5,000 cases and 300 deaths, making the state one of the worst hit. Was there a slip up in arresting the spread of the virus? The state was under lockdown even before the nationwide lockdown was announced. There was a complete ban on movement of people. However, Gujarat is one of the leading states in India with a large number of international and domestic travellers. This increases the possibility of more cases. By the time we registered our first case on March 19, we’d screened around 30,000 passengers and put them under quarantine. After the nationwide lockdown, we ensured strict implementation of MHA guidelines. Meanwhile, a large number of people who attended the Tablighi Jamat Markaz, came here, and by the time we could track them, they had already come in contact with their friends, family and other people. This led to the rise of cases. Many hid their travel history. Had they co-operated with us, Ahmedabad would not have become a Covid-19 hot spot.Another reason for rise in cases is our intensive testing capacity. With a capacity of 3,000 per day, we have tested around 80,000 people till date. The government has not been able to reach out to allay the fears of migrant workers. There have been several instances of migrant workers rushing out on the streets; of stone-pelting and tear gas. Gujarat has developed a number of regional economic centres, with Ahmedabad and Surat being the biggest. These cities host lakhs of labourers. We acknowledge their contribution in the development and prosperity of our economy. And we are empathetic towards their concerns. The lockdown has been a challenging time for all of us, and especially for them. We ensured arrangements of proper food and shelter. We provided free foodgrain to migrant workers, including to those without ration cards. More than 10 lakh food packets are being distributed on a daily basis to the needy and there are shelter homes for the homeless.However, there was another challenge of no work. The workers in Surat demanded to go back. The guidelines of the lockdown did not allow us to make travel arrangements for them in April. But, we did allow industrial units outside the containment zones to resume work, under certain conditions, followed by permitting export-oriented units outside containment zones. This led to opening up of more than 40,000 industrial units and businesses and around seven lakh labourers could resume work.There are still thousands who want to go back to their homes and their families. First, we plied state transport buses to ferry people to nearby states. Now, the Indian Railways has started ‘Shramik Trains’, and we are allowing people to travel to their respective home states. The train’s capacity is 1,200 passengers per journey; I believe it will take 10-15 days for all the labourers to be able to go back to their respective states.Since there is large-scale movement of labourers from Gujarat, are you worried that the state may face a shortage of manpower? Based on central guidelines, we decided to resume industrial operations from April 20 in areas outside containment zones and municipal limits. I do not think we will face a shortage of manpower in any of the sectors. I am confident that more and more units will be permitted by my administration to resume operations in the days to come, and more labourers will resume their jobs. What are the immediate steps being taken to revive economy? We decided to restart all those industrial units and businesses falling outside the limits of municipalities and municipal corporations and containment zones. We also provided the freedom to labourers to work for a 12-hour shift with additional remuneration for extra hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-10-15-days-we-ll-send-all-migrant-labourers-back-to-their-home-states-gujarat-cm/story-fAx1pshJm6oKQLDY1El7zN.html
05-05-2020||India||Migrant workers, police clash in Gujarat’s Surat; 204 held||Surat: Gujarat police on Monday arrested 204 migrant workers who allegedly stoned policemen, demanding that they be allowed to go home. The workers, mainly from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, were charged with rioting and attempt to murder after the fourth incident of violence in Surat in the past 23 days.The restive crowd torched handcarts on the roads besides hurling stones at the police in the violence that left 15 policemen and around 20 others injured, the police said. “The incident took place around 11 am in Vareli village in Kadodra police station area. Some people instigated the workers saying that nobody would pay heed to their demand of returning to their homes in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, if they did not gather in large numbers, after which around 1,000 people gathered on the streets, demanding return to their homes,” said S Pandia Raj Kumar, inspector general of police (IGP), Surat range.The IGP said teams from the local police station reached the spot and tried to convince the migrant workers to disperse after submitting a representation that would be passed on to the district administration.“The talks were going on but around 11.30 am some elements started pelting stones on policemen. Some of them threw petrol bombs too and damaged public property including shops. To control the situation, the police had to use teargas shells and force,” Kumar said. Ajay Singh, a resident of Vareli village, said: the administration had been assuring migrant workers for the past one month that transport would be arranged to their home states. “We have run out of cash. We have no money to feed our children,” he said, adding that the workers had not got even been paid pending wages.SB Singh, general secretary of the Mazdoor Ekta Union, Surat, said the government had started 10 Shramik Special trains to Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Bhopal, Agra and Puri but had failed to counsel workers to be patient.“The workers are angry as the government has not even tried to reach out to them. Nobody has told them about the process {they have to follow} to go back,” he said, explaining the reason for anger among workers. According a study by the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad, migrants contribute about 70% of Surat’s workforce and 50% of Ahmedabad’s.

05-05-2020||India||With 3,861 new cases, Covid-19 count crosses 46,000-mark||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in India grew by 3,861 on Monday, a fresh record for new cases that pushed the nationwide tally of confirmed infections across the country to over 46,000. For the first time, the number of deaths in a single day were in the triple digits as 101 new fatalities took the total toll to 1,494.Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu together accounted for more than half of the new cases recorded on Monday, logging 1,567 and 527 fresh infections respectively. In both these regions, the tally in the past 24 hours was nearly double of what had been seen in the two days before.The spike in infections and fatalities came on a day when much of the country entered a new phase in the crisis with curbs easing significantly for the first time since the nationwide shutdown came into force on March 25 to slow the spread of the disease.“We are transitioning into a new normal and we need to be aware and vigilant... Everyone must strictly follow social distancing practices even outside the containment zones,” said Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal at the government’s daily briefing on the Covid-19 crisis.National capital Delhi recorded 349 new infections but no new deaths, while West Bengal – where single-day increases were in the double digits till Sunday – registered a jump in tally by 337 cases. Officials in Bengal said the count included an unspecified number of cases that had been left out, an admission that comes amid allegations from federal authorities that the state was underplaying the scale of the crisis.Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi and West Bengal were the five top states in terms of new infections.But, in what he described as an improvement, Agarwal said that a record number – 1,074 – people recovered from the disease in the 24 hours between Sunday and Monday. The outcome ratio of Covid-19 -- the ratio of recoveries and deaths -- was now at 90:10. The outcome ratio on April 17 was 80:20 and the new ratio can be seen as an improvement, Agarwal said. According to the official, around 27.5% people have recovered so far from the disease. While the increase in numbers are largely being driven by the top five states and their urban centres, several smaller states and union territories – such as Goa, Puducherry, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Meghalaya, Assam, Aruranchal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh, Manipur, Mizoram, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Tripura -- have logged nil or few cases in recent days.Kerala is the only state with a mid-to-large sized population that recorded no new cases for the second consecutive day, underscoring the success of its containment efforts. Kerala has become one of the safest and secured industrial investment centers in the world after handking the Covid-19 crisis effectively, said the state Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Monday that the success of the state’s health care system had made it “one the safest and most secured industrial investment centres in the world.” “We are getting a lot of inquiries from investors and entrepreneurs from around the world who is interested in Kerala. Our strength is the manpower here and we have once again proved that our human resources are comparable to any developed nation in the world,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-3-861-new-cases-covid-count-crosses-46-000-mark/story-fNI8p7pxlhsNAjjR0MwrjN.html
05-05-2020||India||Delhi schoolboy who discussed raping girls on Bois Locker Room chat group questioned||The Delhi police on Monday took suo motu cognisance of social media posts, sharing screenshots of an online group -- bois locker room -- wherein some school students had allegedly shared messages about gang-raping their classmates and morphing their photographs. Police have also questioned a 15-year-old in the matter on Monday. Deputy commissioner of police, cyber crime, Anyesh Roy said the department has come to know about the group through social media monitoring. “No one has come forward with a complaint so far. We have taken suo motu cognisance of the social media posts. We are registering a case under the Information Technology (IT) Act and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code,” he said.A senior police officer, who wished not to be named, said they have received a complaint on behalf of a South Delhi private school. The officer said one of the boys has been picked up for questioning. “As of now, it seems all the members of the group belonged to one school,” said the officer.The screenshots of chats on this Instagram group -- bois locker room-- were made public by some girls on social media platforms, including Twitter and Instagram, on Saturday. The incident has created a havoc on social media with questions being raised over the safety of women.In the shared screenshots, the group members can be seen discussing female anatomy and rating their female classmates on appearance.The group members also talked of taking revenge on girls who had posted about them on social media by circulating the girls’ nude picturesThe group was later deleted from Instagram. Another senior police officer said the initial investigation suggests that there were around 30 members in the group. “Some of them were involved in such conversations, others weren’t. In the chats, the students had shared morphed images of female classmates and could be seen talking about gang-raping them,” said another officer, adding that some of the group members had taken a screen shot of the conversation and these had made it to the social media.Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) has also issued notices to the Delhi police and the Instagram seeking a report in connection with the incident. “It’s reported that the group was used for sharing objectionable pictures of minor girls and young women many a time with their personal information. The members of the group have been reported to have discussed techniques of raping women and gang-raping minors. The commission is in receipt of many screenshots of the group wherein the handle names and usernames are clearly visible,” DCW chief Swati Malliwal said in the orders issued to both the police and the Instagram.The DCW has sought details from them about the group and its members and an investigation into the matter by Friday.Several school and college-going girls on Monday said they have been shaken by the incident. “According a tweet, the boys in the group are school-going teenagers. Some girls have even identified them. It’s so scary. They have shared nude pictures of girls and posted rape threats. My friends and I are in shock after reading all those messages. My mother even asked me to quit Instagram,” said Sneha Agarwal, a class 11 student at a South Delhi private school.Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union (JNUSU) president Aishe Ghosh in a statement said that steps need to be taken to improve cyber laws to create a safe cyber space for women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-take-note-of-rape-threats-on-social-media-group-of-schoolboys/story-loYqRytz0h5PMSIfsirVKI.html
05-05-2020||India||India questions Pakistan over holding polls in Gilgit Baltistan||India on Monday lodged a strong protest with Pakistan over a move to conduct elections in Gilgit Baltistan, with New Delhi saying the region is an integral part of the country that had been “illegally and forcibly occupied”.A senior Pakistani diplomat was served a “demarche” or formal diplomatic representation over telephone to lodge India’s strong protest against the Pakistan supreme court’s recent order allowing the setting up of a caretaker administration in Gilgit-Baltistan to hold fresh elections, people familiar with developments said.“It was clearly conveyed that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including the areas of Gilgit and Baltistan, are an integral part of India by virtue of its fully legal and irrevocable accession,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement.“The Government of Pakistan or its judiciary has no locus standi on territories illegally and forcibly occupied by it,” it said.Later in the day, Pakistan responded by summoning a senior Indian diplomat in Islamabad to reject “India’s baseless and fallacious contention” regarding the supreme court’s order on Gilgit-Baltistan.India claims the whole of the erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir, including Gilgit-Baltistan region, which was given near-provincial status by the Pakistan government in 2009.On April 30, Pakistan’s supreme court allowed authorities to amend the Government of Gilgit-Baltistan Order 2018 to set up a caretaker administration in the region to conduct fresh elections. The order was issued in response to a petition filed by the Imran Khan government.The term of the current “government” in Gilgit-Baltistan is set to end on June 24 and elections have to be held within 60 days.However, the external affairs ministry said India “completely rejects such actions and continued attempts to bring material changes in Pakistan-occupied areas of the Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir”, and instead, Pakistan “should immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation”.“It was further conveyed that such actions can neither hide the illegal occupation of parts of Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh by Pakistan nor the grave human rights violations, exploitation and denial of freedom to the people residing in Pakistan-occupied territories for the past seven decades,” the statement said.The Indian government’s position on Gilgit-Baltistan is reflected in the resolution passed by Parliament in 1994 by consensus, the statement added.The resolution described Jammu & Kashmir as an integral part of India and demanded Pakistan “must vacate” areas of the state “occupied through aggression”.The people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the demarche was read out over telephone in view of the Covid-19 lockdown. In normal circumstances, a diplomat can be summoned to the external affairs ministry to receive the demarche.Several other recent demarches were read out to Pakistani diplomats over telephone, the people said.A statement from Pakistan’s Foreign Office said the Indian diplomat was told the Indian claim to Jammu & Kashmir “had no legal basis” and the entire state was a “disputed” territory. It added, “No subsequent illegal and unilateral Indian actions could or have altered the status of Jammu and Kashmir as a disputed territory.”The Pakistani side contended the Kashmir issue could be resolved only by implementing UN Security Council resolutions that recognise the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination through a plebiscite under UN auspices. It described the scrapping of Kashmir’s special status by India as “illegal and in clear violation” of UN resolutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-questions-pak-over-holding-polls-in-gilgit-baltistan/story-qBYRFXj0gYmuoqnVVfkO8K.html
05-05-2020||India||Arnab Goswami belittling police by tweets, TV shows: Maharashtra||The Maharashtra government has accused senior journalist Arnab Goswami of interfering with the probe by using his tweets and television debates to browbeat the Mumbai Police.In an application moved before the top court, the state sought urgent orders to restrain the journalist from engaging in such acts that creates a “fear psychosis” among the force impeding their ability to probe the case without fear or favour.Goswami faces complaints of inciting hatred among religious groups, which are now being probed under a single complaint at the NM Joshi Marg police station in Mumbai.The state’s application seems to be a response to an earlier order by the apex court, on April 24, saying the police cannot take any coercive action against Goswami for three weeks. The direction came on a petition by Goswami who sought clubbing of multiple cases against him along with protection from arrest.The fresh application by the state said, “Petitioner (Goswami) considers indulgence granted by this Court as some kind of a license to indulge in unwarranted sensationalism and to ridicule, denigrate, and defame the police department and its officers.” The application seeks a restraint order against Goswami from indulging in such acts that tantamount to interference with probe. A further direction has been sought asking Goswami not to abuse the indulgence granted to him by the Court on April 24 and cooperate with investigation.The application stated that the television show hosted by Goswami on April 28 showed Commissioner of Police in bad light by making false charges against him. Accusing him of making a “media spectacle” of the case against him, the application said, “The act and conduct of the petitioner would tantamount to encroaching upon the area of investigation (sole prerogative of police) as also subjecting the entire criminal justice system to ridicule.”Goswami has also been accused of carrying out a “vicious propaganda” against the police by abusing his journalistic freedom to malign the police force and its chief using false allegations. Incidentally, Goswami has filed a second petition in the apex court with regard to a fresh FIR lodged against him on May 2, seeking similar relief from arrest. When contacted by HT for a comment on the matter, Goswami’s legal representatives declined to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goswami-belittling-police-by-tweets-tv-shows-maha/story-UqUWdSsIpmaINcJNDbda8K.html

05-05-2020||India||‘Special corona fee’: Delhi govt to charge 70% tax on liquor from today||The Delhi government on Monday imposed a “special corona fee” of 70% of the MRP on all categories of liquor that will be sold in the city with effect from Tuesday.The fee was approved by Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and a notification was later issued by the Delhi government’s finance department. The fee would apply at “70% of the maximum retail price of all categories of liquor sold through written licences for consumption off the premises,” read the order. Senior government officials said that the lockdown since March 25 to prevent the spread of Covid-19 cost the Delhi government around Rs 645 crore in revenue from the sale of alcohol, when calculated on the basis of revised estimates in the 2019-20 state budget. The excise department was preparing a full report on the exact revenue loss incurred by the ban on the sale of liquor for over 40 days, they said.The Delhi government’s late night move will boost the government revenue but will also result in a steep rise in the prices of retails liquor bottle. For instance, a liquor bottle with a maximum retail price of Rs 1,000 earlier, will now cost Rs 1,700 in the city.The Finance Department of the Delhi government said “70 per cent of the maximum retail price (will be levied) on all categories of liquor sold through retail licensees for consumption....” Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal warned that his government would be forced to shut shops -- opened under conditional scaling down of the lockdown restrictions applicable till May 17 – in case of violation of social distancing norms.Kejriwal’s warning came after the chaos that followed the opening of government-run wine shops in the city after 40 days. Many liquor shops had to be shut and at some places police had to disperse huge crowds that had gathered in front of the shops.According to an official, about 150 government-run liquor shops have been allowed to open from 9 am to 6:30 pm in accordance with the latest lockdown relaxations given by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).Delhi registered another big spike of 349 new cases of Covid-19 that took the national capital’s tally to 4,898, the health department said in a statement Monday night.There are 3,403 active cases while 1,431 people have recovered from Covid-19.

05-05-2020||India||Rajya Sabha plans to save Rs 80 crore amid Covid-19 crisis||As the nation battles the Covid-19 pandemic, the Rajya Sabha expects to save around Rs.80 crore this financial year by cutting expenses on the purchase of vehicles, reducing the number of study visits by parliamentary committees, keeping on hold international travel and training of its officials as well as the award of fellowships and internships under the upper house’s research scheme.The austerity measures were decided at a meeting of the Rajya Sabha secretariat chaired by vice president and Rajya Sabha chairperson M Venkaiah Naidu, who wanted an expenditure reduction plan to be prepared, an official aware of the details of the meeting said on condition of anonymity.“Secretary general Desh Deepak Verma informed {the meeting} that saving of Rs. 60 crore has already been identified against the annual budget of Rs. 423 crore for the secretariat for 2020-21. And a total saving of Rs. 80 core is being targeted as the financial year progresses,” the official said.Against the backdrop of the extension of the coronavirus lockdown until May 17 and the need for the undivided focus of the executive on containing the spread of the disease, Naidu said a view will be taken later on holding meetings of department-related standing committees and other panels of the upper house.This was the first meeting Naidu has held with senior officials of the Rajya Sabha secretariat since the nationwide lockdown came into effect on March 25.Naidu also instructed officials to initiate action to fill up the vacancies of chairmen of eight committees, which arose following the retirement of some members of the Rajya Sabha. These vacancies include the posts of chairmen of department-related standing committees on human resource development and industries, held by Dr. Satyanarayan Jatiya and Dr. K. Keshava Rao, respectively. “As for oath taking by the 38 members who were recently elected unopposed, it has been decided that oath will be administered to them inside the chamber of the Rajya Sabha after the lockdown, if feasible before the next session so as to comply with the norm of physical distance, with their family members likely to attend,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-plans-to-save-80-crore-amid-covid-crisis/story-DzGYAy4OvUV1vDoyavdZlO.html
05-05-2020||India||For every 10 Covid-19-related deaths, 90 recoveries, says govt||The ratio of number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases recovering in relation to the number of people dying of the viral infection has improved with the current Union health ministry data showing the outcome ratio to be 90:10. So for every 10 deaths, 90 people have recovered from the disease.“We determine the outcome ratio by analysing our cases that are closed in terms of people in hospitals who recovered proportional to those who died of the infection. This also indicates the clinical management status of a hospital,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, health ministry, adding that the outcome ratio has improved been April 17 and May 4.“On April 17, the ratio was 80:20, wherein 80 people had been discharged after recovery and 20 patients could not make it. The current outcome ratio, however, has improved and stands at 90:10,” he added.On Monday, the country also reported the highest number of recovered patients to date.“A total of 1,074 patients have recovered in the past 24 hours, which is the highest to date, taking the total number of patients cured of Covid-19 in the country to 11706. It has also improved India’s recovery rate that now stands at 27.52%,” he said.With 2,553 new Covid-19 cases reported in the past 24 hours, the total number of infected patients in the country is 42533, with 1389 deaths, according to the health ministry’s data (which lags the data in the HT dashboard).“So far we have been fortunate that India has not seen an exponential growth in cases like other affected countries. However, people need to be extra careful now that the lockdown is being eased in a staggered manner, so as to not throw away the gains made. The focus will continue to remain on rigorous containment measures in areas from where maximum cases are being reported and strictly implementing infection control practices,” said Agarwal.The health ministry has urged people to wear masks or a face cover when stepping out, and to scrupulously follow physical distancing.Implementing total lockdown has yielded results in the form of significant improvement in India’s case doubling rate that before lockdown stood at about 3.4 days and is now almost 12 days.The testing capacity has also been ramped up to meet the demand by increasing the number of labs to 426 (315 in the government sector and 111 in the private sector) and increasing sampling. “As on May 3 we have done more than a million tests for Covid-19, and 77,474 in a day. There is no shortage of testing kits or any other material in the country; all those who need to be tested are being tested,” Agarwal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-every-10-deaths-90-recoveries-govt/story-FPTHDJFaVLpkLZaXdTFe6J.html
05-05-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Govt charts mitigation plan in case containment strategy fails||The Union health ministry is creating a mitigation plan for the scenario when the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak cannot be contained, putting together a standard operating procedure (SOP) that focuses on treating the most vulnerable and critical patients in order to reduce deaths. Mentions of a mitigation plan were first made in the government’s containment guidelines for large outbreaks released last month, when officials said the strategy will be in case the number of infections grows to such levels that containment strategies are ineffective – a scenario seen in New York, and parts of Italy and Spain. “The mitigation plan is usually put in place in an extreme situation when all containment measures seem to be failing, and the spread of infection cannot be effectively controlled. In such a situation the focus shifts on reducing mortality and morbidity, which means the measures are drafted and implemented to reduce the number of deaths due to the disease and to work towards ensuring the disease doesn’t progress to its severe level and fewer people need intensive care,” said a senior government official aware of the strategy, asking not to be named. As part of a standard protocol, the focus of such a plan usually is on upgrading health infrastructure, adding more intensive care unit (ICU) beds, increasing ventilators and improving oxygen support mechanisms, and increasing testing capacity. “…if the containment plan is not able to contain the outbreak and large numbers of cases start appearing, then a decision will need to be taken by state administration to abandon the containment plan and start on mitigation activities,” the centre had said in the containment plan released last month.The strategy will be an extension of India’s Covid-19 Emergency Response and Health Systems, which was being prepared by experts from the health ministry, to “respond to and mitigate the Covid-19’s threat and strengthen national systems for public health preparedness”.The plan includes revamping hospitals for air borne infection control; improving facilities handling infectious diseases and equipping district hospitals with single occupancy airborne infection isolation rooms (also called negative-pressure isolation rooms) to prevent spread of infections from and between patients.“Some of it may take time but currently what we are attempting is to ensure quick measures that would be more effective in aiding recovery of patients so that there’s less mortality and morbidity due to the infection,” said the official.The Union government has also constituted and rushed 20 public health teams that will work at the ground level in 20 districts with the highest cases. These include Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Delhi (South East and central districts), Indore, Bhopal, Chennai, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Agra, Lucknow, Kolkata, Kurnool, Guntur and Krishna.Experts say mitigation plan is technically a part of the overarching containment plan.“It shouldn’t be seen as an exclusive plan as purpose of having a containment strategy in place is also to mitigate or reduce the risks associated with the disease outbreak. However, if despite the containment plan, cases spread to other areas, then one has to move out of containment zone and towards peripheral areas to control the spread,” said Dr LS Chauhan, former head, National Centre for Disease Control. “And in the containment zone from where there is excess case load, the focus has to shift towards extensive case management as merely detecting all cases won’t be enough. If you are able to successfully trace and treat all positives then next step is to plan for adequate treatment so that fewer lives are lost,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-charts-mitigation-plan-in-case-containment-strategy-fails/story-viw8kuvJlQBv70yUdju8jJ.html
05-05-2020||India||UPSC postpones civil service prelims exam||The Union Public Service Commission has taken a decision to postpone the civil services preliminary exam “until further notice”. The exam was scheduled to be held on May 31. According to officials in the UPSC, a call will be taken on the new date after “assessment” by May 20. A meeting of the Commission, chaired byUPSC chairman, Arvind Saxena, was held on Monday to take the call to defer the exam with senior UPSC officials. The decision comes after the Central government extended the lockdown for two weeks starting May 4.“UPSC has done what needed to be done,” said an official privy to the developments. “In the current scenario, where Covid-19 is spreading, it is not feasible to hold such a large scale exam.” The Commission, the official added, has not taken a call on a fresh date for the prelims. “The date will be decided in due course of time after evaluating the situation,” the official added.“The decision has been taken keeping mind the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown restrictions,” a second UPSC official told Hindustan Times. “A fresh date will be announced after May 20.”“From inaccessibility of exam venues during lockdown as schools had been turned into quarantine centres, to ensuring students had enough time to book tickets to reach the centres, the UPSC had to address a host to issues to be able to hold the exam on May 31. It would have been very difficult ,” said the second official. The Commission was due to release admit cards for the students this week, but has decided to defer the process in view of the current crisis. Nearly 10 lakh people register for the civil services preliminary examination every year. Nearly 1.6 lakh functionaries participate in conducting the exam across 2,500 centres. Many other premier exams, such as the Haryana Civil Services, which was slated to be held from June 5, have also been postponed. Former UPSC chairman, Vijay Singh, said that the decision may delay the recruitment process a little but it is not worrisome. “We have to keep in mind not everything has been postponed as of yet,” said Singh. “The preliminary exam is a huge exercise carried out in a number of centres. The logistics are vast and expansive with people involved across the country. UPSC can’t afford for anything to go wrong, it has to maintain its reputation and the exam has to be conducted in a way that no doubts are raised about it.”“All that may happen is that the recruitment process may be a little delayed but that’s not a really big deal,” he added. But the lack of clarity regarding a new date brings a new set of anxieties for aspirants who believe that the preparation time for the main examination may be reduced. “The uncertainty is worrisome, but, at the same time, I am hoping for positives since it will give aspirants more time to study,” said UPSC aspirant, Snigdha Talapatra, 25, who will be writing her second attempt. “It’s probably going to happen in August or September. I sincerely hope we will not be given lesser time to prepare for the Mains. Studying for prelims also entails studying for Mains for most us, though.” There is usually a three month gap between the civil services preliminary and main examination. Last year, the preliminary exam was held on June 3, while the main examination, that usually lasts a week, started on September 20. “The situation is so dire that the decision to postpone the exam was inevitable,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upsc-postpones-civil-service-prelims-exam/story-jc2x5EtRniH7BwN9S3vBEI.html
05-05-2020||India||At NAM meet, PM Modi calls for new order of globalisation||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis has exposed the limitations of the existing international system and the world needs a new framework of globalisation and international institutions that are more representative, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday.Addressing a summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) for the first time since he assumed office in 2014, Modi said efforts to promote human welfare will have to go side by side with measures for economic growth in a post-Covid-9 world order.Modi, who has pushed efforts to organise a coordinated response to the Covid-19 pandemic in the region and beyond by organising a video conference of leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) and joining a special summit of the G20, skipped the last two NAM summits in 2016 and 2019.In line with his addresses at multilateral meetings held after the Covid-19 crisis began, Modi’s speech at Monday’s video conference too focused on the need to fashion a new world order after the pandemic. NAM, he said, can promote global solidarity at a time when humanity is facing its most serious crisis in many decades.“Covid-19 has shown us the limitations of the existing international system. In the post-Covid world, we need a new template of globalisation based on fairness, equality and humanity. We need international institutions that are more representative of today’s world, we need to promote human welfare and not focus on economic growth alone,” Modi said.India has backed initiatives to help fashion a better world order, such as the International Solar Alliance to “help our planet heal from the disease of climate change”, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure to “protect ourselves against climate and disaster risks”, and the International Day of Yoga, he added.Without naming any country, Modi also said: “Even as the world fights Covid-19, some people are busy spreading other deadly viruses such as terrorism, fake news and doctored videos to divide communities and countries.”Amid the Covid-19 crisis, he said, India has shown “how democracy, discipline and decisiveness can come together to create a genuine people’s movement”. India has helped other countries to counter Covid-19 and promoted coordination in its immediate neighbourhood, he said.“India is regarded as a pharmacy of the world, especially for affordable medicines. Despite our own needs, we have ensured medical supplies to over 123 partner countries, including 59 members of NAM,” Modi said. India has also organised online training to share its medical expertise with others and is active in global efforts to develop remedies and vaccines.“Many countries organise military drills but India had taken the initiative to organise disaster management drills in our region and beyond. NAM should call upon the international community and the World Health Organization to focus on building health capacity in developing countries,” he said.The NAM should also ensure equitable, affordable and timely access to health products and technology and develop a platform where all member countries can pool their best practices, crisis management protocols, research and resources, he added.“In the founding spirit of the movement, let us aim today to come together, not grow apart… Let us work as partners towards an inclusive and cooperative global response,” Modi said.India played a major role in the establishment of NAM in 1961 but in recent years, the organisation of 120 developing countries has not been a key part of New Delhi’s multilateral diplomatic initiatives. India continues to have robust ties with key members of NAM from Asia, Africa and the Arab world but New Delhi’s decision not to join the organisation’s summits at the level of the prime minister after 2012 reflected the rebalancing of diplomatic equations.Azerbaijan, the current chair of NAM, organised the virtual summit on Monday to forge a united response to the Covid-19 pandemic. It said the summit was aimed at mobilising NAM member states to fight Covid-19 and to strengthen multilateralism.More than 30 heads of state and government and other leaders from Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean joined Monday’s meeting, which was also addressed by UN General Assembly president Tijjani Muhammed Bande, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, EU high representative Josep Borrell and WHO director general Tedros Ghebreyesus.The NAM leaders identified requirements for remedies and called for action-oriented follow-up measures. Following the summit, the leaders adopted a declaration underlining the importance of global solidarity in the fight against Covid-19, and announced the creation of a task force to identify the requirements of member states in terms of medical, social and humanitarian needs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-nam-meet-pm-calls-for-new-order-of-globalisation/story-xTKPZQ80ufhC5FLrc2FVBL.html
05-05-2020||India||Teething troubles mark Day 1 as Covid-19 lockdown enters new phase||Scenes of chaos outside liquor stores that opened after 40 days, confusion over the reopening of other commercial establishments, the return of traffic, albeit thin, onto the roads and a small section of office-goers braving it back to work -- that just about summarises how the first day of lockdown 3.0 went on Monday.A semblance of normality returned for the first time since March 25, when the lockdown took hold, as the central and state governments loosened some of the tough restrictions they put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19. The loosening of the curbs is part of a a government strategy aimed at a graded lifting of the world’s biggest lockdown.The government has allowed the resumption of standalone stores, neighbourhood shops and outlets in residential complexes to reopen for business. The central government has also allowed private offices with up to 33% staff strength and private vehicles with two persons besides the driver even in urban areas classified as red zones Standalone liquor shops have been allowed to open in all three zones — red, orange and green — in the country subject to the condition that strict social-distancing rules are observed. These shops are, however, not allowed in containment zones.From West Bengal to Rajasthan and Karnataka to Uttar Pradesh, law enforcement officials faced a tough challenge on Monday in controlling crowds and maintaining social distancing in front of liquor shops.Extraordinary scenes were seen across Indian cities where people formed serpentine queues, waited for hours and jostled with each other to reach the sales counters. Many celebrated by lighting the traditional lamp and incense sticks.Such was the rush in Kolkata that most shops had to down their shutters hours after opening for business. “The government will not allow violation of social distancing norms outside liquor stores,” chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said at the state secretariat in the afternoon.In Rajasthan, which too closed some shops as the day progressed, people formed long queues. “What to do, sir? This day has come after a long wait,” said Shyam Sundar Sharma, a consumer waiting for his turn. Sanjay Bhoosreddy, the principal secretary of the excise department in Uttar Pradesh, said: “There is an estimate that on the first day itself, the government is likely to earn Rs 100 crore as revenue.” In India’s most populous state, officials in some places put in place a “one bottle, one person” limit. “We want our alcohol at any cost,” said Sooraj Pawar from Mumbai’s suburb Santacruz. In the morning, confusion prevailed in Mumbai over the opening of liquor shops with traders waiting for the final word from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which gave its go-ahead in the afternoon. Liquor shops in Mumbai and Mumbai Suburban opened after that.Some states such as Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana kept liquor shops closed. So did Puducherry.The Tamil Nadu government announced the resumption of liquor sales from May 7. The decision to open state-run retail outlets was taken after people in districts bordering Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh started making a beeline to liquor stores there, posing a challenge in controlling interstate movement, the government said in a statement.Shops in Madhya Pradesh will reopen on Tuesday, excluding Bhopal, Indore and Ujjain — all under the red zone.Also on Monday, with area-specific relaxations coming into force, several manufacturing firms across auto, textiles, breweries and fertilizers segments resumed operations. But some retailers complained of chaos due to different interpretation of orders by local authorities.Traders’ body CAIT (The Confederation of All India Traders) said just 20% of its member shops in permitted categories could open in different states due to confusion and lack of clarity over interpretation of neighbourhood shops and standalone shops at the local level.CAIT secretary general Praveen Khandelwal said: “In states like Punjab and Uttarakhand, over 50% shops were allowed to open but in many states either the shops could not open or those which opened were asked to close down by the local authorities.”The country’s largest two-wheeler maker, Hero MotoCorp, said it resumed operations in a graded manner across three of its manufacturing plants in Gurugram, Dharuhera (both in Haryana) and Haridwar (Uttarakhand), with actual product rollout expected to begin from Wednesday.Commercial vehicle maker SML Isuzu said it received permission from the Punjab government to start its manufacturing plant situated in district Shahid Bhagat Singh Nagar, but emphasised that the “work from home policy” will continue.In line with the federal guidelines, the West Bengal government said private buses are allowed intra-district travel with 20 passengers in green zones, while standalone shops will be allowed to open in all zones.Business activities and movement of people resumed mainly in green and orange zones of Odisha as the state government considerably relaxed the lockdown curbs. The situation remained largely unchanged in the “red zones” where roads were deserted look.In Assam, a police patrol party was attacked by a group of people while enforcing curfew as part of the lockdown. An officer in Sonitpur district was injured.In Uttar Pradesh, long queues were seen at banks, though many private offices were closed. Haldwani in Uttarakhand’s Nainital district reported traffic jams in the first half of the day with people coming out on their two-wheelers and four-wheelers to visit markets. Small traffic jams were seen in Bengaluru as well. While Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol expressed his disapproval of the decision to give relaxations in non-containment zones in the city, Chandigarh administrator VP Singh Badnore said it was necessary to ease lockdown restrictions in the Union territory.“After 41 days of the lockdown, it was necessary to ease out restrictions for bringing the economy on track and also for giving relief to daily (wage) earners. Hence, as per guidelines of home ministry, the Chandigarh administration provided certain exemptions in the lockout,” Badnore said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/teething-troubles-mark-day-1-as-covid-lockdown-enters-new-phase/story-fcZ4Q6h7buAR0CMdW3bqxN.html
05-05-2020||India||TMC govt says it has retrieved ‘missing’ Covid-19 data, admits to gaps||On a day the inter-ministerial central team sent a letter to the state government questioning mismatch in its data related to Covid-19, the Mamata Banerjee-administration claimed to have found all missing data, even while admitting that there were gaps in data that was being released every day. “There was an issue of missing data which is why there were some gaps. All missing data have been retrieved. Now we are in a position to share all this data every day,” Rajiva Sinha, chief secretary of West Bengal said on Monday.A major controversy erupted after state health secretary Vivek Kumar’s letter to union health secretary Preeti Sudan put the total number of persons who tested positive for Covid-19 in the state at 931 as of April 30, whereas the data shared with journalists gave the number 816.However, the data shared by the state on Monday supports neither figure. The government said that the total number of patients testing positive stood at 1,259 on Monday, with 229 new cases between May 1 and May 4, which put the April 30 number at 1,030.“There were gaps in data which was triggering confusion. We found that the data reporting structure was highly complicated and some data was not being registered at all. It was not deliberate. We have improved. We searched all data over the weekend and compiled everything so that there is no missing data,” Sinha added.As a result, while the state government’s data and so long shown fewer number of cases than in the data shared by the union health ministry, the Monday number was well above what was shared by union health ministry.The state government on Monday said of the total 1,259 total cases, 908 were active cases, 218 persons have recovered and been discharged from hospitals, 61 persons died of Covid-19 and another 72 died of co-morbidity. “Bengal is turning out to be India’s Covid-19 hub. The state government’s mismanagement led to this situation. Without IMCT’s interventions, we would have never known the real picture regarding the number of deaths and persons infected,” BJP state unit president Dilip Ghosh alleged on Monday.The IMCT for south Bengal, before leaving the state for Delhi, sent a letter to the chief secretary on Monday accusing the state of fudging Covid-19 related data and suppressing facts. The team, which was in Bengal since April 20, will submit its report to the ministry of home affairs soon. The number of containment zones in the state has shot up from 444 on April 30 to 516 on May 4. Kolkata, with 318 such areas, has the highest number of containment zones.Meanwhile the bulletin published by the state on Monday showed that only four districts have been tagged as Red Zones in Bengal. On April 30, the union health ministry released a list which said that Bengal has 10 Red Zones.The state’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) targeted the BJP for politicising an administrative issue. On social media, Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and TMC youth wing chief Abhishek Banerjee wrote, “In their desperation to score cheap political points, those who are misrepresenting facts and maligning Bengal even daring to call Bengal - ‘Wuhan of India’ should look at facts: % +ve per million: 14, rank 16th, Total Cases: 1259, rank 9th, Active cases: 908, rank 10th.” The ranks refer to the state’s standing nationally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-govt-says-it-has-retrieved-missing-data-admits-to-gaps/story-DaVR5zNHra5xrwehmTwZ6L.html
05-05-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Migrant workers throng MP borders in bid to return home||Thousands of labourers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have gathered along Madhya Pradesh’s borders with Gujarat and Maharasthra as they seek to return to their states even as inter-state borders remained closed as part of the national lockdown imposed to check the Covid-19 spread, multiple officials said on Monday.The officials said about 8,000 people, including women and children, have gathered at Bijasan in Barwani along the state’s border with Maharashtra and over 5000 at Pitol in Jhabua that borders Gujarat since Saturday as they were not allowed to enter Madhya Pradesh. Similarly, thousands of labourers gathered at Johariya in Datia district along the Madhya Pradesh-Uttar Pradesh border as it remained closed.Rohit, a labourer from Uttar Pradesh’s Faridpur stranded along the Gujarat border, said their group reached Pitol on Sunday. “We want to go to Uttar Pradesh. The officials here say [chief minister] Yogi [Yogi Adityanath] does not want us to enter Uttar Pradesh. The authorities are opening and closing the border. There is no food and water for us since yesterday [Sunday]. There should be prior information when they are going to close or open the border.”Arvind Kumar from Uttar Pradesh’s Pratapgarh said people from Madhya Pradesh were being allowed to enter the state while they were not.Datia collector Rohit Singh said a number of labourers were allowed to get in but then the border was closed from the Uttar Pradesh side.Madhya Pradesh police chief Vivek Johri said they have no problem in allowing people to enter the state but Uttar Pradesh has to allow them.The Barwani administration arranged 200 buses for labourers to go to Uttar Pradesh on Thursday and Friday but they were stuck in Datia as the border remained closed. An official said this is why they did not allow further movement of people.State governments have been scrambling to arrange buses and trains to send migrant workers home after the Centre made an exception for people stranded because of the lockdown and allowed them to travel. Vishwadeep Singh Parihar, a police inspector in Barwani, said there are pregnant women and couples with kids among the stranded people. “Hence, the administration has decided to arrange transport for such people to send them to the Uttar Pradesh border so that they do not have any problem in staying here and could reach their homes early whenever the border is opened for them.” A police sub-inspector and two constables were injured on Sunday when angry labourers in Barwani threw stones at police personnel when they were not allowed to enter Madhya Pradesh.Another official said even though the administration arranged food for labourers at Bijasan, their numbers have swelled and made the arrangements inadequate. “We had not anticipated that Uttar Pradesh will close its borders. Even otherwise it is not possible to provide basic facilities for the stay and food for such a large number of people that too while ensuring social distancing.”Activists Medha Patkar said people are coming even as the mercury has shot up to 42 degree Celsius using various modes of transport and even barefooted but no one is taking care of them whether it is the Centre or state governments of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Mahrashtra and Gujarat. The lockdown was imposed first in March and triggered an exodus of jobless migrant workers from big cities. Many of them left for their homes on foot and forced the Centre to ask the states to seal their borders and take care of the workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-workers-throng-mp-borders-in-bid-to-return-home/story-RrC1FfnWTm9v7UUgXGwdCO.html
05-05-2020||India||Centre review team pulls up Bengal over ‘discrepancies’ in Covid-19 data||An inter-ministerial central team (IMCT) sent to assess West Bengal’s response to Covid-19 has alleged discrepancies in the number of cases reported by the state, pointed to its high mortality rate, and questioned the state government’s claim of having surveyed five million people.The team has detailed these alleged discrepancies in its final observations submitted to the West Bengal government on Monday. HT has accessed a copy of the observations. The Union sent two IMCTs to West Bengal on April 20 -- one to do on spot assessment in Kolkata, Howrah, Midnapure and 24 North Paragnas and other was sent to Jalpaiguri, Kalimpong and Darjeeling. The state and the Centre have exchanged words over the teams, the availability of testing kits, and alleged gaps in West Bengal’s response to Covid-19. Last week, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee accused the Centre of maligning the state and spreading “canards” about its testing figures when the “real problem” was with the testing kits supplied. She lashed out at the two central teams for calling officers indiscriminately and hampering the fight against Covid-19. BJP has alleged that Mamata Banerjee has not provided enough protection to the medics and Centre’s relief ration is not reaching intended beneficiaries in the state. The teams have complained that they did not get enough support from the state government, said an IMCT member. Complaints of one IMCT are out in public domain. In its observations, the first team cited the state’s April 30 medical bulletin, saying it reported 572 active cases and said that 139 patients were discharged after treatment while 33 died of the disease, making a total of 744. “In a communication to Union health secretary on the same day, the total number of cases was indicated to be 931, leading to a discrepancy of 187 cases,” the team said. It added the state classified 72 fatalities on April 30 due to Covid-19 as deaths due to co-morbidities. “The bulletin of May 1 and 2 does not even mention the total number of cases and deaths...” it said.The team questioned the state’s claims of high daily surveillance in containment zones. “During the stay of the committee itself, over 50 lakh (five million) persons would have been surveyed in the four districts. Collating and evaluating a database of this magnitude requires very robust systems to be in place. However, no such evidence was available during our stay or field visits,” noted the IMCT leader Apruva Chandra in the observations.The IMCT notes that the state government has on April 30 made a pronouncement that henceforth all deaths of Covid patients would be indicated in the daily statistics and the death certificate would be issued by the hospital with the Committee of Doctors only examining a random sample.” The team called it a big step towards transparency, but said that the state raised the total death count of Covid-19 patients to 105 as on April 30, as per West Bengal chief secretary. “For a total reported number of 744 + 72 = 816 Covid patients, the mortality rate of 12.8% is by far the highest in the country. This extremely high mortality rate is a clear indication of low testing and weak surveillance and tracking.” The national Covid-19 mortality rate as of Monday was 3.24%, with 1,389 deaths for over 42,835 total cases. Responding to the IMCT’s letter dated May 4, chief secretary Rajiva Sinha said, “You (journalists) are getting their letters before these are reaching us. Anyway, we will give them a reply.” An IMCT member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cited the case of a Border Security Force driver, who developed Covid-19 symptoms on May 1 to underline the state’s lax attitude. “He was tested and the result came positive on May 3. But there has been no effort from anyone in the state government to trace the contacts or get his family tested.” The team reiterated its accusation that the West Bengal government has been “antagonistic” towards it and has not supported the IMCT in the performance of its duties. It added this is in contrast with the experience of IMCTs deputed to other states, where top officials attended their meetings.The IMCT, which was due to submit its final report to the Union home ministry on Monday, also asked the West Bengal government to explain the methodology used to ascertain Covid-19 deaths and whether it was in line with the Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines.The state’s ruling party, Trinamool Congress, however, lambasted the IMCT. “Of the 20 teams, three are being sent to Gujarat, Andhra and Maharashtra but only one to Bengal. Two teams are being sent to Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, among others. This itself reflects how Bengal’s situation is better than other states. The IMCT, instead of writing to the state, should have consulted their colleagues in the union home ministry to get the real picture,” said TMC national spokesperson Derek O’Brien.TMC’s Lok Sabha leader Sudip Banerjee, too, took a dig at the IMCT and said, “There is a plan on behalf of the Centre to malign our state. We don’t blame the officers who made the IMCT. They are doing what their political masters are asking them to do. They were sent here not to help the state but to create disturbances.”The Centre has also deputed two inter-ministerial teams each to Gujarat, Telangana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to probe possible lapses in efforts to control Covid-19 and violations of lockdown regulations. Of these, Gujarat and Indore teams have given positive feedback, that of others is not yet known.Inputs by Snigdhendu Bhattacharya||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-review-team-pulls-up-bengal-over-discrepancies-in-covid-data/story-t9YPXMTV0P7c1Z2etkN53J.html
05-05-2020||India||Temperature in May likely to be over 42° C, predicts IMD||The India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s long-range forecast for May indicates most parts of northwest, central and east India will record maximum temperatures of over 42 degrees C in the second, third and fourth week of May.But that may not be the case for northwest India if western disturbances (WDs) continue to affect the region as they have in March and April. There will be several cloudy days and thunderstorm activity, which will keep maximum temperatures down by 2 to 3 degrees, if the current pattern of WDs continues.IMD scientists said the climate models used for long range forecast of seasons cannot account for the impact of WDs, which can significantly alter weather patterns in northwest India and even in other parts of the country depending on their intensity. They are highly unpredictable and are best tracked only three to four days in advance. So summer temperatures over India this year will continue to remain unpredictable.“These models don’t factor in western disturbances. WDs usually affect only the northern part of the country in winter. This time we are seeing some intense WDs even in May, which is unusual. May and June are still there, let’s see how WDs affect the temperature in the rest of summer,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences.Rains over India during the pre-monsoon period from March 1 to May 4 have been 24% excess while over NW India it has been 41% excess and 174% excess over Central India. Such wet conditions over NW India during the pre-monsoon period is unusual. “We are expecting temperatures to be above normal over NW India and normal and slightly above normal over the rest of India. We can’t now talk about the impact of WDs because they can be forecast only three to four days in advance. By May, moisture is expected to reduce over NW India, which then leads to high temperatures but if there is moisture incursion from the Bay of Bengal or Arabian Sea, this will also change,” said DS Pai, senior scientist at IMD Pune. IMD uses statistical and dynamic models with various atmospheric and oceanic parameters to assess seasonal weather patterns.Another IMD scientist who preferred not to be quoted said intense WDs have had an impact all over the country this year. This could not be captured in IMD’s seasonal forecast. “We have had only two to three occasions of heat waves in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. In previous years, heat waves began in early April. The combination of easterly winds, western disturbances, moisture incursion has changed everything. April and early May are cooler than normal,” he said.WDs are low pressure systems that generally originate over the Mediterranean region and are known to bring winter rain in India. Their intensity reduces in summer when they move to upper latitudes.The IMD, in its Monday bulletin, said convergence of moist easterly winds can cause widespread thundershowers over entire northwest India over the next three days.Thundershowers are also likely over Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram. Tripura, sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim during next three or four days. Thundersqualls (50-60 kmph) and hailstorms are also likely over parts of east India.Experts at Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) advised that the elderly will need extra care during extreme summer heat because of the combined threat of Covid-19 and heat stress. “Most people are indoors because of lockdown related restrictions. If power supply is ensured, this summer may be different and better. But due to less pollution, radiation will be high this year. These impacts will have to be studied,” said Abhiyant Tiwari, research associate at Indian Institute of Public Health.The IMD, in its seasonal outlook for March, April, May, and again in an updated outlook for April to June season, had predicted that seasonal average maximum temperatures are likely to be warmer than normal by 0.5 to 1 degree C over northwest India and western peninsular India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-rain-may-likely-to-be-hot/story-G97lEvwFnRVhhZHIKqCu2K.html
05-05-2020||India||In Pakistan’s new script for terrorism in Kashmir, Handwara is the key||A second face-off between security forces and terrorists, not far from the Handwara house in north Kashmir where a bloody firefight killed 5 soldiers, appears to be part of a Pakistan attempt to rewrite the script for terrorism in Kashmir, a top security official told Hindustan Times on Monday evening.Just minutes earlier, two young men had opened fire at CRPF jawans at a security checkpoint when they were busy checking out some movement in the adjoining orchard. Two jawans were killed on the spot, the third succumbed to the gunshots later. A civilian who was caught in the cross-firing also died.The attack is considered brazen not just because of how the terrorists targeted security personnel at a checkpoint, but also the timing.In an overnight operation in another part of Handwara over the weekend, the security establishment had lost four soldiers including the commanding officer of the battalion Colonel Ashutosh Sharma and a police officer. At the end of the 13-hour long operation, two bodies of terrorists were found. One of them was said to be a top Lashkar commander Haider, a Pakistani national.Top intelligence officials told Hindustan Times that they have decided to keep an open mind about the number of terrorists involved in the Handwara encounter and ascertain if this group had recently infiltrated into India.Handwara falls along the infiltration route from the Leepa Valley.Intelligence agencies had earlier pointed to terror launch pads that had been activated in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir’s Dudhnial, Sharda and Athmuqam across the Keran sector on this side of the Line of Control.It was in the Keran sector in early April that a team of army commandos killed the entire infiltrating batch of five terrorists in a close-quarter battle. Five Special Forces commandos had laid down their lives in this operation carried out in heavy snow.Counter-terror operatives said about 25-30 terrorists are believed to have slipped through the security grid along the LoC in April alone.The developments of the last two days appears to indicate, a senior security official said, that Kupwara district, particularly Handwara, would be the hotbed of action this summer.This assessment also matches with intelligence inputs that suggest the Pakistan-backed terrorist groups would focus on north Kashmir. There would be some intermittent attacks elsewhere too, like the grenade that terrorists threw at CISF jawans at a power facility in Budgam. A CISF jawan escaped with some splinter injuries in his leg.Pakistan has for years, tried to give Kashmir terrorism a local face. There was a renewed attempt at this makeover in recent months. According to an assessment presented to national security planners in late April, the ISI had messaged the 100-odd foreign terrorists to lie low and let the local terrorists front the battle with security forces.“Foreign terrorists are seen to be consolidating logistics, expanding the overground workers facilitation network and concentrating on recruitment of Kashmiri youth,” the report accessed by Hindustan Times said. Foreign terrorists had accordingly stepped up efforts to radicalise the youth in the Doda-Kishtwar-Ramban range to prepare them for recruitment.The intelligence brief had also predicted a spike in terror activities and attacks from April, after the starting of Ramzan.“Our assessment is that the next 10-14 days are going to be crucial… very crucial,” a top intelligence official said, alluding to inputs that indicated an effort by terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed to carry out simultaneous suicide attacks targetting army and central paramilitary bases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-pakistan-new-script-for-terrorism-in-kashmir-handwara-is-the-key/story-GdfBJRgJALmvhUD4t0RyDJ.html
05-05-2020||India||Supreme Court reserves order on 4G connectivity in Jammu and Kashmir||The Supreme Court on Monday reserved its order on a raft of petitions challenging restrictions on 4G connectivity in Jammu and Kashmir, where high-speed Internet has been.blocked to prevent terrorists from using it as a communications tool .The petitions filed by the Foundation for Media Professionals and Association of Private Schools in J&K, among others, challenged a decision by the administration to restrict connectivity in the entire Union territory to 2G services. Amid the lockdown for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) which has infected more than 700 people in J&K, it is imperative to restore high-speed internet connectivity, the petitioners argued. This would give doctors access to the latest information on Covid-19, facilitate video consultations with patients in line with social distancing norms, and enable students to log onto online classrooms , the petitions said.Before reserving its order, the bench of justices NV Ramana, SK Kaul and BR Gavai said that on the one hand was the right to health and education of citizens and on the other was the equally pressing concern of national security. The Centre and the J&K administration claimed that any relaxation on restrictions will promote militancy. Attorney general KK Venugopal argued that militancy was on the rise and the courts should not interfere with decisions that are best left to the wisdom of the government.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for J&K, argued that the right to Internet was not a fundamental right and can be restricted. Responding to the claim made n the petitions that 4G was essential in the battle against Covid-19 , Mehta said, “There are other places in the country where there is no internet or only 2G network is available. We have no information yet that someone has died of Covid-19 there as they did not have internet access.” The petitioners, represented by senior advocates Huzefa Ahmadi and Salman Khurshid, said the government must demonstrate a nexus between high-speed internet connectivity and militancy. Ahmadi said that militancy has been around in J&K for a long time and in a lockdown scenario, the right to health of citizens must take precedence. Khurshid submitted that the government could curb the spread of anti-national activities through the internet, but .that should not be made the grounds to deprive the entire J&K of high-speed internet.Article 370 that granted J&K special status was scrapped in August last year and the state was bifurcated into two Union territories, J&K and Ladakh, in moves accompanied by widespread arrests and a communication blockade that lasted several months. In January, the apex court directed the government to review the blockade from time to time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-reserves-order-on-4g-connectivity-in-j-k/story-Cvh1Lks2fIw3qt88vV6WGJ.html
05-05-2020||India||Rajasthan cop readies for return to duty after recovering from Covid-19||Ram Charan Soran, a 28-year-old policeman, was among the first responders ensuring essentials were supplied to the residents so that they do not have to step out when a hard lockdown was imposed in Jaipur’s Covid-19 hotspot of Ramganj to check the spread of the pandemic. He regularly visited the area with teams of health care workers and those distributing food packets. He was also on patrolling duty in Ramganj for some days and worked overtime until April 6 when he developed a mild fever. His worst fears came true four days later when he was tested positive for Covid-19.Soran said he was shocked to know he had contracted the disease but had no option but to come to terms with it. “Now that I was infected, whatever had to happen had happened,” said Soran, who joined the Rajasthan police in 2018. “Some of us went for voluntary testing because we were working in a hotspot area. My report came on April 10...I tested positive,” said Soran. He was discharged from Jaipur’s SMS hospital on April 23 and quarantined the same day after he tested negative for the disease twice. He will be released from a quarantine centre in the city as per protocol on May 7.He said he got up early and did yoga during his hospitalisation. “After that, it was mostly about watching videos on my mobile phone and chatting with friends and family. What else could one do there? Doctors came to check us twice daily,” he said.Soran, who was the first policeman to contract the disease in Jaipur, was more worried about the 15 policemen he stayed with at a barrack, and luckily only one of them contracted the disease. Both of them have since recovered and are looking forward to returning to work once their quarantine period is over. “I want to return to work,” said Soran. He added he was not scared of even returning to Ramganj. “I will perform my duty without fear,” he said. “If my family says anything, I will explain to them also that duty is duty and in whichever area, we have to perform it.”Ramganj had reported 598 out of Jaipur’s 924 Covid-19 cases as of Saturday and since then the area-wise break-up of the cases has been unavailable.Soran said half of Ramganj is under the jurisdiction of his police station and they went there several times for work. Two other policemen, who contracted the disease in Jaipur’s walled city area, have also recovered.Additional police commissioner Ajay Pal Lamba said four policemen tested positive for the virus and three of them have recovered. “We are proud of our men. They are working in the hotspots as well as in other areas without any complaints. The policemen who have recovered will return to duty when they get discharged from the quarantine centres,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-cop-readies-for-return-to-duty-after-recovering-from-covid-19/story-TcAqexfcptzIwoN82SMNqJ.html
05-05-2020||India||Tamil Nadu’s wholesale market shut down amid Covid-19 outbreak||Koyambedu, one of the country’s largest perishable fruit and vegetable wholesale market with over 3000 shops was shut down on Monday after at least 300 of the 527 new cases reported in Tamil Nadu on Monday were linked to it, making it one of the biggest coronavirus hotspots in the state.“We are shutting [Koyambedu] down temporarily till further orders,” a senior official from the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) who did not wish to be named, told Hindustan Times. “We are going to take those people who work there to a quarantine facility. They will be tested, and those found positive will be treated as per standard protocol.” The market premises will be disinfected over the next two days, officials said.The market was already running at a decreased capacity on account of the national lockdown, which was recently extended to May 17. The first case linked to the Koyambedu cluster emerged on April 19.The sudden shutdown will have an effect on the supply of fresh fruit and vegetables in the city of 10.5 million people, wholesalers said. “The officials came here at around 4 pm and ordered the market’s closure without any warning whatsoever. Produce valued at Rs 5 crore is stuck inside the market and 250 trucks with Rs 10 crore worth of vegetables are on their way to Koyambedu. This is not a small roadside operation that we can simply push our carts back home,” said GD Rajasekaran, president, Koyambedu Periyar Market Association.Koyambedu spread over 295 acres, is one of the largest vegetable, flower and fruit market complexes in India. It houses more than 1000 wholesalers and 2000 retail shops. In non-pandemic times, Koyambedu receives nearly 1,500 truckloads of horticultural produce and at least 100,000 visitors, daily. During the lockdown, around 400 trucks visited the market daily.State officials said Monday that 600 people linked to the market would be taken to quarantine facilities — there are four in Chennai — but several others who worked at the market have returned to their villages across Chennai, Kancheepuram, Cuddalore, Tiruvallur and Chengalpattu. Officials said that the total number of workers was unclear at present.“Many people who worked at the market have also returned to their native villages,” the CMDA official said. “We don’t know how many people have returned home. At present, we have about 600 people who we are going to send to quarantine,” he added.The Koyambedu cluster had so far recorded at least 300 cases, including Monday’s cases reported from Villipuram (49) and Perambalur (25). Officials surmise that the number of contacts who will need to be traced would be several times those traced in connection with the Tablighi Jamaat religious conference held in New Delhi in March, from which over 1000 attendees had returned to the state. The conference was a hotspot and several states were involved in tracing the attendees and their contacts to track the spread of the coronavirus infection.CMDA officials said that they had urged traders at Koyambedu to move to another location within the city, as traders in other parts of the state like Trichy and Tirunelveli had done once the lockdown was implemented in March. “It is a private trade so unless they come forward and cooperate we could not do anything. We have been meeting with them regularly, they were simply not interested,” one official told HT.However, wholesalers claimed that there was no communication from the government, let alone alternative arrangements. On April 28, retail traders and fruit sellers from Koyambedu had been relocated to the bus terminus at Madhavaram, a suburb in the city’s northwest. Asking wholesalers to do likewise would be difficult as few open spaces in the city have the capacity to handle 3000 tonnes of vegetables each day, Rajasekaran said. According to government sources, the wholesale market would be relocated to Tirumazhisai, on the western outskirts of the city, about 15 km from Koyambedu. Another point of infection was a barber who owned a salon in Koyambedu, the official pointed out. The barber had come in contact with over 100 customers either at their homes or when they visited his salon. Efforts are on to trace his contacts, as well.The government anticipates a major disruption in supplies for at least the next three days. According to a senior official in the agriculture ministry, the government has asked farmer producer companies (FPC) that already supply about 12 tonnes of vegetables from farms directly to consumers to increase their supplies 10-fold. That according to the official would take care of 60% of the the city’s vegetable demand. However, the capacity of FPCs to scale up deliveries so much at such short notice is doubtful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-s-wholesale-market-shut-down/story-nmYawvUEVwk3VlQrLwVcsL.html
05-05-2020||India||Govt plans to evacuate Indians stranded abroad from May 7||The government will begin repatriating Indians stranded around the world because of the Covid-19 crisis in phases from May 7, using commercial flights and naval warships to bring back hundreds of thousands of citizens.Indian missions around the world have been registering citizens stranded when Covid-19-related travel restrictions were put in place by India and other countries, and those who want to return because they have lost their jobs or to meet their families.A statement issued by the government on Monday said the “facility would be made available on payment-basis” and “travel would begin in a phased manner from May 7”.Anyone wishing to return to India will have to undergo medical screening and only asymptomatic passengers will be allowed to return to the country, the statement said. State governments will make arrangements for testing, quarantine and onward movement of people who return, it added.The government has not given any official figure for the total number of Indians expected to return from across the world though people familiar with developments said it is expected to run into hundreds of thousands. Blue collar workers, including those who have lost jobs in West Asia, such as the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, are expected to be repatriated first, followed by students and Indians who were stranded in other countries for a variety of reasons, the people said on condition of anonymity.At least150,000 Indians have registered to return with the Indian missions in the UAEalone, with almost a quarter of them citing job losses as the reason for returning home, the people said. About 45,000 Indians who benefited from a recent visa amnesty will be brought back from Kuwait, they said.The statement said the government will facilitate the return of Indian nationals “stranded abroad on compelling grounds” and the “travel would be arranged by aircraft and naval ships”. A standard operating protocol (SOP) has been prepared for the repatriation, it said.Indian missions are preparing the list of “distressed Indian citizens” and non-scheduled commercial flights will be arranged for air travel from May 7.“Medical screening of passengers would be done before taking the flight. Only asymptomatic passengers would be allowed to travel. During the journey, all these passengers would have to follow the protocols, such as the health protocols, issued by the ministry of health and the ministry of civil aviation,” the statement said.On reaching their destination in India, travellers will have to register on the Arogya Setu app and undergo another medical screening. “After scrutiny, they will be quarantined for 14 days, either in a hospital or in an institutional quarantine on payment-basis, by the concerned state government,” the statement said.Covid-19 tests will be done on the travellers after 14 days and “further action would be taken according to health protocols”, it said.“State governments are being advised to make arrangements, including for testing, quarantine and onward movement of the returning Indians in their respective states,” it added.The Indian Navy put three of its large warships – INS Jalashwa and two other amphibious vessels – on standby late last month to bring back thousands of Indians, especially from West Asian states, the people said. About a dozen more warships can be pressed into service if needed, they added.After all international flights to India were suspended in March, the government advised thousands of Indians stranded around the world to “stay put” in the face of numerous requests that they be allowed to return. Officials said at the time this was done because authorities were apprehensive about the spread of the coronavirus disease and there weren’t enough quarantine facilities to cope with any sudden influx of thousands of people.Many stranded Indians faced problems in accessing food and accommodation and there were reports of dozens of people roughing it out in airports in cities such as Dubai and Kuala Lumpur. Indian students in many countries faced problems as their universities closed due to the pandemic and they had no accommodation. In London, a group of students camped in the high commission for several days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-to-evacuate-indians-stranded-abroad-from-may-7/story-dpMojrNABfXGhZzOZZUl3J.html
05-05-2020||India||WhatsApp comes up with chatbots for users to check coronavirus facts||Poynter Institute’s International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) has released a chatbot on WhatsApp where people can message and check on fake news claims. Replies from IFCN’s database of debunked fake news will be available to people at +1 (727) 2912606.Baybars Örsek, director at IFCN, Poynter Institute, said the chatbot which is available in English alone, and will be released in Hindi soon. “The service is launching in English but will be available in other languages, including Hindi, Portuguese and Spanish, in due course. We are working to include other languages in due course,” Örsek said. A release from WhatsApp said through the bot, people can check whether a piece of content about Covid-19 has already been rated as false by professional fact checkers. “Since January, more than 80 fact-checking organisations from 74 countries have identified more than 4,000 hoaxes related to the novel coronavirus. All this information now forms the CoronaVirusFacts database and is updated daily by the IFCN so that chatbot users can navigate and easily access its content,” the release said.Örsek said that users can search for these debunked news through the chatbot. “The IFCN bot is primarily a way to distribute fact checks to WhatsApp users and to provide access to a searchable database on coronavirus debunked hoaxes. It allows users to review IFCN’s database of 4,000 debunked myths, to search for fact checks by word or phrase, access to tips to protect themselves from falsehoods, and also to find out how to contact local fact checkers in their country,” he said. Through the bot, a user can access a global directory of fact-checking organisations, and the user’s country is detected from the mobile country code to provide contacts of fact-checking organisations which are closest. “The person can then submit a piece of information for review directly to its local fact checker or visit it,” WhatsApp said in a release. With the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, there is a spike in the volume of fake news, and WhatsApp has been grappling with it, especially in India where it has over 450 million users. As the pandemic spread, the private messaging platform brought in product changes, including reducing the number forwards of a ‘highly forwarded message’ to just one chat. The company says this has brought down virality of messages which has already reduced the number of highly forwarded messages by 70%. Örsek said some of these fake news items were about symptoms of the disease. “The first couple of weeks after the first case was detected outside of China, we have seen so many pieces of misinformation on the spread of the virus and false symptoms. It had been the case especially in Europe, where the virus spread from Italy to Spain and then eventually to the different parts of the world where we saw a big volume of misinformation on the spread of the virus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-comes-up-with-chatbots-for-users-to-check-coronavirus-facts/story-dluORhdVdUa8e76pU6v1TM.html
05-05-2020||India||Covid-19: Tension, impatience stretch in containment zones across states||Azad Nagar in Indore, Ramganj Bazar in Jaipur, Dharavi in Mumbai and Master Plan Road in Agra may be divided by geography, but they have one thing in common. All four neighbourhoods are Covid-19 containment zones, cut off from the rest of their cities, all residents confined indoors and no outsider allowed in.Life wouldn’t have been easy for the residents of these neighbourhoods, which have been under what’s called a hard lockdown -- a state in which a particular area is completely sealed and residents have no freedom of movement -- after a significant number of cases surfaced within their municipal limits.Everyday essentials are home-delivered so that residents don’t need to step out and the heavily barricaded localities are sanitised everyday. They have been isolated in the run-up to and after Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared a three-week nationwide lockdown that took effect on March 25, and has since been extended twice, until May 17.It isn’t easy either for government officials deputed to these areas, classified as highly contagious, who have to spend most of the day visiting homes to trace the contact history of locals,ensure no one is breaching the quarantine, and gathering information about the health of residents that goes into the framing of national policies to combat Covid-19. There have been instances of abuse of officials, some of whom have even been spat at. Mamta Patel, 42, doesn’t let that deter her. A mother of two, Patel is a revenue department official tasked with ensuring compliance with lockdown restrictions in Indore’s Azad Nagar, from where the most number of Covid cases in the Madhya Pradesh city have been reported. Every day, Patel confronts people who exhibit a mixture of fear and apprehension, pain and distrust. She takes each case as a challenge as she goes about doing her duty in what she calls these “tragic times”.“Recently a woman and her three-year-old child tested positive. The woman, who has a three-month-old baby, wanted a family member to come with her to hospital. It took us lot of time and energy to convince her that it will not be possible,” Patel said. There have been instances of women not willing to go to hospital leaving their children behind. “Some who tested positive wanted to remain in home quarantine, which is not possible,” she said.Patel has been on the job since the first case was reported on March 23 from the neighbourhood of 100,000 people, and hasn’t taken a single day’s leave. She is tasked with surveying the area, screening residents, collecting samples, hospitalising positive cases, and following up with recovered patients. “In the beginning, people were hostile. Gradually we won the faith of the people and they are now cooperating,” she said.Patel’s husband, too, is on Covide-19-related duties in Indore. “I am at the locality at 9am every day after finishing work at my house as the maid is not coming in because of Covid,” Patel said. “My children -- one in Class 12 and the other in Class 8 -- often ask me how long this will go on. I assure them that life will be normal soon,” she said.A few hundred kilometers away in Mumbai’s Dharavi, Asia’s biggest slum, Nazish Shaikh, 33, has been attending to Covid-19 patients for over a month with no leave. The health care worker is among 2,500 people deployed in the containment zone. All of them work wearing protective suits in Mumbai’s sweltering weather.Dharavi, a densely-populated slum of 850,000 people, has already recorded 496 Covid-19 cases with 18 deaths. Screening slum dwellers dressed in full personal protective equipment (PPE) kit isn’t easy. People can’t see the faces of health care workers attending to them; it creates trust issues and impedes communication. “With the rising temperatures, walking around in PPE leads to dehydration. And we can’t even drink water in the suit. The N95 masks make it tougher to breathe,” Shaikh said. She works for up to 10 hours daily despite keeping a fast for Ramzan, and has to be extra careful to make sure she doesn’t catch the infection herself because she has to take care of two elderly parents at home. “My parents wait outside the home for me. I don’t even look at them and go directly into the bathroom. Then I take a bath in warm water with Dettol and soak my clothes in detergent in a separate bucket. Only after this do I allow them to come inside. I can’t take risks with their health,” said Shaikh, who has been on duty since March 19. Equally tough is the job of Chaitali Choudhary, 38, a mother of two, who has to convince people suspected of being infected by the Sars-Cov-2 virus to go into and remain in home quarantine. “As many remain asymptomatic, they don’t agree to go for institutional quarantine. Some behave as if they will be put in jail,” she said. Because she interacts with Covid-19 patients daily, she keeps a safe distance from her two children at home. “My parents who live in Nagpur are very worried about us as my husband is also a doctor and deployed to take care of Covid patients,” she said. In Agra’s Master Plan road, RK Dixit, 58, the district malaria officer, has the job of sanitising the locality every day as the head of a 60-member team. “We have been working since mid-March,” Dixit said. Sanitiser is sprayed in target areas and at the quarantine centres.His team hasn’t been spared the frustration of residents, some of whom even spat on them. “There were a few such incidents initially but now locals cooperate,” he said. Dixit said he has never in his career as a health officer seen such fear among people as that inspired by the coronavirus disease. “At the fag end of my career, I have learnt a lot,” said Dixit, who will retire in two yearsAjitabh Sharma, the nodal officer for Ramganj Bazar road in Jaipur, has experienced the pain of people who have been without work and living with the fear of Covid-19 for almost two months . “There is no much pain and anguish, which words cannot explain..More than corona, fear is killing people. This has been the toughest job of my career,” he said. Suresh Kumar, 32, who responsible for distribution of food in the slums in Mumbai, compares the situation to a science fiction movie that is all too real. “The fear on the faces of people is so real,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tension-impatience-stretch-in-containment-zones-across-states/story-3OObXV3dYStE1OOWpE0llI.html
05-05-2020||India||Only 610 cases in 112 aspirational districts, says govt’s empowered panel on Covid-19||Niti Aayog chief Amitabh Kant, who is heading an empowered group to strengthen India’s response to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), said on Monday the government mobilised about 92,000 NGOs and civil society organisations across the country to tackle the crisis, even as the panel’s progress report said the exodus of migrants to their hometowns was an area of concern.Kant presented the progress report of the sixth empowered group, constituted to engage non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other industry and international bodies, at the daily news briefing and said that these groups were working closely with district administrations. The Centre has formed 11 empowered groups comprising senior civil servants to deal with the Covid-19 outbreak and the problems emerging from the public health crisis.“Empowered Group 6 has mobilised over 92,000 NGOs and CSOs, appealing to them to assist state governments and district administrations in identifying hot spots and delivering essential services to the vulnerable, including the homeless, daily wagers and migrant workers,” the Niti Aayog CEO said.Kant also said that 610 Covid-19 cases were so far reported from 112 most backward districts, which are termed as “aspirational districts” by the government. “So far, in those 112 districts, only 610 cases have been reported, which is 2% of the national infections... Of these, six districts have reported the first case after April 21,” he added.The panel’s progress report said: “Major hot spots are Baramulla (62 cases), Nuh (57), Ranchi (55), YSR (55), Kupwara (47) and Jaisalmer (34) it added.”On a question about the state of the economy, the Niti Aayog CEO said that economic activity began picking up in the third phase of the lockdown, which has seen considerable relaxations.The empowered group previously asked all chief secretaries to appoint state-level nodal officers to coordinate with all NGOs and resolve their issues apart from leveraging their resources and networks. “The NGOs were also urged to lift and distribute rice and wheat from the Food Corporation of India’s godowns at the subsidised rate of Rs 21-22 per kg so that no one in the country remains hungry,” Kant said. The sixth empowered group is monitoring and coordinating with NGOs and civil society organisations across 700 districts on real-time basis to fight the spread of Covid-19. It has also engaged with development partners, United Nations agencies, and industry associations in at least 15 meetings.The Niti Aayog has taken steps to ensure that these districts are able to contain the spread of the virus and has actively referred the requirements in testing kits, personal protective equipment and masks to the respective empowered groups for necessary action in order to address supply constraints, the progress report said.The empowered group also engaged organisations such as the Red Cross Society, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Tata Trusts and Piramal Foundation to extend assistance to people across the country.“It is a record of sorts, to harness their strengths and resources, expertise in key social sectors-nutrition, health, sanitation, education, and extensive reach in the community,” a Niti Aayog official said. The group has involved the organisations in identifying hot spots and deputing volunteers; delivering essential services to the vulnerable, including the homeless, daily wage workers, migrants, and urban poor families; and increasing awareness about prevention, social distancing, and isolation. The report added: “A primary area of concern in these times is the mass exodus of migrant labourers from urban hubs of work to their villages. NGOs are coordinating efforts and working closely with the district administrations and state governments so that measures of care, quarantine, and treatment go hand in hand.”In the next phase, the group will mobilise CSOs and NGOs for movement against Covid-19 stigmatisation and in protecting the elderly and senior citizens, Kant said. The UN in India has prepared a Joint Response Plan (JRP) with prevention, treatment and essential supplies as key components.“Skill building of 15,300 trainers, training for 3,951 surveillance/health officers on Integrated Health Information Platform, infection prevention and control training in 890 hospitals, support to ICMR [Indian Council for Medical Research] for testing, strengthening risk communication and community engagement capabilities of health care workers, procurement of 200,000 PPE kits and 400,000 N95 masks, have been initiated by WHO and UNICEF,” the report said. The empowered group has also urged all organisations and industry partners to effectively utilise the Arogya Setu app in their operations. The application enables people to assess the risk of exposure to Covid-19 infection based on their interaction with others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-610-cases-in-112-aspirational-districts-says-govt-s-empowered-panel-on-covid-19/story-PqqfiGdpj2gzp9jI3IgGOI.html
05-05-2020||India||India a step closer to making key drug to treat Covid-19||The Hyderabad based Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) has synthesised the key starting materials (KSMs) for Remdesivir, the first step to develop the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a drug.IICT has also begun so-called technology demonstrations for drug manufacturers such as Cipla so that manufacturing can begin in India, if needed. Remdesivir, manufactured by Gilead Sciences, is the first drug to treat Covid-19 approved for emergency use in the US based on clinical data . Gilead Sciences has a patent on the drug but patent laws allow for the drug to be developed solely for research purposes and not for commercial manufacturing. Remdesivir, when administered by an intravenous infusion helped patients recover on an average in 11 days, compared to 15 days taken by those on placebo according to US clinical trial results.India is part of the World Health Organisation’s Solidarity Trials for the cure of Covid-19 and has received 1000 doses of the drug for testing. Harsh Vardhan, science and technology and health minister said in a statement on Monday that synthesis of KSMs has been achieved by CSIR-IICT and that technology demonstrations to Indian industry are happening. For Favipiravir, another promising drug to treat Covid19, CSIR is working with the private sector for clinical trials and a possible launch in India. Remdesivir has three KSMs, Pyrrole, Furan and a Phosphate intermediate. Dr Srivari Chandrasekhar, director of IICT said over phone from Hyderabad that synthesis of KSMs is an important stage in drug development.“The synthesis of key starting materials (KSM) for any drug is the first step to develop an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). These key starting materials for Remdesivir are available in India and chemical companies can manufacture these. Other reagents can be sourced from other countries. We started working on KSM for Remdesivir in January end, when trials had begun in China,” he said.Gilead Sciences CEO, Daniel O’ Day in an open letter on April 29 said: “On the supply side, we are working to build a global consortium of pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturers to expand global capacity and production. It will be essential for countries to work together to create enough supply for people all over the world and we look forward to these collaborative efforts.”Experts said the Indian government could request Gilead Sciences for grant of voluntary licenses to Indian private companies for a royalty. If not, India could use the compulsory licence option, under which it, or a generics manufacturer can manufacture patented drugs so as to protect the health of its citizens. The patent hlder, however, gets paid for this. “Because it is a patented drug, there are two options. One is that manufacturers obtain permission from the patent holder for a license to manufacture. The other option is that the Indian government allows two to three manufacturers to manufacture the drug on a compulsory license or a government use license. The manufacturers will need regulatory clearances which will be available only when more clinical data is available on the efficacy of the drug,” said KM Gopakumar, an intellectual property rights expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-a-step-closer-to-making-key-drug/story-mVleP51rCdJUPQgU2UtCLK.html

Besides this, the Cabinet approved ration for the month of May to 38 lakh non-PDS cardholders. The Cabinet also decided to extend its existing scheme of providing one-time financial assistance of Rs 5,000 to every permit holder of para-transit vehicle in Delhi as well as owners of e-rickshaws registered in Delhi. Earlier the scheme was limited to only those drivers of para-transit vehicles who have PSV badge.“With this decision, more than 60,000 permit holders of para-transit vehicles and owners of e-rickshaws registered in Delhi, shall be benefitted,” the government said in a press statement.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal chaired the first Cabinet meeting after the opening of government offices, as part of new lockdown guidelines effective from May 3, on Monday. Among other major decisions taken was regarding approval of the process of home isolation of mild and asymptomatic Covid-19 positive patients.“A training manual has been designed which will be given to all patients and their caregivers. A team of health workers will call each patient personally, and educate them on best practices for home isolation. This will be followed by a daily call that will track all the important vitals of the patient and answer all their queries. The patients would also get automatic SMS alerts for patients testing to be done after 14 days of isolation,” the statement said.Decisions regarding ex-gratia and ration for non-PDS cardholders were already announced by the government but had been awaiting Cabinet nod due to lockdown amid coronavirus pandemic.The government said that 38 lakh non-PDS cardholders, who registered for ration e-coupons through an online process, will be given ration. In April also the government had distributed ration to non-PDS cardholders. “Each individual will be given 4kg wheat and 1 kg rice, and every family will receive the Corona Relief kit that is being given to PDS cardholders. The Corona relief kit consists of 1 litre of refined oil, 1kg Chhole chana, 1kg sugar, 1kg salt, 200gm Haldi powder, 200gm Dhania powder, 200gms chili powder and 2 bars of soap,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-cabinet-approved-rs-1crore-for-family-of-ib-staffer-who-died-in-february-riots/story-0KSPIwaessCltcnA28v0RP.html
05-05-2020||India||Forest panel to share its views on Arunachal hydropower project||Minutes of an April 23 meeting of the environment ministry’s forest advisory committee (FAC) , in which it considered giving forest clearance to the contentious, 3097-megawatt Etalin hydropower project in Arunachal Pradesh’s Dibang Valley, will be made public this week, senior ministry officials said.But the officials said the FAC hadn’t yet taken a decision on whether to reject or allow the project, which conservationists say entails felling tens of thousands of trees and poses a threat to the region’s rich biodiversity.The environment ministry’s forest division has been swamped in the past week by letters and submissions on the project, to make way for which at least 270,000 trees will be felled. After several conservationists and researchers wrote to FAC about the risk of losing a significant tiger habitat and biodiversity-rich sub-tropical evergreen and rainforests, the Idu Mishmi community of Dibang valley has also started petitioning the FAC.“We have received some letters which are in favour of the project and some which are not. We plan to release the minutes of our discussion in FAC meeting next week but a decision is still not taken. We require more information. We will address the concerns raised by scientists and conservationists at an appropriate time,” said Sanjay Kumar, director general of forests.Among several petitions received by the ministry, the Project Affected People Forum, which groups residents of the valley near Tangon and Dri tributaries of Dibang river, where concrete gravity dams will be constructed, also wrote to the ministry. The petition said scientists and researchers with “anti-development mindset” are trying to sabotage the project by running a signature campaign against it.Members of the forum said the project will be critical for the remote region which has been neglected by the government. “There are no basic services like proper health-care services, schools here. When the project comes up people will get jobs. This is a very remote area. The project is also important for Arunachal Pradesh which has no source of revenue generation. There are no big industries here. China across the border has already built several dams on the rivers,” Rohit Mele, chief advisor of the forum, said over phone.More importantly, 250 families have been assured compensation under the land acquisition act which hasn’t come through yet. “Land acquisition has been completed and detailed project report made. All technical formalities are over except forest clearance and environmental clearance. These families are waiting for compensation,” added Mele, who said the project developers had assured the forum that it will have no major environmental or biodiversity impact.The project has been proposed by Etalin Hydro Electric Power Company Limited, a joint venture of Hydro Power Development Corporation of Arunachal Pradesh Limited and Jindal Power Limited HT wrote to Jindal Power Limited on April 29 for a response to the ecological concerns, but the company hasn’t responded to the yet.According to FAC’s own factsheet, the project falls under the richest bio-geographical province of the Himalayan zone and one of the mega biodiversity hotspots of the world. The proposed project location falls at the junction of the Paleoarctic, Indo-Chinese, and Indo-Malayan biogeographic regions having luxuriant forests and plethora of flora and fauna. It is also a “vital tiger area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forest-panel-to-share-its-views-on-arunachal-hydropower-project/story-sbyP6hSBZVcP6wn5IMlKhM.html
05-05-2020||India||‘Pakistan groups trying to send 200 terrorists’||Pakistan-based groups have activated their launch pads along the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir and the International Border (IB) in Jammu in an attempt to send across more than 200 terrorists at a time when the Indian security forces are busy helping the region’s civil administration to fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, according officials familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. Around 160 terrorists of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) are ready to infiltrate into the Valley, according to intelligence inputs available to national security planners. In the Jammu sector, along the border, around 70 armed and trained terrorists are planning to sneak into the Indian territory through unfenced nullahs, the inputs added. Counter-terror operatives said Jaish terrorists were camping at Samani-Bhimber and Dhudhnial launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. LeT has been sending its terrorists to the Leepa and Kel launching pads in Leepa Valley and Neelum Valley, respectively.Indian security agency officials said that, as part of its plan to intensify infiltration efforts and terror attacks in J&K, the Jaish has been mobilising its cadre across the IB in the Sialkot sector since February. Intelligence inputs also reveal that a group of armed Jaish terrorists arrived in Mundeke village, Daska Tehsil, in Sialkot district on February 11, 2020. There were 133 successful infiltration events along the LoC/IB in 2019 with majority of the crossovers taking place between April and September 2019, according to home ministry official. During January-February 2020, the Indian security forces managed to arrest 48 jihadists and overground workers of terror groups, and neutralised 24 terrorists, including three foreign nationals.The April 5 encounter in the Keran sector, in which five terrorists were killed in a close-quarters battle, revealed that the LeT had big plans to infiltrate from the Kupwara sector, according to investigators. Five elite Indian commandos also died in the operation.The LOC/IB infiltration takes place in different sectors: Gurez, Machchil, Keran, Tangdhar, Naugam and Uri in Kashmir; Poonch, Krishnaghati, Bhimber Gali, Sunderbani and Naushera in the Rajouri sector; and Jourian, Hira Nagar, Kathua, Samba and Jammu in the Jammu sector.While the main outfits involved in the infiltration are Jaish, Lashkar and Hizbul, there are indications, security official said, that the Rawalpindi GHQ wants to revive the Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami (Huji) in Sialkot, Punjab and Kotli regions of PoK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-groups-trying-to-send-200-terrorists/story-8L2qwLkWH4Hw6rBgS2w1sJ.html
05-05-2020||Editorials||Dealing with India’s drinking| HT Editorial||On the first day of India’s third phase of the lockdown — where substantial relaxations were introduced — there was a degree of chaos. And nothing symbolised this more starkly than the long queues, the rush, the jostling, and the quarrels in front of liquor shops. It almost appeared that after 40 days, India was ready to party. However, the violation in social distancing norms worried governments considerably. Indeed, it opens up the possibility of a greater spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and squandering away of the gains made so far.There have been a variety of responses to this chaos. But the sharpest came from the Delhi government. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, rightly, issued a warning that if violations continued, he will have to reintroduce restrictions. On Monday night, the government also imposed an extra 70% corona(virus) tax on liquor. Andhra Pradesh has hiked liquor prices by 75%. One may, intuitively, think of this as a wise measure. Governments aim to meet two objectives with higher prices. The first is to disincentivise people from lining up and purchasing alcohol, and thus controlling crowds. The second, at a time when state public finances are under great strain, is to ramp up extra revenues.But this is a mistake. One, there is a clear class bias in the decision because making alcohol expensive is unfair on the poor, while those with resources will continue to purchase alcohol legitimately. Second, it is not going to necessarily stop those who cannot afford the legitimate prices from drinking. Examples from states which have imposed prohibition show that there is an immediate parallel economy that springs up — and a nexus between those who deal in illegal liquor and crime flourishing. Three, illicit liquor also has serious public health implications, and can lead to a sudden rise in hooch deaths. And four, if revenue generation is the aim, hikes have to be reasonable and proportionate. Seventy per cent is excessive. In fact, governments need to recognise the surge in demand — and reform and liberalise alcohol sales. Allow more shops to engage in the liquor trade; allow online delivery — and the increase in volumes will lead to higher revenues. All of this, of course, must be done along with instituting more strict measures for social distancing at shops, and holding liquor vendors and citizens responsible. Indian political leaders have had an uncomfortable relationship with alcohol. However, the solution does not lie in more controls and prohibition, but a more liberal regime with regulation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/dealing-with-india-s-drinking-ht-editorial/story-SxuTy0tf0wgConNdBlo0BK.html
